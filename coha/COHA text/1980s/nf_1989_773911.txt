txt 6 The Art of the Hearth Virginians have a great Plenty and Variety of Provisions for their Table ; and as for Spicery , and other things that the Country do n't produce , they have constant supplies of ' em from England . The Gentry pretend to have their Victuals drest , and serv 'd up as Nicely , as at the best Tables in London . Robert Beverley , in 1705 THE HISTORY of the art of American cooking parallels the history of the quality of American foodstuffs . The Boorstins do not challenge this , they simply turn it upside down . They say colonial cooking was as crude as the colonial food supply . On the contrary , it was as fine as the food supply . Colonial housewives in the North and slave cooks in the South , working at open fires in the hearth , achieved a sophistication and a sensual balance that our modern gourmets would be at a loss to duplicate in their iicrowaved , temperature-controlled kitchen laboratories . American cooking , properly so called , was a blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 // Indians . That of blacks is harder to come by ; there has been little serious study of the question , and most of the recent books on soul food are just gimmick cookbooks . The slave women who cooked in the planters ' kitchens had to learn European techniques ? mostly English and French ? but they must have brought certain culinary tricks with them from Africa . Even two chefs of the same culture , following the same classic recipe , will produce subtly different dishes ; the Chinese speak of " wok signature " or " wok presence " in describing such differences . In this country , different worlds were meeting . The cuisine of New Orleans seems to have absorbed more black influence than that of Virginia . One reason may have been that the basic cuisine in New Orleans was not English but Spanish and French , in part via Haiti . This is important not only because the latter cuisines are more aromatic but also because the role of the mistress of the house was very different . Mulatto mistresses ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans for their cooking as well as their beauty . In Virginia , if the white mistress of the plantation did not know how to cook , she could read to her cook from Hannah Glasse , for instance , or from one of those manuscript cookbooks that many families kept . Jane Carson , in her invaluable Colonial Virginia Cookery ( Williamsburg Research Series ) , cites the recollection of a slave at Monticello , who said that Mrs. Jefferson used to " come out there with a cookery book in her hand " and read pastry recipes to the cook . Cookbooks directed to housewives were peculiarly English ; they were exceedingly rare in France and Spain . Among themselves , the blacks ate very differently . While they had little to work with , they handled it with great skill . They gathered wild greens and scavenged beet tops , and cooked them with the chitterlings , the jowls , the maw , the tail , and other lowly portions of the pig that were granted them . The dish was cooked a long time and was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " pot likker " and it remains one of the favorite foods in soul 72 THE TASTE OF AMERICA cooking . While they came from many cultures , most of them were from West Africa . Distinct regional cuisines were lost , what with strange produce and the intermingling of the tribes , but the segregation of the field slaves tended to perpetuate certain uniquely African characteristics . Black tradition says that they brought many seeds with them to America , among them benne , the Southern name for sesame seed . Very likely . Sesame is actually from the East ( benne is a Malay word ) , but the Arabs , who called it simsim , had controlled the spice and slave trades for centuries and had long since penetrated Africa . Helen Mendes , in The African Heritage Cookbook ( 1971 ) , says that they brought with them okra . Of this there is little question ; the word itself , Webster says , is a corruption of nkruman , a Tshi word from the Gold Coast . However , if they were cooking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been due to the Portuguese , who had been in West Africa since the fifteenth century and who early and enthusiastically took to the tomato . The tomato , of course , is native to tropical America and the very word derives from tomatl , its Nahuatl name ( Webster ) . It is amusing to think that the black slaves may have brought tomatoes to the South ; it is there that we first hear of their use in the United States , and Jefferson reported in 1782 that they were common in Virginia gardens . However , at about the same time , recipes using tomatoes were beginning to appear in English cookbooks , so we can not be certain . The foundation of American cooking in most of the colonies was English cooking of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Readers familiar with the sad state of English food today may not regard that as much of a heritage , but in fact , the level of cooking in those centuries was high indeed , as evidenced by the cookbooks and manuscripts that the settlers brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Art of ( rookery Made Plain and Easy , an English work // popular in America all through the second half of the eighteenth century : Most people spoil garden things by over-boiling them . All things that are green should have a little crispness , for if they are over-boiled , they neither have any sweetness or beauty . Alas .. . Proper English housewives of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries kept manuscript books of recipes , which were handed down from mother to daughter ; one of the duties of girlhood , along with sewing fine seams for a trousseau , appears to have been copying these recipes and learning how to make them . While daughters may have made certain deletions , they tended to make fair copies , adding recipes as they themselves set up housekeeping . In the great houses , the manuscript belonged to the family , with each new mistress bringing her own additions . Others were simple compilations of recipes collected from friends and relatives . These women were not trying to dazzle a public ; they were writing for themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians , are pages from a living past . Printed cookbooks addressed to housewives did not appear until the end of the sixteenth century , when publishers discovered this gold mine . All cookbooks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are based on family manuscripts , and even those households affluent enough to buy such books still treasured their own , and brought them to the New World . Two of these , which may be presumed to have helped shape our cooking , survive in the keeping of the Pennsylvania Historical Society . One is the so-called Martha Washington cookbook , which has long been attributed to Frances Custis , the First Lady 's first mother-in-law . The other is that of the William Penn family . Both are said to have been written down at the // beginning of the eighteenth century , but the recipes are clearly at least half a century older . In a general way , the two collections resemble each other , as well they might , both having come from upperclass English families of roughly the same period . Recipes for beautiful fricassees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puddings by the score , great cakes , fruit pastes , marzipans , ginger breads , and preserves of all kinds show that English women brought to the colonies a rich and varied cuisine that would become the warp , the unifying factor , of American cookery . There is , incidentally , virtually no herb or spice in use in our " gourmet " cookery of today that did not appear in these seventeenth-century manuscripts . As for printed cookbooks , Jane Carson notes that Robert Beverley sold his copy of Robert May 's The Accomplisht Cook ( 166o ) and that John Evelyn 's Acetaria : A Discourse of Sallets ( 1699 ) was in another eighteenthcentury inventory . From her studies of inventories and sales records , she lists the most popular cookbooks in colonial Virginia ; the same list would have been valid in England . Curiously , no cookbooks seem to have been printed in America until 1742 , when William Parks of Williamsburg brought out a shortened version ( very likely pirated ) of The Compleat Housewife by E. Smith ( first published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is a first , and an excellent cookbook , but also because the printer specified that he had chosen recipes with regard to their suitability to American produce . Here are some samples : An Amulet of Eggs , the Savoury Way Take a Dozen of Eggs , beat them very well , and season them with Salt , and a little Pepper ; then have your Frying pan ready , with a good deal of fresh Butter in it , and let it be thoroughly hot ; then put in vour Fggs with four Spoonfuls of strong Gravy ; and have ready Parsley , and a few Chieves cut , and throw // them over it , and when ' t is enough turn it ; and when done , dish it , and squeeze Orange or Lemon over it . A typical omelet of the time . The gravy is pure meat juice , not the floury glop of today . ( Mutton was usually used in England , but the colonials often substituted venison . ) The orange would be the bitter Seville variety , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little old-fashioned at the time . To Make Plumb Porridge Take a Leg and Shin of Beef to ten Gallons of Water , boil it very tender , and when the Broth is strong , strain it out , wipe the Pot , and put in the Broth again ; slice six Penny-loaves thin , cutting off the Top and Bottom ; put some of the Liquor to it , cover it up , and let it stand a Quarter of an Hour , and then put in five Pounds of Raisins , and two Pounds of Prunes , and let them boil ' til they swell ; then put in three Quarters of an Ounce of Mace , Half an Ounce of Cloves , two Nutmegs , all of them beat fine , and mix it with a little Liquor cold , and put in three Pounds of Sugar , a little Salt , a Quart of Sack , and a Quart of Claret , the Juice of two or three Lemons ; you may thicken with Sagoe instead of Bread , if you please ; pour them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical version of the English plum pudding as it was made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . ( Six penny-loaves probably amounted to around five pounds of bread at the time ; the size varied with the price of wheat . Sack is dry sherry . ) Wiping the pot free from scum before putting the strained broth back is a nice touch . It is an excellent recipe . Oyster Loaf is usually associated with New Orleans cooking but here it is , only slightly different , in this English cookbook . ( Gravy is natural meat juice. ) 76 THE TASTE OF AMERICA To stew Oysters in French Rolls Take a Quart of large Oysters , wash in their own Liquor , and strain it , and put them in it with a little Salt , some Pepper , Mace , and sliced Nutmeg ; let the Oysters stew a little with all these Things and thicken them up with a great deal of Butter ; then take six French Rolls , cut a Piece off the Top , and take out the Crumb and take your Oysters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set them near the Fire on a Chafing-Dish of Coals , and let them be hot through , and as the Liquor soaks in , fill them up with more , if you have ' ern , or some hot Gravy : So serve them up instead of a Pudding . Now here is an elegant stuffing for a fowl to be roasted before the fire : Chickens forc 'd with Oysters Lard and truss them ; make a Forcing with Oysters , Sweet breads , Parsley , Truffles , Mushrooms , and Onions ; chop them together and season it ; mix it with a Piece of Butter and the Yolk of an Egg ; then tie them at both Ends , and roast them ; then make for them a Ragoo , and garnish them with sliced Lemon .

This is a rich , well constructed soup . The language is early eighteenth century , but the recipe could have appeared in any **25;463;TOOLONG cookbook . The directions are very clear ? this is a cook speaking to cooks . The skimming and degreasing are excellently arranged , and we see that the quartered nutmeg , so popular in the seventeenth century , was still in use . To give it body , Mrs. Smith uses egg yolks , an elegant touch typical of earlier fine English cooking . The variety and amount of greens in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of cooking disappeared to . ( Colworts , by the way , referred to kale or other non-heading members of the cabbage family . ) Mrs. Smith gives a remarkable recipe for Scotch-Collops which illustrates nicely that Scotch in old English cookbooks has nothing to do with Scotland but refers to " scotching " or scoring the meat : " Cut thin Slices out of a Leg of Veal , as many as you think will serve for a Dish , 78 THE TASTE OF AMERICA and hack them .... " Then you fry them in butter and serve with a sauce of oysters and their liquor , strong broth , shallots , white wine , seasoned with anchovy and nutmeg , and thickened with eggs and butter . No flour . ( The impression is around that the modern gourmets introduced the shallot to America . In Mrs. Smith 's book there is scarcely a recipe , aside from the desserts , that does not call for " an Eschalot or two " and a glass of white wine or claret . This is typical of seventeenth-century English cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A magnificent recipe for stewed carp in the Smith book involves simmering the fish in a quart of claret , the blood of the creature , shallots , herbs , spices , anchovy , verjuice ( classically , green grape juice , but vinegar was often used ) , and the whole beautiful sauce then thickened with half a pound of fresh butter and five or six egg yolks . It can not be overemphasized that these were not considered hifaluting , " Frenchified " recipes ; they were normal dishes from everyday cookbooks . They were , to be sure , intended for comfortably situated families , but upperclass families " had " their recipes and their cooks , much as Boston ladies were said to " have " their hats . Yet this book was reprinted in America precisely because the English editions had been selling well here . It had the customary long chapter on " All Sorts of Puddings , " of a somewhat higher quality than usual , perhaps . There are the expected artichoke pies , sweet spinach pies , tansies , * quaking puddings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best white-wine vinegar " boiled with shallots , anchovies , spices , and mushroom liquor ) , and an exceptionally fine recipe for pancakes that starts out with a pint of cream , eight eggs , and a pound of butter . There are all sorts of typical English cakes , pastries , and cookies . There is an interesting recipe for " A Sweet ? Tansy : a sort of flat omelet , originally flavored with tansy . It was a Lenten dish and may be a vestige of the bitter herbs of Passover . Iiy the eighteenth century , spinach often replaced tansy , and sen ) n the dish was to disappear as well . // Chicken Pye " which calls for " Spanish potatoes " ( sweet potatoes ) , chestnuts , bone marrow , barberries ( not unlike cranberries ) , butter , and spices , all baked together with a cut-up chicken in a coffin ( closed pastry crust ) . When done , one pours over it a caudle , a light , hot custard made of white wine , egg yolks , butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not curdle , " Mrs. Smith warns . The recipe is a direct descendant of the great medieval pies . The first recipe for ice cream known to have been published in America appears in Richard Briggs ' The New Art of Cookery ( 1792 ) . But Americans were making it long before that . Jane Carson reports that the French wife of Governor Thomas Bladen of Maryland served " some fine Ice Cream " among the " Rarities " at a splendid dinner in 1744 . Marie Kimball , in Thomas Jefferson 's Cook Book , mentions that George Washington bought a " cream machine for Ice " in 1784 . Mrs. Kimball , who unfortunately never lists her sources , also gives a recipe that she says Jefferson copied down in France at about the same time . It calls for 2 bottles of good cream , 6 yolks of egg , ' /2 pound of sugar , and a stick of vanilla , cooked as a light custard and then frozen in a sorbetiere using ice and salt . In any case , good recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English cookbooks widely circulated in this country . In Syllabubs and Fruit Fools ( 1969 ) , Elizabeth David says that the earliest recipe she has found in English sources was in the 1756 edition of The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse . It was for " a simple raspberry puree and cream mixture which today we would call a raspberry fool , " she says. * ( The English may have got ice cream from the French ; several recipes appeared in Liger 's Dictionaire Pratique du Bon Menager in 1715 . The French got it from the Italians , of course , and for that matter , the English may have as well ; the Italians are thought to have got it from the East . ) None of these many recipes contained a grain of flour or any of the other nasty * Mrs. David now tells us that she has found this same recipe in the appendix of the 1751 edition of Hannah Glasse. 8o THE TASTE OF AMERICA thickeners that home economists and modern industry have added . Briggs 's recipe calls for a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pint of cream stirred while freezing in a tin pail surrounded by ice and salt . His recipe is virtually identical to one appearing at least three years earlier in The Experienced English Housekeeper by Elizabeth Raffald . A far more historic recipe appears in the 1792 book by Briggs . It is worth giving here in full : To dress Haddock the Spanish Way Take two fine haddocks , scale , gut , and wash them well , wipe them with a cloth , and broil them ; put a pint of sweet oil olive oil in a stew-pan , season it with pepper and salt , a little cloves , mace , and nutmeg , beaten , two cloves of garlick chopped , pare half a dozen love apples and quarter them , when in season , put them in , and a spoonful of vinegar , put in the fish , and stew them very gently for half an hour over a slow fire ; put them in a hot dish , and garnish with lemon . Tomatoes were called love apples ( in Italian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although it is the earliest example we have seen of a recipe that included tomatoes published in this country , it is by no means the first one to circulate here . At least as early as 1756 , there appeared in Hannah Glasse 's popular Art of Cookery a virtually identical recipe to the above. * The olive oil and garlic , as well as the tomatoes , * We had traced the recipe back to the 1767 edition ; Elizabeth David found it in the 1756 edition . Briggs evidently copied it nearly word for word . Interestingly , a printer 's error changed broil to boil sometime after 1756 ; later editions , inchiding the American ones , retained the error . Mrs. David notes this , saying that she does not think that " Mrs. Glasse would have done anything quite so preposterous as boiling a haddock and then stewing it for half an hour . " She comments that all writers of the day " pillaged " earlier writers . " They // would suggest that it was actually a Spanish recipe ; Gerard reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked in sauce . ( The Herball , 1597 ) . He felt that the English had best leave them alone , which they did for nearly two hundred years . A charming tomato recipe , for which we are indebted to Elizabeth David , is for a sauce , the earliest such recipe we have seen . It is in a manuscript from Towneley Hall , Lancashire , dated 1759 . ( The recipe itself , she thinks , may possibly have been entered around 1780 . ) Tomatoes , commonly called Love Apples When they are quite red , roast them so as to be able to peel them , the peal is not made use of , Put the remaining part into a mortar bruise it well , add some gravy of the kind you are going to use , so as to make it of the consistency of pudding , when this operation is done put it in to a pot for to warme , it must not boil , then put it to anything to send to table . Note the niceties of detail ; roasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the warning against allowing them to boil is perceptive . The gravy , as always , is meat juice . The most interesting aspect of the recipe , however , is that it illustrates how cookbooks lagged behind usage ; although love apples were apparently well known at the time , the Hannah Glasse recipe noted above is the only one calling for them that we have been able to find in print for decades . Considering how the tomato was to dominate American cooking , it took an uncommonly long time to get here . Still , judging by Jefferson 's marketing notes , they were in popular use by the end of the eighteenth century ( on had absolutely no scruples , " she says . " One does have the impression that Mrs. Glasse , Mrs. Raffald , Mrs. Rundell and some of the other women writers of the 18th century were more original than the men . E. Smith was good . " 82 THE TASTE OF AMERICA sale as early as July 16 and as late as November 17 ) . So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Cookery ( 1972 ) , " The first recorded American recipes including tomatoes I found were in Miss Leslie 's books , dating from the 185o 's and ' 6o 's . " If Beard had looked in Eliza Leslie 's 1837 book , Directions for Cookery , he would have found six recipes with tomatoes . He would have found more in Mrs. Child 's American Frugal Housewife ( 1832 ) and in Mary Randolph 's The Virginia Housewife ( 1824 ) . They were already called tomatoes and were so listed in the indexes . Under love apples , he could have found them in the first American edition ( 1805 ) of Hannah Glasse 's Art of Cookery . In fact , Beard could have looked in his own book ? he reprints one of Mary Randolph 's tomato recipes ! Up to this point , we have been quoting cookbooks of English origin , for the simple reason that they were the only ones circulating in the colonies . But through the seventeeth and eighteenth centuries , American housewives from Maine to South Carolina were fashioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of cuisines . It was only at the end of the eighteenth century that this broke into print . The first cookbook known to have been written by a native is American Cookery by Amelia Simmons , " an American Orphan , " published in 1796 in Hartford , Connecticut . Many of her recipes are competent but routine presentations of English cookery of the period , but Miss Simmons knew her onions : " The Medeira white is best in market , esteemed softer flavored , and not so fiery , but the high red , round hard onions are the best ; if you consult cheapness , the largest are the best ; if you consult taste and softness , the very smallest are the most delicate , and used at the first tables . Onions grow in the richest , highest cultivated ground , and better and better year after year , on the same ground . " Little is known about Miss Simmons , except that she // described herself as " not having an education sufficient to prepare the work for publication . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , had made errors and substitutions " which were highly injurious . . . without her consent . " ( Already , serpents dwelt in the publishing world . ) But she evidently was a real cook : We proceed to ROOTS and VEGETABLES ? and the best cook can not alter the first quality , they must be good , or the cook will be disappointed . Miss Simmons ' emphasis . These words should be embroidered on samplers and hung in every kitchen , a reproach to all those modern gourmets and home economists who try to disguise the awfulness of our food with the awfulness of their cookery . We sadly note the fact that Miss Simmons ' entire syllabub section ? " To make a fine Syllabub from the Cow , Whipt Syllabub , Lemon Cream , Raspberry Cream , Whipt Cream , and a Trifle " ? appears , virtually word for word , in Susannah Carter 's The Frugal Housewife ( first American edition 1772 ) . They are all very fine recipes . Miss Simmons mentions nine varieties of beans , seven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits that are popular today , with the interesting exception of the tomato . It was common in the South at that time ; perhaps it was less so in New England . Or perhaps she was simply old-fashioned . She roasts turkey on the spit and says to " serve it up with boiled onions and cramberry sauce , mangoes , pickles or celery . " ( Elsewhere , she gives a recipe , " To Pickle or make Mangoes of Melons " ; later writers specify green " muskmelons " to be gathered " a size larger than a goose egg . " ) She also gives an excellent recipe for a tart with " cramberries . " Miss Simmons gives two recipes for that great American dessert , pumpkin pie ; they seem to be the earliest of their kind in print . ( As early as 1682 , Hannah Woolley published a recipe for a " Pumpion-Pye " but it had no resemblance to ours . ) Curiously , she gives them in the pudding section : 84 THE TASTE OF AMERICA Pompkin No. i . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten eggs , sugar , mace , nutmeg and ginger , laid into paste No. 7 or 3 , and with a dough spur , cross and chequer it , and baked in dishes three quarters of an hour . No. 2 . One quart milk , i pint pompkin , 4 eggs , molasses , allspice and ginger in a crust , bake i hour . Her little book was so successful that a second edition appeared the same year " to accommodate a large and extensive circle of reputable characters . " This Albany edition is a far more interesting cookbook : she tells us firmly , for example , in roasting beef that " rare done is the healthiest , and the taste of this age . " She gives a remarkable fish recipe : " To dress a Bass . " The stuffing is aromatic with herbs and wine and enriched with four ounces of butter ; the fish is baked with thin slices of salt pork laid over , sauced with melted butter , and served up " with stewed oysters , cramberries , boiled onions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice Indian Pudding " may be the first ever printed : No .

Salt a pint meal , wet with one quart milk , sweeten and put into a strong cloth , brass or bell metal vessel , stone or earthern pot , secure from wet and boil 12 hours . The 12 hours in the last recipe was one of the editor 's errata ; Miss Simmons corrected it to 6 . Now , anyone who has read English cookbooks of the seventeenth century would recognize that these are not Indian puddings but // English boiled and baked puddings using Indian ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times once upset informed readers when he called the dish " as American as the tomahawk " and offered some " old " recipes that were clearly twentieth-century , with such additives as baking soda . Indian pudding is American in that it applied English cookery to an American product ; the reason there are so many " authentic " ones is that English women brought their pudding recipes here and adapted them . An interesting one , because it calls for ginger and mentions whey ( insisted upon by some purists ) , appears in Mrs. Lydia Maria Child 's The American Frugal Housewife ( 1832 ) : Indian pudding is good baked . Scald a quart of milk ( skimmed milk will do ) and stir in seven table spoonfuls of sifted Indian meal , a tea-spoonful of salt , a tea-cupful of molasses , and a great spoonful of ginger , or sifted cinnamon . Baked three or four hours . If you want whey , you must be sure and pour in a little cold milk , after it is all mixed . Two recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1805 ) of The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse . The book , first published in London in 1747 , had apparently been the most popular cookbook of its time in the colonies ; Gilbert Chinard , in the interesting monograph Benjamin Franklin on the Art of Eating , * suggests that Franklin had some Hannah Glasse recipes translated into French for the use of his cook when he was in Paris . The most interesting thing about the 1805 edition is a chapter called " Several New Receipts adapted to the American Mode of Cooking . " It includes recipes for BuckWheat Cakes , Pumpkin Pie , Dough Nuts , Cranberry Tarts , Whafles , Maple Beer , and " A receipt to make Maple Sugar , " as well as the Indian puddings . The recipes are authentically American . Mrs. Glasse had long since been laid to rest and no hint of authorship is given . They are not lifted from Amelia Simmons . * American Philosophical Society , 1958. 86 THE TASTE OF AMERICA The quality and richness of the recipes should surprise those who believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" The Art of Cookery gives The Order of a Modern Bill of Fare for each month . We must point out that this oldtime , sumptuous arrangement of dishes , a la Francaise , has more in common with a series of buffets or smorgas bords than with modern meals . Guests did not eat all those dishes ; they simply reached for what they wanted . In our view , it was conspicuous waste , but not so wasteful and downright gross as the interminable menus stuffed down by the European and American upper classes in the Victorian era ? and the cooking was demonstrably better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare are interesting as a catalogue of available dishes . Here is the one for March : // It may be objected that this fare was not for every day , nor for everybody . Perhaps not ; such lavish display was undoubtedly reserved for guests in wealthy homes , but the individual dishes were part of the homemaker 's repertory of daily fare , and here lies the essential difference between eighteenth-century cookbooks and gourmet cookbooks of today . Rex Stout , in The Nero Wolfe Cook Book , appeals to the snobbery of the reader : " I beg you not to entrust these dishes to your cook unless he is an artist . Cook them yourself , and only for an occasion that is worthy of them . " Ironically but typically , the gourmet dishes in Stout 's book are not worthy of any occasion ; its merit lies in the home lier American fare , and in Nero Wolfe 's obsession with the quality of the ingredients , which sets him apart from the typical gourmet . This attitude , nearly lost today , im pregnates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first formally regional cookbook printed in America seems to be The New-England Cookery , by Lucy Emer son , published in Montpelier , Vermont , in 18o8 . It is sad to report that whole sections were lifted verbatim from Amelia Simmons-including the errors that Miss Simmons had noted in her 1796 edition . But Miss Emerson did in sert a few recipes of her own , the most interesting of which is one for Oyster Soup : Have ready a good fish stock , then take two quarts of oysters without the beards ; bray the hard part in a mortar , with the yolks of ten hard eggs . Set what quantity of fish stock you shall want over the fire with your oysters ; season it with pepper , salt and grated nutmeg . When it boils , put in the eggs , and let 88 THE TASTE OF AMERICA it boil till it is as thick as cream . Dish it up with bread cut in dice .

Since the book comes from Vermont , it is perhaps understandable that there are no recipes for any of the great New England chowders . More disappointing is the absence of a recipe for baked beans . It would seem that New England women long were diffident about publishing the recipes of those homey local dishes that were in fact masterpieces of culinary art . As printed cookbooks became more and more popular , the tradition of the family manuscript gradually died out . Still , women continued to write down favorite recipes in notebooks . Some survive .

In 1824 appeared one of the most important cookbooks ever published in America . The Virginia Housewife or , Methodical Cook , by Mary Randolph ( 1762-1828 ) , is not only one of the finest ; it may also be called the first truly American cookbook in that all the strands of influence in Virginia cookery were beautifully worked into place . In her preface , she says , " The greater part of the following receipts have been written from memory , where they have been impressed by long continued practice . " She was con- * The brandy in which the rind is steeped is of course added to the other ingredients . 90 3 THE TASTE OF AMERICA sidered the best cook in Richmond at the time ; her heyday was the last decade of the eighteenth century .

" Woven in among them is the French influence in Virginia . This was primarily the contribution of the Huguenots , who fled France around 1700 and settled in various parts of America . Most of them came from the Languedoc , and brought with them their ways for numerous a la daube dishes , " TO HARRICO MUTTON , " and so on . Interestingly , the more elaborate French cuisine that so enchanted Jefferson seems not to have greatly influenced Mrs. Randolph ? except perhaps for the ice cream recipes , of which she gives no fewer than eighteen . So far as we can ascertain , each is the first of its kind in America , and they are of a quality to shame modern Americans .

" Other kinds of ice cream include raspberry , peach , coconut , chocolate , coffee , almond , lemon , and " Lemonade iced " ( a sherbet ) . The most curious one is for a frozen oyster soup . Mrs. Randolph had a lively , intelligent interest in foreign cooking . Recipes for " 011a , " " Ropa veija , " and " Gaspacho " appear among her Southern dishes , always carefully described as Spanish . She tells us how " To make a dish of curry after the East Indian manner " ( and how to blend a curry powder ) far more authentically than thousands of curry recipes in modern gourmet literature . There is a recipe for " Gunlbs ? a West India dish " and also " To caveach // fish , " which is , of course , escabeche , the ancient Arab pickling dish . Caveach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the other recipes would seem to be first appearances in American print . There are , as might be expected , any number of fine Southern recipes , such as " To barbecue a shote " ( young Pig ) , " To corn shote , " and " To toast ham , " to name a few . This last is a forerunner of what we call Virginia baked ham ; it is noteworthy in that it did not have the present sweet spicy glaze . There is also " CATFISH SOUP , An excellent dish for those who have not imbibed a needless prejudice against those delicious fish . " And there is CHICKEN PUDDING , A FAVOURITE VIRGINIA RECIPE . Beat ten eggs very light , add to them a quart of rich milk , with a quarter of a pound of butter melted , and some pepper and salt ; stir in as much flour as will make a thin good batter ; take four young chickens , and after cleaning them nicely , cut off the legs , wings , &c.; put them all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bundle of thyme and parsley , boil them till nearly done , then take the chicken from the water and put it in the batter pour it in a deep dish , and bake it ; send nice white gravy in a boat .

In this case , the liquid in which you poached the chicken will do nicely for the sauce . Following is a recipe for : APOQUINIMIC CAKES Put a little salt , one egg beaten , and four ounces of butter , in a quart of flour ? make it into a paste with new milk , beat it for half an hour with a pestle , roll the paste thin , and cut it into round cakes ; bake them on a gridiron , and be careful not to burn them . These are beaten biscuits , and we have not found an earlier version . The Indian name is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since it would have been black women who beat them , it is possibly an African technique for achieving tenderness . Baking soda makes one appearance , as a substitute for the natural leavening of yeast or eggs , and pearl-ash ( potassium carbonate ) is similarly used in an interesting recipe for " Plebeian Ginger Bread . " Mrs. Randolph seemed perfectly aware that these would cheapen the product ; they are quite out of character with the rest of the book . These chemical leaveners give lightness but an inferior texture to cakes . They also leave faint metallic traces of bitterness ? a taste that , unfortunately , Americans grew to love . These are the only flyspecks in an otherwise impeccable baking section . The bread recipe is fine . Flour , water , yeast , and salt ; not a trace of sugar . " In winter , " Mrs. Randolph counsels , " make the bread up at three o'clock , and it will be ready before bed time . In summer , make it up at five o'clock . " Doubtless the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of recipes using tomatoes . As mentioned , they began appearing in recipes by 1792 , but by the 1831 edition , they are integral parts of twelve dishes . Many must be considered American firsts : tomato ketchup , tomato marmalade , tomato soy , " ochra and tomatas , " stewed tomatoes , scalloped tomatoes , and the Spanish dishes mentioned earlier . There are also two recipes for eggplant , the first we have found in American sources . Like tomatoes , they had long been grown in those parts , however ; Mrs. Randolph says , " The purple ones are best ; get them young and fresh . " How often does one see such advice in a cookbook today ? It is sad to report that Mrs. Randolph likely gave many Americans their first macaroni-and-cheese recipe . She directs that the macaroni be boiled in milk and water until " quite tender " ( God help us ) , then drained , put in layers with cheese and butter and baked in " a quick oven " for twenty to thirty minutes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as it involved only good cheese and butter , it was n't too bad , but in the latter half of the nineteenth century it began turning up in its present horrid form ? overcooked factory macaroni , floury white sauce , and process cheese . The cheese has no more taste than the macaroni , and if it did , the library paste would blanket it . But it has become more American than apple pie . We have a particular affection for a little cookbook called The American Frugal Housewife , Dedicated to Those Who are Not Ashamed of Economy . It was first published in Boston in 1832 by Lydia Maria Child , one of that race of New England women who somehow found the time and energy to care for home and family , to write prolifically , and to promote abolition and other social reforms . She was not a brilliant cook , but many of her ideas are sound , and are the more significant because they were addressed to women of humble means . Thus , she discusses various substitutes for coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without . " Like any good housewife of // her time , she knows that coffee " should be ground soon after roasting , and used as soon as it is ground . " She warns that pearl-ash " injures the flavor of the meal . " Salt fish " should not be boiled an instant ; boiling renders it hard . " To go with it , you cut salt pork into small bits " and try* it till the pork is crispy . It should not be done too fast , lest the sweetness be scorched out . " This is a very old New England dish that Mrs. Child does not dignify with a title ? it is just one of the many ways to fix fish . There is an attractive contrast of textures and tastes that demonstrates how well those New England women worked with unpromising materials . The American Frugal Housewife presents a very early recipe for New England 's classic dish . Baked beans are a very simple dish , yet few cook them well . They should be put in cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are baked . In the morning , they should be put in a colander , and rinsed two or three times ; then again place in a kettle , with the pork you intend to bake , covered with water , and kept scalding hot , an hour or more . A pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans , and that is a large dinner for a common family . The rind of the pork should be slashed . Pieces of pork alternately fat and lean , are the most suitable ; the cheeks are the best . A little pepper sprinkled among the beans , when they are placed in the bean-pot , will render them less unhealthy . They should be just covered with water , when put into the oven ; and the pork should be sunk a little below the surface of the beans . Bake three or four hours . Note , again , the absence of sweetening . Nowadays , it is taken for granted that Boston baked beans are sweet , but it was evidently still a novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornelius noted in The Young Housekeeper 's Friend : " Many persons think it a decided improvement to put in a large spoonful or two of molasses . It is a very good way . " ? Try : render , i.e. , fry gently . // James Beard , in American Cookery , declares that the dish was originally made with maple sugar , which was replaced by molasses . He adds , " my palate can not reconcile the sweetness of syrup or molasses and the simple hardy flavor of pork and beans , " but his recipe includes half a cup of maple sugar or syrup . He felt that it would not be authentic if it was not sweet . His palate here was better than his scholarship . 7 Eliza Cat-fish that have been caught near the middle of the river are much nicer than those that are taken near the shore where they have access to impure food . The small ones are the best . Eliza Leslie THE MosT popular cookbook of the nineteenth century first appeared in Philadelphia in 1837 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our view ranks with Mrs. Randolph 's Virginia Housewife as one of the two best all-American cookbooks ever written . James Beard , be it said , has rendered a service in making Miss Leslie better known to modern cooks . Why does he say , however , when he quotes one of her recipes for scalloped tomatoes , that it is " a very good one even now " ? He surely does not mean " even now when tomatoes are no longer fit to eat , " so presumably he means " even now when cooking has become sophisticated . " In truth , American cookery reached its highest level in the second quarter of the nineteenth century , with Miss Leslie as its guide . From then on , it was downhill all the way . Miss Leslie was sufficiently sophisticated to have written Domestic French Cookery ( 1832 ) , which she described as // a translation . But her classic Directions for Cookery is thoroughly American . It shares with earlier cookbooks a concern for quality that now seems almost alien , and abounds in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " The Portuguese pork , which is fed on chestnuts , is perhaps the finest in the world . " Miss Leslie advises that oysters " may be kept for a week to a fortnight " in a tub of salted water , fed with cornmeal , the water being changed every day . ( An old merchant in the Fulton Fish Market told us that this was still done early in this century , in tank barges along the South Street docks . He said clams had to be fed " on the tide " or they would not eat and the water would spoil . This sort of folklore is unhappily disappearing . ) The recipe for Cat-Fish Soup in Leslie calls for ham ( good old country ham , of course ) , a head of celery , milk , and butter , and is thickened with the yolks of four eggs ? in other words , a sort of elegant chowder . ( She notes that eels or chicken may be handled in the same manner . ) Indeed , the whole soup section is remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went out of her way to let the reader in on what she had learned . Note the grasp of technique in this excerpt from the recipe for Fine Beef Soup : ... Pour on the water , hang it over a moderate fire , and boil it slowly : carefully skimming off all the fat that rises to the top , and keeping it closely covered , except when you raise the lid to skim it . Do not , on any account , put in additional water to this soup while it is boiling ; and take care that the boiling goes steadily on , as , if it stops , the soup will be much injured . But if the fire is too great , and the soup boils too fast , the meat will become hard and tough , and will not give out its juices . The soup is then strained and put in a cool place ( if properly made , it will jelly in the pan , Miss Leslie notes ) until the next day , when the fat and any sediment clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegeTHE TASTE OF AMERICA tables , explaining that too much recooking of the soup would " destroy the flavour , and render it flat and insipid . " " Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the first day , thinking that they improve the flavour , " Miss Leslie writes . " This may be done in common soup that is not strained but is inadmissible if you wish it to be very bright and clear . " This is very nice French technique . Of another soup , Miss Leslie says it should be " of a fine clear amber colour . " She tells how to clarify it with egg white if it is not clear , adding , " But it is better to have the soup clear by making it carefully , than to depend on clarifying it afterward , as the white of egg weakens the taste . " Two recipes , Rich White Soup and Milk Soup , use almonds as integral ingredients . They are direct descendants of the medieval blanc mange , versions of which appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long before the time of Miss Leslie , however , the name blanc mange had been applied to a sweet pudding made with almonds . Our 1826 Wightman manuscript gives such a recipe , which demonstrates admirably the change this dish was undergoing : Blanc Mange Take two ounces of Isinglass cut very small . Pour rather better than half a pint of milk upon it dissolve it over the fire the night before you make it then put a quart of cream to it not too thick three or four laurel leaves &; three or four teaspoonfuls of rose water sweeten it to your taste boil it about ten minutes then strain it for use . You may use almonds pounded instead of laurel leaves if you please . Isinglass is the prepared bladder of sturgeon , which gives a high quality of gelatin . In another connection , Miss Leslie observes that a prepared gelatin was coming into use as a substitute for calves ' feet in jellies , and says , " Its greatest recommendations are convenience and expedition . " // Corruptions were creeping in . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made simply with milk and arrowroot , the ignominious end of a great and ancient dish . Today it is accurately called cornstarch pudding . There are other interesting omens of the approaching decline in our cookery . One is the gradual disappearance of the shallot . Even the admirable Miss Leslie makes only rare use of it , and after her , it virtually disappeared from American cookbooks for a century ? a great pity . Our own hypothesis is that the pervasive flavor of the tomato drove out the shallot as bad money drives out good . Supporting this is the fact that the great variety of ketchups that characterized early American cooking was gradually replaced by the ubiquitous tomato ketchup . Miss Leslie , in 1837 , published recipes for eight kinds : anchovy ( two ) , lobster , oyster , walnut , mushroom , lemon ? and tomato . ( Be it noted again , there was no sugar in any of them . ) Anyone familiar with Chinese cooking will recognize the original source of ketchups , but they came to us from England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Amoy Chinese kit-slap , meaning brine of pickled fish . The Malay kechap , often given as the source , may be from the Chinese as well . ) Until about 185o , when an American recipe called for a spoonful of ketchup , it most likely meant mushroom , walnut , or oyster . These interesting condiments did continue for some decades , but mostly because Miss Leslie 's works continued to be best sellers . Her lobster ketchup uses the flesh and coral from a three-pounder , reduced to a pommade in a mortar , flecked with cayenne , and gradually mixed with a bottle of sherry . She recommends that it be added to melted butter as a fish sauce ; it should be delicious . Another calls for anchovies , shallots , horseradish , mace , sliced lemon , whole cloves , peppercorns , a pint of port , and a pint of Madeira , all boiled down until reduced by half . Used discreetly with rich butter , it would make an admirable steak sauce ? if you go for that sort of thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauces of today , such as President Ford poured on his cottage cheese , were originally based on such formulas ; they are now so hyped up with bad vinegar and chemical preservatives that they ruin the taste of anything they are put to . Miss Leslie 's bread was still an honest loaf , made only of flour , salt , water , and yeast ( either from the brewery or homemade ) . But the cake and quick-bread sections are beginning to look very American : our sweet tooth is becoming more evident and the use of chemical leaveners is increasing . The recipe for Washington Cake cautions , " Take care not to put in too much pearl-ash , lest it give the cake an unpleasant taste . " Usually , Miss Leslie 's good judgment prevailed . Here , she gives the classic recipe for a Sally Lunn : Sift into a pan a pound and a half of flour . Make a hole in the middle , and put in two ounces of butter warmed in a pint of milk , a salt-spoonful of salt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh yeast . Mix the flour well into the other ingredients , and put the whole into a square tin pan that has been greased with butter . Cover it , set it in a warm place , and when it is quite light , bake it in a moderate oven . Send it to table hot , and eat it with butter . Miss Leslie 's New Cookery Book , published in 1857 , gives the same recipe but , as noted in an earlier chapter , finds it necessary to warn that sugar or spice would spoil the cake . Americans were beginning to hoax things up with sugar . An earlier Leslie edition gives an exceptionally fine recipe for Boston Cream Cakes . It calls for a batch of individual cakes , made with 1/2 pound butter and 8 eggs , filled with a custard made with Iz egg yolks , flavored with " a vanilla bean and a stick of the best Ceylon cinnamon , " and a glass of rose water . Perfectly typical of today 's updated recipes for this ELIZA IOI old American sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Evan Jones . It is a banal two-egg cake spread with a filling that has been thickened with onethird cup flour and two miserly eggs . Sic transit gloria . James Beard gives a one-egg version of the cake , and asserts , " Old recipes invariably called for sour milk or buttermilk and soda . " ( Emphasis ours . ) Not Miss Leslie 's old recipe . The point is not just that Miss Leslie 's recipe is richer ? although since sweets can hardly be defended on any ground but sheer gourmandise , they ought to be of the finest quality , or shunned . It is a question of the contrast of textures ; the slightly dense , golden-crusted madeleine type cakes full of buttery goodness have a surprise filling of a beautifully flavored , rose scented , silken custard , uncheapened by flour . The comparison of Miss Leslie 's cakes with the miserly modern version is a perfect illustration of the decline in taste and cooking skills of the past one hundred and fifty years . Mrs. Jones , who , incidentally , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for a recipe in Evan Jones ' book that she calls " Miss Leslie 's Indian Pound Cake . " The ingredients : 6 tablespoons butter , 1 cup sugar , 4 eggs , 1 ' cups flour , 3/a teaspoon baking powder , ? cup white cornmeal , ' /s teaspoon grated nutmeg , teaspoon ground cinnamon , teaspoon vanilla extract , and 2 teaspoons applejack . Shall we turn to Miss Leslie ? Her ingredients for her Indian Pound Cake : ' /2 pound fresh butter , ' /2 pound sugar , 8 eggs " beaten as light as possible , " ' /2 pint wheat flour , I pint fine yellow Indian meal , I nutmeg , I tablespoon cinnamon , a glass of white wine , and a glass of brandy . ( This recipe appears in Directions for Cookery . Miss Leslie 's Seventy-five Receipts , 1832 edition , gives a virtually identical recipe . ) That Mrs. Jones roughly halved the recipe is understandable . But why did she reverse the proportion ( and IO2 THE TASTE OF AMERICA then some ) of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of yellow ? ( Elsewhere , Miss Leslie was quite firm about that . ) Why did she add baking powder , which did not yet exist ? Why did she change the method ? Why did she use two teaspoons of applejack instead of generous amounts of white wine and brandy ? Why in short , did she call it " Miss Leslie 's Indian Pound Cake " ? Occasionally an old recipe may benefit from modernization , but surely the reader should be so informed . It is sad to be obliged to point out flaws in what is in many ways an admirable book . Mr. Jones writes with love and enthusiasm about the regional cuisines of America , but there is no bibliography and one is left feeling unsure of his sources . Although Directions for Cookery was first published in Philadelphia , the Pennsylvania Dutch influence is barely discernible . Scrapple and shoofly pie do not show up , but Miss Leslie does say of cottage cheese , " This is that preparation of milk vulgarly known as Smear Case spreading cheese . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepper Pot , which uses peppercorns rather than the long pod some purists insist upon . There is also what may be the earliest printed version of what came to be pure Americana , cole slaw . ( Amelia Simmons mentions slaw , made with red cabbage , but gives no recipe . ) Miss Leslie calls it Cold Slaw , a typical linguistic substitution of a word of similar sound for another that is not understood . Cole is the old English word for cabbage ( kohl in German ) , still surviving in words like cauliflower and kohlrabi . ( From Latin caulis and Greek kaulos . Cabbage , by the way , comes from French caboche , meaning head , and the word still survives in certain patois . ) Slaw is a simple corruption of salad . It may have conic through either German or English . Miss Leslie recomniended an old-fashioned boiled dressing , the likes of which was to continue as the dressing for cole slaw // and potato salad well into the twentieth century ? when it was displaced by commercial mayonnaise . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , Sylvester Graham issued his tract on the evils of bolted flour ? that is , flour with most of the nutrients removed . The message evidently spread . By 1845 , Graham flour appeared in The Improved Housewife , " by a Married Lady " ( Mrs. A. L. Webster ) , published in Hartford , Connecticut . It is sad to note that one of our earliest " health " - bread recipes is also one of the earliest to call for sweetening ? a pattern that has only intensified since . It is also ironic , because it was precisely the impoverishment of ordinary flour that inspired the addition of sugar . Mrs. Webster 's book also has news for Beard , who says in his American Cookery that before the late nineteenth century , cream pies were not pies at all but " really simple cakes , made in two or three layers with a cream or custard filling . " Well , Mrs. Webster 's cream pie is a sure enough pie , with a filling made of five eggs , a pint of " sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a bit of salt . Beard 's cream pie filling has seven tablespoons of flour , two eggs , and milk or light cream ? " for a rich flavor , use part milk and part evaporated milk " ? and he suggests topping it with " gelatinized whipped cream . " Mrs. Webster 's Connecticut Thanksgiving Chicken Pie is worth a look : In sufficient water to prevent burning , stew old or young fowls , jointed , all but tender enough for the table . Pour all into a dish , and season with salt and pepper to the taste . When about cold , place the parts in your pudding dish , lined with a thin common paste , adding about half a pound of butter to three pounds of fowl , in alternate layers . Take more of the paste ; roll it nine times , studding it each time with butter ( it must be very rich ; ) be careful to roll out , each time , from you , and to roll up towards you , leavI04 THE TASTE OF AMERICA ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper crust ; cut a lip in it ; and ornament it with some of the reserved paste , having first lightly sprinkled the chickens with flour , after almost filling the dish with the liquor in which the chickens were stewed . Pin tight around the rim of the dish a cloth bandage , to prevent the escape of the juices ; and bake from an hour to an hour and a half , in a quick oven . If the top burns , lay a paper over it . One more interesting development was taking place . Most cookbook writers up to and including Miss Leslie measured dry ingredients by weight rather than volume , in baking . Mrs. Webster now announces , " For most preparations , it is easier to measure than to weigh . " But it is not as accurate , dear lady . Flours and for that matter many other ingredients vary enormously in bulk . As if to emphasize the danger , Mrs. Webster 's table of measures contains a blooper that may have caused many a tear : " Butter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , of course , one pint , and anybody who finds measuring butter in a cup easier than weighing it is a ninny . Mrs. Webster was , at best , what one would describe as a good plain cook and yet she , too , reflects some of the superior virtues of her time . On making coffee , for instance , she states firmly , " Old Java and Mocha are the best kinds . " It should be roasted " till the color of chestnuts ... the day it is to be used .... Do not let it boil ; the perfume will be lost by evaporation . Do not make the coffee in a tin vessel . Make it in China , delft-ware , or in silver . " Compare her directions with those in any gourmet cookbook today ... . We have remarked earlier the sensual and knowledgeable approach to flour and bread and beans in Mary Cornelius 's The Young Housekeeper 's Friend ( 1845 ) . The book is interesting on other counts as well . Her Directions Respecting Fish are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . Of this you can judge by their being hard under the pressure of the finger . Fish // lose their best flavor soon , and a few hours make a wide difference in the taste of some sorts . " ( Our emphasis . ) In the 1871 edition Mrs. Cornelius gives this fine recipe for Marblehead Chowder : Fry three or four slices of salt pork , soak a dozen hard crackers , cut up four or five onions . When the pork is fried brown take it out , and lay in half of the crackers , and half the onions . Cut up the cod , and lay the pieces next , then the rest of the crackers and onions , season it with pepper and salt , pour boiling water enough into the kettle to cover the whole . Let it stew moderately an hour . The fish should be fresh from the water . Cod 's heads and sound bones make the richest chowder . Another chowder of hers , which also appears in the earlier edition , ends thus : " Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the first mention we have come across of a milk chowder . Chowders seem so thoroughly American that it is worthwhile to look backward for a moment . Mrs. Randolph , in The Virginia Housewife , published a recipe for " Chowder , a sea dish " : Take any kind of firm fish , cut it in pieces six inches long , sprinkle salt and pepper over each piece , cover the bottom of a small Dutch oven with slices of salt pork about half boiled , lay in the fish , strewing a little chopped onion between ; cover with crackers that have been soaked soft in milk , pour over it two gills 1 cup of white wine , and two of water ; put on the top of the oven , and stew it gently about an hour ; take it out carefully , and lay it in a deep dish ; thicken the gravy with a little flour and a spoonful of butter kneaded together , add some chopped parsley , boil it a few minutes , and pour it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the white wine and beurre manie might suggest a derivation from the French chaudree . That is not to be ruled out ; certainly the word chowder also Io6 THE TASTE OF AMERICA derives from chaudron , or cauldron . However , recipes for chowder were fairly common in English cookbooks ; here is one from The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse ( 1789 edition ) : To make Chouder , a Sea Dish Take a belly piece of pickled pork , slice off the fatter parts , and lay them at the bottom of the kettle , strew over it onions , and such sweet herbs as you can procure , take a middling large cod , bone and slice it , as for crimping , pepper , salt , all-spice , and flour it a little , make a layer with part of the slices , upon that a slight layer of pork again , and on that a layer of biscuit and so on , pursuing the like rule , until the kettle is filled to about four inches cover it with a nice paste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover of the kettle , and let the top be supplied with live wood embers . Keep it over a slow fire about four hours . What is likely , is that the New England chowder derived directly from the primitive " sea dish " rather than the fancied-up versions . The French and English had fished for cod for centuries and the New Englanders took to it immediately . By way of curiosity , we give a recipe that appears in the Albany edition ( 1796 ) of American Cookery by Amelia Simmons : Chouder Take a bass weighing four pounds , boil half an hour ; take six slices raw salt pork , fry them till the lard is nearly extracted , one dozen crackers soaked in cold water five minutes ; put the bass into the lard , also the pieces of pork and crackers , cover close , and fry for 20 minutes ; serve with potatoes , pickles , apple-sauce or niangocs ; garnish with green parsley . // The recipe is not only curious but unclear . As it stands it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that does not make much sense either because the ingredients are for a classic inland chowder and the method does not follow any known early New England procedure . The book is rife with editing errors ; perhaps she intended that the poaching liquid be added and the dish stewed for twenty minutes , rather than fried . Mrs. Cornelius gives us two recipes for clam chowder , one of which , she says , is made with " long clams " : Fry in a deep kettle two large slices of fat pork . Add three large potatoes , sliced thin , and two quarts of hot water . Boil until the potatoes are not sufficiently done to break ; then put in pilot-bread crackers , half a pint of milk , a piece of butter large as an egg , a little salt and pepper . When it again boils up , add a pint of clams , with their liquor . Boil one or two minutes , and serve . Just to balance the picture , we should include a clam chowder with tomatoes ? anathema to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a French chef in New York , gave this one in his Hand-Book of Practical Cookery ( 1867 ) : It is generally admitted that boatmen prepare it better than others , and the receipts we give below came from the most experienced chowder-men of the Harlem River ... . Put in a pot . .. some small slices of fat salt pork , enough to line the bottom of it ; on that , a layer of potatoes , cut in small pieces ; on the potatoes , a layer of chopped onions ; on onions , a layer of tomatoes , in slices , or canned tomatoes ; on the latter a layer of clams , whole or chopped ( they are generally chopped ) , then a layer of crackers . Then repeat the process ... till the pot is nearly full . Every layer is seasoned with salt and pepper . Other spices are sometimes added according to taste ; such as thyme , cloves , bayleaves , and tarragon .

By mid-century , the trickle of new cookbooks had become a stream . Most of those published in the first half of the century did not survive much beyond the 186os , although they were shamelessly cannibalized by the new wave of authors . Mrs. Randolph suffered particularly from this plagiarism ; for example , her recipe for Hare or Rabbit Soup turns up word for word in Mrs. Porter 's New Southern Cookery Book ( 1871 ) , without credit , of course . The reason for the apparent need for new cookbooks was the revolution taking place in our foodstuffs and technology ? notably , the introduction of steel-rolled flour and the generalization of the newfangled kitchen range . Neither development aided the cause of gastronomy ? on the contrary ? but the cast-iron stove was unquestionably a real improvement in working conditions for women . Before we leave fireplace cookery , a word about the miracles achieved there for millennia by womankind . They fashioned a museumful of brilliant contrivances to ease the back and control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot near to or farther from the fire . In Grandmother in the Kitchen ( 1965 ) , Helen Lyon Adamson describes one ingenious device she says she found in an ( unfortunately unidentified ) eighteenth-century source : Roasting Meat on a String Drive a peg into the mantel directly over the center of the fire . Tie to this one end of a stout worsted string . Truss the thing to be roasted and fasten it in the middle of the string ; tie a stone at the other end to hold it down . Depending on the fire , hang the roast near or away from blaze . Set it turning slowly // by twisting the string as taut as the catgut on a fiddle ; the meat will turn as the string unwinds and then rewinds under its own momentum . The string must be twisted when it runs down ( about 5 minutes ) and it is work that any child can be set to do and work he will enjoy . In roasting meat this way , it is well to up-end it when half done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Place a dripping-pan under the roast and , before you start , rub the roast with fat and sprinkle it with flour or cornmeal . Baste from the drippings in the pan . To this day , great numbers of women around the world cook beautiful food over open fires . At an auberge in the hills of Quercy , in France , where there was no stove , we once partook of an eight-course feast that no French restaurant in America could duplicate . We recall especially a fragrant omelet of truffles , cooked in a longhandled skillet over a fire of vine cuttings . In the mountains of Corsica , people still hang hams and sausages from the rafters , where they gradually acquire from the fireplace the taste and texture that only these ancient methods obtain . Where the stove has come , people tend to stop smoking meats . The new iron oven , while satisfactory for many purposes , did not bake bread and pastries nearly so well as the old brick ovens . Saddest of all was the virtual disappearance of roasted and broiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spit . What we call roasting today used to be more properly called baking . Mary Randolph ( Virginia Housewife , 1824 ) says in her recipe for roast turkey to " spit it , and lay it down a good distance from the fire , which should be clear and brisk ... if it be of a middle size , it will require one hour and a quarter to roast . " ( The turkey was , if anything , larger then than now ; we may safely assume that it was 12 to 15 pounds . ) By the time we get to Fannie Farmer , it is baked for three hours and she pours 2 Y2 cups boiling water into the pan , which is not our idea of roasting . Julia Child , also , gives a true home economist 's recipe in IYO THE TASTE OF AMERICA From Julia Child 's Kitchen ( 1975 ) : bake a 12- to 16-pound turkey for 3 ? to 4V2 hours at 325 ? F with an additional margin of 30 minutes ! ( She also claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fireplace , one of our main preoccupations has been to bake a turkey so that the flavor and texture approach that of a roasted bird as nearly as possible . We had occasion to print our Thanksgiving turkey recipe in The Times. * The principle is to roast the bird at a high temperature for a relatively short time ; we have yet to roast a 16- to 18-pound turkey more than two hours . Readers wrote in to say that they tried this " unorthodox " method with " trepidation " ; they all pretty much said they would never again roast a turkey the " old " way . But the high-temperature way is the " old " way and , for that matter , the French way . What it lost in subtle aroma and flavor , the stove gained in ease of temperature control . But along with these developments , as noted , came the chemical leavenings , and the craving for sweetness . The new ovens were great for cakes , and women were baking them like mad ? big , sweet , fluffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These changes did not come overnight , but the pace was remarkable . Women leaders , who were active in campaigns for abolition of slavery , for women 's rights , for education , and for child-labor laws , were doubtless persuaded that all change was progress , especially if it seemed to cut corners in the kitchen . Alas , they were deceived ; the overwhelming majority of women remained as enslaved to their households as before , but their families ate worse . Interesting evidence came in the form of a new genre of cookbook : the collection of favorite recipes of local ladies , often published for charitable purposes . They lack the cohesiveness of a work by a single serious cook , but in some ways they are more revealing of how people ? Scc Appendix . ELIZA III cooked . Among the best-known of the period are The Kansas Home Cook-Book ( Leavenworth , 1874 ) , Housekeeping in Old Virginia ( Louisville , 1879 ) , and Buckeye Cookery ( Minneapolis , 188o ) . The Kansas and Minnesota books are hardly regional ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sodden macaroni baked with floury white sauce and cheese was spreading , but perhaps the cheese was better . Sweet pickles now outnumber sour , and tomato ketchup now calls for a pound of sugar to a peck of tomatoes . Salad dressings are mostly sweet . Desserts , especially layer cakes , occupy an inordinate space . While some of the debasing influences were at work in Old Virginia as well , it produced the best of the three books ; cooks there had a great heritage and tended to be more conservative . There is a splendid Sauce for Cod 's Head that calls for the meat of a freshly boiled lobster pulled in bits , 1/z lb. drawn butter , 1 spoonful walnut ketchup , 1 slice lemon , 1 or 2 slices of horseradish , a little pounded mace , salt , and cayenne pepper , all heated together , with the lemon and horseradish nicely taken out before serving . It is signed Mrs. R ? and is lifted , virtually word for word , from Mrs. Randolph 's recipe of 1824 . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Lynchburg , advises that " Shoat ( which I must explain to the uninitiated is a term applied in the South to a young pig past the age when it may be cooked whole ) should be kept up and fattened on buttermilk , several weeks before being killed , as this makes the flesh extremely delicate . " North and South , however , still cared about coffee , which had to be lovingly blended , roasted , and freshly ground . " Be particular and not allow the coffee to boil , " writes Mrs. Sarah E. Jacobus of Kansas , " as this destroys the peculiar aroma which is the charm of a good cup of coffee . " What is important about these books is that they reflect what Americans thought was good eating a century II2 THE TASTE OF AMERICA ago . For comparison , consider the cookbook prepared by the Republican National Committee for the 1972 campaign , with recipes contributed by members of Congress . The reader can consult these in the Appendix ; we have n't the stomach for them here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve its taste and digestibility . The degree of civilization is often measured by the cuisine . Opening of Mary Lincoln 's Boston Cook Book ( 1883 ) Food is anything which nourishes the body Thirteen elements enter into the composition of the body : oxygen , 62 ' /2 % ; carbon , 2 1 1 % ; hydrogen , I o% ; nitrogen , 3% . . . . The thirteen elements named are formed into chemical compounds by the vegetable and animal kingdoms to support the highest order of being , man . Opening of Fannie Farmer 's Boston Cooking-School Cook Book ( 1896 ) THE ADVENT OF Fannie Merritt Farmer was an historic watershed . Before her , women wrote of cooking with love ; she made it a laboratory exercise . She embodied , if I13 // that is not too earthy a word , all the major ills of twentieth-century culinary teaching . She was the maiden aunt of home economics . Miss Farmer is often thought to be the founder of the Boston Cooking School . In fact , she studied there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became its principal in 1891 , and published a new textbook for it in 1896 , which became the bible of American kitchens . She may have been the first person who learned cooking in a school and promptly began to teach it to others . This became standard American practice . The Boston Cooking School had a solid foundation . Its first principal , Mary Lincoln ( 1879-1885 ) , and a cofounder , Maria Parloa , were excellent cooks . Mrs. Lincoln 's Boston Cook Book ( 1883 ) and Miss Parloa 's Kitchen Companion ( 1889 ) were influential in their day but are now virtually forgotten . A pity . We shall try to remedy this by giving them a major share of the space in comparing them with Miss Farmer 's work , which is unfortunately widely available . They are also more fun . They were almost the last sensualists among authors of major American cookbooks . Mrs. Lincoln was one of the last of a long line of women writers who learned cooking from their mothers . In an earlier chapter , we quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her concession to the use of a little sugar in bread to make up for the deterioration of flour . She is much better on kitchen techniques : It requires practice to make puff paste well ; and as there are so many other dishes more easily made and vastly more important , it is better not to waste time and strength on it . Let your ambition as a housekeeper soar higher than perfection in making puff paste . But those who will have it may observe the following directions . They are much the best directions we have read . Most writers adequately describe the technique of producing a // sheet consisting of hundreds of alternating layers of dough and butter , but they neglect to explain a secret for success : " The number of folds or layers of butter and paste makes the paste flaky , but the amount of air in it makes it rise and puff in baking . " ( Our emphasis . ) That is the reason for the old-fashioned advice to roll lightly and always away from the body ; a back-and-forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lincoln was similarly perceptive about whipping cream . Rich cream " should be diluted and well mixed with an equal quantity of milk . " Eheu , fugaces . As Beard correctly notes , even " heavy " cream today will hardly whip ; he recommends the electric mixer . We prefer a whisk . Mrs. Lincoln favors a whip ( paddle ) churn as giving a better consistency than the newfangled egg beater . To a modern reader , Mrs. Lincoln is remarkable for her honesty and her respect for the work of other craftsmen . She gives the sources for scores of her recipes ; this scruple was never widely held but it virtually disappeared from American food writing with the arrival of Miss Farmer . Some of Mrs. Lincoln 's recipes were already very old , and because they reflect our New England culinary heritage , we will reprint some of them here . Forefathers ' Dinner Succotash is the great dish in Plymouth at every celebration of Forefathers ' Day , December 22 . Tradition says it has been made in that town ever since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed they learned to make it from the Indians . Strangers are rather shy of this peculiar mixture ; but it is a favorite dish with the natives , and to this day is made by some families many times through the winter season . Although the dish has never been made by the writer , it has been tested by her in that ancient town many times , and the excellence of the following receipt is unquestionable . It is given in the name of Mrs. Barnabas Churchill , of Plymouth , a lady I16 THE TASTE OF AMERICA who has made it for fifty years after the manner handed down through many generations . One quart of large white beans ( not the pea beans ) ; six quarts of hulled corn ? the smutty white Southern corn ; six to eight pounds of corned beef , from the second cut of the rattle rand ; one pound of salt pork , fat and lean ; chicken weighing from four to six pounds ; one large white French turnip ; eight or ten medium-sized potatoes . Wash the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the morning put them on in cold soft water . When boiling , change the water , and simmer until soft enough to mash to a pulp and the water is nearly all absorbed . Wash the salt pork and the corned beef , which should be corned only three or four days . Put them on about eight o'clock , in cold water , in a very large kettle , and skim as they begin to boil . Clean , and truss the chicken as for boiling , and put it with the meat about an hour and a quarter before dinner time . Allow a longer time if a fowl be used and keep plenty of water in the kettle . Two hours before dinner time , put the beans , mashed to a pulp , and then hulled corn into another kettle , with some of the fat from the meat in the bottom to keep them from sticking . Take out enough liquor from the meat to cover the corn and beans , and let them simmer where they will not burn . Stir often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like a thick soup , and the beans should absorb all the liquor , yet it must not be too dry . Pare , and cut the turnip into inch slices ; add it about eleven o'clock , and the potatoes ( pared ) half an hour later . Take up the chicken as soon as tender , that it may be served whole . Serve the beef and pork together , the chicken , turnip , and potatoes each on separate dishes , and the beans and corn in a tureen . The meat usually salts the mixture sufficiently , and no other seasoning is necessary . Save the water left from the meat , to use in warming the corn and beans the next day , serving the meat cold . This will keep several days in cold weather ; and like many other dishes , it is better the oftener it is warmed over , so there is no objection to making a large quantity . // The white Southern corn is considered the only kind suitable for this ancient dinner . Notes : We suggest white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shank or brisket , and rand is a dialect word for a long piece of flesh . Clearly , the dish is a blending of Indian and other influences , but pure Yankee withal , in that it had been made since early Plymouth times . Mrs. Churchill is a frequent contributor to the Lincoln book . Here is her recipe for Indian Meal Pudding : Rub a tablespoonful of butter round the bottom and sides of a smooth iron kettle , ? granite or porcelain will do ; when melted , add half a cup of boiling water . This will prevent the milk from burning . Add one quart of milk . Let it boil up , and almost over the kettle ; then sift in one pint of fine yellow granulated corn meal , sifting with the left hand , and holding the meal high , that every grain may be thoroughly scalded . Stir constantly ; add half a teaspoonful of salt , and set away till cold . Then add half a pint of New Orleans molasses and one quart of cold milk . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate , and bake very slowly ten or twelve hours . Put it in a " Saturday afternoon oven " where the fire will keep low nearly all night . Let it remain over night , and serve for Sunday breakfast . Mrs. Lincoln suggests adding a teaspoonful of mustard with one-quarter cup of molasses to a mess of baked beans , explaining , " The mustard gives the beans a delicious flavor , and also renders them more wholesome . " She goes on to say : " Much of the excellence of baked beans depends upon the bean pot . It should be earthen , with a narrow mouth and bulging sides . This shape is seldom found outside of New England , and is said to have been modeled after the Assyrian pots .... Many a New England bean-pot has been carried to the extreme South and West , that people there might have baked beans ' in perfection . " II8 THE TASTE OF AMERICA Mrs. Poor , another of Mrs. Lincoln 's faithful contributors , gave this recipe : An Old-fashioned Boiled Dinner Notwithstanding that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be prepared so as to be both palatable and nutritious for those who exercise freely . It is more suitable for cold seasons . The most healthful and economical way , though perhaps not the old-fashioned way , is to boil the beef the day before . Four pounds of corned beef , two or three beets , a small cabbage , two small carrots , one small white French turnip , six or eight potatoes of uniform size , and one small crooked-neck squash . Wash and soak the corned beef in cold water , and put it on to boil in fresh cold water ; skim , and simmer until tender , but not long enough for it to fall to pieces . Let it cool in the liquor in which it was boiled . Put it into a flat shallow dish , cover it with a board , and press it . Remove all the fat from the meat liquor , and save it to clarify for shortening . Save the meat liquor , but do not let it stand in an iron kettle or tin pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cover them with vinegar . The next day prepare the vegetables . Wash them all , scrape the carrots , and cut the cabbage into quarters ; pare the turnip and squash , and cut into three-quarter-inch slices , and pare the potatoes . Put the meat liquor on to boil about two hours before dinner time ; when boiling , put in the carrots , afterward the cabbage and turnip , and half an hour before dinner add the squash and potatoes . When tender , take the vegetables up carefully ; drain the water from the cabbage by pressing it in a colander . Slice the carrots . Put the cold meat in the centre of a large dish , and serve the carrots , turnips , and potatoes round the edge , with the squash , cabbage , and pickled beets in separate dishes ; or serve each vegetable in a dish by itself . This may all be done the // same day if the meat be put on to boil very early , removed as soon as tender , the fat taken off , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning with those which require the longest time to cook . This will depend very much upon their freshness . But whichever way the dish is prepared , boil the beets alone , remove the meat and fat before adding the vegetables , and serve each as whole and daintily as possible . The next morning use what remains of the vegetables as a vegetable hash . It is interesting to note the diffidence with which Mrs. Poor introduced this recipe ; it explains why these old dishes so rarely appeared in printed cookbooks . Yet it is a magnificent dish . Mrs. Poor was clearly an excellent cook who took pains to tell exactly how she made it , but felt compelled to indicate that it was not always made that carefully . Here is another of her recipes : Bean Porridge Five pounds of corned beef , not too salt , or four pounds of beef and one of salt pork ; one pint of dry white beans , four tablespoons of corn meal , pepper and salt to taste , one pint of hulled corn . Soak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water with a pinch of soda till soft . Put the corned beef and pork in cold water , skim carefully , and simmer four or five hours , or till tender . Take out , and cut into twoinch pieces , and remove the bone and gristle ; also the fat from the liquor . Put the meat and beans into the meat liquor , and simmer very slowly three or four hours , or till most of the beans are broken . Half an hour before serving stir in the meal , first wetting it in cold water to a smooth paste . The meal should thicken the porridge to about the consistency of a thick soup . The meat should be cooked till it falls apart . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Add the hulled corn , and when hot serve with brown bread . Sometimes I20 THE TASTE OF AMERICA the vegetables usually served with a boiled dinner are cooked with the meat , then removed , and the beans cooked as above , in the meat liquor . " This old-fashioned and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food- at my grandmother 's farm in Northern New Hampshire eighty years ago . When cooked , it was poured into bowls or basins holding from a pint to two quarts . A nice tow string was laid in a loop over the edge , and the porridge was placed where it would freeze . By holding the dish in hot water it would cause the porridge to slip out ; then it was hung up by the loops in the buttery , ' and was considered best when nine days old . ' At early dawn the men folks ' who went into the forest chopping ' would take the skillet , or a little three-legged iron kettle , some large slices of rye and Indian ' bread in their pockets to keep it from freezing . The porridge was hung , wrapped in a clean towel , upon the sled stakes . Their spoons were made of wood . The hay that lay on the floor of the ox sled was of use to keep their feet warm , and given to the oxen for bait ' at noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' they kindled a fire by the aid of a tinder box , ' warmed their porridge , and with their brown bread enjoyed this strong food as no modern epicure can his costly French dishes . " It is to be remarked that this recipe was given to Mrs. Lincoln prior to 1883 , so we are being permitted a glimpse of daily life around 1800 , and there is every reason to believe that the dish is much older . The pinch of soda is interesting ; it means that the water in northern New Hampshire was hard . ( One of the bits of lore that an assiduous reader of old cookbooks learns is that dried peas and beans must be cooked in soft water ; old French books specify river or fountain water , not well water . On the other hand , fresh peas and beans are to be cooked in hard water ; it preserves color and texture better . ) It is interesting also that Mrs. Poor felt obliged to put in ( potation marks the word " Indian " when referring to cornincal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FANNIE I2I great deal from the Indians ? cornmeal , parched corn , hoecake , and much more ? all the so-called Indian pudding and bread recipes we know were clearly adaptations of English recipes using Indian meal . An example is Maria Parloa 's recipe for Indian Waffles in The Kitchen Companion ( 1887 ) . Maria Parloa was an interesting writer who reportedly studied with Pierre Blot in New York , headed her own cooking school there , and wrote several books before helping to found the Boston Cooking School . She must have influenced a whole generation of cooks and cookbook writers , but she seems to be totally forgotten today . She seems to have had a better knowledge of French cuisine than do many of our modern " gourmet " cooks . She understood the role of the Seville orange in her sauce for duck ; if it is unavailable , she says , grapefruit might be tried because " it has a little of the peculiar bitter flavor that makes the Seville orange desirable . " Of the new bleached asparagus she says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compare in flavor or tenderness with the old-fashioned green asparagus . " Like Jefferson seventy-five years earlier , Miss Parloa offers a market list that includes all the common vegetables and herbs , and many that may be hard to find in a friendly neighborhood supermarket today : salsify , kohl-rabi , egg-plant , okra , celeriac , shallots , rocamboles , Spanish onions , escarole , Monk 's beard ( endive ) , garden and water cress , sorrel , lamb 's lettuce or corn salad , chervil , borage , and tarragon . But she is not a lifted-pinky gourmet . She is not above giving us an admirable recipe for a plebeian Yankee dish , such as this one : A Salt-fish Dinner Outside New England a salt-fish dinner is hardly known , and even in that section it is rarely served in such perfection in the interior as it is in the towns bordering on the coast . To the uninitiated it may I22 THE TASTE OF AMERICA seem to be a very insignificant meal ; but to those who know what it really is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt-fish dinner calls for care and skill . The materials should be of the very best . Codfish is the only suitable fish to use , and dunfish is better than white ; the process of curing the former being preferable to that of curing white fish , and the result being a darker and richer fish .... The fish never should be cut before cooking . Preparation of the Fish A genuine salt-fish dinner is composed of a whole salt cod , beets , carrots , onions , potatoes , salt pork , butter , hard-boiled eggs , flour , salt , and pepper . The night before the dinner is to be served , wash the fish carefully .... Put the fish into a large pan , skin side up ; and soak it over night in sufficient water to cover it . The next day place the fish , skin side up , in a fishkettle or in a large pan . Place on the fire where the water will heat slowly to the boiling-point without actually boiling ; then set back where it will keep hot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the fish boil , it will break into soft , rich , gelatinous flakes when served ; but if it be boiled , it will be dry , thready , and hard . Miss Parloa goes on to describe in great detail the cooking of each vegetable , and the slow frying of the cubes of salt pork until they become brown and crisp . Now here is her recipe for the obligatory egg sauce that goes with it : Egg sauce is made by beating together half a cupful of butter and a table-spoonful of flour ; adding half a pint of boiling water ; setting the saucepan on the fire , and stirring until the sauce begins to boil ; immediately drawing the saucepan back , and adding half a teaspoonful of salt and half a salt-spoonful of white pepper ; chopping two hard-boiled eggs rather fine , ? doing it with a plated knife or spoon , ? and adding therm to the mixture already prepared . // These homey dishes are part of our heritage , yet recipes for them are surprisingly rare . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptive , and characteristic of her entire repertory . In preparing the vegetables , she says , " Beets may be boiled without washing . When they are washed , the little roots are apt to be broken , and the juices escape . This impoverishes the vegetables and spoils the color . " It is a splendid dish , lovingly and intelligently presented . While the egg sauce , purely English in origin , can not be compared to the aiolli , the dish stands up in its own way to the great boiled salt cod dinner of Provence , which is also called aiolli because of the obligatory accompaniment of that redolent amalgam of garlic and fruity olive oil . Mrs. Lincoln and Miss Parloa , then , were good cooks , who with some embarrassment yielded to the decline in produce and standards of their time . With Fannie Farmer , embarrassment disappears , and with it the love of food . We began this chapter with the opening lines of the Lincoln and the Farmer textbooks . Mrs. Lincoln puts taste first , Miss Farmer chemical composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same today . ) Miss Farmer 's first recipe tells how to detect the presence of starch ( CsH1005 ) by the addition of a weak solution of iodine ; it will turn " an intense blue . " Scrumptious . As noted , Miss Farmer 's book early became , and still remains , the bible of the American kitchen ; now in its twelfth edition , it has sold more than three million copies . A certain mythology has grown up around it . In the current paperback edition , for example , it is claimed that she " invented " precise measurements of ingredients by volume rather than by weight . This would be a dubious honor , if it were true . As early as 1845 , Mrs. Webster was counseling her readers to measure by volume , and we learn from her chart that " sixteen Spoonfuls are half a pint . " Mrs. Lincoln , in I24 1 THE TASTE OF AMERICA her Boston Cook Book ( 1883 ) , spent three and a half pages on how to measure accurately . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and levelled off with a knife . " The measuring cup , we learn , had been accepted for decades as containing one-half pint , and was marked to show one-quarter and one-third cups . She maintained that , with her table of measures , " the cup and spoon may be used as accurately as the scales . " So while Miss Farmer did ban forever the rounded measure and " butter the size of an egg , " ( an old-standby direction , translated by Mrs. Lincoln as one-quarter cupful or two ounces ) , she introduced nothing new . We repeat that , where accuracy is necessary , weight is more precise than volume . Any real cook knows that eggs are not identical , that flours vary astonishingly , that baking powders are not all alike , and that even salt varies in saltiness ; blind dependence on accurate measurements is naive . Finally , one must depend on feel and taste . This Miss Farmer did not allow ; it was , perhaps , too sensual . Her attitude became the law for American food editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving cookbook about the art her mother had taught her , the question of measurements arose . " Can you measure life ? " she retorted . " How can I tell you ? I do n't know how much you want to put in . " The trouble is that many people no longer know how much they themselves want . A woman in a New York publishing house complained , " I never know what they mean when they say , season to taste . ' " While Mrs. Lincoln attributed many of her recipes to the donors , including Miss Parloa , " Mrs. Towne 's Matilda , " " an unknown friend , " and so on , the only source credited in Miss Farmer is an unidentified " French Chef , " to whom she assigns several exotic recipes such as mulligatawny soup . Clearly , she did not create hundreds of recipes out ( d the blue . She learned cooking from Mrs. Lincoln 's book // ( the textbook at the Boston Cooking School at the time ) , but did not acknowledge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources need not be attributed ; Miss Fannie , however , exaggerated in this regard . She was by no means the first to appropriate other people 's recipes as her own , but as the patron saint of American housewives she put her seal of approval on it , and contributed to the moral climate of the cookbook world today , where plagiarism is the norm . Among other things , this practice cuts us off from the past , so charmingly revealed by some of the Lincoln recipes quoted earlier . We have mentioned how Miss Farmer hyped up her breads with ever-increasing amounts of sugar . She poured it on with a heavy hand in whatever she was doing . Take salad dressings : In the original 1896 edition , there are thirteen recipes , of which ten have sugar ? including the mayonnaise . By the 1914 edition , the last one that Miss Farmer edited , fourteen out of seventeen salad recipes have sugar , and the amounts have increased . She has , for example , added sugar to her tomato aspic . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special variation , put in a jar I/2 cup commer-cial mayonnaise , 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/a cup sugar ( more seasonings if you like ) and shake well . This American fixation on sweet salads , so well docu-mented in the succeeding editions of Fannie Farmer , was , shall we say , firmly set by the invention of Jell-O in 1897 , a fitting close to the late nineteenth century with its steady decline of taste . Sugary , gummy messes , chock full of synthetic flavors and colors , blanketed the country . Fruit salads , each less believable than the preceding one , dominated the salad section of the 1914 Boston Cooking-School Cook Book . Lemon Jell-O now was the popular substitute for aspic . There is a Brazilian Salad that begins , " Remove skin and seeds from white grapes and cut in halves lengthwise , " and goes on with pineapple , apples , I26 1 THE TASTE OF AMERICA celery , Brazil nuts ( whence the name of the dish ) , lemon juice , and a sweet mayonnaise . Another recipe pours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Miss Farmer had already , in 1896 , given us this gem : Remove one section of skin from each of four bananas . Take out fruit , scrape , and cut fruit from one banana in thin slices , fruit from other three bananas in one-half inch cubes . Marinate cubes with French Dressing . Refill skins and garnish each with slices of banana . Stack around a mound of lettuce leaves . It must have made a charming display . That is pure women's-magazine gourmet cookery . Insane " fancy " combinations of ingredients without regard to balance of taste and texture are commonplace now ; a favorite of ours is a published recipe for a hamburger with chopped peanuts and bananas , including the instruction : " Mash bananas with mustard to taste . " But it was unusual in Miss Farmer 's time . It is clear that the dour spinster had at least one vice : a craving for sugar . This may have been the secret of her success , which is otherwise inexplicable . Americans were eating baked goods of poor flour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it to them . In her 1914 edition there are five recipes involving marshmallows ; soon , they would be added to salads .... Her sauces were so full of flour they could nearly stand up alone ? her Bordelaise Sauce calls for 31/2 tablespoons of flour for I cup of stock . She calls for eight minutes of simmering in this recipe , an unprecedented concession to finesse ( Escoffier calls for some 41/2 hours , minimum , and uses less than one tablespoon of flour ) . Her other sauces call for no simmering whatsoever , even the bechamel . The lady was a very poor cook , and singlehandedly was responsiblc for a great deal of what is wrong with modern Anurican cooking . It is a mystery how James Beard was able to say for the jacket of the facsimile 1896 edition : " Fannic Farmer remains one of our gastronomic deities ! // She was equally at home with the traditions of American cooking and the intricacies of French cuisine . " Before we leave the nineteenth century , let us take a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontier , of course , the sharpest sauce was a good appetite ; the foods were good , in the main , but there was neither time nor ingredients for such refinements . The well-to-do colonists , as noted , relied on English cookbooks from the golden age of English cookery . The sauces were most often formed in the cooking process , as in fricassees and stews . The older ones were not thickened at all , but simply served with sippets ( dry-toasted bread ) to sop up the broth . Occasionally , bread and sippets were allowed to soak and simmer imperceptibly until they were integrated into the sauce ? what the French call mitonner , a process still used in country soups . Elegant kitchens used egg yolks , butter , and cream for liaison of sauces ; this was still most often recommended by Hannah Glasse as late as 1805 . Amelia Simmons ( 1796 ) treated sauces only in passing . Water fowl requires onion sauce , she says . This would be a sort of soubise : onions cooked until soft , seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simmons suggests that a fowl have " a pint of stewed oysters , well buttered and peppered . " Gravy meant the natural meat juices and was often simply " buttered and a spoonful of catsup added . " Until the second half of the nineteenth century , ketchup usually meant a pickle of mushrooms , oysters , or walnuts . Mrs. Randolph gave a recipe for tomato ketchup in 1824 and it quickly became popular , but it was specified as such . A sophisticated and elegant cook , Mrs. Randolph most frequently called for a sauce of melted butter and parsley . Occasionally , she added a spoonful of mushroom ketchup . Sometimes she used butter or yolks to thicken a sauce , but the butter would likely be first rolled in flour ? 2 teaspoons of flour to 1/4 pound of butter ? a sort of beurre manie . The proportion of flour to butter is about oneI28 THE TASTE OF AMERICA fourth the classic formula ( equal amounts by volume ) , so it can be seen that butter was the main liaison . Miss Leslie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter to sauces . Most of them have no flour whatsoever but a few call for beurre manie . There is a section on Store Fish Sauces , meaning sauces that keep well . Here is an interesting one : General Sauce Chop six shalots or small onions , a clove of garlic , two peach leaves , a few sprigs of lemon-thyme and of sweet basil , and a few bits of fresh orange-peel . Bruise in a mortar a quarter of an ounce of mace , and half an ounce of long pepper . Mix two ounces of salt , a jill %2 cup of claret , the juice of two lemons , and a pint of Madeira . Put the whole of these ingredients together in a stone jar , very closely covered . Let it stand all night over embers by the side of the fire . In the morning pour off the liquid quickly and carefully from the lees or settlings , strain it and put it into small bottles , dipping the cork in melted rosin . This sauce is intended to flavour melted butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a common practice to add such homemade sauces to melted butter ; if they were well made and used with discretion they must have been excellent . At least , they had character ; the butter gave richness and texture , and there was an interesting tang and aroma from the better of those " Store " sauces . What came later had all the charm of library paste . White sauce , or bechamel , became the rage . It was believed to be very French . Indeed , the quality of French sauces also declined in the nineteenth century , but the French would never have recognized the bechamel and Espagnole recipes that began to appear in American cookbooks , and clog them to this day . From the beginning , they demonstrated our infantile drsirr to achic%-e dazzling results with no expenditure of // time or effort . We wanted to do " fancy cooking " without learning the techniques required . In this effort , Fannie Farmer was a trailblazer . Beginning with her , the home economists , nutritionists , and instant chefs pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions for other noncooks . No longer were taste , texture , freshness of produce lovingly discussed . Nor would technique be sensual , and individual . From now on , things would be measured by the one-eighth teaspoon and the milligram of riboflavin . Welcome to the twentieth century . Fannie reigned unchallenged until the Joy of Cooking by Irma S. Rombauer appeared in 1931 . The first edition was privately printed ; it was an immediate success and it is claimed to be the best-selling cookbook of all time . The book 's prime virtue is its chattiness ; Mrs. Rombauer wrote about cooking with enthusiasm if not discernment . Indeed , it is said that she wrote the book in protest against the antiseptic , loveless approach of Fannie Farmer . There are good things in Rombauer ; she tells us how to churn butter , how to make cheese , how Janka made strudel , and how the sausages were seasoned at butchering time in their valley . Unfortunately , the book has many of the flaws we have been discussing , such as sugar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , shortening , and S teaspoons of sugar for a small batch ? the French permit only flour , yeast , salt , and water ) . There is the usual appalling collection of sweet gelatin salads and dressings . The 1943 edition devoted eight pages to canned-soup combinations ; one of them is for Mongole Soup : I should like to sing a paean of praise about this and the following soups made with a basis of pea and tomato . If there is anything better in the hurry-up culinary art I do n't know what it is . Rich ? Yes , but you may plan to serve simple food afterward . This is worth adding a fraction of a pound to your avoirdupois . Only do n't fall in love with it and serve it too often .
