When the conversation shifts from what a limited choice there is among presidential candidates , Walter Cronkite is one of the names that always turn up as for-instance alternatives . Eight years ago , he was one of ten possible vice-presidential running mates listed by Democrat George McGovern . Last week the New Republic quoted him as saying he would be honored if asked to accept a similar spot on Republican John Anderson 's independent ticket . Obviously such a remark must have given CBS fits , putting in jeopardy in the midst of the campaign its star anchorman 's reputation for neutrality . Cronkite , off on a sailing holiday , said he had been " misinterpreted . " The stir makes a point : as the man the country trusts most to bring it the news , Cronkite seems to have a calm and sensible response to events . What if he were put in charge of them ? <P> Unthinkable ? Less so in an era when a movie actor and a peanut farmer are front runners for the presidency . " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As I 've daydreamed about sailing around the world-or rather , not as much , because I have thought of sailing around the world . " <P> His thinking goes like this : " Obviously anybody in any profession has a perfect right to get into politics . But one should n't as a journalist serve two masters .

Popularity on TV might have great appeal , but I do n't have any policy on how to run the country . " <P> Cronkite retires as an anchorman in 1981 . He considers himself independent , has never registered as Republican or Democrat , and does n't always vote . " I 'm not totally pleased if people find me more trustworthy than others-that 's what we 're all about in this business , " he says . Besides , the trustworthiness is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineate your positions , you 'd start to lose them . Another factor : I know I ca n't make compromises to suit the people that would put me up , that I 'd have taken money from . " Even so , he is tempted . Unlike most political reporters he thinks campaigning , and the plaudits that come with it , would be fun , and that " it might be interesting to serve in the United States Senate , for instance . " He adds with a familiar grin : " Do n't think because I 'm such a glib talker on the subject that I 've considered it a lot . "
