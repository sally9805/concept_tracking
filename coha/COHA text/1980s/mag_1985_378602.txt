Ronald Reagan 's best friend is freedom . It did most of the work for him in Geneva . It was on his shoulder when he was walking Mikhail Gorbachev down toward the lake . It was tiptoeing around the room in the Chteau Fleur d'Eau and may even have whispered in Gorbachev 's ear . <P> The thing one has to understand is that when others doubt and hesitate , Reagan trusts freedom  --  in politics , in trade , in prayer . When the Soviet double defector Vitaly Yurchenko spilled his story in Moscow to embarrass Reagan just before the summit , the President leaned back and listened . Yurchenko said the CIA drugged him and his complexion turned green , then they took him out to play golf so he could get a tan , and next they escorted him to dinner with the CIA 's director Bill Casey , whose fly was unbuttoned . Reagan doubled up with laughter . So did the free world , the people Moscow was trying to impress with that hilarious yarn . <P> When the USIA 's director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Geneva , the Los Angeles Times 's talented Washington bureau chief Jack Nelson asked him why U.S. Government spokesmen were just arriving when the Soviets had been putting out propaganda for days . Answered Wick : " You were here , Jack , that 's all we need . " Indeed , Nelson and his thousands of other colleagues in the free press were dispelling hogwash on all sides the moment they arrived in the old city . <P> Jesse Jackson thought he was a sly one getting to see Gorbachev during the summit to show the world that some Americans oppose Reagan 's arms buildup . That was probably a hit in Minsk . In Peoria , however , such a cute maneuver probably kindled resentment against both Jackson and Gorbachev . <P> The Kremlin 's propaganda heavies did have their moments until a hundred-pound dissident , Irina Grivnina , only three weeks out of the Soviet Union , took them head on in one of freedom 's forums , the press conference . Not used to such tumult , the Soviets stomped off the stage in anger while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evened by another determined woman , Avital Shcharansky , the hauntingly beautiful wife of Dissident Anatoli Shcharansky , still held in a Soviet prison after eight years . Bella Abzug , the American liberal agitator , was met on Geneva 's free streets by Phyllis Schlafly , a banner bearer of the right . <P> What happened in Geneva was participatory summitry . Reagan went about his business as he always does in that environment , firmly rooted in Thomas Jefferson 's doctrine that freedom is a God-given right and James Madison 's conviction that some participants will try to corrupt freedom , but more will try to protect it . <P> Freedom , for all of its noise and confusion so evident at the Geneva summit , imposes standards of behavior for those who want approval in its open bazaar . Boors and bullies are these days most often put down in the long run of events . <P> Mikhail Gorbachev had every opportunity to behave in the worst Soviet tradition , fuming and pounding like Nikita Khrushchev did to Ike and Kennedy . He did not . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , " Gorbachev said . Even when he was asked about Andrei Gromyko 's characterization of him as a man with " iron teeth " behind a nice smile , Gorbachev declined the old role . " It has n't yet been confirmed , " he said . " As of now , I 'm still using my own teeth . " Reagan 's friend freedom was surely watching , and Gorbachev felt it .
