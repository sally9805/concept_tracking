Bible Boar <P> Author Sinclair Lewis , whose position as National Champion Castigator is challenged only by his fellow idealist , Critic Henry Louis Mencken , has made another large round-up of grunting , whining , roaring , mewing , driveling , snouting creatures-of fiction-which , like an infuriated swineherd , he can beat , goad , tweak , tail-twist , eye-jab , belly-thwack , spatter with sty-filth and consign to perdition . The new collection closely resembles the herd obtained on the Castigator 's last foray , against the medical profession ( Arrowsmith , 1925 ) and a parallel course is run , from upcreek tabernacles , through a hayseed college and seminary to a big-city edifice with a revolving electric cross . This time the Castigator singles out the biggest boar in sight and hounds him into a gratifyingly slimy slough . The tale has an obscure hero , another Lewisian lie-hunter who , to purge the last bitter dregs of pity and fear , gets his gentle eyes and mouth whipped to a black pulp by the K. K. K. before he is released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the inimitable Lewis smack , Elmer Gantry. * <P> Mrs. Woolf 's Way <P> The significance of Virginia Woolf's+ last novel , Mrs. Dalloway , was that her " stream of consciousness " method was not only startlingly original but startlingly successful as well . In To the Lighthouse the stream-of-consciousness technique is present as before but its presence is subtler , more diffused . Weaving , stalking , spying from thickets , she discovers the nature of her prey . The actual capture she leaves to those who , reading her book , are her companions in the chase . <P> <P> Mortal Fairyland <P> The Magic Mountain-Thomas <P> Mann-Knopf ( 2 vol. $6 ) .
