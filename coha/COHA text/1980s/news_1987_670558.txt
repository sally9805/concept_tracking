But although he was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ' official dressmaker during her days as First Lady , the room gives few hints of his primary occupation as a designer. // It was there that Mr. Cassini , who is 74 years old , recently discussed his new autobiography , " In My Own Fashion " ( Simon &; Schuster , $19. 95 ) . He acknowledged that , like his surroundings , his book does not reveal as much as one might expect about his half-century in fashion. // // A Pursuit of the Good Life // His tale is more a conqueror ' s than a couturier ' s . " My goal in life , " he writes , " was to pursue the good life . " And the story of that life is also filled with trophies of a sort : the names of women he claims to have won . Just as his home seems to have been decorated with props to support his self-image as a man of action , his book often seems to have been written to prove his existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful girls , " he writes . The list is extraordinary . It begins on page one with the wet nurse who he says introduced him to sensual pleasures . It includes two wives - Merry Fahrney , the heiress to a cough syrup fortune , and Gene Tierney , the actress - as well as Grace Kelly , to whom he says he was briefly , albeit unofficially , engaged. // There are other women : prostitutes , heiresses , debutantes and showgirls he met in Florence , Italy , where his displaced family settled after the Russian Revolution , and in New York , where he struggled during the Depression and shone as a star of cafe society during the 1950 ' s and 60 ' s . <> <> Taking Credit for a Look // There are starlets from his days as a costume designer in Hollywood , among them Marilyn Monroe . And there are a multitude of others , including fashion models who worked for him when he was a designer ( seven of whom he identifies only by the day of the week he spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks he takes credit for , ranging from Veronica Lake to Mrs. Onassis. // Many of Mr. Cassini ' s attitudes place him squarely as a man of his time . He does not believe , for example , that his attitude toward women was or is exploitive . " I needed affection and I did it the old-fashioned way : I earned it , " he said. // Speaking of the models he called his " harem , " he added : " I gave friendship , direction , material advantages because of the jobs . I paid them extremely well . I worshiped them in fact , because those girls made my collections. " // Mr. Cassini is also proud of the success of his fashion collections . " I ' m the first American designer who went all over the world , " he said . " I was able to show that we are as good as anyone , given the same opportunities . The designer was not going in the back door with a mouth full of pins . He was an important person . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been well-treated. " // Mr. Cassini ' s claim to fame was his collaboration with Mrs. Onassis when she was Mrs. John F. Kennedy . Together , they created what became known as the " Jackie Look , " based on classic A-line dresses . It was unveiled at Mr. Kennedy ' s inauguration . The fame Mr. Cassini received as her designer and his knack for exploiting it helped him become a pioneer in fashion licensing : the selling of a label to manufacturers of a wide variety of " designed " products. // It is more difficult to get him to detail his current position in fashion , a subject he does not deal with in the book . " This was eliminated for the sake of the commercialism my editor wanted , " he said . <> <> Speculation About His Earnings // The New York telephone book lists 13 Cassini signature businesses , in men ' s , women ' s and children ' s clothes and in watches . Mr. Cassini said he currently has about 50 licenses and a worldwide retail volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowledgeable sources in fashion say his 1984 volume was about $100 million . Asked what he designs today , he responded with a question . " What is more important , the reality or the perception ? I am perceived to be an important designer . It ' s enough for me. " // " A man is as good as his best work , " he continued . " Do I have to compete with any obscure designer ? Or do I want to create another dimension , the designer-celebrity ? There is the old fashioned way : can he put a dress together from beginning to end and make it a work of art ? Or can he direct many enterprises that have a flavor that is peculiarly his own ? I choose the second one. " // Mr. Cassini admitted that he has not always taken his work in fashion seriously . " A worse salesman , you couldn ' t find , " he said. // During the height of his success from the 50 ' s to the 70 ' s , he would narrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke names ; " Missionary ' s Downfall " described a dress with shoulder straps designed to fall. // Some of his designs have been taken seriously ; for example , his work for Mrs. Kennedy and some of the men ' s fashions he created during the Peacock Revolution of the 1970 ' s ( Nehru jackets and brightly colored dress shirts ) . Nonetheless he has rarely been granted critical praise equal to his reknown . <> <> ' With Malice Toward None ' // He said that he wrote his book " with malice toward none " and asserted that he is a man " with very little resentment . " But the book and his conversation are full of both . He directs particular ire at the Communists who took away his family ' s wealth ; at the Hollywood establishment that considered him an unwanted " Mr. Gene Tierney " ; at Grace Kelly ' s entourage , whom he refers to as " gnats and mosquitoes , " and at the disapproving families of both Gene Tierney and Grace Kelly. // But most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely took him seriously. // He said his problems often stemmed from the fact that he " was bred to be a man with a sword and ended up a man with a pin . " His antagonists , he said , drove him into cafe society and the arms of its women , whom he described as the " soldiers " who protected him and gave him approval. // " The day was to struggle , " he said . " The night was for forgetting . I had severe doubts I could make it in this battleground . I always felt I was inadequate . A refugee like I was needs some base of support . I didn ' t have anybody . " <> <> The World That He Lost // He also said it was the need for approval that drove him to battle with his fists . " I may have a chip on my shoulder , " he said . " I don ' t see it . Remember the trauma of the world that I lost . That may have given me too sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately to prove myself . I spent half my life being hurt . The leftovers of hurt are an automatic gesture , like a dog that salivates. " // The leftovers of hurt are also what make his story more than an exercise in vanity and a series of complaints . For a humanity emerges that provides some balance to the rest of the book . That is evident in Mr. Cassini ' s recital of his grief over the end of his relationships with Miss Tierney and Miss Kelly . And there is a particular poignancy in the story of his first daughter , who was born blind and retarded after Miss Tierney was exposed to German measles by an over-zealous fan during her pregnancy. // " I look at this book as a catharsis , as an audit of my life in which I don ' t pretend to be better than I am , " he said . " But I think I ' m better than I was. " //                  @ @ @
