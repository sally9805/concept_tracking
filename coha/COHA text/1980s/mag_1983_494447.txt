What the media extravaganza failed to tell us . J.F.K. 'S TELEVISION PRESIDENCY BY HENRY FAIRLIE DID JOHN F. KENNEDY exist ? The question is not facile . It is the natural response of anyone who followed the nation 's month-long observance of the twentieth anniversary of his assassination . From the scores of network and local television programs , from the millions of words that appeared in newspapers and magazines , from the books pasted together for the occasion , we ought to have been able to learn more of the man and the politician , of the achievements of his Administration , and perhaps above all , more of the meaning of the legend of Camelot to the American people now . With very few exceptions , we learned nothing at all . And what we did learn was that Kennedy has not yet been placed in the American mind : that the legend of Camelot has faded , and the reality of those years has not yet been grasped . USA Today opened what Adam Walinsky called the " media extravaganza " on November 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JFK : A MONTH OF MEMORIES BEGINS , with a predictable color photograph of the young Caroline Kennedy leaning on her father 's shoulder . From then until November 23 the floodgates were open . It is not curmudgeonly to ask why so much attention was paid to this anniversary . Franklin D. Roosevelt was a far more important President . But go back to the newspapers for April 1965 : they passed over his death twenty years before . None of my researches has discovered any brooding in 1921 over the assassination of William McKinley , although the fact that he was shot in 1901 by an anarchist ought surely to have invited many conspiracy theories . ( But then one must again acknowledge the influence of television . It is unlikely that the television series " Dallas , " a drama of violence and intrigue , would have been given such a setting without the assassination ; one can not imagine a similar television series called " Buffalo , " where McKinley met his death . ) A university librarian has assured me from his own investigations that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln . Why were Kennedy 's life and death so celebrated ? One thing can be said abruptly . The fact that Kennedy was assassinated is less significant in the memory of the nation ? there have been Presidential assassinations before ? than that the assassination at once became and has remained a television drama . This crucial importance of television struck me even as the weeks of remembrance passed . I was invited to a preview of ABC 's two-hour documentary , " JFK . " After about thirty minutes during which I wondered what was surprising me , I whispered to my neighbors , including one of the senior producers of the program , " It 's all in black and white . I had forgotten how new television was then . " The black and white was accentuated by two other factors : every now and then the anchorman Peter Jennings popped up on the screen in living color ; and the pictures of J.F.K. and his time were shot in film , not videotape . Film on television has a slightly fuzzy , nostalgic , even appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the black and white had made the point . Kennedy was the first television President . A THE DAYS of celebration and appraisal passed , this was demonstrated most vividly not only by the various television programs on J.F.K. , but by the television critics in the newspapers , especially by Tom Shales , the very able TV reviewer for The Washington Post . He was a young man on November 22 , 1963 , " working for a small radio station in the Midwest , " as he told his readers , when " the U.P.I. teletype machine sounded five bells , which meant bulletin , and I watched as it noisily spat out the unthinkable . " Shales is usually very levelheaded about television . In reviewing the Kennedy programs he went off his head . Why ? Everyone I know thought that the ABC documentary was a realistic appraisal of Kennedy 's record and , given the thinness of that record , it nonetheless made every effort to award him the honor due to him . This was not enough for Shales . TARNISH IN CAMELOT was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an unseemly slur on the Kennedy memory , " an " unsavory enterprise " of " studied irreverence . " Had Shales seen the same program as I had ? I turned it on at home that night for a second look . Although it was certainly critical of the Kennedy legend , it was not only instructive but dignified . Shales wrote two more long articles on the television coverage , and in the second he revealed the reason for his prejudice against the ABC program . " Thumbsuckers that analyze Kennedy 's effectiveness as chief executive or try to determine his place in history ? like ABC 's misbegotten ' JFK ' ? are boring . Attempts to recapture through television the feel , not the facts , of the times , and the elusive incandescence of the Kennedy persona are more intriguing . " That might be the text for the whole month of remembrance . What the television critic wanted was the Presidential television image . The feel ? the persona ? not the facts . He quoted Kennedy as saying of his Administration , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even remarked that " No President came close to Kennedy as a television presence until Ronald Reagan . " Again the phrasing is telling . The television presence of a President . That was what Shales wanted , and , by and large ? his complaints notwithstanding ? that was what we got for a month , even in print . And we got it because that is exactlyhow Kennedy used television at the time . " On television in 1960 , " wrote John Corry , the television critic of The New York Times , " Mr. Kennedy was a picture of grace , " and he noted that " television news coverage expanded during the Kennedy Administration , and in large part Mr. Kennedy inspired the expansion . " In Shales 's third article he rightly demolished the NBC mini-series , " Kennedy , " memorably calling it " the latest delivery of toxic waste from NBC . " The program was indeed " trashy . . . tawdry . . . cheap pulp . " Much like Garry Wills 's book , The Kennedy Imprisonment , published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , A Hero For Our Times , it played fast and loose with unsupported rumors , with keyhole gossip and bedroom tales ; and as the books should not have been written , so should the mini-series not have been made , and not been shown . ( I like to think that in The Kennedy Promise ten years ago I showed that it is possible to criticize Kennedy and his methods severely without denying that he was a man not only of honor but of public dignity in his office , a quality which we have sorely missed since then . ) But it is worth remembering about Shales both that he is a television critic , reviewing television programs about a television Presidency , and that he is of the generation which took most of its image of Kennedy from television . When he writes of " a slain and fondly remembered President and his wife , " and speaks of the NBC mini-series as " like part of a plot to take whatever remaining heroes we have away from us , " he is writing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO PBS , which broadcast highlights from J.F.K. 's celebrated news conferences at the same time as the final episode of " Kennedy , " one could switch from the travesty to the reality : to the reality , at any rate , of the image which Kennedy was able to project on television . It was impossible not to be attracted again by the appearance of the man , to enjoy the nimbleness of the wit , the charm of his gaiety , and even to reflect that , for all the lengthy briefings with which he was prepared for these appearances , he displayed on his feet an intelligence which was wholly individual , and had to invite from all but the most skeptical a measure of trust and reassurance . The criticisms which I made in 1973 of his use of these occasions still stand . He was not only cunningly evasive , but often devious , and he sometimes blatantly lied , not least over the United States involvement in Vietnam . But today I would shift more of my criticism against the press than against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how could so youthful and vigorous a man not seize the opportunities it offered ? ? the American press just as certainly had a love affair with him . Some journalists of that time were honest enough to admit this in the past month . Bearing in mind the amiability with which Reagan is now treated by most of the White House press correspondents , it needs to be said that even print journalists enjoy covering a television President . The more and better he uses television , the more stories about the President are demanded . As one could sense all through the Kennedy press conferences , reporters were delighted to be part of such a class performance . They were eager to play the straight men to so winning a leading actor . There was a willing suspension of disbelief . The Presidential television presence is at the core of the question of " style " versus " substance " around which any debate about Kennedy revolves . It was raised again and again in the appraisals of the past month , but generally to be evaded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most often evaded by talking of the " promise . " In an editorial on November 22 , The Washington Post conjured with the word : A whole class of people , many of them of the generation whose fondest promise he was held to embody . . . . That John Kennedy had great promise is indisputable . . . . True , there is a less flattering way to put it : much of his vaunted promise arose from the fact that he died before he was called upon to make full delivery . . . . We are , however , a nation that prides itself on its promise . The word " promise " here slides from association to association until it is robbed of all meaning . What indeed was " the fondest promise " of the generation which he seemed to embody ? It could have been anything from the promise of strength and adventure ( the almost martial tone of the Inaugural Address ) to the promise of negotiation and peace ( the much-quoted speech in 1963 at American University in Washington ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , much like any politician , and contrasting them with his actual performance . If that were the case , there would be little to be said . He might , in the end , have delivered , if he had lived . We can never know . Instead , the " promise " was represented in " the legacy " which he was said to " embody , " all terms which seem popular for their haziness , and which people apparently found hard to avoid . Strip to the bone most of what was written and said , and all that was really meant by the word " promise " was that Kennedy raised a people 's expectations of what could be achieved through politics . My task here is not to try to define these intangible hopes but to understand how they were raised . And this returns us to the phenomenon of the television President . On the screen the impact of the man and his family and his circle was direct and immediate and so far unrivaled . He was the first politician in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena . He did not teach the activists and militants and demonstrators with whom we are now familiar that they must play to the cameras . But he was the first to demonstrate beyond dispute that there was a new stage . As even the mobs outside the American Embassy in Tehran knew four years ago , television is a medium which can be commanded to put on any show with a spice of drama . I stick to my criticism of ten years ago that , by raising the expectations of politics to such height , Kennedy agitated the political atmosphere , overdramatized what actually goes on in the political arena , and contributed to the disillusionment which followed when the expectations were not fulfilled . But the essential point is that he managed it through television , and one of the few new illuminations provided by the month of remembrance was that television is viewed differently by different generations , and the " promise " or " legacy " or " legend " of Kennedy is viewed differently by them as well . The generations , separated now by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kennedy than to any other President . 0 THOSE who were old enough , the television memories are ineradicable , even their memories of the assassination . The assassination was thus a wholly fitting climax to a television drama . That was where most people saw the assassination : the long motorcade , the smiling President and the waving First Lady , the rush to the hospital , the return flight on Air Force One , the funeral . But . those too young to have these memories have grown up with television . They do not quite believe anything they see on it . No audience of students has ever applauded me more uproariously than when , from my own experience of doing television documentaries in Britain , I remarked to a few hundred of them : " If it was on television , it did n't happen . " In the past month I could sense from many of those of high school or college age today that they did not really believe the Kennedy story even as they watched it on the screen . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glittered when he lived , " Arthur Schlesinger Jr . wrote a few weeks ago in THE NEW REPUBLIC . If he did , he glittered most on television . But no President is going to glitter on television to a generation that was first propped in front of the box at the age of three months . I would even suggest that a television Presidency will be automatically distrusted by them . But this only returns us to the question of what the television Presidency signifies , of what is telling in the fact that Kennedy was the first President fully to exploit the new medium . Tom Shales makes the leap from Kennedy to Reagan as two television Presidents : Kennedy 's was an Administration that was also a TV series ; Reagan 's often seems a TV series that is also an Administration . Kennedy thrived in a situation that exploited his quick wit and charm ; Reagan , slower of wit , prefers choreographed press conferences . Kennedy was heavily briefed ; Reagan is heavily coached . Kennedy took to television more or less instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes on to make the point that both of them " owe something of their political fortunes " to their performances in television debates against opponents who were much more " maladroit at utilizing the medium . " This is all just . But the television Presidency is much more than a matter of the televised debates and press conferences and addresses which a President can give . Television has altered the entire nature of Presidential campaigns ? even dictating the character and timing of the events which are held to be crucial ? and has also altered the character of Presidential leadership . The extraordinary impact on public opinion of Reagan 's defense of the Grenada invasion is not an encouraging omen . Yet this is exactly how Kennedy used television . It is a medium which magnifies the already considerable opportunities for a President to appeal over the heads of Congress directly to the people . This was my central criticism of the Kennedy method . He liked to bypass the political process ? Congress and the bureaucracy ? by reaching to the public directly . What needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations to the celebration of Kennedy 's life and Presidency is : what happens now , when a generation that disbelieves what it sees on television and so will automatically disbelieve a television President , is about to enter the political arena ? Did John F. Kennedy exist ? No young person watching television last month seemed quite convinced . That was perhaps the most provocative revelation of all . This generation has lived under no President who has shown any sign of growth in office . During its lifetime the American electorate and the American political system have not performed well in the selection of Presidents . Why should young people believe or hope ? And if we look for the main reason why the political process has performed so poorly , the answer will again be found in the very medium which they by nature disbelieve . They see their Presidents chosen by and their country governed through television . They have seen the world through television since they were tots , and seen through all its ruses , and that is why the Kennedy legend does not persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
