Cutting loans for poor nations <P> The U.S. reputation for international openhandedness has faded a bit more . <P> At a rancorous three-day meeting in Washington earlier this month , the World Bank 's 33 wealthiest member nations agreed to donate only $9 billion over the next three years to the International Development Association ( IDA ) , an agency of the bank that makes interest-free loans to more than 40 of the world 's poorest nations . The amount , which represents a reduction of 25% from 1983 levels , is $7 billion less than the $16 billion requested by the bank 's management . <P> Most donor nations supported a $12 billion compromise budget , but it fell through because the Reagan Administration trimmed the annual U.S. contribution from nearly $1 billion to $750 million . The other members were then left with a hard choice : increase their own donations to get the total up to $12 billion , which would have dropped the U.S. share below 25% , violating an informal agreement reached last year , or lower the budget total to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations decided it was more important , as a matter of precedent , to keep the U.S. shouldering a quarter of the burden , and so they lowered their contributions accordingly . <P> President Reagan settled on the $750 million figure in early December , over the objections of Secretary of State George Shultz , who advocated a $950 million annual contribution . Reagan cited congressional reluctance to contribute more than $750 million a year . But his rationale did not mollify World Bank President A.W Clausen , an American . Said he : " I 've always believed the President of the U.S. <P> can get anything he really wants . " <P> Shortly after Reagan took office , the U.S. Treasury Department conducted a study of multilateral lending institutions . <P> The report challenged criticism that the IDA was , as Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma had put it , " a giant worldwide welfare program . " But it nonetheless recommended that the U.S. <P> cut back on its IDA contributions . If credit-worthy beneficiaries like India ( which now gets one-third of the IDA 'S largesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subsidized interest rates , according to the report , the poorer countries could receive higher levels of aid . To qualify for the grants , which , technically , must be repaid within 50 years , a country must have a per capita income of less than $800 . <P> The cutback drew fire both internationally and at home . Said Sven Burmester , a World Bank expert on sub-Sahara Africa : " This means that people will starve . " Declared C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Institute for International Economics , a Washington-based think tank : <P> " It is shortsighted in terms of the United States ' own economic interests and the world economy .
