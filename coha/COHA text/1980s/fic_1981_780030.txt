 | gentleness and allowed him to drive strongly into her unresisting body . Sunlight fell in slanting yellow bars across the room , and silver dust motes danced . She lay for a long time , aware only that her eyes were open , and then finally she realized it was morning . Her head ached . Brian lay beside her , his back turned , his deep breathing very loud in the quiet chamber . Deirdre moved her legs a little and felt something warm and sticky ; when she tried to sit up a slight soreness told her the rest of the story . It was done , then ; the marriage was consummated . But why could she remember so little about it ? Last night was a blue haze , and someone dancing , and someone else ? Brian ? ? cradling her in his arms . Was it possible that her fear had washed away the memory of it ? Surely Brian would not have taken advantage of her if she had not allowed it , but how could that be ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hammer in her chest . The fear was back . She wanted , more than anything to leap out of bed and put as much distance as possible between them . Yet how could she do that now ? His shoulder loomed in her vision . He must have felt her move , for the easy rhythm of his breathing was broken and after a time he rolled over and lay facing her , his eyes open and very clear . He said nothing , just studied her face , and in the morning light there was a guarded quality to his expression that had never before been there when he looked at her . " I wish you joy in the morning , my lord , " she said shyly , puffing the blankets into bunches with her nervous hands and unconsciously building them into a barricade between his body and hers . " And I to you , " he replied with gravity . " Did you sleep well ? " " Yes , I think so . I do n't really remember . My head aches this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wine ? " " Do n't you know ? " he asked . It seemed as though he was asking something else .  | " No . " Her face was innocent , wounded , fearful beyond his power to reassure . How could he ask her outright if she had been a virgin ? How could he be certain she was n't , he who knew so little about women ? To use a Druid 's compound to make her calm , then seduce her , and then have the nerve to question her virtue  --  No ! That was more than he would allow himself . " I love you , wife , " he said gently . The pale oval of her face broke apart as if she would cry , the features rearranging themselves in a swift succession of expressions . " Oh , Brian , last night ... I mean , did you ? Did we . . . ? " He continued to smile at her . " We did . You remember nothing ? " She shook her head . " Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a head for it . After this I shall only drink mead and water . " But if you say it happened I believe you ; I know you would never deceive me . " Her eyes were shadowed , smudged in their sockets . I have violated a child , he thought . And she lies there looking at me with such determination to trust ! An unreasonable resentment took hold of him . " It 's true , " he told her in a firm , deep voice . " Last night we became man and wife fully , under the Law ; the marriage is consummated to the final degree . If you do n't remember anything about it I 'm sorry , for I tried to make the experience as beautiful for you as I could . " There , let her feel a little guilty , too ! " Oh , my lord , I 'm so sorry ! " The huge eyes glittered with the threat of tears . " But there will be other times , now that ... I mean , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next lime I shall be less afraid . And I 'll remember . " She studied his face with its new , shuttered look , and realized that the time had passed forever when she might have told him . Once , when he was open to her and adoring , it might have been possible for her to tell him her dreadful secret , under just the right circumstances , but now their bodies  | had come together and she felt their souls had moved further apart . It could not be that he had discovered her lack of virginity , for undoubtedly he would have made an issue of it immediately , not lain there smiling at her . So something else had happened , something she could not even guess , one of the complicated things that went on beneath the surface of men and women ; she imagined a vast multilayered structure of emotion and reaction with which she had no experience , and for which she lacked the emotional strength . The magical thread that had brought Brian to her along a highway of dreams had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , and the effort to reweave the torn fabric of her life was more than she could ever undertake . Let it go , she thought , let it go . Everything hurts too much and frightens me . I will just by to be a good wife to him , and make him happy in whatever ways I can , my sufferings I will keep to myself . They smiled at each other in their marriage bed . And all the unspoken words piled up between them to make a wall infinitely higher than Deirdre 's pitiful little barrier of blankets . The wheel of the seasons turned , and turned . Lupin and stock and honeysuckle bloomed their time and faded away ; the great loughs brooded serene , reflecting summer skies ; the turnstone birds pottered about on the shore , then swerved out over the water in crescent flight , their wings a-glint with chevrons of silver feathers . Limestone crumbled and sank into the mother earth ; manding ivy spread its caress over ruins abandoned before Christ was born . Life was given and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Even as the year died , something new was gathering strength in the land .  | Olaf Cuaran , king of Dublin , was about to become a father . He paced restlessly outside the chamber where his young wife lay , listening to her occasional moans and trying to judge them in relation to the sounds of the wounded on a battlefield . Other women shrieked and screamed ; he had been told that childbirth was worse than an ax-wound , but his Irish princess cried out only once . Her courage was the equal of her beauty , then  --  and of her temper . From a woman like that a man could expect a fine boy . The midwife came smiling to the door , holding in her arms a bundle that mewled and squalled . " Lochlann and Ireland have produced a son ! " she beamed . Olaf looked down at the tiny wrinkled face , red and sour , a small fist jammed against its open mouth . Its cries of outrage were out of all proportion to its size . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the baby in his arms , but the woman swung away with it . " Your wife has asked that a priest bless her infant , " she told Olaf . He scowled . " I thought she had forgotten all about that nonsense . " " Well , she has n't . " The midwife smiled at him and winked conspiratorially . " A little oil on his forehead wo n't make a Christ man out of a male child born to go viking  --  not with his father to guide him . " Olaf winked back at her . " That 's the truth , " he agreed . " There 's no harm in giving in to a female 's whim this once , I suppose . " With another pleased look at his son he turned and went into the bedchamber to congratulate the mother .  | The midwife squinted at his retreating back . " This once , " she said under her breath . " As if that red-haired demon in there would ever be satisfied with having her way just once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timbered wall , trying to be comfortable inside his chainmail tunic . " I never thought I 'd see the day an Irish girl would make a wagtail puppy out of a Norseman . " The guard rolled his eyes . " I never thought I 'd see any girl like that one , Irish or otherwise . She 's . . . " he searched his vocabulary for a word to fit Olaf 's bride , then shrugged in defeat . The midwife laughed . " Aye , she is ! " she agreed . In the small , dank bedchamber , heavy with the smells of smoke and blood and damp wood , Olaf stood gazing down at his wife . Gormlaith looked up at him with green eyes that blazed with life , her face untouched by the ordeal of childbirth save for a faint softening of weariness . The bed about her head and shoulders seemed to be covered by a rippling sea of dark red flame . " Your hair is wet , " he heard himself say inanely . She laughed . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fatherhood and Norse power and all of that nonsense , and , as usual , the sight of her had broken his train of thought . What did he know of real power ? She took a deep breath and arched her back , ignoring the stab of pain it caused in her pelvic region , and saw his gaze slide helplessly down her throat to her upthrust breasts , swollen for the baby . " I 'm wet all over , " she said in her husky voice . Olaf stared at her . What other woman would have the audacity to be seductive while she lay in childbed ? He had bartered for the girl with her father , a prince of Leinster , as a move to improve his position with the Irish surrounding Dublin , and her beauty had come as an extra gift . But since their marriage she had not only grown more beautiful with her ripening ; she had proved to be a lusty , eager bedmate , with an added flair of drama and imagination that must have come from her Celtic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king . Yet  | there were moments when she made him doubt in his secret heart if he were king enough  --  or man enough  --  for her . " Do I get a birth-boon ? " she asked him . He made himself look up from her breasts . ( So full , so round , the blue veins beneath the soft flesh ... ) " You 've already had it , Gormlaith , " he told her . " Our son is with your Christian priest right now , being blessed or some such . " " Oh , I do n't mean that . That was part of our marriage contract anyway ; you had to agree to it before my father would sign . Have you forgotten what you promised me ? " " Forgotten what ? " She reached out her hand and trailed her fingers down his thigh , letting her nails scratch lightly through the wool of his trousers . " You great bear , you have forgotten . You promised me that if I bore you a healthy son you would share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said that ? he wondered . But who knows what a man will say when the rutting-madness is on him ; still , it 's hard to believe I made such a rash statement . " Aaahhh , my dear , why do you want to trouble your head with such matters ? Surely you have enough to keep you occupied now , with a new baby as well as your other duties . " Her lower lip thrust out beyond the upper in a practiced pout . She never looked less childish than at such a moment , but the very perversity of her expression excited him . As she knew . " You promised , " she said again , her voice low in her throat . " I need things to think about , Olaf , not just all the dreary routine of women . I find myself rummaging around in my mind for something interesting to keep me from being bored . You would n't want me to be bored , would you ? When you 're busy elsewhere ? " Olaf gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with motherhood alone , as his previous wives had been . But then , she was nothing like his other women , anyway . Maybe it would help to get her involved in some of his affairs minor things , of course . " Are you certain this is what you want , Gormlaith ? " Her eyes blazed at him . Why was n't she weak , like other  | emales at such a time ? " Absolutely , " she told him firmly . And I can do it , too . Among my people , women have always field rank and positions of power . Some of the greatest inter ) reters of the Brehon Law have been women , and we own ) ur own property and are free to engage in trade . Indeed , it Alas less than three centuries ago that women were exempted : rom warfare at the Synod of Tara . I 'm sorry about that ; I ; hould have enjoyed carrying a sword . " Olaf had been surprised on more than one occasion by her mowledge of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glories of the past as an escape from their de:aying civilization in the present , but to find such an interest n a mere woman baffled him . Her mind was like a voracious animal , ceaselessly hunting . Best to throw some bone to it before it turned on him . " Very well , Gormlaith you can sit in council with me if you ) promise to say nothing ; and if you are truly interested I will have someone explain our trade situation to you , and our holdings across the sea in Northumbria . But you must give , rourself a chance to regain your full strength first . " " I 've never lost it , " she murmured . He thought she was probably overtaxing her abilities in orier to show off for him . He would quiet her with a tidbit now ) r she would never rest and his son 's milk would be unhealthy . " You might think on this , woman , " he offered . " One hf your so-called under-kings , a young fool named Malachi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked an anchorage of ours in the Boyne River and burned our ships to the waterline , as well as stealing a fine cargo of furs . " The situation must be handled carefully , as we have too many of our men in the Saxon land right now to be able to afford a major confrontation with Meath , but I have to get those furs back . I 've already sold them for a sizable amount of Irish gold to my cousin at Waterford . When you want something to occupy your thoughts , think on how I can recover my property without stirring up a hornet 's nest in Meath or Waterford . " He had hardly reached the door when she called after him ,  | " Tomorrow , send me someone who can tell me all about Malachi ! " He checked in midstride . The woman never let up ! When he was out of her immediate range her allure lost a little of its potency , and his physical reaction to her changed to a vague unease . She was like a turbulence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come howling to rip your sail from its mast . He turned back to face her , determined to regain the feeling of superiority she consistently undermined . " Who could possibly explain the character of an Irishman , Gormlaith ? " he asked with deliberate contempt . He left her then , glad to be out of the fetid chamber , eager for open air . He left the timbered hall which served as the Norse king 's palace in Dublin and walked across the courtyard toward the high wooden palisade . In the watchtowers at each corner guards stood , their eyes forever scanning the green countryside , alert to the increasing threat of the discontented Irish . Brian strode briskly after the hurrying page and tried to control his annoyance . These spells of Deirdre 's were becoming more frequent ; it was almost as if she timed them to coincide with his most urgent business , such as the planning of a company of warriors on horseback to augment the traditional Celtic foot soldier . The campaign against the foreigners had begun to bear fruit , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of Ivar 's first falterings ; there was no time to be wasted on distractions . The page led him past the clustered buildings of Cashel to  | : hat chamber known as the grianan . The sunny room was ailed with the scent of flowers and the sound of sobbing . Fithir 's ladies stood about , rolling their eyes and wringing : heir hands . The grianan had been shuttered to keep out the insistent rain , but was brightly lit for sewing ; even the corner where Deirdre crouched was free of shadows . She was huddled on the floor , beating her open palms in a meaningless rhythm on her bent knees and crying with painful dry sobs . Fithir knelt helplessly beside her , patting at the girl 's trembling shoulders . She looked up in relief as Brian ? entered . He went immediately to his wife and bent over her . " What : aused it this time ? " he asked the room at large . Fithir could only shake her head . It was Una the maidservant who answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ladies were all sewing , and she seemed to be in a : heerful humor ; I thought she was all right . Then the first thing I noticed , she had bowed her head and there were tear stains on the cloth . I tried to say something to her , but she pulled away and hit out at me as if I were a stranger . Me ! Who has looked after her since she was a mite of a thing ! " " She would n't let anyone get near her , Brian , " Fithir said then . " She called us such vile names , and she accused us all of things ... I ca n't tell you ... " " You do n't have to , " Brian interrupted her . " I 've heard her before . This happened not a fortnight ago , and when it passed she had no memory of it at all . " Fithir looked pleadingly around the room . " You must n't hold it against her , " she implored them all . " She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside to give Brian room , and he scooped one arm under Deirdre 's slight body and lifted her effortlessly . As he did , her sobs turned to shrieks and she rocked violently in his arms , trying to hit his face with her fists . Walking carefully , head turned aside to dodge her blows , he made his way from the room . Fithir stood staring after them . " Maybe it 's just the baby , " the said , in a voice that lacked conviction . " Maybe once it 's born , she 'll be herself again . " o The jar was empty . Had been for weeks , while Brian resisted , with all the iron in him , the desire to ride down to the herbalist 's cottage and have it refilled just once more . The calming potion of Fiona 's seemed to have been a blessing , but the price asked for it was beginning to weigh heavily on his conscience . He turned the container upside down and shook it over his palm , but not even a drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face hidden in the crook of her arm . The rage had passed as quickly as it came , leaving only the misery she seemed unable to shake off . If only there were just a few drops of the Druid 's medicine , to give her an hour 's rest ! The elixir had done her much good ; everyone had commented on how relaxed and happy she had been , while it lasted . Fithir had said to him then , " Marriage to you seems to have been good for my sister . " No one had known that Deirdre lay like a log beneath him in their bed , allowing him to perform what had come to be a solitary and joyless act while she suffered him in silence . Yet that was obviously her best effort , requiring all the will power she possessed , and Brian could not bring himself to criticize her . " Brian ? " She had lifted her head and was staring at him with a pained intensity . Sweat beaded on her forehead and upper lip , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned toward her warily , half expecting a renewed attack of invective and fury . " Are you all right ? " " I . . . yes , I think so . I did n't mean ... I do n't know what came over me . They should n't have sent for you , I know they must have called you away from something important . Can you forgive me  --  again ? " Her eyes were contrite , big with pleading . " Of course , it 's no matter . If you 're certain you 're all right now I 'll send your maid in to you and see you later in the evening . Try to get some rest . " He brushed her clammy skin  | with his lips and rose , thankfully , to go , but a whispered voice  --  that might have been imagined  --  hissed at his back : " Coward ! " Brian froze . The relief drained from him , and he turned slowly to face her . " Did you say something ? " She came alive then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into a tense crouch on the bed , her face contorted with an expression of disgust that made her almost ugly . " Yes , you ! You 're a coward , all men are cowards , always attacking the weak ! But you want to run away now , do n't you ? You want to run away and leave me like this ! " He started toward her , wishing he could face a sword instead . " That is n't true , " he lied . " I really want to help you , but you wo n't let me , you keep working yourself into these fits and it all seems so senseless ... " " Senseless to you , but necessary for me ! It 's as if I have this great boiling inside me and I ca n't go into battle or hit at somebody to work it off . So this is my battleground , and I have to do all my fighting alone because you 're afraid to stand with me . " She was slipping beyond his grasp . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some dark place he could not find . " It 's not necessary for you to do this to yourself , Deirdre , " he began , trying to communicate with the gentle mind trapped behind the glaring eyes . Just tell me what you 're fighting and of course I 'll stand with you , but I ca n't combat shadows that have no names . " " Shadows ... , " she said , her voice trailing away . " These spells of yours are driving us apart , " he began again , " and I would give anything to have it otherwise . I ca n't help believing you could control yourself if you would only try ! I have so many other situations to deal with right now , I ca n't function if I have to fight you and the Northmen too . Just tell me what 's doing this to you ! " She slumped back on the bed and shook her head , very slowly , from side to side , her eyes never leaving his face . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid of  | almost everything , and I do n't even know why ; I do n't think I used to be like that . " She began to cry again , softly and without hope . She made a mighty effort to block out the dizzying surge of feelings that threatened to sweep her away . It would be so easy to give up to them , to submit and let herself be carried into that gray world that smelled of roses and sounded like the sea , where nothing was real and when she reached out she felt only the swirling fog . But she might never get back to Brian . This time , he might not come for her . She clenched her hands into fists until her nails broke through the skin of her palms , but she did not notice . She saw only his worried eyes , and tried with all her worn strength to win him as her ally . " Do n't hate me , Brian , " she whispered . " I need you so much ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop him and he saw the shocking half-crescents , oozing red . " You look at me with pity now , instead of love , and I suppose I ca n't blame you for that . But I do blame you for leaving me when I need you most , running off to drill your soldiers or fight your battles or make speeches to get more men ; all those things are more important to you than I am . " You put such a value on bravery , and you talk in the hall of saving the land from the foreigners , but you are n't brave enough to stay with me when the shadows close in . You sit beside me until you have fulfilled some imaginary degree of obligation and then you hurry off , and I see the look of relief on your face as you go . If only you 'd stay with me just once , all the way , go all the way to the bottom with me and help me come out in some safe place on the other side ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be shared , a contagion she would infect him with in the name of love . " You want me to be like you , out of control ? " he asked , revolted . She shook her head , with the damp ringlets clinging to it . " No , of course not . I only want you to stay to the end . For once . The bitter , bitter end . " Her voice was heavy and tired . " And what good would that do , Deirdre ? " he asked . He  | truly wanted to know , but even as he framed the question he saw there would be no answer . She had left him ; her eyes were blank and empty , everything drained out and replaced by a depth of exhaustion even he could not imagine . All for nothing ! he thought . She sat there , miserable and alone , her delicate beauty disfigured , her mind shut away , and what had been accomplished ? . Yet that which made no sense to him obviously had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost understood it , and as he watched her he felt a deep regret that the kernel of it had escaped him , perhaps forever . When he was gone , Una hurried to wrap Deirdre in blankets and make her comfortable in the bed . The tears were trickling down Deirdre 's cheeks again , but this time she cried without sound , as people do when they are truly alone . He ordered a horse bridled for him and vaulted onto its back , shouting as he did so for the fortress gates to be opened . He rode at a dangerous gallop down the road from the Rock , his face set in grim lines . When he reached the small cluster of cottages which included Fiona 's , he yanked his mount back on its haunches and stared at the little empty house , its door sagging ajar , all sign of human habitation gone . A stray dog came and peered at him around the door frame , then ducked back inside . Fiona would never tolerate a dog in her house ; they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went inside and saw the bare shelves , the cold hearth , the two empty pegs where her clothing had hung . It was as if she had never been there . The lathered horse plunged up the Rock again , Brian kicking it without mercy every step of the way . He strode into their chamber , not looking at Deirdre . He pawed through his small assortment of personal possessions , his comb-bag and hand mirror , his box of flints , his knives and scissors and salves , until he found the other jar . The one he had never opened . The one Fiona said was an aphrodisiac . With trembling hands he broke the seal and poured its  | contents into a wooden cup . Pale , straw-colored liquid , with a faint smell not quite like honey . He tossed the liquid into the night jar , then threw the wooden cup after it . He stood for a moment , thinking , then carried it , jar and all , to the blazing hearth and pitched the contents into the fire . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no way of knowing if Fiona 's calming potion had damaged Deirdre in some way , possibly contributed to those attacks of irrationality . There was no one he trusted enough to ask , no one to whom he was willing to confess his possible complicity . Perhaps the medicaments were just what Fiona claimed . . . but if so , why had she fled without a word ? And if they were some subtle poison , why had she waited so long to flee ? ChapteR 20 They were seeking out the Northmen in earnest . Wherever the Norse or Danes strayed too far from the port cities , there they were likely to encounter a company of well-armed and well-trained Munstermen . The old overland routes from limerick to Cork and Waterford were all but closed off to Ivar 's merchants and the Irish who trafficked with them . Even their highways , the rivers , were no longer safe ; and the Munstermen began assembling a rudimentary naval force to patrol the southern coastal waters . Brian 's new light cavalry , mounted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering bands of Norse-Irish outlaws that had ravaged the province for generations . The Northmen had encountered armed resistance before , but never such an organized campaign . With every week that passed more warriors came to Cashel to join the army , and if  | they found Brian 's endless drilling and iron-fisted discipline alien to their natures , they bore it anyway for the obvious success it brought . Other Munstermen , furious with the drying-up of their lucrative trade arrangements with the Northmen , threw in their lots with Ivan . There were problems . Mahon was popular with his officers , many of whom had served under him since the first incursion into south Munster with Cennedi . His thought patterns were similar to theirs ; his orders could be anticipated . But Brian was like lightning . When they least expected him he appeared , checking on some small and seemingly insignificant detail of planning or equipment , or making a speech to the foot soldiers without even bothering to discuss it first with the officer in command . Aggrieved captains began complaining to Olan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving instruction in the javelin today to a bunch of new recruits ! He wants to do everything himself ; he wo n't delegate authority or listen to the opinion of older , wiser heads . " " He has books in his tent , manuscripts and charts of wars fought centuries ago , and he insists that we should learn from them . He gives lectures on the campaigns of men called Alexander and Caesar and is forever drawing diagrams and pegging them up on trees for the men to study . We 've never done it that way before ! " " Your brother simply refuses to accept the established chain of command , " Olan said flatly to Mahon . The old soldier 's chapped complexion was more ruddy than ever , his eyes deeply sunken in pouches of flesh . " I grant you , he 's an inspired fighter , but he has radical ideas . " You and I have been together many years , my lord ; you know I 'm not an unreasonable man . But I 've forgotten more of the skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . " Mahon tried to placate his friend . " No doubt , no doubt , but you must admit that his is the impetus behind this effort . I 'm sure the time will come when he will turn to you for ad-  | vice , but until then , try to keep harmony among the officers , wo n't you ? If it were not for Brian 's vision and the force of his will , you and I would still be raising cows in Thomond . " Olan 's beetling brows drew together over the bridge of his nose . " Aye , and we might be a damned sight better off , " he said gruffly . " I 'm not one to say doom , but there are moments I fear we may be getting into very deep waters . " " Do n't tell my brother ! " Mahon said with a laugh . " He 'll march you all to the bank of the Suir and give you swimming lessons ! " In private , he worried about the growing divisiveness . Fithir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing out the irritating thorn . The good widow seemed to have a gift for diminishing his worries ; she was always an attentive listener , and her placid nature made him think of a snug harbor into which a small boat might sail in time of storm . Their wedding day was announced to coincide with harvest time ; a man could happily look forward to a cold winter spent with such a warm wife . " The officers are jealous of Brian , " he told Fithir as they shared a mead cup while bees droned in the lady-garden . " The men seem devoted to him , but the captains quarrel among themselves about his policies . Very definite factions are forming that could split the army . " Fithir 's eyes were kind , unalarmed . " My dear , it is the nature of our people to be contentious ; Connacht argues with Meath , Leinster feuds with Munster  --  but all men will respond to your brother 's golden tongue and vision of unity , you will see . When the time comes , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , moss of a color that might be the distilled essence of green spread over the gray stones . Military problems seemed distant , abstract ; his more immediate thoughts centered about the dimple that winked in and out in Fithir 's cheek . " I wish I could be certain , " he said , anticipating the comforting way her head nestled against his arm . " You do n't think they would refuse to follow him ? "  | " This army has never faced a really sizable army of the foreigners in battle . So far , my brother has managed to keep our campaigns at the level he knows best : skirmish , surprise attack . But the day is coming when Ivar will pit all his strength against us , and without the unhesitating support of our officers we could be in serious trouble . " " God will be with you , " Fithir told him with the strong assurance she felt that he was seeking . Grateful , he put his arm around her and hugged her to him . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The private ear into which you can pour the worries that would otherwise sour in your belly and make you sick . How lucky I am , in this woman. / " Speak to your brother , " Fithir advised him . " Make him understand how important it is that he secure the allegiance of your officers . You 're a very persuasive man yourself , you know . " She smiled up at him and Mahon felt larger and warmer than he had minutes before . " If you explain it to him I 'm certain he will listen to you . " Mahon sought out Brian in the latter 's tent at the base camp . Brian spent much of his time there now ; his only certain appearances on the Rock were on the Lord 's Day and when Deirdre herself requested to see him . The last months of pregnancy had had a soothing effect on her ; the spells of hysteria had abated , and she seemed content to spend her days alone with her maid , drowsing in her chamber or drifting through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of oiled hides . It smelled in the sun , but it turned the rain and kept his books and papers dry ; he noticed the way Mahon 's nose wrinkled in distate , however , so he bowed his brother out and sent for stools to be set up beneath a tree . There must be a way of saying this without touching a spark to his temper , Mahon thought . " Since you assumed your share of the command , we have been very fortunate in our forays against the Northmen , " he said to Brian , " and I feel we have come to be a power to be reckoned with . " Brian said nothing . He waited , watching his brother  | closely . To move or make a gesture was to give away part of yourself ; if you remained immobile the other person would reveal his inner feelings to you without being aware of it . Mahon , for example , had begun to pick at the cuticle of his nails . He was nervous , then ; the outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mahon cleared his throat . " I am aware that you have formed a close personal bond between yourself and the common soldiers , " he said carefully , " and I can see the advantage to that . " " It was the custom of Julius Caesar , " Brian replied . " Yes , well , I 'm certain it 's a wise idea , when possible . But do n't you think it would be equally wise to form the same ties of friendship between yourself and my officers ? " Brian sat a little straighter . " I have n't been unfriendly to them ; I make the same effort to treat them with courtesy as they do to me . " Mahon picked more diligently at his nails . They seemed to occupy his full attention ; he did not look at Brian as he replied . " I am speaking of friendship , Brian . " Brian 's gray eyes were disdainful . " Friendship is a matter of policy , brother . I wo n't waste training time entertaining officers at Cashel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife to endure the company of their gossiping wives . I give them the best effort that is in me , as I do to every man , and that should be enough . " Mahon looked up then . With a mighty effort he brought the weight of the kingship into his voice , and noticed that Brian did not react to it at all . " I must tell you frankly , brother , that you have alienated some of the senior officers , and unless you make a serious effort to win their unquestioned support we might not be able to count on them on the battlefield . " Brian 's lower lids tightened , narrowing his eyes to gray slits . " They want me to continue to fight by the old methods , because they themselves are afraid of change . " " And you , Brian  --  are you afraid of conciliation and com-promise ? "  | " The time for conciliation is when you have the upper hand , Mahon , not when you 're crushed beneath an invader 's heel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . " You have a long way to go before you understand the skills of the diplomat , little brother . " " When I need them , I 'll learn them , " Brian answered . " Right now all my effort is given toward learning how to win . " Friendship , Brian thought . Mahon always extols the soft virtues . I would rather have their respect than their friendship , and respect can not be won by putting my arm around some grizzled captain 's shoulder and listening to his war stories . He sat on a stool in front of his tent , patiently working tallow into a strap of new leather . A few rods across the trampled and muddy earth he could see a group of officers gathered under the trees , hunched over chessboards and drinking cups while their body servants tended to the maintenance of their equipment . Brian refused to have a body servant for himself in camp . Watching the men at their games he noted that even Ardan was with them , content for once to enjoy himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like love , led to pain and loss . Sometimes in his dreams they walked away from him , Cennedi and Fiacaid and Nessa and those comrades who lay in unmarked graves in Thomond , and he watched them recede into the distance until he was all alone . The memory strayed across his mind of a night when he had lain beside Deirdre as she tossed in her nightmares . He had reached out to hold her , offering comfort ; and in her sleep she had struck out at him with her small fist , an ineffectual blow that did not hurt his shoulder but went straight to his heart . It is better to be alone , he thought . To know you are alone , and accept it . Mahon must always feel that he is loved , but I can live without that if I have to . If I must .  | I have myself , and that will have to be enough . He looked at the pastel plain , dotted with trees and rich with life ; he saw the empurpled , distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take and hold it . In the booleying time , when the cattle were moved with the change of the seasons to fresh pasture , Ivar crossed into Thomond with an army intent upon exterminating the Dal Cais in their ancestral lands . He remorselessly put to death some of those very Irish chieftains who had been allied with him through threat of force or the desire for commerce , but who protested his attack on the farmers of Thomond . Two Irish under-kings stood with him , however ; Molloy of Desmond and Donovan of Hy Carbery were delighted to vent their spleen on the Dalcassians without actually having to face Mahon 's new army . They directed Ivar and his son Harold to Boruma itself , so that once more it was burned to the ground , and they sacked the monastery at Killaloe . Excitement raced through the army camp near Cashel like a grass fire , puffing men into anxious clusters where everyone tried to talk at once , and many clenched fists were raised into the air . " That Ivar is a treacherous hound ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pasture . He will pay dearly for that ! " Mahon vowed , his voice shaking with emotion . " The time has passed when we could be content to kill them in the tens and twenties ; my brother is right , we must make war on Limerick itself , and wipe out that deadly lair from the river to the forest . " " Yea , brother ! " Brian agreed . He stood a little apart from the others , his hands knotted into fists , his jaw muscles clenched beneath the red-gold beard . " We can send to Malachi of Meath ; I suspect he would like to have a part in this , or at least send some of his fighting men to add to our own . " And you , Cullen , is n't your wife from Dungannon and a close cousin of the Hy Neill chieftains in Ulster ? Could you get support for us from the north ? " " I do n't know that we want to go that far , " Olan inter-  | jected . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never get them out again . An ally can become an enemy when his usefulness is over . " " Better Ulstermen than Northmen , " Brian replied , and Mahon supported him . The encampment became a swarm of activity within minutes , with riders galloping off by every road and trailway to carry the message of Munster 's urgent summons to the men of Ireland . Brian went to Deirdre to say his farewells . He found her lying on the bed , a wolfskin robe tucked under her chin , her eyelids closed in what appeared to be a peaceful sleep . The mound of her belly rose beneath the furs in a swelling promise . He stared at it thoughtfully , wishing he could leave without awakening her , but then her eyes fluttered open and she spoke his name . " I have to go , " he told her briefly . " The whole army is marching at dawn ; we intend to put an end to the devastation of the Northmen from Limerick once and for all . This is the opportunity I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the sound of Ivar 's name , Deirdre 's eyes opened to their fullest width and something mad crept into them . " You 're going to kill Ivar ? " she asked tensely . " And all of them  --  you 'll kill all of them ? Every one ? " Her thin fingers began to pluck at the wolfskin robe , and her eyes cast about the room like a trapped animal 's . Then they focused on Brian with a strange and terrible intensity . He tried to reassure her . " We 'll break Ivar 's strength so that he wo n't be a threat to anyone any longer . " " That 's not enough , you must kill him ! Kill him ! Kill that other one , that Northman ! " She shrieked aloud , gone suddenly wild , and struggled to sit up in bed , beating the air with her fists . " Kill him ! Kill him ! " Brian stared at her , heartsick , a dreadful possibility beginning to suggest itself to him . But then her servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him bodily out of the chamber . Even so , her cries followed him , drilling into his skull . " Kill ! Kill KILL ! '  | With the bloodstains of the Dalcassians still on their swords and axes , Ivar 's army turned toward Cashel . Their easy victory across the Shannon had made them confident , and their blood ran hot for battle . Joined by Danish mercenaries and bands of the hated Norse-Irish outlaws , they headed for the heart of Munster . The Irish marched to meet them . Almost at the last moment before departure Mahon 's troops had been cheered by the arrival of a fully armed and unexpected detachment from Delvin More , led by a famous warrior , King Cahal , come unsolicited to swell their ranks . According to his scouts ' reports , it appeared to Brian that the two vast armies would meet near the woods of Sulcoit , a level district almost midway between Cashel and Limerick . Mahon ordered the army to be encamped for the night , so that they might face Ivar with the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagrams with him , his carefully drawn battle plans spread out before him on the table in the king 's tent when the chieftains gathered to discuss the next day 's attack . As the senior officers crowded around Mahon , each clamoring for a good position for his own forces , Brian . " Please be silent and let me explain our battle order . " Their reaction was what Mahon had expected and feared . Brian 's plan was to place a phalanx of foot soldiers armed with swords , axes , and hammers directly behind the front line of javelins . His proud new cavalry would ride at the wings , joined to the main body by " hinges " composed of Ardan 's stingers , and followed by a flying column of both horse and infantry . If the broad line of the Northmen did not succeed in enveloping the Irish , the reserve columns , which would be at an angle , would be in position to wheel inward and reinforce any weak point in their own line . The plan seemed to please no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit ! " Cahal  | complained . " I can not break them up now to put them into some unfamiliar formation with strangers ! " " We will doubtless be fighting in the woods as well as in the open , " Kernac argued . " All this emphasis on mounted men is an insult to us Celts , who have always fought on foot , and besides , they 'll be quite useless in the trees . " " All these maneuvers have been practiced many times in camp , " Brian reasoned with them . " The men are thoroughly familiar with the formations , and those who are new to our ranks should have little difficulty in following the order if it is explained to them clearly in advance , by leaders they know . It is imperative that we work together as a unit here ; we are facing all the strength Ivar can bring to bear against us , and we must make no mistakes . " " Following this bizarre plan of yours would be our biggest mistake , " an unidentified voice snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes narrowed and Mahon laid a restraining hand on his arm . " Please , " the king said , " I ask you to remember that my brother has had no little success against the Northman . He knows how to make ten swords serve as a hundred , and his men love him and will fight for him to the death : " " Then let him lead them , " another hostile voice shot back . " I came willingly enough to fight with him , but I do n't intend to die using some untried technique against five thousand angry Northmen ! " Brian held his nervous hands against his sides where they could not be seen , and forced his voice to be calm and steady . " I am not offering you an untried technique , " he replied , " but a battle plan that has proven its value many times . Alexander of Greece fought thus against the Persians at Arbela , on a piece of ground much like Sulcoit , and he defeated a vast and powerful force . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander ? " they asked one another . The grumbling was ominous now , a discontent that swelled the walls of the large tent outward . With the reality of a major battle so close at hand every man sought the security of  | the familiar . It was Brian 's spirit they wanted , but not his ideas . Mahon went from one man to another , soothing , placating , urging them to give the plan a chance . Brian left the command tent and went out into the night alone to stand under the stars  --  the stars that had looked down upon Alexander , and Xenephon , and Caesar . At last the senior command officers filed from the tent , most of them refusing to look at Brian as they passed him , and then Mahon came out , slump-shouldered , to stand beside his brother . " Must you always have it your way , Brian ? " he asked . " My way is the right way ; I am sure of it . " " I hope you are right , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thank you , brother , for standing behind me in this . " " I gave you my word I would back you , and I have , Brian , but my word does not extend to such men as Cahal and the kings of the other tribes . The orders are being given now and the men are being placed for the night according to their battle formations , but there are no guarantees as to what will happen at dawn . Some of the officers may well refuse to follow you , or even me , now , and if that happens your plan will be destroyed . There is doubt and dissension in the camp tonight , and those are a soldier 's worst enemies , Brian . " " Let me speak to them in the morning , " Brian said . By the earliest dawn light he could see them , the ranks of men stretching away before him in their neat and unfamiliar geometry . Officers , mounted and on foot , waited with their companies ; some with their arms folded across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Northmen were only a mile away . There was coughing and foot shifting among the soldiers , and they rippled like pond water , leaning forward , falling back . It would be impossible for all of them to hear him , no matter how strong his voice . He rode his horse slowly to the open space in front of the line , and when he was certain most  | of them were watching , he drew his sword and held it over his head . " I am Brian of Boruma ! " he called to them , with all the power in his deep lungs . " I am one of you ! " He slid off the horse and stood before them on foot . The horse , uncertain , drifted away and he made no effort to stop it . There was a gasp in the ranks , and he turned to look behind him . A line of men had come up over the horizon , a dark metallic band that advanced steadily toward them across the plain , dividing to flow through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorable mass that was coming to crush the Irish forever . Brian turned back to face his army . The sun was just up now , its first pure light touching his face and picking out the glinting copper threads in his hair . " I am Brian of Boruma ! " he cried again , filling his lungs with the sweet morning air of Ireland . " I am going to die , but I am going to die a free man ! If you would be free also , come with me ! " He looked to the side and gave the signal to the right wing to follow him . No one moved . They stood transfixed , staring at the unbelievable numbers of the Northmen who had now come to a halt a half mile away and were drawing themselves into their battle formation . He sent his face toward the enemy , lifted his chin , and began to march forward . He did not look back to see if anyone followed . He heard nothing behind him . The Vikings waited . Sunshine struck sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They watched in eerie silence as Brian advanced alone . He heard nothing behind him . His belly was hollowed by fear . His guts cramped , anticipating the thrust of a sword . His whole body was suddenly slippery with sweat . Salt rivulets ran down his forehead and into his eyes , stinging him . In a few minutes he would die . But he had to go forward . He heard ... something ... behind him . The waiting Northmen tensed , began to move about . Brian  | could see them shifting their weapons and preparing for some sort of action . A shield wall was raised , as if that were necessary to repel one lone warrior . But Brian was no longer alone . He heard the tramp of feet behind him , the jingle of bits and the rasp of swords being drawn , the slap of leather throwing slings against open palms , the grunt as javelins were hefted and balanced , the rustle and clatter and thunder of an army at his back . An army carried forward by his courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army that was powerless to resist the tidal pull of his magnetism . An army , beginning to chant something . " Brian of Boruma ! Brian of Boruma ! " He felt them as a weight behind him , a wall at his back , a light shining over his shoulder . The fear still gnawed his vitals , but a pulse had begun to beat in his throat , stronger than the fear , stronger than wine or the desire for women . " Brian Boru ! Brian Boru ! " He raised his sword above his head , willing the sunlight to enter it and magnify its brilliance . He heard the men cheer . He heard the men following him . " Brian Boru ! Brian Boru ! " The flesh crawled on the back of his neck . A love pounded through him ; love for the mass of them , the faceless unit and the individual man , a love so deep and total he felt it transform him as he advanced . He could not be beaten now . Following him , they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exultation that made hearts race and eyes glitter . They were lifted beyond themselves into something greater , something that seemed , at that moment , immortal . " Boru ! Born ! " He had them now . They were with him like the beats of his heart . " Born ! Born ! " One body of men  --  his body . One will  --  his will . " Bore ! Born ! " The chant at his back , building . Their strength flooding  | through him , the wave of their devotion pouring over him , carrying him forward on its crest . Boru ! Bond " They went forward together into the swords , into the axes , and nothing could stop them . Nothing could defeat them . They were the Irish ; they were his men . They were Brian . " BORU ! BORU ! BORU ! " And the Northmen fell away before them like wheat from the scythe . Brian 's cavalry galloped diagonally across the rapidly closing space between the two armies , thrusting deep into the Norse left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy through which the Irish foot soldiers poured . The front line of javelins came up behind Brian on the run and went with him shoulder to shoulder into the front line of the Northmen , holding a formation almost as tight as the foreigners ' shield wall . The Northmen , surprised by a type of assault they had never experienced , milled about and were cut down by the cavalry swords and the singing flight of the spears . Brian briefly regretted losing his horse , for on foot it was not possible to sight the Norse leaders who were his principal target . But the charge of the mounted men was a flash of glory quickly past ; the weight of the battle lay with the thunderous coming together of the two main bodies , and that was where the most intense fighting took place . From his position to Brian 's left Mahon noted with relief the successful outcome of the first stage of his brother 's plan . The Norse army , bisected and confused , hit the clench jawed Irish line and almost immediately fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to match the inspired battle lust of the Celts . Every man the Northmen faced thought himself a hero and invincible for that brief space of time . Ivar 's men had come prepared to take the offensive only ; Mahon saw more than one Northman look wildly around , then whirl and begin shoving his way back through his comrades , headed for the rear . It was then Mahon heard his own voice chanting with the others , " Boru ! Boru ! Boru ! " as his sword sliced halfway through the neck of a silver-thatched Norseman who had somehow lost his helmet . The man fell with a groan strangled by bubbling blood and Mahon stepped over him and went on , still chanting . Brian was deep in a press of men , a stench of sweat , and a creak of leather . The clash of metal on metal left his ears ringing , but there was no need to hear anyway , there was only the senseless shouting and the cries of the dying . The fear was totally gone now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics of battle . Thrust and shock and forward . Dodge and slice and forward . If he was aware of any feeling at all it was a momentary objective appreciation of the neatness with which his body anticipated and sidestepped a crushing blow ; the fluid , reflexive response that laid a Northman low and went on in one stride to the next . He was still in the van , unwounded as if magically protected , but he was not thinking of death . One of the javelin carriers stepped up beside him and put the point of his weapon squarely into a Norse throat , then glanced sideways at Brian out of a sweated , blood-smeared face and grinned . " Boru ! " the man yelled at him , and Brian grinned back . Then each turned to meet his next opponent . King Cahal , proudly afoot and naked save for his saffron tunic and a magnificent yew-wood shield covered with embossed leather , was the first of the dissident leaders to realize that the tide of battle was receding toward limerick . He paused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned Dalcassian was right ; the Northmen are retreating ! " Just then a warrior burst out of an alder thicket to  | his left and directed a mighty ax blow at his shield , splitting it down the center . Cahal flung it away from him and pulled his dagger from his belt as the Norsemen closed with him . He gave one slice with his sword , then ducked under his enemy 's arm to bury the dagger in the man 's belly . The Norse who had been in the front lines were now struggling toward the rear , breasting a sea of their own comrades . Commands shouted in several languages and dialects added to their confusion ; some of them ran into a knot of the IrishNorse outlaws who slew them as cheerfully as if they had been on opposing sides , instead of all following the standard of Ivar . At the head of his Desmonians , well insulated by the first line of Norsemen , Molloy had thought to be in a good position . When discussing the battle formation with Harold the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would prefer not to be in the forefront of the fighting when the usurper goes down . I want Mahon killed , but not by my sword  --  you understand ? " Harold looked at him with some amusement . " Irish kill Irish all the time , Desmond , and did so long before my people ever came here . Why should you not be in at the death of the man who took your crown ? " " We are a vengeful people  --  not unlike yourselves , Northman . If I am nearby when Mahon falls , some of his supporters might seek me out personally later and take his blood-price from my skin . My life is a little too precious to me for that ! I intend to live long and well as the king of Munster . " So I urge you , Harold Ivarsson ; see to it that the bogus king falls in the first heat of battle , and then I and my men will support you with a good will until victory is won . " Harold shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had rather meet my enemy face to face and let him know that mine was the hand that killed him . " Molloy helped himself to some more of Harold 's ale , wiping his mouth with his forearm when the brew overflowed onto his chin . " You live too simple a life , Northman . Among my race the shifts of power are sudden and frequent ; your  | friend today may be your enemy tomorrow , a king may spring up out of the oystergrass and strip you of all your holdings in the wink of an eye . I am very careful as to which enemies I make ; I want no surviving Dalcassian to say he saw me kill his chief . " At Sulcoit that bright summer morning in the year 968 , Molloy found himself relieved of at least one of his worries  --  no man would say that his had been the hand that slew Mahon . Indeed , no ax or sword touched Mahon at all , and , as the Northmen fell back , the Irish advanced steadily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heading toward the rear , their barely controlled panic communicating itself to the Desmonians . Even Ivar , who had not taken part in the attack but was stationed on a slight rise to enjoy the spectacle of a major Irish defeat , thought better as to the wisdom of his position and began moving back toward the Limerick road . If his son failed to make a stand and hold the Munstermen , there was nothing between them and Ivar 's city on the Shannon but a small forest and too few miles of open country . Forward momentum successfully achieved , Brian was able to leave his position briefly , acquire a horse , and get an overall picture of the way the action was going . " If nothing else , my beauty , " he whispered to the rawboned gray stallion he had commandeered , " you 'll let me see with my own eyes instead of trusting the reports of others . " And it was a sight worth the seeing . The right wing , having broken all the way through the main body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectively blocking retreat . Brian sent word to his two reserve units to move up along both sides and encircle the Northmen . When they realized their situation , Harold and Donovan tried to get as many of their men into the protection of the woods as they could , but the Irish followed them relentlessly and the slaughter began in earnest . At the southern edge of the wood a company of Norsemen was making a desperate stand against the tightening noose of the Irish . Brian rode toward them , watching over the heads of  | his Munstermen as the foreigners sought in vain for some way out of the trap . He saw one burly warrior much swarthier than the usual Norse , he might have been a Dane  --  step forward just as the first Irish javelins were hurled . The armored warrior moved into the very path of one , dodged aside with the skill born of long practice , and caught the passing spear with a backhanded movement , then swung his brawny arm in a backward circle so that the spear was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on target and he nailed a hapless Irishman to the earth . " I can learn to do that , " Brian promised himself as he urged his horse forward and leaned into his sword thrust . He guided the animal with his weight and his legs , pushing through the ranks of men locked in mortal combat until he came to the dark foreigner , who had just bludgeoned a Munsterman to the earth with his interlocked fists . Brian loomed above him on the prancing horse and the Dane glanced up ; two pairs of gray eyes met . Brian swept his sword up and touched it to his forehead in a gesture of respect and saw the man 's eyes widen with astonishment ; then the weapon came down in a powerful arc that cleft the Danish skull in two and dispatched the warrior to Valhalla with one clean blow . Brian rode up and down the battle line , killing when he had the opportunity , issuing commands , and moving his men about in accordance with the detailed plan unfolding in his head . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mountain top , everything spread out before him and clearly visible , and he could locate each little pocket of resistance , direct each unit of men to the place of greatest need at the perfect time . His absolute confidence communicated itself to his followers , and they obeyed him without question ; Olan and Kernac and the other captains accepting his orders willingly now . As the sun neared its zenith , Ardan the Slinger led his command into a grove of trees in hot pursuit of fleeing backs . The blue-green shade was sudden ; the eye did not ad-  | just quickly after the brightness of midday . Ardan smelled the loamy , leaf-molded earth , and a mighty tree trunk reared up directly before him , like some legendary champion making a rear-guard defense to allow his troops to complete their escape . His vision adapted itself to the diminished light , and he saw the smooth , smoke-gray bark just in front of him , every detail wondrously clear . To his surprise , it was as if he had encountered a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way to turn . The Northman came around the other side of the tree and struck him down . Those men whom Brian had trained to fight with the ax were making great inroads on the Norse army now , swinging their weapons in wild arcs , howling with glee when the blades chopped through the foreign armor . Unlike the Northmen , the Irish held their axes one-handed , the thumb extended along the handle to guide the blow , and this seemed to unnerve their enemy most of all . Frantic , the Northmen plunged against the encircling line and began to break through , streaming back toward Limerick or into the sheltering woods . Brian galloped beside his men , urging them on though they needed no urging , feeling the ponderous mass of the Norse army disintegrate before the agile attack of the Irish . The sun was in midheaven now and Ivar 's force was in full retreat , sweeping its enraged Irish allies with it . Men lay everywhere on the grass and trampled earth , weltering in their own blood and asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reined in and turned back to seek out Mahon and issue orders for re-forming the companies , so that the most advantage could be taken of the enemy 's demoralization . He sighted Mahon 's banner , slightly torn , fluttering from a pole thrust into the same rise of ground recently occupied by Ivar and his aides . The earth was red with death and victory . Mahon was sitting on a tall brown horse , leaning over the animal 's neck as he listened to a report from one of his officers . When Brian came up he straightened , eyes alight with satisfaction .  | " It is a triumph ! " he announced . Brian surveyed the scene coolly . He saw and noted the faces turned toward him in open admiration ; a few hours ago these same chieftains had been hostile , ready to desert the king and his radical brother . Now they were gathered about Mahon 's flag to rejoice in a great victory . They cheered him as he dismounted and walked over to them . " We can not be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned to the ground , " Brian told them firmly . It was too soon to forgive and forget , too soon to enjoy defeating an enemy who could turn on them at any time and cut them down . " The Northman 's arrogance has betrayed him , " Brian said to the officers , " but he may yet find his pride and stand against us . Do n't waste your breath congratulating yourselves , for this is the time to re-form the army in a tight offensive spearhead and launch it at Limerick . " He addressed Mahon directly : " Brother , if you are still with me , we will be in Ivar 's city tonight picking Norse teeth out of the ashes . " The naked savagery in Brian 's voice was not lost on Mahon . A team of litter bearers came up just then , carrying Kernac , who lay unconscious , his leg severed below the knee , the shinbone sticking out of the pulped flesh like a splintered reed . Mahon saw Brian 's glance flick to the injured man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must take time to tend our wounded , Brian , " Mahon said gently , hoping to wipe away the hardened crust forming around his brother . He saw that Brian still vibrated with the tense pitch of battle , an unsated hunger in his eyes ; and Mahon felt a sudden strong revulsion against the lust to kill so blatantly expressed . " We have had our victory , Brian , " he reminded the younger man , leaning toward him and stressing his words . " We must care for the injured now , and let our brave warriors rest . " Brian stared at his brother . " Have you taken a head wound ? I hope so , for otherwise the sun has addled your brains ! More than one battle has been lost because the victors failed to follow up their advantage , and I ca n't allow that to happen here ! " As for the wounded ... " he paused and gazed out over  | the field . " Wounded men take so much time . Someone must bind up their wounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cashel ... if we had some way they could be treated here by a company of nonwarriors . . . " Mahon interrupted him impatiently . " We can take care of them here , now , as we always have . These are our friends and comrades , Brian ! " " And they have taken their injuries in an effort to destroy Ivar , " Brian shot back . " If we let Ivar get away and regroup to fall on us later , their pain will have been wasted . We have had a similar discussion before , brother , and I feel just as strongly about it now . We must finish what we began ! " The Irish chieftains had listened to this exchange without contributing to it , their eyes flicking from one man to the other ; but at the end they were nodding in agreement with Brian . Cahal clapped him on the shoulder and announced in a loud voice , " I 'm your man , Boru ! You lead and my men will follow , and we will pick up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hell beyond , if that 's how far you have to go to get to Ivar ! " " Very well , " Mahon said , his somber gaze fixed , not on the jubilant warriors , but on the ranks of dead and dying being collected on the plain before him . " We will go on to Limerick . " Without looking at Brian again , he kicked his horse and rode away . They rode knee to knee in pursuit of the fleeing Norse , with their army of Munstermen at their backs , singing the songs of victory . Brian felt his brother 's troubled gaze from time to time but he never acknowledged it ; he limited his conversation to giving orders , or an occasional comment to the spear carrier who ran beside his horse . I know what you want to say to me , Mahon , he thought . I can feel your emotions tugging at me . You would condemn me for the very victory I bring you . You want me to take time for pity , and allow myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Like Deirdre , you want me to be vulnerable . But I can not . I will not . When the wars are over there may be time  | for friendship and compassion and all those Christian virtues , and then I may be as kindly as any man . But not yet first , we must win . He rode above his emotions , carefully protecting the thin skin that separated them from his consciousness , safe only as long as that skin held . It was a dam , and agony was piled up behind it . Brian Boru rode with a closed face , his gray eyes fixed on the road ahead . The sun burned on their uncovered heads , their bare arms browned and glowed from its warmth . Once , a mass of yellow butterflies came up in a cloud from a dip in the land and danced through the ranks of the marching Irish , fluttering against their faces to be fended away with laughter . " Ivar 's sending spies ! " someone shouted , and a wave of guffaws moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat . Those who had food with them gnawed on it as they marched , and bearers ran along the line with waterskins . The evening brought a rising breeze and some of the men said they could smell the Shannon . In the distance there were clustered pinpoints of light . Seeing Limerick waiting for them , an unknown quantity , for the second time that day Brian seriously considered the possibility that he might die . In the dark , in the night , in that pagan , alien port . A Northman might strike him down and it would all go black .. . Watch out ! His mind shield away from the idea like a frightened horse . Such imaginings could drain off that peak of confidence that had carried him , and the army with him , all this long day . But the picture remained there , lying across his thoughts , daring him to look at it closely in the fading light . Would he go to heaven ? Pray perpetually in glory with the saints and the angels ? And if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would God forgive him for being bored in His presence ? Dangerous , blasphemous thoughts for a man who might be on his way to die . If Mahon knew he had such thoughts , his expression would be still more troubled . The rich smell of marsh and me tdowland surrounded them ; the meaty scent of horse sweat anchored them in life .  | I will not die tonight , Brian told himself , and was relieved to find that he believed it . Some other time I can think about dying and the obligations of my immortal soul ; I can do penance and all those acts of Christian charity . Some other time , but not right now . Victory may have to serve me as heaven , and I will put off hell until tomorrow . On the deep level of consciousness he was aware that his mind had carefully skirted specific thoughts of his own mortality , and he was grateful . Visions of the grave , decay , the long darkness .. . On the road before them , dimly visible in the twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indented ridge ran the length of the blade , that depression the Northmen called the Blood Channel , and it was stained with something dark . They all looked at it as they passed , stepping around it carefully , but no man bent to pick it up . Limerick lay at the end of the road , huddled on the river bank . The earthen walls were massive , strengthened with timbers and topped by watchtowers where nervous sentries scanned the horizon , peering through the summer dusk . The approaching Irish heard the cry they raised . The port city was garrisoned and strong enough to withstand a siege , but the Northmen were too shaken by their unexpected defeat to offer more than token resistance . As the first Munstermen reached their gates a few warriors came out to offer battle but then fell back , scrambling for their boats at the river 's edge . Unchecked , the Irish poured into the city . The narrow streets were thronged with people . Mothers darted from doorway to doorway , searching desperately for their older children while clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weapons , thinking to turn back the tide ; but it was too late , and they soon broke and ran , adding to the general confusion . Merchants with their wares piled on carts or strapped to their backs fled before the long-pent-up wrath of the Irish , only to be trapped in narrow alleys and stripped of their valuables and their lives .  | The sight of Ivar 's city inflamed its attackers . Irishmen who had wept with impotent rage when their own homes were burned were quick to put the torch to the Norse dwellings , laughing as they did so with a fearful echo of viking mirth . Doors were battered down , women and children knocked aside as the conquerors reached for revenge with greedy hands . They began mutilating those who fell before them . Brian had felt the tension building in the Irish as they neared the city , and he knew it could not be contained , any more than water could be held in a ruptured cistern . He saw his brother 's commands ignored and felt a remote pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men he led ! Brian pushed his way through the yelling , frenzied mob until he was at Mahon 's side and at last had to seize his brother 's arm to get his attention . " It 's no good , Mahon ! " he yelled above the roar of the screams and the fire . " Let them go ! This is what they 've fought for and dreamed about ; there 's no way you can control them now . " Mahon 's face was contorted with anguish in the lurid light of the burning buildings . " This was never my intention , Brian , not this ... this barbaric massacre ! " He recoiled in horror as a young woman , her hair in flames , dashed from the funeral pyre of her dwelling only to collapse at their feet . The fire engulfed her and a terrible stench of burning hair and cloth reached them , together with a sweeter , subtly more nauseating smell that Brian remembered from long ago , in the ashes of Boruma . Frying fat sizzled and popped . Mahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating uselessly at the flames with his bare hands , and Brian saw that he was crying . The Norsemen who should have stood to defend their city were gone , most of them , already safe aboard their ships and pulling desperately for the open water , leaving the bitter smoke and the fire-stained sky behind them . The few who valued their treasures above their lives lost both , and the Irish scrambled over their dead bodies as they raced one another  | for Ivar 's hall and the hoard abandoned within it ; Ivar and Ilacquin had been on the first ship into the river . The hungry flames that were devouring the wooden city had not yet reached Ivar 's hall when Brian got there . His men stood aside to let him enter , and his first impression of the Norse palace was stunning enough to bring him to an abrupt halt . He stood in the center of the vast room , turning slowly , his eyes wide , and the Munstermen who came crowding in after him did the same . The torches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been the debris left after some colossal flood . The floor was calf-deep in filth and old rushes . Stools and benches were knocked over and strewn about , and even the huge banqueting tables were overturned as mute evidence of the frantic flight of the masters of Limerick . And everywhere , everywhere , was the treasure . " Sweet Christ ! " someone gasped in a voice thick with awe . " This is the loot of half Ireland , " Brian said in wonder . Piled as high as a man 's head against the walls and spilling in mad profusion over the benches and tables was a king 's ransom of merchandise . Irish gold , silver , platters , goblets , flagons ; bolts of silks ; bales of furs ; stacks of samite , shining scarlet and green ; chased leather saddles inlaid with jewels ; boxes of coins and caskets of rare woods ; chalices , croziers , and reliquaries from the monasteries ; bracelets and bangles , torcs and rings , golden bells and mirrors of silver ; jugs and jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fabulous wreckage was a score of young slaves , cuddlesome maidens and well-formed youths . Abandoned by their owners and paralyzed by terror , they mutely awaited whatever fate was to befall them , their eyes blank with shock . They all wore shackles about their ankles , and they all were Irish . Brian gritted his teeth and made his way to the nearest , kicking aside piles of beautifully woven wool and a splendid rack of elk antlers , scrolled round with silver and tipped with pearls . He reached down and hauled a young man to his feet ,  | a sweet-faced boy with golden hair and freckles like butter on his hairless cheeks . " Where are you from ? " Brian asked the trembling youth . The boy 's eyes were starting from his head . " D-D-Desmond , my lord , " he stammered . " Does your king know you are here ? " The boy dropped his lips over his blue eyes , but not before Brian saw the glint of tears . " Yes , my lord , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to free you ? " " He is the prince Molloy of Desmond , " the boy replied , " and he sat at that table this very night , and took his meal with Ivar , and ran away with the others when your army reached the gates . They left us all here to die . " Brian drew his sword and took a firm hold on the boy , who appeared to be about to faint at the sight of the naked blade . " Be still ! " Brian commanded . " I 'm not going to hurt you . " He lifted his arm and brought it down in a powerful arc , severing the horsehair shackle . " You are a free man , " he said . " Get out of here and get yourself home , and tell every person you meet just how you were treated by Molloy of Desmond . And tell , also , that it was Brian of Boruma who saved you . " He set the rest of them free with the same injunction , and assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how long the journey . The looting and burning lasted throughout the night . Brian issued orders that prisoners were to be taken , not slain  --  an order already given by Mahon , but generally ignored . Brian rode through the streets himself , sword in hand , and saw that as many Norse men and women as possible were bound , living , and herded to a holding area beyond the gates . The king had ordered his tent set up at some distance from the city , and Brian at last joined him there . He found Mahon on his knees , on the portable prayer stool that he always took into battle . " We are taking prisoners now , " Brian said briskly . " What do you want done with them ? " Mahon looked up . His face was drawn and pale in the light of the small lamp hung beside his stool . He might have been  | any weary soldier after a battle that had gone against him , instead of a triumphant king who had just won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners , " Brian repeated . " What is to be done with them ? " Mahon looked at his younger brother and wondered just who he was seeing . Brian looked so strong , so sure of himself , his face untouched by the slaughter he had witnessed . There was a smear of blood across his brow ; he wore it as he might wear a gold circlet  --  with elegance and unconcern . " I do n't want to think about the prisoners now , " Mahon said in a vague voice . " I just want the killing to stop . I 've been praying ... " Brian looked over his shoulder , in the direction of the savaged city . " Nothing can stop it now , brother ; neither you nor I. Our people have suffered for too many generations , they have built up hatreds even they were not aware of until this night . What 's happening back there is a cleansing , and it wo n't end until they have rid their nostrils of the stink of the Northmen . " Mahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I understand it . It 's not the same thing . " " But it 's not only Northmen they are killing , Brian ! There are Irish folk in those burning buildings , slaves and concubines . They 're being slaughtered with the rest ; I 've seen it . And the infants , Brian ; the little babies ! I 've seen them snatched up by their ankles , their heads dashed against walls . . . " Mahon 's voice faltered and he passed his hand across his eyes as if it were possible to wipe out that vision . " It was done to us first , by the foreigners , " Brian said in a tight voice . " That does n't make it right ! " " No . " " I led this army here , " Mahon went on , as much to himself as to his brother . " The death of all these innocent people will be charged to my soul . " " Many innocent people die in wartime . You 're torturing yourself to no purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  | know , and I advise you against it . At Sulcoit today we broke the Northman 's hold on Munster ; be proud of that , instead of agonizing over something you can not control . Our people will bless your name for your deeds here , when the smoke clears and the blood dries . " " The blood will never dry , " Mahon mourned . The thread of Brian 's patience snapped . " You were willing enough to march at the head of an army and have people throw flowers and kisses at you ! When the blood of battle finally warmed your veins , you swung your sword with the rest of us and made your kill , and I would be willing to wager a good Kildare horse that you enjoyed it well enough  --  then ! " But if you accept responsibility for part of an act you must accept responsibility for all of it , brother ; the glory of clean battle and the sacking and death of a city are but two faces of the same creature . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reward and the obligation , the cheering and the crying . " Mahon rose heavily from his stool and planted himself in front of the younger man , holding his hands out , palm up , pleading with Brian to understand just this one time . He was still golden , and kingly , and beautiful , and Brian felt the old love move in him . " I never wanted to be king ! " Mahon cried . Brian took a step backward as if from feared contamination . " How can you say such a thing ! " " It 's true , I swear it . By the agony of Christ on the Cross . It was a thing that was forced on me ; no matter which way I turned there were such pressures ... everyone else wanted ... no one else understood ... " Brian 's eyes were wild . " Oh , I understood once , all right ! It nearly cost me my sanity , understanding you ! But I finally put that aside and convinced myself that I had been wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father believed you to be , and that together we could achieve something great . " Now you want to deny your kingship ... Is that what you 're telling me ? " " I hate it ! " Mahon cried . " I hate all of it ! Ordering men to  | their deaths , seeing them turn into ravening beasts , facing the widows afterward ... and the decisions , Brian , and the lives that hang on them ... I never wanted any part of this ! I wanted to be tuath-king of Boruma , and perhaps the chief Dal Cais , if the elders thought me worthy . To plow the land , and see the calves born in the spring ... " There were tears in Mahon 's eyes , and his hands were fumbling at the Cross hung round his neck as if there were nothing left to which he might cling but that . " I tried ! " he said earnestly , but then his voice faltered . " I did my best . I did ... " The night wind shifted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flames and the crashing of timbers . Limerick was a blazing torch , a death pyre as so many Irish settlements had been before it . From his safe place far out in the river Ivar must have seen it ; Molloy and Donovan must have ridden the Norse boats in awed silence , their eyes on the blood-colored sunrise that was not a sunrise . Carts streamed out of the ruined port , heavily laden with viking loot and Norse household goods . A long chain of prisoners marched out of the gates , dragging their feet and coughing from the acrid smoke , alternately guided and jeered at by their Irish captors . Mounted officers galloped back and forth , assuring themselves that their share of the treasure was safely claimed and out of the dying city . The timbers of Ivar 's hall collapsed , and a great shower of glowing sparks flew up into a sky already paling with the first gray of dawn . Still mounted , his sword in his hand , Brian of Boruma rode  | among the survivors , rounding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some semblance of marching order . " You , Led ! " he called out , seeing a scarred , familiar face amid the smoked and grimed straggle of soldiers . " Attend me ! " " Yes , my lord . " The faithful captain rounded his shoulders and ducked his head , using his elbows with skill as he plowed against the force of the crowd streaming along the Tipperary road . " Did my brother pass this way ? " Brian yelled at him . " King Mahon ? I do n't know , my lord  --  I have n't seen him . Has he already gone ? " Brian nodded and reined his tired horse to a halt . Led came to stand at the animal 's shoulder , a weary warrior with a blood-stained sword thrust through his belt , his sturdy body half naked where the tunic had been ripped and torn during the long day . A flash of square white teeth gleamed through an old wound in his cheek , reminder of the day he had stepped between Brian and a Northman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp some time before dawn , " Brian told him . " We had been discussing the disposition of prisoners when a large band of Norsemen came out of hiding in the reeds at the water 's edge , upstream of the city . I went to join battle , and when I got back my brother was gone , leaving no word for me . I was only told that he had headed back to Cashel before first light , and no one knew what he wanted done with the prisoners . " " Ah , " said Led . " Well , that 's a problem , is n't it ? I can hardly think he wanted us to take them all the way back across the Suir ; what would we do with them ? " " What will we do with them here ? " Brian asked , not expecting an answer . " Is that Cahal over there ? " " I think so , my lord . " " Perhaps he and the other chieftains would like to take some of this lot ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would do the Northmen good to learn what life is like for slaves . " Oh , and Leti ... my spear carrier was killed last night .  | Will you send me one to replace him , someone totally trust-worthy ? " Leti nodded . " I know what you ask of a man . I have a fellow from above Ennis , one Padraic by name , devoted to you and very skillful with a spear , though he is a little more than a lad . He has been my right arm for a year , and I give him to you gladly . " Brian gathered the tribal kings in a flower-blanketed meadow to discuss the problem of the prisoners . " Of course we will defer to King Mahon 's wishes in the matter , " Lonergan of the Aes Ella said formally . Brian replied , " That 's the trouble . My brother has gone back to Cashel and left no orders about them , so far as I can learn . We have a large number of prisoners here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our separate kingdoms . " Brian was as red-eyed and begrimed as the rest , but his voice still rang with the clear tones of authority , and the others stood respectfully around him , willing now to put all decisions into his hands . At Brian 's feet was a cluster of little flowers , the exact violet shade of Deirdre 's eyes . He stared thoughtfully at them for a moment ( " ... Kill the Northman ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! ... " ) . Brian raised his head . " Last night in Limerick , I think we all saw the wishes of the people in this matter . The soldiers of Munster wanted to kill and kill until there was no Northman left alive to destroy our homes or rob us of our heritage . " Only those we took prisoner are still living , and I doubt there 's a man who fought yesterday at Sulcoit who would like to see a strong Northman , capable of murder , set free today . " There were nods of agreement and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze over the assembled faces , then asked , " Is Ardan the Slinger among you ? I do n't see him . " " He was slain in the woods at Sulcoit , my lord , " called Kran . " No one saw him fall , but his body was found later , I heard . " Corc the Fifty Killer added , in a voice saddened by grief ,  | " He was struck down by an ax and dragged into the underbrush to die , where nobody could find him in time to save his life . " Brian took a slow , deep breath . At the periphery of his vision another loved one walked away into the distance and was gone . He bowed his head in a brief prayer . When he looked up again his eyes were cold as winter frost ; his voice had the warmth of a January sky . " This is my order , then ; I take full responsibility for it . Have all the prisoners brought to yonder hill , and I want every man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves and divided among you . " The captured Norse were assembled on the hill known as Singland , and forced to kneel amidst the scent of flowers and the whisper of the gently waving grass . Bees hummed ; blossoms opened to the sun . Irish chieftains walked among the prisoners , occasionally claiming a strongly built wench or a young lad who might do for a house slave . Boys past the age of puberty , no matter how healthy or powerfully built , were never considered . There were no small children among the prisoners . The night 's slaughter , undirected as it had seemed , had had a devastating effect on the next generation of Limerick . With one accord , the Irish had killed every child they found , as if answering a cry from the graves of thousands of their murdered children . When the slaves had been set aside and each lot quarreled over and claimed , a detachment of swordsmen came up the hill . Encircled by spearpoints the Northmen waited , their eyes glaring , their throats screaming defiance as death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we showed them mercy ... " one of the officers remarked to Brian . " I will show them mercy , " came the thin-lipped reply . " I will let them all die on the sword , so they can go to their pagan heaven . " The bright day turned gray and a roil of clouds moved in from the west . A Northman , looking up as the swords closed  | in on him , thought he saw the Valkyries waiting in the sky on their rearing warhorses , their breastplates gleaming , their spears raised in a victory salute . Then the red pain tore through him , and he crumpled forward . When it was over and the human wreckage lay quiet on Singland hill , Brian looked toward Limerick once more . A few wisps of greasy smoke still coiled toward the lowering sky . The young spear carrier Leti had sent to him had taken his place at the shoulder of Brian 's house . A rawboned lad with a deeply freckled face and a permanently quizzical expression , he bowed low in awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are Padraic ? " Brian asked . " I am , my lord . And I am deeply honored ... " " Yes , thank you , " Brian interrupted briskly . " If you are to serve me there are times I will need you to be my aide , as well as my spearman , and this is one of those times . We will be pulling out in a few minutes , but first I have something to show you , something secret for your eyes only . Come with me , Padraic ... " In the gentle folds of the land south of the Tipperary road a small cottage nestled , half-buried by a luxuriance of vine and flower . Connlaoch the Weaver had been working his garden patch , but the threat of rain had driven him indoors to sit beneath his thatched roof and rub his arthritic knees . Aoife fed him a hot broth made of grain , and bread slathered with butter freshly brought up from safekeeping in the nearby bog . But the lure of the hearth did not hold Aoife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand in the doorway , looking through the misted afternoon toward the distant road . " There 's a great lot o ' men along over there , " she remarked after a time . Connlaoch ladled another big helping of broth into his wooden bowl . " Aye , " he said indifferently . " Belike it 's the king 's army , come back from Limerick . "  | " Was there a battle ? " she asked over her shoulder , her eyes on the distant , antlike figures . " Now , how would I be knowing that , woman ? First they passed here , going up toward the Shannon , while you were at Market Day . That was . . . yesterday . Or the day before . Now they are passing again , going the other way , so I would guess there was a battle and it 's over . I would say there was a battle . But I do n't know there was a battle . Are you after wanting me , with my bad knees , to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face and brawny of arm , exactly like her husband , and they each had a sprinkling of snow in hair as russet as a fox 's pelt . But the love of combat had not dimmed in either heart ; they fought constantly and with joy , and celebrated their victories on the piled blankets of their bed . " Hist , go along with you , you old fool ! " Aoife chided him now . " Market Day was three days ago , you blathering idiot ! I do n't know what I 've done to deserve a man who ca n't keep track of the days . " Connlaoch mopped his bowl with his bread and grumbled aloud , " ' T is a sin and a shame when a good man has to serve himself while his lazy woman lollygags in doorways and insults him . " Small figures detached themselves from the parade on the distant road and came across the fields toward the weaver 's cottage . A lean , homely youth with a long spear strapped to his back walked beside an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furs and cloth . As they approached , Aoife widened her eyes and took an involuntary step backward , signing the Cross on her jutting bosom . " Saints preserve us , husband ! " she exclaimed . " They 're bringing us treasure ! " The cart creaked to a halt in front of the cottage and the young man came to the door , knuckling his forelock respectfully . " The king 's greeting to you , my lady , " he said , and Aoife wrinkled up her nose at him and struggled to keep from laughing outright . " What does he mean , my lady ' ? " Connlaoch inquired as he came to glower over her shoulder . " I do n't know I 'm sure , but if you 'll pin your lip we may  | find out ! " she hissed at him . " You  --  young man  --  what do you mean , bringing me the king 's greetings ? By my faith , I 've never laid eyes on the man  --  Mahon , is n't it ? ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , my lady , " Padraic told her . " I have been sent to seek out families who have no children at home and would be willing to take one or more in fosterage . " Connlaoch thought the time had definitely come for him to take an active part in the conversation . " Fosterage , is it ? " He moved his wife aside and filled the doorway with his broad body , facing the stranger at close range . The young man smelled of smoke and sweat ; his clothes gave off a bitter pungency that even a cottager could notice . " So the king is sending out children to be raised , is he ? " Connlaoch asked him . ' , Are they his own sons , or the sons of a great chieftain ? What compensation would we be given under the Law ? We can not take children in fosterage for affection 's sake only , for my wife and I are no kin of Cashel . " Padraic had begun to detect an unquenchable twinkle in the blue eyes Connlaoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be successful after all , and Prince Brian would be willing to take him as a permanent aide ! " Ah , I am sorry to say , these babes are no royal sucklings ; I can not tell you their parentage . But they have ... er ... recently come under the protection of a most important man , and a good fee will come with them to reward you for their care . My master wants to be assured that they will be raised properly , as decent Christians , and that they will have the protection of a loving family . " At the finish of his recital Padraic shot a look over the man 's shoulder at his wife , and saw her face aglow . " Babies ! " she exclaimed . " Yes , well , they are very young . " " And how many of them are there ? " " Now , Aoife ! " Connlaoch interposed . " We have n't agreed on this business ; do n't be pushing me into the pond until I 've felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be loved , are n't there ? I  | heard the man . And have n't we had an empty house and two heavy hearts all these years for the lack of little ones ? " She pushed past her husband and thrust her face at Padriac 's . " How many did you say there are ? " Padriac turned to the cart and began lifting the piled furs . Aoife was at his elbow , breathing hard and making little clucking noises . He moved a last covering of slightly scorched wool and there , nestled in blankets at the bottom of the cart and effectively concealed from prying eyes were three small children : two toddlers and a sleeping infant . Silver haired . Square of skull and jaw . " Those are Norsemen ! " Connlaoch exclaimed , shocked . Padraic looked over his shoulder with wide-eyed innocence . " I really would n't know , sir . I only know that they are wards of my master , who is a great prince , and he is willing to exchange the entire contents of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " Connlaoch eyed the cart . The furs and woven goods upon it were a greater treasure than he had seen in his lifetime . But it was too easy come by ; if this lad 's master would part with it so easily , he would part with more . " And what about the cart , itself ? " Connlaoch asked . Padraic hesitated . " Bargain ! " Brian had warned him . " Make them think they 're getting the better of the deal ! " " I ... ah ... I suppose the cart could go , too , " he said at last , sounding dubious and rolling his eyes as if he feared his master 's displeasure . Connlaoch tried to wink at his wife , who had snatched up the smallest child and was rocking back and forth with it in her arms , crooning to it and ignoring her husband . " And the ox ? " Connlaoch pressed . " Oh , well , I really do n't know about the ox ... " " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them , after all , and they will take a sight of feeding , and before you know it they shall have to have cloaks and sandals and one thing or another . I suppose the Law is very clear as to the requirements for children of their station ? " " The Law is explicit in all cases of fosterage , " Padraic as-  | sured him . " They must be well fed and dressed and properly educated , of course . A Brehon will see that you are informed as to the exact requirements . You will take all three ? " " All three ! " Aoife announced unequivocally , examining the two in the cart . " And your master can rest easy , we will raise them as proper Irish Christians . " The children , whatever their blood , were bright and healthy ; the baby girl would bring a good bride-price and the two boys could grow to learn the weaver 's trade and be a great comfort to their foster parents in their old age . She could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's satisfaction . Connlaoch maintained his gruff facade until his wife thrust the baby girl in his arms and the tiny mite opened her eyes and cooed up at him ; then his face dissolved in a helpless grin that warmed Padraic to his toes . The erstwhile spear carrier reported to Brian as soon as he rejoined the line of march . " You are certain they will take good care of them ? " Brian demanded to know . " Oh , yes , my lord ! They know of a woman nearby who is a wet nurse , and they have a fine snug cottage and a garden patch as well . If you could have seen the way their eyes lit up when they held the babies ! It was as if the merciful Christ Himself had guided me to a couple perfectly designed to care for the Northman 's orphans . " " I wish I 'd had the time and the opportunity to save more of them , " Brian said softly . " But remember  --  you are sworn to tell no one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fosterage are to know of it , and they must not know of my connection . Lai swore to me that you were trustworthy . ) , " Yes , my lord ! " " And it will be your special responsibility , Padriac , to check up each year yourself , and see that everything is being done as it should . Never leave anything to chance ; that 's a basic rule of mine . I want to know for certain that they receive a total  | of three cows for each of the boys , and six for the girl , as the Law says girls require more care . And everything without my name 's being mentioned  --  can you do that , lad ? " Padriac 's eyes glowed with pride . " That I can , my lord ! " he assured Brian . " Very well then , it is agreed . I 've already paid the cart driver enough to send him back to the Slieve Aughty mountains a happy man ; he will tell no one that I rescued Norse babies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an act of kindness does you credit . " Brian 's face was momentarily contorted by a huge , crackjaw yawn . " Padraic , " he said when it was satisfyingly concluded , " I make hard decisions and I lead men to their deaths in battle . To follow me without question they need to believe that the iron in me goes straight through , that I am invulnerable , immune to human weakness  --  and sentiment . They need to feel that I am an extension of their own desires , and it was not their desire to save the Northman 's spawn from Limerick . " They went forward in a companionable silence , the spear carrier walking proudly at the horse 's shoulder , Brian sitting as straight as always . After some distance he spoke once more , so low that the youth had to press against his knee in order to hear him . " Of course , " he murmured , not looking at Padraic but keeping his eyes fixed on the road ahead , " there might come a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you understand ? " Padraic , who did not , smiled and nodded . The people of Munster met their returning heroes with showers of blossoms and thrown kisses . It seemed that the  | news of every detail of the battle at Sulcoit had been carried to Cashel by runners , and amply embroidered en route . The king had fought like an emperor , the people were telling one another , and his brother like an avenging archangel . As the first company of soldiers came up the road from the causeway of the Suir crowds met them , singing . Old women called blessings upon them and children ran forward , giggling and daring one another to snatch hairs from the tails of the officers ' horses . Brian 's mount , who had had enough of warfare for a while , laid back his ears and kicked petulantly whenever anyone came too close to his hindquarters , and so was able to make his way in relative peace . Brian 's thoughts ran ahead to Deirdre , waiting somewhere within the stone walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hundred remembered poses . Lovely and shy as a wood violet , her delicacy like a breath of air from some hidden waterfall amid cool ferns . A luminous princess from his boyhood 's tales of champions and their maidens . And then he saw her with the cloud in her eyes , and the barely perceptible shuddering that marked the onset of an attack . He remembered her in a blue-lit chamber on a rainy day , her robe the soft gray of a dove 's breast , her head drooping , her black curls without luster , the low mournful sound of her helpless weeping going on and on . He saw her kneeling on the bed , the depression replaced by hysteria , her face engorged with rage , her mouth stretched into an ugly square as she screamed at him . If only there were someplace else to go ; some way to alter the direction of time so that he would be back on the plain at Sulcoit , with the chanting at his back and his destiny coming to him in one transcendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder , lengthened its stride so that Padraic was forced to run to keep up . Faces beaming with happy smiles lined the roadway on both sides , and joyous voices called out to him . " Welcome , Prince Brian ! " " There he is , the hero of Sulcoit . Wave to him now ! "  | " Brian Boru ! " someone shouted . " Boru ! Boru ! " And the glow returned for a golden moment to light the last few steps of his way . The gates of Cashel swung open . Brian entered with his captains and the chieftains of Munster who had won their own glory at Sulcoit , and as he looked up he saw that the banner of the three lions hung equally with , not below , the king 's banner at the portal . Fithir met them with outstretched hands and a ready explanation for Mahon 's obvious absence . " The king hastened home as soon as the battle ended , " she said smoothly , " so that he might begin the prayers of thanksgiving immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this very moment . He will be so glad to hear you have arrived safely ! " Brian searched her face for some clue . Her expression was so carefully bland it was obvious she was hiding something , and he felt the finger of dread trace down his spine . He made himself ask : " Deirdre ? " Fithir 's face relaxed into a radiant smile . " Oh , my lord , God has been good to us indeed . Your wife was delivered of a healthy son yestereven , and since that time her mind has been as clear as a young girl 's ! " Brian stared at her . " Are you certain ? " " The physician says that childbirth has calmed her almost miraculously . Whereas sometimes it brings a deep melancholy on a woman , in her case it appears to have worked a sort of cure . She is still nervous , you understand , and shy as a coney , but she seems more like herself than she has in months . When you are cleaned and rested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what of the king ? " Brian asked , feeling a drumbeat starting deep within him . A son ... a son .. . The skin of Fithir 's face tightened on its bones and she hesitated . That was it , then . Brian took a half step toward her , to encourage her with his size and proximity , and to his astonishment she melted bonelessly into his arms and began crying . " Oh , Brian , he has seen no one but Marcan and the other priests until this very last hour , when he sent for the barber ! "  | " The barber ? " Brian asked , baffled . Fithir 's sobs redoubled . " He asked to have his hair cut in a tonsure ! Like a monk ! " she wailed . Mahon had returned to Cashel sick at heart . Refusing to see anyone or discuss the battle , he went directly to his private chamber and barred the door . A crowd of courtiers piled up in his wake , each clamoring for an audience , but the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cashel to discuss his possible appointment to the hierarchy of the Church with his brother the king , at last succeeded in talking his way past the guard and knocked on Mahon 's door , calling his name in a loud voice . He was granted a grudging admission . Mahon sat in a lampless darkness , his chin sunk upon his chest ; he did not look at his priestly brother . " What do you want ? " he asked Marcan in a hollow voice . " To remind you of God 's mercy , " Marcan replied smoothly , realizing that the king was in no frame of mind to discuss bishoprics and abbacies . " Whatever burden you bear , dear brother , I assure you that God will lift it from your shoulders if you will only ask Him . " Mahon groaned . " I have looked into Hell ! I have seen the ultimate ugliness of men 's souls . I watched while our own tribesmen turned into beasts like the Northmen .. . and the responsibility was mine ; they murdered babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! " Marcan breathed . He hurried across the room and flung himself on his knees beside his brother . " My lord king , my dear brother , God in His wisdom has surely sent me to you in this moment of your distress . Lean on me and let me help you , and together we will ask God to bring you peace , and comfort for your over-burdened soul . " Marcan 's features arranged themselves into a beatific smile . After several hours he emerged from the chamber and ordered a page to summon the king 's confessor . To him Marcan  | related in triumphant voice , " I have been blessed by God ! I am being allowed to bring the wandering soul of the king to the ultimate realization of God 's plan . He will give up the love of luxury and the sinful trappings of temporal power and be God 's man from henceforth , like the great priest-kings of old . Come with us to the chapel , that we may pray . " The three men knelt together on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended his arms in the Sign of the Cross and held them outstretched , hour after hour , until the agony of his muscles erased the sight of Limerick from his tortured mind . The blaze of religious fervor that had long ago consumed Marcan leaped from him to his brother , and Mahon welcomed it , welcomed its flames that were brighter than his nightmare vision of the dying Norse city . He prostrated himself before the altar and poured out his bitterness and his horror to One who , Marcan assured him , would understand . Brian had not waited to wash himself with the ritual warmed and scented water offered to every guest and resident of Cashel , but had hurried directly to Deirdre 's bedside to see her condition for himself , and feast his eyes on their first-born son . The baby was lusty and red-faced , with an undeniably healthy set of lungs . Deirdre looked pale and shrunken beneath the covers , but her clear gaze was lucid and she smiled brightly at him when Brian entered the room . She lifted one thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " My lord , " she acknowledged softly . At first he was as careful with her as one is in the presence of an old wound , but when her eyes remained dry and her voice cheerful he began to hope that perhaps the baby had , after all , worked a small miracle . " There will be a celebration in the banqueting hall tonight , " he told Deirdre , " and I would like to present myour  --  son formally to the court . " Her eyes misted , not with melancholy but with happiness .  | " I wish I were strong enough to be there with you , " she told him . But Deirdre was not the only member of the king 's family to be absent from the festive occasion . Mahon 's High Seat was empty and Fithir entered the hall alone . When her eyes met Brian 's she shook her head . " The king is still at his prayers , " she told everyone firmly , " and has asked not to be disturbed . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wine was poured a maidservant entered with the infant in her arms , and carefully unfolded the fine linen sheet in which he was wrapped so that everyone could see he was a healthy male . Beaming with pride , Brian lifted the boy above his head . " My son ! " he shouted down the hall . " Murrough mac Brian , prince of the Dal Cais ! " " Murrough mac Brian ! " they thundered back to him amid cheers and blessings . Murrough drew a deep breath and yelled . At his victory celebration , Brian had particularly requested the attendance of those men still living who were survivors with him of the outlaw days in Thomond . Now they entered the hall one by one , cleaned and freshly dressed but with the scars of their most recent battle still on them , and Brian gave to each a special token , some treasure of exceeding value liberated from the Norse city . As they came and knelt before him , the herald read their names and Aed made a brief poem , reciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aengus , who had been their physician when they had no other . Leti of the Long Knife , his face permanently scarred into a grin that Brian found beautiful , because he knew its price . Kian and Brendan and Illan Finn . The brothers Loaghaire and Reardon Bent-Knee . Fergus the Fist and Conaing the Beautiful Chief . But no Nessa . Nor Ardan . There were two piles of treasure in their names , the finest of all , scrupulously set aside on a table apart from the others . And their names and deeds were recited by Aed that all might hear .  | The torches burned late in the hall , and the cheering and singing could be heard clearly in the chapel where Mahon knelt . " You are a born killer and you will go on killing , " Mahon accused , not looking at his youngest brother . Brian had finally forced a confrontation by invading the king 's private chamber , and now they stood , separated by more than space , in a room Brian scarcely recognized . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from the cold walls , the floors were bare of rushes , even the wealth of lamps had been replaced by one feeble stub of a candle . The chamber now held only a thin pallet and a chest , and one black crucifix hung on the wall . It was the cell of an ascetic . " What have you done with your things ? " Brian asked , ignoring his brother 's accusation . " I do n't understand . . . " He waved his hand at the stripped room . " No , of course you do n't , " Mahon answered . " All you understand is warfare . Brutality . Lust for power . You do n't realize that material objects are of no consequence compared to the wealth of the spiritual life . I 've been praying to Our Lord to enlighten you as He has me , but so far my prayers are unanswered . " Brian scowled . " You do n't need to pray for my soul , brother . " Mahon gave him a look of curiously commingled disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must ! You and I both have so many guilts to expiate ; you surely earned God 's wrath for the evil you unleashed at Limerick , and I ... " " Is that what this is all about ? You 're trying to punish yourself for what happened at Limerick ? " " I could never punish myself sufficiently for what happened at Limerick ! I can only try , and beg God 's forgiveness . I misunderstood the nature of war . I let myself be seduced by the trappings and the excitement , I let my vanity blind me to the horrors around me , but I can see them all now , and I must atone. "  | " Atone ! " Brian snorted . " What have you got to atone for ? Ivar and his allies are nursing their wounds on some sandy island infested with black flies , where the Fergus joins the Shannon . Irish families that have quarreled with one another for years are united now , proud of being Munstermen together , singing your praises and speaking of the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners . By God , that 's an accomplishment to be proud of , and yet you sit here beating your breast and crying mea culpa . I tell you frankly , brother , I would n't want a conscience like yours ; there is no logic in it . " Mahon looked at him bleakly . " And I no longer want a soul like yours , barbarous and cruel . You are the wolf who devours the lambs to fill his own belly . Marcan has convinced me that we must walk in the paths of peace , accepting God 's will and ... " " Marcan ! " Brian exploded . " Marcan is a priest , with his own view of God 's will , and I do n't happen to think that view is right for our situation . I 'm not even convinced that it is God 's will that we be victims , though Marcan used to expend a lot of energy trying to convince me of it . He could not persuade me and so he has gone to work on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... his accomplishment . " The deep voice was bitingly sarcastic . " Marcan has brought me peace , Brian ; he has shown me that there are other paths that I may follow . God sent him to me when I needed him most . " " God did n't send him ! Marcan came here himself to beg your influence in having him named bishop of Killaloe . Marcan may preach humility , but he hungers for power within the Church as much as any tribal king hungers to expand his holdings . " " I will war no more , Brian , no matter what you say , for it brings me too much pain . I sent your own brothers into battle ill-prepared , I think , and knew the guilt of seeing them die for a kingship I did not really value , even then . I tried to do better by you , and yet when I see what you have become I think I would rather have buried you somewhere in Tipperary , with  | Lachtna and Niall . I will build a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You think that is the best way for you to serve God ? Charlemagne built churches , too , but he had a sword in his hand and it was with that sword that he brought Christianity to the Franks . " " I renounce the sword forever ! " Mahon cried . Sensitive to something in his tone , Brian studied the king 's face intently . At last he said , " It is not God 's wrath that frightens you , brother . I think you are afraid of something in yourself . You enjoyed the killing , if only for a moment  --  some moment back there on the plain of Sulcoit , perhaps . " Marcan is a shrewd dog , and he found that chink in your armor , did n't he ? And worked on it ? " Mahon 's body had stiffened into a column of outrage , but his eyes were haunted . " You 've made a pact with the forces of evil , Brian , " he whispered into the stillness of the room . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hidden . " Brian 's smile was small and bitter . " I made no unholy pact , Mahon . I 've merely learned to examine myself in the long watches of the night , and I never lie to myself about what I find . Knowing my own truth makes it easier for me to recognize certain signs in others . There are similarities in all of us , if we admit to them . With part of my mind I can understand even the Northman 's joy in destruction , and with another part of my mind I can share a child 's innocent pleasures or know a priest 's hunger for God . " You have gradually become more and more horrified by the brutality you see , and I suppose that does you credit . But you are afraid that it has stained your soul with some permanent mark that wo n't wash off , and you have become desperate for forgiveness of one of the very qualities God gave you in the first place . " If you would have peace , genuine peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to be comfortable with them . You ca n't cut away one part of your nature as a physician cuts away rotten flesh .  | " You must continue to be strong and valiant , because if you wo n't fight to protect what you have won , every Dane and Norseman , every greedy scoundrel and born thief , will come a-gallop to Munster to pick its bones . If you care about these people , Mahon , be a strong king and defend them ! " Mahon slumped against the carved olivewood chest , cradling his head in his hands and swaying gently from side to side . " I can not , Brian , " he said in a muffled voice . " I can not take men into battle anymore . " A vast pity swept Brian . This is what I wanted , he told himself , only not this way . Not this way . He carefully kept both pity and sympathy out of his voice as he told his brother , " Then I will do it for you . Be the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the rest to me . " On the first night of the new moon , Deirdre returned to his chamber from the ladies ' wing . " The physician says I am well , my lord , and able to resume my duties as your wife . " " You want to ? " She dropped her eyelids , the long lashes sweeping in a curve over her cheeks , then looked up again and smiled . " I want to please you , Brian . I know that I have not ... always . . . " " You were ill . " He hastened to excuse her . " I suppose so . But I 'm all right now , and I do love you , my lord ! " She knew the shadows were still there , waiting in the corners . But since Murrough 's birth she had begun to find she need not look at them . With each passing day she felt more insulated , less vulnerable to them , wrapped securely in some mystical cocoon she shared with her baby . Mothers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their power , and she was a mother now . She turned her back on the shadows and saw instead the beauty of her husband . She remembered the songs the harper had sung of him , and imagined how glorious he must have been at Sulcoit . The lips framed by his crisply waving beard were soft , cool , and breathsweet . But when they parted his  | mouth was hot and hungry , clamping on hers with a passion too long contained . She could not respond in kind ; it took all her new strength to push the fear below the surface and hold it there . But she gave what she could , with love , if not with passion . She lay beneath him , fighting her desire to resist , wondering at the alien power of the emotion that gripped him and curiously flattered by it . This thing Brian called lovemaking had an intensity she had experienced only through the medium of terror , and when she felt him plunge deeply into her with the last , spending thrust , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . That which was forever dreadful to her gave Brian a reward she could not even begin to imagine . She put her hand against the back of his head and pressed his face into the hollow of her shoulder , so that he could not see the glitter of tears in her eyes . His heart hammered against her , his breath singed her skin . But he was hers . The worst moment was over , endured , survived ; now she was free to love him . Her fingers twined themselves gently in his hair . " Welcome home , my lord , " she whispered softly . In the dark and desolate cave beneath the roots of the tree Yggdrasil , where the three Norns dwelt at the ends of the earth , weaving the fates of men , the threads that controlled the life of Olaf Cuaran had become exceedingly tangled . Even in distant Dublin he felt them twisting about him , pressing the air from his lungs , and he grew irritable and morose . Everything seemed to be turning to ashes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in himself were crumbling beneath his feet . He spoke of it to his old viking comrade Magnus Ulricsson , whose warship Windwalker had just brought news of the latest setbacks in Northumbria . On Mother Night , the longest night of the year and parent to all other nights , they sat together over their drinking horns , and Olaf 's thoughts were blacker than the starred darkness beyond the walls . " It is n't just the news from the Saxon lands , Magnus , " he said , staring gloomily at his clenched fists on the table . " The Saxons have always fought our efforts to control that land , and I suppose it is inevitable that they challenge our dominance from time to time . " " This is more than a challenge , Olaf . We are suffering severe losses and we may even lose control of York city ; then we would have no port on the Humber . " York , once a glittering prize that Olaf had claimed as part of his far-flung kingdom , seemed that night to be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was gnawing his vitals . The possible loss of his holdings to the east was a fitting part of the dark tapestry his life had become . " We are losing more than the Saxon territories , my friend , " he told Magnus . " The very gods have deserted us , and we suffer defeat after defeat at the hands of Celtic upstarts who would not have dared face us in battle a generation ago . My own wife laughs at me . " His broad shoulders slumped and his head sank forward in despair . Magnus snorted derisively . " Your wife ! What does that matter ? She 's only Irish . Have someone run her through with a sword , that will teach her proper respect , and then get yourself a new and better one . " " It is n't that easy . For one thing , she is the sister of Maelmordha , prince of Leinster , and I would not have his hand raised against me . Already I am threatened by Munster and Meath , and the Ulstermen are howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say ? You need fear nothing from them ? they spend all their time fighting amongst themselves . They  | are even worse about it than the rest of the Irish . Besides , Ivar of limerick will keep them too occupied to come adventuring in your territory . " Olaf sighed heavily . " You have been away , Magnus , living a good life in the Saxon lands where things are simple . On this cursed island nothing is as it seems ; friends become foes overnight and there is magic in the very rocks . Bad magic . " Magnus swung round on his bench to stare at his friend . " What 's this you 're saying ? I do not recognize such words , coming from you ; this is not the talk of the great Olaf Cuaran ! This is late night talk when the drinking horn has been filled too many times . " " No , I only wish it were . But I speak the truth , Magnus . Ever since I wed Gormlaith  --  perhaps even before that ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker to recognize . This is the land of the Christians , not of Oldin and Thor and Freya . We can not hold it in their names and if we continue to try we are doomed . We go into battle against the Cross and we are cut to pieces . " Magnus was becoming alarmed . " Your wits are addled ! You have a few unimportant setbacks and believe their one god is more powerful than all of ours . But just stop and think , man , how many times we have made the Celt flee in terror or grovel in the mud . Why , we hold all this island in one clenched fist ! " " No more , no more , " Olaf said in a barely audible voice . " Why , what 's happened ? " " You spoke of Ivar of Limerick  --  he is limerick no longer . Six months ago , Mahon of Munster destroyed Ivar 's army and sacked the city . It is ashes and rubble , and Ivar has fled to Scattery Island , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Ivar 's , as you know ; ours is an old rivalry , but his loss is mine too in this case . Munster is now united under the Dal Cais , and I fear they will join with Malachi of Meath , who has shown sympathy with their cause , and all march on Dublin . " " Irish kings standing together ? I do n't believe it ! " " Neither did I , but it is true . There is a new feeling in the  | land , spreading outward from Cashel , and we are beginning to hear rumors of a plan to drive Norse and Dane alike from Ireland . " " Talk ! Boastful Irish talk and nothing else . You know how they love to brag , these people who can not fight . " " Ah , but they can fight , Magnus . Like you , I underrated them , but no longer . " " And where did they get this prowess on the battlefield ? From the Munster king  --  what 's his name ? ? Mahon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an indifferent warrior ; he nipped at Ivar 's heels for years without ever being a real threat . Now all of that is changed . In one battle after another , the men of Munster have met and crushed good Northmen ; this very day I heard that Ivar may be forced to flee to Wales , where Donovan of Hy Carbery has some allies who have offered him support . " " I think I need more ale , " Magnus commented . " I 've tried ale and I 've tried women ; I 've had the Runes read and made sacrifices to every god , but nothing helps . Day by day , fortune slips away from me and I am powerless to prevent it . I 've come to one conclusion , Magnus , and I am telling it to you first because you 've been my friend since we first fed our swords wound-dew together . I 've decided to become a Christian . " Magnus sat bolt upright . " You 've what ! I ca n't believe my ears , the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard me . We are too far from the old gods ; they have no power to help us here . I have long suspected it and now I am certain . I will convert to the White Christ and ask his protection instead , for he is young and vigorous in this land and his priests say he is a god of compassion . I need compassion . I 'm an old man with a young wife and enemies on every side . There is more for me in Christ 's religion than in Odin 's . " " That young wife of yours , is it her hand I recognize in this ? " Olaf laughed without humor . " Gormlaith has no interest in converting new disciples to the Christ ; she is much too in-  | volved in her own schemes . I tell you , Magnus , that woman is not the least of my problems ! " When I first became aware of the threat from Meath , she was plaguing me at the time for something to occupy her mind . Almost in jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to handle him  --  after all , she knows the Irish disposition . To my surprise , she set about it as if the whole thing were a serious military campaign ! In a most unwomanly way she organized a system of spies and acquired a complete history of the man . She came to me and described his character for me as fully as if they had been raised in the same crib . " " She must be an extraordinary woman . " Olaf 's expression became even more despondent . " She is that . Extraordinary . She has no talent at all for woman 's business , and no interest in it ; she must be forever pushing her oar in where it is not wanted , and her deepest desire seems to be to stir up trouble . If I did not exhaust myself keeping her occupied she would have every man in Dublin at his neighbor 's throat by this time tomorrow . " " And yet it is said of her that she is the fairest woman in Ireland , " Magnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his downcast host , and curious to see for himself the Irish princess with a man 's mind and a body like no other woman 's . " There is a song sung of her in the streets ; it is said that she is best gifted in everything that is not in her own power , and does all things ill over which she has any power . " Olaf expelled a long , quivering sigh . " Aye , that 's Gormlaith . " " Then why do you not do as I suggested and get rid of her ? Surely her brother 's goodwill is not that important to you  --  a mere Irishman , after all ! " " If I were a younger , stronger man , I would . I have several good sons by women I kept before her , all Northmen at heart and capable of taking my place when I am gone . But Gormlaith has also borne me a son , Sitric , a strapping big boy who reminds me more of myself than any of the others . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own him . If I throw out the mother and keep the son I know she will bring  | her brother down on me , and if you have contempt for the 11 anger of the Irish , I do not . Not anymore . I want to make no more enemies among them . I am already spread too thin , Magnus , I can not afford that . " " You are in a trap , then , old Ravenfeeder . " " I know it . " Magnus swirled his drinking horn in his hand , staring down into the dark brown liquid . " Perhaps there is a way out , for a patient man , " he said at last . " The Irish can not go for long without losing their tempers with one another , as you and I both know . They are divided into too many factions to all sleep comfortably in the same bed . If you only maintain things as they are and wait , they will fall to quarreling among themselves as they always have and can easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them . Incite them against one another . Remind them of old grievances and start new feuds . They are an easy people to goad . " " That would not be a Christian thing to do , " Olaf said , but there was a light in his eyes . " Do you intend to adopt this Christianity all the way through , or only on the surface ? " " As deep as it needs to go , I suppose . " " Then take my advice and keep your viking heart , my friend . If it gives you comfort to embrace the White Christ do so , but do not think that means you must abandon Ireland to the Celts . Give them enough time and the Irish will destroy their own strength . " " But how much time is enough time ' ? " Olaf asked . The next morning , Magnus arose early . Olaf 's unease had communicated itself to him in some fashion , and he had spent a bad night , fragmented by dreams that were too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted like dead fish . There was nothing to be done for it but get up and begin the day . He stepped over the sleeping bodies of Olaf 's men and made his way out of the hall . The pallid sky was pregnant with snow . He stood with his back to the Norse palace ,  | stretching , forcing the cold air into his lungs where it cut like new knives . " Magnus Ulricsson , " said a voice behind him . A throaty , rich voice ; a voice the color of dark amber . " Are you trying to escape without ever having greeted your king 's wife ? " He turned . Magnus thought himself a tall man , but the princess of Leinster was taller . Big-boned in the way of the Irish peasant class , she had the elegantly structured face of a noblewoman . Her bosom was a white swan 's , broad and full , and no man could look at it without wanting to bury his face between those magnificent breasts . Firm-waisted , she was broad of hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulated in a subtle mimickry of the way a woman thrust her pelvis against a man in the act of love . He did not notice what she wore . Gormlaith 's skin was rich cream , glowing and flawless . Her large mouth was red-lipped , quivering , the full underlip moistly inviting . Green eyes , the green of Ireland itself , blazing , emerald , fiery with unquenchable life . And crowning it all , her hair . Her hair such as no other woman on earth possessed . A flame of dark red so pure in color that it had bluish lights , it was plaited and crossed atop her head to form an incomparable crown , then hung in great loops and swags of braid to her hips . She advanced toward him , insolent in her power , smiling and holding out her hand . She took one step closer than any other woman would have , and he steeled himself to avoid stepping back . The natural fragrance of her flesh was that of ripe apricots in the sun ; beneath it lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal in heat . " My husband never introduces me to his guests , " she said , although her eyes were saying other things . " At least , not to the big , strong ones . He tells me about them after they 've gone . " She took a deep breath and slowly shifted her weight from one hip to the other . Magnus seemed to have acquired an obstruction in his  | throat . He spoke around it with difficulty . " Your husband is a prudent man , my lady ! " Her eyes glittered with amusement . " He has learned to be one . Olaf is old and worn , not the man he once was . Tell me , Magnus Ulricsson  --  are you the man you were in your youth ? " Challenge was implicit in every line of her body and syllable of her speech . Magnus felt that he was standing too close to a fire that would strip his flesh from his bones . He tried to move away unobtrusively . But she noticed , and her eyes danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering her own question . " I am a student of men , Magnus ; did my husband tell you that ? I collect them , as other women collect jewels or robes . But they must be the strongest and best . Why do you suppose is the strongest man in Ireland today ? " " Your husband , the Iron Shoe . Olaf Cuaran , " he answered loyally . " You lie , " she laughed at him . " I do n't mind that  --  I tell lies myself . But surely you know that he has little strength left ; his power is peeling away from him like the layers of a boiled onion . Forget Olaf ; I will give you the answer . " The superior man is Malachi of Meath , he who already calls himself Malachi Mor  --  Malachi the Great . He will be Ard Ri when old Donall is dead , and the Stone of Fal will cry aloud for him . Ireland will have a High King such as she has not known for generations . The five provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you be certain of that ? " She shifted her weight again , closing the space between them . Though the day was cold a dew of sweat had begun to form on Magnus 's upper lip . " I have made it my business to know a great deal about Malachi Mor , " he told him . " He is the obvious successor to the kingship of Tara ; he is of the southern branch of the Hy Neill , and the Ard Ri has always been of the Hy Neill . Donall is northern Hy Neill , so by the tradition of alternate kingship it will go next to the south . Malachi is young and aggressive , hungry to make a name for himself to rival that of his famous  | ancestor , the first Malachi Mor . There is no other man in the land with a future such as his . " " What about this king of Munster , Mahon the Dalcassian ? Is n't he coming to be something of a force among the Irish ? " Gormlaith lifted her silky eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable that a usurper from a minor tribe should be crowned Ard Ri at Tara . No , it will be Malachi , and my poor husband is already shivering in his sleep for fear of him . " It was hard for Magnus to imagine that any man could so unnerve Olaf Cuaran , the conqueror of Northumbria , victor of a hundred savage battles . " You misjudge Olaf , woman , " he said sternly , determined to put an end to her aggression before it became too threatening . " He is a magnificent warrior , he has made of these Irish a subservient race , and he will not lie trembling in his bed this night or any other , just because one of them rises against him . " She tossed her head . Her smile was no longer hot and full of promises . It was as if he had failed some vital test . " Olaf is a man to be broken , like any other man , " she said . " I could break you , Magnus Ulricsson , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little man , a weak man , an old man like my husband . The sap has dried in you . It would be more interesting to match myself against , say , this Malachi Mor . " She turned her shoulder to him then and looked away . " A storm is coming , " she said in a voice grown cool with disinterest . " Can you smell it ? I love storms . " Then she whirled away and was gone , and where she had been there was a cold emptiness.  | A long season of peace came to Munster . A landman could plant his crop , harvest it , let the land lie fallow , and then plant again , and still it was not watered with the blood of his children . The Northmen skulked along the coast and pieced together the shattered fragments of their strength , but each time they challenged the power of Cashel an army marched out behind the king 's brother , and death came with it . The Norse bided their time , licking their wounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fellowship he had once felt toward the Irish in Munster began to fade in the light of his own ambition . He called back those of his troops who had stood with Mahon and employed them in continuing campaigns against the foreigners in his own kingdom and the Leinstermen to the south . The monument that was Cashel brooded beneath wintry skies and glowed in the summer sun . Marcan was often there , closing the gap between his elder brother and his God , encouraging Mahan in the religious fervor that grew within him . From dawn to dark prayers arose from the precincts of Cashel , punctuated occasionally by the cries of an infant as Brian 's children were born . Conor followed Murrough with but a year between them , and then Sabia , a lovely miniature of her mother , and next the dimpled daughter they named Emer , for Cuchullain 's wife . And Flann , and merry Teigue . If the policies of Munster were the policies of Brian of Boruma , few knew that but Brian and the king . With each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions to make , the responsibilities to carry , and Brian accepted them all without hesitation . To him , Mahon had  | ceased being the king ; he was God 's man now  --  and , sometimes , Fithir 's , although his marriage had not rekindled his interest in things of the flesh as much as that lady might have desired . Apart from all of them , from Mahon and Deirdre and even his children , Brian lived alone within himself . And waited , as the Northmen waited . Something was coming alive in his mind . Sometimes he could catch a glimpse of it , a glimmering of an outline , a fragment of a perimeter , and he knew with deep certainty that the time would come when it would all be there , intact and perfect . It need not be rushed . It grew quietly in the dark , nourished by his experiences and his love . He thought of it not as a dream , but as a presence . The green land , the passionate , intensely alive people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory to myth , to some prehistoric dawn he could not even imagine . Ireland . A need to love which could not be fearlessly bestowed on any mortal being could be satisfied by the country herself . She could not die . If a man could weave himself into her very fabric she would be his forever , capable of absorbing all his passion , his to safeguard and cherish . Ireland . The beautiful , ravaged , troubled land . The sum of the parts of all her people . More than that . The shape in his mind began to firm . He could grasp its dimensions , and the size of it astonished him but did not frighten him . Once he had thought all his being consecrated to the destruction of the Northmen , but now he could see that was only a part of the overall task . The foreigners were but an obstacle to be removed from the road . The road ? The words came to him and he played around with them , rearranging them in his head , waiting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was there , finished and dazzling , in the center of his soul . The Empire of the Irish , as Charlemagne had built the Em-  | pire of the Franks , but stronger , immortal as Charlemagne 's was not . A land under God , where education and art were valued as the most precious of human accomplishments . An empire kept safe by the strength he would give it , where books would not be burned nor children butchered . The Empire of the Celts , of harps and hospitality , of poetry and peace . But it must be won by the sword . He began to be hungry for this thing that had never been . With Deirdre he was gentle and wary , always conscious on some level of the wounds within her that might break open once more . When she was tired she grew fretful , and her tears fell as easily as a child 's  --  there was the constant worry that they might not stop . She could not be joked with , nor could she endure casual play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required her total forbearance , and he was aware of it . But though she felt no pleasure in their conception , she took pleasure in the little ones themselves , and it was the belief of everyone that her babies kept her quiet and sane . There was never any question of putting them out to fosterage . Noble families routinely exchanged children , to strengthen the ties between them , but , when Aed mentioned it in a passing conversation , Fithir silenced him with a stern glare . " My sister 's children will be raised in her household and no other , seanchai ! They do her more good than all your wisdom or the physician 's medicaments . " " But it is the tradition , my lady . Young ones are being sent to Cashel from the four corners of Munster in accordance with the custom , and they expect like in return , or how else can we be of one family ? " Fithir answered him resolutely . " The king and I will have many children and see one in every powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But speak no more of sending Deirdre 's away , and ask the Brehons not to mention it to her ; even a whisper might do her harm . " Aed was saddened . Any break with tradition was a sacrilege to him , and though not every family participated in the ritual of fosterage he believed deeply in the wisdom of the  | custom . He also saw , with the eyes of the observant , that Fithir was moving past her childbearing years and had not yet conceived . She holds Brian 's children close to warm her own heart , as well as for her sister 's sake , he thought . The youngsters wove a thread of merriment through Cashel . Murrough in particular was the light in his father 's eyes . He lacked Brian 's serious side , but he was a sturdy little fellow , scrappy and full of pranks , and he poured his enormous energy and opinionated spirit into everything he did . From earliest infancy Murrough had seemed to be very much his own person , and Brian delighted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstrong impulses . It was Murrough who was responsible for the scurry of cats at Cashel . As soon as he was old enough to straddle a pony he had ranged far from the Rock , fearless as an eagle , returning at day 's end with some present to placate his parents . Once it was a cloakful of squirming cats . " A little girl in the woods gave them to me , father , " he explained to an amused Brian . " She said her mother wanted you to have them ! " Brian cocked an eyebrow and tried to appear serious . " And what would I be doing with a tribe of kittens ? Are you sure this is n't your latest army , little general ? " " Oh , no , my lord ! " Murrough insisted . " I was told they were a gift for you . To keep down mice , I expect , " he added earnestly . The cats were incorporated into the life of Cashel . They were good ratters , but they became more particularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . Murrough liked having his own way . On the eve of the young prince 's eighth birthday , Brian and Padraic were returning with a company of warriors from a skirmish exercise , a war game Brian had devised to keep his troops battle-ready in the absence of Northmen . Padraic , Brian 's shadow , had come to be more than an aide ; he was as much of a confidant as Brian would allow himself , and the younger man was proud and jealous of his position . They were discussing the morrow 's festivities . " The boy  | will be pleased with the banquet planned in his honor , I think , " Brian told Padraic . " My brother the king intends to be back from Bruree , where he has gone to hold out the hand of friendship to Donovan of Hy Carbery . Bishop Marcan will be celebrating Mass , and that wild boar I speared in Graedhe 's Woods is turning on the spit this very hour . We shall have a feast suitable for the son of a king ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Padraic said , almost under his breath . " Hush , " Brian reprimanded him sternly . " I wo n't have you saying such things , even in private . " " In all but name ... " " Enough ! " Brian 's voice cut him off sharply . " The son of the king will be Mahon 's first-born in marriage , if he has one . I belive that a strong dynasty passed from father to son would be the best way of insuring stability for us . As for myself , I have no kingship to offer my heirs , so I must give them something else ; something of more value , perhaps . " " What could that be , my lord ? " Brian 's eyes stared forward , through Time . " A legend , " he said . " I want to know , before I die , that when I am gone the harpers in the halls will still sing of me . That is a thing I can assure within my lifetime , so that my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a force that shaped the world they will inherit , a source of pride to be handed down to their children 's children . " " You are already a legend among your men , my lord , " Padraic assured him . " Thank you for that , my friend . I work at it , as well you know ; you 've seen my hands shake when I make speeches , and you know that I deliberately conceal them , so they do not spoil the image . The books I study , the lessons I set myself to learn  --  they are all part of something I am building piece by piece . Each bit of it must fit perfectly with the others . " " How can you know when it does ? " Padraic asked . " In the same way a singer knows he has sung the right note , or a harper knows to touch the strings that create a chord that feeds his soul . I know , that 's all .  | " The time will come when it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know when or how , but everything I have made of myself will be of value someday . " Padraic 's eyes shone . " You believe in destiny , my lord ? " Brian 's answer was firm . " I believe in myself . I was given a good mind and a strong body , which gifts obligate me to use them to the best of my ability . I was given a hunger for power , which some men might call evil , but I believe that it can be a force for great good . The only alternative to educated power is brute force , mindless , inhuman , a rolling stone that crushes everything in its path . That is infinitely more immoral than ability used wisely , Padraic . " I can not deny my ambition  --  not to myself , nor to you . The addiction to power is the end result of a long series of small seductions . It begins as a reaction to some real or imagined injustice , as a grain of sand irritates an oyster into producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of strength , influence , the ability to get things done . " All the power I possess or can gain will be used to win something more than a mere kingship , Padraic ; something I can hand down to my sons with great pride . " They were nearing the Rock . The road broadened and was harder , beaten down by many feet , rutted by carts and the wheels of an occasional chariot . Soft gray stone , moss frosted , edged up through the thin crust of the soil like bare knees pushing through worn trews . A skittering of midges thickened the air . A speck was racing down the road toward them , pursued by a cloud of dust . As it drew near it resolved itself into a man on horseback , hair streaming , eyes wild . He sawed on the rein and set his mount on its haunches directly under the nose of Brian 's own animal . " My lord ! Fearsome news ! " In reflex , Brian 's hand dropped to his sword hilt . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken captive , my lord ! It is a piece of the most dreadful treachery ! "  | Beneath the bronze of his wind-burned skin , the blood fled from Brian 's face . " How do you know this ? " " Some of those who went with him to Bruree escaped and have just returned to Cashel , my lord , in dreadful condition . They fled for their lives across Munster and arrived but an hour ago . They say that instead of receiving King Mahon as an honored guest in his home , that whoreson Donovan laid hands upon him as soon as he arrived and bound him with ropes and chain . He 's being delivered like butcher 's meat , handed over to Molloy of Desmond and his foreign allies ! " A dreadful moan was wrung from Brian . " I warned him ! God , I ... he would n't listen ! He was so certain ... he said Christ was with him in all things ... he said he had to settle the differences between Cashel and the southern tribes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you called it . . . " He turned to Padraic and flung his hands wide . " I tried to keep him from going to Donovan and asking for one of his sons to raise at Cashel . You heard me , Padraic ! I told him it was a mistake . Did n't I ? Did n't I ? " Padraic felt as if he had just been told that the sun would not rise in the morning . " Yes , my lord , " he said faintly . King Mahon ... ? It seemed impossible . " Why would n't he listen to me ? " Brian went on , rocking back and froth on his horse in the excess of his emotion . " I understood Desmond and Hy Carbery better than he did . Those are proud men , with long memories , and they bear grudges . Mahon forgives ... forgave ... I knew they had not . " He doubled one impotent fist and pounded it against the rock-hard muscle of his thigh . " I should have stopped him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless rhythm of the beating hand . " I should have stopped him .. . stopped him ... " " What 's this ? " The officers were crowding around now , scenting bad news . " The king is taken ? " " What of the safeguards he was given from the bishop and clergy of Cork ? " someone asked . " He put much trust in them . "  | The messenger shook his head . " Donovan laughed at them . " " Bishop Marcan will be angered to hear that ! " cried Kian , running up in time for the worst of the news . " And what of the holy symbol the king had pinned to his breast ? I saw it myself , the gold reliquary with a gold cross upon it , and a fragment of the gospel of Saint Finnbarr inside . " " I know not , " was the reply . " All that gold  --  Donovan probably stole it , " a voice growled . " That short-beard bastard ! That clay-coated sea slug ! " " Calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , " Brian growled , recovering himself a little . " Let 's get on to Cashel and determine what 's to be done . " They were met by uproar . Fithir , with queenly calm , had taken charge of the household , but the hall and yards were a-swirl with nobles and warriors , weeping servants and scurrying priests . Olan , pensioned off in the time of peace , came thundering in with his sword in his hand and the scars on his old face livid with rage . " How could you let this happen ? " he roared at Brian as soon as he saw him . Brian did not take time to answer . There was blame enough to go round , and the coldness in his breast told him that he would absorb it all himself when he had the leisure to reflect . But for now there were orders to be given , organization to be wrought out of chaos , and the entire community looked to him . He convened the council of state and heard the pitiful tale once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been allowed to escape . Only the king 's hide was of value to Donovan . " I fear they will kill him , my lord ! " Mahon 's steward exclaimed . " Do n't say that ; we must not even think it . Grief and fear will weaken us and given them the advantage , and this situation must be handled quickly , with all our cleverness . " The  | steward stood before the council table , tears rolling down his cheeks . He had been but a man 's length from Mahon when the traitors seized him . Brian fought to get his attention . " Tell me ... tell me ! ... are you certain they are taking him to the prince of Desmond ? " " We believe so , my lord , " the man sobbed . " And are the Northmen involved ? Look up and answer me ; you can cry later . Are the Northmen involved in this thing ? " The steward made a valiant effort to control himself . " They are tied into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stronghold at Bruree we had news of the presence of Ivar 's men in the neighborhood . Some of the nobles wanted to turn back , but the king would n't listen . " Brian turned to the councilors . " I have feared this ever since Ivar came back from Wales . He has sulked too long at a distance , brewing up his mischief , and I told my brother more than once that a placid surface does not mean there are no treacherous currents beneath . We have done all we could to intimidate them with our arms and our power , but Molloy has never lost his hunger for Cashel nor the Northmen their taste for revenge . The question is , now that they have acted , how can we thwart their intent ? " " We must send the army in full might to Desmond ! " Kernac thundered , banging his walking stick on the floor . The one-legged veteran had a seat of honor on the council , and though it took two men to lift him he was still considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Mahon is taken to him , " Brian said . " These men tell us he was gone from Bruree in chains on the night of his capture . He is Molloy 's by now . " Olan 's voice was sepulchral . " Unless they have taken him north , to give him directly into Ivar 's hands . The cowards may prefer to have Ivar do their murdering for them . " Kernac shook his head . " Molloy must hate Mahon very much by now . I doubt he would let Ivar have the satisfaction of killing him . Either way , the king is a dead man . "  | The men gathered in the council chamber argued far into the night , seeking hope and finding none , snatching up plans and discarding them . But the urgency was gone ; they all knew they were howling into the wind . Mahon 's fate was in God 's hands . As Brian at last stumbled from the chamber , gritty-eyed and longing for a few hours of oblivion before he assembled the army for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to his chamber . " Father ? " He peered down at the sturdy boy standing in front of him . His own face , with Deirdre 's coloring , looked back at him . " You should be abed , Murrough ! Where is your nurse , or your mother ? " " Oh , they think I 'm asleep ! I tiptoed ! But I could n't stay in bed , not after I heard about the king . Will they kill him ? " The simple childish question demanded equal candor . " Yes , " said Brian , feeling strangely that he was condemning his brother to death by admitting it . Murrough looked up  --  far up  --  at the awesome figure towering above him . To have such a man for a father was the source of much pride , and no little boasting to the sons of the other nobles , but in truth he was shy in Brian 's presence and half afraid . The great prince was always so busy , so preoccupied . A boy 's foolishness was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rare that Murrough got uv enough nerve to demand attention . Tonight was an exceptional time . " If he dies , will you be king ? " Murrough asked . Brian groaned inwardly . There was no way to answer that . He looked down at the earnest young face , then slowly lowered his weary body to crouch beside his son on the cold stone floor . Seen that way Brian became more human , and Murrough ventured a shy smile . " I mean , I 'd be very sorry to see the king dead , for he has always been kind to me . I 'll sing at his wake if I am permitted , and I 'll take part in the funeral games and win a race in his honor . " He tried very hard to pitch his  | voice lower and sound mature , and he stood with his legs braced apart and his back very straight . His eyes were shining . " But I will be proud of you , my lord , if you are made king , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Then he stared in dismay at the effect of his words . Brian 's face darkened in the torchlight , then crumpled like a linen napkin . His shoulders heaved . A sound came from him , a wordless noise , a cry of suffering such as Murrough had never heard his father utter . Brian stood up and wrapped the boy in his arms , puffing Murrough tight against his chest , so that the boy felt his father 's tremendous strength and wondered how he knew just how hard to squeeze without causing pain . Brian 's voice rumbled around him , " My son , my son . Some day there will be genuine peace in Ireland , and then we 'll have time to spend together and get to know one another . I promise it . " He released the child reluctantly , his arms still tingling with the feel of his son , and the love that must be put aside for more pressing matters choked in his throat . He could not let go and indulge himself in feeling ; there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad an abrupt pat on the rump and pushed him down the passageway . " Get back to your warm bed , Murrough , " he ordered , " and leave me to the task at hand . " " You 're going to rescue the king ? " asked the eager voice . Brian could not answer . He went to his chamber and looked longingly at the bed . Then with a deep sigh he summoned a page and sent for his maps of the land of Desmond . He dashed cold water on his face and knuckled his reddened eyes , then sat down with the charts spread before him and began calculating distances and times . Beyond Cashel , the sky turned ashen with the false promise of dawn . Wearied beyond weariness , Brian at last slumped back on his seat , his right arm lying across the table , his left arm fall-  | ing of its own weight to dangle beside him . A measure of time passed . Something brushed against those inert fingers . A whisper of fur touched his skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistent push against his idle hand . Behind his closed eyes Brian could envision one of the cats pacing back and forth in a small figure eight , pleading silently for his attention . He stretched out his hand and the cat filled it , setting up a happy humming . Idly , he stroked the narrow back , feeling it hump up to accept his caress and lift its tail to stop the gesture so that he might begin again . His fingers explored the fragile skull , seeking out those places beneath the chin and at the base of the ears where a skillful rubbing could send a cat into raptures . Beautiful silk and sinew creature , made by its Creator to be uniquely graceful . Gentle , savage , vulnerable , yet willing to offer a moment 's trust . Without ever looking down he found himself smiling , and the cat knew it and responded , expanding the volume of its purring until the vibrations were carried up Brian 's arm and throughout his being . Somehow , magically , the pall of weariness lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the night receded . The cat flowed through his hands like water and disappeared from the room . The road was not even a good cart track , merely a narrow serpentine of a path worn by cattle in search of water . It wound through the heather and climbed toward a tumble of mountains . Peering ahead through the morning mist , Mahon recognized the approach to the pass of Barnaderg . " We are near Ballyorgan ? " he asked the man leading his horse .  | The guard turned toward him , his dark face sullen under a thatch of tangled hair . " Aye , " he said , and spat . He gave the leadrope a rough jerk and the horse broke into a jolting trot . Mahon 's wrists were bound behind his back with rope that sawed endlessly at the skin , but at least the heavy chains had been removed so that he could ride . He was in the center of a hollow square of armed men ; not a guard of honor but of menace . Donovan had stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied smirk on his face , and had even raised his hand in a mock salute when Mahon was led past him . " Fare you well , king ! " he had taunted . " You have broken the sacred obligation of hospitality , " Mahon replied in a voice rimed with frost . " You are unfit to speak to me ! " " Praise God , I shall never have to again , " Donovan told him . They moved into the narrow pass of Barnaderg , and the stony path was hard on the horses . The guards pulled Mahon from his mount and ordered him to walk . The trail was full of rocks and several times he stumbled , falling once to his knees . The captain ordered the binding removed from his hands then . " After all , " he laughed , " this is a gift from Donovan to Molloy of Desmond , and we want to be certain it is delivered in good condition ! " Hostile laughter rippled through the ranks of armed men . Mahon held his head high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left Bruree that he was being sent to Prince Molloy , but no one would tell him why . It was best to hope that he would be held for ransom , humiliated perhaps , pressured to give up the kingship of Munster . If only they knew , he thought , how gladly I would relinquish it ! It can be taken from me by the merest twist of the wrist  --  but not from my brother . They will have to deal with him , and that is a very different matter . They may not realize how different . The thought of Brian started his heart thudding with hope . Surely by now word of his capture had , reached Cashel ; many of his party had been allowed to flee the scene . Brian would  | come to get him , all flags flying ! His eyes brightened with the thought of the impending rescue , but then he felt his soul counting the number who would die in the battle . More blood on my head . There must be some way to prevent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he called to the captain . The man checked his stride and sauntered towards him . " What is it ? " His voice was flat , without respect . " Do you know ... what is planned for me ? " " I do n't know , and I do n't really care . You stole Cashel from its rightful heirs , and it 's up to them to decide what 's to be done with you . I only have orders to turn you over to the prince of Desmond in good condition . " They filed through the pass in silence . In the distance they could see men coming up to meet them , and as they drew nearer Mahon 's guard commented , " It appears you are to be treated better than you deserve . There is the escort sent from Molloy , and I can make out priests among them , so you 'll be handled fairly . " Mahon squinted ; then he too was able to see the little group of men in clerical robes walking with the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with relief . " May I have my Bible from my pack ? I would like to be carrying it when I meet my brothers in Christ . " " You nobles always like to make a big impression , " the guard grumbled , but he signaled to one of the men to fetch the Bible . Mahon received it with thanksgiving . Ever since they had stolen Saint Finnbarr 's relic from him he had felt peculiarly alone , almost as if God had deserted him . But now he was in touch again . Everything would be all right . Within view of the pass but a safe distance from it , Molloy of Desmond waited with a band of his followers and a company of armed men . He saw the tiny figures of the two groups merge ; raising one hand , he fingered the massive ruby that hung around his neck on a chain of silver . " Enough of silver , " he said to the man nearest him . " I was born for gold . "  | Donovan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahon alone to meet his escort . He stood straight , with only a fleeting thought that this might be the last time he would greet anyone as the king of Munster . A sunbeam broke through the overcast and haloed his hair . Ignoring the soldiers advancing upon him , he smiled a greeting at the little band of clergymen who walked with them . And then he looked at the soldiers , who were not pausing to salute him . He saw their intent in their faces , and he knew . Knowing , he was aware that he wanted to meet death with courage , to die as a Christian martyr with Christ 's holy name on his lips . He saw the death blow coming at him and realized , with a soldier 's knowledge , that it would cleave his torso and his gushing blood would soak the Bible he carried , obliterating God 's sacred word . He flung the book wildly from him , trying to hurl it into the safe haven of a thornbush , but his aim was bad and he hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled man , only just becoming aware that murder was about to be done in his presence , caught the Bible by reflex and stared open mouthed at Mahon . The upraised sword sliced toward him . Mahon lifted his chin to meet the coming darkness  --  and at the last moment something within him gave way without his permission , and he dodged sideways and tried to run . Molloy saw the downward flash of the sword in the sun . It was done , then . He wanted to cheer . He looked around and called for his horse , and as he did so a puzzled voice asked at his elbow , " What is it you want me to do ? " An elderly priest , one of the number he had summoned to give this occasion its spurious sanctity , stood beside him looking puzzled . He had stayed behind when his fellows went to meet the Dalcassian , and now he was unaware what had happened and was peering at the distant scene in bewilderment . Molloy swung onto his horse 's back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Cure yonder man if he should come to  | you ! " Laughing , he drummed his heels into the horse 's ribs and galloped away . The other priests came running back over the broken ground , their faces ashen with shock and horror . " Murder ! Murder ! " they cried , crowding around the old one , repeating themselves endlessly in their disbelief . " We have been used as dupes , as bait ! We have been tricked into mocking God ! Instead of going to meet Mahon of Munster and seeing to his safety , we lured him to his death . He is killed , murdered , when he thought himself welcomed to the bosom of the Church ! " A thrill of revulsion ran through them . Some fell to their knees to pray for the fallen king . Others went back , drawing strength from the company of one another , and approached the place where he lay , quite alone now , staring at the sky . They shut his eyes and covered him with their cloaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . " We must send word to his household , and to the bishop of Cork , " they told one another . " He was deceived even as we were ; the princes of Desmond told him they were anxious for peace when all they really wanted was to get this good man in their grasp and kill him . " One of the younger priests shook his head as he wiped his blood-stained hands on his clothes . " It will not go well with Prince Molloy for having done this evil thing . " He looked with distaste at the brown smear on the rough gray wool . " But who will punish him ? " he asked . There would be no shining rescue . They brought Mahon back to Cashel on a cart , his multicolored cloak of kingship spread over him . The priest who had caught his Bible accompanied him ; he had wept as he laid the book atop the dead king 's chest . " I would have taken the blow myself , if I had known it was coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . The skies wept for Mahon . A tomb was prepared for the murdered king in a drumming downpour that left clothes and spirits sodden . Fithir , who had buried a husband before , squeezed her plumpness into the same gown of mourning and  | felt a pang of guilt . " What kind of a woman am I , to have outlived two men ? " she asked her maid . " Fortunate , " was the succinct reply . Mahon was to rest in hallowed ground at Cashel , a stone tomb shielding his bones , a stone cross above him . The somber celebrants of the funeral ritual arrived to pay him homage , fewer than had attended his coronation . The political wind had taken an unexpected shift ; a man must keep his allegiances fluid and not be too conspicuous in his mourning . Brian was a tall column of inheld pain . It burned in the hollows of his gray eyes . From the moment they learned Mahon was dead , he had been the prisoner of an accumulation of guilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sought his death , Brian 's inner voice accused him endlessly . I stood over him as he slept and planned to kill him . I justified it to myself as a necessity as surely as Molloy must have done . It was only by God 's grace that mine was not his assassin 's hand . Once I wanted him dead . Wished for it . And now his lifeless body lies at Cashel , surrounded by candles . Once I dreamed of the things I could accomplish if only I had his power . And now the kingship of Munster is vacant . But sweet Jesus , how can I believe that my brother 's murder is God 's way of answering my prayers ? What kind of God is that ? He writhed and twisted inwardly , and no one saw . I almost killed him once , that merciless voice reminded him . And perhaps , because of me and my ambition , another man has acted as my surrogate and completed that crime . I thought I had escaped the guilt of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dream that was not his . He had begun to find serenity within himself , the peace which this world would not grant . And he is gone , and I am left at war with myself . What can I possibly do to make the life that is left me worth the price he paid ? Brian went out into the rain and stood alone at the edge of the area where the tomb was being prepared . The workmen  | saw him , a gaunt figure wrapped in a dark cloak , but they stayed out of his way and avoided his eyes . Cahal came to him at last , braving the weather and glaring up at the skies as if his annoyance would lessen the downpour . He had to put his hand on Brian 's arm and squeeze hard before the prince would turn and look at him . " We 're all worried , my lord ! " he called above the incessant rain . " Desmond will be marching on us soon , I fear ; there 's no doubt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made immediately . " Brian looked at him from a far distance . It took a while before he recognized Cahal , and then another space of time before Cahal 's words made sense . They seemed to be a meaningless babble . Kingships . Politics . More fighting . It took a tremendous effort of will to focus on those things , and keep his eyes away from the tomb being built for his brother . " Molloy will not profit from his crime , " Brian said at last in a dead voice . " But what 's to be done ? Now that he has shown himself to be strong he will find new allies and the Owenachts will rally behind him . And there 's Ivar ... " Brian turned away as if the subject held no interest for him . " We will talk of it later , " he said dully . He was not to be left alone with his pain . There were too many questions and no answers , and , apologetically , the chieftains and officers sought him out , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to the urgencies of the living . He spoke with them at last in the king 's council chamber , where the empty High Seat loomed as a stark reminder . " What is to be done ? " they all clamored to know . The tuath-kings , each with his own family and small community to care for ; the princes who claimed the allegiance of many tuaths ; the officers whose men were waiting in their tents and in the muddy fields  --  they crowded together like nervous horses about to bolt at a clap of thunder , and Brian smelled their fear in the room .  | He still wore the clothes he had worn as he stood in the rain beside his brother 's unfinished tomb . They dripped into an icy puddle at his feet . " I have promised Cahal of Delvin More that the prince of Desmond will not make a triumph of King Mahon 's killing , " he told them . " The treacherous Molloy shall not rule Munster , giving away its riches to his Norse allies and destroying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign saw less warfare and more folk fairs , and that is the way it must continue in his memory . The murderers will be punished and peace secured , and a new order raised in the land . " " A new order ? " they asked , surprised . " This outrage was committed because the old laws of succession encouraged it , " Brian said in an impassioned voice . " Kings have been chosen from alternate tribes in an effort to placate everyone , which in reality only sets one side against the other . The result is that a man like Molloy now thinks he has a perfect right to rule Munster just because it 's his turn . " But I tell you , the continuation of that policy will keep our land forever fragmented , the tribes at war with one another . The king should be the man best qualified to rule , a man blessed with strength and prepared by education . We must have one royal family , one dynasty , one unity of vision and purpose . We must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders . Tradition is not sacrosanct ; a bad tradition must be set aside and a better one established . " " But it is n't done that way ! " Aed exclaimed , scandalized . " It will be now , " Brian replied with determination . In the damp meadows below the Rock of Cashel , the commonfolk gathered to pray for their dead king . In small groups along the muddy road , in little clusters beneath the dripping trees , they kept their vigil . Some carried lighted candles to cut through the gloom of the day , showing their respect with that small extravagance . Some carried crucifixes . Many had come a long distance , across countryside made safe during Mahon 's reign .  | The nobles passed them by , riding up the road to the fortress . At the very edge of the road , half hidden in a clump of young birch trees , a woman stood . A small brown woman , wrapped in a common bratt  --  she might almost have been a deer , watching there . A child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucifixes but mistletoe , and their lips moved in prayer like the Christians . But they were not Christians . Fiona kept her watch throughout the long day , ignoring her tired feet and aching back , her eyes fixed on the road . He might come out ; he might speak a word to his brother 's people . The child grew fretful and whined , and she took some dried meat from the bag slung at her waist and shared it with the little girl . " Be still , " she admonished her . " You will be a woman in a very few years ; you must learn patience . I promise you we will go home , when all is over . " In the king 's hall at Cashel , his subjects assembled to say their last good-byes . The funeral games had been played , the victors of each race and contest eulogized by Aed and given silver circlets according to the custom . The banquet tables were spread with food ; the air was crowded with praises and reminiscences of the dead king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the commonfolk below the Rock played their own bagpipes in memoriam . It was the final day . The tomb was ready ; the body would wait no longer . It lay on a trestle in the center of the hall , a quiet shape beneath a pallium of velvet . Upon the dead king 's chest were his Bible and the crown of Munster , a dull gold in the melancholy light . All those who loved him were gathered for the leavetaking , the hour when Mahon would leave his hall for the last time , to be carried by a guard of honor to the damp tomb beneath the dripping rocks . In turn , they had each knelt before the bier , hearts bowed , hearts full . It was not a day to be stingy with tears ; as Aed reminded them . " The gift , of tears is the mark of a noble soul . " Mahon 's subjects wept without restraint .  | Last to come forward was Brian . When only Fithir remained at Mahon 's side , seated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her keening shrill in the hall  --  Brian entered the room . The onlookers raised their eyes to him , and some gasped . He was dressed in a single garment , an aged and ragged tunic belted at his waist with a worn leather strip . The cloth was stained with irregular dark blotches , so old that they might have been woven into the fabric . The briars of Thomond had torn that tunic , and Norse blood as well as Irish was on it . He wore it as if it were ermine . In one hand he carried his naked sword , in the other the little harp he sometimes played for Deirdre . Brian knelt at the king 's feet and laid the sword there . I am here , brother . You wanted me to suffer , and I am suffering . But I promise you , your death was not my desire . I am as hurt by the sight of destruction as you wished me to be , and a lifetime would not be enough for my atonement if I chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . But I will not . The time for blame is over . I must go on . He rose and turned to face outward , his back to the silent figure on the bier . He lifted the harp and ran his fingers gently , tentatively over the exquisite instrument . The other harpers fell silent , and Brian alone played the last music for Mahon , son of Cennedi . He began with the Gentrai , the laughing , merry strains that evoked the boy his brother had once been . The lilting tune brought a smile to the lips and an invitation to the feet , as if death were a thing with no power to still the joy of living . The music drifted , changed , sank into the heartbreaking lament of the Goltrai , the keening for the dead . A thousand years of tears were in the voice of the harp , a liquid inconsolable grief as old as the loss of Eden . The music was woodsmoke and a doe 's eyes , the pain of a child 's grave , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banshee floated down the wind , and children clung to their mothers ' knees and shivered .  | The hands that could wield the heaviest ax flickered delicately over the strings . Brian 's deep , strong voice rose with the music and filled the hall . " The death of Mahon is grievous to me The majestic king of Cashel the renowned ; Alas , alas that he fell not in battle , Under cover of his broad shield ; Alas that in friendship he trusted To the treacherous word of Donovan . It was an evil deed for Molloy To murder the great and majestic king ; And if my hand retains its power He shall not escape my vengeance . Either I shall fall  --  without dread , without regret ? Or he will meet a sudden death by my hand , I feel that my heart will burst If I avenge not our noble king . " When the lament died away , the sobbing in the hall was being healed in the first flush of anger , and men and women with tear-stained faces were holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  almost in a whisper : " Boru ! Boru ! " ? and one voice after another took it up . The chant rose , swelled , filled the hall . " Boru ! Born ! " Brian stood erect then , his face unreadable . He felt the presence of the martyred man behind him and saw the road ahead of him open now , and clear , though stained with blood . The blood could not be put back in the ruined body . The opportunity to set foot on the road might never come again . He laid down his harp and picked up the sword , thrusting it through his belt . " Born ! " they cried . With hands he forced to be steady he lifted the gold circlet from the dead king 's chest , and placed it on his own head .  | And the roar that was raised in the hall of Cashel thundered out across the green land . It took two years to get them all . There were those who threw the epithet Usurper. ! more savagely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused him men or aid . There were traditionalists who listened and nodded at his wisdom and yet refused to sanction a break with the past , and those who were afraid , and those who might be won over by long conversations far into the night . The time had come for Brian of Boruma to learn the art of diplomacy . But there was always one immediate goal : Mahon 's killers must be punished , must be denied even the smallest reward for their crime . He began with Ivar . The leadership of the Dal Cats and the control of Thomond were Brian 's at his brother 's death , for no man stood to claim them from him . He made good use of his new power . The officers who had shared the last , desperate stand with him in the mountains beyond Boruma were placed in charge of the entire army of Thomond , and every man who could fight was summoned to attack Ivar in his stronghold on Scattery Island . Brian himself led the attack on the earthen walls the Northmen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the boats craftsmen were hurrying to build to his order on Munster 's waterways . In his hand he carried an Irish sword  --  he would not kill Ivar with a Norse ax  --  and he nursed his hatred in his heart as a thrifty woman nurses a flame on the hearth on a cold night . " When we break through to Ivar , remember that he is  | mine , " Brian warned his men repeatedly . " If any man puts a mark on him first , that man shall answer to me . Fight well , use your soldiers carefully , and put no one in unnecessary danger  --  and as soon as you find Ivar , send for me . " But there was no need to send for Brian . He was in the forefront of the attack that charged through the doorway to the room where Ivar waited , an old man past his fighting days , the rot of age in his joints and sinews . Brian waved his men back and advanced on the Norse king alone . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accented Norse . Ivar gave no vocal answer , merely bared his remaining teeth in the practiced and mirthless grin of a warrior and waited . But his eyes were still keen ; he clearly saw the man who stood before him , tall as the tallest Northman , with the history of Ireland on his face . There would be no escape this time . Brain lifted his sword . He saw Ivar glance at it . " You have no weapon ? " he asked . Ivar glared at him and gave a curt shake of his head . " I need no weapon against an Irish dog , " he snarled . Some of the tension went out of Brian . Here was a chance , one of those golden moments that can be turned to immortal treasure by the alchemy of a bard 's retelling . He made himself smile at Ivar . " I understand your belief is that you must die with a sword in your hand to reach Valhalla , Northman ; is that not so ? " Ivar watched him , narrowing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had been younger , stronger ... ah , but it hardly mattered anymore . Because he was old his men had deserted him and left him to die , the vaunted brotherhood of the Northmen forgotten , corrupted by this alien land . Death was no stranger , and Valhalla was a promise given a child and soon forgotten . " Here ! " Brian cried suddenly , tossing his own sword at Ivar . " I would not deny any man his heaven , nor kill any enemy in cold blood as was done to my brother . Fight for your life or your death , foreigner ! "  | Ivar 's shocked mind reacted with the old quickness , but his hands were slower . He grabbed at the sword , caught it , fumbled it , and struggled to lift its weight while Brian stood unarmed , watching him , smiling . And when at last he held it firmly , the hilt clasped in both his hands and his feet parted in as good a fighting stance as he could manage , Brian came toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken back in the heart of his last stronghold , while its buildings were ignited by Irish torches to provide his funeral pyre . Two of Ivar 's sons lay dead on the banks of the island ; the oldest , Harold , had fled safely to his old ally Donovan . Crouched in hiding in a wooden chest in one of the storerooms , thinking himself overlooked by Boru 's men , Ivar 's brother Ilacquin heard the first crackle of the flames without realizing what they represented . Then he smelled smoke , and thrust violently against the tightly fitted lid of the chest . Irish swords were preferable to being roasted alive ! But the chest was strongly made , and the damp air of Scattery Island had caused the wood to swell . Doubled up within it , Ilacquin was unable to get enough room to straighten his arms and force it open . Growing desperate , he hammered against the lid , yelling for someone to come and help him . Only the , roar of the fire answered . Hungry , insatiable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues . As the frantic Ilacquin at last broke free of his prison , a gust of air swept the room and the blaze leaped high , igniting his clothes and turning him into a living , screaming torch . He did not scream for long . Brian and his men laid waste to the rest of the island , then turned south toward the land of Hy Carbery , and Donovan . On the first anniversary of Mahon 's death Bruree was burned to the ground , and Donovan and Harold Ivarson slain , together with a vast number of their followers . On the charred trunk of a sycamore that had stood by Donovan 's gate Brian  | left a banner hanging , its defiant three lions clawing the breeze . Those who might have stood with Molley sided with him no longer . He waited in Desmond , watching a thin trickle of men desert him every day . " My mistake was one of ignorance , " he lamented to his wife on the privacy of their pillow . " I saw Mahon and thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed his brother was merely his general . I have destroyed the weaker man and brought the stronger down on my head . " " You had no way of knowing , a mhuirnin , " his wife said , trying to comfort him . Molloy sat up on the bed and nursed his knees . " I should have known , " he muttered . " I should have made it my business to learn everything about the Dalcassians before I challenged them . That 's the way Boru does it . But I mocked Mahon and made sport of his clergy , and now there is an avenging angel at Cashel , honing the edge of his sword and thirsting for my blood . " " You always tempted God . You laughed at His priests and defied his commandments , and I warned you and warned you about it . You know I did . I told you many times ... " " Oh , be quiet , " Molloy groaned , turning his back to her . The months passed , and Brian let Molloy wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pleasant to drowse in bed at night , safe , sure , the strong stone walls embracing him ; or lie in front of his tent in the army camp , watching the stars wheel above him , and imagine the agony of Molloy , waiting . It was part of the punishment . " I 'm a vindictive man , Padraic , " he commented one day . " I never really realized that before . " " Oh , I 'm sure you 're not , my lord , " his aide was quick to reply . But Brian refused to have his self-knowledge muddied by illusion . " No , it 's true , " he insisted . " I can harbor a grudge for years , and I never forget an insult or slight . The priests tell me these are weaknesses I must overcome , and my brother Marcan prays for me to be given a more forgiving spirit . He  | can afford to pray  --  vengeance is not in his province ; he has God for that . Munster has me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vengeful nature ; he even appeared proud of it . Brian was proud of many things , including his own pride . Yet surely these were sins .. . Brian made them sound like virtues . Padraic shook his head and smiled good-naturedly . " I must confess I do n't always understand what you say , my lord , " he told Brian , " but the way you say it makes it seem right ! " At the end of the year , Brian grew weary of the game . The satisfaction was wrung out of it . He sent the prince of Desmond a formal challenge to battle , instructing the envoy to make it plain to Molloy that no truce or peace would be accepted and no payment taken for the murdered king . Nothing would do but open battle . There was no reply . For two years , ever since Mahon 's death , Brian had had agents in Desmond , reporting to him on Molloy 's every move . He was determined that the man not slip through his fingers ; no ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molloy was to wait , feeling the sands run out of his glass , until Brian was ready for him . And now Brian was ready . He sought out Deirdre , to tell her personally and as gently as possible that the time had come for one more campaign . He found her with the children , her lap piled with sewing . The needle flashed in her thin fingers  --  when had she gotten so thin ? ? as she smiled down at little Teigue , who leaned against his mother 's knee , begging for a story . " Did n't I tell you a tale yestereven ? " Deirdre asked him , a smile at the corner of her mouth . The boy looked up at her with innocent eyes . " I do n't remember it , " he said flatly . Emer , shocked , contradicted him . " Yes , you do ! " she began . " It was all about the pookah , and , ... " Teigue glared across Deirdre 's lap at his sister . " I do n't re- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more volume . " Maybe she just told you . Nobody ever tells me a story for my very own . You get stories , and Sabia and Flann get stories , but I never ... " The laugh pulled loose from Deirdre 's lips and rippled softly about the room , warming it . Brian stood in the angle of the doorway , seeing but unseen , and found that he was listening as eagerly as the children . " Very well . " Deirdre capitulated . " One story , just for Teigue , though I know I 've told you a score since the last Saint 's Day . " " Have n't , " Teigue murmured under his breath , pleased . They gathered around their mother 's feet , dropping to the stone floor with the boneless grace of the young . Even Murrough came and hung over the back of Deirdre 's seat , and Brian realized with a start how large the boy had grown , how soon he would be a man . Where does the time go ? We have n't begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off with a horse and a sword . " Have I told you the story of Tir-na-n-Og ? " Deirdre asked the children . As if pulled by one string their heads moved in unison , left to right and back again . " Very well , then . It 's time you heard it as it was told to me , to give me sweet dreams in my bed at night . " Deirdre took a deep breath and began the story , her soft voice barely reaching to the corners of the chamber . In his hidden alcove Brian strained to hear her . " Tir-na-n-Og is the land of perpetual youth , where all is beauty and death is unknown . It is the Place of Radiance . Do you know how the morning looks after a rainy night , when moisture glistens on every leaf and the bright sunshine breaks through and dazzles us ? Well , Tir-na-n-Og is like that , and it makes you feel that way  --  as if your heart were too big to stay inside your breast . " " O0000h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The ancient gods live there , the immortals who were in Ireland before the coming of Christendom . Lugh of the Silver Spear , and Dagda of the great Cauldron that gives life to the  | dead and food to the living , and Angus Og , who is the soul of poetry , and all the large and small spirits of the woods and hills . " Some people call that land Hy Brazil , the Isle of the Blest , because that is where heroes go as a reward for their courage and steadfastness . It is said that the great Cuchullain himself is there , with Conchobar , and Fionn mac Cumhaill . " " And Conn the Hundred-Fighter ! " Murrough interrupted , unable to listen in silence any longer . " And his lifelong enemy Owen Mor . Aed says that once they divided Ireland between them , and Conn took the northern half and Owen Mor laid claim to all the rest , and ... " " We are not talking of battles this day , Murrough ! " Deirdre repoved him sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you are . Sit down on your stool and listen ; it will do you good to hear something of peace and beauty . " Murrough sank back on the stool , but it was not his way to accept a rebuff or a criticism . Soon he jumped up and left the room , brushing past Brian without even noticing him . Deirdre looked after him , and sighed . " Go on ! " Teigue begged her . " Ah ... yes , Tir-na-n-Og . It is a place that is everywhere and nowhere , for it is not bound by the laws of time and space as we know them . Sometimes it is beneath the sea , and if you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of its crystal towers rising above the waves in the dawn . Other times it floats atop the water , appearing and vanishing again . The sainted Brendan himself set sail for it , convinced it was the lost Garden of Eden and could be reached in a curragh if his faith was strong enough . " " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faith strong enough ? " " That 's another story , and must be told some other time , " Deirdre answered . " On clear days Tir-na-n-Og is sometimes glimpsed from the westernmost cliffs of Ireland , and its music comes drifting over the waters like a forgotten song . Many have dived into the sea and attempted to swim to it . The dark in heart are always drowned and washed back upon the p 300 rocks . Only the strong and beautiful in spirit wade through the surf and onto the shores of Hy Brazil . " But few truly have the ability to be happy in such a world , strange as that may seem . There are those who grow discontented , even in Tir-na-n-bg , because there is no challenge for them there . They must return to the land of the mortals and continue to fight for life and food and a bit of earth to be buried in . " " It is n't heaven you 're talking about , is it , Mother ? " asked Conor , wrinkling his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is n't heaven . Not the heaven in the Bible . It 's a pagan place , and the stories about it are so old that no one knows where they came from . " " But is it true , is there really a Tir-na-n-Og ? " Emer crowded against her mother , looking hopefully into Deirdre 's face . There are some questions that must never be answered , Brian thought . He stepped from his hiding place into the light , and felt the old familiar pain when he saw the sudden fright leap in his wife 's eyes . Whatever malign force it was that had blighted her life with terror , it still stood between them . Cashel was not Tir-na-n-0g ; his lovely princess lived in a dark and fearful world . His children regarded him with varying degrees of awe . He stood on one side of the invisible line called adulthood , and they on the other  --  and he could never remember having crossed over . He felt a mild surprise that they did not recognize in him their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were their common heritage . But he could not drop down on the floor with them and say , " Go on , Deirdre , tell us another story . " He could not say , " Yes , there is a land of Tir-na-n-0g , and I will take you all there to be happy forever . " He could not even say , " I love you , Deirdre  --  do n't look at me like that . " " Leave us , " he said to the children , not unkindly . " I need to talk with your mother . " The flowerlike face she lifted to him was as beautiful as  | ever , all traces of fear carefully wiped from the shadowed violet eyes . But he knew without having to think about it that if he put a casual hand on her shoulder she would tremble , and if he stood too close to her she would shrink inside her clothes , and tolerate him . Only tolerate him . It was this place , this dark and gloomy pile of ancient stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctity and incense that somehow stifled children 's laughter . Mahon had wanted to turn it all into a splendid religious center , a shrine as far removed from life as Tfr-na-n-Og was from reality , and had he lived there might have come a time when there were no banquet tables at Cashel , no marriage beds , no little ones racing and laughing through the passageways . And it might be better so . " My lady , I 've come to bid you good-bye for a while , " he began , couching his words as gently as possible . But she always knew . " You 're going to war again ? " " It 's Molloy of Desmond . The time has come when he must stand to account for my brother 's murder ; I can put it off no longer . I go to dispense long-overdue justice , Deirdre . " She said nothing , merely watched his face . A fantasy flickered across his mind : Deirdre with tears in her eyes , throwing her arms around him , begging him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as Fithir had clung to Mahon the morning Mahon left for Bruree . As Fiona had once clung to him . " Be careful , " Deirdre said at last , her voice very low . He had to leave her with something . " When I was a boy , " he told her , " there was a hill where I used to play . It was a piece of high ground overlooking the Shannon , not far from Boruma , and a favorite game of mine was to go up there alone and pretend that I was a king . " Her eyes were fixed on his face . " I am king now , Deirdre . King of Thomond , and , when Molloy is dead , undisputed king of Munster . And I want my own stronghold from which to rule . Let the priests have Cashel ; that will please Marcan , he can offer it as a penance  | dearly bought with blood . If you like the idea , when I come back from the west country I will have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our very own . A place of radiance . " Her eyes widened ; he had heard the story she was telling , then , and was offering to build a Tir-na-n-Og for her . If she had the strength to believe in it . " Are you asking for my approval , my lord ? You are the king ; you need no one 's permission save that of God . " " I ca n't give a gift unless there is someone to receive it , Deirdre . Would you want me to build a palace for you on the hill at Kincora , if I promise you that it will be as beautiful and secure as mortal man can make it ? " She dropped her eyes to her hands , twisting together in her lap . It was so much easier to talk to him when there were other people around ! " Yes , Brian , " she told him , her voice so soft that he had to lean over her to hear it , which alarmed her and irritated him . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good intentions slipping away . She pitched her voice louder , so that it sounded shrill and unnatural to her own ears . " Yes , my lord ! I would be very happy to share such a palace with you ! " And then she knew that in some curious way she had hurt him , and her guilt gave her the audacity to reach out and take his big brown hand with her own small white one . " Please , Brian , " she said in a more normal tone , " I really would like it . It would be so good to leave here ; I 've always hated this place . " He was surprised . " I did n't know that ! Why did n't you tell me ? " " I did n't know there was anything to be done about it . " " Ah , lady , there is always something that can be done . If I had known you felt that way we would never have lived here at all . We could have had a compound of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suir . But you must share your feelings with me , Deirdre ; do n't expect me to read your mind . " " It is said that you have a gift for doing that . "  | He shook his head regretfully . " It does n't work with women ! " Aware that Brian was coming for him , Molloy made one last desperate effort to recruit allies . But the name of Desmond had lost its magic . His defiance of God had made him many enemies ; former friends shrugged eloquently and showed him their empty hands . With every threat or promise at his command he rode from tuath to tuath of his kingdom , waving his sword and hurling threats at Cashel , but most folk stayed indoors and barred their gates against him . Some few Northmen stood with him , but when he marched to meet Brian 's forces at Belach-Lechta he still had only a thousand men , and the full weight of southern Ireland was bearing down upon him . Belach-Lechta , near the pass of Barnaderg . A stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dalcassian had been slain ; Brian and his officers knelt there and left a gift of flowers . The two armies came together three miles beyond . When camp was pitched before battle morning , Brian rode among his men , already savoring tomorrow 's victory and anxious to see it in their faces as well . They waved to him from their cooking fires ; relaxed , confident , aware that they had twice the number of warriors Molloy could hope to field , and Right was on their side . It was a holy war ; a great man was being avenged . Sophisticated tactics would not be required to defeat the Desmonians ; it was to be a straightforward battle , a final mopping-up of the last rebels against the new rule in Munster . A good , clean battle . Something prickled at the back of Brian 's neck , some atavistic-instinct warning him of the unexpected . He reined in his horse . His escort , led by Fergus and Reardon Bent Knee , pulled up behind him . " What is it , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... when things seem to be going too easily , watch out . " He raked his keen gaze over the  | spread blanket of his army , row upon row of seasoned warriors . It was a sight to reassure , not alarm . And yet .. . An officer 's tent , pitched in the center of a company of men , rippled slightly over its surface with a passing wind . A young face , a page perhaps , or a body servant , glanced out briefly and then ducked back . Sitting on his horse , Brian froze . " Whose tent is that ? " " I 'll find out , my lord . " " It does n't matter , just bring me the lad inside there . Quickly ! " He waited , tall on his horse , his face carefully clean of expression , while Reardon trotted over to the tent and vanished within . There was a sound of voices , a brief but loud protest , and then he returned , followed by Murrough . A flushed , defiant Murrough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame and reached his knees . He stood bright-eyed before his father , his shoulders braced . " Before God , I ca n't believe this ! " Brian swore , torn between anger and amusement . " Who helped you do this foolish thing , boy ? " " I did n't need anyone to help me , my lord , " Murrough answered strongly although his voice began with a suspicious quiver . " I 'm old enough to come to fight by myself . " " But not so brave that you would do it openly , it seems . Does your mother know of this ? " " No , sir . " Murrough stuck out his chin . " I thought not . It probably never occurred to her that you were so eager to get yourself killed . I shudder to think what she would say to me if you went home with so much as a chipped tooth . You have put us both in jeopardy , boy , and I do not thank you for it . " Brian 's men were smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boy looked at each other , a generation separating them , and it was easy to see Brian 's youth reflected in his son . Even Brian recognized it , and it took a mighty effort of will to avoid being influenced by it . He turned briskly to Fergus . " Take care of this whelp , Fer-  | gus . See that he gets a look at the fighting , so that he 'll know what it 's about , but do n't let him get in the way . " He turned back to his son . " I 'll deal with you later , " he promised . The battle was brief , one-sided , its outcome predetermined . The Northmen who had stood with Molloy deserted him as soon as they became aware of the superior numbers arrayed against them , but Brian ordered a detachment to pursue and kill them anyway . " Let the foreigners learn what it costs to interfere in our affairs ! " he cried . Molloy led his men in the first few minutes of the battle , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart went out of the Desmonians . The slaughter that followed was swift and harsh . Brian had given the order that men be cut down in their tracks unless they asked outright for mercy , and by the time the sun stood overhead there were hundreds dead where once the king of Munster had died alone . Molloy was not to be found . Brian raged among his officers . " He must be captured ! That man can not be allowed to live to enjoy another sunset ! " He rounded on Cahal , who had led the assault on Molloy 's right . " I thought you had found him and marked him for me ! " The king of Delvin More snarled back , " I did , but the coward threw aside his princely cloak and abandoned his horse during the thick of the fighting . By the time you got to us , my lord , no one could identify him . And then he was gone entirely . " " Damn it ! I want every Dalcassian put to the task of finding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no food eaten until I have Molloy and by God , if my own Dalcassians ca n't catch him , then I 'll spread every man here over Munster like a net until that murderer stands before me . I have promised him to my sword ! " Search parties scattered in every direction . Fergus , as one of Brian 's inner circle from the outlaw days , should have been  | leading one of the companies , but he came instead to Brian , sweat on his face and a curious expression in his eyes . " Yes , Fergus , what is it now ? " " More bad news , I 'm afraid . Your son is missing also . " There was no way to tell that but baldly ; the dreadful words spat out upon the air like arrows to wound and kill . Fergus shrank from the expression in Brian 's eyes . " You 've lost my son ? " It was well known of Brian Boru that he recognized no excuses , and Fergus offered none . " I had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him well behind the front line . He simply handed the horse to someone else and vanished . " Brian looked out in agony at the battlefield , where men still convulsed in the final act of dying , or shrieked and cried for water or mother . One of them might be Murrough . " Find him , " he said bleakly . Among the anxious searchers who fanned out across the countryside was a tall man on a horse . His face was so closed , his manner so forbidding that even Padraic fell back and walked a dozen paces behind him . Alone , sick at heart , the easy triumph and sweet revenge soured in his belly , Brian moved among the dead , looking for his son . The hut was long abandoned , tumbledown , its thatched roof reintegrated with its native soil . A great weight of hawthorn leaned against it , crushing it back into the earth . No door remained , merely a crooked aperture between two sagging posts , but it was sufficient for a man to squeeze through . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gloom . The air was close , dead , with a mustiness that made  | his nose itch . Sweat trickled down his neck . It was very quiet in the hut ; even the spiders that had laced its decaying walls with cobwebs were still , as if watching him . He drew a deep , shaky breath . And then another . He felt greedy for the air that meant he was still alive . No one had seen him headed this way , running doubled over among the trees , and it would be dark in a few hours . If he was still undiscovered by then , it might be safe to try to complete his escape . But not by going home  --  Boru would surely have men waiting for him there . Perhaps they were already there , tying up his sons , putting their hot hands on his wife ... he swore bitterly and rubbed his hand over his eyes . The stinging salt sweat made them itch , and he swore again . Molloy of Desmond sank down against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vermin in a pile of thatch . By looking straight up he would see a piece of blue sky . He picked at his nose , adjusted his clothing , ran through various plans in his mind and discarded them one after the other . The defeat was total ; there could be no doubt about that . All Munster would accept the Dalcassian upstart now , it would not be possible to put together a force large enough to drive him out , even if the Norsemen and the Danes could be convinced to take part in such an attempt . Which looked highly unlikely . He sat and thought about defeat . Something moved outside ; something too large and heavy . It crashed through shrubbery and then reached the collapsed door , breathing heavily . Molloy 's hand was on his sword hilt and he held very still , trapping his breath in motionless lungs . Someone squirmed through the opening and into the hut . Molloy almost laughed aloud . The newcomer was only a large child , a boy who surely had no more than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed , his black hair tangled with twigs , and when he saw Molloy he started . The prince of Desmond got to his feet and bowed with sar-  | castic silken courtesy . " If you 've come for hospitality I can show you little , good fellow , " he said . " I 'm new here myself . " The boy circled him warily , looking him up and down . " Who are you ? " he asked . Just a soldier who got tired of fighting , " Molloy answered casually . " This looked like a quiet place , out of harm 's way , and I thought I 'd stay here until it was safe to go home . " " You 're a deserter , then . " " You might say that . What about yourself ? You look too young to be a warrior . " " No , I 'm not ! " The boy straightened to his full height and tossed his head , flinging aside a tumble of raven curls . " I 'm old enough to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man ! " " Ah-hunh . " Molloy edged sideways , trying to get the boy to follow him into the shaft of light that pierced the ruined roof . The lad looked well nourished and well dressed  --  ah , yes , when the light struck him it was obvious he had a noble 's face . Some important family would pay a good ransom to get him back . Perhaps enough to buy passage to the Cornish coast , and bribe the Munstermen to look the other way . Molloy spread an ingratiating smile across his face and held out his hand . " Come closer , lad , I wo n't hurt you . " The boy took a step backward , shaking his head . " It 's glad I am to have you here for company , my man , " Molloy continued , trying to edge closer unobtrusively . If he could get a hand on the youngster , tie him up with something .. . Murrough watched the man 's eyes above the dark beard . The lips were smiling , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back slowly away from him , and with one hand he sought beneath his tunic for the knife hidden there . He had been holding Fergus 's horse , chafing with impatience and enduring the cramped muscles of one who has stood too long on tiptoe as he craned to watch the battle . And then he had seen the Desmonian slip past , cutting across the rear of Brian 's line , moving not away from those who sought  | him but directly behind them . The man wore the plain clothing of a foot soldier , but the gilded hilt of his sword caught the light and Murrough 's attention . It must be the prince of Desmond . Without thought , Murrough tossed the horse 's reins to a surprised slinger standing nearby and ran in the direction of the swiftly retreating back . While ducking and dodging through the trees , it had been exciting to imagine himself confronting the treacherous prince , capturing him alone , and handing him over to Brian in triumph . In a boy 's fancy such deeds are easily done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown and dangerous man , he began to realize the vast gulf between imagination and reality . Molloy was a skilled warrior , a big man with a heavy sword and a feverish glitter in his eyes . Murrough 's mouth went dry . There was a commotion outside . Brian 's men were passing nearby , calling Murrough 's name . Momentarily distracted , Molloy turned away from his intended victim and stepped catlike to the opening . Careful to keep his face hidden , he peered outside , trying to determine how near the soldiers were . There might not be another chance . Shaking with terror and very sick to his stomach , Murrough pulled out his knife and clasped it tightly , one hand locked over the other . Without allowing himself to stop to think , he ran full force at Molloy 's unguarded back and put his whole strength behind the blow . It was frightening , how tough that back was ! It was not like cutting into meat at all ; more like trying to sink your blade into a tree trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let loose of the knife and stumbled backward , waiting in terror for the infuriated Molloy to turn around and strike him down . But Molloy did not turn . He stood unmoving for a terribly long time , then made a strange gurgling sound , and sank to his knees , arms upraised , hands clawing at his shoulders .  | Murrough screamed , then , with all the air he could draw into his lungs . " Help ! Help ! I 'm here , I 've got him ! Help ! " And then strong hands were ripping down the flimsy walls of the hut , and Brian 's soldiers poured in upon them . By the time Murrough had repeated his story to a score of soldiers , it had changed from the deed of an impulsive child committing a rash and dangerous folly to a feat of heroic proportions . In spite of the fact that the dead prince lay on his face , a knife hilt protruding from between his shoulder blades , by Murrough 's account he had been slain in savage hand-tohand combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing every step of the way . When Murrough was brought before his father ? accompanied by Molloy 's body on a litter  --  the boy was glowing with pride and self-importance . Brian 's furious face was like a dash of icy water . " How could you do such an insane thing ! " Brian yelled , his relief roaring out of him in the shape of a thunderous rage . " You could have been killed  --  you should have been killed ! Molloy should have spitted you like a pig and had you for his dinner . Idiot child , do you think war is a game for babies to play ? " The exuberant light faded from Murrough 's eyes . " I 'm not a baby , " he said with a sulky edge to his voice . " I was old enough to kill the prince of Desmond , was n't I ? I thought you wanted him dead . " Brian struggled with the urge to put his hands around the boy 's throat and throttle him . The memory of painful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near to hatred for being made to suffer such anxiety . And beneath that , a burning , shameful resentment for having been cheated of the revenge he had promised himself for so long . It was not the sword of Brian Boru that brought Molloy down . He forced himself to look at Murrough , and remember that this was his son . " Get out of my sight , and stay out of it until we are back at Cashel , " he said in a voice rough with anger .  | He turned to Leti . " Tie his hands , if you have to , and keep him within arm 's reach at all times ! " When at last he had a chance to be alone in his tent , with only Padraic for company , Brian began to let the tension drain out of him . He leaned back against the firmly planted tentpole and stretched his long legs in front of him , crossing them comfortably at the ankle . His hands lay quietly along his thighs , palms downward , and beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched Padraic prepare their evening meal . Outside there was shouting and the singing of men well gone in drink , the sounds of celebration that follow a victory . Brian wondered why the joy of it eluded him . Mahon , he thought , the name crossing his mind as it did so often in unguarded moments . It was a spear of pain . And Murrough 's name might have been added to it , another burden of guilt . The more I have the more I can lose , he thought . The price for my dreams keeps getting higher . " I am raising him to be a king , " Brian said darkly , mostly to himself , " and he is willing to throw his life away for a moment 's adventure . He is rash and quick-tempered , but are those youthful follies alone ? Will he outgrow them when he comes into manhood , or am I wasting all my dreams ? " Padraic , quick to respond to the pain in Brian 's voice , said , " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day , I know it . He is young yet , that 's all ; there 's sturdy timber underneath . You are training him to the kingship and he will not fail you . " Above his beard , Brian 's gray eyes brooded.  | The palace of Kincora rose on the west bank of the Shannon , stone upon stone , timber wedded to timber in an embrace meant to span the centuries . When Brian could make time for it he rode up to supervise the building , suggesting a window here , insisting on a stouter wall there . The builders were surprised at his grasp of their craft , and annoyed at his insistence on perfection in the most minute details . But as the compound grew they began to take a special pride in . it . It was , truly , a house fit for a provincial king , a splendid citadel , and in the years to come men who did no more than straighten bent iron nails or tamp clay would boast to their grandchildren , " I built Kincora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free of shadowy corners . The grianan was built around an enormous , gnarled apple tree , which had been spared the woodman 's ax and allowed an opening in the roof . Cages for Emer 's songbirds were to be hung from its branches , and the slant of the trunk was inviting to the feet of small climbers . The huge banquet hall was to have two long galleries leading to the kitchens , so that a steady flow of servants could come and go without having to dodge one another . " No one has done it that way before , my lord ! " the chief builder complained , and was irked to see that his argument only pleased Brian . " That 's all the more reason for doing it , " the king said . Care was taken that light and air should reach the inmost recesses of the king 's hall , and bright colors blazed everywhere , replacing the gloom of Cashel with the brilliance of Kincora . Painted leather hangings were commissioned for the many separate guest houses and apartments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " In the spring we 'll demand an additional tribute from the under-kingdoms , if we must , " Brian told him . " I 've spent a fortune already on repairing their roads and giving them military protection ; they should n't object to a little more gold for Kincora . " " But my lord , tributes are always resented . Callachan was a frugal man , and his son after him , and even your dear brother , God rest his soul , spent nowhere near such sums as these . " Brian arched an eyebrow . " All the more incentive for me to do an excellent job as ruler of Munster , would n't you agree ? My people will have such security as they have never known , and the prosperity peace makes possible ; they wo n't resent the cost when they see how I earn it in full measure ? twice over . The first rule of kingship should be that a king is always worth his keep . " As Murrough grew , his father 's concept of kingship began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new rank , Brian had not sent his children to the monasteries to be educated , but had brought in the best of the monastic tutors to instruct them at home . The endless lessons pleased scholarly Conor , but Murrough hated them . " Why do I have to stay inside and study all the time ? " he complained to Brian . " I do n't want to be a priest-king , like my uncle , so I do n't need to know Latin and all that . I want to be a warrior-king , like you ! " " I thought like you , once , " Brian told him , " but then I learned that a man must have much knowledge and many skills to rule well , and so I have never ceased my education . " " But what does a lot of history about dead civilizations have to do with here and now ? " Murrough argued , thrusting out his lower lip in the small pout that was characteristic of him when he felt abused . " When I am king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy and all those boring things ; I wo n't need to know them . " " Every lesson is valuable , if only for the discipline it gives you , " Brian replied . " You are to be more than just my successor , Murrough ; you must be the best king I am able to prod-  | uce for my people , or my whole concept of succession has no validity . Ca n't you see that ? Besides , I think you will find , as I have , that you will have the opportunity to make use of everything you learn as life goes by . " " I doubt it , " Murrough told him flatly . The boy had spent a lifetime listening to the tales told of his father , and they were all of great deeds , not of dry books . The vast reservoir of unused energy within him bubbled and steamed ; the peace Brian had brought to Munster did not feed his active imagination . He approached his father with a project . " I want to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go looking for outlaws and Northmen , " he began enthusiastically . " I would n't get in the way , I 'd just watch , but I could be a lot of help to them , holding horses and so forth , and I could ... " " You 're still a child , Murrough , " Brian interrupted him , with the disconcerting feeling that he was hearing an echo of his own youthful voice . " And you caused enough trouble on your last military venture . I prefer to keep you at home , at least until you have a beard and a little wisdom , so that you cost me no more than you already have . " " What have I cost you ? " " I had to pay a huge fine to the family of Molloy of Desmond because of your rash deed , " Brian reminded him . " You paid the eric for Donovan 's death , too , under the Brehon Law , and I do n't remember your complaining about that , " Murrough said sullenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was costly ; the case for murder with malice is twice that for a simple killing , and in both cases it was certainly with malice . Those men were princes ; their deaths cost me a fortune in cows . " " You would have had to pay for Molloy anyway , " Murrough said . " You intended to kill him yourself . Besides , you 're the king ; no man can force you to pay . " Brian scowled . " You have not even tried to learn the Law , have you ? The king must be the foremost respecter of the  | Law , even when it goes against him , or his very land will turn lawless around him . " The rule of compensation is a good one , Murrough . Every man , from the lowest class to the king of kings , has an exact value put on his head the moment he enters the world , whether it be one pig or five hundred cows . That is his worth and can never be diminished as long as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his own efforts . It gives a man a platform of pride on which to plant his feet . " If he is killed or injured outside of a true act of war , then the guilty party must pay . If they can not , their entire tribe is levied upon until compensation to the full amount is furnished to the family and tribe of the victim . This serves us well , for each tribe controls its own members so as to avoid having to pay large fines for their behavior to some other group . " " Why do n't they just refuse to pay ? " " But that is the very strength of the system ! " Brian exclaimed , struggling to hold on to his diminishing patience . " Surely you have had this explained to you many times  --  why do n't you listen ? " Murrough planted his feet solidly and made no answer . Brian forced himself to continue in a reasonable voice . " We obey the ruling of the Brehon Law because the penalty for refusing to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands to till , no share of the cattle or crops , no access to the filidh , no armed tribesmen to protect you . Such an outlaw is one lamb , separated from the flock forever in a world of wolves . " He has no property rights , for the Law will not uphold his right to property , nor compensate him for loss . Any man may kill him without fear of legal redress , for the clothes on his back or the food in his bowl . An outlaw is outside the law . He has no tribe and no protection . His life is usually very poor , very short , and very miserable . " " You were an outlaw , once , " Murrough said . " Not really , " Brian told him . " I had not broken the Law of the Brehons , my ears were not notched , and I had not lost  | any of my rights . I was merely a rebel . " He allowed himself a ghost of a smile . " But I got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be led into byways for very long . " I still do n't see why you had to pay for Donovan , or Molloy either , " he said suddenly . " Their deaths were acts of war . " Brian 's voice was cold . " Those were acts of revenge . It is important to see the difference , since we suffer so much from our thirst for vengeance . It is an indulgence , Murrough , nothing more noble than that . I could afford it , but you could not  --  you were only a child , and you were rash and careless with your valuable life . " " I will repay you for Molloy 's eric ! " Murrough exclaimed angrily . " I will pay you for everything you 've ever done for me ! I would n't want to be in debt to a man who held it against me and punished me for it the way you do ! " Why do I bother ? Brian thought . He went to stand at the window , gazing out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread before him , bigger than the pettiness of daily living . I love this land , he reminded himself . What I do , I do for Ireland . The gray rocks of it , the ribs and spine that have been here since the Creation . Over there , where it blurs into the trees , there is a sweet curve to it that makes my heart ache the way Deirdre 's smile does . I could stand here for hours and feast my eyes on it . It is almost as if I could stretch out my palm , so , and feel it rounding against my flesh . In that copse of autumn-brown trees I might fancy I could see Fiona .. . He shook his head and wiped his hand across his eyes . There was no one in the trees . If I were to ride down to the river and sit on the bank I could smell the mud , he thought ; the decay , but also the richness and rebirth . An animal falls into the river and dies and its bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the whole mass of existence . It becomes part of the land again . When I am old and tired I will sink into the soil , too , and dissolve into the earth and be one with it . When I am but a memory it will still  | be here , and a thousand years from now men may stand where I do and see what I saw , feel what I felt , and we will all be part of the same thing . Irishmen , with a throat-aching love in them for the hills and the valleys and the singing of the water . Men whose bones will be formed from the crops they grow in the soil to which my body shall return . Brian snorted and turned away from the window . I make a lot of fancy speeches in my head to impress myself , he thought . I am a pretentious bastard . But the sweet land still lay beyond the window , beckoning . Before he returned to the problems of the day he spared it one more look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , softly . " Erin . " A tender smile lighted his eyes and spread , slowly , to curve his lips . Tara , hill of kings . And the green plain beyond it , within sight of the jumble of royal buildings and the sacred mounds where dead kings and unredeemed hostages slept together in the dark earth . Nothing disturbed the brooding peace of Tara  --  not the ceaseless traffic on the network of roads leading to it , nor the clash of battle on the sunlit plain . It was the heart of Ireland . And it was here in the year 980 that Malachi Mor , ruler of Meath , had at last forced the decisive confrontation he sought with the Dublin Norsemen . The battle over , the victory won , the jubilant young king was celebrating with his officers . Goblets and flagons were overflowing and the bonfires were piled lavishly high . Malachi was in a merry mood . " Ho there , Rone ! " he called to a newcomer just arriving from the battlefield , his splintered shield and bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the dead from Dublin identified yet ? " Rone widened his eyes . " As soon ask me if the leaves on the trees are numbered ! There are hundreds of them out there . " Malachi was stretched full length on the ground , propped on one elbow . Wiry , ruddy , with narrow shoulders and the beginnings of a pot belly , his was not a king-like figure . But an aura of energy emanated from him , quivering the very air he breathed . To be in Malachi 's vicinity was to be aware of life , of mirth and merriment bubbling close to the surface . When his blue eyes danced and his chuckle broke into hearty laughter , as it usually did , he became the center of any group , warming them like a good fire . Malachi the Great they called him , with love and affection . Malachi the Victor , today . Malachi Mor , successor to Donall , new Ard Ri of the Irish , and conqueror of the Dublin Norse . He grinned and sat up , sloshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named , you great dolt ; just see if old Olaf the Shoe is among them , will you ? He 's the one I 'm after . " " I can tell you now , my lord , he 's not , " a glowering dark Celt stepped forward to report . " It seems he did n't come up to stand against you after all ; the coward sent his son instead , and he 's safe behind walls at Dublin , enjoying that gorgeous wife of his . " Malachi 's grin widened . " Ah , yes , Maelmordha 's sister . Well , we 'll be going on to Dublin anyway to collect hostages , so perhaps we should take a look at the lady and see if she lives up to the songs sung about her , eh ? I hear she 's a spirited girl , and I do like a spirited girl ! " He glanced at the men around him and gave a broad wink , then threw back his head and laughed . The news reached Dublin before the setting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to his runners as they told their tale of tragedy . He was in full Norse armor , but a gold crucifix gleamed at his throat and a Christian  | priest stood at his elbow , hands clasped in an attitude of prayer . The torches in their holders flared and smoked , throwing fantastic patterns against the walls . " You say my son Ranall is slain ? " Olaf asked in a hoarse whisper . The runners bowed their heads . " He is . " " Killed ... at Tara ? By the new Ard Ri ? " " Yes , my lord . " Olaf Cuaran looked past them to the doorway and the courtyard , and thought of the land that lay beyond . " He was my first son , " he said at length , in a voice erased by grief . " My oldest  --  my viking , I called him . Ranall . " He roused himself with difficulty from the reverie that clutched him . " You will pray for him , Father ? " he asked the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sunrise for the repose of his soul . " Two Norse chieftains in the hall exchanged glances . " Ranall died a warrior . Odin will claim him ! " one hissed to the other . The second shrugged . " There will be a war for his spirit , then . Since the king 's converted to the White Christ he 's consigned all our souls to the Christian heaven . " " But there 's no fighting there ! No drinking , no sleeping with women ... it 's an abominable place ! Just because Olaf chooses it , that 's no reason the rest of us must be imprisoned there . " " Well , then , I suggest we get out of here quietly and be on board our ships before Malachi reaches the gates of Dublin . At least if we die in northern waters on a viking expedition we can anticipate a ride with the Valkyries instead of a wooden box buried beneath a stone cross . " His comrade gave a brief nod and jerked his belt tight . " Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chamber door was old . His skin sagged on his bones like wrinkled leather bags , empty of riches . Gormlaith did not even bother to dismiss her maid  --  it  | had been a long time since anything had passed between her and Olaf that required privacy . " What is it now ? " she asked him , irritable because he had interrupted her reading . " I thought you might like to know I 've made my decision . " Gormlaith showed him an extravagant yawn . " I did n't know you had one to make . " She stretched out her arm and indicated to the maid that she wished more scented oil rubbed onto it . " Malachi Mor is advancing on Dublin , Gormlaith . He will be here by tomorrow . " " I told you you should make more of an effort to establish friendly relations with him . " " He does n't want my friendship ; he wants control of the harbor and its trade . He knows that we have spent our strength in the effort to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick our bones . " " You Northmen are fine ones to talk about predators ! " Gormlaith laughed at him . " I see you as an old wolf ; lying on the ground with your feet in the air , begging mercy of a young one . " Olaf 's voice tightened . " I wo n't beg mercy , and I wo n't stay here and be his pawn . My plans are already made , wife . I am going to Iona to enter the monastery there , if they 'll have me . " Gormlaith whirled around on her cushioned stool and stared at him . " You 're what ? " " I 'm going to answer the call of Christ . I 've fought it too long already , and my son 's death is my punishment . I 'm going to spend the rest of my days in prayer and peace . " Gormlaith roared out a laugh as full-bellied as a man 's . " Do you hear that , Dahud ? " she shouted to her maid , a Cornish slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The terrible warrior is going to be a gentle monk ! It 's too funny ; I ca n't quite comprehend it . Are you having a jest with me , Olaf ? " " No jest , I assure you . I 've had enough turbulence for four lifetimes ; I long for the solitude of the holy isle . "  | " And what of your sons your responsibilities ? " " Ranall is dead . Malachi killed him at Tara . Harold goes his own way . As for Gluniarand , I suppose he will satisfy his belly and his loins by the easiest way , as he always has , even if that means licking the Irish hand . I expect no better of that one . " " And me ? And my son ? " There was a ghost of a smile on Olaf 's lips . " Do you want to come with me and request admission to a nunnery ? " Gormlaith gave a brittle laugh . " God forbid ! " " Then , woman , what you do with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a likely lad , but not quite a man yet , no matter what he thinks . You might send him to a noble house ... " Gormlaith began to realize that Olaf was really serious . Incredulous , she stood to face him , feeling her temper kindle . " Are you trying to tell me you mean to abandon us ? You would leave your wife and child helpless here , with an army marching on our gates ? " She was splendid in her anger , her lips curled in contempt and her emerald eyes flashing . But Olaf was not moved . I will never look on that face again , he thought with vast relief I will pray every day at the shrine of some cool and pallid Madonna , and count my blessings . " You slander yourself , Gormlaith , " he told her . " You are the least helpless of women , and if you confront Malachi I worry more for his sake than for yours . " The volcano erupted . " You clay-eater ! " Gormlaith screamed at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " You maggot-heap ! You stinking vermin ! May you taste hair in your mouth and have sand in your eyes every day for the rest of your life ! " With what remained of his warrior 's reflexes , Olaf Cuaran side-stepped the barrage of objects she was throwing at him . One heavy gold bracelet struck his shoulder and fell with a clatter to the floor , and he bent to pick it up . " Farewell , Gormlaith , " he told her , speaking calmly beneath the rising volume of her yelling . " I 'll present this as an offering to the monks of Iona in your name , and buy a prayer  | for your soul with it . " He turned away . " Or for the soul of the next man to fall into your power , " he added under his breath . Deirdre had a cough . In the beginning it did not seem serious , just the occasional hacking that afflicted everyone during the course of a long wet winter . The move to Kincora had overtired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rested and the spring came the cough would disappear . But spring came and the cough remained ; it began to sound as if it came from someplace very deep within her . She would be seized with it during meals and turn away , her eyes begging forgiveness , to strive without success to empty the phlegm from her lungs into a basin held by a solicitous servant . Afterward , when she tried to draw a deep breath there was a rattling in her chest . The physician gave her nostrums and syrups but the cough overrode them . " All those medicines taste so bad , Brian , " Deirdre objected fretfully . " I ca n't believe they do me any good when they are so vile ; they only make me want to vomit and then I feel worse . " " Take the medicine anyway , " he urged . In the long days of summer , when fresh food and the sweet produce of Thomond plumped the cheeks and brightened the eyes of others , Deirdre began to grow thinner . She picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eater , as easily thrown off her feed as a nervous horse , but now she ate almost nothing . The skin of her hands became so white and translucent the bones could be seen starkly beneath . Brian railed at the physician . " You are on ollamh , your knowledge is supposed to be the most complete in your pro-  | fession , and yet the queen is wasting away before our eyes . Do something , man ! " " I 'm doing everything I know , my lord , " the physician protested . " Well , it is n't enough ! I will have a new and better practitioner of your skills in Kincora by harvest time , I promise you that ! " Brian went to the priests , he consulted with the herbalists himself , he sent Padraic to make sumptuous offers to any physician who could come to Kincora with a cure for Deirdre . And daily the enemy gained ground . The king began to spend time on his knees in prayer . Summer faded away in a grayness and a softness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the birds going south . Formations of geese moved through the sky , their cries haunting and full of leave-taking . Brian felt a dread of the first frost that he had never known before . " Everything 's dying , " he said to Padraic . " It 's autumn , my lord ; there will be rebirth in the spring , and Resurrection at Easter . " Brian found that he could not clearly visualize the spring . So many magical returns of that season had he lived through , and yet his memory of it was blurred , unreal . He knew there would be tender green leaves and a thousand starry flowers within arm 's reach , and the wind would be warm and sweet , but somehow he did not really believe it anymore . There was a vast cold chasm between him and spring ; he feared winter with the old pagan dread , and was afraid of its permanence . He tried to find more time to spend with Deirdre . But now , more than ever before , the business of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour that did not require his personal attention , no act that could be completed properly without his supervision . He felt frustrated by circumstance that conspired to keep him from her side , and at the same time relieved that he had no long hours to spend with her , listening to her breathing . She , whom he had never been able to grasp totnlly , was moving away from him on an invis-  | ible tide , and the only sign it gave was the labored drawing of her breath . Everyone knew she was dying . There was color in her face where no color had been before  --  a red , hectic stain below the cheekbones , unhealthy against the pallid skin . Her breath was bitter , and her eyes burned dryly with fever . She tried to make a joke of it , a small , Deirdre-sized joke . " I wo n't need to put berry juice on my cheeks now , my lord , " she said to Brian , " nor those stinging drops in my eyes to make them bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always beautiful without that , " he told her , touching her hot face with the back of his hand . She no longer shrank away from his touch , even in the invisible way within herself . Her body was safe from the hungers of his , protected by the onset of its own disintegration . No desire was left in him , only a terrible sadness that burned in his belly like unshed tears . When she would no longer take food they found the only way to get any nourishment into her was to wrap her in warm robes and place her on Brian 's lap . He would share his goblet with her , a sip at a time . He never thought that the killer might move from her lips to his ; she was the one who was going away , and he would be left behind . When she had taken an amount far too small to sustain life she would give a little sigh and her head would droop onto his shoulder . " One more swallow , for my sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hurt him worse than the sound of her coughing . " Maybe later , " she promised . It became a desperate race , unnamed but recognized by everyone at Kincora , to keep her alive until spring . " If she can see the geese return she will live , " the old women prophesied . " The disease will not take her after the last frost , " someone else said . But the winter was their enemy now . It invaded the valleys with glittering fingers ; its cold breath , whistled through the hills . An unusually harsh , long winter . The insects burrowed  | deep into the soil and beneath the bark of trees , and the small animals slept on in their sleep that is the brother to death . Spring became a fable , promised but not delivered . The days at last began to grow longer , though the sun was without warmth and the light that filtered through the windows was sickly and yellow . They all told themselves that Deirdre looked stronger , but when Brian held her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his heart she had already died , and the days spent with her fading shell were agonizing . And then one evening there was a new scent in the air , a whiff of warming earth and greening grass , and the next day the sunrise was vibrant with life and the birds were singing . The children burst from the palace , unable to bear a moment longer within walls . " Take me outside too , my lord , " Deirdre asked . " Please . The little . tree beyond my chamber window looks as if it has buds on it and I would give anything to see them ! " Her maid wrapped her in a robe of wool dyed a rich royal purple , and Brian saw the color reflected in her eyes . She smiled at him . " Have I become so very old and ugly my lord ? " " No , truly . I was just noticing your eyes  --  they 're like amethysts today . " " Did I ever tell you I do n't like amethysts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always give them to me for some reason , but I 've never really cared for them . " She paused to cough and he was concerned for her , but she smiled and went on . " What I really love is massive gold jewelry  --  you know the kind ? ? barbaric ! Like that collar you brought back from Limerick . Fithir said it was too heavy for me , and my maid put it at the bottom of my jewel chest and then always took out other things instead . But I liked it best . " " I never knew that . I thought you did n't wear it because " ? he hesitated , then found he could say the words after all . Because she was dying something had changed and at last they could speak to one another ? " because it was a gift from me. "  | Had the fever not burned all moisture from her there would have been tears in her eyes . " Ah , Brian ! That was the very reason I loved it most ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away against his shoulder as he carried her out into the morning . The fresh air seemed to do her good , although the physician fussed and Brian took her back in quickly lest she be chilled . Throughout the day she coughed less than she had in months , and at dinner she ate a tiny bit of fish and a quarter of a cutting of a honeycomb . But as the shadows stretched toward evening her small vitality seemed to drain away , and at last she asked Brian to carry her to her chamber . It was always Brian she asked for now . The distance from the banquet hall to the bedchambers was not long , but because of Deirdre it was kept well-lit . Brian would allow no shadows at Kincora . As he walked with his wife in his arms , he heard her soft voice against his chest . " Why so many lamps , my lord ? Is n't that wasteful ? " He smiled down at the top of her head . " Lamps give a clearer light than torches . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamps I want , and I want as many as will give you comfort . " She shifted delicately in his arms . He could barely hear her voice . " But it really is n't necessary , " she said very faintly . " I 'm not at all afraid of the dark . " When he reached the door of their chamber , Brian Boru was alone . " This place gets less like a palace and more like a garrison every day , " Liam complained , kicking at a hound that had grown too bold and tried to snatch food from the table . " The  | bread 's not fit to eat , the chambers are filthy , and I swear there are weeds starting to grow through the walls ! " " Do n't complain to me , " Conaing told him . " Well , I ca n't complain to the king about it ! " The hound grew more insistent , and Conaing whirled around on his stool and slapped the dog 's drooling jaws . " Why not , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me , he 'll see anybody , he just does n't pay any attention . Ever since she died , talking to Brian has been like talking to a rock . You recall that Malachi replaced Olaf Cuaran with that vicious son of his , Gluniarand  --  why , I ca n't imaginc and Brian was very concerned at the time over the fact that Malachi was going to leave a Norseman with a reputation for cruelty in charge of Dublin . Messengers came yesterday when you were out with the patrol ; they had ridden hard to bring the news of Olaf Cuaran 's death on Iona , and to tell of a rumor that Malachi intended to wed the Norseman 's Irish widow . " All of those affairs would have been of great interest to the Brian we have always known and followed , and yet the king did n't even have any questions for them . He halfway listened , and then he thanked them in a vague sort of way as if they had brought no more news than a comment on the weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of our enemies ... " Corc said , " It 's a shame the lady Fithir chose to remain at Cashel ; the king always seemed to think highly of her . " " Brian needs something more than a near-sister right now , " Liam remarked . A tall man in a hooded robe of monks ' cloth leaned forward to enter the conversation . " You warriors  --  you think a woman is the answer to everything , do n't you ? " " A woman may not be the answer , Celechair , " Liam told him , " but it 's been my experience that women always have an answer . But I suppose you would n't know about that , being an abbot . " He gave Celechair a broad wink which the other man ignored . " Clerics have feelings like everybody else , Liam . Anchorites  | may take to the celibate life , and the bishop of Rome may like to think that all the clergy does likewise , but you know as well as I do that the Church in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a likely lad has followed his father into God 's profession . " Corc grinned . " And what about you , Celechair ? " " I keep my private life private . Unlike some . " The abbot sniffed . Laoghaire the Red moved down the table to get closer to the discussion . " You 're talking about women ? " he asked with a gleam in his eye . " Wait and I 'll go and get young Murrough ; that is his favorite topic these days , since his beard grew . " " We 're talking about the king , " Conaing said coolly . " Oh . That 's another problem . " " Yes , and one that must be solved soon , or all Munster will suffer . " Padraic , who sat throughout the meal with his eyes downcast and his hands on his food , slipped quietly from his stool and left the hall . He found Brian sitting on a stone outcropping overlooking the river , his harp lying forgotten in his lap . The gray eyes glanced without interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " Brian asked , uncaring . " There is talk in the hall , my lord ... " " There is always talk in the hall . " " Your men are worried about you . " " It 's not necessary . " Brian 's fingers touched the strings carelessly and the little harp made a strange , discordant sound . Padraic tried again . " They say the year of your grief has ended , my lord , and they would be relieved to see you rouse yourself from it and consider some of our problems  --  call a meeting of your council , perhaps . " Brian would not look at him . " What problems ? " " Our position in relation to the other provinces , for one . You 've brought such prosperity to Munster that both the el-  | ders and the army fear invasion . Leinster has always been inimical to us , and then there 's Meath ... Some say that now that Malachi is Ard Ri , he may undertake to enrich his own home province at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small sigh . The never-ending conflicts could not be resolved ; they just grew more tedious . Seen from the remote viewpoint of a height above the river , it was all like the scurrying of ants in tall grass . What difference would it make in a hundred years ? Everyone would be dead , the dreams forgotten . Or not dead  --  otherwise  --  otherwhere ... He began speaking in a faraway voice . " You know , Padraic  --  the Druids believed that nothing was ever lost , that every raindrop and rose petal contained its own tiny spark of immortality , and would continue without end in some spiral of existence . They did not believe in death , those practitioners of the Old Religion ; they merely believed in a change of condition . " The priests tell me Deirdre is at peace with Christ , and yet I find greater comfort in the belief of the Druids . It would hurt less if I knew her tender spirit continued in the world , even if it 's a world I can not see . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or in another room  --  anywhere , so long as she still is . " I never really got to know her , Padraic ; I always thought there would be time for us in the future , when I had made everything else right . But there is no future if Deirdre is dead . " " If she is dead ? " " To go to heaven , out of this world altogether , one must die . But in the Old Religion there was no such thing as death , merely a passage into another existence , hidden from us by the thinnest of walls . It was believed that it was possible to pass back and forth between those worlds under certain circumstances . The ancient priests believed they could communicate with those in other life forms ; they could speak to their gods , and bring messages to the living from the not-living . " They did not fear death because it was not an insurmountable barrier to them , and they were somehow attuned  | to a larger scale of existence than we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries . . . " " Of course we have , my lord ! Even to suggest such things is blasphemy ! " " Is it ? " Brian asked . His face was haggard , his eyes were glowing coals sunk deep in their sockets . " Or is the blasphemy the fact that we have become less godlike and more mortal ? " I 've tried to find comfort in the Church 's teachings , Padraic , for I am a Christian and I believe in the way of the Lord . But it seems that I believe in something more , as well , and I no longer assume that one is the negation of the other . I suspect the forbidden religions had part of a secret we have lost , and as long as we refuse to admit its existence we are like blind men , shut off forever from the reality of our world . " Like the Druids of old , I do not want to believe in death . But ah , Padraic ! I find I no longer believe in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad about to meet his sweetheart in some hidden glade . He walked with a firm step but a thumping heart to Gormlaith 's chamber . At his heels a page trotted , carrying a whole basketful of jewelry , and as Malachi neared her door he took a quick mental inventory of his offerings . Too small , too common ! Beside her brilliant eyes and flaming hair they would pale into nothingness . She would laugh at his gifts and throw them in his face . But it was too late to exchange them , for her maidservant stood at the entrance , smiling and bowing them into the room . " Malachi Mor , Ard Ri of all Ireland , king of all the kings ! " the page announced in a squeaky treble . Gormlaith reclined on a padded bench , her body propped against velvet cushions and swathed in glossy furs . But nothing could hide the beauty of the woman . Looking at her , Malachi realized that her pose was carefully arranged for maximum impact , a studied selection of line and curve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did not resent it .  | How could you resent a woman who was , so totally , Woman ? " Malachi , " she said in her husky voice , extending one jeweled hand to him . Gormlaith did not rise , even for the High King . It was a statement of her own power . He took the box of jewelry from its bearer and dismissed the boy with a curt nod . The maidservant melted away as well , bowing low as she backed from the chamber , and Malachi waited through an eternity until they were gone . Then he strode to the bench in one great step and reached for the woman who lay there , smiling lazily up at him . How fragrant her flesh was ! How cleverly constructed this gown , that somehow fell apart at the throat as soon as his fingers touched it and let her heavy breasts spring free ! There were words he had meant to say , rehearsed speeches to impress her , but she offered herself to him so totally and with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing to do but touch , taste , feel , rub , thrust .. . Gormlaith squirmed away from him and sat up . She smiled at his hoarse breathing . The Ard Ri was not a handsome man , unfortunately , but he was a beautifully lustful one ! The hot light in his eyes warmed her from her erect nipples to the aching valley between her thighs , and the smile she gave him in return withheld nothing . Nevertheless , she planted one square white hand against his heaving chest and stiffened her arm between them . " You 've waited so long , my lord  --  surely you can control yourself for a few moments more ? " He read her right . This was a lady who demanded the loss of all control ; a dangerous thing in a woman , but what a joy it would be to surrender to it ! " Gormlaith ! " he cried , grabbing for her . The warmth was gone from her voice in the blinking of an eye  --  a cold emerald eye , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage boy taking liberties with the nobleman 's wife . " Wait , I said ! " Gormlaith demanded . She put all the power at her command in her voice , making it ice , making it iron , lashing him with it , and watching intently to  | judge the courage of his response . Olaf Cuaran , that crumbing old man , would have backed away and stood blinking at her like some great fish out of water . Malachi did not back away , nor did he blink . He held himself absolutely still , trying to measure her as she measured him . He was aware of the erection thrusting against his tunic , a foolish lance forward-tilted for an engagement that might never take place . He would hate her if she looked down at it , but she did not . Their locked eyes held . " Why wait , lady ? " he said at last , controlling his breathing with difficulty . If she would deny him , he would deny her . Malachi had played games before . " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall tree to pick it ? " She was teasing him then , cat-and-mouse . But I am no mouse , lady , he thought , and no man enjoys this game . He made his voice as cold as her own . " Sometimes the fruit is n't worth the climb , Gormlaith . " Her eyes sparkled . " How can you know unless you taste it ? Unless you hold it in your mouth ... and run your tongue over it ... and let its juices slide down your throat ... ? " Malachi balled his fists , the nails biting into his palms , but his voice was level and calm . " It seems you mean to deny me a taste , Gormlaith is that correct ? Have you chosen to remember that you are a widow , still in mourning ? " She stuck out her pointed red tongue at him . " Ha ! You think I mourn a slack-loined old man who ran off and left me to face the conqueror alone ? " Her voice caressed the word conqueror , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , and the sheen of sweat glossing them . She watched the direction of his eyes . " They would taste salty now ; it 's very warm in here , " she told him . Her voice was a golden purr . Something twitched in his jaw , a tiny muscle into which he poured all the concentrated tension of his body . " You invited me here , lady . Your messenger brought word that you were ready to discuss my proposal of marriage , and I came in good faith . Your welcome certainly gave me no reason to suspect  | that you intended to reject me ! But now you tell me to wait , as you have told me to wait again and again these past weeks . " I 'm tired of waiting , Gormlaith , and there are other matters that demand my attention . Either your brother has sent his permission for the marriage or not ; I must know today . " " Oh , now , Malachi , do n't be angry ! I was merely having a little fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little harmless amusement to add spice to our relationship . " She drew her gown closed demurely , looking up at him through her long lashes , and patted the seat beside her . " Come and sit with me and say you forgive me . I have good news . " He sat down too eagerly , and knew at once it was a mistake when he saw the minute flicker of contempt in her eyes , but it could not be undone . Every gesture , every syllable must be weighed with this woman ! Perhaps that was what made her so exciting ; surely old Olaf had been as helpless to deal with her as a baby with a lion . But he knew he could handle her . " News from Leinster ? " he asked . " Yes , my brother Maelmordha has consented to the match , in return for your support of him in his struggle for supremacy over the entire province , and five thousand men to stand with him if he is invaded . " " Invaded ? By whom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy covering once more . " Every prince has enemies , and my brother has more than most , I fear . That 's why he has to be so careful with his ... assets . " " It 's a strange way of bargaining for a bridc dealing with the lady herself , " Malachi commented . " It 's rather like making your arrangements with the horse instead of the horse dealer . " Gormlaith laid her hand on his thigh and the fingers began a slow walk upward , pushing the edge of his tunic ahead of them . " You 'll be getting a hot-blooded mare , my lord , " she smiled at him , " sound of wind and limb and with all her teeth intact . " The flaming hair whipped past his face and dropped  | to his lap , and he felt her mouth on the inner surface of his thigh , her teeth nibbling . I am making a terrible mistake , Malachi thought . He closed his eyes . I do n't care . A small brown woman came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-concealed in a hooded cloak . " We have heard that the king is far gone in grief , " the brown woman began to explain to the guard . " I am a skilled herbalist , and I have some preparations ... " " Is this a fosterling , or one of the line of Cennedi ? " the guard interrupted her , stepping forward abruptly and trying to peer into the tall girl 's face . " What do you mean ? This is my daughter ! " Fiona exclaimed , putting herself squarely between them . " All right , all right , but you 're bringing her to Kincora to live , are n't you ? " Fiona bristled . " And why should I ? " " Why , we have had a standing order from the king that we are to take in all the blood descendants of Cennedi ; he wants to see that they are properly educated and provided for . His older brothers had sired a sizable brood among them before they died , and most of them have come to Kincora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here right now ? the abbot of Terryglass , he is now . And this girl has a look about her ... " Fiona dodged in front of him , determined to block his view . With one hand behind her back she motioned the girl away . " Well , she 's not anyone but my own child , and no one else has any claim on her ! She and I go our own way and trouble no one ; it 's just that I am ... obligated ... to try to aid the king when he needs me , in what ways I can , and ... " " The king is n't seeing anyone , " the guard said firmly . " And if he were , it would n't be some faded woods-woman . If you want to leave the lass here , though , I 'll look after her myself , and ... " " You misunderstand me , " Fiona said in a harsh voice . She  | grabbed the girl 's wrist , and the two started back down the road together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheltering woods , Fiona stopped to look back . The stone and timber walls rose in symmetrical beauty , a stout defense against sword and spear . But there were other dangers that could cut a man down and destroy him . She narrowed her eyes and focused on Kincora . There it was ; a faint shimmer of tension , white-gray , the aura emanating from the place where Brian was . The halo of grief ; leaden , depressing . With one hand she reached up slowly and felt her cheek and the skin of her face ... " some faded woods-woman " .. . Her fingertips touched the rayed wrinkles at the corners of her eyes , then drew forward a long strand of hair so that she could see it clearly . The rich brown was frosted with white . " Do men only grow , " she said , more to herself than the waiting girl , " while women grow old ? " There was a rumble of thunder over the mountains . Her daughter began to walk again , hurrying deeper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spattered on the friendly leaves . Runners came up from the south , breathless with the excitement of bad news . " Gillapatrick of Ossory has invaded Munster , raided the cattle herds near the border , and stolen everything of value that he could carry ! " Kincora was ablaze with activity . Certainly Brian would immediately launch an attack of reprisal ; volunteers came scurrying up the roads with packs on their backs , anxious to be able to tell their kinfolk , " We marched with Brian Boru ! " Only Brian remained uninterested . He discussed countermeasures with his officers in a desultory fashion , half listening , his gaze elsewhere . The kingdom he had fought to win was invaded , raped , and he could not make himself care . He saw the bafflement in their faces as they tried unsuccessfully to enmesh him in their plans . " My lord , of course you must lead us ! " Leti argued . " It 's                    @
