As for the plural-singular identity crises suffered by words like data and media , stand by ; they could go either way . <P> Such are some of the bulletins to be gleaned from the second edition of the unabridged Random House Dictionary of the English Language . " A storehouse and mirror of the language , " is how Editor in Chief Stuart Berg Flexner describes the new dictionary , and with its 315,000 entries , the twelve-pound volume amply lives up to the billing .

But RHD-II is an eminently practical , everyday reference : it is typographically crisp , its definitions are clear and brief ( sometimes to the point of spareness ) , and it offers some features that Webster 's lacks , including the dates when words entered the language and pronunciation and etymological guides at the foot of its pages .

And in addition to all its other 1966 meanings , like has become an interjection , breaking out like acne all over adolescent speech , as in , " It 's , like , ubiquitous . "
