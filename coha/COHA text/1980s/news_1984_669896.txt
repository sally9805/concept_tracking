A government report on the size of the Florida orange crop , scheduled for release today , is expected to be the lowest estimate since the late 1960s . Uncertainty about the estimate , however , pushed orange-juice futures prices lower yesterday . Although forecasts varied widely , most traders say they expect an Agriculture Department estimate of between 100 million and 110 million 90-pound boxes , down sharply from last year ' s crop of 116. 7 million boxes . The lower figure is expected because of three freezes in the past four years , which have battered the Florida trees . " An estimate above 105 million boxes will be bearish for prices and an estimate below 105 million boxes will be bullish , " said one trader . Yesterday , Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 2. 65 cents , to $1. 74 a pound , on the New York Cotton Exchange as traders cleared their positions in advance of the report . " The fact that there ' s so much uncertainty is striking fear in the heart of speculators . People who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Paulenoff , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co . Traders said they don ' t expect the discovery of citrus canker in seven Florida nurseries to affect the estimate as the plant disease hasn ' t yet been discovered in any mature fruit-bearing groves . While most of the Agriculture Department ' s estimates for the Florida orange crop in the past 10 Octobers have caused prices to move sharply by the daily allowable limit , some traders said the reaction this year may be less dramatic . Even with a small Florida crop , they say Brazil may export enough to make up the difference . " The market isn ' t as nervous as in past years . Traders used to talk about the report weeks and weeks in advance but now Brazil has more than enough juice to make up the difference . Traders have just been talking about the report in the last few days , " said Ace Daniel , a trader in the orange-juice pit of the cotton exchange . However , another trader asserted that while Brazil may export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brazil supplies most of the U.S. ' s orange-juice imports and , since 1976 annual imports have jumped from about 20 million gallons to more than 400 million drinking-strength gallons . Analysts said bad news for the crop already may be reflected in current prices . " The Florida orange-juice market has been a story of doom and gloom for some time . A low crop number of 100 million boxes isn ' t going to surprise the market , " said Paul Redstone , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York . An estimate of 100 million boxes would be the lowest since the 1967-68 crop of 100. 5 million boxes . Although the Agriculture Department makes a number of monthly estimates on the size of the Florida orange crop , the Oct. 11 report is considered the most important because it is the first estimate for the new crop , which is harvested in December and January . The report will be released at 3 p. m . EDT , after the futures market closes . In other commodity markets yesterday : CURRENCIES : Currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yen and British pound rose , the West German mark fell and the Swiss franc closed unchanged . Earlier in the session , currencies rallied after the dollar failed to rise significantly on news that the Federal Reserve System had executed matched sale-purchase agreements , which force reserves to be drained from the banking system . This puts upward pressure on interest rates , which tends to aid the dollar . But a lack of significant dollar-buying on news of the Fed ' s action prompted many traders to buy currency futures , analysts said . Later in the session , however , prices fell on continued talk that inflation is likely to remain in check in the U.S. Prices also were pressured as many traders sold currency futures to take profits , analysts said . ENERGY : Prices fell as buyers , in search of lower prices , retreated from the market . Weak heating-oil prices are reportedly leading crude oil and gasoline prices lower . Heating-oil supplies in the Northeast , where the bulk of this fuel is used , are reportedly ample as demand remains slack . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , primarily from Europe and Algeria , is being shipped to cities along the East Coast , said Walter Zimmerman , broker for E.F. Hutton . The exact amount of the cargoes is unknown , " but it ' s enough to keep product coming into the market , " Mr. Zimmerman said . LIVESTOCK AND MEAT : Cattle , hogs and pork bellies rose . When lower cash cattle and beef prices failed to prompt selling , traders bought back contracts to cover " short , " or selling , positions , boosting futures prices . Anticipation that wholesale beef prices may be low enough to stimulate purchases by consumers also helped support prices , analysts said ; the prices have fallen three cents a pound in a week to 90 cents a pound . The stronger cattle futures buoyed hogs and pork belly prices , analysts said . Traders also speculated that hog slaughterings , which have been large , may have hit their seasonal peak early . GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Corn , wheat and soybeans all rose moderately , largely because of heavy buying by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delaying harvests in the Midwest , also supported prices . In addition , " technical " factors watched by price-chart analysts prompted buying . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
