Danny Wall , the chief U.S. regulator of savings and loans , is on a bailout binge . Last week the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , whose Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation guarantees thrift deposits , said it would spend $1.9 billion to rescue 14 ailing Oklahoma S and Ls . The Bank Board merged the thrifts into six larger institutions in the hope of selling them to private investors . With the Oklahoma rescue , the agency has laid out a total of $9.8 billion in the latter half of August to salvage 45 thrifts , most of them in the financially troubled Southwest . <P> Wall 's spending spree is motivated partly by deadlines , he acknowledges . The regulator wants to expedite bailouts before the current fiscal year ends , on Sept. 30 , so that next year 's FSLIC spending will stay within the confines of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . Wall 's next rescue candidate could be a whopper : the American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton , Calif. , whose bail-out may cost $2 billion .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
