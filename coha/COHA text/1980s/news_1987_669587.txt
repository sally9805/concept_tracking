' ' I think it can get better for us , but I don ' t think it can get easier , ' ' said New york general manager Frank Cashen . ' ' Going into this season , I had six reliable starting pitchers on my roster . I ' ve already lost two for the year with injuries ( he meant 18-game winner Bob Ojeda and rookie Dave Cone ) , as well as three others who have already spent time on the disabled list. // // ' ' For us this season , it ' s going to be the opposite of last year when we started great and sort of let the machine run by itself , ' ' he continued . ' ' We won our division by 21 games in 1986 , and we know that isn ' t going to happen again . We ' re not right yet as a team , and we may have to tinker with things all year , but I still think we can win our division again. ' ' // One thing the Mets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cy Young Award winner Dwight Gooden , who is 2-1 in three starts since coming out of a drug rehabilitation center earlier this month . Gooden beat Pittsburgh and Chicago in his first two starts , striking out 10 Cubs in the latter contest , before finally losing 4-0 to Montreal Monday night . If Dwight can continue to pitch well , especially against key division rival St. Louis , all is not lost for the Mets. // With Gooden and Ojeda unavailable and Ron Darling struggling , New York ' s starting pitching over the first eight weeks of the season was a far cry from that of 1986 . The only member of last season ' s big four who has picked up where he left off is Sid Fernandez , who actually looks even sharper than a year ago with an 8-2 record and a National League-leading 2. 17 earned run average . Terry Leach ( 4-0 ) has taken up some of the slack , Seaver could help if he can regain some of his old form , and of course Darling is being counted on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still an explosive team offensively , capable of scoring runs in bunches , playing tight defense , and staying in a lot of games courtesy of its outstanding bullpen . It also has a strong motivator in manager Davey Johnson , whose tendencies to platoon certain players , depending on who is pitching for the opposition , are right out of Casey Stengel ' s book. // Recently Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez told reporters : ' ' Right now we ' re in the same boat as the ' 85 Chicago Cubs and the ' 86 St. Louis Cardinals . Like us , they both won division titles and then had their pitching wiped out by injuries the following season. // ' ' No question about it , to win again we somehow have to adjust to that problem , ' ' he continued . ' ' We can ' t afford to lose many one-run games , and we can ' t ever let ourselves get too far behind in the standings . Maybe the best thing we ' ve got going for us is the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // One report circulating now is that Houston fireballer Nolan Ryan , who began his career with the Mets in the mid- ' 60s , might be available after the All-Star break in mid-July . The prospect of such a deal prompts the recall of other situations in which names like Hank Borowy , Johnny Sain , and even Grover Cleveland Alexander , all late-season acquisitions , won important games for their new teams down the stretch . <> <> Casey at the ready // Major league baseball ' s Peter Pan this season is a 26-year-old rookie with the Montreal Expos named Casey Candaele ( pronounced Can-DELL ) , who is not your usual jack-of-all-trades. // Casey ' s 5 ft. 1 in. mother ( Helen Callaghan was her maiden name ) is still more famous than he is , having been a star in the 1940s and ' 50s in the All-American Girls Baseball ( as in hardball ) League . Recently , a documentary was filmed about her. // ' ' I never saw Mom play , but Casey is one tough young man when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former major league manager and current Montreal coach . ' ' Every year this kid has gone to spring training , he ' s had to win a place on the team , even though he always played well the previous season . It was like the manager always thought he could find someone better , only by opening day Casey would be back somewhere in the lineup. // ' ' While he is a young man who might not hit quite well enough to ever be a big league regular , you can put him any place in your infield or outfield and he ' ll do the job for you defensively , ' ' Winkles continued . ' ' But what separates Casey from most guys who can play several positions , but aren ' t always sure where to throw the ball or where to stand when it ' s time to take the cutoff throw , he never makes a mistake in those areas . Someday he ' ll make a wonderful manager or coach. ' ' // Already this season the 5 ft. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all three outfield positions . He also had one 13-game stretch when , as Montreal ' s leadoff hitter , he batted . 370 . <> <> Elsewhere in the majors // *Rickey Henderson of the New York Yankees , probably the best base stealer in the American League , was telling reporters how he used to rely strictly on speed until Davey Lopes became one of his teammates . ' ' During the three years ( 1982-84 ) Davey and I were together in Oakland , he taught me a lot about how to read pitchers ' motions so that I could get a quicker start , ' ' Rickey said . Lopes still holds the National League record for consecutive steals without being caught , with 38. // *Fred Lynn , the man a lot of people thought might become baseball ' s best player after winning the American League ' s Rookie of the Year and MVP awards in 1975 with Boston , still can ' t seem to play a full season without getting hurt . In his last two years with Baltimore , Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean ? Well , the Orioles were 54-49 last year when Lynn started for them , and 19-40 when he didn ' t. // *From outfielder Mookie Wilson of the New York Mets on why he chose to be married at the ballpark : ' ' My wife wanted a big diamond !
