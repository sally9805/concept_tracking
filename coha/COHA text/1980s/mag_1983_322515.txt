Matthew Broderick is biking to stardom <P> There are several reasons for Matthew Broderick to celebrate 1983 . He won praise for his first movie , Neil Simon 's Max Dugan Returns . He received absolute raves , as well as a Tony nomination , for playing the adolescent Simon in the dramatist 's autobiographical hit , Brighton Beach Memoirs . " To Matthew , " says a note from Simon on the actor 's dressing-room wall . " After watching me on the stage , I never knew I was so cute and so talented . " Critics are already applauding his portrayal of the computer genius who nearly starts World War III in War-Games , which could easily become one of the summer 's blockbusters . Broderick 's agent has already jumped his asking fee from $50,000 a picture to a round six figures-$750,000 . <P> All of that , of course , is very nice and much appreciated by Broderick , who turned 21 in March .

" It cost $700 , has 15 speeds , with wires in odd places , and it floats on balloon tires that would make an ascent up Everest seem like a jaunt through Central Park . " You can go off the curb or hit a pothole , and you do n't even feel it , " boasts Broderick . " It 's like a Cadillac . It 's the most expensive thing I ever bought , and I did it on the spur of the moment . I asked Elizabeth Franz , who plays my mother in the play , if I should buy it , and she said : ' Why not ?

" <P> Such wide-eyed enthusiasm has prompted one of Broderick 's colleagues to remark , " Matthew is really 21 going on 15 . " Or perhaps 50 : he is a fascinating combination of young and old , innocent and wise . " From the minute he was born , he was almost the most grownup member of my family , " says his mother Patsy . " He 's very commonsensical , and he 's got a very strong ear for what is going on in a room . He can read people just right . He started off savvy . " <P> His father was the late James Broderick , a fine actor and the star of the long-running TV series Family . Patsy is a playwright turned artist , and there was almost always someone interesting for Matthew and his two older sisters to talk to in their big four-bedroom apartment , overlooking Washington Square in Greenwich Village .
