At sunrise every morning in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale , the Shanker family gets ready for work . Steven Shanker , 37 , and his wife Avima , 35 , wake their two sons , Elan , 5 , and Dannel , 2 , for a hurried breakfast of cereal and orange juice . After the meal Avima heads off by 7:30 to her job as an engineer at Librascope , a computer firm . Then , as other pinstriped parents up and down the San Fernando Valley march out to their cars with groggy children in tow , Steven , a vice president at Union Bank in nearby Monterey Park , drives the boys to their day-care center , where he will pick them up again at 6 p.m . <P> Millions of American working couples must scramble every day to arrange care for their children . But the Shankers have one big advantage over most parents : the day-care center is at Steven 's office . Union Bank provides $150,000 a year to subsidize the complex , which includes spacious play areas and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month to put his boys in other local day-care facilities of comparable quality , he pays the bank only $520 through convenient payroll deductions . Moreover , the arrangement allows him to avoid paying taxes on the portion of his salary that goes to child care . The best part , though , is that Shanker can walk downstairs at lunchtime to visit Elan and Dannel , and is nearby in case of emergency . <P> Union Bank is one of thousands of firms that have grasped a basic fact of business in the era of the two-career household : when companies hire employees , families and all of their homelife headaches are taken on as well . If little Suzy goes off to day care with a cold , Dad may fret about it at the office all day . If Mom suddenly has to work late , there may be no one to pick up Suzy and give her dinner . And if Grandma falls and breaks her hip , that budget report due tomorrow just does n't seem so important anymore . <P> Instead of blindly demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ways to help ease the unavoidable conflicts between career and family . More than half of all U.S. firms provide some form of family benefits , ranging from paternity leave and flexible hours to assistance in finding the right nursing home for an elderly parent . The Merck pharmaceutical company helped start a day-care center near its Rahway , N.J. , headquarters , and permits employees to start work as early as 7 a.m. or as late as 9:30 a.m. so that they can meet family obligations . Procter &; Gamble offers workers unpaid child-care leave of up to one year , with a guarantee that they will not lose their job . American Express conducts workplace seminars on topics as diverse as pregnancy planning , family stress and elder care . Capital Cities/ABC contributes up to $3,000 when an employee adopts a child .
