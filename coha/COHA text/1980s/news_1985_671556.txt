The Boston Globe has long dominated The Boston Herald in circulation , advertising linage and even in the number of comic strips published . But The Herald , which has shown a 58 percent circulation gain and claims a similar increase in ad sales since Rupert Murdoch bought it three years ago this month , is now addressing the comics balance too. // Mr. Murdoch has announced plans to pull nine strips and two Op-Ed features , distributed by his News America Syndicate , from The Globe at the end of the year , so they can run in The Herald instead. // The Globe tried in Federal court to block Mr. Murdoch from pulling the strips , saying that the comics , including " B.C. , " " Andy Capp , " " Fred Bassett , " " Judge Parker , " " Apt. 3-G " and " Wizard of Id , " and political cartoons by Herblock were " an important factor that many readers take into account in deciding to buy The Globe rather than The Herald , or in deciding to buy The Globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political column written by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak . <> <> Judge Rules Against The Globe // The Globe contended that Mr. Murdoch ' s syndicate had not provided proper notice that it would not renew the three-year contract for the strips . But the judge rejected The Globe ' s argument , and the paper has given up the battle . Instead it has added " Kudzu " and four lesser-known strips , and has promised to add still others to make up for the coming loss. // The Herald , which still has a long way to go to match The Globe ' s circulation and revenue , also thinks that comics are an important factor. // " A continuity strip has a certain allegiance of readers , " Joe R. Robinowitz , The Herald ' s editor , said in an interview . " That ' s what starts your interest in newspapers . That ' s what Daddy takes you on his knee and reads to you on Sunday mornings. " // " For little 7-year-old Johnny Jones out in Weymouth , " he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald . Thirty years from now , that ' s what he ' ll be reading to his kids. " // Michael C. Janeway , The Globe ' s editor , made the same point . Some of the features being pulled have run in The Globe for 30 years , he said , and " three generations of our readers have followed them . We owe it to our readers to fight to keep them. " // The shift , he said , would be " in violation of the rules governing fair trade , and without regard for the best interests of the artists and writers who create these features , or for the public . " <> <> ' Not a Slap at The Globe ' // In a statement , the chairman of News America , Robert E. Page , said , " This decision on our part is neither unusual nor intended as a slap at The Globe. " // Partly to trumpet the switch , The Herald last week brought to Boston the artists of three of the strips : Hank Ketchum of " Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Fran Matera of " Steve Roper . " They visited hospitalized children , signed autographs and appeared at a Christmas party for 1 , 000 disadvantaged children at City Hall , where they gave away red balloons that said in white letters , " Boston Herald . " The paper has also increased its visibility through other events , like co-sponsoring concerts on the Common last summer. // The comic strip war is the most direct clash to date between the city ' s two daily papers , but The Herald has been gaining ground steadily since the Hearst Corporation , which owned the paper before Mr. Murdoch , threatened to close what was then known as The Herald American because it was losing so much money. // The Herald says its daily circulation within the city limits is now 78 , 000 , about equal to that of The Globe . <> <> Disparity in Circulation // The most recent Audit Bureau of Circulation figures show an average daily circulation of 355 , 000 for the six-month period that ended Sept. 30 , and The Herald says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper three years ago , the circulation was given as 228 , 000 . At various times the paper has reported circulations as high as 420 , 000 , generally when it was running cash-giveaway games. // The Globe , which has shown a slight loss in daily circulation in recent months but steady growth on Sundays , is still far ahead with a daily circulation of 509 , 000 , according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation ' s Sept. 30 figures . Those figures show The Globe just shy of 800 , 000 on Sundays , as against 282 , 000 for The Herald. // The Herald contends it has made small inroads in The Globe ' s advertising lead , saying that it captures 21 percent of the ads that run in the two papers , up from 15 percent three years ago . The Herald says it is expecting ad sales this year of 906 , 000 inches , up from 538 , 262 in 1983. // The Herald lost $3. 5 million in the fiscal year that ended on June 30 , according to Mr. Robinowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has increased the newsroom staff , which was cut to 100 from 125 when Mr. Murdoch bought the paper , and is now 140 , Mr. Robinowitz said. // The Globe , in contrast , has an editorial staff of 400. // " We ' ve become a much more relevant product for this market , " Mr. Robinowitz said . " The profile of the Herald reader is younger , better educated , with more spendable income . All the time we ' re doing things in the paper relative to life styles and the needs of those people . " <> <> New Sections in The Herald // He points to improved entertainment coverage and new sections covering real estate , automotive news and business , and a strong concentration on city news. // Parts of the paper ' s comeback strategy would be familiar to readers of The New York Post , also owned by Mr. Murdoch . It shows a lively interest in crime and corruption , and has held to a conservative point of view on the editorial page . It instituted a " Tic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s editor , Mr. Janeway , said : " Anything that ' s good for print journalism is good for The Globe . Healthy competition in a good market is good for print journalism. " // " Fifty-five percent of their new readers are our readers , " Mr. Janeway continued . " These are second buyers . They ' re reading The Globe and picking up The Herald for amusement . I call that a healthy market. " // The Globe has prospects for steady growth , he said , despite the loyalty of readers to well-established papers in cities around Boston like Quincy and Lowell. // The Herald already runs 16 comic strips , including " Peanuts , " " Blondie " and " Beetle Bailey , " four single-panel cartoons , five word games and a trivia contest . The Globe now runs 20 strips , and will retain such popular comics as " Doonesbury " and " Bloom County. " //
