With its new Pavilion for Japanese Art , which opens to the public this week , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( LACMA ) has risen from architectural hodgepodge to full-blast cacophony . Where but in Tinseltown could you see such an overlay of styles ? First , the flaccid institutional moderne of the original buildings designed by William Pereira in the early ' 60s . Then the deco-ish hulk of stripes and glass blocks shoved in front of it by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in 1986 . And now the only major public building by America 's maestro of post-Wrightian , off-the-wall kitsch , Bruce Goff . <P> Goff died in 1982 at 78 . The design was finished by his disciple Bart Prince , to whom the urban fabric of Los Angeles owes some gratitude : the green bulk that rises beside the La Brea Tar Pits has been toned down from Goff 's original sketches . It no longer flaunts pseudo-Aztec mosaic panels ; its tower , which looked like a Hawaiian chief 's headdress clapped on top of a random-rubble grotto , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles , like sequins , that were meant to encrust its inside columns have been replaced by cream plaster . Connoisseurs of Goff will also miss the grace notes of his other buildings : no orange carpet on the roof , no replicas of Zen sand gardens done in furnace slag and fused bottle glass . By Goff 's standards , this is almost a rational building  --  essentially two cells of galleries anchored by towers sheathed in green quartzite , their circular roofs slung on cables from structural frames whose horns resemble torii , or Japanese temple gates . <P> One cell holds the offices , the bookstore and galleries containing material from both LACMA 's own Japanese collection and a superb group of netsuke ( the carved and ornamented toggles that make up a whole category of miniature sculpture in traditional Japan ) given to the museum by the San Francisco collector and scholar Raymond Bushell and his wife Frances . The walls are pleats of white translucent plastic made to look like shoji , or paper screens , which filter daylight to the galleries . <P> The floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramps reminiscent of Wright 's spiral in the Guggenheim Museum , hung above black water-filled moats . At each level are two tokonomas , large niches in which paintings from the Shin'enkan Collection can be hung . This collection is the core of the pavilion . It consists of some 300 screens and scrolls from the Edo period ( 1615-1868 ) , assembled over the past 30 years by the Oklahoma collector Joe D. Price . In recent years , Price 's collaborator has been LACMA 's new curator of Japanese art , Robert T. Singer . The Shin'enkan is  --  with no ifs , ands or buts  --  the best collection of Japanese painting of the period outside Japan . In its new setting , Price writes in the catalog , " the art is to be experienced , not studied "  --  by natural light through the walls , as the Edo artists intended , without the spotlights that did not exist in 18th century Japan . On any given day one may see perhaps a dozen screens and a dozen scrolls hanging in the main cell of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the building cost some $12.7 million , this must be the lowest density of art per dollar in any museum in the world .
