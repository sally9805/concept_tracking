Pauline Kael speaking about the dichotomy between Hollywood and intelligence : " American films have a vitality that connects with the pace at which Americans live . Now that we ' ve become educated we want to get away from that ( connection ) . We think it ' s vulgar . We react to ( a director like ) Fassbinder . It ' s safer . " We were lunching at the Ritz yesterday . Kael was in town to talk about her latest book , " When The Lights Go Down , " ( Holt , Rinehart and Winston ) , a collection of her writing for the New Yorker magazine for the past five years and a confirmation of her reputation as not only the most distinguished film critic we have but one of the most interesting , provocative and stimulating writers as well . Given the reputation , it seems ironic to have to report that placing Kael professionally is not an easy matter . Her departure from the New Yorker to produce movies for Warren Beatty is a fascinating story that may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine . " I will write for them again , " she says , scrupulously avoiding specifying in what capacity . She speaks with nothing but affection for Beatty , a friend of l5 years and dismisses all the gossip about her Hollywood experience as nothing more than " a lesson in journalistic tactics . " " The gossip was that I was going to show them how to make movies , " she said . " I ' m not a fool . What I wanted to find out was why they ' re so bad . " And did she ? " I now know more clearly the details , " she said . " I know how their personalities affect the judgment of the studio executives . The executives are bright businessmen . They don ' t care about movies . If they did , they wouldn ' t be in their jobs . " What ' s terrible about movies today is what ' s terrible about the country . The executives who used to be praised were the ones who took chances . Now it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Alien . ' You don ' t even have to be smart to make Alien . ' All you have to do is confer with your own marketing division . If a blindfolded studio executive picks 20 projects out of l00 on his desk and two of them turn out to be hits , he ' s a genius . He ' s interviewed in the New York Times where he talks about how he learned to trust his instincts - he realized that all people wanted was entertainment . " I asked Kael if there were any movies she would have liked to write about since she stopped writing for the New Yorker . " I would have liked to review Richard Pryor Live In Concert , ' " she said . " It was a sad thing that the white audience wouldn ' t go to that film .

" I would have liked to have written about Breaking Away . ' There ' s something really there in that film . I love a film that has a light surface when there ' s depth there . I hate a film that ' s deep on the surface . Like Interiors . ' " " I like Woody ( Allen ) . I talked to him the other day . He ' s trying to be Bergman and Chaplin both , which I think is a mistake . He ' s trying for depth within comedy . But when Woody tries to be serious he becomes banal . Some of those jokes in Bananas , ' like the one about the two Christs fighting for a parking space , are the best things he ' s done . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
