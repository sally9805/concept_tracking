txt Q  --  I ordered a set of 266 pieces of Lincoln Logs from Sears Roebuck &; Co. at the end of August , 1980 . In September . I returned what I received because It was n't the 266-piece set that I ordered . I still have not received the correct set . Later in September I had written the company another letter . Then , in October I got a letter from Sears , asking me to fin out a form if I had n't received the Lincoln Logs . I returned the form two days later . Since that time I have written Sears twice . I finally received a letter on Nov. 3 , 1980 , stating that I would receive the logs by Nov. 17 , 1980 , and another letter on Nov. 6 saying that I should have already received them . I still do n't have the Lincoln Logs or an explanation of why there is another delay . The logs were to be a birthday gift and that birthday has long since past .

Q  --  I stopped and admired Tribune Tower 's beautiful Christmas decorations one Saturday . As I looked at the tree inside , I noticed the quotation about builders and buildings by John Ruskin on the Tower lobby floor near the entrance . I was unable to locate the quote John Ruskin , advocate of Gothic style at our library . Can you help me out ? E. Gauerke , Waupaca , Wis . A  --  The quote is from Ruskin 's " Seven Lamps of Architecture : The Lamp of Memory " published in 1849 . The choice was appropriate as Ruskin was a strong advocate of the Gothic style , which the designers of Tribune Tower followed . The quotation reads : " Therefore when we build let us think that we build forever . Let it not be for present delight nor for present use alone : Let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for . And let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to come when those stones will be held sacred because our hands have touched them and that men will say as they look upon the labor and the wrought substance of them , ' See ! This our fathers did for us . ' " In " The Story of the Tower , " a booklet describing the wonders of the building , the Ruskin quotation is cited as " admirably expressing the spirit which animated the builders of Tribune Tower . " Q  --  If you were not adopted . I do n't suppose you can understand the thirst to know about one 's own background which those of us who were adopted have . In my own case . I learned from my adoptive parents when I was 17 years old that I had a brother , a sister-in-law and a nephew . My brother is now dead and . since I did n't see that much of him when he was alive , there are still a great many unanswered questions in my mind .
