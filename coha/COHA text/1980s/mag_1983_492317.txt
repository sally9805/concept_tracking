O ver the years , I 've made many personal appearances . I made them for 25 years in the Washing  --  ton area , and now I 'm get  --  ting requests to make speeches and personal ap  --  pearances all over the coun  --  try . 1 do about 20 or 30 a year . At the end of every talk , one question seems to pop up in groups all over the country . " What makes you so hap  --  py ? " people will ask me . " Where do you get your sunny disposition ? " Now , even though my response is sometimes met with silence or uneasiness by the au  --  dience , my honest answer is this : I 'm happy and joyful because I believe in Jesus Christ and his teachings . I am a practicing Christian . I believe in life after death . I know that my sins ( and there have been many ) have been forgiven . I simply say that a religion offering me salvation , for  --  giveness and eternal life ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on life . I realize that when you talk reli  --  religion or politics you are treading on sacred  --  and controversial  --  ground . And I in no way wish to force my religious convictions on others . But when the question is asked , as it always is , I can only respond by giv  --  ing the same honest answers . I also say honestly that I 've been blessed with many good breaks in this world . I 've had lots of love , a good home , good health and a suc  --  cessful career . But I also know that , in the last analysis , my faith is my ultimate strength . So , I want my light to shine , and I want to brighten my corner . And I prefer to let people see what I am before I tell them . Perhaps the only subtle thing in my life is that I answer questions about the sourceof my happiness only when asked . I 'm a Christian 100 percent . I happen to think that Christianity is the gentlest religion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't ask me what love is . Love is love . If you have to ask what it is  --  if you do n't feel it  --  then you do n't have it . I 'm sick of people who say , " Let 's analyze , let 's dis  --  sect it , let 's put it under a micro  --  scope and cut it till there 's nothing left of it . " If you do that to love , you 've missed it . The Christian faith is very simple . It 's basically a matter of family love . The whole religion is summed up in a verse I could recite since I was knee high to a grasshopper , John 3:16 : " For God loved the world so much that He gave His on  --  ly Son , so that everyone who be  --  lieves in Him may not die but have eternal life . " ( TEV ) The thing that hits home to me about that verse is that God gave a part of His own family to save the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son so that the rest of us could be forgiven for whatever it was that we did wrong and become part of God 's loving family , too . What 's more , God left a loophole big enough to put a truck through . Anyone could be part of His family . The way He set up the deal , even the worst criminal offender could , in the end , turn and make peace with God . That 's ultimate love . That 's forgiveness . To get in on this deal , you do n't have to own one single thing . You do n't have to have a ticket , and you do n't have to save green stamps . It 's not possible to buy your way in . All you have to do to be part of God 's family is to give your heart and your soul and your mind to Him . All you have to do is believe . You ca n't believe only part of it , though . The thing about Christian  --  ity is that you have to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it in broadcasting . It 's not like a Chinese menu where you take one from Col  --  umn A and one from Column B and forget the soup . You have to buy the whole deal . If you do n't believe it all , forget it . I do n't care if you do n't understand how Mary con  --  ceived without a man or how Jesus performed His miracles . Who gives a rat 's tail how it happened ? It hap  --  pened , and that 's that . My great moment of truth , when I finally bought the package plan , came when I was in my ' 30s . That 's when I stopped trying to come up with all the answers and realized that the secret to the whole thing is called faith . Christianity ca n't be outlined and explained in neat little compart  --  ments . The whole point is that it 's a mystery that will finally be unrav  --  eled when we meet the Master face to face . But here on earth , after you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunny Side continued from page 65 thing . It 's what you put into it that counts . To me , the Christian faith is a lit  --  tle bit like the Yellow Brick Road to Oz . Do you remember what hap  --  pened to the Tin Man and the Lion in The Wizard of Oz ? They had started out toward Oz in search of courage and compassion , hoping that the Wizard would give those qualities to them . But when they stood up before the magnificent and wonderful Wizard , all he gave them was a piece of paper and a little old tin heart . The courage and compas  --  sion they had been searching for had actually been developing inside them on the Yellow Brick Road . Christianity is somewhat like that . By having faith in that tre  --  mendous goal of perfect love that God set forth through his son , Jesus , we get power to give more love to others than we ever thought possible . By simply accepting God 's word at face value , we have access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world . It 's the power that gives your life dignity and happiness and produces peace in your heart . Everybody can plug into it , but most people totally ig  --  nore it . Maybe it 's too simple . It 's so obvious , everyone misses the point completely . It 's like an old vaudeville routine I used to do as Bozo the Clown . Bozo would come on stage , and a gorilla would hide behind him , aping his every move . All the kids in the audience knew the gorilla was there , and they would scream , yell and try to tell Bozo to turn around to see it . But Bozo could n't understand what all the commotion was about . " What 's the matter ? " he would ask . Then he 'd walk to one side of the stage , and the gorilla would follow right behind him . " He 's behind you , " the children would shout , trying frantically to give him the message . But Bozo still missed the point . He 'd grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and keep clowning around as though nothing were wrong . The ape was on the stage all the time , but Bozo never did find him . In real life , too , the very thing people are looking for and need is there for the asking . To find it , all you have to do is walk in anywhere // ? a closet , a bathroom , a church  --  and drop to your knees and say , " Here I am , God , do with me as you will . I believe I love you . I know you love me . You wo n't steer me wrong . I can do it now . You can help me do it . " But a lot of people are either too proud or too scared to take this step . We think we 're so enlightened , sophisticated , advanced and clever that we do n't need anybody but our  --  selves . We do n't believe there 's anything that we ca n't do or that ca n't be done for us through tech  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical research , but not one iota for any research on how the kind of faith that I 'm talking about affects man 's mind , body and spirit . How many half-sick people are walking around who only need one medicine to get well : a shot of " Dr. Jesus . " He was the one person in all of history who showed us all how we could get the most out of life . What He preached was not some namby-pamby little goody-two-shoes mes  --  sage only good for Sunday and your new Sears ' suit . He was n't talking about some life in the future where you 'll be by and by . He was talking about your everyday life , here and now . His whole thing was people , and how to relate to them . He showed us that the opportunity to show love is everywhere . It 's there in the nursing home with your grandfather who is waiting to die ; it 's there with your boss , your wife , your kids . And it 's there with the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My image of Jesus is completely opposite from the way he 's depicted in the movies . Somehow , he 's al  --  ways an ethereal , emaciated soul with an incredible wild-eyed look who more or less floats around with a flowing robe around him . I see him as a big man , a very giv  --  ing , physical person . My Jesus is more like Robert Morley , the jovial British actor who does commercials . The way I picture him , he 'd prob  --  ably yell , and he 'd like jokes . May  --  be he was short and kind of balding . All I know is , he must have been a real outgoing guy . He loved parties and always showed up . If he walked on earth today he 'd probably be on the " To continued on page 97 // peace they 've been seeking . Everything else falls into place when people find something worth committing themselves to . They can do almost anything ; they can pay any price . It sounds simple , but in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing bridges , leaving something familiar behind to leap into some  --  thing unknown . Yet this is why commitment is of such importance . Without it , the fears and apprehen  --  sions about changing lifestyles or careers would be too overwhelming . That one quality can make all the difference . There are two kinds of quali  --  ties  --  outside and inside . Outside qualities you can obtain through learning . Inside qualities you must develop from experience and such living , intangible things as faith and hope . Commitment is an inside quality . You may have to look in  --  side for it , but it 's there when you 're ready to make the decision and de  --  vote your closest attention and best efforts to it . The line between failure and suc  --  cess is so fine , we 're often on the line and do n't even know it . It 's im  --  portant to realize that our " inside " qualities  --  or the lack of them  --  can be responsible for the way we go . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , what difference does it make ? When you have it , you 'll know it 's there . So will everyone else.A Sunny Side continued from page 89 day Show " because he used every vehicle of his time to reach people . He showed up at the temple , the marketplace and the well , which in those days was the place you could meet everybody in town . He was show-biz . Once he was ready to reveal himself to the world , he rarely did anything in secret . He raised Lazarus from the dead in front of a whole town , not in a closet somewhere . The way I see it , Jesus must have had something awfully good to sell , because nobody would have left a good carpentry job to go out and walk the streets for nothing ! He must have had something he thought everybody would be hot to get hold of . But like most folks today , many of the people in Jesus ' time thought he would have been better off build  --  ing cabinets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though they needed it desperately . Now , suppose he had tried the hard sell and put a fat price tag on his product , guaranteeing delivery of salvation , offering life after death and promising to wipe out all the problems of the world . People would probably be they 're just as true for the modern guy who lives in an air-conditioned 18th-floor apartment , has had a vasectomy and has 14 girlfriends he services as a bull does a herd . We think we 're so liberated and that we 're free to do anything we want . But none of this liberation business is new . We did n't invent sex ; we did n't invent sin . I mean , back there in Sodom a guy shacked up with somebody 's wife , and then over in Gomorrah they got drunk and were probably shooting mor  --  phine or whatever it was they did then . It 's all been done before . But then , somewhere down the line , the unwritten code of right and wrong came to the surface . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't keep doing this , because I do n't sleep at night . Why falling all over themselves to sign on the dotted line ! All these women in their fur coats and $7,000 Gucci bags and the guys with the dia  --  mond pinky rings would be standing in line to get in on the deal . But Jesus was giving it away for free . What He was trying to tell us  --  and still is  --  is that God is offering us a great deal . I mean , God made this fantastic world and everything in it . He 's given us 7-Elevens , Big Macs and the Super Bowl . He 's given us everything , and all He asks in return is that we stay away from a few cookie jars . In other words , all He asks is that we live by a few simple rules that are set up not as a punishment , but as a way to reach inner peace . To me , it 's all summed up in the First Command  --  ment : " You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one of the Ten Commandments that is really worth anything . The others are all things that you do when you 're out of whack with the first one . But putting God first in your life  --  before money , power , fame , and anything else you hold dear  --  is the greatest challenge . It also brings the greatest rewards . When you make God No. 1 , you are acknowledging a source of power greater than you . In return you get the incredible strength of knowing you 're not alone . Now , you may argue that God 's rules were made for a nomadic people who lived 2 thousand years ago and do n't apply today . But I saydo n't I sleep at night ? It 's because I 'm sleeping with somebody else 's woman . I 'm having a ball , but some  --  thing 's wrong . " And then one day a friend says to him , " You know what 's wrong . Your conscience bothers you . " " What 's my conscience ? " asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's causing you not to sleep at night . " " What do you do about that ? " asks the insomniac . " I do n't sleep with an  --  other man 's woman . " So the guy goes out and for six months sleeps with his wife and no one else 's . Afterwards , he runs back to tell his friend , " You know , I have a little self-respect , and now I can sleep nights . " Deep down inside , we all know what 's right and wrong . What 's more , we all want to be part of the love that God has for us . For us to willingly separate our  --  selves from this fantastic deal he 's given us seems almost inconceivable . And yet , like Adam and Eve , we do just that . We quickly succumb to the evil forces always there to tempt us . But to have a chance at God 's perfect love , you have to be on your guard all the time , because there 's something out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you will , but I call it the devil . He 's real , and he 's waiting for us to slip up . I see things in simple terms . To me , life is a lot like a garden . You ca n't go continued on following page and leave a garden more than a week at most . If you do , things get into it : slugs , fungus , weeds . The earth gets too hard ; it ca n't absorb moisture and the plants die . The same is true of your faith , your children , your marriage and everything of value in this life . You ca n't leave anything to chance or take anything for granted . Once you 've embarked on a course , it has to be constantly cared for to be pro  --  ductive and fruitful . It 's got to be such a part of your life that you have to give it constant attention . One way I try to keep my garden tended is through prayer . Every single day I start out by thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for love . I 'm thankful that I 'm alive and thinking . And I 'm thankful that life has love and the potential to ex  --  change affection and sentiment and feeling and compassion with other people , because people are the most exciting things in the world . I end up my little prayer session by saying thanks for my family and friends . Just starting the day thanking God for the simplest things gives me a lift . I pray anyplace  --  in a cab , on a plane or in the barn with the cats . You do n't have to throw yourself on the ground and go into great convulsions of praying . All you really need is one verse , Psalms 118:24 : " This is the day which the Lord has made ; let us rejoice and be glad in it . " ( RSV ) The simple act of being thankful every day of your life makes you constantly aware that doing God 's work is the most important thing in the world . It makes you aware that there 's more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tle desires , and that you really do n't have to worry about anything because God 's going to take care of it . Things may not always work out the way you ex  --  pect them to , but in the end you 'll come out ahead . Letting God take charge does n't mean that you give up on the everyday battles , or that there are n't mo  --  ments and problems . It just means that there is an alter  --  native offered to you , a way out if you are willing to look for it . I 've seen it in my own life . When I 've been faced with crises or near-crises , there 's always been a new op  --  portunity offered to me by God . In some ways , my life has been like the cavalry in those Indian pictures where everybody was lost , there were only two wagons left and three shells were left in one gun . Then , at the very moment the Indians are whooping and hollering and poised to attack  --  miracle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ta , ta . " As a matter of fact , I regard my job at the " Today Show " as one of those miracles . Right before I was asked to come to New York , I had reached a point where some things in my life were beginning to build into crisis proportions . My weather job in Washington was one of them . On the face of it , I looked as if I had everything a man could ask for . I was making all the money I need  --  ed . Everything I owned was paid for . I had two great kids and a wife I considered my best friend . I had health and job recognition . After 17 years as the local weatherman , I was a star in my own right , a " legend " in my own time , as they say . Who could have asked for anything more ? Yet , all that was n't enough . My success had brought me to the point that I was bored out of my mind . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I really was n't sure what I wanted to jazz up my life  --  another woman , another job or whatever . Then I was hit with lightning . Out of the blue , I was offered a chance to be the weatherman on the " To  --  day Show . " I was sitting in my of  --  fice in Washington one day when Bill Small , then the head of NBC News in New York , walked in . I had never met the guy before , but he came right over to me and intro  --  duced himself . " I 'm Bill Small from NBC News , " he said . " Why have n't you ever been on the network ? " " Nobody ever asked me , " I an  --  swered . " How would you like to do the weather for the ' Today Show ' ? " he said . " I 'd love it , " I said . That was it . Two months later I went to New York to do an on-air audition on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas of 1979 . Not long after , I was hired as the weatherman . I had needed something to change my life , and along came the biggest break in my career . I saw it as a gift of God .
