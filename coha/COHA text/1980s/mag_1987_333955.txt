Suddenly the specter of an all-out trade war between the U.S. and the twelve- member European Community loomed larger than ever . In Palm Springs , Calif. , where President Reagan was vacationing , U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced last week that the Administration was prepared to slam the door by Jan. 30 on more than $400 million worth of West European imports , including Italian white wine , French cognac and British gin . The Europeans came right back with threatened new barriers against such U.S. products as corn-gluten feed , soy cakes , rice and almonds . Yeutter spoke darkly of possible " major disruptions in international trade . " In Paris , a French trade minister warned that Europe would respond " eye for eye , tooth for tooth . " He also accused the U.S. of " choosing the Rambo method " for resolving the issue . <P> That metaphor seemed inexact : no shots , after all , had yet been fired by either side . Even so , it seemed that brinkmanship , usually a negotiating tool among enemies , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of its important friends . The brandishing of threats and deadlines also marred U.S. trade relations with neighbors to the north and south . As the European row erupted , U.S. negotiators announced that they had solved  --  almost  --  a festering softwood-lumber dispute with Canada . Meanwhile , the Administration postponed for at least six months yet another major trade confrontation , this time with debt-laden Brazil . The trouble : stymied U.S. access to that country 's computer and information industry . <P> Why all the fuss over trade right now ? Deadlines in the various negotiations happened to coincide , but the actions also reflect continued U.S. frustration over its trade deficit . In November the U.S. recorded its worst monthly deficit ever : $19.2 billion , up from $12.1 billion in October . U.S. officials pointed out that extraordinary factors were involved , including the rush of consumers to buy imported items like autos before tax reform eliminated sales-tax deductions . Said U.S. Under Secretary for International Trade Bruce Smart : " We remain confident that 1987 will see a significant improvement . " Maybe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running at an annual rate of $173.5 billion , up 17% from the previous year . The Administration is eager to confront the trade issue before Congress decides to pass sweeping protectionist legislation . <P> The origins of the European trade dispute go back a year , to the entry of Spain and Portugal into the European Community . With that move , Spain embraced highly protectionist E.C . farm policies that included prohibitive levies of up to 200% on U.S. corn and sorghum exports . The action effectively closed those Spanish markets , worth an estimated $400 million to American farmers . Under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , a 92-member treaty , Washington demanded compensatory access to overall E.C . markets for the same goods . The Europeans recognized the U.S. right to compensation , but then refused to take action , arguing that increased U.S. manufactured exports to Spain would eventually make up for American losses .
