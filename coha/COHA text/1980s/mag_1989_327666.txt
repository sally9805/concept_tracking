Most policymakers would rather wait until the greenhouse effect and other environmental threats have irrefutably arrived before taking remedial action . Not Senator Albert Gore .

For one thing , the proposed law would replace the White House 's Council on Environmental Quality with a new body . Called the Council on World Environmental Policy , it would refocus attention on ecological problems of the planet as a whole . The bill also calls for tougher U.S. fuel-economy standards for autos and a phased-in ban on chlorofluorocarbons , the chemicals that exacerbate the greenhouse effect and destroy the stratosphere 's protective ozone layer .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
