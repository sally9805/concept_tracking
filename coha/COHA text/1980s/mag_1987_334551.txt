Can science help shrinking violets blossom ? Well , not yet . But Stanford University researchers believe they have identified a chemical key to shyness . In a study of 16 men at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Center , they found that timid types have lower levels of the brain chemical dopamine than more extroverted individuals ( as measured by standardized personality tests ) . <P> Past research has shown that abnormal dopamine levels play a role in Parkinson 's disease , schizophrenia and possibly narcolepsy , but the Stanford research appears to be the first to link the chemical to a normal personality trait . " There 's nothing pathological about shyness , " says Psychiatrist Roy King , who headed the study . He concedes that research such as his could lead to new drugs that modify individual personality , but finds the concept " scary . " Besides , he says , " society needs both extroverted and introverted people . "
