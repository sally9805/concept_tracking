The 47th race to the White House has just passed its first formal milepost , last week 's Iowa delegate-selection caucuses . Yet TIME 'S campaign correspondents feel as if they have already endured as many bad meals , standard stump speeches , lost luggage and bumpy flights as most Americans do in a lifetime . In the process of reporting for this week 's Nation and Press stories on the Iowa balloting and its implications , our " boys on the bus " paused to assess life on the campaign trail . Among their impressions so far : <P> National Political Correspondent John Stacks began covering the campaign of 1980 in September 1979 . Despite that lead time , he frets , " I may not be able to travel with all the candidates before they cease to be candidates . " He caught one with little time to spare , Republican Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota . Says Stacks : " I managed to finish reporting a story on his hopeless and misguided presidential candidacy only two weeks before he dropped out . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gate , others are astonishingly absentminded . Gate escorted Republican Candidate John Anderson to a TIME editors ' lunch in New York City . " Anderson rushed into the lobby of the Time-Life Building looking a mite perturbed , " he recalls . " He came up to me and asked for $10 , explaining , ' My bags are in the cab outside , and the driver is holding them be cause I do n't have any money . ' " Says Cate : " I lent the Congress man ten bucks , which was repaid by an aide . " <P> Like many candidate followers , Correspondent Doug Brew , our man with George Bush , has become a connoisseur of campaign airplanes . " They can be a measure of the candidate 's progress , " he explains . Before Iowa , Brew observes , " Bush was flying commercial airlines with only a few reporters along . Now the press corps numbers up to 20 , so Bush has rented a comfortable 28-seat plane . " Edward Kennedy , on the other " hand , took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chartered 727 . " On the day of the Iowa loss , the jet was grounded for lack of funds , " reports Correspondent Walter Isaacson . " Our final meal on board had been shrimp and broiled lobster . From now on it 's buses and peanut butter sandwiches . " Senior Correspondent Laurence Barrett , who follows Ronald Reagan and his team , might not mind an occasional grounding . When a spectator at a New Hampshire rally last week asked Barrett where he was from , the New York-based correspondent blurted , without pausing to reflect , " I live on a plane .
