Despite a just-ended U.S. District Court trial involving a Lyons strip joint , it seems that little has changed in the western suburb ' s steamy image . During testimony in the four-week trial of Michael ' s Magic Touch owner Michael Russo and four others , charged with conspiring to defraud the government of income from a prostitution ring operating in the club , several strippers testified that part of their job was to entice customers to buy them watered-down drinks at $6 each . Now they ' re charging $9 a drink . Otherwise , it seem to be pretty much business as usual in blue-collar Lyons , which in recent years has stripped from Calumet City and Cicero the title of the Chicago area ' s " Sin City " -a title that many Lyons residents have been fighting to shed . Their effort got a boost Friday when a jury convicted Russo , 60 , on charges of racketeering , racketeering conspiracy , wire fraud and income tax violations . Also found guilty were Russo ' s brother , August ; August Russo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marren , a doorman at the club . On Monday , prosecutors with the U.S. Justice Department ' s strike force are expected to argue that under the racketeering conspiracy charges , the property of Michael and August Russo should be confiscated . The federal indictment of the Russos and Marren and their resulting trial were intended to help clean up Lyons , which for years has been host to a string of striptease clubs in a two-block stretch of Ogden Avenue . But if the federal government and the village ' s civic reformers have cleaned up Ogden Avenue , it ' s a safe bet that no one has bothered to tell Angela . Angela works the stage and bar of what is now just called the Magic Touch , 8526 Ogden Ave. , the same saloon mentioned daily during the trial . She can be found either dancing in nothing but bright red heels , or , dressed more conservatively , sidling up to nervous-looking businessmen and other club patrons . After sitting down next to one young customer on a recent evening , she asked that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct line of questioning covering his financial and romantic status . " Virgins , " she said with a bat of her Tammy Faye Bakker eyelashes , " are my specialty . " Angela ' s place of business was one target of the ongoing federal investigation into suburban corruption , code-named Operation Safebet . In the last year , Safebet has led to the closing of three Lyons strip joints . One of those , the Petite Lounge , 8129 W. Ogden Ave. , was ordered forfeited to the government in May . Now its door is padlocked and its windows are boarded up , but its sign still promises " Continuous Entertainment Girls . " Lyons ' two remaining strip joints-the Magic Touch and , a block away , My Uncle ' s Place-don ' t just promise . They still offer nightly shows of the variety that Lyons has long been known for , much to the chagrin of many of its citizens . The Magic Touch was closed as usual on Sunday . But business seemed to be booming this month at the Magic Touch , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and where the bar surrounds a small stage where Angela and her co-workers shuffle in front of a full-length mirror . Behind the bar is a lounge area in which customers sit to snuggle and talk with women who walk up and down the bar asking patrons to buy them a $9 drink . At the back of the lounge area is a staircase . A former stripper testified at the trial that the staircase ' s landing is used for patrons to have sex with dancers . She told jurors that customers would pay from $125 to $150 to accompany her up the stairs ; afterward , her cut would be $50 . Apparently only those accompanied by one of the women working the bar are allowed to sit at the tables in the lounge . One man who tried to do otherwise was ushered back toward the bar by a flashlight-wielding doorman . Asked to explain what procedure customers are supposed to follow at the club , Angela said flatly , " This is a strip joint . There is no standard procedure here . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Judy Petrucci get their way . Petrucci is a village trustee and longtime critic of Mayor William Smith , who was named several times in testimony at the Michael Russo trial . Smith has not been officially charged with wrongdoing . Four years ago , Petrucci and others in the community led a highly vocal but largely unsuccessful campaign to close down the string of sleazy bars that had come and gone along Ogden Avenue over the years , patronized not by Lyons residents but by thousands of conventioneers and thrill-seekers who had heard that tiny Lyons was " where the action is . " Particularly , they wanted to rid the town of its bawdy image before 1988 , the year when the village would observe its centennial . This week Lyons is observing its 100th birthday with a parade and fireworks , just days after serving as the center of attention in the federal trial . At the trial , customers told how they had been enticed into running up huge bills under the promise of sexual favors , and the dancers told of the tricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the closing of three of the town ' s strip joints within the last year , Petrucci said , " We ' re very happy to see that something ' s been done . It ' s only unfortunate that it took the federal government in order to do it . " She said the trial involving Michael ' s " certainly has a cloud over our town ; it ' s very embarrassing . " But things were looking up after Friday ' s verdict . " It ' s one step closer , " Petrucci said Sunday , " to cleaning up our town. "
