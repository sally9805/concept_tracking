Just weeks after George Bush was elected President , his campaign manager and newly named Republican Chairman Lee Atwater launched an effort to lure black voters into the G.O.P. Calling for an end to blacks ' " blind allegiance " to the Democrats , Atwater talked about providing minorities with leadership positions in the Republican National Committee . He even promoted his love of black music , strumming a guitar and warbling at Washington rhythm-and-blues clubs . At the same time , Atwater  --  who cut his political teeth as a protege of South Carolina 's once segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond  --  downplayed his role in devising the crypto-racist Willie Horton ads that helped Bush win the White House . " That 's in the past , " he insisted . <P> Last week students at Howard University in Washington , perhaps the nation 's most distinguished black college , let Atwater know that the past had not been forgotten . Outraged by his appointment in January to the Howard board of trustees , more than 200 students seized the school 's main administration building in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hundreds of other students demonstrated outside , chanting slogans and demanding Atwater 's resignation from the board . Four days after the rebellion began , with riot police threatening to storm the building , Atwater stepped down . In a Washington Post piece last week he complained that the students had distorted his record on civil rights and failed to recognize the good he could do . Wrote Atwater : " I had a lot to offer Howard . " <P> Atwater 's appointment to the board was a marriage of convenience . The R.N.C . chairman wanted better ties with the black community , and Howard President James Cheek was eager to curry favor with the new Administration : the university depends on the Federal Government for more than $178 million , nearly 60% of its annual budget . Despite rumors of dissension among the 31 other trustees , all but one approved Atwater 's election . <P> Howard 's students , however , were not so willing to go along . Atwater 's appointment , declared an editorial in Hilltop , the campus newspaper , undermined " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simmered until March 3 when , during a celebration of the school 's 122nd anniversary , students stormed the stage shouting , " Just say no to Atwater ! " and " How far will Howard go for a buck ? " The siege at the administration building followed on Monday . By Tuesday , police were ready to invade with tear gas and battering rams when Mayor Marion Barry arrived on the scene and ordered the lawmen to back off . <P> Responding to scenes of the melee on the evening news and to calls from Barry and Jesse Jackson , Atwater reluctantly resigned . Most of the students ' other demands were met , including amnesty for the demonstrators . One protest leader , April Silver , exulted that the students had made an " international statement to the world . " Youthful hyperbole , perhaps , but the students had sent a clear message to Atwater and the G.O.P. : It will take more than just strumming the blues to realize their dream of a Republican " rainbow coalition .
