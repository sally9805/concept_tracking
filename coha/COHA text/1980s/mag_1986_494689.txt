As TED TURNS REMEMBER TED TURNER ? He 's the swashbuckling entrepreneur who created something like a fourth television network by bouncing the signal from his Atlanta UHF station off a satellite to homes nationwide . He 's the business whiz who made this " Superstation " profitable by broadcasting wholesome American reruns like " Leave It to Beaver . " He 's the visionary who created Cable News Net ? work ( CNN ) , the first 24-hour news channel . He 's the moralistic corporate raider who , decrying the " sleaze " and violence of big-three programming , allied himself with Senator Jesse Helms and tried to take over CBS , which Helms accused of having a " liberal bias . " Well , these days Turner 's got a different agenda . He 's a self-styled diplomat in pursuit of world peace whose credo is : " Communism is fine with me . It 's part of the fabric of life on this planet . " In the spring and summer of 1985 , while bidding to buy CBS with s5.4 billion worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union . On June 5 Robert Wussler , executive vice president of the Turner Broadcasting System and head of the Superstation , WTBS , announced that Turner 's company had signed a two-year agreement with Gostelradio , the state-controlled Soviet radio and television network , to exchange news , entertain ? ment , and sports programming . On June 12 Turner an ? nounced that he had provided s500,000 to form the Better World Society , an organization chartered to make TV pro ? grams advocating population control , ecology , and an end to the nuclear arms race . Two months later , he dropped the idea of a hostile takeover of CBS in favor of a friendly purchase of MGM /UA . ( He 's now spearheading the movement to " colorize " the company 's archive of old movies . ) Turner 's agreement with Soviet TV and his formation of a society to produce " global television programming " are part of his larger scheme to broadcast WTBS and CNN worldwide . But they also reflect his new political outlook . Turner has taken up international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to better himself . Not incidentally , he also hopes , through his media network , to better the entire world . He has traded in his posture of " save America from the scourge of network television " and his alliances with conservatives for a relationship with John Denver and earnest talk about " friendship " between the Soviet and American peoples . As he described his latest venture earlier this year , " My main concern is to . build up a global communications system that helps humanity come together . " TURNER HAS long been a zealot in search of a cause . Daniel Schorr , senior correspondent for CNN until 1985 , described his former boss in a 1985 article he wrote for the Washington Post as " a bundle of contradictions " who " does not fit any ideological stereotype " and " speaks in generally conservative terms about the economy and do ? mestic affairs . " During his bid for CBS , Turner declared ominously that " the greatest enemies that America has ever had ? posing a greater threat to our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the three television networks and the people that run them , who are living amongst us and constantly tearing down everything that has made this country great . " Today Turner proclaims , " I have a new political philosophy . I 'm a conservative liberal ; I 'm liberally conservative . " This helps to explain Turner 's 1982 duck-hunting jaunt with Fidel Castro ( " I expected Castro to be some horrible person , but he was a great guy " ) and his recent proclamation , " I happen to love everybody . Like Jesus , I 've made my peace with the Soviets . They 're not my enemies . " By beaming brotherly love across the world through television signals , Turner hopes to create a global village of U.S.-Soviet understanding . Once the American and Soviet people truly know each other , Turner has explained , they will be friends , and " nobody wants to kill their friend ? in fact , they do n't even want to hurt their friend . " More specifically , Turner thinks the arms race can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to the arms race is ' Stop it ' , the solution to the nuclear threat is ' Get rid of nuclear weapons . ' " The Goodwill Games , a two-week joint Turner-Soviet pro ? duction last summer that imi ? tated the Olympics ( which the Soviets boycotted ) , represent Turner 's most ambitious inter ? national media event thus far . He lost more than s10 million on the spectacle , and WTBS , which broadcast the games here , pulled dismal ratings . But Turner is now predicting a profit for the games when they are held in Se ? attle in 1990 . Meanwhile , he asserts that their primary goal ? getting " the main countries of the East and West back together again " ? was achieved . Actually , the games promoted mainly the official So ? viet idea of goodwill . During the opening ceremonies , Soviet au ? diences created a giant card dis ? play of Lenin and another of an American cruise missile super ? imposed with an X. Later in the broadcast , orbiting Soviet cos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms control pro ? posals . And both the American and Soviet governments man ? aged to get their political licks in : Reagan by barring participation in the games by any American military personnel ( there goes the boxing squad ) and the Soviets by reneging on a promise to let teams from Israel and South Korea compete . Those who watched the games saw the Soviet athletes trounce the Americans , and the Americans accuse the Soviets of cheating and using drugs . Turner and the Better World Society are also suffer ? ing the agony of defeat in their programming exchange with Gostelradio . So far Soviet television has n't shown any of the society 's advocacy productions . Stephen Cole ? man , director of program development for the society , says that prospects for the future are bright because Georgi Arbatov , an influential Soviet Central Committee member , sits on the society 's international board of directors . Ac ? cording to Coleman , Arbatov thinks two BWS productions that have already been shown in the United States ? " Challenge of the Caucasus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Step Away from War , " a history of the test-ban movement ? are likely can ? didates for Soviet TV . Coleman adds that BWS has re ? ceived encouragement about the shows " from key people with the authority to make decisions on Soviet TV pro ? gramming . " BWS is also considering distributing in the United States several Soviet-produced shows about envi ? ronmental problems . Turner and Coleman acknowledge the difficulty of get ? ting Gostelradio to air advocacy programs made in the West , but neither is willing to concede that the reason is the Soviet policy of suppressing non-official opinion of any sort . Coleman rejects the possibility that Arbatov and other Soviet officials are ruling out BWS programs that do n't advance the Soviet " official story . " And he argues that a " TV gap " exists . " National Soviet TV already does more to address the nuclear problem than American net ? work TV , " Coleman says , adding , " I 'm ashamed of that . " Turner has gone on the stump for BWS , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mission . In a widely reported address to John Denver 's Windstar Foun ? dation , he rambled from the subject of deforestation to toxic waste to the unequal distribution of children 's toys to an endorsement of Mario Cuomo for president . If the speech had a theme , it was this : " It was a terrible realiza ? tion for me to come to because no one loves our country more than I , but I have come to the conclusion from study ? ing it from a global circumstance that we are the greatest problem in the world . " If any of Turner 's operations can come close to advanc ? ing his dream of a global communications system , it is his news network . CNN , a widely respected news source , is already seen in 40 percent of U.S. homes , and since 1983 it has been beamed to Australia and Canada . In Europe and Japan , CNN reaches hotels , government offices , and U.S. military bases . In a little more than five years , CNN has become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already evidence that the news may have to change to suit the world ? particularly that part controlled by the Soviet Union . During the opening ceremonies of the Goodwill Games , CNN failed to report the arrest of the dissidents Olga and Yuri Medvedkov . Stuart Loory , then CNN 's Moscow bureau chief , was aware of the arrest but claims that CNN could n't get any video to accompany the story . Daniel Schorr , who worked at CNN for almost five years , says that Turner generally does n't interfere in the news operation , but that " people at CNN know he 's buddy-buddy with those people Soviet leaders and they know Moscow is his favorite place . " He adds , " I think it'sclear that in dealing with the Soviets , you have to reach a compromise on their terms . " Turner frequently explains that he considers himself " a great and patriotic American . . But I am also first and foremost a citizen of this planet . The national interest is subservient today to the international interest . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers are startled by his conversion . James Cain , the former spokesman for Fairness in Media , a conservative watchdog group , speaks warily of Turner . In 1985 Cain said Fairness in Media was " delighted " with Turner 's bid for CBS . Now he says , " There are certainly indications that Turner is not a Jesse Helms or Ronald Reagan conserva ? tive . " Don Kowet , a conservative journalist who covers Turner closely , says Turner has " absorbed too many ideas from his friends ? including Castro ? and now thinks of himself as a poor man 's Armand Hammer . " Kowet 's comparison of Turner with Armand Hammer is apt only insofar as both men , in the process of creating international businesses and amassing large amounts of money , have found it expedient to make overtures to the Soviet Union . The key difference is that Hammer 's ferry ? ing of dissidents from East to West is for his own gain , while Turner 's TV diplomacy is ostensibly to benefit his viewers . Thus it is up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative with a spin of his televi ? sion dial . As for me , I 'm skipping the 1990 Goodwill Games and tuning in " Leave It to Beaver. "
