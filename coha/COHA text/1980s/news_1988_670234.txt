It ' s this year ' s biggest movie-making throw of the dice : " Star Wars " creator George Lucas will try to bounce back from his " Howard the Duck " fiasco with a high-priced fantasy flick called " Willow . " Everything about this epic spells risk . Production costs alone exceeded $35 million  --  almost double the average major-studio film . And the May 20 release date , nearly 11 years to the day after " Star Wars " premiered , is certain to invite comparisons to Mr. Lucas ' s earlier box-office phenomenon . Moreover , unlike some new movies , which have a limited opening in New York and Los Angeles first , " Willow " will hit perhaps 1 , 000 theaters nationwide right off the bat  --  but only a week before " Rambo III " and " Crocodile Dundee II , " two possible blockbusters that will compete for top theaters and moviegoers ' money . " Willow " is also a big bet for the MetroGoldwyn-Mayer Pictures unit of MGM/UA Communications Co. , which has put up $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only recently geared up as a full-scale movie studio after it was reconstituted by financier Kirk Kerkorian . MGM/UA will distribute the film . And it ' s a gamble for MGM ' s production boss , Alan Ladd Jr. , who hit the jackpot with Mr. Lucas and " Star Wars " when Mr. Ladd was at Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp . Mr. Ladd took on " Star Wars " after it had been rejected by two other studios . " I ' d be a fool not to be concerned , " acknowledges Greg Morrison , marketing president for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . But , he says , just wait until " Willow " comes out . " It ' s going to knock the socks off the country and the world . It ' s boffo . " If " Willow " fails , it won ' t be for lack of marketing . MGM/UA ' s media budget for the film exceeds $6 million , and Mr. Lucas ' s company , Lucasfilm Ltd. , says advertising and promotion expenditures will total at least $20 million  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will include TV spots on " The Cosby Show " and " 60 Minutes . " There will also be a " Willow " role-playing game , " Willow " books and " Willow " toys . Can Mr. Lucas work his cosmic magic again ? The question is particularly nerve-racking given that , after two and a half years , " Willow " isn ' t even done yet  --  and screenings are scheduled to begin for theater owners later this month . Still , Director Ron Howard , whose prior credits include " Cocoon " and " Splash , " says : " We ' re actually a little ahead of where we ' re supposed to be . " In fact , Mr. Howard says , things are going so well that the release date was moved up from May 25 , the actual " Star Wars " anniversary , to get more summer playing days and to better compete with the two other potential blockbusters . Filmed in rural England , the Welsh moors , Northern California and in glacial regions of New Zealand , " Willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the story of Willow Ufgood , a member of the Nelwyn dwarf race that lives in fear of the large , warlike Daikinis . Willow becomes guardian to a Daikini baby who is destined to destroy an evil sorceress terrorizing the magic kingdom  --  unless the sorceress can destroy the child first . There ' s some concern that " Willow " will get typecast as a " sword-and-sorcery " picture , the kind that was briefly popular five or six years ago , but never really resulted in a runaway hit . With so much riding on the picture , MGM/UA is playing hardball with theater owners  --  as is Paramount , the Gulf &; Western Inc. unit that is releasing " Crocodile Dundee II , " and the TriStar unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , releasing " Rambo III . " Exhibitors reportedly are being asked to guarantee months-long showings if they want any of the three movies , although some theater owners scoff that such guarantees are unenforceable . Still , there are a number of reasons for exhibitors to want to screen " Willow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His pictures include some of the biggest hits ever . Besides the groundbreaking " Star Wars " trilogy , which reportedly grossed more than $4 billion world-wide from ticket sales and merchandising spinoffs , Mr. Lucas ' s credits include " American Graffiti , " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " and " Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . " In a sense , the 43-year-old Mr. Lucas has more riding on " Willow " than anybody . A lavish spender when it comes to making movies , if " Willow " flops he may find himself embarrassed and marked as box-office poison . Mr. Lucas last was executive producer of " Howard the Duck , " a colossal flop for MCA Inc. that cost more than $35 million to make and grossed about $15 million at the box office . " ' Willow ' has been in my mind for about 15 years , " Mr. Lucas says in a statement . " In order to make fantasy work , you have to create a kind of immaculate reality that exists for the moment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , exhibitors are most enthusiastic about " Crocodile Dundee II " and least sanguine about " Rambo III . " They see " Willow " as a big question mark . " ' Willow ' could be big , with Lucas , " says William Spencer , head film buyer for the 330-screen Tom Moyer Theaters in Portland , Ore . But he adds : " Does the public want to see this film ? Who knows ? " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
