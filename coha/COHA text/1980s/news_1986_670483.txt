The wealth of materials that were exhibited and auctioned this year cover the vast range of styles and categories of works produced on this continent over more than 1 , 000 years . What historians , curators and collectors share in tracking these objects is an intense curiosity about this nation ' s past - as seen in ancient artifacts , folk art fantasies , the furnishings of Victorian mansions , Bakelite radios and pop-up toasters. // The Metropolitan Museum of Art presented some of the oldest and most lavish examples of such works in two dramatically different exhibitions . The boldly graphic pottery crafted between 550 and 1150 in what is now New Mexico was presented in " Mimbres Pottery : Ancient Art of the American Southwest . " These haunting works are among the most expressive of painterly ceramics from the ancient world . The wit , mysticism and sophistication of the pueblo-dwelling people we call Mimbres ( named after a local tree ) was captured by gifted potters in ritual vessels - bowls , platters and jars - works that are among the most important documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great deal more is known about stateside Victorians of a century ago - thanks , in part , to the show " In Pursuit of Beauty : Americans and the Esthetic Movement , " which remains on view through Jan. 11 in the museum ' s American Wing . The elaborate uses of carving , ornament and pattern that reigned in the late 19th century , are presented in what is the most comprehensive exhibition of this work seen in recent years . The simple settings for even the most lavish works among the 200 examples make it possible for the style ' s masterpieces and everything else to be seen and clearly appreciated. // Another radically different face of America was seen in the spare and serenely beautiful tools , furniture , baskets , textiles and graphics that were assembled in " Shaker Design , " an exhibition on view last summer at the Whitney Museum of American Art . The show of 150 objects and photographs was one of the most comprehensive exhibitions of the designs produced by members of this communal sect , and included some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reshaping basic furniture forms to individual needs and in refining the details of everything they produced expressed an energy that represents a major moment in this nation ' s heritage. // After the Shaker show closed at the end of August , there was a month ' s pause before Brooklyn Museum ' s documentation of American industrial ingenuity opened in " The Machine Age in America , 1918-1941 , " an exhibition that remains through Feb. 16 . This is one of the year ' s most memorable shows , and it contains some of the most exciting streamlined examples of the tools and furnishings of everyday life . The optimism and enthusiasm of such industrial designers as Donald Deskey , Walter Dorwin Teague and Norman Bel Geddes remain infectious in the works they conceived between the wars . The gleaming toasters and irons , the temple-like Bakelite radios and bullet-shaped vacuum cleaners are full-blown examples of a utopia envisioned a half century ago by advocates of progress through machines. // Other qualities altogether distinguished the crafting of much of the 18th- and 19th-century trumpet-legged , bonnet-topped and scroll-armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond . The robustly carved chairs , tables , chests and sideboards from most of the major cabinet-making centers are memorable for their bold forms , aristocratic proportions and sheer variety of detailing . Rarely , has there been an exhibition of a single collection of such taste , presented so impressively , as is seen in " American Furniture from the Kaufman Collection , " on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washingtonthrough April 19. // Far less formal attitudes were seen in the portraits , weathervanes , shop signs , quilts , furniture and objects that the Museum of American Folk Art assembled in " Young America : A Folk Art History , " a traveling show that was seen in October in the first stop of its national tour at the IBM Gallery of Science and Art . This show of everyday life in the United States when farmers and country people were the nation ' s majority presents views of America ' s past - and objects that express this history - well worth viewing. // While museums and galleries presented masterpieces in historical contexts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the categories collected in Americana - 18th-  and 19th-century antiques , folk art and 20th-century architectural designs that collectors vie for these days , paying record prices. // The million-dollar level was surpassed twice this year in purchases at auction of American furniture - both times by the same buyer , Eddy G. Nicholson , a New Hampshire industrialist . Mr. Nicholson purchased a Philadelphia Chippendale pie-crust tea table at Christie ' s in January for $1 , 045 , 000 . He eclipsed that record in October when he purchased an 18th-century Philadelphia wing chair , with an impeccable Main Line pedigree , for $1. 1 million in a sale at Sotheby ' s. // Folk art also commanded escalating prices . An 1880 ' s Dapper Danshop figure in a fitted blue jacket , top hat and red and white striped pants , holding a barber pole walking stick in his hand , was sold at Sotheby ' s in October for $258 , 000 . The nattily dressed 77-inch-tall figure had been purchased at Sotheby ' s in 1980 for $53 , 900 . An even higher price for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pintail preening drake , carved about 1915 by A. E. Crowell of East Harwich , Mass. , which was sold at Richard Oliver in Kennebunkport , Me. , in July for $319 , 000 . The price was a record at auction for a decoy and any folk art carving. // Weathervanes too , commanded higher prices this year . The most important example sold was an 18th-century rooster vane , one of the oldest in America . It was sold in July at F. O. Bailey in Portland , Me. , for $121 , 000 , an auction record. //
