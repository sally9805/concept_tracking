But these days the French language is facing difficult times . English is leaving it further and further behind in international scientific and cultural circles , and now the French themselves are debating measures to bring its written form up-to-date and to make it - purists shudder ! - more egalitarian. // Earlier this year , Paris ' s highly regarded Pasteur Institute announced it would replace its principal research publication , Annales , with a new English-language publication complete with an English title. // // The cries of travesty and treason were fierce , but no one could rebut the statistics furnished by the institute ' s director , Maxime Schwartz : Last year , of the 249 manuscripts the institute received , half were from Francophone countries , but only 6 percent were submitted in French . Researchers at Pasteur and other French research centers know from experience , Mr. Schwartz continued , that their work will not receive near the exposure from Annales that it does in English-language publications. // The choice , according to Schwartz , was either to publish in English , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in international scientific studies. // For some of the French , it is quite simply a crisis of stature and of French civilization ' s place in the world . But as Maurice Allais , Nobel Prize winner for economics , explained recently in the Paris daily Le Monde , either French publishers , writers , and researchers take serious steps to publish and be published in English , or not just the French language , but French thought , will disappear from the international scene. // Sensitivities over the Pasteur Institute ' s decision were still sharp when a group of school teachers , linguists , and sociologists proposed a major overhaul of French spelling , to simplify it and make it easier to learn and retain. // Such proposals have come and gone for years , but this time reform proponents have chosen the publication of a new book on the subject to jump-start the debate . Available in bookstores at the end of August - right as hundreds of thousands of students and their teachers were invading them in preparation for the new academic year - the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( ' ' Let Spelling Live ' ' ) , with the authors ' preferred spelling for orthographe making their intentions clear right from the cover. // Opponents of such a reform reject it as insensitive to French historical and linguistic traditions , and unnecessary for all but the laziest or least intelligent . At the French Academy , charged since its creation in the early 18th century with overseeing the French language , academician Jean Dutourd bluntly dismisses any spelling overhaul as benefiting only ' ' the ignorant. ' ' // But proponents say reform is needed not only to bring written French ' ' out of the museum ' ' it has been in for more than a century , but to make language a more egalitarian element in French society. // ' ' Spelling has become a sign of social recognition , ' ' writes Jean-Claude Barbarant , general secretary of France ' s largest schoolteachers ' union , in the book ' s afterword . ' ' Behind the debates surrounding it are conflicts over power to preserve , share , or conquer . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not only in school but in everyday life. ' ' // Reform proponents say that , while spoken French has steadily evolved , the written language , at least since the early 1800s , has not . And they cite the following reasons : With an explosion in publishing in the 19th century , spelling became fixed ; the advent of universal schooling spread one accepted orthography , and higher life expectancies have helped to perpetuate it. // ' ' Other countries , such as Spain and Turkey , China and the Soviet Union , have undertaken modernizations of spelling , ' ' says Jacques Morin , a middle-school teacher and publication director for the national schoolteachers ' union ( SNI ) . ' ' But we still write French as it was written in 1835 , and it ' s becoming more difficult for more people. ' ' // Examples of how French spelling would be simplified include : getting rid of such exceptions as plurals formed by ' ' x ' ' instead of ' ' s ' ' ( bijoux , cailloux , choux ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile ) ; dropping such anomalies as the ' ' s ' ' in temps , or coordinating a noun ' s written form with its gender ( trophee would become trophe , vertu would become vertue ) . // Mr. Morin believes it is ridiculous to equate a reform of French spelling with disregard for French civilization ' s classical roots , as some opponents have charged . ' ' Take the word rythme , ' ' says Morin , which he and the other reformers would spell ritme . ' ' The ' y ' ( literally ' Greek i ' in French ) has nothing to do with the Greeks , but was given to us by copyists during the Middle Ages , who thought it was pretty . Italians write ritmo , ' ' he adds , ' ' does that make them less Latin than the French ? ' ' // As for the charge that such a reform simply accommodates society ' s lowest achievers , Morin tells the story of a university student who came to him , distressed because he couldn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' After two years of working on his spelling , he was able to pass . He is now the chief administrator at a Paris-region hospital , ' ' says Morin , ' ' but out of curiosity I recently gave him a spelling test , and he was back to making the same mistakes he did years ago. ' ' // While they point up the degree of concern over the state of the French language , the calls for orthographic reforms are not expected by many French to go much further. // Although it traditionally remains the French Academy ' s ' ' privilege ' ' to determine spelling , the government can also take steps toward reform if it chooses. // Prime Minister Michel Rocard named a group to study the state of the French language earlier this year , and Education Minister Lionel Jospin addressed the issue of spelling reform in his address marking the new school year this fall. // Mr. Jospin said he is ready ' ' to battle against the absurd and that which is not justified , but for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French language . ' ' He would allow specialists to work in this ' ' sensitive domain ' ' and obsverved that any spelling reform would require great sensitivity ' ' because our language expresses our literature and our culture.
