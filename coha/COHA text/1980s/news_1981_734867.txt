Ezekiel is one of eight Old Testament figures who appear in triangular motifs over the arched windows of the chapel . close , new look at elDichelangelo 's brilliance The master 's Vatican frescoes are revealed as never before in a book that is a photographic tour de force . By Michael Coakley , tmt o gaze upward at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is a singular experience that can cause the knees of any true art lover to buckle . The magnificence of Michelangelo 's frescoes , the awesome scale and power of the work , is readily apparent to every one of the hundreds of thousands of tourists who file through this Vatican sanctuary each year . ON THE COVER : A detail from one of the naked youths in the pair above the Cumaean Sibyl in the Sistine Chapel ceiling .

Numerous art books have depicted the major and most famous scenes from each of these four , such as the " Creation of Adam " on the Sistine ceiling . What makes the new book so different and so valuable to art students is that it focuses also on the minor scenes , like the naked youths ( the subject of the Magazine cover is one example ) whose bodies act as a border for the portraitsof the prophets , and the until ( angels ) on the left of the Persian Sibyl . These figures , usually less vivid in color and overshadowed by nearby important scenes , have been largely ignored through the centuries , having been considered to be simply decoration . Yet Okamura 's photographs , taken on film as large as 8 by 10 inches , reveal many of these supposed ornaments to be treasures in themselves . The paintings of the naked youths , for instance , display a range of human emotions that , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the principal characters . Two asides here on the matter of // Photographer Okamura spent six months on high scaffolding . // That neglect ? if such a word can possibly be used in reference to one of history 's immortals ? may end now with the publication of a remarkable new book , " The Vatican Frescoes of Michelangelo . " The book , actually a two-volume set , is remarkable in several aspects , not the least of which is its price . At $6,000 ( it was $4,500 before Jan. 1 ) , this is among the most expensive books ever produced . Its pages measure 17 by 202 inches , and one foldout is more than four feet wide . Whether any book , even this spectacular limited edition , is worth so much money has generated a lively debate within , the publishing industry . But the quality of the product in this case seems beyond dispute . Sir Kenneth Clark , the noted British art historian , described the book 's 352 color photographs this way : " They are superb . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revelation . I am sure that people who have hitherto given no more than a conventional lip service to Michelangelo will be bowled over by his colossal brilliance , power , and delicacy . " The book was published by Abbeville Press , a small New York firm founded by the late Harry N. Abrams , a pioneer in the field of art book publishing . In addition , there are two copublishers , Kodansha , Ltd. of Tokyo and Times Books of London . To a great extent , however , the book is a tribute to one man , the Japanese art photographer Takashi Okamura , who spent six months perched precariously on a pipe scaffolding to record the frescoed figures that loomed only a few feet above his head . ( Michelangelo crouched in similar positions in the identical spots while painting the ceiling . ) Actually , the two volumes feature four Michelangelo masterpieces : the Sistine Chapel ceiling itself ; " The Last Judgment " painted on the adjacent altar wall ; and two frescoes in the nearby Pauline Chapel , " The Conversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Together , the four works represent the artist 's most ambitious undertaking in painting . They also represent a time The range and foresight of this artist are plainly incredible . // Michelangelo and nudity : The artist employed only males as models . When it became necessary to paint a nude female figure , he simply attached a woman 's breasts to what is clearly a man 's body , making for some very strange-looking females , an anomaly that is painfully obvious in Okamura 's photographs . Also , upon completion of the ceiling , Michelangelo found himself embroiled in a raging controversy over the extensive nudity displayed in the frescoes . The reigning pontiff , Julius II , did not object . His successor did . A second artist was subsequently called in to cover up some of the offending flesh , most often taking the easy way out by slapping on a crudely painted dark-colored drape or the medieval version of a jockstrap , another little problem that does not escape this book 's close-up gaze . Along with featuring the overlooked portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small aspect of each of the major scenes . There is one shot simply of a vase . But it is far more than a picture of a vase . It is a revelation of Michelangelo as a superb still-life painter , a fact that even experts heretofore would have had a hard time accepting . " The Last Judgment " is a mural remarkably different in style from the ceiling frescoes . The detailed photographs of this frightening work , with its horrible faces of the damned , the sunken countenances of those rising from the dead , suggest the despair of a Picasso nearly 400 years later . Close-ups of " The Conversion of St. Paul " by contrast recall the shimmering sunshine of the French impressionists . The range and foresight of this artist , operating in the supposedly confining milieu of the 16th Century , are plainly incredible . Ninety-nine of the photographs depict Michelangelo 's work actual size . This allows one to better appreciate not only the awesome scope of the giant murals but also the great difficulty in executing such a work . Okamura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs ( page 17 ) , talked with some authority on what problems the master must have encountered . " Lying as close as 50 cm. to the ceiling , one can no longer encompass an entire scene within one 's eyespan . Less than a square meter of mural , which I am photographing , exists over my head , " wrote Okamura after his first day atop the scaffolding . To Michelangelo , almost the same perimeters may have applied . I imagine there was a preliminary sketch for the painting , but I could hardly imagihe , now standing in the same place , how Michelangelo could grasp and depict in their entirety the features and figures he drew . " In order to properly photograph the // Reproduced with permission of the Most libraries are unable to afford the book 's staggering price . // frescoes , Okamura climbed the high pipe framework for the ceiling exposures , arranged his powerful flood-lamps , focused and composed his subject in the camera 's ground glass , and then ( except when using strobe lights ) clambered back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially designed 65-foot-long magnetic release ? to prevent even the slightest vibration during exposure time . All the shooting in the Sistine Chapel was done in the evening , with the scat-I. - folding dismantled by technicians at the conclusion of each session to make way for the perennial line of tourists and pilgrims the following morning . The Vatican cooperated with this ambitious endeavor so that there would be a permanent record of the masterpieces . In the case of the ceiling frescoes , already in considerable disrepair , there is a real fear that they may not survive many more decades . The book has fulfilled the hope of the Vatican in the narrow sense . There is now a brilliant photographic portfolio of the frescoes . The first copy of " The Vatican Frescoes of Michelangelo " was presented to Pope John Paul II by the publishers . The delighted pontiff , in return , bestowed a medal on photographer Okamura . Unfortunately , however , the outrageously high price and the manner in which the book is being distributed raise the prospect that the Vatican 's purpose may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only 600 copies of the volumes have been printed , with no hope of a duplicate second edition because the original color plates are being destroyed . Of the 600 , 300 are being distributed in the United States , 200 in Japan , and 100 throughout the rest of the world . According to a spokesman for Ab- beville Press , about half of the American copies have been snapped up by private collectors and speculators . ( Those in the latter category may or may not be art lovers ; what they surely love is money , and the book is no doubt a good investment because of the limited number of copies printed and the wide notice it has already attracted . ) Abbeville insists that the bulk of the other half of the U. S. copies will find their way to institutions and art libraries , but they will provide few specifics on just which libraries . In a number of cases , private individuals are buying copies and promising to turn them over to a favored library sometime in the near future when the book will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger tax reduction . This is obviously a poor way , not to mention a very slow way , to get such an important book into the libraries . But for even some of the biggest university libraries , there is no other way . Their budgets do not allow for such a large expenditure on one book , no matter how worthwhile , a point that even Abbeville concedes . And the vast majority of all libraries are out of luck no matter how generous their patrons . There just are n't anywhere near enough of the books to go around . Robert Abrams is president of Abbeville Press . He is the son of Harry Abrams , and he is a man clearly troubled by the suggestion that what he has produced , while perhaps a masterpiece in its own right , represents a kind of elitism that is dangerous to both art and publishing , two inherently public media that require dissemination in order to survive . Interviewed in his handsome Park Avenue office , where a Norman Rockwell drawing of his widely re // spected father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by the limited access to the book , especially when that limitation prevents those who would appreciate it most ? serious students of art ? from seeing it . " Believe me , we had no intention of making it difficult for anyone to use it . " he said . " But I felt a strong obligation to make sure that this project was going to be done right , that it be not just another book on Michelangelo . And in order to do it right , it was necessary tospend a great deal of money : ' Abrams will say only that production . costs amounted to " several hundred thousand dollars . " To ensure that his firm did not lose money on the project , he explained , it was necessary to charge such an extremely high price and make the edition so limited . In its press release announcing publication of the book , Abbeville stated : " The publishers guarantee that the plates will be destroyed and that the photographs never will be reprinted in this format , size , or degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement . " This thinly disguised come-on to speculators also leaves Abbeville an out , one which Abrams sounds as if he may employ . While the plates may be gone , the color transparencies remain . The photographs could be reproduced again in a different format , perhaps as a portfolio . " That 's an issue we can deal with in a few years , " said Abrams , when asked if something such as this would be possible . " I 've tried to think of a way , " he added . " 1 hope that I can . " He surely ought to try . It seems unlikely that the Vatican , without whose full cooperation the book could never have been produced , would want this definitive record of its treasure limited to a handful of gilded coffee tables . The fact that the photographs have been such a success , that they would be of such great value to students and historians of art , makes their wider distribution all the more imperative . ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
