Hinckley and Chapman have their days in court <P> The whole world analyzed their perverted reach for infamy , which was precisely their point . As their lives were searched out in the glare of hideous celebrity , they became a matched pair , similar in age , appearance and murderous intent . Last week , almost in tandem , they had their days in court . In Washington , John Warnock Hinckley Jr. , 26 , pleaded not guilty to the attempted assassination of President Reagan . His lawyers were granted 30 days to plan a defense . In New York , Mark David Chapman , 26 , pleaded guilty and was given 20 years to life for the murder of John Lennon . <P> Hinckley , the solitary third child of an oil-rich Colorado family , had spent the past few years idling through the Sunbelt , collecting guns , living on junk food , watching television . He became obsessed with Actress Jodie Foster , who starred in Taxi Driver , a movie about a loner who tries to shoot a presidential candidate . Hinckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time from Washington : " I will admit to you that the reason I 'm going ahead with this attempt now is because I just can not wait any longer to impress you . " Then he took a .22-cal. revolver and wounded Reagan , Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy , Washington Policeman Thomas Delahanty and Press Secretary James Brady , who two weeks ago underwent a fourth major operation . <P> Since April , Hinckley has been given psychiatric examinations by the defense , the court and the prosecution . The Government , according to a lawyer familiar with the case , decided he was competent to stand trial and was probably sane when he shot Reagan . Hinckley and his lawyers now have 30 days to decide whether to plead not guilty by reason of insanity or to change his plea to guilty . He faces five terms of life imprisonment . <P> Chapman , the son of an Atlanta bank-loan collector , liked working with children , played in a high school band and idolized Lennon . He left his job as a Honolulu security guard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . After getting Lennon 's autograph , he killed his hero with four hollow .38-cal. bullets . He was arrested moments later , carrying a copy of J.D. Salinger 's The Catcher in the Rye . <P> In June , Chapman , a born-again Christian , told the court that God had told him to plead guilty , and so he did , against the advice of his lawyers . At his sentencing last week , he announced a vow of silence and offered , as " my final spoken words , " a passage from The Catcher in the Rye : " I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all . Thousands of little kids , and nobody 's around-nobody big , I mean-except me . And , I 'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff . What I have to do , I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff . . . I 'd just be the catcher in the rye and all . " Judge Dennis Edwards Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crime was " carefully planned and executed . " The judge did , however , recommend psychiatric treatment during his incarceration.
