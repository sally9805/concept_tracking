Despite its foregone conclusion , the convention was a sizzler of a show <P> As Walter Mondale prepared to end his long march to the presidential nomination at last week 's Democratic Convention , he and his staff left no detail , large or small , to chance . Yet no planner can manufacture drama and passion , and the Democrats ' four-day spectacular in San Francisco surprised everybody with its abundance of both . From New York Governor Mario Cuomo 's poignant evocation of the party 's melting-pot past to Jesse Jackson 's sweaty , moving , 51-minute tour de force to Geraldine Ferraro 's winning performance in her unaccustomed role as history maker , the Democrats put on a sizzler of a show . And to end it , even Fritz Mondale , with his vision of opening doors to the future , gave what may have been the best speech of his life , one that he had honed through no fewer than 15 drafts . <P> Yet Mondale very nearly scuttled all his meticulous plans with an uncharacteristically impulsive act on the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman Charles Manatt . Presidential nominees usually replace their party chairmen with their own people , but they generally wait until after the convention has ended . Even so , the firing of Manatt would probably not have caused much of a national stir had it not been for Mondale 's choice of Bert Lance , President Carter 's scandal-tainted Budget Director , to replace him . Whether they liked Manatt or not , and many did not , scores of delegates rushed to his defense . Willie Brown Jr. , California 's Democratic assembly speaker , sarcastically professed to see a plus for Mondale in the debacle . " He will now be perceived as a miracle worker , " cracked Brown . " He made Chuck Manatt into a sympathetic figure . " <P> Mondale , who felt indebted to Lance for helping him win crucial primaries in Alabama and Georgia last March 13 , evidently hoped to ram through the appointment while the convention was celebrating Ferraro 's nomination as Vice President . But a series of news leaks , riled the delegates before they arrived in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were fighting mad , even though the Mondale camp had wisely decided to back off , at least halfway . <P> Manatt was kept on , but with a watchful Mondale loyalist , Michael Berman , installed as director-and de facto ruler-of the D.N.C. , and Lance was given overall charge of the Mondale campaign . It had been a damaging blunder : not only had Mondale saddled himself with an unseemly link to the Carter Administration ; he had seemed weak and vacillating in handling the uproar . Said Campaign Chairman James Johnson : " We did it in a clumsy way , and we wish we had n't . " <P> Mondale 's two opponents , Jackson and Gary Hart , saw the dissension over Lance as a last chance to pry away Mondale delegates and block a first-ballot victory . Hart 's aides happily spread the word that some 50 delegates who had been unpledged or in Mondale 's camp had expressed interest in voting for Hart out of disgust over the Lance affair . Mondale 's retreat , however , took much of the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
