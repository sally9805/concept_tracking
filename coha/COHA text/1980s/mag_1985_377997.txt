The good news : it is important for the young to stay lean , but a little heft helps people live longer , according to a federal researcher at the Gerontology Research Center in Baltimore . The bad news : many obesity and cardiovascular specialists say that lifelong leanness is still the desirable goal . <P> Guidelines on girth have been the subject of a growing dispute since 1983 , when the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. updated its charts on desirable weight . The poundage associated with the lowest death rates , the insurance firm found , had risen by as much as 14 Ibs. over such weights in its 1959 tables . Now Dr. Reubin Andres , clinical director of the Gerontology Research Center of the National Institute on Aging , has added more fat to the fire . Using the same data ( from 4.2 million people charted by 25 insurance companies over two decades ) , Andres has concluded that people in their 20s should weigh less than Metropolitan Life indicates , 40-year-olds should weigh about the same , but people in their 50s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibs. heavier . Andres , a gerontologist who has been studying the effect of weight gain on aging for more than five years , feels that after the age of 20 , almost any normally lean person can put on about a pound a year . <P> The Andres study not only challenges the conventional wisdom , it says that men and women of the same height should weigh roughly the same . This relaxed attitude toward weight gain does not find favor with the medical establishment . The American Heart Association has stated that it finds even the 1983 Metropolitan Life table too lenient . Obesity researchers at the National Institutes of Health say that weights 20% higher than the Metropolitan midpoints are hazardous . Says Dr. Robert F. Kushner , assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago : " We do n't have anything to gain health-wise by allowing elderly patients to put on another 20 to 30 Ibs. , because it 's likely it will be fat tissue . " <P> Dr. William Castelli , director of the 36-year Framingham Heart Study on longevity , declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gain over the 1959 Metropolitan Life tables , your death rate increases 2% over the next 26 years . " Until the doctors can resolve their conflicting interpretations , many Americans will find it prudent to hold back on that second helping of pasta .  --  By Ellie McGrath .
