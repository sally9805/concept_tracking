Suzanne Farrell is a lucky dancer . She is 39 now , and still the most exciting ballerina in the world . Purists may fret over whether her lower back is as springy as ever , but the years have if anything enhanced her artistry  --  the daring and the inspired eccentricity with which she can ignite a dull ballet and redefine a great role . Farrell created her own biggest stroke of fortune simply by inspiring George Balanchine over nearly two decades to create a necklace of marvelous parts for her ; it is surely the richest repertory of any dancer within memory . <P> After Mr. B. died in 1983 , one might have expected Farrell to round out her career performing this legacy , but fresh material keeps coming . Two years ago , Peter Martins drew on her restraint and musicianship in a delicate work , Rossini Quartets . Last week at the New York City Ballet , Jerome Robbins weighed in with a really fat part . In Memory of . . . , set to Alban Berg 's elegiac Violin Concerto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbins usually allows himself to be . In the role of a dying girl , Farrell adds another heroine to her gallery of lost ladies . <P> Berg wrote his concerto in 1935 after the death of Manon Gropius , the beloved daughter of his friend Alma Mahler and the architect Walter Gropius . The girl died at 19 of polio and the composer dedicated the work " to the memory of an angel . " Robbins ' scenario begins quietly and a bit flatly as Farrell moves with increasing stiffness and bafflement between her lover ( tenderly danced by Joseph Duell ) and friends . Suddenly they move off and she is left with a gauntly beautiful angel of death ( Adam Luders ) . Their pas de deux is the heart of the ballet . The moves are often slow and arduous , but the great tension and energy between the dancers make the struggle heartbreaking . Robbins goes boldly to Farrell 's melodramatic strain , and she responds by portraying the horror of death without any romantic gloss . He exploits her ability to defy equilibrium in shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drama . <P> Robbins ' more familiar virtues are evident too , particularly his inspired casting . In selecting Luders  --  a fine partner but a phlegmatic performer often taken for granted by the audience and even by himself  --  the choreographer rinses away years of familiarity to present a dancer of mesmerizing ardor . Luders reveals a plangency and aplomb that match Farrell 's stroke for stroke . <P> Did the music remind Robbins of the past ? In the theme of death and transfiguration there are resonances of the mourning and then renewal that the company has had to endure since Balanchine 's death . The ballet ends with a vision of heaven , indicated in the score by a beautiful chorale . As always , Robbins skillfully uses some company youngsters : Peter Boal , looking like an archangel , Damian Woetzel , a particularly blithe spirit who joined the troupe last month , and Teresa Reyes , a recent incarnation of Balanchine 's leggy ideal . In Memory of . . . ends with a homage to him . Farrell is carried offstage by Duell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chaconne  --  also set in Elysian fields .
