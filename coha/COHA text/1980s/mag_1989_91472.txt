I thought I had the answer . I was down in my basement , running like the wind on my brand-new treadmill , watching the snappy LED readout tell me my speed , my distance , how well my heart was performing and even how many calories I had burned . // Several things had led me to subterranean jogging . First , I live in a city , and my Joe Namath knees ca n't take the pavement anymore . But more important , the city in which I live , which happens to be the nation 's capital , has become a free-fire zone of late , a sort of open season on bystanders . Just plain folks have stopped bullets while eating lunch , walking to school or even washing dishes . When a woman was kidnapped at knife point right near my home , I hung up my racing Reeboks. // Then about two pounds of cellulite later , as I wandered through a shopping mall , the answer appeared . In one of those high-tech stores that make you think everybody has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It cost a great deal of money  --  more than my first car . But this machine not only went round and round and told you how much you were accomplishing , it also had a built-in photo-optic cell that could watch your feet . Somehow it adjusted itself as you padded along , thereby avoiding , the literature said , " eventual ankle and knee problems . " The next thing I knew , a salesman was there and my mall-walking Reeboks had thumped along a mile without even leaving the store . I was hooked . Yet I reasoned that since my feet had gone hundreds of miles without a photo-optic cell looking after them , I might elsewhere find a less sophisticated , less expensive home running machine . // I did just that at a large department store where America and Cheryl Tiegs shop . The machine came home that day . It was perfection . // I would crank up the motor , hop on and select my pace by turning a dial toward either a turtle or a rabbit . I could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounce along to Sherry and pretend it was 1962 . I could jog through the sound track of Flash-dance or Footloose . Then one day , right when I was feeling glad that this machine , Bruce Springsteen and I were all born in the USA , it happened . // What sounded like a gunshot came from the wall , and the belt stopped dead . My God , they got me in my basement ! I thought . I had mixed feelings when I saw that the noise had only been the sound of the electrical socket blowing out of the wall . I tried another plug . Slowly but surely , as Bruce lamented being laid off at the lumberyard , the basement began filling with smoke . I called the service center . Two men came out , squatted down and watched in amazement as a bolt of lightning shot out of the treadmill 's motor . // In the meantime , I took to jogging on a path that encircles the home run boundaries of a local urban ball field . But the boys of summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . If , for instance , the leftfielder fails to put his beer down in time to catch a high fly , the jogger  --  200 feet away at the time  --  will receive dark glares that say , You broke my concentration ! // When the new motor arrived I was assured it was similar to the old one . It was . It too filled the basement with smoke . The third serviceman determined that the machine had the wrong circuit panel . He ordered a new one . I felt sad that my new friend the jogging machine sat there disemboweled. // Finally , when the machine had had every conceivable organ transplant , the repairman turned it on . Turtle to rabbit to turtle , it hummed nicely . He smiled . I doubt he had made it to the 7-Eleven before I was opening windows in the basement to let the smoke out . My machine had died on full rabbit . I exchanged the machine for a different model . I was happy at last , albeit briefly . // I now run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus fumes . Last week we had our 360th homicide of the year . But the time will come again when the machine , Bruce Springsteen and I will all be glad we were born in the USA . In the meantime , we 're awaiting new repair parts being sent from Utah .
