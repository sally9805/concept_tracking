One of Israel 's greatest assets has traditionally been its image as a beleaguered nation in a sea of hostile enemies and its corresponding claim to moral superiority . But as their forces closed in relentlessly on the P.L.O . in West Beirut , and television screens around the world showed numbing images of death and destruction , the Israeli government and people feared that the international view of their country was swiftly changing . Israel was rightly concerned that having won the battle in Lebanon , it might still lose the political war in the living rooms of Europe and the U.S. <P> Last week a poll conducted by the Associated Press and NBC News in the U.S. confirmed Israel 's fears , revealing that 51% of those surveyed disapproved of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , compared with 25% who supported the move . More to the point , 59% felt that Israel had gone too far in its attacks on Beirut , while only 7% said the level of force was appropriate . <P> In the European press , the image of Israel as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggernaut . Newspapers in Paris have termed Begin a " fascist " warmonger . The West German press , which has traditionally gone out of its way to avoid criticism of Israel , has begun to criticize Begin 's belligerency . Die Zeit has decried the Israeli " bloodbath " as going beyond what could be justified as the " eye for an eye " justice of the Old Testament . <P> Faced with this kind of comment , Prime Minister Begin argued that his country 's aggressive attacks were necessary to reduce casualties among Israelis , Said Begin : " Given a choice between dead Jews and a good press , and living Jews and a bad press , I would prefer the latter . " But worried Israeli politicians held investigations into charges that government spokesmen were responsible for the unfavorable coverage because of their mishandling of the press . The investigations were inconclusive , but the Foreign Ministry believes that the army 's heavyhanded treatment of reporters in the first week of the war tended to make them more sympathetic to the P.L.O . viewpoint . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it too readily accepted claims of civilian deaths reported by the P.L.O . and mistakenly , if not maliciously , charged the Israelis with committing acts of cruelty . A prime case in point was the photograph of a badly burned baby who United Press International said had been the victim of an accidental Israeli bomb drop in East Beirut . President Reagan cited the picture in his talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir as an example of why Jerusalem had to stop the bombing of the city . In their defense the Israelis claim that no bomb had fallen in East Beirut and that the child , in truth , had been hit by a P.L.O . shell . Although the U.P.I , stood by the accuracy of its caption , the news agency was looking further into the matter .
