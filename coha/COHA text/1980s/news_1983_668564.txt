What concerned the winningest teams in the National and American Leagues yesterday - on the eve of their first meeting - was what wasn ' t here . What wasn ' t at the rain-shortened Phillies workout at Memorial Stadium was Steve Carlton , who was back in Philadelphia seeing a chiropractor for the back injury that flared up and forced him out of Saturday night ' s clincher after six innings . While manager Paul ( The Pope ) Owens said that " the spasms were broken " an hour after the game and that " he ' s fine , " he also admitted that Carlton " needs the rest " and will wait until the third game to start . However , other Phillies officials privately admitted some concern , although they added that he had gone to this same chiropractor before he won his 300th game and proceeded to have three brilliant starts in a row . In other words , they don ' t know what to expect from this vital future Hall of Famer . Carlton , however , will be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitter will not be , however , and as the years roll awayfrom the days when pitchers last hit in the minor and major leagues , it has become a major factor . A factor that has the Orioles concerned . Orioles manager Joe Altobelli has to remove from the lineup Ken Singleton , who hasn ' t played in the outfield since Sept. 28 , 1982 , and has played only three games there since 1981 . That leaves Altobelli with a staff of nine pitchers , one of whom has batted in a regular-season major league game . That is Jim Palmer , and next to Dennis Martinez , he might be the last man on the staff . To replace Singleton , who knocked in 85 runs this year and batted .364 in the playoffs and Series in 1979 , Altobelli has to use pitchers . And other than Palmer , only two of them - opener starter Scott McGregor and reliever Tippy Martinez - ever batted in the minors ; each signed with the Yankees in June 1973 , and had a combined total of fewer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They kidded about it as they took batting practice for what Mike Flanagan says was the third time all season . Tippy took his swings and stepped out of the cage . " Run to first , " yelled coach Cal Ripken . " You forgot to hand out the maps , " Flanagan yelled back . While batting coach Ralph Rowe pointed out that McGregor outhit George Brett in 1972 when they were teammates at El Segundo ( Cal . ) High School and that second-game starter Mike Boddicker was all-Big Ten as a third baseman ( and even forgot to mention that Flanagan once hit three home runs in a game for UMass at Orono , Maine ) , even Rowe had to describe most of the swings as " terrible . " Storm Davis said he ' d had two spring-training at-bats since high school . " There ' s no question that it ' s a big disadvantage to them , " says Owens . " Our pitchers have hit , theirs haven ' t . That goes for bunting , too . That can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People don ' t realize how big a factor Singleton is in our lineup , " saysMcGregor . " He gets so many big clutch hits , and he also keeps a lot of rallies going because he gets so many ( 99 ) walks . " The first few times the AL teams played with the DH during the season but couldn ' t use it in the Series , things didn ' t go badly . " Yeah , " said Earl Weaver , " but then you had a generation of pitchers who grew up with hitting . By the time we got in there in ' 79 , it was completely different . I know we were hurt by it . Eddie Murray stopped hitting , and we ' d try to juggle hitters . And when it counted they had us all righthanded and set up for Kent Tekulve . " The disadvantages come in three ways : 1 . The Orioles lineup , which was so strong during the season , is completely different now . Without Singleton , the bottom four spots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd Cruz and McGregor . Four spots in the order that averaged 26 RBIs apiece . 2 . It affects the bullpen . The Phillies , with Al Holland , Ron Reed and Willie Hernandez , are set for two pinch hitters and lineup switches . The Orioles are afraid to use Tim Stoddard , so they basically only have Tippy and Sammy Stewart for three- , four- and five-inning stints. 3 . It affects their platooning . Can they continue to plug in John Lowenstein for Gary Roenicke every time they switch pitchers ? " I don ' t know yet , " said Altobelli . " I managed in the National League for a couple of years , so maybe that will help . Actually , what would really help is a few three-run homers and some good pitching . " As McGregor and Denny - who was 3-1 against Baltimore as a Cleveland Indian - prepared for tonight ' s opener , people scrambled to find edges : - National Leaguers feel that the Phillies are vulnerable to breaking-ballstaffs , which the Orioles definitely are ; many can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against McGregor , who Perez murdered when he was with the Red Sox . - Some feel the Orioles will have trouble with the turf , but they were 16-8 on it during the season , and Cruz , who has the best arm of any AL infielder with the possible exception of Joaquin Gutierrez , is a fine turf infielder. - Some pointed to the Phillies ' 40-41 road record , but most of that was early in the season . " We were a totally different team the last month , " said Joe Lefebvre , and , after all , they won the dogfight NL East by taking two out of three in Pittsburgh , sweeping the Cardinals in St. Louis and sweeping Les Expos in Montreal , just as Baltimore demolished Toronto , Detroit and Milwaukee when it counted . - The Phillies were 18-19 against lefties , and they ' ll get McGregor and Flanagan twice apiece . Baltimore hits righties much better and will get a minimum of five righthanders if the Series goes seven . Tomorrow night ' s matchup will be rookies Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Righetti-Fernando Valenzuela in ' 81 . Before that , Dick Hughes vs . Gary Waslewski in ' 67 . Altobelli says he will use Flanagan Friday in Philly but that he is undecided about whether to come back with McGregor on three days rest , as he prefers , for Game 4 or use Davis . While Denny was 6- 0 on three days rest , Owens is talking about using Marty Bystrom in the fourth game . " All the statistics and conjecture mean very little , " said McGregor . " It ' s great afterward to rationalize what happens . Right now , I ' m thinking about pitching , not worrying about hitting or the DH . If we lose , maybe we can blame the DH then , but for now , I ' d prefer to pitch , not talk .
