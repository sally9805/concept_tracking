In California , the rich vineyards grow and glow <P> In a 19th century American engraving entitled The Old Wine God and the New , a graybeard Bacchus passes a vine-wreathed staff to a wide-eyed Western stripling . The artist 's message : the age-old mysteries and delectations of the grape are flourishing in California soil . It must have evoked a guffaw or two from Victorian clubmen with noses deep in the real stuff from the Mdoc or the Cte d'Or . <P> It has taken more than a century for Bacchus Jr . to assemble his credentials : today they are a cause for hallelujahs , not harrumphs . In wine tastings from Perth to Paris , the bottles from California have been winning golds , silvers and bronzes in informal vinous Olympics against the products of some of the world 's most astute and experienced winemakers . This is not to suggest , as some Californiaphiles would have it , that the Old Wine God is about to be toppled by the New . It does confirm that California 's best wines are now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> That is quite an achievement , considering the troubles that the immigrant Vitis vinifera* has had surviving in North America . The European vine did not fare well in chilly Northeastern climes . In fact , making a potable domestic wine was quite possibly the only undertaking in which Thomas Jefferson ever admitted defeat . The most grievous blow of all was the Prohibition era , in which the wine industry died on the vine . It has not been helped since by many Americans ' two-fisted addiction to beer and hard liquor or aversion to alcohol in any form ( dry and blue laws ) . Yet the past decade has seen the completion of a delicious circle : the American discovery of wine , on a large scale , as a part of the civilized life , and the maturing of an industry capable of satisfying sophisticated palates . <P> Wine consumption in the U.S. is still only a spit in the barrel by European standards : two gallons annually per capita ( vs. 27 in Italy ) , ranging from less than three quarts per adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , the amount of wine drunk in the U.S. has doubled in ten years and is increasing at the rate of 5% yearly . That adds up to a huge present and future market for table wines-particularly for the California vintners , who supply 70% of all the wine consumed in this country . <P> Indeed , Americans ' new love affair with the grape may be one of the few recorded instances of the consumer leading the industry . More than a million Americans are enrolled in wine appreciation courses ; some 160,000 students at 620 college campuses are taking classes in oenology . The meticulous annual " barrel " tasting of new California vintages held by Manhattan 's splendid Four Seasons restaurant has become a spectacular . Last winter 's event drew requests from more than 2,000 would-be sippers for the 200 available tickets-at $75 each . Some 50,000 oenophiles have taken part in a procession of blind tastings of California and European wines held in 31 states by the California Wine Institute ; the unmarked California bottles have won overwhelmingly . And so it goes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I ca n't think of another product in America that is so exhaustively written about , talked about and analyzed. "
