This is not a position I ever imagined occupying . In 1964 I was , I think , the first student in the annals of sophomore history honors to get a C in that course . In that same year , though , an event took place here that I want to talk about today . That was the Free Speech Movement : a few students , then several thousand students , insisting that the limits the university administration had placed on their advocacy of social change were wrong . This event had far-reaching consequences , though not even the most farseeing of those who were part of the event could have imagined the most concrete , perhaps the most important . Today , thanks to the commercial hook of media anniversaries , there are plenty of books in the stores highlighting the Free Speech Movement as the spark for the decade of protest called " The Sixties " ? but this may just be gush . More vitally , the Free Speech Movement was very likely the crucial factor in Ronald Reagan 's election as governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , his election as President of the United States fourteen yearslater . In 1980 , Ronald Reagan , calling for " National Renewal " and setting himself against the chaos of the previous two decades as the embodiment of traditional values , was still running against the Free Speech Movement . Edwin Meese , who as an assistant district attorney of Alameda County led the prosecution of Free Speech Movement demonstrators , became Attorney General of the United States ; it was that prosecution that brought him to the attention of Ronald Reagan . It was often said , in 1964 , that those who took part in a revolt against their own institutions would someday be running them , It has n't worked out that way . It 's a commonplace that history is written by the powerful ; it 's more to the point to say that power writes history . Events that do not change into power or that take place outside of the normal circuits in which power is exchanged , outside of the institutional distribution and control of social goods ? such events , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are resistant to history , because history does not know how to account for them ; and history resists them , because it can get away with it . Such events are precisely what Walter Benjamin was talking about when he spoke of the articulation of real history as the attempt to " seize hold of a memory as it flashes up in a moment of danger . " But because such moments do not turn into history , they lose their shape , and turn into stupid self-parodies , Legends , nonsense ? old stories , told by cranks . I 'm talking about words on a page ? the words some of you will be putting on pages . No decent historian would think of quoting one of Ronald Reagan 's inaugural addresses merely by referring to a newspaper account , an oral anecREADINGS 21 dote , a vague memory . Any decent historian would go to the archives , get the documents , copy them out , get it right . During the Free Speech Movement , though , a speech was given that became famous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the speech Mario Savio gave on the steps of Sproul Hall on December 2 , 1964 , just before the occupation that led to the finale of the drama . In the years that followed , down to this day , this speech has been quoted again and again ? and , in my reading , through scores of books and articles , with one exception , never accurately . The words Mario Savio spoke were not , as a theory of social change , brilliant . They were full of contradictions . They do not stand up under analysis , which in any case they have never received . But his words were poetic , part of a particular moment of danger ? they helped define that moment , even partly created it . The speaker 's cadence was part of whatever meaning his words had ; the rhythm was part of the meaning . So was the strain , the catch , almost the whine , in Savio 's voice ? something his words , presented accurately on a page , can contain . This is what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine becomes so odious , makes you so sick at heart , that you ca n't take part ; you ca n't even tacitly take part , and you 've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels , upon the levers , upon all the apparatus and you 've got to make it stop . And you 've got to indicate to the people who run it , to the people who own it , that unless you 're free , the machine will he prevented from working at all . Well , we could pause and think about those words ? about their odd politeness , about Savio 's use of the word " indicate , " about his fundamental acceptance of things-as-they-are ; there is no suggestion of destroying the machine . The cadence of the lines could , perhaps , tell us something about that time and place . But what interests me today is both the poetry of the words and the transformation of that poetry into a certain historical fact : that is , once past the year 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times they have been quoted , printed , published , have almost never appeared as they were spoken . Almost no one has gotten them right . Almost no one has bothered to get them right . No one had to . Over the years , following these words through the essays and hooks in which they appeared , I played a sort of game . carefully chosen at all , but simply seized out of the moment , generated by the moment ? would take place ? Here 's a quote : " There comes a time when you 've got to bend , fold , spindle and mutilate ? AND SHUT THE MOTHERFUCKER DOWN ! " Unquote . That is a published version of Mario Savio 's speech ; trees died that it might be published . Why did this violence to history occur ? There was no shortage of documents : Savio 's speech was recorded , and even issued on a phonograph record . The correct words , with all of their rhythm intact , appeared in the basic anthology on the Free Speech Move-ment ;  - -  .1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quoted accurately because they were not part of the circuit of significance . Not in 1964 , and not today . Nor is anything else about the sort of moment they spoke for . Those words did not change into power , and so they did not make history . The sort of history they spoke for is the history told by cranks . As a pop music critic , I 've had fun diving into the role of the crank : lonely protector of the true text . It 's a ridiculous role ? and it 's amazing how much work it offers . Perhaps the most famous statement in the history of rock ' n ' roll is a line spoken by a woman named Marion Keisker , who in the early 1950s was the co-manager of Sun Records in Memphis , Tennessee . She was quoting her boss , Sam Phillips , as she remembered him speaking in 1952 or 1953 , when he made his living recording black blues singers : " If I could find a white man with the Negro sound and the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make a billion dollars . " A year or so later , she and Phillips discovered Elvis Presley . Now , this statement is subject to all the uncertainties of oral history . Today , Sam Phillips denies he ever said any such thing ? " it makes it sound like I only cared about money . " he says . Marion Keisker herself says she said Phillips said " a million , " not " a billion . " ' But the interview with Keisker was taped , and you can examine it at the library at Memphis State University . Still , this too is outside the circuit of institutional significance which is why a writer named Albert Goldman , by far the most widely read biographer of Elvis Presley , could , for his own purposes , alter the statement , still attributing it to Sam Phillips , still placing it in quotes : " If I could find a white boy who sang like a nigger , I could make a billion dollars . " Those obnoxious , libelous words were published in 1981 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Phillips never used the word " nigger , " in any way , in any context ? from all evidence , he was n't that kind of man . The new version has entered into history : in this book , in that book , in utterly respectable hooks . Sent proofs of one such hook , I wrote the publisher , 22 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/DECEMBER 1988 pointing out the error , insisting on its seriousness . The publisher wrote back and explained that the author was sure the Goldman version was correct because it was " more vulgar , " and in the history of popular music , " vulgarity is always closer to the truth . " Another crank story : in 1969 I was part of the team at Rolling Stone magazine preparing a report on the Rolling Stones ' free concert at Altamont . At the end of their epochal 1969 tour , the Rolling Stones , feeling small after the Woodstock Festival , at which they had declined to appear , decided to mount a festival of their own . Three hundred thousand people showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning ? there was violence in the air . The Hell 's Angels had been hired to guard the stage . There was violence all day ? the people in the crowd were mean , selfish . Everyone waited for the last act . The last act was the cold-blooded murder of Meredith Hunter , a black Berkeley teenager , by the Hell 's Angels . He got too close to the stage ; the Hell 's Angels chased him away from it ; one caught him , stabbed him , stabbed him again ; then the teenager pulled a gun . He was running away from the stage at the time . The Hell 's Angels chased him back toward the stage , caught him , and beat him to death . The gun was never fired . That is what actually happened , though the context of the incident was trickier to establish . We reported that the killing had taken place as the Rolling Stones played " Sympathy for the Devil . " We had a bad tape of the show ? of course there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " But in truth it sounded as if it had : because it was poetically appropriate . A murder at a Rolling Stones concert as they played " Sympathy for the Devil " ? what could be more perfect ? We found out , not long after , that we were wrong : the killing happened during a different , less poetically appealing song ( not that less appealing ? it was " Under My Thumb " ) . There was no doubt ? movie footage had captured the event . In the movie Gim me Shelter , millions saw it happen . So we set the record straight , right away ? we ran a correction , and not just a line but a story , since it seemed important . But neither the correction nor the movie ever had any effect . Every time Altamont was mentioned , so was the killing that had taken place during " Sympathy for the Devil . " We became somewhat obsessed ; we ran a lot of corrections . The error never went away . We got tired of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we joked about running a cover story : some famous photo from Altamont , and a simple headline : NOT " SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL , " " UNDER MY THUMB . " But this was an error that could not be corrected . " Even if it did n't happen , " the editor finally said , " it did . " What he meant was this : when an event takes place outside of the strictures of power , it is swallowed by the imperatives of history , which are partly the imperatives of myth . History is a story : we want a story that makes sense , that is poetically whole , that fits what we already think we already know . This is what happens when a historian , after a hundred hours in the microfilm room , decides to omit a reported incident that contradicts her thesis , because no one will ever care that she omitted it ? or when a historian , faced with a plainly dishonest testimony , elides a phrase and invents a quote . They are not exactly lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course this is far less likely to happen when the history in question is attached to power ? when one knows it will be checked . But if one is pursuing a different story , a story that is not about power , one is safe . This is the temptation of history : who has n't felt it ? Today , it is a fact that at Altamont a murder , or anyway a killing ? there was a trial , and the defendant was found not guilty ? took place during " Sympathy for the Devil , " even though , at the trial , whatever it was that happened certifiably took place during " Under My Thumb . " More documents ? and irrelevant . Who , writing about Altamont , feels a responsibility to the event ? Sam Phillips said whatever he said ? and even though his statement , or Marion Keisker 's account of it , is a foundation stone of worldwide popular culture , we now have an obscene perversion of what he did or did n't say imbedded in , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . As for Mario Savio 's words ? well , they define a moment of danger , in all of its weakness , all of its passion . They would , anyway , if anyone had bothered to get them right . As they actually appear , they define nothing . Imagine that today Mario Savio is the attorney general of the United States . There would be little question of the misquotation of words he had uttered twenty-some years before : those words would be seen to have had consequences , they would be taken as a clue to his successes and failures , his perspicacity and his blindness , and rightly so . He would be accountable to the words he once said ? and rightly so . History is finally a matter of accountability : a good historian can bring all of us up on trial . We are all accountable to what we have seen and done , to what shaped us , to what made our place and time . In a good history , we are not permitted to get it wrong , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good historian will challenge us when we forget , when we elide , when we invent : the historian will have the documents , and we will have to face them . I was wrong , we will say , shamed by the evidence , and explain why ; no matter what , we will say , I was right , and explain that , too , if we can .
