Photomaton <P> " The average inventor has a hard life and it is a rare instance for him to reap the rewards of his invention as I have done . " So said one Anatol Josepho of New York last week , a few moments after pocketing a slip of paper upon which were written the idyllic figures $1,000,000 . His invention was a " quarter-in-the-slot " machine . Out of it comes , not gum or hairpins , but a strip of eight sepia photographs , each 2 in. x 1 in. , showing the quarter-dropper in whatever eight poses it has pleased him to strike . The pictures are photographed direct upon sensitized paper . To make a strip of eight pictures requires only eight minutes . A syndicate of men successful enough to know a real gold brick when they see one-including onetime Ambassador to Turkey Henry Morgenthau-had bought Inventor Josepho 's device . <P> Inventor Josepho , who is a Socialist only three years removed from penniless Russian immigrancy , will act consistently . Half of his million he will devote to general charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . "
