NEW YORK  --  European American Bancorp posted a $137. 7 million loss in the second quarter , among the largest quarterly losses ever for a U.S. bank holding company . The loss by European American , which is owned by six major European banks , stemmed from $137. 8 million in write-offs , mostly from bad loans , and a $110. 1 million addition to its depleted reserves for possible loan losses . In the year-earlier second quarter , European American earned $10. 2 million . The loss also caused the six parent banks to add $80 million in capital to European American , the latest in a series of infusions totaling $290 million  --  $125 million since the start of 1983 . European American ' s huge quarterly loss reflects efforts by its new chairman and chief executive , Raymond J. Dempsey , to wipe large amounts of bad loans off the bank ' s books as soon as possible . Mr. Dempsey , chairman since March , said in an interview that the loss closes the chapter on the bank ' s ill-fated attempt to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a regional bank , playing to our strengths , which are the consumer and middle market in New York City and Long Island , " he said . The bank ' s problems also are the latest example of foreign banks stumbling in their acquisitions of U.S. banks . Earlier this year , Crocker National Corp. , which is 57% owned by Midland Bank PLC of London , reported a first-quarter loss of $120. 8 million . Midland also is one of the owners of European American , though yesterday Midland said it had entered into talks with the other owner banks to reduce its 20% stake . The other owners of European American are Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V. , the Netherlands ; Creditanstalt-Bankverein , Austria ; Deutsche Bank AG , West Germany ; Societe Generale de Banque S.A. , Belgium , and Societe Generale , France . European American , parent of European American Bank &; Trust Co. , doesn ' t appear to be in danger of collapsing , given the sizable resources of its European owners . And Mr. Dempsey insisted that the bank is poised for growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , predicting that European American would earn about $35 million to $40 million in the second half of this year , aided by real estate sales and other nonrecurring gains . But the bank still is saddled with nonperforming loans totaling $296. 1 million , or 5. 2% of total loans , compared with a median 2. 8% for similar-sized banks , according to Cates Consulting Analysts . Those nonperforming loans include " virtually all " of the bank ' s $58 million of Argentine loans , Mr. Dempsey said . Moreover , there have been persistent rumors that some of the company ' s shareholder banks want to pull out . The second-quarter loss is especially striking given the size of European American , which had assets of $8. 7 billion at year-end 1983 and ranked 32nd among U.S. bank holding companies . By contrast , InterFirst Corp. of Dallas , which posted a $194 million loss in the 1983 third quarter , had year-end 1983 assets of $21. 7 billion . Crocker has assets of $23. 4 billion . European American was formed in 1968 in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand in the U.S. In 1974 , it took over the assets of insolvent Franklin National Bank , at that time the largest bank ever to fail in the U.S. But European American ' s attempts to expand its lending and other activities beyond New York and become a big-league bank foundered . For one thing , the consortium ' s shareholders didn ' t cooperate with each other and failed to provide direction for the bank ' s drifting management . They also set up their own individual operations in the U.S. , bypassing European American and sometimes competing for the same business . In addition , bank officials acknowledge that they neglected European American ' s local franchise in the New York City area and Long Island , inherited from Franklin . For example , until recently , the bank had at least four times as many lending officers outside the New York area as inside . " We never made use of the strengths of Franklin , " one top bank official said . As a result , the bank stretched itself too thin , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect , were of poor quality . Mr. Dempsey said the bank ' s writeoffs included real estate loans , chiefly in the Southwest and West , loans to Western energy drilling and production companies , loans to the now-depressed New York diamond industry , plus international loans . European American , moreover , appears to have been setting aside far too little money in its loan-loss reserves . The $110. 1 million addition to those reserves in the second quarter is ten times the $11. 1 million added in the first quarter . Mr. Dempsey said the bank is being " more conservative , " but Irene Booker , a Cates Consulting vice president , said that European American ' s financial data " suggest the bank was procrastinating in recognizing sub-par loans . " Mr. Dempsey said the bank has disbanded its merchant banking operation and is closing lending offices in Chicago and Los Angeles . Some of European American ' s problems were unrelated to lending . The bank spent large amounts of money to develop its own computer system , which didn ' t work . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank has taken a $42 million write-off on the development costs , including $34 million in the second quarter . Mr. Dempsey , who came to European American after establishing a reputation for engineering a financial turnaround at Philadelphia ' s Fidelity Bank , said that John B. Lowe Jr. , chief financial officer , and Donald L. Keane , a senior vice president , both " resigned . " They follow Harry E. Ekblom , the former chairman and chief executive , who left the bank in December . In the second quarter , European American had net loan charge-offs of $110. 1 million . It also had additional net charge-offs of $27. 7 million , which included the computer write-off . The loss for the first six months of 1984 was $135. 7 million . In the 1983 first six months , European American earned $18 million . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
