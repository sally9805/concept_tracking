If they can tear themselves away from the platform debates , delegates just might discover something they can all agree on : Atlanta has become a diverting place in which to eat . As it has blossomed into a cosmopolitan city , it has spawned restaurants that serve more than the down-home fare associated with the South . Even so , visitors should first sample the native cuisine . That includes such obvious specialties as crunchy fried chicken with livers and other giblets , fork-tender country-fried steak , braised pork chops , fried catfish and black-eyed peas . To these are added local esoterica like potlikker , a bracing broth that results from cooking pork with greens and is best accented with a dash of Tabasco . Small wonder that to some this is known as soul food . <P> Rewarding pickings can be found at Paschal 's , near downtown , a coffee shop and restaurant that has been a meeting place for black politicians since the early ' 60s , where the fried chicken is at its crackling , greaseless best . Also dependably authentic are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the seedily relaxed Thelma 's Kitchen , which is within walking distance of the Omni Arena . Careful eaters , however , should avoid two hyped , touristic embarrassments : the schmaltzy , pricey Pittypat 's Porch and the dank , depressing Aunt Fanny 's Cabin . <P> The best specimens of barbecued beef , chopped pork and baby back ribs are at Aleck 's Barbeque Heaven , a tiny tumbledown shack that slices up lean , tender meat flavored with counterpoints of woodsy smoke and black pepper , complemented by a thin , brassy sauce unmarred by sweetness . Runners-up include the Auburn Avenue Rib Shack , in the historic black downtown area of Sweet Auburn , and Harold 's Barbeque , the site of the best-quality meats , the most comfortable dining room and , sadly , the stickiest , sweetest sauce . <P> For a taste of the real Atlanta , every delegate should " drop a dog at the Varsity . " This sprawling landmark is where the pillars of society line up with hoi polloi for chili-topped hot dogs , cayenne-zapped onion rings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local journalists at play , conventioneers can go to Manuel 's Tavern , the spot for cold beer , spicy Buffalo chicken wings , lusty chili and burgers . <P> Although Atlanta is hardly on the cutting edge of innovative cookery , it does have several elegant and creditable outposts of haute Continental cuisine . At the top of the list is 103 West . It is discouraging at first glance , gussied up with enough faux-everything kitsch to make one wish for a machete to clear a path to a table . However , once one is seated , delights appear , marred only occasionally by a lax waiter or an overdone duck . There are sublimely puffy lump-crabmeat cakes and tender veal chops with morels . Not to be missed : profiteroles filled with foie gras . The kitchen also serves an original version of pot-au-feu for which the succulently moist , tarragon- scented chicken arrives with leeks and angel-hair pasta , not in the traditional bowl with soup but on a plate mantled with a cream-and-chicken- stock sauce .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
