As the great organ thundered beneath the medieval arches of England 's Canterbury Cathedral , 525 bishops last week joined in a sung Eucharist to conclude the Lambeth Conference , the once-a-decade meeting of the international Anglican hierarchy . The bishops ' matching robes of red , white and black gave a superficial impression of unity , as did the compromise measures they had enacted . " Some thought this conference was impossible . Reason and experience suggested we would fall apart . But by keeping our eyes on the Lord , we have not sunk , " said a relieved Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie , the Anglicans ' spiritual leader . <P> Though the latest Lambeth Conference ( named after the Archbishop 's palace in London ) did not sink , there is rough water ahead for the Anglican Communion , with its 60 million believers . Vast cultural differences are straining the customary tolerance within this family of 27 self-governing branches , which span 164 countries . One sign of this diversity was the simultaneous translation of Lambeth sessions into French , Spanish , Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine , liturgy , ecumenical relations , abortion , divorce , polygamy , homosexuality and violent revolution . <P> Most divisive of all is the place of women . While the Episcopal Church in the U.S. and Anglicans in Canada and New Zealand have ordained 1,257 women priests since the 1970s , much of Anglicanism is not ready for that step and refuses to recognize the ordained women . Such an encroachment of women 's lib upon church doctrine is positively " satanic , " declared a bishop from Melanesia , where women do not even dine with men . <P> Despite such resistance , the more liberal Anglican branches are now determined to go beyond women priests and consecrate women as bishops . The opposition to this step is formidable : 40% of the conference voted in favor of an Australian 's motion to stall elections of women bishops . Nonetheless , facing up to the inevitable , the meeting decided to let each branch do as it pleases and then directed Runcie to appoint a commission to deal with the resulting disputes . <P> The aggressive U.S. delegation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it represents only 4% of the world 's Anglicans ) , worked fervently to promote the women 's cause . Dozens of Americans and Canadians refused to celebrate Communion services while in England , where women are not allowed to serve as priests . Nan Peete of Indianapolis became the first female priest to address a Lambeth session and won a standing ovation , from half the audience , for her eloquent words . " In a world that rejected me and denied me my humanity based on my race , " said Peete , who is black , " the church was the place I turned for sanctuary . " Now , she added , feelings of rejection " come back when I am not accepted as a priest , this time because of my sex . " <P> Bishops from the fast-growing Anglican churches in Africa and Asia had differing views on women but united to confront the West on other issues . The most striking example was a decision to end long-standing church teaching against the baptism of polygamists . The Africans said the traditional stand cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in polygamous societies will be allowed to keep their wives if they forswear further marriages .
