Palace advisers and Cabinet officials are plotting a cautious , moderate course . On another front , these officials have cast a wide net to secure funds needed to underwrite Jordan ' s transition to economic self-sufficiency. // ' ' If ( the King ) champions reform - real reform - he will stop the erosion , become more popular , and regain legitimacy , ' ' says Asad Abdul-Rahman , director of the Schoman Foundation , a research institute in Amman . ' ' The alternative is more dangerous. ' ' // // Jordan still simmers with discontent beneath the surface following rioting in April , the worst in 20 years . Demands for greater political rights were catalyzed by economic woes brought on by two decades of high living on borrowed funds . April ' s unrest rocked one of the most stable , pro-Western regimes in the Arab world. // Two months later , Jordanian officials acknowledge that the rioting , which left seven Jordanians dead , came as a surprise , exposing a level of public alienation that was completely unexpected. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Jordanian official who , like others interviewed , was critical of the previous government for being cut off from public opinion and for leaving the country in the dark about the severity of Jordan ' s economic crisis. // After the riots , King Hussein reshuffled the government , replacing Prime Minister Zaid al-Rifai with the King ' s cousin , former Army chief Zeid Bin Shaker . Mr. Rifai was blamed for leading Jordan into a financial quagmire amid rumors that top officials were lining their pockets with commissions from arms deals. // Meanwhile , officials of the new government have disclosed that Jordan ' s foreign debt ( $8. 2 billion ) is 20 percent higher than previously stated , while a third of the nation ' s gold reserves was secretly sold off to purchase the foreign currency to keep up repayments. // As part of what one official calls a ' ' total overhauling of the country , ' ' sources in Amman speak of plans to democratize the government and streamline administrative procedures. // The crucial test will come when the government decides whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary elections in over 20 years. // Skeptics note that the King has dangled the carrot of elections before , only to take it away when political pressures have ebbed. // But despite pockets of resistance to the idea both in and outside the government , government sources confidently predict balloting as early as October , pending the clarification of issues such as the number of delegates , voting age , and electoral districts. // In the meantime , Jordan will have to cope with high debts and growing unemployment created after aid and foreign remittances from the Gulf Arab states fell off after the collapse of the oil boom. // The unenviable task ahead will be to maintain a floor of basic government services to low-income families as the country makes the difficult transition toward reliance on its embryonic light industry and underperforming tourism sectors. // Jordan will have to bear the added weight of a five-year austerity program imposed by the International Monetary Fund as a precondition to IMF and World Bank loans needed for debt rescheduling . To ease the burden , Jordan expects an influx of financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency aid and $40 million worth of crude oil already committed by Kuwait. // If the Gulf aid and increased export revenues generated by last year ' s devaluation of the Jordanian dinar fail to dent deficits , Jordan could be forced to make further budget cuts at the expense of such key constituencies as soldiers and civil servants. // ' ' That will touch a raw nerve politically , ' ' says a diplomatic source here , referring to the possibility of new outbreaks of rioting. // Political analysts point out that last April ' s rioting was unique since it was the first time civil unrest in Jordan had not been instigated or abetted by outside forces , as happened with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1970. // ' ' It ' s the first time the clash is directly between the people and the King , ' ' says former Cabinet minister Jamal Shair. // The result has been to politicize and energize the King ' s normally passive subjects , many of whom have thrown themselves into the task of urging on the government a pragmatic program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' The barrier of fear has collapsed , ' ' says a Jordanian journalist who describes the unrest as a watershed in Jordan ' s history . ' ' People are much more aware of their power to make change . They ' re saying enough is enough. ' ' // All of which has created an unaccustomed dilemma for Hussein. // Fueled by charges of government corruption and mismanagement , the riots came closer than ever before to tarnishing the King ' s personal reputation . Pamphlets and communiques issued recently by political groups and professional associations have contained unprecedented warnings that without reforms the King ' s credibility as the backbone as national unity could be shaken. // But after 35 years of absolute power , learning to share control will prove difficult for the diminutive monarch. // The predictable result , say several observers , is likely to be just enough reform to get by . But the King is not likely to embrace a new concept of government that would , for example , replace sycophantic palace advisers with a genuine Cabinet government or decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Such awkward compromises are now epitomized by new press freedoms which have given the country ' s three major Arabic dailies somewhat wider rein while leaving them under the control of directors appointed by the government last year. // ' ' We ' re not feeling any real change , ' ' says one academic source who , despite Jordan ' s incipient period of glasnost , said it was too dangerous to be quoted by name. // More crucial is the matter of parliamentary elections , which some of the King ' s advisers are queasy about since they pose the risk of elevating Muslim fundamentalists and other dissidents to positions of political power. // Political observers say the government ' s commitment to reform will be be meaningful only if all candidates are allowed to run , with freedom to campaign and with full access to the media , and only if the new parliament is allowed to function without constraint . Hussein dissolved the lower house last year and has not allowed political parties in Jordan since 1957. // ' ' Elections are important : but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , ' ' says the Jordanian journalist. // //
