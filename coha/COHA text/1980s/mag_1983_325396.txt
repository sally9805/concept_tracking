COVER STORY <P> Is the U.S. making the right moves toward Moscow in arms control ? <P> <P> Ronald Reagan had been beset before by political defeats and disarray , but never in such a cherished domain of his Administration . Whatever his struggles and stumbles on the economy and social issues , the President had always managed to press his program for national defense with seemingly unassailable determination and confidence . Yet last week-in Congress , public opinion and international negotiations-it was precisely his efforts to strengthen and protect the nation 's military security that were in trouble . <P> In a stunning repudiation , the Senate Budget Committee cut in half the 10.7% real increase in next year 's defense spending on which Reagan had insisted " as a minimum . " The rebuff was all the more startling because eight members of the Republican majority on the committee joined the Democrats in voting against the Administration . <P> Nor did a rescue seem any closer for the beleaguered MX missile , a prime object of congressional skepticism and budget cutting . A blue-ribbon bipartisan presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser to President Gerald Ford , is expected to recommend this week that production and deployment of the MX proceed . But Congressmen briefed on the commission 's report predicted a tough fight with no assurance that the President will win . The only slight relief the White House could find in the reaction to the MX was a decision by the nation 's Roman Catholic bishops to revise a pastoral letter on the morality of nuclear weapons , dropping a specific objection to the missile and softening their implicit criticism of Administration policy . Meanwhile , a resolution calling for a nuclear arms freeze , which Reagan vehemently opposes , was expected to pass in the House . <P> The lawmakers seemed to be representing a growing discontent on the part of their constituents . Public-opinion polls showed that confidence in Reagan 's handling of foreign and defense policies had actually fallen during his monthlong hard-sell campaign on behalf of those policies . Some White House officials privately lamented that the President 's " Darth Vader " speech of March 8 , in which he denounced the U.S.S.R. as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 23 , in which he proposed what is widely regarded as a futile campaign to develop antimissile defenses , may have backfired . <P> The President has sought to reassure the public by pursuing nuclear arms control with the Soviet Union , so far with scant success . Reagan 's chief negotiator in the intermediate-range nuclear forces ( INF ) , or Euromissile , talks , Paul Nitze , last week gave the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a nonprogress report . Despite Reagan 's proposal for an " interim solution " in INF , Nitze held out little hope for a negotiated settlement before new U.S. missiles are scheduled for installation in Western Europe later this year . Edward Rowny was equally grim in his report to the committee on Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) , for which he is chief negotiator . After sitting through Nitze 's and Rowny 's back-to-back appearances , Democratic Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts pronounced it " the most distressing session " on arms control he had attended in his four years in         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
