txt In a last-minute attempt to head off what he believed would be the creation of a financially crippled conglomerate , Bendix Corp . ' s chairman , William M. Agee , says Bendix offered to assume all legal risks for Martin Marietta Corp . officers and directors if they would agree to a friendly merger . The offer was contained in a letter Mr. Agee gave to Martin Marietta 's chairman , Thomas Pownall , after the Marietta board , Mr. Agee says , kept him cooling his heels for hours in a Bethesda , Md. , roadside motel . In the end , Mr. Agee said , the Marietta board refused even to hear him out on his ideas for how a friendly merger tould create a financially vital concern . In an interview , Mr. Agee recounted his side of the month-long takeover battle that ended Friday when Allied Corp . agreed to buy Bendix and a minority position in Marietta . The Bendix chairman said he was repeatedly frustrated in his efforts to work out a friendly arrangement with Marietta . He attributed much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials of the Maryland defense contractor . " It was like dealing with the Russians . We kept saying , here we are , here we are , we want to do it . " Marietta would seem interested " and then all of a sudden we 'd hear nothing , " Mr. Agee said . Despite that , however , the Bendix chairman said he did n't realize a friendly merger was impossible until the night before Bendix struck its initial agreement to be acquired by Allied . Mr. Pownall was unavailable for comment on Mr. Agee 's remarks in the weekend interview . A Marietta spokesman said the chairman " has dropped off the scope for the weekend . " The spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Agee 's account of events . On Friday , though , Marietta issued a statement saying company 's directors and management had acted in the best interests of shareholders . The Maryland company previously had said it was willing to discuss a combination of the companies , but using Marietta 's proposal to acquire Bendix as a basis of discussion . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most afraid of was the possibility that Bendix and Mari- etta would wind up owning each other , depleting their assets and running up their debt load , to the harm of each . " There was no way I was going to allow that stalemate to be there , " Mr. Agee said he told the Bendix board . " I said I would go to all lengths to avoid that . " Mr. Agee said that even before making a bid for Marietta , he knew his unsolicited offer would be viewed as " quasi unfriendly . I expected the initial reaction to be : ' Okay , we do n't like it . But let 's get together and see what can be talked out . ' " Instead Marietta went on the attack , launching its counter tender offer for shares of Bendix . Even then , Mr. Agee said he believed that he could prevail . He made a number of attempts to reach Mr. Pownall to offer to " sit down and work something out as rational business people . " Mr. Agee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several letters and issued public statements expressing his interest in negotiations . Finally , Mr. Agee obtained a meeting with Mr. Pownall , who invited Mr. Agee to speak to the Marietta board in Bethesda , Md . Mr. Agee and several advisers arrived in Bethesda last Tuesday in time for a 2:15 p.m. presentation to the board , at which Mr. Agee intended to argue that the directors were n't giving enough weight to the interests of the Maryland company 's shareholders . But while Mr. Agee waited at a nearby motel , he said the call to appear before the board was repeatedly delayed . After several hours , he said he was summoned to Marietta headquarters , only to find that the board had adjourned . At that point . Mr. Agee said he was told by Mr. Pownall that " ternble legal problems " stood in the way of a friendly merger . It was then that Mr. Agee presented Mr. Pownall with a letter that offered $55 a share for Marietta 's remaining shares and promised to absorb any legal liabilities of Marietta directors and executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of Bendix . Mr. Agee says the Marietta officials had told him that they were worried because , he says , they had n't left themselves a legal escape clause in their offer , giving them protection in case of lawsuits . But , according to Mr. Agee , that did n't seem to help . He then recalls saying , " Let 's see if we ca n't figure out another solution to this legal problem , whatever it is . " After talking with Mr. Pownall for about an hour , Mr. Agee said he departed , along with his advisers . On the road to the airport , Mr. Agee decided to turn back for another try . Telephoning from a service station , he says he told Mr. Pownall that he wanted to come back , and Mr. Pownall agreed . After another three hours of talks , Mr. Agee said he concluded that , if Mr. Pownall " really wanted a deal , we 'd be writing the papers . " The next morning , Mr. Agee began the final negotiations with Allied Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planned merger of Bendix and Allied . Mr. Agee said he chose that course because " when you look at the lengths to which Martin Marietta would go to avoid a takeover , it was a situation in which you had to ask : What price victory ? I was not prepared to bet the company . And I think that what we have done is a victory . "
