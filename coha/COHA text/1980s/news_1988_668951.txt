When Bob Thomas was booting footballs for the Bears some years ago , you didn ' t worry for him when a field-goal attempt zigged instead of zagged . You suspected that when he was done playing games and put real shoes on , he wouldn ' t need a squared toe to point him in the right direction . You figured he ' d split life ' s uprights , so to speak . What you didn ' t know was that someday you ' d be asked to stand whenever he enters a room . After all , the last time you saw Thomas in a robe , he was coming out of the shower at Soldier Field , trying to dry his hair before the linemen took up all the mirror . Then Thomas would stroll over to his locker , where he ' d be asked about real pressing issues , such as please describe the crosswind on that last extra point . Now , though , he ' s not No. 16 on your scorecard anymore , with a " PK " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside your thumb to tell you where he learned to set his sights higher than the crossbar . Heck , now he ' s not even Bob Thomas anymore . At least not when he ' s on the job , his new job . " What do I call you now ? " we asked the other day . " Same as before , " he replied . " Anything but collect . " What you call him now , before you call him Bob Thomas , is Your Honor . By a big margin , with something like 70 percent of the vote , he won a seat on the Du Page County Circuit Court , did Judge Bob Thomas last Tuesday . This is analogous to nailing a three-pointer from midfield and clearing it by 10 yards . With plenty to spare , as they say . He got all of it . No doubt about it . Apparently , the public at large recognized His Honor for what he is , a qualified political type who doesn ' t have to put on a helmet and point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du Page County Bar Association took care of that matter a couple of years ago , anyway , when it recommended Bob Thomas for an associate judgeship . Not that he didn ' t encounter some gentle reminders during a grueling campaign about his first claim to fame . " There was one time when I was in a grocery store , " His Honor related . " And a fellow walked up to me and looked at me and said , ' Didn ' t you used to be Bob Thomas ? ' That sort of thing . You play that long for what is now the most publicized team in football , maybe in all of professional sports , and you can ' t help but have that type of image as the ex-athlete . " We tried to play it down , and I think my Democratic opponent might have gone the other way , saying that ' s all I was , that I was inexperienced . I was a field-goal kicker as recently as a couple of years ago , true . But I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in 1981 . One can prepare you for the other . I ' ve been under public and media scrutiny for the last 16 years . I ' ve been booed by 60 , 000 people . " Ask Judge Bob Thomas what ' s more taxing , though , and it ' s no contest . Would he rather be at the left hashmark with a game on the line ? Or would he opt for a suburban train station at five in the morning , shaking hands , seeking support ? He ' ll cite the latter for greater degree of difficulty , because you can somewhat govern the flight of a football . But the ballot box is out of your control , at least if you ' re running for office outside Chicago . You present your case , and you await the verdict , often with a feeling of helplessness . Indeed , sports can inspire some tense moments , instances when you wish you could hide under a small rock in the fishbowl . But with each Sunday and with each season , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you drop the flag on somebody for illegal procedure , there tends to be a more significant impact . " We all get carried away a little bit with the importance of games , " Judge Thomas said . " I ' m watching TV the other day , and one of the sportscasters called a fumble ' tragic . ' That ' s a little strong . Football humbled me in many ways . Sports is good that way , teaching you how to deal with pressure . Being a judge , you have to have logic under pressure . As everybody stands up , it ' s easy to think of yourself as too important , just like when you read your press clippings after a good game . But the robes aren ' t so much an indication of a judge ' s authority as his awesome responsibility . I don ' t ever want to forget that . I hope the position I ' m in won ' t ever change my personality or my ability to deal with people . " Rest assured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had his best season with the Bears in 1984 , collecting 101 points , but was cut the following year to make way for rookie Kevin Butler . Thomas was crushed . Asked why , he said then : " Because this team is going to win the Super Bowl . " His instincts were correct . A year later , he was with the New York Giants , but he tore up his ankle . They went all the way without him , too . " I was fortunate , though , because I came away from professional football with more than a closet full of clothes and a nice car , " said Judge Thomas . But you knew he would . And he should be rid of sportswriters now , too . Upon being installed , he will handle civil matters involving only sums of $15 , 000 or more.
