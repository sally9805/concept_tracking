Custer 's battlefield yields clues to old mysteries <P> On the afternoon of June 25,1876 , with guns blazing and sandy hair shining , Lieut . Colonel George Armstrong Custer , along with some 220 of the troopers under his command , was massacred near Montana 's Little Bighorn River . The secrets of his last stand against more than 2,500 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors were buried with him . There were no white survivors to tell the tale , but plenty of folks back East were ready to propel Custer directly into legend as a straight-shooting hero . The years have only served to embellish the myths and mysteries . <P> Now 30 archaeologists , historians and war buffs are braving rattlesnakes and ticks to help set the record straight about perhaps the least documented shootout in U.S. history . They are brandishing metal detectors and trowels in a foot-by-foot survey of the historic ground . One reason there has never been a thorough investigation of the battlefield is that until last August it was covered by two-foot-tall stands of buffalo grass .

With so few clues , there are all sorts of unanswered questions : Did Custer die on the gentle hill where his body was found , or by the river as Indian tales say ? Did the last troopers , as Indian veterans claimed , commit suicide to avoid being tortured ? " The myths around Custer and the battle have become much bigger than the facts , " says Vine Deloria , a Sioux author . " This could help set the record straight . " <P> The discoveries so far have revealed fresh details . Hundreds of shells from the troopers ' Springfield carbines and the Indians ' Henry .44-cal. rifles have been numbered , bagged and plotted on maps . The shells have established previously unknown skirmish lines and indicated that by battle 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Investigators plan next to focus on the fate of the 37 men of E Company who died in battle . Many experts believe Custer sent them to protect his left flank . Others claim they were rushing from the slaughter through a gulch called Deep Ravine . Mounds exposed by the fire will be excavated . Any skeletons found will be examined for powder burns , which might indicate suicide . <P> Montanans are used to Custer controversy . The Crow Indians , who hold most of the 9,000 privately owned acres slicing through the battlefield , leased land for the 1969 filming of Little Big Man , which portrayed Custer as a grandiose madman . Monument boosters who prefer a more sober-eyed version of the hero are trying to raise $8 million to buy the land . <P> The results of the current cataloguing , scheduled to continue into next month , will eventually be published . Will they offer definitive answers ? Unlikely . " We will create some new questions , " thinks Montana Archaeologist Richard Fox .
