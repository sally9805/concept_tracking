txt A poet , whose collection , " Sad-Faced Men , " will be published In Junef illiam Wharton 's second novel , which follows the high-wire performance of " Birdy " ( 1979 ) , is ' a severe and beautitut acnievement forged from the appalling distortions of family life . Psychological obsession was the focus of his previous novel , but in " Dad " an the obsessions are projected outward , existing in players and place ; and the narrator , an expatriate painter , is a rational , though ' not unaffected , center . Returning to pastel , stucco Los Angeles to help his mother recover from a heart attack , he finds himself instead nursing his brilliant but disastrously withdrawn father . The ! first terror of this novel is the futility , of love , its ( inability to counter the effects of time and distance ; the second is the terrible human cost of ' sacrificing one 's spirit to another .

At home Jack Tremont , the narrator , ' discovers his ' father leached of his being by years of his wife 's domination .

The most brutal sections of the novel describe Jack 's attempt to , bring his father home and care ' for him , though ' Dad has become by turns savage and vegetative , a man stripped of civilization and intelligence , a wild boy . The first night , Dad smears himself and his room with excrement : Only after Jack admits the vanity of accepting the burdens of care does his father , having been transferred to a convalescent home , suffer a miraculous , re-juvenescent recovery . Each gain in this novel exacts a penalty , add in the , final sections this penalty is the discovery of Dad 's complex imaginative world , a 30-yearold secret life that leads finally to his disintegration . ' Every generation must accept the scars of its adaptations to circumstance , and the limits such adaptations demand . The movement of the story is toward death , toward the state where losses are frozen and irrecoverable . In this respect the novel is disheartening . But there is a counter-movement , and another Dad the narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles with his son Billy , a college drop-opt . Much of the novel 's ambition and proportion derives from the counterpoint of these road chapters and the struggle between generation and generation in Los Angeles . These chapters of ' difficult kinship establish a new bond between a father and a son , even as age and illness dissolve an old one . Further , chapters from Billy 's point of view identify the biases of his father 's narration , even as the contrast in scene provides relief from the parental fury . Wharton takes advantage of extreme situations by making them part of the possible error of existence . The extremities of emotion find expression in extremities of situation , and so a Philadelphia whorehouse , a highway accident , and a tacky roadside attraction , incorporated without clinical description or exaggeration , are not showy set-pieces but advances in a drama of real lives in unreal places . Similarly , a splendid array of minor characters , observed without detachment , has heartening imaginative life . In this handling of extremes " Dad " most closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ravages of age are visited so suddenly on this quiet family that its fate seems inevitable and Greek . Wharton'a unornamented prose itself seems inescapable , sacrificing poetic effect to the emotional urge of events and the manners of dialog : One passage may suggest the rhythms he has chosen to establish these exterior lives . Dad is justifying his taste in Salvation Army clothing : " All the rich people I 've seen on television wear.crazy clothes . They do n't lave to please anybody except themselves and they do n't care what purple think of them ; they 're already rich . Now I do n't need anything from anybody either . I 'll buy them .

If the novel , essentially self-revelatory , does not finally cohere , it is because Billy is a less complex and less revealing narrator than his father , and because the lighter road scenes do not work with the force of the counterpoint scenes in " Birdy . " The reader , ' though often off balance , is not pressured chapter after , chapter . The portrait of the artist , however , caught between his youth and his age , between ' one generation ' and another ( with even his family name an emblem of the'separate generations ) , is one of the most fully formed in contemporary fiction . This study of the cost of understanding ? where no character can understand others except at the risk of comprehending his own ignorance ? gives rare emotional satisfaction . The perfection of a tragicomic novel resides not in failing to inspire pity and terror ? there is some of both in " Dad " ? but in fulfilling more completely a different duty , to heal , and dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
