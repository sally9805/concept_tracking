The only way Bob Brigham used to know that George Bush was in town was when his daughter would return from Bradbury Brothers Market and announce , " The Filipinos are here . " This meant that the Vice President 's household staff was preparing for his arrival . Things change . " Now it looks like a damned convention for the hearing impaired , " observes Brigham , a local real estate agent , about the swarm of Secret Service men sporting earphones when Bush is in Kennebunkport . <P> For the record , it was on Wednesday , Nov. 23 , that Kennebunkport met its first metal detector . Bush was to address his friends and neighbors  --  folks like Booth Chick and Carl Bartlett  --  on the town green , and his security men set one up on Ocean Avenue to screen the audience . He had survived more than 60 summers in this lovely coastal Maine town without a single metal detector , but then he never was President-elect . Trouble was , there were too many people for the lone detector . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush began , and let everyone in to hear the speech . " We 're going to need more of them , " sighs Roland Drew , chairman of the board of selectmen . <P> It is going to get tricky . " I ca n't imagine anyone here calling him Mr. President , " predicts Bartlett , owner of Port Hardware . " It has always been ' Hi , George , how are you ? ' Hell , I 've never heard anyone call him Mr. Bush . " <P> Two days later , Bill Ward over at Port Video had a scare . He was having breakfast next door at Karens Restaurant when Bush arrived to rent a couple of videos , leading a 15-car motorcade of security and media people . " For a moment I thought my place was on fire , " Ward recalls . " It reminded me of the Monty Python movie where the kid opens the bedroom window and sees a lawn full . of people . It 's ridiculous for the press to follow Bush around to see what he buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Brace yourself , Bill , you are in summer White House country now . Weird things happen . Remember Plains , Ga. ? " If anyone spent a dime there , that was an improvement over the year before , " sniffs Ward . True enough . Plains shot into the limelight with Jimmy Carter and sunk back into the kudzu like Brigadoon . Then there was Hyannis , Mass. , which metamorphosed from a decent summer community into the world capital of turquoise John F. Kennedy ashtrays . The place has never recovered from the combination of Kennedy mystique , weak zoning and bad taste . <P> None of this is lost on Kennebunkport 's 4,500 natives . Many ponder their future at Alisson 's Restaurant , where fresh rumors mingle daily with the clam chowder . Someone murmurs that the Secret Service will close Ocean Avenue , the road that runs past the Bush compound on Walker 's Point , for security reasons . " If they do that , the cars will back up all the way to Wells , " moans Rick Griffin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching to a town seven miles away .
