The generous unemployment benefits paid out by the state , the auto companies and the Federal Government were not designed for two years of depressed car making and widespread layoffs. // Men and women who had learned patience from the cycles of the industry are learning that , this time , the jobs may never come back to the Detroit area . Automation and the shrinking size of cars mean that far fewer workers than before are needed to make each vehicle . And the growing dispersal of the auto industry to the Sun Belt and overseas has already left this city the " Motor City " in name only. // At last , union officials , social welfare experts and even politicians are beginning to talk openly about a subject that the auto makers have known about for some time : the likelihood that more than half of the 200 , 000 jobs on layoff status , most of them in the Detroit region , will never reopen , and that the best advice to the displaced workers is to give up , leave town and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ristoski and others like him , however , that advice is already too late . " Sure , I would move if I could find a job , but with what ? " he asked as he shuffled a litter of overdue bills and the smudged receipts for unemployment payments , the last one dated Feb. 9 , 1981. // " Where are we going to go with no money ? " he asked . " You want to sell your home to go someplace else , you can ' t sell it because nobody ' s got a job , nobody ' s got the money . " With no money for gasoline , he said , " I can ' t even leave the house to look for work. " // Mr. Ristoski , who is 42 years old , started work at Chrysler ' s Mack Avenue plant on May 14 , 1973 , a date that comes to his lips instantly , as though he recalls it daily . But he has to fumble a bit to remember Oct. 8 , 1979 , the day he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning its third year , bit into the ranks of the working. // His wife , Angelina , who worked for a small parts manufacturer , has not worked since last spring . The Ristoskis and their two sons were able to get by on the extensive unemployment benefits available to auto workers : unemployment compensation , and then extended benefits , then Trade Readjustment Assistance from the Federal Government , a recompense for jobs lost to imports , then supplemental unemployment benefits from Chrysler , as provided for in the United Automobile Workers contract , when regular unemployment ran out . <> <> Nobody Thought It Would Last // In all , Mr. Ristoski alone drew more than $14 , 000 in unemployment compensation from various sources . Like many others , he expected the upturn to come soon . But it did not. // " The problem is that nobody thought it would last , " said Richard F. Heugli , executive vice president of Detroit ' s United Community Services , an umbrella civic group that is active in helping the destitute. // " When some plants laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in other parts of the country and people said , ' Well , I ' ll be getting 85 percent of my pay and I ' ll be getting my S.U.B. and my T.R.A. , I ' ll stick around and take my chances on something turning up , because things always got better in the past. // " But this time it isn ' t going to be the same , and there aren ' t going to be those other jobs . " In 1980 and the first two months of 1981 , those benefits ran out for more than 152 , 000 workers and their families in the Detroit area alone . If past trends hold , that number is increasing by more than 10 , 000 a month. // According to Mayor Coleman A. Young , 60 percent of the 1. 2 million people in Detroit receive some kind of public aid , including Social Security . Enrollments in welfare programs in the Detroit region have grown by 64 , 000 people in the last year , all of them seeking the benefits of social aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What we are dealing with here are the new poor , " said Berkely Watterson , who operates the auto union ' s Community Services Department , " people who were once productive , middle-class people who have been out of work for so long they ' re no longer even statistics . " <> <> One Who Has Learned // Paul Robinson , 37 years old , a Ford trim plant worker for 12 years before he was laid off 18 months ago , is a statistic on the welfare rolls , and it hurts him. // " I ' m one of those guys who was gon na die before I put my family on welfare , right ? " he said with a try at a smile . " Well , I learned some things since those days , like you don ' t give a shoot what you got to do when you wake up some morning and the kids are hungry and you can ' t even buy a loaf of bread. " // Jacqueline Scherer , a sociology professor at Oakland University in Pontiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard their words of shock. // " I find an incredible ignorance about the way the welfare system works , " she said . " We ' ve built up all these myths about welfare cheaters and people on welfare living high on the hog , and when these workers go to qualify for welfare themselves they really hit the stark reality of how strict the rules for qualification are . They find out they ' re not eligible until they really get down on their knees. " // Even then things can go wrong , as they did for Mrs. Ristoski when she applied for welfare . The welfare department declared that the old house the Ristoskis once occupied in Detroit , and which they have repeatedly tried to sell since moving to a new home outside the city , was an asset that disqualified the family for aid , although the house has been empty for five months , since the last renter moved out . <> <> ' Am I Supposed to Eat My House ? ' // " They say , ' You got two houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ristoski said , her voice rich with indignation and the tones of her native Slovenian . " Am I supposed to eat my house ? " // Now all $2 , 400 the Ristoskis had saved is gone , the $60 gas bill and $17 for the telephone are overdue , and Mr. Ristoski owes his sister $500 he borrowed to make the April house payment . In their spotless suburban home they live on pancakes. // " Why should this happen to me ? " Mr. Ristoski exclaimed . " I work seven and a half years in one place , never late , never a complaint . The boss wants overtime , I work it - 10 , 12 hours , I don ' t care , I like to work . People who want to work should have a job. " // Asked why he waited so long to look for other work , Mr. Ristoski replied , " I thought they would call me back . " In fact , when he was laid off for several months in the auto slump of 1974 and 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard facts have not been put clearly to their rank and file , but time and the running out of the money are forcing a reluctant change. // " Who ' s going to admit that the jobs will never be there again ? " Mr. Watterson said . " It goes against all the images of growth and recovery that the Mayor and everyone wants to project . They ' re so used to those cycles in the auto industry , and when we tell them they ' re not going back , it ' s like committing political suicide. " //
