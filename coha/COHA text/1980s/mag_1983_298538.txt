One year later , Israel has little to show for its invasion of Lebanon <P> The ceremonies , conducted in a second-class hotel in the Beirut suburb of Khalde and three hours later in a community cultural center in the Israeli border town of Qiryat Shemona , were aptly symbolic . In the Khalde ceremony , Lebanese Negotiator Antoine Fattal held his chin in knit fingers , and his eyes were downcast . He applauded politely but without enthusiasm when his Israeli counterpart , David Kimche , made a brief speech praising the agreement that was about to be signed . Lebanese President Amin Gemayel summed up his countrymen 's attitude when he later declared , " Lebanon is not holding celebrations today . Lebanon 's real feast will come on the day the external forces leave our territory . " <P> That feast day does not seem imminent . In spite of the 24-page agreement laboriously negotiated by Lebanese , Israeli and U.S. diplomats over five months , there was little hope that any of the foreign troops now in Lebanon were actually prepared to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not withdraw its estimated 38,000 troops from Lebanon until the 50,000 Syrian troops and the 10,000 to 15,000 Palestine Liberation Organization commandos had first been removed , and Syrian President Hafez Assad has made it clear that he has no intention of cooperating . <P> The effective failure of the agreement that had just been achieved was a fitting ending , in a way , to the first year of Israel 's war in Lebanon . Israel had removed the threat of P.L.O . bombardment of Israel 's northern cities , but had failed to destroy the organization as a political force in the Arab world . The Soviets , who were humiliated by their client Syria 's poor military performance against Israel last summer , seem to have recouped their position in the area and are proclaiming that peace in the Middle East is impossible without them . Israeli troops , in the meantime , are still bogged down in Lebanon . <P> The week 's formal events went largely as expected . The Lebanese Cabinet and Parliament approved the withdrawal agreement unanimously . The Israeli Knesset also approved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 members of the opposition Labor Party abstaining as a gesture of protest against the way in which the government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin had conducted the war . <P> The agreement calls on Israel to withdraw its forces within eight to twelve weeks after the accord goes into effect . After that , a limited number of Israelis would be allowed to operate in southern Lebanon as members of eight Lebanese-Israeli joint supervisory teams and at liaison centers to be established near Hasbeya and Mayfadun . <P> The agreement further specifies that the security area in southern Lebanon , stretching generally from the Israeli border to a line running east along the Awali River , which enters the Mediterranean Sea just north of Sidon , is to be divided into two zones . The northern sector is to be patrolled by a regular Lebanese army brigade , while the southern is to be patrolled by a territorial brigade made up of soldiers from the immediate area .
