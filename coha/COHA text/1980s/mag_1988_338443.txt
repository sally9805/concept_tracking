On paper , they seem almost interchangeable . Young , attractive products of privileged British households , both are working mothers of small children and second wives to older , distinguished husbands . More important , Editors Tina Brown of Vanity Fair and Anna Wintour of House &; Garden are journalistic prodigies boldly imposing their visions on two venerable American magazines in the same publishing empire . Recruited by Newspaper Scion S.I . Newhouse , proprietor of the eleven Conde Nast magazines , Brown and Wintour are rising stars who may one day equal such Conde Nast legends as Diana Vreeland , formerly of Vogue , and Ruth Whitney of Glamour . <P> Up close , however , the two could not be more different . Willowy , auburn- haired Wintour , 38 , is cool and withdrawn ; Brown , 34 , a shorter , shapely blond , is brassy and outgoing . Their editing styles are as distinct as their looks . Brown is verbal , literary , with a knack for matching writer to subject , while Wintour is a visual creature , renowned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House &; Garden last fall , rumors of a Dynasty-style cat fight with Brown began to circulate .

" <P> That Vanity Fair , one of the most celebrated avant-garde magazines of the 1920s , would once again be a trendsetter was exactly what Newhouse and Conde Nast Editorial Director Alexander Liberman hoped when they revived the long- defunct magazine in 1983 . But after one of the most heralded debuts in recent publishing history , the new magazine collapsed under the weight of its own pretension . Eleven months and two editors later , Newhouse and Liberman hired Brown , an Oxford graduate whose spunky editing had turned around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her light , irreverent British sensibility to the New World . " Americans want real information , substance , something solid , " she observes . The result was what she calls an " intellectual cabaret "  --  a saucy , literate celebrity magazine featuring profiles of Hollywood stars , aristocrats and parvenus , ballasted with some weightier and newsier pieces . Her philosophy of journalism as voyeurism seems to have worked . Since her arrival , circulation has ballooned from 259,753 to 595,844 , and advertising pages have more than tripled.
