Carlo Rubbia was in a Milan cab , en route to Linate Airport last week and worrying about a possible Italian air-traffic controllers ' strike . Suddenly the pop music on the taxi 's radio was interrupted by a news bulletin : Rubbia and Simon van der Meer , his colleague at CERN , the great European nuclear research complex , had been jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics . At first the taxi driver did not believe his passenger 's excited claims to be the man in the news . " But when I convinced him , " Rubbia recalls , " he offered me a free ride . " <P> That the physicist learned of his prize in transit was fitting . Known among his friends as " the Alitalia scientist , " Rubbia , 50 , frequently flies from CERN , located outside Geneva where he does his research , to Harvard University in Cambridge , Mass. , where he teaches physics . His relentless energy and aggressive pursuit of ideas are what led to his discovery of three critical subatomic particles , ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubbia 's find represented a great leap forward in science 's attempt to prove the so-called unified field theory , which would link the four forces of nature in a single elegant set of equations . Two of those forces are familiar : electromagnetism , which lights bulbs and makes clothes cling ; and gravity , which holds humans to the ground and determines the earth 's orbit around the sun . The remaining two are more exotic : the so-called strong force , which binds together the particles in a nucleus ; and the weak force , which controls radioactive decay . <P> Scientists believe that all four forces are manifestations of one fundamental superforce , which split into different forms after the birth of the universe . Some physicists had proposed that electromagnetism and the weak force , for example , might be combined , but their complex theory required the existence of three extremely heavy particles to complete the profile of the weak force : the positive W boson , negative W boson and Z boson . Rubbia decided to chase them down . <P> At CERN 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method of creating supercollisions among subatomic particles that would , he predicted , produce the carriers of the weak force . <P> At first nobody believed his proposal , particularly since it would require the conversion of the synchrotron into a particle collider , at a cost of $55 million . Rubbia 's notions , however , had one staunch supporter : Simon van der Meer , a senior engineer at CERN . Van der Meer designed a device critical to the taming of the colliding beams in Rubbia 's experiment . In 1979 CERN gave Rubbia and Van der Meer a go-ahead for their project , and by 1983 the three particles had been found . <P> The flamboyant Rubbia , born in Gorizia , Italy , is certain to enjoy his half of the approximately $195,000 prize . He owns a yacht and has a hearty appetite , particularly for Italian food . He is impatient with lesser minds than his and is intellectually restless : his current projects range from tracking down the magnetic monopole , another elusive particle , to searching for antimatter.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
