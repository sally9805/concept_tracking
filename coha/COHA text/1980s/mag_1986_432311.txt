 | America 's space program , stunned by revelations that its chain of command was fatally flawed , now faces a rebuilding effort that will postpone military , commercial and scientific projects , perhaps for years . Seldom has a U.S. agency fallen so quickly from shining star to scapegoat . Despite its admirable safety record and a quarter-century of towering achievement , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) is suddenly defending itself against allegations from Congress , from a presidential investigating commission and even from its own contractors . Above all , critics are asking if NASA 's vaunted " can do " spirit may have unwittingly triggered the January 28 Challenger catastrophe that killed seven astronauts and brought manned U.S. space ventures to a halt . " NASA was the outfit that could do no wrong , " said a source close to the shuttle-investigation commission . " Now , it looks as if somebody got overconfident and twisted arms to get that launch off even though the red warning flags were flying . " Although official findings wo n't be announced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain : Shuttle flights , which NASA had hoped to resume by mid-1986 , will be grounded for as long as two years . The reason : Extensive overhauls and retooling of rockets and fuel systems . Congress will insist on improvements in NASA management and internal communications . But lawmakers are still expected to approve the nearly $3 billion it will take to build a replacement orbiter for Challenger . Sending mission specialists into space will remain a priority , although plans will be scaled back to exclude cargo that can be placed in orbit by unoccupied , expendable rockets . If for no other reason , astronaut-piloted U.S. flights will continue because the Soviet Union is intent on pursuing its goal of a human presence in space . Business interest in space development remains high , though fledgling entrepreneurial start-ups in space are on hold . Revenues from commercial space ventures were projected as high as $50 billion by the year 2000 . Moreover , few projects will shift immediately to the European space effort , in part because Europe 's Ariane rocket is booked nearly solid for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shuttle will be transferred to Titan rockets without crews when possible . But once the shuttle missions resume , crucial military cargo may bump commercial items lower on the flight manifest . Until the shuttle is again ready to fly , Air Force Under Secretary Edward Aldridge says , inability to carry military equipment to orbit constitutes " a national emergency . " Although a February 20-25 Los Angeles Times poll shows that 3 out of 4 people support the shuttle program , the agency has come under increasing fire that will surely spur a major revamping of its management procedures . In public hearings , the presidential commission on the shuttle disaster grilled officials involved in launch preparations with questions that seemed prosecutorial in tone . William Rogers , the former Secretary of State who chairs the commission , warned in his opening statement that the accident " may involve human error , as distinguished from equipment failure . " After days of testimony , in which shuttle engineers told how they had argued that Challenger should not be launched in extremely cold weather , Rogers remained unsatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point that we thought the decision-making process may be flawed , " he told four senior NASA officials . " I think I 'm speaking for the whole commission when I say we think it is flawed . " Despite strong denials , there is continuing suspicion that high-level NASA officials were informed of the potential danger before the launch . " The issue was so controversial I thought people were aware " of it , said Allan McDonald , engineering chief at Kennedy Space Center for Morton Thiokol , manufacturer of the solid-rocket-booster motors . " I have a hard time believing they did n't . " Another vigorously denied report : That the White House pressured NASA to get the Challenger up on time so the President could place a call to the crew during his state-of-theunion message . Presidential press spokesman Larry Speakes called the story " the most vicious and distorted rumor I have ever heard . " Whatever the conclusions eventually reached by the commission , the hearings reveal a decision-making process at NASA 's highest levels that showed  | individuals willing to apply enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these deliberations ? " asked commission member Joseph Sutter , a Boeing executive . " Why did n't someone react to these obvious warnings that the launch was in jeopardy ? " The intense scrutiny of NASA 's management came at a time when the agency was at its most vulnerable point in years . Administrator James Beggs , who resigned February 26 , was under criminal indictment for actions unrelated to his work at NASA . Beggs had been a strong proponent of the shuttle program and had long experience in aerospace ventures . Acting Administrator William Graham , who has been on the job less than two months , probably will be replaced soon by a new permanent agency chief . Problems at the top already are filtering down through NASA 's demoralized employe roster . Says a contract engineer at Johnson Space Center : " A lot of old-timers say Challenger was the inevitable result of taking too many shortcuts and getting too many mixed signals about priorities . A lot of us are n't going to wait around for the next disaster . " ORBITAL EXPLOITS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of major projects and is forcing space customers to seek alternatives . Science missions ? including probes of Jupiter and the sun 's atmosphere ? are in doubt for two years . Military intelligence satellites and Star Wars research are being diverted to expendable rockets . Also stymied : A host of commercial ventures , including orbital communications links and space factories . A study of NASA management by the National Academy of Public Administration released last October also predicts a " mass exodus of senior executives in the next several years and a gap in high-potential midlevel replacements . " Pressures on NASA are expected to build as Congress monitors the probe  | into the Challenger tragedy . Senator Ernest Hollings ( D-S.C. ) is among many in Congress who will put NASA managers under the spotlight for months . " What pressure was on NASA to divert from the normal procedure ? " asked Hollings . " Why did NASA demand a launch against the better advice of experts ? " While the finger pointing continues in coming months , venture capitalists insist that there is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reserved space on future shuttles are exploring alternatives . One prospect that has been given new life is Transpace Carriers , Inc. , a Maryland firm that plans to put satellites into space aboard Delta rockets . A company spokesman says the first launch could take place in April , 1987 . Officials at GTE Spacenet , a major satellite-communications network , have booked space on Europe 's Ariane rocket but hope that the U.S. will build a new generation of crewless vehicles . Says Tom Natoli of GTE : " With the human-intervention capabilities of the shuttle , it was almost too sophisticated for launching a **25;850;TOOLONG satellite . Maybe the accident will revitalize the **25;877;TOOLONG program in the U.S. " For others , only the shuttle will do . One of these is McDonnell Douglas , working with a subsidiary of 3M on a project to produce an experimental drug in the weightlessness of space that stimulates production of human redblood cells . " We really require a manned space effort , and the shuttle is the key to our success , " says 3M official Dan Gahlon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , for example , had anticipated an August shuttle launching of the most sophisticated space telescope ever devised . Despite such disappointments , General Space Corporation announced plans on February 26 to build a new shuttle using a combination of private financing and public stock offerings . The orbiter would then be leased to NASA at rates favorable to the government , but profits would be returned to investors . NASA rocket manager Mulloy doubted engineers who warned of dangers from cold For the time being , military users are forging ahead , as well . The Air Force has ordered 10 single-use , expendable rockets that can launch most military reconnaissance and communications satellites . Those wo n't be delivered until 1988 , but the Air Force already has a stockpile of about 15 Titan and Atlas rockets to send urgent payloads into orbit . The Air Force also is accelerating completion of the Vandenberg Launch Facility in California , where most military shuttle flights will originate . Planners now say the site will be able to launch a shuttle by late 1986 ? if the shuttle fleet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenger tragedy continues , Congress still intends to approve NASA 's 1987 budget of $7.7 billion and may add from $1 billion to $3 billion more to begin building another shuttle . Asserts a key Senate Republican : " The sentiment on the Hill is deeply and strongly in NASA 's favor . Many are disturbed because serious errors were made in the shuttle incident , but the space program remains a stirring case of American leadership in science and technology . "
