While the Reagan Administration and Wall Street are lamenting high interest rates , many Americans have come to like them . The small investor who was boasting in the mid- ' 60s about his killing in the stock market or in the late ' 70s about his big earnings from real estate is now telling everyone within earshot about the yield on his money-market fund . Last week he was bragging that the money he took out of a savings bank , where it was earning 5.5% interest , was paying a 17% return . <P> Likewise , corporate treasurers once accused of being too timid to make major long-term spending decisions , such as approving a costly new plant , have become heroes . That factory might have made a healthy profit after a few years , but the jumbo bank certificate of deposit that he bought for $100,000 immediately earns nearly 18% . <P> Companies with large amounts of cash on hand , including Seagram and Bendix , have also been benefiting . High interest rates have depressed the price of certain energy stocks like Conoco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undervalued ones at a fraction of their true worth . <P> Anyone with enough reckless courage to play the financial futures markets could earn high profits . Activity at this market in Chicago has more than doubled in the past two years . Faced with the risk of even higher interest rates , banks and pension funds have been forced to hedge with financial futures , which are contracts to buy Government securities or foreign currencies at some later date . The speculators are betting that interest rates will go higher rather than lower . If the cost of money goes up , they sell their futures contracts for a good earning . For instance , an investor who in June put up a $2,400 deposit on a $100,000 Treasury bond future due in December of this year could have liquidated his position last week and made an impressive profit of about $12,000 . <P> The payoff from those stunning interest rates , though , is often only an inflationary illusion . Over the past two centuries , the real interest rate in the U.S. has been fairly consistent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current level of inflation . A return of 17% from a money-market fund is obviously better than 5.25% from a bank , but if the inflation rate is also 17% , the depositor is not really that far ahead . With inflation now at about 11% , a yield of 17% is clearly a good deal . <P> Today 's high rates would not have been welcomed by anyone a few years ago , when the legal ceiling on interest the average saver could earn was the meager 5.5% paid on a passbook account at a savings and loan association or a mutual savings bank . The level is established by the Government . But financiers have been very creative in developing new high-yield deposits . Starting next month , for example , the new All Savers Certificate that was approved by Congress last summer will pay 12.61% tax-free for up to $1,000 in interest for an individual or $2,000 for a couple .
