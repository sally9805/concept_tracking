America loves to laugh with Joan Rivers . But the joke may be on our queen of comedy , suggests the May issue of Vanity Fair in an unkind dissection of a jester . James Wolcott , an entertaining , often acute critic , finds in Rivers a seeming obsession with ridiculing physical imperfections , which is sadly revealing in its hostility . Her regular fill-ins for Johnny Carson on " The Tonight Show " amount to a " search-and-seizure approach to privacy " in which Rivers , like the National Enquirer , " seems to be mocking stars for being mortal , for not being forever spring-fresh and smooth . " A favorite target has been actress Elizabeth Taylor . Wolcott admits to a few guffaws over Rivers ' antibulge blitzkrieg ( such as a line about Taylor getting stuck between McDonald ' s golden arches ) , but then contends the assaults upon excess weight " took on a creepy life of their own . " Rivers attacked Taylor again and again , " as if hoping to leave blood in the snow . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create in the public mind a cartoon image of Liz as a missile aimed at the dessert cart , a pigout artist . " Serving as unlicensed psychologist , Wolcott spies in Rivers a woman of deep envies and hatreds , mostly directed at herself . Forget about the pricey outfits worn on TV , he says ; she looks like a mess . She has endured such a facial overhaul by plastic surgery that her face is so tight it " couldn ' t relax if you hit it with a mallet . " In the process , Rivers has " made herself a martyr to the mirror " and a symbol of a " masochism of spirit and flesh . " One safely presumes that the art of Henny Youngman or Lucille Ball rarely have been the object of such a critique . Wolcott concludes that the comedian may " end up like one of those poor , rich , anxious , pampered queens on ' Hollywood Wives , ' obsessed with looks , obsessed with status , obsessed with age , afraid to let go . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , and Taylor seems destined to have the last laugh. "  --  Commonweal ( May 17 )  --  The editors of a fine liberal Catholic biweekly offer their view of President Reagan ' s visit to Bitburg : " Of all the lessons of his presidency , the one we must not fail to heed is Ronald Reagan ' s stumbling at Bitburg . " More than any moment , they say , it reveals both his deep " disconjunctions " and " our own hidden human face . " It shows our desire to be " spared of the unpleasant present and past " and to " smooth out memory , " in this instance by making a " morally indefensible equation " of the sufferings of German soldiers with those of the victims of the S.S. They deem Elie Wiesel to have been basically correct , if a bit simplistic , in calling the issue one of good and evil . Still , they urge that we " live wakefully " to keep the " volcanic ash " of antisemitism from exploding.  --  Mother Jones ( June ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade of magazines concocting a best and worst list . This is of socially responsible companies . Chicago ' s South Shore Bank makes the best list , while Oak Brook ' s Waste Management Corp. makes the worst ( " Asking Waste Management to responsibly dispose of another drop of toxic waste is like handing a rapist the keys to a women ' s dormitory " ) . The good-guy group includes Citizens Energy Corp. of Boston , founded by a son of the late Robert Kennedy , and Quad/ Graphics of Pewaukee , Wis . The worst , whose earnings dwarf those of the best , include Citicorp , E.I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . , Manville Corp . , General Electric and Mobil Corp.  --  Los Angeles ( May )  --  Here ' s a story you will not find in the New England Journal of Medicine or the Journal of Southeast Asian Affairs : a guide to L.A. ' s best dry cleaners . Silly as it seems , it is in part a helpful primer on machines and solutions used by the best cleaners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California is the only state that requires both testing and bona fide training before giving out a cleaning license . One also gets a where-are- they-now look at the inspirations for the films " Norma Rae , " " Prince of the City , " " Midnight Express , " " The Right Stuff " and " Heart Like a Wheel . " Most have been shafted financially by Hollywood . Typical is Crystal Lee Sutton , the textile mill worker played by Sally Field in " Norma Rae . " Sutton netted a measly $20 , 000 . In addition , one learns that Eddie Egan , the cop portrayed by Gene Hackman in " The French Connection , " made $30 , 000 from a film that brought the studio $70 million , while Frank Serpico , the cop played by Al Pacino in " Serpico , " is one of the few lucky ones , having netted $400 , 000 .
