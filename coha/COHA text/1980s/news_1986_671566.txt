" But that is not the path that you must take , since you have further possibilities of considering the evidence . " He urged the court to " pass down the path of complete truth , if you wish to. " // Under Italian law , defendants can be declared not only " guilty " or " not guilty , " but also " absolved for lack of proof . " This compromise verdict , Mr. Marini ' s recommendation today , has been described by some Italian jurists as " acquittal , second class . " The leading Bulgarian defendant , Sergei I.

" We want our client declared not guilty , that he did not do the deed . He has been confined for three years without doing anything. " // The prosecution ' s case was built largely on the testimony of Mr. Agca . The 28-year right-wing Turkish terrorist first declared that he had acted alone when he shot the Pope in St. Peter ' s Square on May 13 , 1981 . Later , in testimony that was often confused and contradictory , he said he had acted on orders from the Soviet Union through the Bulgarian secret service. // During the trial , Mr. Agca undermined the prosecution ' s case by his erratic , contradictory and at times seemingly irrational testimony . At various points , he said he was Jesus Christ and predicted the world was about to end. // Mr. Marini said that despite Mr. Agca ' s antics , sufficient evidence emerged for him to seek the conviction of the four Turkish defendants , described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asks Two Life Sentences // Mr. Marini asked the court to impose sentences of life imprisonment on Oral Celik , 26 , who is at large , and Musa Serdar Celebi , 34 , who he said assisted Mr. Agca in planning and executing the attempt on the Pope ' s life. // He asked the court to impose a sentence of 24 years imprisonment and a $775 fine on Omer Bagci , 40 , for helping Mr. Agca smuggle into Italy the pistol used to shoot the Pope , and he sought a one-year sentence and $650 fine for Mr. Agca , for the same crime . Mr. Agca is already serving a sentence of life imprisonment for his attack on the Pope. // Mr. Bagci and Mr. Celebi were the only defendants present at today ' s session. // The conclusion to Mr. Marini ' s marathon summation , which lasted more than 30 hours stretching over 11 days , was a partial admission of defeat by the Italian judiciary , which spent nearly five years trying to build a case against the Bulgarians. // The case attracted worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Soviet Union and its allies sought to kill the Polish-born Pope to quell resistance to Communism in his native land . <> <> Charges From East and West // It stirred bitter accusations in East and West , including countercharges by the Soviet Union that the purported plot had been invented by Western intelligence services to impugn the East bloc and weaken Communist parties in the West. // Mr. Marini ' s ambiguous conclusion was unlikely to quell the debate .

" // He bitterly accused the presiding judge , Severino Santiapichi , of failing to admit additional witnesses and allow the prosecution to pursue new leads in the case .

" ROME , Feb. 27 - When the court trying seven Turks and Bulgarians accused of conspiring to assassinate Pope John Paul II retires next month to weigh the evidence presented by prosecution and defense , it will be following a set of rules widely different from those prevailing in United States criminal courts. // For one thing , unlike similar American panels , which must decide between guilty and not guilty , the court can choose among three possible alternatives : guilty , not guilty and absolved for lack of proof . The last verdict implies that evidence exists supporting both guilt and innocence , and that the court is unable to decide which body of evidence prevails. // Moreover , unlike American courts , where the jury is instructed by the judge and then forms its judgment independently , the Italian decision will be made jointly by the two professional judges and six lay jurors hearing the case. // Each of the panel ' s eight members has an equal vote , and a verdict is decided by a simple majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations of prosecution or defense . Indeed , Giuseppe De Luca , a professor of criminal law at Rome University , says its decision is not even bound by hard evidence , but is based on what Italian jurists describe as " free conviction , " or the personal persuasion of the court ' s members. // Thus , despite the call today by the public prosecutor , Antonio Marini , for acquittal of the three Bulgarians " for lack of evidence , " legal experts say the final decision remains entirely open. //
