Rejected by the provinces , he turns to Parliament for his reforms <P> When the voters of French-speaking Quebec rejected Premier Ren Lvesque 's attempt to lead their province out of Canada in last May 's referendum , the relief was palpable throughout the country . Yet few Canadians were under any delusion that the verdict would mean a return to business as usual . With support of the premiers of the nine other provinces , Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau made what he called " a most solemn commitment " in return for the non to separatism : " We will immediately take action to renew the constitution and will not stop until we have done that . " <P> By last week , however , a summer-long effort by the federal and provincial governments to reach accord on constitutional change had collapsed in acrimonious failure . At the end of a six-day summit around a horseshoe table in Ottawa-capped by a last-ditch private bargaining session in Trudeau 's drawing room-the Prime Minister and the premiers reported that they had been unable to agree on a single point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a trade-off in the reapportionment of powers between the federal and provincial governments . The provinces want to increase their control over economic resources , while retaining control over the all-important matter of language instruction . Trudeau was willing to concede some economic autonomy to them , particularly in the area of mineral rights , in return for their support for a new constitutional " Charter of Rights " that would vest additional powers in the federal government . <P> Even if they had succeeded in striking a bargain , a further step would be required : putting an end to the anomaly by which Canada can not amend its constitution-the British North America Act of 1867-without the approval of Britain 's Parliament . However , by custom even that requires unanimity on the part of the provincial governments , and since the Ottawa conference made plain that this was impossible , the " patriation " of the constitution , as Canadians put it , was out of reach by traditional means . <P> Thus Trudeau last week decided to try to circumvent the balky premiers . He announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premiers refused to do . He plans to ask the legislators for unilateral action to " patriate " the British North America Act without provincial approval . <P> Most of the premiers had rejected Trudeau 's proposed changes on the grounds that some of their considerable powers would be usurped . They argued that under British parliamentary tradition , human rights are more securely protected by legislatures than by the courts . Quebec 's Lvesque , for example , opposed the language-rights formula because he felt it would undermine his provincial government 's control over Quebec 's cultural identity . Indeed , the premiers were anxious to talk about expanding their powers and blamed Trudeau for insisting on a heavily centralized view of Canadian federalism .
