For some , the road to Los Angeles runs through the courts <P> Instead of a stop watch , it takes a law degree to keep up with would-be Olympians these days . Last week in Los Angeles , two federal judges addressed cases brought by athletes who claimed that they were not being allowed to compete in their specialties because of discrimination both sexual and professional . In each case the court declined to second-guess the various athletic regulatory bodies that establish and , ever so slowly , change the rules .

Attorney Susan McGreivy : " The lack of parity is just outrageous . " <P> Federal Judge David Kenyon acknowledged the frustration for a woman athlete " who , had she been a man , could compete in one or both of these events . " But he did not think there was enough evidence that state and federal antidiscrimination laws had been violated . The women plan an immediate appeal , to the consternation of Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee President Peter Ueberroth , who supports the cause but not the tactics .
