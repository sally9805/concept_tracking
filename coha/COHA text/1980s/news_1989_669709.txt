' ' Debt is not the central issue , ' ' says the head of an institution that , with its affiliates , made some $20 billion in development-loan commitments last year . He sees the bank ' s greatest goal as alleviation of poverty : 90 million poor people in Latin America , where debt impedes economic growth ; 280 million ' ' absolute poor ' ' in Africa , where the need is for more schools , roads , and other infrastructure ; and 600 million in Asia where debt is not a serious problem. // Nonetheless , the World Bank and its sister institution , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , are expected to play a key role in the revised United States strategy for dealing with the $1. 2 trillion in developing-country debts owed to the commercial banks and governments of industrial nations. // // That altered strategy , outlined March 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , envisions three ways to reduce the debt burden of debtor nations . In one case , bank loans would be swapped for ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks would take a loss on a portion of these loans . In a second case , bank debts would be traded for similar bonds , but with equal face value and a lower interest rate . The banks would lose on interest payments . Third , debts could be swapped for part ownership of businesses in the debtor nation. // How the bank and IMF will be involved in this process is not entirely clear . Bank officials expect details of the Brady approach to be fleshed out by precedents to be set when the debts of individual countries are rescheduled . The primary candidate for a test of this approach is Mexico with $102 billion in foreign debts. // Mr. Conable spoke just before Secretary Brady last Friday at a meeting of the Bretton Woods Committee , saying : ' ' A good place to start would be with Mexico . Mexico has indicated a willingness to engage in major reform , it has substantial prospects but substantial debt , and it has lived up to its obligations. ' ' // In an interview here , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting the thing evolve some , in trying to include debt-reduction components in the workout schemes that we are trying to put together for these countries. ' ' // Since the US federal government with its huge budget deficit finds itself in no position to accept any transfer of loan losses from the commercial banks , it will expect the World Bank , the IMF , and the Inter-American Development Bank to help in rescheduling deals . These institutions most likely will guarantee some ' ' exit bonds ' ' or a portion of new commercial bank loans that such debtor nations as Mexico need to assure future economic growth. // These multilateral institutions will also be expected to inject money into the debtor countries with what are called ' ' adjustment loans . ' ' These are not tied to any development project , such as a dam , but are used to help cover international-payments deficits in return for domestic economic reforms in the debtor countries. // However , Conable warns that any such measures must not bankrupt either the commercial banks or the multilateral institutions , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // The former US congressman undoubtedly had in mind the safety of the bank ' s capital , which a needed majority of the bank ' s 151 member nations agreed to nearly double last year. // Some commercial bankers have hoped that with the capital increase the World Bank could rapidly increase its lending . This would help the debtor nations grow faster and ease their debt-servicing burden. // However , Conable questioned whether the bank itself ( minus such affiliates as the International Development Association , which makes easy-term loans to the poorest countries , and the International Finance Corporation , which makes equity investments in private companies in developing countries ) could grow 10 percent a year as originally thought . That growth rate would increase its annual loan commitments from $15 billion now to $20 billion in the early 1990s. // Conable ' s caution stems from the bank ' s greater emphasis on protecting the environment , helping women progress , and stimulating the private sector in making new development loans. // Protecting the environment is necessary to sustain the resource base and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring women , half the human race. // These greater emphases require more work on the part of the staff of the World Bank , as well as more coordination with the developing countries , the bank president notes. // He also says the bank ' s ' ' member countries , ' ' presumably in this case some industrial nations , do not want the development institution ' ' to go all out and grow the way we used to. ' ' // Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. charges the bank with a ' ' timid approach ' ' to its nonproject-related lending , that it does not provide adequate support to developing countries undertaking economic reforms . It points out that these countries are making more interest and capital payments to the World Bank than they are receiving from the bank . Thus in the first nine months of 1988 there was a net inflow to the bank of $1. 63 billion. // This , explains Conable , is partly because nations that have progressed enough in economic terms to ' ' graduate ' ' from receiving bank loans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not graduated ) is using it huge international payments surplus to repay old loans. // Further , a country like India with a ' ' big bureaucracy ' ' is slow in actually disbursing the loan money that has been approved by the bank for various projects . India has committed but undisbursed bank loans exceeding $10 billion , he says. // Another factor in slow disbursement has been the failure of some key debtor nations to live up to their promises of economic reforms. // Conable noted that Brazil has not met its ' ' conditionality requirements , ' ' and thus the bank has held back some loan funds. // The same is true of Argentina . The World Bank agreed last October to make loans of $1. 25 billion to Argentina . It was controversial because , with the approval of the United States and some other industrial countries , the bank sidestepped the IMF , which normally takes the lead in providing major loans of this type. // Early this month the bank suspended further loan disbursements when Argentina failed to meet specific loan conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conable has doubts that Argentina will make the necessary reforms soon. // Such required reforms , he emphasizes , are intended to bring about conditions for economic growth , not to cause shrinkage. // The Argentine loan was one sign of a certain rivalry between the bank and the IMF . ' ' There are various stresses and strains between the two agencies , ' ' admits Conable . ' ' But I wouldn ' t overstate it. ' ' // This stems from some overlap in their jurisdiction , he explains . The IMF provides short-term stabilization loans to countries with balance of payments problems . The bank makes longer-term development loans . However , both institutions have moved into the area of medium-term loans to developing countries. // ' ' We can manage the overlap by major consultation , cooperation , and coordination of our activities , ' ' he says. // //
