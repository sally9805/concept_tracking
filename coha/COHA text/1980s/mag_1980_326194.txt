In Georgia and California , faculties tangle with the Feds <P> Campus cries of interference from Washington and the courts are all too familiar . But last week the level of lamentation rose to a new crescendo in the wake of two incidents . First there was the jailing , for contempt of court , of University of Georgia Education Professor James A. Dinnan , 50 ; second there was Washington 's announcement that the University of California at Berkeley risked becoming the nation 's first university to lose federal contracts in a dispute over affirmative action . Under attack in Georgia , as well as California , was one of the academic world 's most sacred traditions , the deep confidentiality that shrouds " peer review , " the free-spirited appraisal of faculty members up for tenure . <P> Georgia 's Dinnan was one of nine faculty members who voted , 6 to 3 , to deny tenure to Psycholinguist Maija Blaubergs , 33 , a teacher in the college of education since 1972 . It was the third time in as many years that Blaubergs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Georgia , charging sexual discrimination . During pretrial interrogation , Dinnan refused to disclose how he had voted . Instead he asked : " If academic freedom is not the right to judge one 's peers free from outside pressure or intimidation , then what is it ? " <P> As Federal District Court Judge Wilbur Owens Jr . saw the matter , Dinnan was withholding evidence from the court , since under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 it can become the courts ' responsibility to decide whether junior faculty members like Blaubergs have been given fair consideration . Said Owens : " This court ca n't determine whether or not you did that unless you explain to the court what you individually did and why you did it . " To pressure Dinnan to testify , Owens fined him $100 a day for 30 days , and then sentenced him to 90 days in jail . Faculty colleagues raised most of the $3,000 to pay the fine . To sharpen the issue , Dinnan wore his full academic robes when surrendering to begin his prison term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
