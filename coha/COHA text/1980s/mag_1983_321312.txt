COVER STORY <P> Big Blue uses salesmanship and innovation to bestride the computer world <P> IBM . Three of the most famous letters in American business . For years the International Business Machines Corp . towered over the office-equipment industry . Then in the 1970s , besieged by Government antitrust charges and challenged by ambitious new rivals , the giant seemed to be staggering , and those three famous letters lost a bit of their luster . Was IBM 's dominance in jeopardy ? <P> Not a chance . Under the direction of John Opel , 58 , who became chief executive officer in January 1981 , the firm has been acting like its brashest competitors-entering new markets , chasing the latest technology , trimming organizational fat and selling more aggressively than ever . In 1982 , IBM had profits of $4.4 billion on sales of $34.4 billion , making it the most profitable U.S. industrial company . Says Stephen McClellan , author of an upcoming book on the computer industry : " In the 1970s , IBM was a battleship in mothballs . Today it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's lean new stance more evident than in the way it plunged into the personal-computer market in August 1981 . Tackling the mass market for computers for the first time , the company broke many of the traditions that had made it so successful in the past .

IBM has already captured 21% of the $7.5 billion U.S. market for personal computers , a staggering feat in so short a time , and is virtually tied with pacesetter Apple Computer , which had a four-year head start . <P> Big Blue , as IBM is nicknamed for the corporate color it puts on many products , is a mighty competitor in a range of products from electric typewriters that sell for $800 to data-processing systems that can cost more than $100 million . It commands some 40% of the worldwide market for computing equipment and produces some two-thirds of all mainframe computers , which are big and medium-size business machines . So great is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different race . Digital Equipment , the No. 2 computermaker , has less than one-fifth of IBM 's sales . Says John Imlay Jr. , chairman of MSA , an Atlanta-based software company : " IBM is simply the best-run corporation in American history . " <P> At a time when American business sometimes seems to be slipping , IBM 's triumphs have served as a reminder that U.S. industrial prowess and know-how can still be formidable . Struggling U.S. steel and automakers have been severely hurt by Japanese and European imports , but Big Blue 's competitiveness is unquestioned . The company is the leading computer firm in virtually every one of the some 130 countries where it does business . " IBM is like your papa , " says a Swiss computer-marketing specialist , " because it 's so big and it 's always there . " Even in Japan , which has six major domestic computermakers and restricts access to its markets , IBM is easily the dominant producer of large computers and is fighting Fujitsu for the overall title . Last year IBM sold $1.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . <P> For all of its success , IBM has been rethinking some of the ways it does business . In a dramatic departure
