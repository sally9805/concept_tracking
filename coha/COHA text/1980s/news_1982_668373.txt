No one who cast an All-Star vote for Bucky Dent should feel embarrassed - not after Billy Martin ' s pitching selections . Martin , a substitute selection himself ( for the Yankees ' Bob Lemon ) , was allowed to bypass Milwaukee ' s Pete Vuckovich and Seattle ' s Bill Caudillbecause he doesn ' t like them . " No wonder the American League hasn ' t won since Lee MacPhail ' s been president , " mused Vuckovich , the winningest pitcher ( 24-8 ) in the league in 1981- 82 . Vuckovich reportedly hollered at Billy from the mound , and Martin has held a grudge against Caudill since April , when Seattle ' s colorful Inspector made some remarks that got At the time of the selections , Caudill ( compared to the five relievers selected ) was first in percentage of games saved ( 17 opportunities , 16 saves ) , first in preventing runners from scoring ( 77 percent ) , second in strikeouts per inning ( 1.14 to Mark Clear ' s 1.15 ) , first in fewest hits per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second in ERA ( 2.03 to Clear ' s 1.93 ) and first in wins ( 7-3 ) . " The first two relievers who deserve to make it , " says Rich Gossage , " are Dan Quisenberry and Caudill . " Not that there weren ' t flaps in the National League . When Atlanta ' s Phil Niekro was told he ' d made the team , he didn ' t believe it . Braves management was so upset because Gene Garber didn ' t make it that they put out a release entitled " The Slighting of Gene Garber . " Of course , they ' d tried to trade Garber to Baltimore for Jimmy Dwyer at the winter meetings . San Diego ' s Tim Lollar was bypassed despite a 9-2 , 2.74 record and the second-best hits-per-nine-innings ratio of any starter . Joaquin Andujar , who gets a $50,000 bonus if he makes the team , wasn ' t selected despite allowing two or fewer earned runs in 15 of his 20 starts . And Niekro , Greg Minton and Tom Hume inexplicably made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo Diaz . " I realize there are injustices every year , " says Pete Rose , " but if the season were to end today , Diaz would be the MVP of the league . " Other slights : Bob Boone , Kent Tekulve , Gorman Thomas , Larry Herndon , Damaso Garcia , Bob Stanley.Opposing managers no longer fear using lefthanded pitchers in Fenway . The Red Sox have hit only nine homers off lefthanders all season , and lefties had started against them in 27 of the 83 games going into yesterday - including 10 in Fenway . In those 27 games , the Sox were 12-3 in the first 15 , 3-9 since June 7 . . . The latest rumor in Cincinnati is that vice president Dick Wagner - not manager John McNamara - is on thin ice . . . The Royals are wary of the merger of Bobby Brett ( with whom general manager John Schuerholz has had unpleasant dealings when Bobby has represented brother George ) and football agent Mike Trope , fearing that they want to become the next hard-line , big- name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Larry Parrish on waivers . At the time , the Athletics were in Texas . That Sunday , Martin asked Don Zimmer , " If we claim him , can we have him ? " Zimmer didn ' t give him a definite answer . But even after the Athletics , Blue Jays and Mariners had expressed interest - the guy was hitting .160 with 8 RBIs - the Rangers had decided to let him go for the waiver price . After the game , Martin told Zimmer , " Well , we claimed him . " But when the waiver period had passed that Wednesday , there was no claim ( apparently , Oakland had fouled it up ) . The following weekend in Oakland , Parrish hit a grand slam and three-run homer in one game and went on a six-game binge of four homers ( including two grand slams ) and 14 RBIs in 17 at-bats . " We were really worried about his eyes , " said one GM who had been interested . . . Before arriving in Texas , Martin had slapped pitcher Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a stumbling , roundhouse right that glanced off the pitcher ' s chin . A few days later , on Fowler ' s 60th birthday , Kingman presented him with a birthday card that had " You Floor Me " on the outside , with a written message : " To the toughest pitching coach in baseball . " Oakland sounds more and more like Paradise Lost . . . Zimmer on the league ' s best-throwing catcher : " There isn ' t any question - Mike Heath ( Oakland ) . " . . . One of Quisenberry ' s tricks is to position the resin bag atop the mound so that submarine ball appears to come right out of the white bag . The Red Sox had the umpires move it several times last Monday night . More rumblings : Frank Robinson is not going to win his tug-of- war with GM Tom Haller in San Francisco . The Giants ' good play the last three weeks keeps him in the job .

Pawtucket ' s Joe Morgan on the International League ' s best prospect : " Easy , Tony Fernandez , " the 19-year-old Syracuse ( Blue Jays ) shortstop . Two of Morgan ' s hottest players have been center fielder Lee Graham , who is above .300 , within six of his club stolen base record of 33 and playing well defensively ; and outfielder Gene Gentile , who has closed in on .300 . Gentile was one of the two players Boston got from Pittsburgh for hiding Mike Easler . . . Meanwhile , in Elmira , manager Dick Beradino says first baseman and top draft pick Sam Horn " hits balls the way Jim Rice did when he came here 11 years ago . " Beradino has by far the youngest team in the league . They ' ve averaged more than eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 17 errors in four games last week ) . . . Kenny Williams , an outfielder-running back from San Jose , got $160,000from the White Sox to play baseball in the summer and football for Stanford in the fall . So when Williams and John Elway are in the Stanford backfield this fall , they will represent better than $300,000 worth of baseball bonuses . . . Getting onto the bus with two boxes of cowboy boots Thursday , Luis Aponte cracked , " I ' m going to be the first Venezuelan cowboy . " . . . Now that the Sox have Horn and Jeff Ledbetter to show for Fred Lynn , they can stop regretting that Lynn canceled the Dodger deal for Mike Marshall and Steve Howe . However , Marshall is 11 for 29 with three titanic homers since coming up to stay , and Howe , who has allowed four homers in 136 major league appearances , has given up three runs in 27 appearances since April . . . The operation on Houston reliever Joe Sambito last week sounds like a Tommy John job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow . Life hasn ' t been kind to the top eight in last year ' s AL Rookie of the Year balloting . Four ( Dave Righetti , Dave Engle , Shooty Babitt , Jorge Bell ) have been sent back to the minors at one time or another , Mike Jones hasn ' t pitched because of his auto accident , and Bobby Ojeda and Mike Witt are out of the rotations on their staffs . The only one who has performed to expectations is Rich Gedman . But sophomore jinx me no sophomore jinx . That ' s mythology . Of the 142 current nonpitchers who played an average of 100 or more games their first three seasons , only 39 had their poorest average in their second year - 61 were lowest as rookies and 42 in their third year . . . As for Ojeda , who has been hampered by injuries and confusion , the Sox may decide he needs to go to Pawtucket and get three , four or five starts . True , there ' s no one down there having a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d like to see Danny Parks get a chance as a long man - he might surprise people with his sinker .

" . . . For those comparing Kirk Gibson ( .278 , 9 HRs , 35 RBIs , .425 slugging percentage ) to Mickey Mantle , the year Mantle turned 25 ( Gibson ' s age ) , he won the Triple Crown at .353 , 52 , 130 , with 132 runs scored , 112 walks and a .705 slugging percentage . He was the last player to slug .700.
