For Bhopal and Union Carbide , the tragedy continues <P> The Union Carbide pesticide plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal looked as if it were being prepared for a war . All day long , giant Indian Air Force MI-8 helicopters swooped down into the area , while special Indian Army units trained in chemical warfare were airlifted to the local airport and positioned within the 72-acre compound . Around the city , more than 2,000 paramilitary troops and armed police officers were moved in to lend emergency assistance . Meanwhile , thousands of civilians were fleeing the city . <P> A week after 45 tons of methyl isocyanate leaked out of the plant , leaving more than 2,500 people dead in the worst industrial disaster ever , the facility was preparing to resume operations temporarily . About 15 tons of the deadly chemical still remained in storage tank No. 619 . If it were allowed to stay there indefinitely , it could turn into gas and start leaking again . After much deliberation , a team of top Indian and American scientists decided that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , just long enough to process the excess methyl isocyanate into pesticide . As thin trails of black smoke once again began to curl out of the plant 's smokestacks , 30 workers walked past the paramilitary forces guarding the main gate and reported back to work . <P> While Bhopal was full of frantic activity , an air of funereal quiet hung over Union Carbide 's sprawling headquarters in Danbury , Conn . Flags were flying at half-mast ; Christmas parties had been canceled . " Nobody is feeling very festive around here , " said a company official . Indeed , the survivors of the tragedy and those being accused of responsibility for it were distinctly hard pressed last week . Both groups remained haunted by the prospect of delayed repercussions : the 200,000 residents of Bhopal who had inhaled the gas faced lingering fears and possible long-term medical effects , while Union Carbide had to face the complex financial and legal fallout from the disaster . Even as the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation set into motion its official inquiry , U.S. lawyers descended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Carbide ( see box ) . <P> As the countdown to the factory 's reopening continued , state officials took drastic precautions to prevent a recurrence of the fatal leak . Throughout the detoxification process , which was to be undertaken only during daylight hours , a helicopter was to circle 200 ft. above the plant . At even the slightest sign of a gas escape , the pilot , protected by a special oxygen mask , would release up to 317 gal . of water to degrade the lethal chemical . If more water were needed , two more helicopters would come to the rescue . All around the facility , blinking lights were set up to help guide the pilots , and the army was to be kept on alert . To dramatize his confidence in the safety of the operation , Arjun Singh , chief minister of Madhya Pradesh , vowed to remain inside the plant for the duration of the process , and to post his senior advisers just outside .                @ @ @ @ @
