And then there was the day , not long after the Bostonian Hotel opened and its carpeted floors still shimmered , when a guest popped his head out of Room 621 and said to a passing Francisco Cano : " Excuse me , I ' ve spilled a little wine in here , can you take care of it ? " Cano , a houseman whose job falls somewhere between a maid and a butler , said : " No problem . I ran downstairs and got my little bottle of spray and a towel and I came back to his room and I said uh-oh ' cause all over the middle of the carpet was a very , very big red stain . He spilled the whole bottle . I said I ' ll be right back , I need a machine . ' " Which is somewhat similar to the day when Angela Huckleberry , formerly a maid and now the assistant housekeeper , rapped smartly on the door of a supposedly vacated room , waited the appropriate time , let herself in and walked smack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she turned several shades of magenta , and he said : " Yes ? " There is an interior life to a hotel that is deliberately hidden from the guests . If you are paying $100 a day or more , you do not want to see the person who picks up the wet towels , or changes the light bulbs , or chops the scallions , or fixes the heat that went blooey 20 minutes before you checked in . Every hotel has its brigade of ancillary staff . The Bostonian , a hotel across from Quincy Market , has 1.3 workers for each of its 155 rooms . The Bostonian , like the four other new hotels that have added a cosmoplitan flavor to an already elegant city , is hardly unique in its manicured treatment of its guests . Mark Bavin , whose khaki pants pockets have descended into terminal droopfrom carrying wrenches , ratchets , pliers and pullers , is one of four fulltime hotel engineers . In the course of his day he is expected to perform all the fix-it chores most of us put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wiring . I can fix the heat . I do some plumbing . I fix small appliances . I can work on big appliances . I make keys . I repair holes in the wall . I replace glass . I repair furniture . I do upholstering . I replace light bulbs . " Bavin paused during the recitation . He backed his head out from under a bathroom sink where he was fiddling with a night light . " I replace a lot of light bulbs . " He was down in the subbasement cutting new keys when the beeper paged him to the service bar at the Seasons Restaurant on the fourth floor . " Ah , engineering , " said the bartender when Bavin appeared . " The espresso machine is on the fritz . " " What ' s wrong with it ? " Bavin asked . " It doesn ' t work , " the bartender diagnosed . The difference between a hotel and most any other business , said Richard Palmer , the hotel ' s general manager who was born with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that every need is an immediate need . When people want breakfast , they want it now . That ' s what they ' re paying for and that ' s what we have to do , fix it now or get a new one now . It ' s why we need so many people . " Palmer had been in hotel management all of one week - at a hotel just outside London ' s Heathrow Airport - when he found that the trade was far more than greeting Bette Davis at the door . On that day , the airport fogged in and 14 fully-loaded 747s already on the runway had to disgorge their disgruntled passengers into whatever hotel had a room or broom closet available . " Half our rooms were dirty , the kitchen was half-stocked because it was Sunday and suddenly we have 350 rather upset fliers lined up in our lobby . The only thing that saved us , we had this Scottish gentleman , a regular guest , and I asked him , begged , actually , to go up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really . ' " A few years later - and just six months after he opened the Bostonian - Palmer was admiring how smoothly things were going in his new hotel when thelights went out . " That was the blackout last spring ( March 2-3* . It affected us rather badly . We ' re an all-electric hotel . " As in no lights , no elevators , no heat and some interesting cold dishes in the restaurant . " We rented a 900 kilowatt generator and we were able to get heat into the rooms and get the kitchen operating . And we bought $2000 worth of battery- powered lanterns so the guests could have light . " And what happened to the lanterns ? Palmer grinned , recognition of another unfailing truism of hotels . " Souvenirs , " he said .
