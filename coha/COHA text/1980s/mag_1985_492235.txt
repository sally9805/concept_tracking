fueling . Burt Rutan has designed the aircraft , a slender , spidery giant named Voyager . It has the wingspan of a Boeing 727 but weighs about the same as a Pitt Special  --  that tiny , red stunt plane that does loops at air shows . Voyager is being given final tests right now . Dick and Jeana are trained for the flight and ready to go . The great day will probably come in the spring of 1986 . Perhaps it would be better to say " great days . " Voyager 's projected flight hangs on her amazingly meager fuel consumption . She 'll take off sloshing with gasoline that her two little engines barely nibble at . Very sedately , at about 100 miles an hour , she 'll meander along a course that will make best use of weather ; she 'll avoid it when it 's unfavorable and ride the winds when they help out . She 'll fly at 15,000 feet , or 25,000 feet , or down on the deck , whichever suits . It 'll take her close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , to get back to where she started . If Voyager makes it , if Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager can stay caged inside for 12 days without atrophying or going nuts , they will be lionized , which will embarrass them . More significantly , they will have proved the effectiveness of an aeronautical facelift that could change the path of aviation . Burt Rutan 's designs feature the canard  --  a small wing in front of the main wing . His aircraft do n't have tail planes . His rudders are often mounted on the main wing . His single engines are pushers ; if two are used they are in line , one pushing , one pulling . Rutan planes are generally built of modern plastics that render them fast , light and efficient . Canards have been around since the beginning of flight : the Wright Flyer , hanging at the Smithsonian , has one . But the Wright brothers used the canard as an elevator control , and it gave them plenty of trouble because it tended to overcontrol . The Rutan canard is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " angle of incidence , " than the main wing . This means that when you try to stall a Rutan plane , cut power and climb steeply , the canard stalls first . It drops , the plane picks up speed again and the main wing does n't stall at all . It sounds simple , but the canard must be designed right and must maintain the smoothness of its airflow . Rutan 's plastic construction helps . A small Rutan plane is a delight to fly  --  wonderfully responsive and obedient . You have a wrist control , a little grip in your right hand , and the slightest pressures on it produce coordinated turns , climbs or a barrel roll if you want . And you move fast ! Those efficient lines and that slick surface spell both speed and range , even with only a modest little Lycoming engine humming away behind you . Such a design springs from a Jong line of Burt Rutan 's innovative ideas . Since the Rutan brothers were boys , near Fresno , California , they were airplane nuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly them . So Burt began making his own  --  and they were much better . He designed his first full-size plane while at California Polytechnic State University and tested its model by mounting it on his car and driving fast along desert roads at night . The full-size version , called VariViggen , caught on , and Burt set up his Rutan Aircraft Factory ( RAF ) to make kits . New designs  --  VariEze , Long-Eze , Defiant ? followed , and also recognition at NASA , where he takes on researchments . Burt 's an amusing and attractive man , except that his workaholism gets in the way of social con , wets . You do n't get to know him very well , but if you listen you can learn a fair bit about aircraft design . Both Rutans learned to fly in their teens , but Dick made a career of it . As an air-force pilot , he flew 325 combat missions in Vietnam , was shot down and rescued . Dick is naturally short-spoken , and long experience raising money for the Voyager project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane seems to exalt him , During or after a flight he proves to be an affable , cordial companion . Dick always seems on the verge of going somewhere  --  off to Oshkosh , Wisconsin , for the annual Experimental Aircraft Association bash ; off to a hangar to check something ; off to downtown Mojave for a quick lunch at a chili parlor ; off to fly around the world without landing or refueling ; or off to make a million dollars . The last two may go together , but the brothers ( though they would both deny this vehemently ) share a sort of instinctive avoidance of quick bucks . Burt hates patents . " All they do is make lawyers richer , " he says . Dick , trying to finance Voyager , turns down those big-money men who offer to pay all the bills if they get to own the plane , to run the show , or both . " The show is ours , " Dick says , " And so 's Voyager . We 'll probably give her to the Smithsonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers not to Burt , who aside from being Voyager 's designer has little to do with the project , but to Jeana Yeager . Tiny and friendly , she seems to look at the world with secret amusement . At first glance she appears fragile . Yet she has trained horses and skydived  --  and broken speed records in Rutan planes . The fourth character in the Voyager drama is the slender , pliant , strangely beautiful creation that , if all goes well , will get around the world on a single wingful of gasoline . Voyager is the ultimate product of the Burt Rutan concept of flight as it should be . The 111-foot wing has the smooth , skinny look , " high aspect ratio , " pilots call it , of a sailplane . Little " winglets " sprout vertically from the wingtips . Two booms cross the wing . The canard runs between them , and viewers of the plane all point out that one boom protrudes past the leading edge of the canard . It 's not a mistake : that 's where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booms hold the twin rudders . Between the booms is a nacelle that houses the two engines and , between them , the tiny cabin . The engines have finally been selected and at the time of writing are being tested . " We run them , " Dick says , " take them apart , check them , put them back together and run them again . " The " tractor " ? the forward engine that pulls the plane  --  is air-cooled . A liquid-cooled engine mounted aft does the pushing . Dick and Jeana plan to use both for the takeoff and for about the first third of the flight . By then half the fuel will be gone , and the plane will have lightened enough that the pusher alone can do the job . The plane is made of space-age materials . Incredibly light , plastic-reinforced fiber encloses a sandwich filler of honeycombed paper . Steel itself is not as strong , and five times heavier . At Mojave , a piece of hull has been set aside just for the doubting press to heft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not even expensive to lay up . A machine does it . " That , " Burt says , " demonstrates how the aircraft industry could produce better , more affordable private planes . " Voyager 's propellers have electrically controlled pitch that can turn the two blades from full feather to reverse . The West German-made propellers were designed for use as auxiliaries on sailplanes and weigh a third as much as similar American props . The cockpit is cramped and simple  --  few instruments , compared to what cockpit-peerers on airlines have come to expect . To the left of the pilot 's seat is a ledge that leads back to give the off-duty pilot a place to rest . it 's skimpy for Dick , aut just fine for Jeana . She points easy to get into  --  or out of . " If we have to bail out , " she says , " the off-duty pilot probably wo n't make it . " Ditching might be more practical if Voyager is stricken . She 'll be over water most of the time , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly built that ditching might well wrench her apart . Both pilots , however , have taken courses in sea survival . They 've also taken oxygen-requirement tests and have set up a new oxygen system that separates nitrogen out of the air and leaves pure oxygen for them to breathe on demand . This will enable them to climb over storms if necessary . Dick , who once flew 331/2 hours  --  about the same duration as Lindbergh 's flight to Paris  --  has strong ideas about the food they should take . " If it tastes good , " he says , " it will probably make you sick . Bland is the answer . " Dehydrated food is out because it absorbs too much body moisture . The amount of food must be carefully regulated . " We 'd like , " Dick says , " to run out of fuel and food at the same time . " NASA doctors , interested in how the flight may affect the two pilots , have asked them to keep personal logs of their physical condition and to note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month before the flight Dick and Jeana plan to work themselves into the biorhythm of their ordeal  --  becoming alert for six hours , then relaxed for six hours . Under way , they 'll keep their watches on California time . Voyager 's long-distance flight tests leave little doubt about her capability . Her canard has been fine-tuned for bad weather  --  the ship was tending to waffle in heavy rain . Dick went to Ohio State University to use a slow-speed wind tunnel there , and modified vortex generators straightened out the problem . Although the huge plane looks stable flying in the still air of early morning , it actually is so pliant that it twitches , writhes and flaps constantly in the choppy air . The wings flap as much as nine feet . Dick says the plane is slow and heavy on the controls , and Jeana says that when you 're cooped up in the bunk you 're apt to feel queasy . " You feel as though you 're on the back of an eagle , " she says . It will be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheduling of the world flight . One big sponsor would , right now , make the difference . By the time this is read , one may emerge . Then the flight might be moved ahead . At this point it looks like next spring or summer .

" Alexander Graham Bell , " said Emily-Sue Hicks , lips moist with chocolate milk , " He invented everything . " A decade ago , the San Francisco superintendent of schools reversed a ban on the classic cookie instigated by his food director . " Graham crackers and milk , " he said , " are one of the fondest memories of my chi/ d hood . " But did he know about the Rev. Sylvester Graham ? Ha ! Sylvester Graham , a fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-fiber , natural-food diet would remedy cholera , alcoholism , premature aging , violence , sexual abuses and digestive ills . Graham believed he had a divine mission to save the souls and the stomachs of the dietary heathen . He dreamed of the day when " all America would eat like Christians instead of boa constrictors . " The gospel according to Graham was classically simple : ? Eat your daily bread from fresh grains and drink pure water . ? Eat fresh , ripe fruits and vegetables , grains and seeds . ? Enjoy pure milk , fresh cheeses and eggs in moderation . ? Avoid fat , salt , sugar , meat , alcontinued on following page cohol , tobacco and stimulants . ? Enjoy fresh air , frequent bathing and exercise . ? Get seven hours sleep . ? Keep a serene spirit . Sounds pretty innocent , right ? But the Graham System stirred enormous controversy . Thousands of rapt devotees attended numbing lectures with such titles as " The Science of Human Life " and " Lecture on Epidemic Diseases Generally and Particularly the Spasmodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " star that shines into the Egyptian darkness of medical ignorance " ? but others sneered at him as " Father Fiber " or " a nut among the crackers . " Emerson christened him " the prophet of bran bread and pumpkins , " but angry butchers and bakers , armed with tar pots and feathers , staged riots whenever he spoke . One newspaper even accused the earnest orator of illustrating his talks with lewd pictures and live , naked women ! A physician declared he would as soon see his female kin emerge from a brothel " as from the secret lectures of this infamous man . " There were , of course , no nude models , and Dr. Graham 's dirty pictures were about as erotic as stomach diagrams for Pepto-Bismol . Graham was simply convinced that everybody should have a basic knowledge of human physiology  --  a startling concept for his day . Graham was humiliated by the suggestion that he be investigated by a grand jury and shocked that the mayor of Boston refused to give him proper protection . Never one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , who was mocked , slandered and beaten for his courage . Even considering Victorian prudery , why all the fuss over some health lectures ? To understand the Reverend Graham 's impact on his era and on our own , we must first examine the man and then the explosive society into which he was thrust . The 17th child of an aging minister , Graham was born in West Suffield , Connecticut , in 1794 . He lost both his father and a brother before he was two years old . His mother collapsed from the strain of caring for six dependents and was sent to an asylum . The emotional scars Graham suffered from being motherless , poor and unwanted certainly lasted all his life . Shuffled from hand to hand , he was billeted with a tavern keeper at age five . The experience made him hate liquor and the behavior it triggered . The lad grew so ill he was packed off to relatives . Most health reformers have a history of wretched health . Graham was no exception . Only his will sustained him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a born organizer and loved to plan balls and parties , sans liquor . Never a racist , he danced with free black girls and gave lectures to those of color . He was not only poor , he was different . On a trumped-up charge , he was expelled from college . He was thwarted in marrying the girl he adored . His dreams of following a professional career like his Scottish grandfather , who was both minister and physician , seemed fanciful . But as Tocqueville wrote in Graham 's heyday , " Every American is eaten up with longing to rise . " Graham battled his weak body to rise like new bread , for the leaven of his longing to be famous was irrepressible . With the help of his wife 's small dowry  --  she had nursed him through illness  --  he became a minister at 32 . His natural talents swiftly propelled continued on following page him into the limelight . He spoke against demon rum and whiskey , then the horrors of masturbation , and last , how to arm against Asiatic cholera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dramatically increased literacy , improved income and better transportation made reform movements inevitable . Says Edith Cole : " Each worthy cause boasted a reform society . . . to promote temperance , to improve asylums , to free or colonize Negroes .. to help fallen women , to eliminate corsets , to change diet and improve health . . . . " It was also a time of sickness . We hear so much about the hardy pioneers that we forget how sick they were . In 1822 Indianapolis had 1,000 people , 900 of whom had bouts of malaria . Not only did people suffer degenerative disease , but filth , bad water and overcrowding made infectious diseases flourish . The British visitor Frances Trollope was horrified to find garbage in the streets and moist pig snouts brushing against her skirts . ( Later she realized that without such porcine " Herculean service , " the town would have been uninhabitable . ) American immigrants sweated in dank and dangerous workshops , and their living quarters were also foul . Dr. Graham complained that young women were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He correctly observed that although incomes were soaring , nutritional standards had plunged . The dietary world of Sylvester Graham 's time was one of galloping consumption and chronic indigestion . Meat was devoured at all three daily meals , the average consumption being 178 pounds a year in the 1830s . " Amazing Maize " supplied whiskey , food for hogs and poultry and the familiar corn pone and grits , soaked in grease gravy and corn syrup . Foreign observers watched in amazement as Americans , arms working like fiddlers , dispatched mountains of hog meat , pastries , fried potatoes , cheeses , pickles , jams , cakes and hot breads without conversation or pause . Meals were washed down with raw whiskey  --  the only thing " that would cut the layers of grease . " Dr. Daniel Drake reported to his colleagues that he knew of " several cases in which fat men had so stuffed themselves with grease and alcohol that they exploded when sparks from a fire fell on them . " Graham 's own wife insisted on gin and wine to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rich food , slipped meat to the children and ridiculed his theories . Overeating and its ravages were called dyspepsia or " dyspepsy , " charmingly defined by the dictionary as " deranged digestion . " Dyspepsy was actually a blanket term for foul breath , furry tongue , bilious headaches , bloated belly , chronic constipation and windy habits . It was no accident that the first American patent medicine , in 1796 , was for Samuel Lee 's Bilious Pills . They sold briskly . Graham 's program held great appeal for many . Orthodox medicine was crude , violent and often dangerous . Bleeding was considered so beneficial that patients were commonly bled into unconsciousness . When they were n't being bled , they were being purged . Cathartics like mercury-rich calomel eroded jaws and loosened teeth . Such heroic medicine was counterbalanced by native healers , who used sweat baths , emetics , herbs and devices like Anti-Consumptive Cork Soles and Medicated Fur Chest Protectors . Mysterious cures emerged from such exotic sources as scrolls found under mummies or on Babylonian clay tablets . Graham 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mirrors current medical thinking with striking accuracy . After all , is n't a low-fat , high-fiber diet the darling of the Pritikin world ? Have n't the heart , cancer and diabetes folks been telling us to eat less cholesterol and more natural foods ? Graham traced his simple program to a romantic , Edenlike world in which man ate a completely natural diet of nuts , seeds , fruits and berries . Straying from this natural diet ruined not only his health but his moral fiber as well . That is why we have suffering and disease , he claimed . The Stone Age Tasaday of the Philippines fulfilled his vision of the past . They had never eaten sugar or salt and lived in harmony with their environment . Of course , they had perfect teeth , beautiful bodies and were as gentle as woodland deer . Graham was convinced that a raw-food diet was best because it was close to nature . He felt such a regimen was excellent for the teeth and jaws and indispensable for healthy bowels . Only recently , two distinguished physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raw-food diet for chronic obesity and diabetes . Said the researchers , " By using rustic , simple observations , we found the cure for obesity . " One author tested the theory by living on leafy salads and raw sunflower seeds with water for two years . Why did the program work ? These experts concluded that uncooked foods leave the stomach slowly , require more chewing and continued on page 88 continued from page 36 leave " heat-labile " vitamins and enzymes intact . Graham did n't know what vitamins were , but he shrewdly observed that man was automatically protected from concentrated foods by eating raw foods . He insisted it was impossible to become fat with so much to chew . Chewing also depended upon good teeth , free of tartar and cavities . Graham set high value on personal hygiene , inside and out . Although Graham was enthusiastic about raw foods , he realized that people were devoted to baked bread . Indeed , bread had Biblical sanction . The bread he insisted upon , however , had to be complete . He warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put asunder , " referring to the divorce of the nutritious germ and bran from the wheat berry . Today , even experts think that people ate wholesome bread until the 1870s , when high-speed rollers extracted the germ and bran . This belief is untrue . The comic writer Tobias Smollett said in 1771 : " The bread 1 eat in London is a deleterious paste , mixed up with chalk , alum and bone-ashes . . the good people are not ignorant of this adulteration ; but they sacrifice their taste , and their health and the lives of their tender infants . . . and the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families . " Although the bread Graham complained of was not snowy , but rather freckled , it was certainly bad enough . It lacked fiber , which he called " bulk " or the " innutritious matter " in food . As a farm boy , he had noticed that animals fed purified foods grew sick . " It has been fully proved , " he said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nourishment . " This scientific proof , frequently cited , was that a dog fed on white bread died in 40 days , and another fed on whole meal flourished . We know today that wheat lacks an amino acid called lysine , but these reformers had no cause to be displeased with the experiment . All concentrated forms of food , Graham declared , were " unfriendly " to the vital interests of the body . He cited fats , sugar , honey , molasses and starch as " concentrated aliments , " to be used with discretion . Instead of slathering butter on bread , he suggested Graham butter , which was rich milk thickened with brown flour . He scoffed at the notion that bran was worthless or injurious to the colon . After all , he noted , man had fed on coarse grains for millennia . " We have a 36-foot length of colon , " he said . " Nature intended for us to use it .... Bran operates as a stimulus for the intestinal canal . " The mucilage of wheat bran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most soothing substances in the vegetable kingdom . . . . Chronic constipation and diarrhea spring from the same root . " And that pernicious root was lack of bulk . Anticipating Dr. Denis Hurkitt by 135 years , he asserted that even chronic disease could vanish when coarse foods were adopted . " Thousands , " he claimed , " are living witnesses of the virtues of real bread . " And he cited a critic of the 15th century as saying : " The eating of fine bread . is inimical to health and contrary to health and reason ; and it was first invented to gratify wanton and luxurious persons . " Graham went further than just promoting bulk foods . He insisted thatbread 's taste and nutrition depended upon the soil the grain was raised on ; soil properly composted with manure from healthy animals was obviously best . He often spoke of the land being debauched by greedy farmers . Because of his insistence on natural things , Graham supposed that unleavened bread was probably superior . But he contented himself with urging people to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eaten when a day old . Health crusaders were unanimous in condemning fragrant , hot bread . ( At the time , alcohol was thought to emerge from the loaf . ) Fresh bread sliced badly and begged for chunks of butter , but critics were far more concerned that bolting hot breads and muffins would discourage chewing . The authoress Sarah Hale said , " Hot bread , lying undigested , prostrates the system . " About hot dumplings , she added , " One might as well eat , with the hope of digesting ... a brick from the ruins of Babylon . " Of course , both she and Graham were adamant about the folly of lard pastries , rich cakes and puddings , confections and the essence of sin  --  hot mince pie . The latter was not just an orgy of lard crust , but contained enough whiskey , brandy and porter to fell a baby elephant ! Graham 's book Treatise on Bread , which once sold briskly for four dollars a dozen , is now a rare book , worth hundreds of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread-making was the province of the loving wife and mother  --  only the goddess of the hearth could suffuse her dough with the leaven of love . Bakers were only greedy scalawags , who adulterated their products with additives . ( One William Alcott once refused to surrender a recipe for Graham bread to a baker and said he was morally unfit for the task . ) Of course , bakers were furious with Graham 's ( quite accurate ) accusations about adulterated bread . They hooted at the notion that only good mothers could make good bread and that each home should have a grain mill and a fiddle ( doubtless to produce a harmonious loaf ) . A few bakers tried a commercial whole-wheat loaf , but most took the easy way  --  white flour with some bran and molasses . As Graham 's lectures on health and physiology grew in fame , they triggered lively reform . A weekly entitled The Graham Journal of Health and Longevity joined the 85-odd popular health magazines that flourished from 1830 to 1890 . Graham boarding houses sprang up and aroused praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the latter 's newspaper , the Liberator , the abolitionist Garrison lauded Graham 's system of dietetics and gave his books glowing praise . One article waxed lyrical about the joys of boarding-house living 1 . la Graham : superb bread , boiled spuds , crunchy apples and fresh air , unfouled with tobacco fumes or state whiskey . Roomers rose to bells and a brisk , cold shower after a serene night on a straw mattress . The reforming zeal reached college campuses , where frugal students welcomed cheap food . Oberlin College embraced a glorious experiment in total Graham living . The rules were so strict that one professor was fired for bringing a pepper shaker to meals ! Wearying of bleak porridge , stale bread and crust coffee , students finally petitioned successfully for relief . But staunch Graham supporters continued their brisk walks and workouts with Indian clubs and munched their way to glory . In 1834 Graham published a whole book of case histories , pompously entitled The Aesculapian Tablets of the Nineteenth Century , in which grateful patients revealed how a vegetable diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow travelers were a motley lot . They embraced the Bloomer bunch , the Quakers and the Shakers , the phrenologists , the free-lovers and the water-cure and gymnasium folks . Graham 's most famous disciple was , of course , Dr. John Harvey Kellogg , a consummate showman and leader of the Seventh-day Adventist Sanitarium . Indeed , the teachings of Graham underlie the whole Battle Creek movement . The first cold breakfast cereal , Granula , was simply Graham crackers , broken up and baked again . But Graham 's popularity waned as new stars took over the scene . He wasold and exhausted at 50 from a lecture schedule that once went 70 days in a row without rest . Sometimes he finished his lectures on his knees  --  not from " theater , " but from the pain . He retired to Northampton , Massachusetts , where he bombarded the local paper with solemn letters and worked feverishly on his masterwork , Meat and Wine in the Bible . Clad in slippers and a shabby dressing gown , he would wander the streets and mutter about domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man " to push him in a wheelbarrow to the local barber " professor , " in a vain hope to restore his strength . It was for naught . He went to his Creator after a good bath in 1851 at the age of 57 . Was Graham a failure ? He confided to a friend that someday people would tear down his house , stone by stone , and raise a monument . ( Always the orator  --  his house was frame . ) A failure ? J. H. Kellogg did n't think so . He himself died at 91 after decades of vigorous chewing , vegetables and cold showers . John D. Rockefeller did n't think so . He rebuilt his health on milk and Graham crackers , exercised daily and said good-by just a bit short of 98 years . No , Sylvester Graham was no failure . His insights on hygiene , exercise and diet were wonderfully modern . He knew nothing of soluble or insoluble fiber . All he did was eat it  --  the Scottish oatmeal of his ancestors , the unbolted breads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no fancy labs with caged rats , computers or electron microscopes . He did n't know lignin from a lightning rod , but he figured out the fiber story all by himself . Yes , he was vain , windy and eccentric . Sometimes he was gloriously wrong . But he had something special ? Yankee horse sense . So the next time you fill your plate at the salad bar or reach for the whole-wheat pita , think about Dr. Graham . The next time you bake your family some real bread , give that fragrant dough a squeeze for Sylvester . ( And go easy on the butter . ) We owe this Yankee minister a lot . Perhaps someone reading this article will even reach in his pocket and fulfill Graham 's confident dream  --  a 100-foot monument to his memory . But please : no giant graham cracker . . . .14 ;
