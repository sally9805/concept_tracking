A passing delight , Doug Flutie winds down a career too short <P> Because the biggest , greatest and best are tossed about so easily in sports , like footballs in the Miami rain , the most articulate superlative left may be just a gasp changing to a sigh , such as Doug Flutie brought to college football last week . The most cuddly player in history , or at least since Eddie LeBaron , appears about to run away with the Heisman trophy . Mindful that there have been stirring football finishes for 100 years , and rip-roaring games the equal of Boston College 's 47-45 victory over Miami , it can be fairly stated that never have a forward pass and a statue 's unveiling been more favorably timed . <P> As devoted as sportsmen are to collecting shiny gewgaws , this is the only athletic mantel piece that would be noticed at Westminster Abbey , and the thought of it cradled under the arm of Flutie , or vice versa , brings a smile . Exactly 25 Ibs. of bronze immortality , the Heisman figurine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 years to a literal-minded electorate that now numbers 1,050 experts , some of whom have seen a college football game this season . Although emblematic of the best player , whatever his position , the Heisman never has exalted an interior lineman , and runners have been preferred to quarterbacks . Flutie has the instincts of a runner ( " I just love tucking the ball and taking off " ) , but he is a quarterback from head to toe , a distance of 5 ft. 9 in . " I do n't know how I could play , " he says , " if the ball was n't in my hands and the game was n't in my control . " <P> Still , some four seasons and 11,000 yds. ago , he was willing to find out . Initially refused a scholarship at Boston College , then tendered the last one available after a coaching change , Flutie arrived from nearby Natick High as a fourth-stringer . By the final quarter of his fourth idle Saturday , glumly watching B.C. in its usual throes-this time trailing Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial at wide receiver , when the coach turned and scanned the bench . In the best tradition of the worst movies , Flutie went in and passed for 135 yds . <P> While Penn State won that game , the Nittany Lions make a good touchstone for the spectacular Flutie years . He threw on them for 520 yds. the next season , 380 the year after that and 447 a few weeks ago , getting on to a mile against one team alone . He has passed for 10,303 yds. in all and has run that up to 11,054 , both major-college records . But the cold figures are not what has warmed New Englanders , who as a rule show no more passion than penchant for this primal sport of Texas and Ohio . Boston College was 0-11 as recently as 1978 , and while the Eagles are currently 8-2 and bound for the Cotton Bowl , no one expects that to be their standard fare from now on . Locally , the Flutie phenomenon has been regarded as an age of delight that will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
