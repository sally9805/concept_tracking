DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 41She stood bent over in the road , crying , sobbing , hugging her knees , and slowly he got out of the car and walked toward her . The night air was beginning to sober him , and he looked different than he had before , no longer crazed , but gray and grim , and he had brought his friend along , who was silently watching them from the passenger seat of Billy 's long , sleek , dark green XKE . " I 'll drive you home . " He stood in the road , legs spread , the car headlights behind him glaring eerily at them . " Come on , Tan . " " Do n't caljme that . " She looked like a frightened little girl . He had never even been her friend , and now . . . and now . . . she wanted to scream each time she thought of it , but now she could n't even scream anymore , and she no longer had the strength to run away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dried blood over her face and on her thighs , and now she stared blankly at him , stumbling along the road , as he reached out and tried to grab her arm , and she screamed at him and darted away again . He stood and stared at her for a moment , and then got back in the car and drove off . He had offered to take her home , if she did n't want to go , to hell with her , and she stumbled along the road , aching from head to foot . Not twenty minutes later he was back again . He screeched to a halt beside her , got out , and grabbed her by the arm . She saw that the other boy was no longer in the car , and suddenly she wondered if he was going to rape her again . A wave of terror ran through her as he pulled her toward the car , and she pulled away , but this time he jerked her hard and shouted at her , and she could smell whiskey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd take you home . Now get in the fuckin ' car ! " He almost threw her onto the seat , and she realized that there was no arguing with him . She was alone with him , and he would do whatever he wanted with her . She had already learned that . She sat bleakly beside him in the XKE , and he roared off into the night , as she waited for him to take her somewhere else to rape her again , it all seemed so hopeless now . But he got on the highway , sank his foot to the floor , and the breeze whipping through the car seemed to sober both of them . He glanced over at her several times , and waved at a box of tissues on the floor . " You 'd better clean yourself up before you go home . " " Why ? " She looked straight ahead at the empty road . It wasafter two o'clock , and even her eyes felt numb . Only a few trucks went whizzing by , driving straight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " She did n't answer him , and she did n't turn to look at his face . She still half expected him to stop and try to rape her again , and this time she was expecting it . She would run as fast as she could , across the highway if she dared and maybe one of the trucks would stop . She still could n't believe what he had done to her , and she was wondering now if it had somehow been her fault , had she not fought him hard enough , had she done something to encourage him . . . ? they were hideous thoughts as she noticed the powerful sports car begin to weave . She turned and glanced at him , and noticed that he was falling asleep at the wheel . She jerked on his sleeve , and he started and looked at her . " Why the hell 'd you do that ? You could 've caused an accident . " She would have liked nothing better for him . She would have liked to see him lying dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling asleep . You 're drunk . " " Yeah ? So what ? " He sounded more tired than surly now , and he seemed all right for a while , until she saw the car weave again , but this time before she had a chance to grab his arm or shake him awake , an enormous trailer truck sped by , and the sports car veered . There was a hideous , grinding shriek of brakes , as the truck jackknifed and overturned , and miraculously the XKE whizzed just past the cab and came to rest with its nose crushed by a tree . Tana hit her head hard as they stopped , and she sat staring ahead for a long time , and then suddenly she was aware of a soft moaning beside her . His face was covered with blood and she did n't move . She just sat and stared , and then suddenly the door opened and there was a strong pair of hands on her arm , and then she began to scream . Suddenly the events of the endless night had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing and hysterically trying to run from the car , as two passing trucks stopped , and the drivers tried to subdue her until the cops came , but her eyes were uncomprehendingand wild . They were trying to stop the bleeding on Billy 's head , and he had a terrible gash over one eye . The police arrived a short time later , followed by an ambulance , and all three victims were taken to the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center nearby . The truck driver was almost instantly released . His vehicle had suffered more damage than he had , miraculously . Billy was42 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 43being stitched up . It was also noted that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol , and as his third offense , it would cost him his driver 's license for the next year , which seemed to worry him ' more than the wounded eye . Tana 's entire body seemed to be covered with blood , but oddly enough the staff noticed that most of it was dried . They could n't seem to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hyperventilated each time she tried . A pleasant young nurse gently wiped her off , while Tana just lay on the examining table and cried . They administered a sedative , and by the time her mother arrived at four o'clock she was half asleep . " What happened . . . ? my God ! " She was looking at the bandageon Billy 's eye . " Billy , will you be all right ? " " I guess . " He smiled sheepishly , and she noticed again what a handsome boy he was , although he had always looked less like his father and more like Marie . And suddenly the smile faded and he looked terrified . " Did you call Dad ? " Jean Roberts shook her head . " I did n't want to frighten him . They told me you were all right when they called , and I thought I 'd take a good look at you both first myself . " " Thanks . " He glanced over at Tana 's dozing form and then shrugged almost nervously . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . we wrecked the car .... " " The important thing is that neither of you were badly hurt . " She frowned as she looked at Tana 's matted blond hair , but there was no longer any evidence of blood anywhere , and the nurse tried to explain how hysterical Tana had been . " We gave her a sedative . She should sleep for a while . " Jean Roberts frowned . " Was she drunk ? " She already knew that Billy was , but there would be hell to pay if Tana was too , but the young nurse shook her head . " I do n't think she was . Mostly frightened , I think . She got a nasty little bump on the head , but nothing more than that . We do n't see any evidence of concussion or whiplash , but I 'd keep an eye on her . " And as she said the words , hearing them talking around her , Tana woke up , and she looked at her mother as though she had never seen her before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in her arms and made gentle cooing sounds . " It 's all right , baby . . . it 's all right .... " She shook her head violently , taking great gulps of air , " No , it'snot . . . it 's not .. he . . . " But Billy stood there staring at her , with an evil look in his eye , and she could n't say the words . He looked as though he would hit her again , and she turned away , choking on her sobs , still feeling his eyes on her . She could n't look at him again . . . could n't see him ... never wanted to see him again , . . She lay on the backseat of the Mercedes her mother had driven out , and they took Billy home . And Jean was inside with him for a long time . They threw the last people out , made half a dozen others get out of the pool , tossed two couples out of Ann 's bed , and told the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back to the car where Tana still was , she knew she had her week 's work cut out for her . They had destroyed half the furniture , set fire to some of the plants , spoiled the upholstery , left spots on the rugs , and there was everything from plastic glasses to whole pineapples in the pool . She did n't want Arthur to even see the place until she had had it set to rights again . She got into the car with a long tired sigh , and glanced at Tana 's still form . Her daughter seemed strangely calm now . The sedative had taken effect . " Thank God they did n't go into Arthur 's room . " She started the car , and Tana shook her head with a silent no , but she could n't say the words . " Are you all right ? " That was really all that mattered . They could have been killed . It was a miracle they had n't been . It was all she could think of when the phone rang at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours , and instinctively , when she had heard the phone , she had known . And she had answeredit on the first ring . " How do you feel ? " All she could do was stare at her mother and shake her head . " I want to go home . " The tears slid down her cheeks again , and Jean wondered again if she was drunk . It had obviously been a wild night , and Tana had been part of it . She also noticed that she was n't wearing the same dress she 'd been wearing when she left . " Did you go for a swim ? " She sat up , her head reeling , and shook her head , as her mother glanced at her in the mirror and saw the strange look in Tana 's eyes . " What happened to your dress ? " She spoke in a cold hard voice that did n't even sound like her to Jean 's ears . " Billy tore it off . " " He did what ? " She looked surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the pool ? " It was the only image she had of him , and even if he had been a little drunk , he was harmless enough . It was just damn lucky he had n't hit the truck . It was a good lesson for them both . " I hope you learned a lesson tonight , Tan . " She began to sob again at the sound of the nickname Billy had used until finally Jean pulled off the road and stared at her . " What 's happening to you ? Are you drunk ? Did you take drugs ? " There was accusation in her voice , in her eyes , and none of that had been there when she drove Billy home . How unfair life was , Tana thought to herself . But her mother just did n't understand what Precious Little Billy Durninghad done . She looked straight into her mother 's eyes . " Billy raped me in his father 's room . " " Tana ! " Jean Roberts looked horrified . " How can you say a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Her anger was at her own child , not at her lover 's son . She could n't believe a thing like that about Billy , and it was written all over her face as she glared at her only child . " That 's a terrible thing to say . " It was a terrible thing to do . But Jean only stared at her . Two lonely tears rolled relentlessly down Tana 's cheeks . " He did . " Her face crumbled at the memory . " I . . . swear . . . " She was getting hysterical again as Jean turned and started the car , and this time she did not glance into the backseat again . " I do n't ever want to hear you say a thing like that again , about anyone . " Surely not someone they knew . . . a harmless boy they had known for half his life . . . she did n't even care to think about what would make Tana say a thing like that , jealousy perhaps of Billy himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear you say that again . Is that clear ? " But there was no answer from the backseat . Tana just sat there , looking glazed . She would never say it again . About anyone . Something inside her had just died . Ghapter 4The summer sped past Tana easily after that . She spent two weeks in New York , recuperating , while her mother went to work every day . And Jean was concerned about her , but in an odd , uncomfortable way . There seemed to be nothing wrong with her , but she would sit and stare into space , listening to nothing , not seeing her friends . She would n't answer the phone when Jean , or anyone else , called . Jean even mentioned it to Arthur at the end of the first week . She almost had the house in Greenwich put to rights again , and Billy and his friends had moved on to Malibu to visit other friends . They had all but destroyed the house at the pool , but the worst damage of all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as though it had been cut out with a knife . And Arthur had had plenty to say to his son about that . " What kind of savages are all of you ? I ought to be sending you to West Point instead of Princeton for chrissake so they can teach you a thing or two about how to behave . My God , in my day , no one I 'd ever known would behave like that . Did you see that carpeting ? They tore the whole damn thing up . " Billy had looked both subduedand chagrined . " I 'm sorry , Dad . Things got a little out of hand . " " A little ? And it 's a wonder you and the Roberts girl were n't killed . " But on the whole he 'd been all right . His eye was still bothering him a little when he left , but the stitches on the eyebrow had already been removed . And he still seemed to be out every night right up until they left for Malibu . " Damn wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's Tana now ? " She had mentioned to Arthur several times how oddly Tana had behaved , and she really46 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 47wondered if she had n't had a worse blow on the head than they had first thought . " You know she was almost delirious that first night . . . in fact she was . . . " She still remembered the ridiculous tale about Billy that Tana had tried to tell . The girl really was n't all there and Arthur looked worried too . " Have her looked at again . " But when Jean tried to insist , Tana refused . Jean almost wondered if she was well enough to go to New England for her summer job , but on the night before she was due to leave , she quietly packed her bag , and the next morning , she came to the breakfast table with a pale , wan , tired face , but for the first time in two weeks , when Jean handed her a glass of orange juice , she smiled , and Jean almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tomb since the accident . There were no sounds , no music , no laughter , no giggles on the phone , no voices , only dead silence everywhere . And Tana 's deadened eyes . " I 've missed you , Tan . " At the sound of the familiar name , Tana 's eyes filled with tears . She nodded her head , unable to say anything . There was nothing left for her to say . To anyone . She felt as if her life were over . She never again wanted to be touched by a man , and she knew she never would again . No one would ever do to her what Billy Durning had done , and the tragedy was that Jean could n't face hearing it , or thinking it . In her mind , it was impossible , so it did n't exist , it had n't happened . But the worst of it was that it had . " Do you really think you 're up to going to camp ? " Tana had wondered about that herself ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spend the rest of her life hiding there , like a cripple , a victim , someone shrivelled and brokenand gone , or she could begin to move out again , and she had decided to do that . " I 'll be all right . " " Are you sure ? " She seemed so quiet , so subdued , so suddenly grown up . It was as though the bump on her head in the car accidenthad stolen her youth from her . Perhaps the fear itself had done that . Jean had never seen such a dramatic change in such a short time . And Arthur kept insisting that Billy had been fine , remorseful , but almost his old self by the time he left for his summer holiday , which was certainly not the case here . " Look , sweetheart , if you do n't feel up to it , just come home . You want to start college in the fall feeling strong . " " I 'll be all right . " It was almost all she said before she left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vermont as she had twice before . It was a summer job she had loved , but it was different this year , and the others noticed it too . She was quieter , kept to herself , and never seemed to laugh anymore . The only time she talked to anyone at all was with the campers themselves . It saddenedthe others who had known her before , " something must be wrong at home .... " " Is she sick ... ? " " Wow , she 's like a differentgirl .... " Everyone noticed , and no one knew . And at the end of the summer , she got on the bus and went home again . She had made no friends this year , except among the kids , but even with them , she was n't as popular as she 'd been before . She was even prettier than she 'd been in previous years but all of the kids agreed this time , " Tana Roberts is weird . " And she knew herself that she was . She spent two days at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed her bags for school , and boarded the train with a feeling of relief . Suddenly , she wanted to get far , far from home ... from Arthur . . . from Jean . . . from Billy . . . from all of them . . . even the friends she 'd had at school . She was n't the same carefree girl who had graduated three months before . She was someone different now , someone haunted and hurt , with scars on her soul . And as she sat on the train and rolled through the South , she slowly began to feel human again . It was as though she had to get far , far from them , from their deceptions , their lies , the things they could n't see , or refused to believe , the games they played .. . it was as though ever since Billy Durning had forced his way into her , no one could see her anymore . She did n't exist , because they could n't acknowledge Billy 's sin . . . but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ? If her own mother did n't believe her .. she did n't want to think about it anymore . Did n't want to think about any of it . She was going as far away as she could , and maybe she 'd never go home , although she knew that too was a lie . Her mother 's last words to her had been , " You 'll come home for Thanksgiving , wo n't you , Tan ? " It was as though her mother was afraid of her now , as though she had seen something in her daughter'seyes that she just could n't face , a kind of bleeding , open , raw pain that she could n't help and did n't want to be there . She didn't48 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 49want to go home for Thanksgiving , did n't want to go home ever again . She had escaped their tiny , petty lives . . . the hypocrisy ... Billy and his barbaric friends . . . Arthur and the years and years he had used Jean . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lies Jean told herself . . , suddenly Tana could n't stand it anymore , and she could n't go far enough to get away from them . Maybe she 'd never go back . . . never . ... She loved the sound of the train , and she was sorry when it stopped in Yolan . Green Hill College was two miles away and they had sent a lumbering old station wagon for her , with an old black driver with white hair . He greeted her with a warm smile , but she looked at him suspiciously as he helped her load her bags . " You been on the train long , miss ? " " Thirteen hours . " She barely spoke to him on the brief drive to the school , and had he even seemed about to stop the car , she would have leapt out and begun to scream . But he sensed that about her , and he did n't push her by trying to get too friendly with her . He whistled part of the way , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep South that Tana had never heard before , and in spite of herself , when they arrived , she smiled at him . " Thanks for the ride . " " Anytime , miss . Just come on down to the office and ask for Sam , I 'll give you a ride anywhere you want to go . " And then he laughed the warm black laugh , smiling at her . " There ai n't too many places to go around here . " He had the accent of the Deep South , and ever since she had gotten off the train she had noticed how beautiful everything was . The tall majestic looking trees , the bright flowers everywhere , the lush grass , and the air still , heavy and warm . One had a sudden urge to just stroll off somewhere quietly , and when she saw the college itself for the first time , she just stood there and smiled . It was all she had wanted it to be , she had wanted to come here to visit the winter before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had interviewed with their traveling representative up North , and gone on what she 'd seen in the brochures . She knew that academically they were one of the best schools , but she had actually wanted something more  --  their reputation , and the legends she had heard about what a fine old school it was . It was old-fashioned , she knew , but in a way that appealed to her . And now as she looked at the handsome white buildings , perfectlykept , with tall columns , and beautiful French windows look-ing out on a small lake , she almost felt as though she had come home . She checked in at the reception room , filled in some cards , wrote down her name on a long list , found out what building she 'd be living in , and a little while later , Sam was helping her again , loading all of her luggage on an old country cart . It was almost like a trip back in time just being there , and for the first time in months , she felt peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , would n't have to explain how she felt or did n't feel , would n't have to hear the hated Durning name , or see the unknowing pain Arthur inflicted on her mother 's face . . . or hear about Billy again .. . just being in the same town with them had stifled her , and for the first month or two after the rape , all she had wanted to do was run away . It had taken all the courage she had to go on to camp that summer anyway , and each day there had been a battle too . She wanted to flinch each time someone came too close , especially the men , but even the boys frightened her now too . At least she did n't have to worry about that here . It was an all-women 's school , and she did n't have to attend the dances or proms , or nearby football games . The social life had appealed to her when she had first applied , but she did n't care about that now . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't in three months . . . but suddenly . . . suddenly . . . even the air here smelled good , and as Sam rolled the luggage cart along , she looked at him with a slow smile and he grinned at her . " It 's a long way from New York . " His eyes seemed to dance , and the nubby white hair looked soft . " It sure is . It really is beautiful here . " She glanced out at the lake and then back at the buildings behind her , fanned out , with still smaller buildings ahead of them . It looked almost like a palatial estate , which was what it had once been , everything was so perfectlymanicured , immaculately kept . She was almost sorry her mother could n't see it now , but perhaps she would eventually . " It used to be a plantation , you know . " He told hundreds of girls that every year . He loved to tell the story to the girls . His granddaddy had been a slave right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wide eyes . They were so young and so fine , almost like his own daughter had been , except she was a grown50 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 51woman now , with children of her own . And these girls would be married and have children soon too . He knew that every year , in the spring , girls came back from everywhere to get married in the beautiful church right there on the grounds , and after graduation ceremonies , there were always at least a dozen who got married in the ensuing days . He glanced at Tana as she loped along at his side , wondering how long this one would last . She was one of the pretti est girls he had ever seen , with long shapely legs , and that face , the shaft of golden hair , and those enormous green eyes . If he 'd known her for a while he would have teased her and told her she looked like a movie star , but thisone was more reserved than most . He had noticed all along that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head , looking up at the building where he had just stopped the cart . " This is one of the nicest houses we got . Jasmine House . I 've already brought five girls here today . There should be about twenty-five or so here in all , and a housemother to keep an eye on all of you , " he beamed , " though I 'm sure none of you will be needing that . " He laughed his deep , rich burst of laughter again , which sounded almost musical , and Tana smiled , helping him with some of her bags . She followed him inside , and found herself in a pleasantly decorated living room . The furniture was almost en tirely antique , English and Early American , the fabrics were flow ery and bright , and there were big bouquets of flowers in large handsome crystal vases on several tables and a desk . There was a homey atmosphere as Tana stepped in and looked around , and one of the first things that struck her about the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat , and as though one ought to be wearing a hat and white gloves , and suddenly Tana looked down at her plaid skirt , her loafers and knee socks , and smiled at the woman coming across the room to her in a neat gray suit . She had white hair and blue eyes . She was their housemother , Tana soon learned . She had been housemother of Jasmine House for more than twenty years , she had a gentle Southern drawl , and when her jacket opened , Tana noticed a single strand of pearls . She looked like someone 's aunt , and there were deep smile lines around her eyes . " Welcome to Jasmine House , my dear . " There were eleven other houses on campus much like this , " but we like to think that Jasmine is the very best . " She beamed at Tana , and offered her a cup of tea as Sam took her bags upstairs . Tana accepted the floweredcup with the silver spoon , declined a plate of bland looking little cakes , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how strange life was . She felt as though she had landed in a different universe . Things were so different from New York . . . suddenly here she was , far from everyone she knew , drinking tea and talking to this woman with blue eyes and pearls . . . when only three months before she had been lying on Arthur Durning 's bedroom floor being raped and beaten by his son . " . . . , do n't you think , dear ? " Tana stared blankly at the housemother , not sure of what she had just said , and demurely nodded her head , feeling suddenly tired . It was so much to take in all at once . " Yes . . . yes . . . I do .... " She was n't even sure what she was agreeing with , and suddenly all she wanted to do was escape to her room . At last , they finished their tea , set down their cups , and Tana had a sudden urge to laugh , wondering just how much tea the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as though sensing Tana 's impatience to settle in , she led the way to her room . It was up two handsomely curved flights of stairs , on a long hall , with flower prints and photographs of alumnae interspersed . Her room was at the very end of the hall . The walls were a pale pink , the curtains and bedspreads chintz . There were two narrow beds , two very old chests , two chairs , and a tiny corner sink . It was a funny old-fashionedroom and the ceiling sloped directly over their beds . The housemother was watching her and seemed satisfied as Tana turned to her with a smile . " This is very nice . " " Every room in Jasmine House is . " She left the room shortly after that , and Tana sat staring at her trunks , not quite sure what to do , and then she lay down on her bed , looking out at the trees . She wondered if she should wait for her roommate to arrive before simply taking over one of the chests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel like unpacking anyway . She was thinking of taking a walk around the lake when she heard a knock on the door and suddenly Old Sam appeared . She sat up quickly on the edge of the bed , and he walked into the room carrying two bags with a strange look on his face . He glanced over at where Tana sat , seemed to shrug , and just looked at her . " I guess this is a first for us . " What is ? Tana looked confused as52 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 53 he shrugged again and disappeared , and Tana glanced over at the bags . But there seemed nothing remarkable there , two large navy blue and green plaid bags with railroad tags , a makeup case , and a round hatbox , just like the ones filled with Tana 's junk . She wan- dered slowly around the room , wondering when their owner would appear . She expected an endless wait as she imagined the tea ritual , but in the end she was surprised at how quickly the girl appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes portentously as she opened the door , and then stood aside , as Sharon Blake seemed to float into the room . She was one of the most striking girls Tana thought she had ever seen , with jet black hair pulled tightly back , brilliant onyx eyes , teeth whiter than ivory in a pale cocoa face that was so finely etched it barely seemed real . Her beauty was so marked , her movements so graceful , her style so definite that she literally took Tana 's breath away . She was wearing a bright red coat , and a small hat , and she tossed both swiftly into one of the room 's two chairs , to reveal a narrow tube of gray wool dress , the exact same color as her well-made gray shoes . She looked more like a fashion plate than a college girl , and Tana inwardly groaned at the things she had brought . They were all kilts and slacks , old wool skirts that she did n't really care about , a lot of plain shirts , V neck sweaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before she left . " Tana , " the housemother 's voice said that she took the intro duction very seriously , " this is Sharon Blake . She 's from the North too . Although not as far North as you .

" She seemed to look at Sharon almost with a look of pain , and Tana with immeasurable sympathy . It cut her to the core to do this to her , but someone had to sleep with the girl , and Tana was a scholarship student after all . It was only fair . She had to be grateful for whatever she got . And the others would n't have put up with it . She softly closed the door , and walked downstairs with a determined step . It was the first time this had ever happened at Jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia Jones was wishing that she could have had something a little stronger than tea that afternoon . She needed it . It was a terrible strain , after all . But upstairs Sharon only laughed as she threw herself into one of the room 's uncomfortable chairs and looked at Tana 's shining blond hair . They were an interestingly contrasted pair . The one so fair , the other dark . They eyed each other curiously as Tana smiled , wondering what she was doing there . It would have been easier for her to go to a college in the North , than to come here . But she did n't know Sharon Blake yet . The girl was beautiful , there was no doubt about that , and she was expensively dressed . Tana noticed that again , too , as Sharon kicked off her shoes . " Well , " the delicate , dark face broke into a smile again , " what do you think of Jasmine House ? " " It 's pretty , do n't you think ? " Tana still felt shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely girl .

" " I looked as we walked down the hall . " She sighed then and carefully took off her hat . " I expected that . " And then she looked Tana over appraisingly . " And what sin did you commit to wind up rooming with me ? " She smiled gently at Tana . She knew why she was there , she was the only token Negro to be accepted at Green Hill , and she was unusual , of course . Her father was an author of distinguished prose , winner of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize , her mother was an attorney , currently in government , she would be different from most Negro girls .

" Sharon had been shocked . " They would n't even let me in. " 54 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 55Miriam had glared at her . " You do n't understand yet , do you , babe ? Your father is Freeman Blake . He 's written books that people have read all around the world . Do you really think they 'd dare to keep you out today ? " Sharon had grinned nervously . " Hell , yes . Mama , they 'd tar and feather me before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what had happened in Little Rock three years before . She read the news . It had taken tanks and the National Guard to keep black children in a white school . And this was n't just any little old school they were talking about . This was Green Hill . The most exclusive woman 's junior college in the South , where daughters of Congressmen and Senators , and the governors of Texas and South Carolina and Georgia sent their little girls , to get two years of smarts before settling down with boys of their own kind . " Mama , that 's nuts ! " " If every black girl in this country thinks like that , Sharon Blake , then a hundred years from now we 'll still be sleeping in black hotels , sitting at the back of the bus , and drinking out of water fountains that reek of white boys ' piss . " Her mother 's eyes had blazed at her as Sharon winced . Miriam Blake thought that way , she always had . She had gone to Radcliffe on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , she had fought hard for what she believed , for the underdog , the common man , and she was fighting for her people now . Even her husband admired her . She had more guts than anyone he 'd ever known and she was n't going to stop now . But it frightened Sharon sometimes . It frightened her a lot . As it had when she applied to Green Hill . " What if I get in ? " That scared her most of all and she told her father that . " I 'm not like her , Daddy . . . I do n't want to prove a point . . . to just get in . . . I want to have friends , to have a good time . . . what she wants me to do is too hard .... " Tears had filled her eyes and he understood . But he could n't change either of them , Miriam and what she expected of them all , or the happy-golucky , fun-loving , beautiful girl , who was less like Miriam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an actress on the Broadway stage one day . And she wanted to go to UCLA . " You can go there for your last two years , Shar , " her mother said , " after you pay your dues . " " Why do I have to pay any dues at all ? " she screamed . " Why do I owe anyone two years of my life ? " " Because you live here in your father 's house , in a comfortable suburb of Washington , and you sleep in your nice , warm bed , thanks to us , and you 've never known a life of pain . " " So beat me , then . Treat me like a slave , but let me do what I want to do ! " " Fine . " Her mother 's eyes had blazed black fire . " Do what you want . But you 'll never walk proud , girl , not if all you think of is yourself . You think that 's what they did in Little Rock ? They walked every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , and the Klan itching for their necks every day . And you know who they did it for , girl ? They did it for you . And who 're you going to do it for , Sharon Blake ? " " Myself ! " She had screamed before running up the stairs to her room and slamming the door . But the words had haunted her . Her mother 's words always did . She was n't an easy person to live with , or to know , or to love . She never made things comfortable for anyone . But in the long run , she made things good . For everyone . Freeman Blake had tried to talk to his wife that night . He knew how Sharon felt , how badly she wanted to go to the western school . " Why do n't you let her do what she wants for a change ? " " Because she has a responsibility . And so do I , and so do you . " " Do n't you ever think of anything else ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to burn for a cause . Maybe you do enough of that for all of us . " But they both knew that that was n't entirely true . Sharon 's brother Dick was only fifteen , but he was Miriam to the core , and he shared most of her ideas , except that his were angrier , more radical . No one was ever going to shove him down , and Freeman was proud of that , but he also recognized that Sharon was a different child . " Just let her be . " They had , and in the end , the guilt had won , as she told Tana later that night . " So here I am . " They had been to dinner in the main dining hall , and were back in their room . Sharon in a pink nylon nightgown that had been a going away present from her best friend at home , and Tana in a blue flannel nightgown , her hair in a long silky ponytail as she watched her new friend . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sighed and looked at the pink polish she had just applied to her toes , and then looked up at Tana again. 56 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 57 " She expects so damn much of me . " And all she wanted for herself was to be beautiful and smart and a great actress one day . That was enough . Except for Miriam Blake . Tana smiled . " My mother expects a lot too . She 's devoted her whole damn life to doing the right thing for me , and all she wants me to do is come here for a year or two , and then marry some nice young man . ' " She made a face which suggested she found it an unappealing idea , and Sharon laughed . " Secretly that 's what all mothers think , even mine , as long as I promise to crusade even after I marry him . What does your father say ? Thank God for mine , he gets me off the hook whenever he can . He thinks all that stuff is a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was born . That 's why she gets so excited about everything . She 's always scared to death that everything 's going to go wrong , so she clutches whatever security we have , and she expects me to do the same . " She looked strangely at Sharon then , " You know , actually your mother sounds more like my cup of tea . " The two girls laughed and it was another two hours before they turned off the lights , and by the end of the first week at Green Hill , the two girls were fast friends . They shared much of the same schedule , met for lunch , went to the library , went for long walks around the lake , talking about life , about boys , about parents and friends . Tana told Sharon about her mother 's relationship with ArthurDurning , even when he was married to Marie , and how she felt about him . The hypocrisy , the narrow views , the stereotyped life in Greenwich with children and friends and associates all of whom drank too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while her mother slaved for him night and day , lived for his calls , and had nothing to show for it after twelve years . " I mean , Christ , Shar , it really burns me up . And you know the worst thing about it ? " Her eyes smoldered like fiery green rocks as she looked at her friend . " The worst thing is that she accepts all that shit from him . It 's all right with her . She 'd never walk out on him , and she 'd never ask for more . She 'll just sit there for the rest of her life , grateful for all the menial things she does for him , totally unaware that he does nothing for her , while she insists that she owes everything to him . What everything ? She 's worked like a dog all her life for whatever she has , and he treats her like a piece of furniture .... " ... a paid cunt ... Billy 's words still rang in her ears and she forced them fromher head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . she just sees things differently , but it makes me mad as hell . I ca n't go around kissing his ass for the rest of my life . I owe my mother a lot , but I do n't owe Arthur Durning a damn thing , and neither does she , but she just does n't see it that way . She 's so damn scared all the time . . . . I wonder if she was like that before my father died . ... " Her mother often told her that she was a lot like him , and her face kind of lit up . " I like my dad better than my mom . " Sharon was always honest about what she felt , especially with Tana . They had told each other countless secrets by the end of the first month , although the one thing Tana had said nothing about was the rape . Somehow she could never quite bring the words to her mouth , and she told herself that it did n't matter anyway , but a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring boys ' school , Sharon rolled her eyes and lay back on her bed . " So much for that . What do I do ? Go as a black cat , or in a white sheet as a member of the Klan ? " Girls were welcome to come to the dance alone , since it was to be held at Green Hill , which was fortunate since neither Sharon nor Tana had dates . Nor did they have any friends . The girls had all been careful not to get too close to her . They were polite to her , and none of them stared anymore , and all of the teachers treated her courteously , but it was almost as though they wanted to pretend that she was n't there , as though by ignoring her , she would disappear . And the only friend she had was Tana , who went everywhere with her , and as a result , Sharon was Tana 's only friend . Everyone stayed away from her too . If she wanted to play with niggers , she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about it more than once . " Why the hell do n't you go play with your own kind ! " She had tried to sound harsh but Tana had always seen through the ruse . " Go to hell . " " You 're a damn fool . " " Good . That makes two of us . That 's why we get along so well . " " Nah , " Sharon would grin at her , " we get along because you dress like shit and if you did n't have my wardrobe and my expert advice at hand you 'd go out looking like a total jerk . " " Yeah , " Tana grinned delightedly , " you 're right . But can you teach me to dance ? " The girls would collapse on their beds , and you58 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 59could hear their laughter out in the hall almost every night . Sharon had an energy and a spunk and a fire about her that brought Tana back to life again , and sometimes they just sat around and told jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cried . Sharon also had a sense of style which Tana had never seen before , and the most beautiful clothes she had ever seen . They were both about the same size and after a while , they just began to shove everything into the same drawers , and wear whatever came to hand . " So . . . what are you going to be for Halloween , Tan ? " Sharon was doing her nails a bright orange this time , and it looked spectacular against her brown skin . She glanced at the wet polish and then over at her friend , but Tana looked noncommittal as she looked away . " I do n't know . . . I 'll seed ... " " What does that mean ? " She was quick to sense something different in Tana 's voice , something she had never heard there before , except maybe once or twice when Sharon suspected that she had hit a nerve , but she was n't yet sure what that nerve was , or precisely where it lay . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched , and then looked away . " No . I 'm not . " " For heaven 's sake , why not ? " She looked stunned . Tana liked having a good time . She had a great sense of humor , she was a pretty girl , she was fun to be around , she was bright . " Do n't you like Halloween ? " " It 's all right . . . for kids .... " It was the first time Sharon had seen her behave like that and she was surprised . " Do n't be a party pooper , Tan . Come on , I 'll put your costume together for you . " She began digging into the closet they shared , pulling things out and throwing them on the bed , but Tana did not look amused , and that night when the lights were out , Sharon questionedher about it again . " How come you do n't want to go to the Halloween dance , Tan ? " She knew that she had n't had any dates yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a particularly lonely road , as the only black girl at the school , but she had resigned herself to that when she had agreed to come to Green Hill , and none of them really knew anyone yet . Only a few lucky girls had already won dates , but they were sure to meet a flock of young menat the dance , and Sharon was suddenly dying to get out . " Do you have a steady at home ? " She had n't mentioned it yet . Sharon thought it unlikely that she had held back , although there were some things they still had n't shared . They had avoided the subject of their virginity , or lack of it , which Sharon knew was unusual at Jasmine House . It seemed as though everyone else was anxious to discuss their status as far as that went , but Sharon had correctly sensed Tana 's reticence , and she was n't anxious to discuss the subjectherself . But she propped herself up on one elbow now and looked at Tana in the moonlit room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . . . . I just do n't like going out . " " Any particular reason why not ? You 're allergic to men ? .. . get dizzy in heels ? . . . turn into a vampire after twelve o'clock ? ... although actually , " she grinned mischievously , " that might be kind of a neat trick on Halloween . " In the other bed , Tana laughed . " Do n't be a jerk . I just do n't want to go out , that 's all . It 's no big deal . You go . Go fall in love with some white guy and drive your parents nuts . " They both laughed at the prospect of that . " Christ , they 'd probably kick me out of school . If old Mrs. Jones had her choice , they 'd be fixing me up with Old Sam . " The housemotherhad several times looked patronizingly at Sharon , and then glanced at Sam , as though there were some kind of kinship between them . " Does she know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Pulitzer , and everyone in the country knew his name , whether they had read his books or not . " I do n't think she can read . " " Give her an autographed book when you come back from the holidays . " Tana grinned and Sharon roared . " She 'd die . .. . " But it still did n't solve the problem of the Halloween dance . In the end , Sharon went as an excruciatingly sexy black cat , in a black leotard , her warm cocoa face peeking out , her eyes huge , her legs seeming to stretch forever , and after an initial tense moment or two , someone asked her to dance , and she was on the floor all night long . She had a terrific time , although none of the girls talked to her , and Tana was tucked into bed and sound asleep when she got home just after one o'clock . " Tan ? . . . Tana ? . . . 60 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 61Tan ... ? " She stirred faintly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groan . " D' ya have a good time ? " " It was great ! I danced all night ! " She was dying to tell her all about it but Tana had already turned over in bed . " I 'm glad . . . g'night .... " Sharon watched the other girl 's back and wondered again why she had n't gone , but nothing more was said , and when Sharon tried to bring it up again the next day , it was obvious that Tana did n't want to talk about it . The other girls began going out after that . The phone in the downstairs hall seemed to ring all the time , and only one boy called Sharon Blake . He asked her to a movie and she went , but when they arrived , the ticket taker would n't let them in . " This ai n't Chicago , friends "  --  he glared at them as the boy blushed a deep , anguished red  --  " you 're in the South now . " He addressed the young man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sharon was reassuring when they left . " I did n't want to see it anyway . Honest , Tom , it 's all right . " But the silence was agonizing as he drove her back , and finally when they reached Jasmine House , she turned to him . Her voice was sultry and soft , her eyes kind , her hand like velvet as she touched his . " It really is all right , Tom . I understand . I 'm used to this . " She took a deep breath . " That 's why I came to Green Hill . " It seemed an odd thing to say and he looked questioningly at her . She was the first black girl he had ever asked out , and he thought her the most exotic creature he had ever seen . " You came here to be insulted by some turd in a movie house in a one horse town ? " He was still burning inside , he was angry for her even if she was not . " No , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came here to change things , I guess . It starts like this , and it goes on for a long time , and eventually no one gives a damn , black girls and white guys go to movies , ride in cars , walk down streets , eat hamburgers anywhere they want . It happens in New York . Why should n't it happen here ? People may look , but at least there they do n't throw you out . And the only way to get to that point is to start small , like tonight . " The boy looked at her , suddenly wondering if he 'd been used but somehow he did n't think he had . Sharon Blake was n't like that , and he had already heard who her father was . You had to be impressed by someone like that . And he admired her more afterwhat she had just said . It confused him a little bit , but he knew that there was truth in it . " I 'm sorry we did n't get in . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . " I did n't mean that we had to change it all at once . " But she liked his spunk . He was getting the idea , and maybe her mother had n't been so wrong . Maybe it was all right to serve a cause after all . " Why not ? Sooner or later that guy 'll get tired of kicking us out . Hell , we can go to the coffee shop . . . the restaurant across town . ... " The possibilities were limitless and Sharon was laughing at him , as he helped her out of the car and walked her into Jasmine House . She offered him a cup of tea , and they were going to sit in the living room for a while , but the looks they got from the other couples sitting there were so ominous that eventually Sharon got up . She walked him slowly to the door , and for a moment she looked sad . It would have been so much easier at Columbia UCLA .. . anywhere in the North . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to sense her mood , and he whispered as he stood in the open door . " Remember . . . it does n't happen overnight . " He touched her cheek then and was gone , as she watched him drive away .. . he was right , of course . . . it did n't happen overnight . And as she walked upstairs , she decided that it had n't been a totally wasted night . She liked Tom , and wondered if he would call her again . He was a good sport . " Well ? Did he propose ? " Tana was grinning at her from the bed as Sharon walked in , and groaned . " Yeah . Twice . " " That 's nice . How was the movie ? " Sharon smiled . " Ask someone else . " " You did n't go ? " She was surprised . " They did n't let us in . . . you know . . . white boy .. . brown girl . . . Find yourself a decent girl , son .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in her eyes , and she frowned . " The shits . What did Tom say ? " " He was nice . We sat downstairs for a while when we got back , but that was even worse . There must be seven Snow Whites sitting downstairs with their Prince Charmings , and all of them had theireyes glued on us . " She sighed and sat down , looking at her friend . " Shit . . . my mother and her bright ideas . . . for about a minute outside the movie house I felt very noble and brave and pure , and by the time we got back , I decided it was really a huge pain in the ass . Hell , we ca n't even go out for a hamburger . I could starve to death in this town . " " Not if you went out with me , I 'll bet . " They had n't gone out to eat yet , they were too comfortable where they were , and the food was surprisingly good at school . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon 's chagrin . " Do n't be so sure , Tan . I 'll bet they 'd raise hell if I tried to go somewhere with you too . Black is black and white is white , no matter how you look at it . " " Why do n't we try ? " Tana looked intrigued , and the next night they did . They walked slowly into town , and stopped for a hamburgerand the waitress gave them a long , slow , ugly look and then walked away without serving them , as Tana looked at her in shock . She signaled for her again , and the woman appeared not to see , until finally Tana walked over to her , and asked if they could order their dinner now , and the waitress looked at her with chagrin . She spoke in a low voice so that Sharon would n't hear . " I 'm sorry , honey . I ca n't serve your friend . I was hoping you two 'd get the idea . " " Why not ? She 's from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . her mother is an attorney and her father has won the Pulitzer twice .... " " That do n't make no difference here . This ai n't Washington . It 's Yolan . " Yolan , South Carolina , home of Green Hill . " Is there anywhere in town we can eat ? " The waitress looked nervously at the tall green-eyed blonde , there was a hardness in her voice that suddenly frightened her . " There 's a place for her just down the street . . . and you could eat here . " " I mean together , " Tana 's eyes were as hard as green steel , and for the first time in her life she felt something tighten in her spine . She almost wanted to hit someone . It was a feeling she had n't known before , an unreasoning , helpless rage . " Is there anyplace in this town where we can eat together , without taking the train to New York ? " Tana glared at her , and slowly the waitress shook herhead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I 'll have two cheeseburgers , and two Cokes . " " No , you wo n't . " A man appeared from the kitchen behind where they stood . " You 'll go back to that damn fancy school you two come from , " they were easily spotted in Yolan . Sharon 's clothes alone were enough to draw attention anywhere . She was wearing a skirt and sweater her mother had bought her at Bonwit Teller in New York . " And you can eat anything you damn well please there . I do n't know what 's gotten into them over there , but if they let niggers into the school , then let them feed ' em over at Green Hill , we do n't got ta feed ' em here . " He looked pointedly at Tana , then at Sharon where she sat , and it was as though an enormous force had entered the room , and for a minute Tana thought he might physicallythrow them out . She had n't been as frightened or as angry since she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her graceful , long-legged , ladylike way , Sharon stood up . " Come on , Tan . " Her voice was a sexy purr , and for an instant , Tana saw the man 's eyes almost paw at her and she wanted to slap his face . It reminded her of something she never wanted to think of again , and a moment later she followedSharon out . " Son of a bitch . . . . " Tana was fuming as they walked slowly back to school , but Sharon was amazingly calm . It was the same feeling she had had the night before , with Tom , when they had n't let them into the movie house . For an instant , there had been a quiet surge of power , an understanding of why she was there , and then depression had set in . But tonight , rthe depression had n't hit her yet . " Life is strange , is n't it ? If this were in New York or L.A. , or almost anywhere else , no one would give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm black , you 're white . Maybe my mother is right . Maybe it is time for a crusade . I do n't know , I always thought that as long as I was comfortable , it did n't matter if things like that were happening to someone else . But all of a sudden that someone else is me . " Suddenly she knew why her mother had insisted on her coming here , and for the first time since she 'd arrived , she wondered if she 'd been right . Maybe she did belong here after all . Maybe she owed it to someone else for all the time that she had been comfortable . " I do n't know what to think , Tan .... " 64 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 65 " Neither do I. . . . " They were walking along side by side . " I do n't think I 've ever felt so helpless or been so mad .... " And then suddenly Billy Durning 's face came to mind , and she visibly winced , " Well . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had before . Tana almost wanted to put an arm around her to protect her from more hurt , as Sharon glanced over at her with a gentle smile . " When was that , Tan ? " " Oh a long time ago .... " She tried to smile , " . . . like five months .... " " Oh yeah . . . a real long time ago . . . . " The two girls exchanged a smile and walked on as a car sped by , but no one botheredthem , and Tana was n't afraid . No one would ever do to her again what Billy Durning did . She would kill them first . And there was a strange ugly look in her eyes as Sharon glanced at her . " Must 've been pretty bad . " " It was . " " Wan na talk about it ? " Her voice was as soft as the charcoal gray night , and they walked along in silence for a time as Tana thought . She had never wanted to tell anyone about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom . " I do n't know . " Sharon nodded , as though she understood . Everyone had something they did n't want to share . She had a secret like that herself . " It 's okay , Tan . " But as she said the words , Tana looked at her , and suddenly the words burst from her , almost of their own . " Yeah , I do . . . . " And then , " I do n't know . . . how do you talk about something like that ? " She began to walk faster as though to run away , and Sharon followed her easily on her long , graceful legs , unconsciously Tana ran- a hand through her hair nervously , looked away , and began to breathe harder than she had before . " There 's nothing much to say . . . . I went to a party after I graduatedin June . . . my mother 's boss 's house . . . he has this real little shit of a son . . . and I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her breath was coming in little short gasps and Sharon knew she was n't aware of it as they hurried along . She knew that whateverit was , it was torturing the girl , and it would be better if she got it out . " Anyway , she said I had to go anyway . . . she always says that . . . that 's the way she is , about Arthur Durning anyway , andhis kids . . . she 's blind to what they are , and . . . " the words stopped , and they walked on , hurrying , hurrying , as though she could still run away , and Sharon kept pace , watching her as she struggled with the memories and then began to speak again , " .. anyway , this dumb boy picked me up and we got there .. to the party , I mean . . . and everyone got drunk . . , and the dumb guy who brought me got drunk and disappeared and I was wandering around the house . . . and Billy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to see the room where my mother worked , and I knew where it was .... " There were tears running down her cheeks now , but she did n't feel them in the wind , and Sharon did n't say anything to her , " and he took me to Arthur 's bedroom instead and everything was gray . . . gray velvet , gray satin . . . gray fur ... even the rug on the floor was gray , " it was all she could remember , the endless field of gray and her blood on the floor afterwards and Billy 's face , and then the accident , she could barely breathe thinking of it , and she pulled at the neck of her shirt as she began to run , sobbing now , as Sharon followed her , keeping close , staying near . She was n't alone anymore , there was a friend running through the nightmare with her and it was as though she sensed that as she went on , " . . . and Billy started to slap me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ... " she remembered the helplessness again now , the desperation she felt , and suddenly in the night air she screamed and suddenly she stopped , burying her face in her hands , " . . . and I could n't do anything to make him stop . . . I could n't .... " Her whole body was shaking now as Sharon took her quietly in her arms and held her tight , " . . . and he raped me . . . and he left me there with blood all over me .. . my legs and my face . . . and then I threw up . . . and later he followed me all down the road and he Made me get in his car and he almost hit this truck , " the words just would n't stop now as she cried and Sharon began to cry with her , " and we hit a tree instead and he cut his head and there was blood all over him too and they took us to the hospital and then my mother came .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ravaged by the memory she had tried to flee for five months , she looked up into Sharon 's eyes , " and when I tried to tell her , she would n't believe anything I said .. . she said Billy Durning would n't do a thing like that . " The sobs were deep and wracking now , and quietly Sharon held her tight. 66 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 67 " I believe you , Tan . " Tana nodded , looking like a bereft little girl . " I never want anyone to touch me again . " She knew exactly how Tana felt , but not for the same reasons as her friend . She had n't been raped . She had gladly given it , to the boy she loved . " My mother never believed a single word I said . And she never will . The Durnings are gods to her . " " All that matters is that you 're okay , Tan . " Sharon led her to a tree stump , where they sat down and Sharon offered her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you are okay , you know . A lot more so than you think . " She smiled gently at her friend , deeply moved by her confidence and she wiped the tears from her cheeks as Tana smiled at her . " You do n't think I 'm awful because of that ? " " That 's a dumb thing to ask . It 's no reflection on you , Tan . " " I do n't know . . . sometimes I think it is . . . as though I could have stopped him if I tried hard enough . " It felt good just to say the words , just to get them out . They had haunted her for months . " Do you really believe that , Tan ? Do you really think you could have stopped him ? Tell the truth . " She thought about it for a long time and then shook her head . " No . " " Then do n't torture yourself . It happened . It was horrible . Worse than that . It was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your whole life , but no one will ever do that to you again . And it was n't really you he touched . He could n't touch the real you , no matter what , Tan . Just cut it off . Dump the memory . And move on . " That 's easy to say , " Tana smiled tiredly , " but not so easily done . How do you forget something like that ? " " You make yourself . You do n't let it destroy you , Tan . That 's the only time a guy like that wins . He 's sick . You 're not . Do n't make yourself sick over what he did . As awful as it was , put it out of your mind , and move on . " " Oh Sharon . . . " She sighed and stood up , looking down at her friend . It was a beautiful night . " What makes you so smart , for a kid ? " Sharon smiled , but her eyes were serious tonight , almost sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my secrets too . " " Like what ? " Tana felt calmer now than she ever had in her life , it was as though a raging animal had been released from her , as though Sharon had let it out of its cage and set it free , and Tana was finally at peace again . Her mother had n't been able to do that for her five months before , but this girl had , and she knew that whateverelse happened after that , they would always be friends . " What happened to you ? " Tana searched her eyes , knowing now that there was something there . And she was sure of it when Sharon looked up at her . She did n't mince any words . She had never told anyone , but she had thought about it a lot , and she and her father had talked about it one night before she left for Green Hill . He had told her the same thing she had just told Tana , that she could n't let it destroy her life . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to let it stay that way , and move on , but she wondered if she ever could . " I had a baby this year . " For an instant Tana 's breath caught and she looked at Sharon in shock . " You did ? " " Yeah . I 've been going with the same boy at home since I was fifteen and when I was sixteen he gave me his senior ring . . . I do n't know , Tan . . . it kind of seemed so cute . . . he looks like an African God , and he 's smart as hell , and he dances . . . " she looked pretty and young as she thought of him .... " He 's at Harvardnow , " her eyes grew sad , " but I have n't talked to him in almost a year . I got pregnant , I told him , and he panicked , I guess . He wanted me to have an abortion from this doctor his cousin knew , and I refused . . . hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes filled with tears at the memory , and she forgot that Tana was standing there , looking down at her . " I was going to tell my mom , but . . . I just could n't . . . I told my father instead . . . and then he told her . . . and everybody went nuts . . . and they called his parents , and everyone cried and screamed , my mother called him a nigger . . . and his father called me a slut . . . it was the worst night in my life , and when it was all over , my parents gave me a choice . I could have an abortion at a doctor 's my mother had found out about , or I could have the baby and give it up . They said , " she took a deep gulp of air as though this were the worst part , " that I68 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 69could n't keep it . . . that it would ruin my life . . . , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seventeen . . . and I do n't know why but I decided to have the baby , I think because I thought that Danny would change his mind . . . or my parents would . . . or a miracle would happen . . . but nothing did . I lived in a home for five months and I kept up with all the work for my senior year , and the baby was born on April nineteenth . . . a little boy .... " She was trembling and Tana wordlessly reached out and took her hand , " I was n't supposed to see him at all . . . but I did once . . . he was so little . . . . I was in labor for nineteen hours and it was horrible and he only weighed six pounds . . . . " Her eyes were a thousand miles away thinking of the little boy she would never see again , and she looked up at Tana now , " He 's gone , Tan , " she whimpered almost like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They both were . " I signed the final papers three weeks ago . My mother drew them up . . . some people adopted him in New York .... " She could n't stop the sobs as she bent her head , " Oh God , Tan , I hope they 're good to him . . . I never should have let him go . . . and all for what ? " She looked angrily up at her friend , " for this ? To come to this dumb school to prove a point , so that other colored girls can come here one day . So what ? " " That had nothing to do with this . They wanted you to have a fresh start , with a husband and a family at the right time . " " They were wrong , and so was I. You 'll never know what it felt like . . . that emptiness when I went home . . . with nothing ... with no one . . . nothing will ever replace that . " She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I went into the home in Maryland . . . and I 'll never know where the baby is . . . . I graduatedwith my class . . . , " with a lead weight in her heart , " . . . and no one knew what I felt .... " Tana shook her head , watching her . They were both women now . It had been hard earned , hard won , and it was too soon to know if things would get better in time , but one thing they both knew as they walked slowly home , and that was that they each had a friend . Tana pulled Sharon off the stump , and they hugged each other tight , their tears fell on each other 's cheeks , each feeling the other 's pain , as much as they could . " I love you , Shar . " Tana looked at her with her gentle smile , and Sharon dried her eyes . " Yeah . . . me too ... . And they walked home arm in arm , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got undressed and into their beds , each with her own thoughts . " Tan ? " It was Sharon 's voice in the dark room . " Yeah ? " " Thanks .

" Did he have any suggestions about how to pull that off ? " Sharon laughed at that . " I 'll have to ask him that . " And then suddenly , she had an idea . " Why do n't you ask him yourself ? Why do n't you come home for Thanksgiving with me ? " Tana mulled it over from her bed , with the beginnings of a smile . She liked the idea . " I do n't know what my mother will say . " But all of a sudden she was n't sure she cared , and if she did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months before . Maybe it was time to try her wings and do what she wanted to do . " I 'll call her tomorrow night . " " Good . " Sharon smiled sleepily and turned over in her bed , with her back to her friend . " G'night , Tan .... " And a moment later , they were both asleep , more at ease than either of them had been in months , Tana 's hands cast childlike above the blond hair , and Sharon cuddled up into a little black purring ball . Even the long legs seemed to disappear and she looked like a kitten as she slept peacefully . FULL CIRCLE 71ChaptersJean Roberts was disappointed when her daughter called to say that she had decided not to come home for Thanksgiving . " Are you sure ? " She did n't want to insist , but she would have preferred it if Tana were coming back . " You do n't know this girl very well .. . . " Mother , I live with her . We share the same room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . " " Are you sure her parents wo n't mind ? " " Positive . She called them this afternoon . They have a room for me , and she said they were delighted that she was bringing someonehome . " Of course they were . From what Sharon had said , it proved Miriam 's point that Sharon could be happy at Green Hill , even if she was the only black girl there , and now she was bringing one of " them " home , the ultimate proof of how well they had accepted her . They did n't know that Tana was her only friend , that there was n't a single place in Yolan where she could be served , that she had n't been able to go to a movie since she 'd arrived , and that even in the cafeteria at school , the girls avoided her . But , according to Sharon , even if they had known , Miriam would have felt it proved even more that Sharon was needed there . " They " had to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a good challenge for Sharon , particularly after last year , this would keep her from dwelling on herself , Miriam Blake thought , it would give her something else to think about , or so she had said . " Really , they said it was fine . " " All right , then be sure you invite her up sometime during theChristmas holidays , " Jean smiled into the phone , " in fact , I have a little surprise for you . Arthur and I were going to tell you over Thanksgiving . . . " Tana 's heart stopped . Was he finally marrying her ? She was robbed of speech as her mother went on . " Arthur made it possible for you to have a little coming out ' party of your own . There 's a small cotillion here in town . . . well , not a cotillion really , but a deb party of sorts , and Arthur put up your name , 1 mean you did go to Miss Lawson 's after all , dear , and . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that wonderful ? " For a moment , no words came to Tana 's mind . It did n't seem particularly wonderful at all , and once again her mother would be kissing ArthurDurning 's feet . . . marry her . . . what a joke . How could she have thought a thing like that . . . a " cotillion of sorts " .. . shit .... " Why do n't you invite your new friend to come up then ? " Tana almost choked . Because my new friend is black , Mom . " I 'll ask , but I think she 's going away over the holidays . " Shit . A debutante . And who would her escort be ? Billy Durning ? The son of a bitch . " You do n't sound very excited , sweetheart . " There was disappointment in Jean Roberts ' voice , both because Tana would n't be coming home , and because she did n't sound very excited about the party Arthur had arranged . He knew how much it meant to Jean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , of course , though not at a small deb party like this , but nonetheless it would be a wonderful experience for Tana to have , or at least Jean thought it would . " I 'm sorry , Mom . I guess I 'm just surprised . " " It is a beautiful surprise , is n't it ? " No . She did n't really care . Things like that did n't matter to her . They never had . All the social nonsense of the Durnings ' world seemed irrelevant to her , but it meant so much to Jean . It always had , ever since she had fallen in love with him . " You 'll have to think of an escort for the dance . I was hoping Billy could , " Tana felt her heart pound and her chest get tight , " but he 's going skiing in Europe with friends . In Saint Moritz , the lucky boy , " . . . lucky boy . . . He raped me , Mom ... . " You 'll just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " Of course . How many other rapists do we know ? " It 's too bad I ca n't go alone . " Tana 's voice sounded dead at her end of the phone. 72 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 73 " That 's a ridiculous thing to say . " Jean sounded annoyed . " Well , anyway , do n't forget to invite your friend . . . the one you 're goinghome for Thanksgiving with . " " Sure . " Tana smiled . If she only knew . Jean Roberts would have died if Tana had invited a black friend to the little " coming out " party Arthur had arranged . It almost amused Tana to think of it , but she would never have taken advantage of Sharon like that . They were all a bunch of rude pricks . She knew that even her mother was n't ready for that . " What 'll you do for Thanksgiving , Mom ? Will you be all right ? " " I 'll be fine . Arthur had already invited us to Greenwich for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be there , you can spend the night . " There was a dead silence on the phone , and Tana regretted the words . " I did n't mean it like that . " " Yes , you did . " " Well , what difference does it make ? I 'm eighteen years old now . It 's not a secret .... " Tana felt sick as she thought of the endless gray room where . . . " I 'm sorry , Mom . " " Take care of yourself . " She drew herself up . She would miss seeing her , but she had a lot to do now , and Tana would be home in a month anyway . " And do n't forget to thank your friend for having you there . " Tana smiled to herself , it was like being seven years old again . Maybe it always would be . " I will . Have a good Thanksgiving , Mom . " " I shall . And I 'll thank Arthur for you . " Jean said the words pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " The ball , Tana , the ball . . . I do n't know if you realize it yet , but something like that is very important for a young girl , and it 's not something that I could provide f o r you myself . " Important . . . ? Important to whom ... ? " You have no idea what something like this means . " Tears stung Jean Roberts ' eyes . In some ways , it was a dream come true . Andy and Jean Roberts ' little girl , the baby Andy had never seen , would be coming out in New York society , and even if it was on the fringe , it was an important event for both of them . . . for Tana . . . and especially for Jean ... it would be the most important moment in her life . She rememberedAnn 's coming out ball . She had planned every exquisite detail and had never thought that one day Tana would be coming out too . " I 'm sorry , Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you ought to write Arthur a nice note . Tell him what it means to you . " She wanted to scream into the phone . What the hell does it mean ? That she 'd find a rich husband some day , that they could mark it on her pedigree ? Who cared ? What accomplishment was that , to curtsy at a dumb ball , being gaped at by a lot of drunks ? She did n't even know who she was going to take with her , and she shuddered at the thought . She had gone out with half a dozen different boys during her last two years of school , but there had never been anyone serious , and after what had happened in Greenwich in June , there was no one she wanted to go out with at all . " I have to go , Mom . " She was suddenly desperate to get off the phone , and when she returned to her room , she looked depressed and Sharon looked up . She was doing her nails again . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had both tried beige , " Straw Hat " by Faberge . " She said no ? " " She said yes . " " So ? You look like someone just burst your balloon . " " I think she did . " Tana sat down on her bed with a thump . " Shit . She got her damn friend to sign me up for some dumb coming out ball . Jesus Christ , Shar , I feel like a complete fool . " Sharon looked up at her and started to laugh . " You mean you 're going to be a debutante , Tan ? " " More or less . " Tana looked embarrassed and groaned at her friend . " How could she do that to me ? " " It might be fun . " " For who ? And what the hell 's the point ? It 's like a big cattle drive . They shove you around in a white dress and show you off to a lot of drunks , and you 're supposed to find a husband somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , and Sharon put her nail polish away . " Who 're you going to take ? " " Do n't ask . She wanted Billy Durning to be my escort of course , and thank God he 'll be out of town . " " Be grateful for that . " Sharon looked pointedly at her. 74 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 75 , " I am . But the whole thing sounds like a farce . " " So are a lot of things in life . " " Do n't be so cynical , Shar . " " Do n't be so chicken , Tan . It 'll do you good . " " Says who ? " " Says I. " Sharon advanced towards her and tried to stare her down . " You live like a nun around here . " " So do you . So what ? " " I do n't have any choice . " Tom had never called her again , it was more than he could cope with , Sharon knew , and in truth she understood . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her life very interesting at Green Hill . " You do . " " Never mind . " " You 've got to start going out . " " No , I do n't . " Tana looked her right in the eye . " I do n't have to do a goddamn thing I do n't want to do . I 'm eighteen years old , and I 'm free as a bird . " " A lame duck . " Sharon stared her down . " Get out there again , Tan . " But Tana said nothing at all . She walked into the bathroom they shared with the next room , locked the door , ran a bath , and did n't come out for an hour . " I meant what I said . " Sharon 's voice was husky in the darkened room , once they were both in their beds . " About what ? " " You should start going out again . " " So should you . " " I will one of these days . " Sharon sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no one for me to go out with here . " And then she laughed . " Hell , Tan , I do n't know what I 'm complaining about . At least I 've got you . " Tana smiled at her and they chatted for a few minutes and then drifted off to sleep . The following week Tana went home to Washington with her . They were met at the train by Sharon 's father , Freeman Blake , and Tana was instantly struck by how tall and handsome he was . He was a regal looking man , with a proud , beautifully carved , almost mahoganyface , broad shoulders , and Sharon 's same endlessly long legs . He had a warm smile , brilliantly white teeth , and he was quick to pull his daughter into his arms and hold her tight . He knew just how much she 'd been through in the last year , and she 'd comethrough it like a champ , just as he 'd known she would , and he was desperately proud of her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled her eyes , and turned quickly towards her friend . " Tana , this is my dad , Freeman Blake . Daddy , this is Tana Roberts , my roommate at Green Hill . " He gave Tana 's hand a powerful shake and she was magnetized by his eyes and the sound of his voice on the way home . He was filling Sharon in on all the local news , her mother 's appointment to an even more important post , her brother Dick 's big new romance , the remodeling of the house , the neighbor 's new child , his new book . It was a warm friendly patter that touched Tana 's heart , and she felt envious of the life that Sharon obviously had . And she felt it even more at dinner that night in the handsome colonial dining room . They had a beautifulhouse with a huge lawn and backyard , three cars in the garage , one of which was a Cadillac Freeman drove , despite the rude things his friends said . But he admitted that he had always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years . They were obviously all four closely knit , and Tana found Miriam more than a little formidable . She was so intelligent and so direct that it took one 's breath away , and she seemed to constantly expect the ultimate of everyone . One was never safe from her questions , her demands , and her ever-searching gaze . " See what I mean ? " Sharon said when they were alone upstairs . " It 's like being on the witness stand , just having dinner with her . " She had wanted to know everything Sharon had done in the last two months , and she was interested in both the incident with Tom at the movie house , and the one at the coffee shop with Tana after that . " It 's just that she cares so much , Shar . . . about everything ! " " I know that . And it drives me nuts . Daddy is just as smart as she is for chrissake , and he 's so much gentler about everything . " He was that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a way of making everyone comfortable , of bringing them closer togetherand forming an irresistible bond . Tana had noticed it all night long and she thought him the most remarkable man she had ever met . " He 's the most incredible man , Shar . " " I know . " " I read one of his books last year . I 'm going to go home now and read them all . " " I 'll give them to you . " " Only if I can have an autographed set . " They both laughed , and a moment later , Miriam knocked at the door , anxious to know that they were all right . " Do you have everything you need ? " Tana smiled almost shyly at her . " I do . Thank you very much , Mrs. Blake . " " Not at all . We 're so glad you could come . " The smile was even more dazzling than Shar 's , and the eyes were driving , omniscient , almost frightening they plunged so deep and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do . Very much . The professors are pretty interesting . " But there was a lack of enthusiasm in her voice which Miriam picked up at once . " But ? " Tana smiled . She was sharp . Very sharp . " The atmosphere is n't as warm as I thought it would be . " " Why is that ? " " I do n't know . The girls seem to stay in cliques . " " And the two of you ? " " We 're together most of the time . " Sharon looked at Tana and smiled , and Miriam did n't seem displeased . She thought that Tana was a bright girl , and there was a lot of potential there . Far more than Tana herself knew . She was quick , she was bright , she was funny at times , but cautious , laced up . She would have to open up one day , and when she did , God only knew what would be there . " Maybe that 's your problem then , girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Hill ? " " Just Shar . We 're in class together most of the time . We share the same room . " " And you 're probably being punished for that . I 'm sure you realize that . If your closest friend is the only Negro girl there they 're going to penalize you , you know . " " What for ? " " Do n't be naive . " " Do n't be so cynical , Mom . " Sharon sounded suddenly an- noyed . " Maybe it 's time you both grew up . " " What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? " Sharon lashed out at her . " Hell , I 've been home for nine hours and you 're already on my back with your speeches and your crusades . " " I 'm not making any speeches . I 'm just telling you to face facts . " She looked at them both then . " You ca n't hide from the truth , girls . It is n't easy being black today . . . or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both going to have to realize that and be willing to pay the price if you expect the friendship to last . " " Ca n't you do anything without turning it into a political crusade , Mom ? " Miriam looked at her and then at her friend . " I want you to do something for me , both of you , before you go back to school on Sunday night . There 's a man I know speaking this Sunday in Washington . He 's one of the most extraordinary men I 've ever known , Martin Luther King , and I want you to come listen to him with me . " " Why ? " Sharon was still glaring at her . " Because it 's something neither of you will ever forget . " And as they rode back toward South Carolina late that night , Tana was still thinking of it . Miriam Blake had been right . He was the most visionary man Tana had ever listened to . He made everyone else seem stupid and blind , and it was hours before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words about being black and being a black man 's friend , about civil rights and the equality of everyone , and afterwards they had sung a song , swaying together , arms crossed , holding hands . She looked at Sharon an hour after they left Washington . " He was amazing , was n't he ? " Sharon nodded , thinking of his words again . " You know , it feels dumb just going back to school . I feel as though I should be doing something . " She leaned her head back against the seat and closed her eyes , and Tana stared out into the dark night as they rode into the South . It seemed to make his words even more important than they had been . This was where it was happening , where people were being hurt , and ignored , and abused . And as the thoughts wandered through her head , she thought of the debutante party her mother had set up , and it was as though the two thoughts were so diametrically opposed that they just would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Sharon opened her eyes again , Tana was looking at her . " What are you going to do ? " One had to do something after hearing him . There was no choice at all . Even Freeman Blake had agreed . " I do n't know yet . " Sharon looked tired , but she had been thinking of it since they 'd left Washington , of what she could do to help . . . in Yolan . . . in Green Hill . . . " What about you ? " " I do n't know . " Tana sighed . " Anything I can , I guess . But I 'll tell you , after hearing Dr. King speak , I know one thing . . . that party my mother is forcing me into in New York is the dumbest thing I 've ever done . " Sharon smiled . She could n't really disagree now , but there was another side to it as well . A more small-scale , human one . " It 'll do you good . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rode on into the South until they reached Yolan , and took one of the town 's two cabs to Green Hill . Ghapter 6The train roared into Pennsylvania Stationon December twenty-first just after two o'clock in the afternoon and there was a light snow falling as Tana watched . It made everything look Christmasy and almost like a fairy tale , and yet as she gathered her things , fought her way through the station , and went outside to hail a cab , she realized again how depressed she was about coming home . It made her feel instantly guilty toward jean , and she knew that she was n't being fair , but she would rather have been anywhere than on her way home to her own coming out dance . And she knew how excited her mother was . For the past two weeks , she had called Tana almost every night , about the guests , the flowers , the table decor , her date , her dress . She had picked the dress out for Tana herself , an exquisite white silk with white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns around the hem . It had cost a fortune , and Arthur had told her to charge it to his account at Saks . " He 's so good to us , sweetheart .... " As she rode home to the apartment in the cab , Tana could close her eyes and imagine her mother 's face as she said the words . . . why , why was she so everlastingly grateful to him ? What on earth did he do for her , except let her work her fingers to the bone , and wait for him all those times he never came when Marie was still alive . . . and even now , everything else always seemed to come first with him . And if he loved Jean so much , why the hell did n't he marry her ? It depressed Tana to think about that too . Everything was such a goddamn farce . . . her mother and Arthur , how " good " the Durnings were to them , yeah , like the way Billy had been good to80 DANIELLE STEEL FULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to the following night . She had invited a boy she had known for years and never liked , but he was the right type for an event like that , Chandler George III . She had gone to a couple of dances with him before , and he bored her to tears , but she knew her mother would be pleased . And she also knew that she 'd have a miserable time but that could n't be helped . Most important of all , he was harmless and polite and would n't do anything inappropriate . The apartment was dark when she got in , Jean was still at work as Tana looked around . Everything looked the same except smaller somehow , and drearier than she had remembered it . And as she had the thought , it seemed somehow unfair . She knew how hard her mother tried to keep a nice home for them both , and she always had . But Tana felt as though things were different now , as though imperceptibly she had changed and no longer fit in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Washington , and how much she had enjoyed being there . It was n't pretentious , like the Durnings ' house , but it was warm , and beautiful , and real . And she missed the Blakes as well , especially Sharon . Tana had watched her get off the train , feeling as though she were losing her best friend , and Sharon had turned back once to give her a big smile and a wave , and then she was gone and the train moved north , and now she was here , feeling as though she wanted to cry as she set her bags down in her room . " Is that my little girl ? " The front door slammed and Jean 's voice rang out as Tana turned with a frightened look . What if her mother could read her thoughts , could see how uncomfortable she was just being there ? But Jean saw nothing of the sort , all she saw was the daughter she loved , and she held her tight for an instant before stepping back again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean . Her cheeks were pink from the cold , there were kisses of frost on the tips of her hair , and her eyes looked big and dark . She was so excited that she did n't even wait to take off her coat before running into her own room and emerging again with Tana 's dress . It was exquisite as it hung from the padded satin hanger they had deliveredit with . It looked almost like a wedding dress , and Tana smiled . " Where 's the veil ? " Her mother smiled back . " You never know . That 'll come next . " Tana laughed and shook her head at the thought . " Now let 's not rush into that . I 'm only eighteen . " " That does n't mean anything , sweetheart . You might meet the man of your dreams tomorrow night , you know . And who knows after that ? " Tana stared at her in disbelief . Something in Jean 's eyes said she was serious . " Do you mean that , Mom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tana again , and now that she saw the dress next to her , she knew just how fabulous it was going to look on . A victory all around . " You 're a beautiful girl , Tana . And some man is going to be very lucky to have you as his wife . " " But would n't you be upset if I met him now ? " " Why ? " She did n't seem to understand and Tana looked stunned . " But I 'm eighteen years old . Do n't you want me to go on with college and make something of myself ? " " You 're doing that now . " " But this is just the beginning , Mom . When I finish my two years at Green Hill , I want to go on and do something else . " Jean frowned . " There 's nothing wrong with getting married and having kids . " " Is that what this is all about ? " Suddenly Tana felt sick . " This coming out bullshit . . . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jean Roberts looked shocked . " Tana , that 's a terrible thing to say . " Well , it 's true , is n't it ? All these young girls lined up , curtsying like fools , and a bunch of men checking them out . " She squinted her eyes as though the girls were lined up in front of her , " . . . let 's see , I 'll take . . . that one over there . " Her eyes opened wide again , and she looked upset . " Hell , there has to be more to life than that . " " You make it sound sick somehow , and it 's not . It 's a beautiful tradition that means a lot to everyone . " No , it does n't , Mom , at least not to me . . . just to you . . . but she could n't bring herself to say those words . Jean looked at her unhappily . " Why are you being so difficult about this ? Ann Durning came out four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good for her . But I 'm not Ann . " She had also run off with some twit in Italy who had to be bought off , as Tana recalled. 82 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 83Jean sighed and sat down , looking up at Tana from the chair . She had n't seen Tana in three months and she could already feel the tension mounting between them . " Why do n't you just relax and enjoy yourself , Tana ? You never know , you might meet someone you like . " " I do n't want to meet someone I like . ' I do n't even want to go , Mom . " Tears filled Jean 's eyes as she looked at her , and Tana could n't stand the look on her face . " I just wanted you to . . . I wanted you to have . . . " Tana knelt and hugged her close . " I 'm sorry , Mom . I 'm sorry . . . I know it 'll be beautiful . " Jean smiled through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for sure , you will be beautiful , sweetheart . " " I 'd have to be in that dress . You must have spent a fortune on it . " She was touched but it seemed such a useless expense . She would have rather had clothes to wear at school . She was borrowing Sharon 's all the time . But Jean was smiling at her . " It 's a gift from Arthur , sweetheart . " Tana felt her stomach tie in a knot . Another reason to be " grateful " to him . She was so tired of Arthur and his gifts . " He should n't have done that . " Tana was visibly less than thrilled , and Jean could n't understand why except that Tana had always been jealous of him . " He wanted you to have a pretty dress . " And indeed it was . As she stood in front of the mirror the following night , her hair teased and swept up , the way her mother had seen Jackie Kennedy 's hair done in Vogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy princess with her spun gold hair and big green eyes . It filled Jean 's eyes with tears just to look at her . She looked exquisite . Moments later , Chandler George arrived to pick her up , and Jean left with them . Arthur had said that he would try to come by , but he was n't sure . There was a dinner he had to attend that night , and he 'd do his " best . " Tana did n't say anything about it to Jean in the cab , but she had heard that line before , and knew that it meant nothing at all . It had applied to Christmas , Thanksgiving , and Jean 's birthdays over the years . And usually doing his " best " meant that he would n't arrive , but a bunch of flowers , or a telegram , or a note would instead . She always remembered her mother 's crestfallen face at those times , but not tonight . Jean was too excited about her to worryabout Arthur very much . She hovered like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one side of a long bar . The fathers had found each other , too , and there were clumps of well wishers and old family friends , but most of the room was filled with young people about Tana 's own age , girls in pink dresses , or red satin , or bright green , and only a dozen in the white dresses their parents had bought them to come out in that night . For the most part , they were a motley adolescent herd , with faces that would take years to thin out , and waistlines to match . There was something singularly undistinguished about girls that age , and because of that , Tana especially stood out . She was tall and slim , and she held her head high . Jean watched her proudly from across the room . When the big moment came , and the drumroll came halfway into the night , and each girl was led out on her father 's arm to curtsy to the guests , there were unrestrained tears of pride on Jean 's cheeks . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had even dared to hope that he might lead her out . But he could n't make it , of course . He had done enough for them , she could n't expect him to do more . Tana came out looking nervous and flushed on the arm of Chandler George . She curtsied prettily , lowered her eyes , and disappeared into the rest of the group , and the music began again shortly after that . It had happened , it was done . Tana had officially " come out . " She looked around the room afterwards , feeling like a complete fool . There was no exhilaration , no thrill , no romantic tingle up and down her spine . She had done it because her mother wanted her to and it was over now . She was grateful for the hubbub that happened afterwards , which allowed her to get lost for a while . Chandler looked as though he had fallen madly in love with a chubby redheaded girl with a sweet smile and an elaborate white velvet dress , and Tana had discreetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize , as Tana wandered into an alcove and collapsed in a chair . She lay her head back , closed her eyes , and sighed , grateful to be away from it all , from the music , the people , Chandler , whom she could n't stand , and the desperately lonely look of pride in her mother 's eyes . Tana sighed again just thinking of it , and then jumped halfway off her seat as she heard a voice . " It ca n't be as bad as all that . " She opened her eyes to see a powerfully built dark-haired young man with eyes as green as hers. 84 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 85There was something rakish about him , even in black tie , a casual air about the way he stood , looking down at her , holding a glass , and smiling cynically at her , as a piece of dark hair fell over one emerald eye . " Bored , lovely one ? " He managed to look both sarcastic and amused and Tana nodded her head tentatively in embarrassment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked into his eyes and smiled . She had the feeling that she 'd seen him somewhere , but could n't imagine where . " What can I say ? It 's a drag . " " It certainly is . The cattle show . I make the rounds every year . " But he did n't look as though he 'd been doing it for long . Despite the air of sophistication , he did n't look very old . " How long have you been doing this ? " He grinned boyishly . " This is my second year . Actually , this should be my first , but they invited me to the Cotillion by mistake last year . And all the rest of the coming out balls , so I went . " He rolled his eyes with a grin , " What a pain in the ass . " And then he looked appraisingly at her , and took a sip of his scotch . " And how did you find your way here ? " " By cab . " She smiled sweetly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The sarcasm dripped from his words again and she laughed . " Engaged to him yet ? " " No , thanks . " " That shows at least minimal good judgment on your part . " He spoke in a lazy , laconic way , with the accent of the upper crust , and yet he seemed to be laughing at it all , and Tana was amused by him . There was something outrageous about the boy , as proper as he was , as well dressed . But at the same time there was a shocking irreverencewhich showed through and suited her mood perfectly . " Do you know Chandler , then ? " The young man smiled again . " We went to the same boarding school for two years . He plays a great game of squash , stinks at bridge , handles himself pretty well on the tennis court , flunked math , history , and biology , and has absolutely nothing between his ears . " Tana laughed in spite of herself . She did n't like him anyway , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " That sounds about right . Not nice , but right . " " They do n't pay me to be nice . " He looked mischievous as hesipped his drink again , and made an obvious appraisal of her cleavageand small waist . " Do they pay you to do anything ? " " Not yet , actually . " He smiled benevolently at her . " And with luck they never will . " " Where do you go to school ? " He frowned , as though he had just forgotten something somewhere , and then gazed blankly at her . " Do you know . . . I ca n't seem to remember . " He smiled again as she wondered what that meant . Maybe he was n't going to college at all , although he did n't look that type either . " What about you ? " " Green Hill . " The impish smile appeared again , with one eyebrow raised . " How ladylike . Majoring in what ? Southern plantations , or pouring tea ? " " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least I go to school . " " For two years anyway . Then what , princess ? Or is that what tonight is all about ? The Great Hunt for Husband Number One . " He pretended to speak into a megaphone . " Will all candidates line up against the far wall . All healthy young white males with pedigrees. . . have your fathers ' D &B's; in hand , we will also want to know your schools , blood type , whether or not you drive , how large your personal trust is and how soon you come into it . . . " He went on as she laughed at him , and he lowered his voice . " Seen any likely ones so far , or are you too madly in love with Chandler George ? " " Much . " She began to walk slowly towards the main ballroom and he followed her , just in time to see her escort kissing the chubby redhead on the other side of the room . The tall dark handsome young man turned to Tana somberly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're about to be jilted , prin-cess . " She shrugged and met the green eyes so like her own . " Them 's the breaks , I guess . " There was laughter in her eyes . She did n't give a damn about Chandler George . " Would you like to dance ? " " Sure . " He whirled her around the floor expertly . There was something very dashing and worldly about this boy which seemed to belie his youth . One had the feeling that he had been around , although Tana86 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 87did n't know where , or even who he was , a circumstance he remediedat the end of the first dance . " By the way , what 's your name , princess ? " " Tana Roberts . " " My name 's Harry . " He looked at her with the boyish grin and she smiled , and then unexpectedly he swept her a low bow . " HarrisonWinslow the Fourth , actually . But Harry will do . " " Should I be impressed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of letting him know . " Only if you read the social columns regularly . Harrison Winslowthe Third usually makes an ass of himself , in cities that circle the globe . . . Paris and London most of the time , Rome when he has time . . . Gstaad , Saint Moritz . . . Munich , Berlin . And New York when he has absolutely no choice , and needs to fight with the trustees my grandmother left in charge of her very handsome estate . But he is n't very fond of the States , or of me , come to think of it . " He spoke in a flat monotone as Tana watched , wondering what was going on inside of him , but there was no clue as yet . " My mother died when I was four . I do n't remember her at all , except once in a while , something comes back in a wave . . . like a perfume . . . or a sound , her laughter on the stairs when they went out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's probably impossible . She committed suicide . Highly unstable , ' as my grandmother used to say , but a pretty piece . ' And poor Dad 's been licking his wounds ever since . . . I forgot to mention Monaco and Cap d'Antibes . He licks his wounds there too . With helpmates , of course . There 's a regular one he parks in London for most of the year , a very pretty one in Paris . . . one with whom he likes to ski . . . a Chinese girl in Hong Kong . He used to take me along when I was n't in school , but eventually I got too disagreeable , so he stopped . That , and . . . " the eyes grew vague , " . . . other things . Anyway , " his eyes came back into focus and he smiled cynically at Tana again , " that 's who Harrison Winslow is , or at least one of them . " " And you ? " Her voice was soft and his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intended to . But it was also his fourth scotch , and although it had n't hurt his feet when they danced , it had loosened his tongue , not that he cared . Everyone in New York knew who Harry Winslow was , both father and son . " Are you like him ? " She doubted it . For one thing , he had n't had time to develop all those skills . He could n't have been much older than she , after all . He shrugged carelessly . " I 'm working on it . " And then he smiled again . " Beware , lovely one ! Beware ! " And with that , he swept her into his arms and onto the dance floor again , and she saw her mother watching them . She watched them for a long time , and then inquired of someone who he was , and she did n't look displeased . " Do you see your father very much ? " She was still thinking of what he had said as he whirled her around the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarding schools . . . his mother dead by suicide when he was four . . . the father halfway around the world most of the time , and obviously a libertine . " Actually , no . He does n't have time . " For just a minute , he sounded like a very young boy , and she was sorry for him , but he was quick to turn the tables on her . " What about you ? What 's your story , Tana Roberts , other than the fact that you have deplorable taste in men ? " He glanced in the direction of Chandler George crushing the little redhead to him , and they both laughed . " I 'm single , eighteen years old , and I go to Green Hill . " " Jesus . How dull . What else ? Any major loves ? " Her face slammed shut , and he noticed it . " No . " " Relax . I meant other than Chandler , of course . " She relaxed a little again . " Although admittedly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both being rotten to him , but he was the dullest boy she had ever known , and he was an easy target for the scorn of his peers . " Let 's see , what else ? Parents ? Illegitimate children ? Dogs ? Friends ? Hobbies ? Wait , " he patted his pockets , as though he had misplaced something . " I should have a form here somewhere . . . " They both laughed . " All of the above . . . ? none of the above ?  --  " One mother , no dogs , no illegitimate kids . " He looked sad . " I 'm disappointed in you . I thought you would have done better than that . " The music was winding down and Harry looked around . " What a bunch of bores . Want to go somewherefor a hamburger or a drink ? " She smiled . " I 'd like that , but do we take Chandler along ? " She laughed and Harry bowed. 88 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 89 " Leave that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . " Oh , God , what did you do ? " " I told him you were upset about the way he 's behaved all night with that redheaded tart , and I 'm dropping you off at your psychia- trist 's ... . " " You did n't ! " " I did . " He feigned innocence and then laughed . " Actually , I just told him that you 'd seen the light and preferred me . He con- gratulated you on your good taste , and ran off with his chubby little friend . " But whatever Harry had said , Chandler was waving hap- pily at them and leaving with the other debutante , so there was obviously no harm done . " I have to say something to my mother before we go . Do you mind ? " " Not at all . Well , actually , I do , but I guess I do n't have much choice . " But he behaved himself when Tana introduced him to Jean , and he looked very proper , much to her delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home alone , wishing Arthur had been there to see it all . It had been a beautiful evening , and it was obvious that Tana had had a wonderful time . And she was leaving now with Harry Winslow IV . Jean knew who he was , or at least she knew the name . " What about your old man ? " He stretched his legs out in the cab , after giving the driver the address of " 21 . " It was the hangout of his choice when he was in town , and Tana had been impressed . It was certainly a lot more fun than going out with Chandler George . And it was so long since she 'd been out on a date , she 'd forgotten how it felt , and her dates had never been like this . Usually , they all went out for pizza in a group on Second Avenue . And that had been before graduation . . . before Billy Durning .... " My father died before I was born , in the war . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench that way , than if they stick around for a few years . " It made Tana wonder why his mother had committed suicide , but she would never have dared to ask . " Did your mother remarry ? " " No , " Tana shook her head hesitantly , and then , " She has a friend . " He was the sort of person you told things like that to . There was something about his eyes . Something that made you trust him and like him all at once . He raised the mischievous eyebrow again . " Is her friend married ? " He was receptive too . She blushed beet red but he could n't see . " What made you say that ? " " Just smart , I guess . " He was so impossible , one would have wanted to slap his face if he were n't so boyish and so appealing all at once . And he was so openly impudent that it somehow made it all right . " Was I right ? " Normally , she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , or at least he was for a long time . He 's been a widower now for four years , and he still has n't married her . He 's a real selfish son of a bitch . " It was the strongest thing she had ever said about him publicly , even to Sharon at school . But Harry did n't look perturbed . " Most men are . You should meet my old man . He leaves them bleeding by the side of the road at least four times a week , just to keep his hand in . " " Sounds nice . " " He 's not . " Harry 's eyes were hard . " He 's only interested in one thing . Himself . It 's no wonder she killed herself . " He had never forgiven his father for that , and Tana 's heart suddenly ached for him , as the cab pulled up in front of " 21 , " and Harry paid and they stepped out . And a moment later , they were swept up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there once or twice , like on graduation night , and she loved the toys hanging over the bar , the well-dressed people crowded in , there were even two movie stars she recognized at once , and the headwaiter pounced on Harry with glee , obviously ecstatic to see him again . It was clearly his favorite haunt and he went there all the time . They stayed at the bar for a while , and then went to their table , where Harry ordered steak tartare for himself , and Tana ordered eggs Benedict , but as they sipped the Louis Roederer champagne he had ordered for them , Harry saw her face go taut . She was looking across the room at a table of people who seemed to be having a good time and there was an older man with his arm around a fairly young girl . Harry watched her face , and then her eyes and a moment later he patted her hand . " Let me guess . . . an old love ? " He was surprised to see that she went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 91 " Not mine , anyway . " And then he instantly knew . " Your mother 's friend ? " " He told her he had a business dinner tonight . " " Maybe it is . " " It does n't look like it to me . " Her eyes were hard as she turned to Harry again . " What irritates me more than anything is that he can do no wrong in her eyes . She always makes excuses for him . She sits and she waits and she 's so goddamn grateful to him . " " How long have they been together ? " " Twelve years . " He winced . " Jesus , that 's a long time . " " Yeah . " Tana glanced malevolently in Arthur 's direction again . " And it does n't seem to be cramping his style . " Seeing him made her think of Billy again , and she turned her head as though to avoid the thought , but Harry saw the sudden look of pain in her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His voice was gentle in her ears and she turned to look at him . " It 's her life , not mine . " " That 's right . Do n't forget that . You can make your own choices with your life . " He smiled , " and that reminds me , you never an- swered all my rude questions before . What are you going to do after Green Hill ? " " God knows . Maybe Columbia . I 'm not sure . I want to go on . " " Not get married and have four little kids ? " They both laughed . " Not for a while , thanks , although it 's my mother 's fondest dream . " And then she turned to him with a curious look . " And what about you , where do you go to school ? " He sighed as he put down his champagne . " Harvard , actually . Sounds obnoxious , does n't it ? " It was why he had n't told her at first . " Is it true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But there 's hope . I may flunk out before the end of the year . I 'm working on it . " " You ca n't be that bad or you would n't have gotten in . " " A Winslow not get in ? Do n't be absurd , my dear . We always get in . We practically built the place . " " Oh . . . " She looked impressed . " I see . And you did n't want to go ? " " Not especially . I wanted to go out West somewhere . I thought Stanford or UC , but Father had a fit , and it was n't worth arguing about it . . . so there I am , being a pain in the ass , and making them sorry they let me in . " " You must be a real treat for them . " Tana laughed , and she noticed that Arthur Durning and his group had just left . He had n't noticed her , and she was n't sure if she was glad or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me sometime , maybe during spring break . " She laughed at that and shook her head . " I doubt that . " " Do n't you trust me ? " He looked amused and very debonair for a boy of eighteen . " As a matter of fact , no . " She took another sip of champagne and they both laughed . She was feeling giggly now and she was having a good time with him . He was the first boy she had liked in a long time , and she liked him as a friend . He was fun to laugh with and she could say things to him that she had n't been able to say to anyone else recently , except Shar . And then she had an idea . " I might come up if I could bring a friend . " " What kind of friend ? " He asked suspiciously . " My roommate at Green Hill . " She told him about Sharon Blake then and he looked intrigued . " The daughter of Freeman Blake ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Wonderfuler . " She told him then about their being unable to get served at the coffee shop in Yolan , and the lecture given by Martin Luther King and he seemed interested in all of it . " I 'd like to meet her sometime . Do you really think you 'd come up to Cambridge at spring break ? " " Maybe , I 'll have to ask her . " " What are you two , joined at the hip ? " He looked Tana over appraisingly . She was one of the prettiest girls he had ever seen , and it would be worth putting up with someone else , just to see her . " More or less . I visited them at Thanksgiving , and I want to go back . " " Why do n't you have her here ? " There was a long pause and then Tana looked at him . " My mother would have a fit if she knew Sharon was black . I 've told her everything except that . " " Great . " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother was black , did n't I ? " For an instant he looked so honest that92 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 93she almost believed what he said and then he started to laugh and she made a face . " Pain in the ass . . . why do n't I just tell my mother about you ? " " Be my guest . " And she did the next day when he called to take her to lunch in two days . They had Christmas to endure in between . " Is n't that the boy you met last night ? " It was Saturday morningand Jean was relaxing with a book . She had n't heard from Arthur since the day before and she was dying to tell him about the ball , but she did n't want to bother him . She usually waited for him to call . It was a habit she had picked up when he was still married to Marie . And it was Christmas after all . He 'd be busy with Billy and Ann . " Yes , it is . " Tana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seems nice . " " He is . " But not in any way Jean would approve of , as Tana knew only too well . He was irreverent and outrageous and he drank too much , and he was obviously spoiled , but he had behaved decentlywhen he had brought her home . He had said goodnight and there was no wrestling match . She had been nervous about that , but she had n't needed to be . And when he came to pick her up for lunch two days later he wore a blazer and a tie and gray slacks , but as soon as they got downstairs , he put on roller skates and a crazy hat , and proceeded to behave like a complete madman as they walked downtown and Tana laughed at him . " Harry Winslow , you are completely nuts , do you know that ? ! " " Yes , ma'am . " He smiled and crossed his eyes , and insisted on wearing his roller skates into the Oak Room for lunch . The maitre d ' did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dare throw him out . He ordered a bottle of Roederer champagne , and guzzled a glass as soon as it was uncorked , and then set down the empty glass and smiled at Tana . " I think I 'm addicted to that stuff . " " You mean you 're a drunk . " " Yup . " He said it with pride , ordered lunch for them both , and after lunch they walked through Central Park and stopped at WollmanRink where they watched the ice skaters for more than an hour and talked about life , and he sensed that there was a strange reticenceabout her . She did n't offer herself , in a romantic sense , shewas careful and closed , and yet at the same time she was intelligent and warm . She cared about people and causes and things . But there was no hand held out . He knew that he had made a new friend , and no more , and she saw to it that he understood , in so many words , and it aroused his curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head , and her eyes met his . " No , nothing like that . I do n't want to get involved with anyone right now . " He was surprised at her honesty . And it was a challenge , too , of course , one he could n't completely resist . " Why not ? Afraid to get hurt the way your mother has been ? " She had never thought of it that way . It was why he had told her he did n't want kids . He did n't want to hurt anyone as badly as he himself had been hurt . And she had just told him how Arthur had stood her mother up for Christmas again that year . " I do n't know . Maybe . That , and other things . " " What kind of other things ' ? " " Nothing I want to talk about . " She looked away , and he tried to imagine what had marked her that way . She kept a safe distance between them , and even when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do n't get too close to me . " He hoped that there was nothing strange about the girl , about her sexual propensities , but he did n't think it was that . It was more that she seemed to be hiding in a protective shell , and he was n't sure why . Someone had driven her into it and he wondered who it was . " Was there someone important in your life before ? " " No . " She looked him square in the eye . " I do n't want to talk about that . " The look on her face made him back off at once . It was anger and hurt and something he could n't even define , but it was so powerful it took his breath away , and he did n't scare easily . But this time he got the point . A blind man would have . " I 'm sorry . " They changed the subject then and went back to talking about easier things . He liked her a lot , and he saw her several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lunch , went ice skating in the park , to a movie one night , and she even invited him to dinner one night with Jean . But that was a mistake , she recognized at once . Jean was grilling him as though he were a hot marriage candidate , asking about his future plans , his94 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 95parents , his career goals , his grades . She could hardly wait for him to leave , and when he did , she screamed at Jean . " Why did you do that to him ? He just came here to eat , not to ask me to marry him . " " You 're eighteen years old , you have to start thinking about things like that now . " " Why ? " Tana was enraged . " All he is is a friend , for chrissake . Do n't act like I have to get married by next week . " " Well , when do you want to get married , Tana ? " " Never , dammit ! Why the hell do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you going to do for the rest of your life ? " Her mother'seyes were hunting her , shoving her into corners and pushing her hard and she hated it . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do . Do I have to figure that out now ? Right now ? Tonight ? This week ? Shit ! " " Do n't talk to me like that ! " Now her mother was angry too . " Why not ? What are you trying to do to me ? " " I want to see you have some security , Tana . Not to be in the same boat I 'm in when you 're forty years old . You deserve more than that ! " " So do you . Did you ever think of that ? I hate seeing you like this , waiting around for Arthur all the time , like his slave . That 's all you 've been for all these years , Mother . Arthur Durning 's concubine . " She was tempted to tell her about seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do that to her mother . She did n't want to cause her that much pain and it would have for sure . Tana restrained herself but Jean was irate anyway . " That 's not fair and it 's not true . " " Then why do n't you want me to be like you ? " Jean turned her back on her , so that she would n't see her tears , and then suddenly she turned on Tana , and twelve years of sorrow showed in her eyes , and a lifetime before that . " I want you to have all the things I did n't have . Is that too much to ask ? " Tana 's heart suddenly went out to her and she backed down . Her voice was gentler as she spoke again . " But maybe I do n't want the same things you did . " " What is there not to want ? A husband , security , a home , children  --  what'swrong with all that ? " She looked shocked . " Nothing . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I want a career ? " Jean Roberts looked shocked . " What kind of career ? " " I do n't know . I just meant theoretically . " " That 's a lonely life , Tana . " She looked worried about her . " You 'd be better off if you just settled down . " But to Tana that felt like giving up , and she thought about it as she rode south on the train and she and Sharon talked about it their first night back in Jasmine House , once the lights were off . " Jesus , Tan , she sounds just like mine . . . in a different way , of course . But they all want for us what they wanted for themselves , no matter who we are , or how different we are from them , or what we think and feel and want . My dad understands , but my mom . . . all I hear about is law school , and sit-ins , and being ' responsible ' about being black . I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I came here in the first place , to Green Hill . I wanted to go somewhere where there would be other blacks . Hell , here I ca n't even date , and she tells me that there 's plenty of time for that . When ? I want to go out now , I want to have a good time , I want to go to restaurants and movies and football games . " She reminded Tana then , and the pretty blonde smiled in the dark . " Want to go to Harvard with me at spring break ? " " How come ? " Sharon propped herself up on one elbow in the dark with an excited look . And Tana told her about Harry Winslow then . " He sounds neat . Did you fall for him ? " " No . " " Why not ? " There was a silence which they both understood . " You know why . " " You ca n't let that screw you up for the rest of your life , Tan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me engaged to anyone by next week , as long as he 's willing to marry me , buy me a house , and give me kids . " " It beats the hell out of going to sit-ins and getting raw eggs in your hair . Does n't that sound like fun ? " Tana smiled . " Not much . " " Your Harvard friend sounds nice . " " He is . " Tana smiled to herself . " I like him a lot , as a friend . He 's the most honest , straightforward person I 've ever met . " The96 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 97call he made to her later that week underlined why she so enjoyed him . He called pretending to be the owner of a laboratory in Yolan , and they needed young ladies to perform experiments on , he explained . " We 're trying to find out if young ladies are as intelligent as young men , " he said , disguising his voice . " We realize of course that they are not , however . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she recognized his voice . " You shit ! " " Hi , kiddo . How 's life in the Deep South ? " " Not bad . " She let him speak to Sharon eventually , and the two girls stood beside the phone , passing it back and forth , and eventuallySharon went upstairs and Tana talked to him for hours . There were no romantic overtones at all , he was more like a brother to her , and after two months of phone calls , aside from Sharon he was her closest friend . He was hoping to see her at spring break , and she tried to get Sharon to come along , but to no avail . She decided to brave her mother , and invite Sharon to stay with them , but Miriam Blake had been on the phone to Sharon almost every night . There was an enormous black rally scheduled in Washington with a candlelightvigil for Civil Rights over Easter weekend and she wanted Sharon to be there . She felt that it was an important part of their life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was depressed about it when they both left Green Hill . " All you had to do was say no , Shar . " Tana looked at her and shook her head and for a moment something angry flashed in the pretty black girl 's eyes . " Just like you did about the coming out party , huh , Tan ? " There was a silence , and then slowly Tana nodded her head . Her friend was n't far wrong . It was difficult to fight with them all the time . She shrugged , with a sheepish grin . " Okay , you win . I 'm sorry . We 'll miss you in New York . " " I 'll miss you too . " She flashed her the dazzling smile , and they chatted and played cards on the train . Sharon got off in Washington , and Tana went on to New York . It was balmy and warm when she walked out of the station and hailed a cab , and the apartment looked the same as it always had , and somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back . There was a sameness to it all . Nothing grew , nothing changed . There were never freshdrapes , new plants , wonderful flowers , something exciting going on . There was the same thing , the same life , the same worn-out couch , the same dreary looking plants year after year . It had n't seemed quite so bad when she was living there every day , but now that she came and went , it looked different to her . Everything was shabbier , and the whole apartment seemed to have shrunk . Her mother was at work , and she threw her bags down in her room , just as the phone rang . She went back to the living room to pick it up , glancing around again . " Hello ? " " Winslow here . How 's it going , kid ? " She grinned . It was like a burst of fresh air in the stale , musty room . " Hello . " " When 'd you get in ? " " About four seconds ago . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a couple of the guys . And , " he looked lazily around the apartment his father owned at the Pierre , " here I am . Same old dump , same old town . " But he looked boyish when he smiled at his end of the phone , and Tana was excited at the prospect of seeing him again . They had learned so much about each other in the last four months on the phone , it was as though they were old friends now . " Want to come up for a drink ? " " Sure . Where are you ? " " At the Pierre . " He sounded unimpressed by his own whereaboutsand Tana grinned . " That 's nice . " " Not very . My father had the apartment redone by some decoratorlast year . It looks like a fag hangout now , but at least it 's free when I 'm in New York . " " Is your father there ? " She was intrigued and Harry laughed derisively . " Do n't be ridiculous . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The Germans are so emotional about Christianevents . That and the Oktoberfest . " He was slightly over her head . " Never mind . Come on over , and we 'll drive room service nuts . What do you want ? I 'll order something now , and it 'll take two hours to show up . " She was impressed . " I do n't know . . . a hamburger and a Coke ? Does that sound all right ? " There was something very im-98 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 99pressive about all this , but Harry was nonchalant about it all and when she arrived , he was lying on the couch in jeans and bare feet watching a soccer match on TV . He swept her off her feet , and gave her a huge bear hug , and it was obvious that he was genuinely pleased to see her , much more than she realized . His whole body tingled as he gave her a friendly peck on the cheek . And there was a moment of awkwardness , translating the intimacy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the afternoon , they were like old friends , and Tana hated to leave to go home . " Then stay . I 'll put some shoes on and we 'll go to 21 . ' " " Like this ? " She looked down at her plaid skirt and loafers and wool socks , but she shook her head . " I have to go home anyway . I have n't seen my mother in four months . " " I keep forgetting rituals like that . " His voice was flat , and he looked even handsomer than he had before , but nothing stirred in Tana 's heart for him , only the friendship that had continued to grow since they first met , nothing more than that , and she was sure that he had nothing other than platonic feelings for her as well . She turned to look at him now , as she picked her raincoat up off the chair . " Do n't you ever see your father at all , Harry ? " Her voice was soft and her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . He had spent the holidays alone , he said he always did , or with friends , or in empty houses or hotels , and he only mentioned his father in the context of bad jokes about his women and his friends and his gallivanting here and there . " I see him once in a while . We run into each other about once or twice a year . Usually here , or in the South of France . " It sounded very grand , but Tana easily sensed how lonely Harry was . It was why he had opened up so much to her . There was something inside him which was dying to reach out and be loved . And there was something like that in her too . A part of her which had only had Jean and had wanted more , a father , sisters and brothers , a family .. . something more than just a lonely woman who spent her life waiting for a man who did n't appreciate her . And Harry did n't even have that . Tana hated his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? " Harry shrugged again . " Good-looking , I guess . At least that 's what the women say . . . smart . . . cold . . . . " He looked Tana square in the eye . " He killed my mother , what do you think he'slike ? " Something shrivelled up in her as she watched her friend 's eyes , and she did n't know what to say . She was sorry that she had asked , but Harry put an arm around her shoulders as he walked her to the door . " Do n't let it upset you , Tan . It happened a long time ago . " But she was sad for him . There was something so lonely about him , and he was so funny and decent and nice , it was n't fair .. . and he was also spoiled and self-indulgent and mischievous . He had put on a British accent for the first room service waiter who 'd come up , and pretended to the second one that he was French , and afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always behaved like that and suspected that he did . And as she took the bus back uptown , she suddenly did n't mind the depressing little apartmentshe shared with Jean . Better that than the lavish , chilly decor of the Winslow suite at the Hotel Pierre . The rooms were large , and everything was chrome and glass and white , predictably expensive , there were two huge fabulous white fur rugs on the floor and there were priceless paintings and objects everywhere , but that 's all there was . There was no one there when he arrived from school , and there would n't be that night or the next . There was only Harry , with an icebox filled with booze and Cokes , a wardrobe of expensive clothes , and a TV . " Hi . . . I 'm home ... ! " She called out as she got in and Jean came running to her , and held her tight with a look of delight . " Oh baby , you look so good ! " It made her think of Harry again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his trusts , and his houses , and his fancy name . . . he did n't have this . And somehow Tana wanted to make it up to him . Jean was looking at her now and there was such obvious pleasure in her eyes that it actually felt good to be home . " I saw your bags . Where did you go ? " " I went to see a friend downtown . I did n't think you 'd be home for a while . " " I left work early , in case you 'd come in . " " I 'm sorry , Mom . " " Who did you go to see ? " Jean always liked to know what she did , who she saw . But Tana was n't as used to the questions anymore , and she hesitated for just a moment before she smiled . " I went to see Harry Winslow at the Pierre . I do n't know if you remember him . " " Of course I do . " Jean 's eyes lit up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULL CIRCLE 101 " He has an apartment here . " Tana 's voice was quiet , and there were mixed reviews in Jean 's eyes . It was good that he was mature enough , and solvent enough , to have his own place , but also dangerousat the same time . " Were you alone with him ? " Jean looked concerned . This time Tana laughed . " Sure . We shared a hamburger and watched TV . All perfectly harmless , Mom . " " Still . . . I do n't think you should . " She watched Tana 's eyes , as the pretty blonde 's face began to tense . " He 's my friend , Mom . " " He 's still a young man , and you never know what could happenin a situation like that . " " Yes , I do . " Her eyes were instantly hard . She knew only too well . Only it had happened at precious Billy Durning 's house , in his own father 's bedroom , with a hundred kids right downstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're too young to be able to judge things like that , Tan . " " No , I 'm not . " Tan 's face was like a rock . Billy Durning 's raping her had changed her whole life . She knew everything about things ) like that , and if she sensed any threat from Harry at all , she would never have gone to his hotel , or stayed . But she knew instinctively that he was her friend and she would come to no harm at his hands , unlike her mother 's lover 's son . " Harry and I are just friends . " " You 're being naive . There 's no such thing between boys and girls , Tan . Men and women ca n't be friends . " Tana 's eyes opened wide . She could n't believe her mother was saying those words . " How can you say a thing like that , Mom ? " " Because it 's true . And if he 's inviting you to his hotel , he has something else in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just biding his time . " And then she smiled . " Do you think he could be serious about you , Tan ? " " Serious ? " Tana looked as though she were about to explode . " Serious ? I just told you , all we are is friends . " " And I told you I did n't believe that . " There was something almost insinuating about her smile . " You know , Tan , he would be quite a catch . " But it was too much for Tana to stand . She jumped to her feet , and looked down at her mother with scorn . " You make him sound like a fish , for chrissake . I do n't want a catch . ' I do n't want to getmarried . I do n't want to get laid . All I want is to have some friends and go to school . Can you understand that ? " There were tears in her eyes , mirrored by those in Jean 's . " Why do you have to get so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Tan . " Jean 's voice sounded so sad that it tore at Tana 's heart , but she could n't help how she felt or what she said anymore . " You never used to push me all the time . " " When do I push ? " She looked shocked . " I do n't even see you anymore . I 've seen you twice in six months . That 's pushing ? " " That coming out party was pushing , and what you just said about Harry is pushing , and talking about catches , and settling down , and getting married is pushing . For chrissake , Mom , I 'm eighteen years old ! " " And you 're almost nineteen . And then what ? When are you going to think about it , Tan ? " " I do n't know , Mom . Maybe never , how 's that ? Maybe I 'll never get married . So what ? If I 'm happy , who cares ? " " I care . I want to see you married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house .... " Jean was crying openly now , it was what she had always wanted for herself . . . yet , she was alone ... with a couple of nights a week with a man she loved , and a daughter who was almost gone . . . She bent her head and sobbed , as Tana came to her and hugged her close . " Come on , Mom , stop . . . I know you want the best for me ... but just let me work things out for myself . " Her mother looked at her with big , sad , dark eyes . " Do you realize who Harry Winslow is ? " Tana 's voice was soft . " Yes . He 's my friend . " " His father is one of the richest men in the United States . He even makes Arthur Durning look poor . " Arthur Durning . The measuringstick for everything in Jean 's life . " So what ? " " Do you realize what kind of life you could have with him ? " Tana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . Her mother was missing the point , and probably had all her life . Butby the same token , Jean had given her so much . And Tana felt asthough she owed her a lot now . But in spite of that , she hardly sawJean during the entire two weeks she was in New York . She ran102 DANIELLE STEEL I FULL CIRCLE 103 , around with Harry almost every day , although she did n't admit it to Jean . She was still furious at what her mother had said . Do you realize who he is ? As though that made a difference to her . She wondered how many people felt that way about him . It seemed a hideous thought , to be evaluated because of his last name . Cautiously , she even asked Harry about it one day , when they were having a picnic in Central Park . " Does n't that bug you , Harry ? I mean people wanting to get to know you because of who you are ? " The thought still horrified her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass . " That 's just the way people are , I guess . It gives them some kind of a thrill . I used to see people do that to my father all the time . " " Does n't it get to him ? " " I do n't really think he cares . " Harry smiled at her . " He 's so insensitive , I do n't think he actually feels anything at all . " Tana watched Harry 's eyes . " Is he really that bad ? " " Worse . " " Then how come you 're so nice ? " He laughed . " Just lucky , I guess . Or maybe it 's my mother 's genes . " " Do you still remember her ? " It was the first time she had asked him that , and he looked away from her . " Sometimes . . . a little bit . . . I do n't know , Tan . " He looked back at her again . " Sometimes , when I was a kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she was out shopping or whatever when they came over to play . I did n't want to be different from the rest of them . But they always found out . Their mothers would tell them or something when they went home , and then they 'd think I was weird , but I did n't give a damn . It felt nice to be normal just for a few hours . I 'd just talk about her like she was out ... or upstairs . . . " Tan saw tears stand out in his eyes , and then he looked at her almost viciously . " Pretty dumb , huh , to be hung up on a mother you never even knew ? " Tana reached out to him with her heart and her words , and the gentleness of her voice . " I 'd have done the same thing in your shoes . " He shrugged and looked away , and a while later they went for awalk and talked about other things , Freeman Blake , Sharon , Tana 's classes at Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry took her hand . " Thanks for what you said before . " She knew instantly what he meant . They had that kind of rapport , had from the moment they first met . " It 's okay . " She squeezed his hand , and they walked on , and she was amazed at how comfortable she was with him . He did n't push her at all , did n't ask her anymore why she did n't go out with anyone . He seemed to accept her as she was , and she was grateful to him for that . She was grateful to him for a lot of things , for the way he saw life , for the fun they had , the sense of humor that always made her laugh . It felt wonderful to have someone to share her thoughts with . He was almost like a sounding board for everything she had in her head , and she was particularly grateful for that when she went back to Green Hill . When she saw Sharon again , it was as though her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate politicalideas had disappeared . She had attended a series of raffles and sit-ins with her mother and her friends , and suddenly she was as rabid as Miriam Blake was . Tana could n't believe the change that had taken place , and finally , after listening to her for two days , Tana turned to her and screamed . " For chrissake , Shar , what 's happened to you ? This room has been like a political rally ever since we got back . Get off your soapbox , girl . What the hell has happened to you ? " Sharon just sat there and stared and suddenly the tears flooded her eyes and she bowed her head , the sobs choked her and her shoulders shook and it was almost half an hour before she could speak , as Tana watched her in astonishment . Something terrible had happened to the girl , but it was impossible to say what it was . She held her and rocked her , and at last Sharon spoke , as Tana 's heart went out to her . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they killed him ... he was fifteen years old ... and he was hanged .... " Tana felt instantly sick . That could n't be . That did n't happen to people one knew . . . to blacks ... to anyone . . . but she could see on Sharon 's face that it was true , and when she called Harry that night , she cried when she told him the news . " Oh my God . . . I heard something about it in school , that the son of an important black had been killed , but it did n't click104 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 105 .. shit . . . . " He had been Sharon 's brother , and barely more than a child . " Yeah . " Tana 's heart felt like lead . And when her mother called her later that week , she still sounded depressed . " What 's the matter , sweetheart ? Did you and Harry have a fight ? " She was trying a new tack , she was going to pretend to ' herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take , but Tana did n't have any patience with her and she was instantly blunt . " My roommate 's brother died . " " Oh , how terrible . . . " Jean sounded horrified . " In an acci-dent ? " There was a long pause as Tana weighed her words . . . No , M o m , he was hanged , you see he 's black . ... " Sort of . " Was n't death always an accident ? Who expected it ? " Tell her how sorry I am . Those are the people you spent Thanksgiving with , are n't they ? " " Yes . " Tana 's voice sounded flat and dead . " That 's just terrible . " Tana could n't stand talking to her anymore . " I 've got to go , Mom . " " Call me in a few days  --  " " I 'll try . " She cut her off and hung up . She did n't want to talk to anyone , but she and Sharon were talking again late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed . She had even contacted the local black church , and she was helping to organize sit-ins on weekends for the remainder of the spring . " Do you think you should , Shar ? " Sharon looked angrily at her . " Is there a choice anymore ? I do n't think there is . " There was anger in her soul now , an anger that nothing would help , a fire that no love could quench . They had killed the little boy she had grown up with . " . . . and he was always such a pain in the ass .... " She laughed through her tears one night as they talked in the dark . " . . . He was so much like Mom , and now . . . and now ... " She gulped her sobs down , and Tana went to sit on her bed . It went on like that every night , either talking about marches elsewhere in the South , or sit-ins in town , or Dr. Martin Luther King , it was as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was panicking . She had n't done anystudying at all . She was a bright girl , but she was desperately afraid now that she was going to flunk . Tana helped her as much as she could , sharing notes , underlining her books for her , but she did n't have much hope , and Sharon 's mind was on the sit-in she had organized in Yolan for the following week . The townspeople had already complained about her twice to the Dean of Green Hill , but because of who her father was , they had only called her in and talked to her . They understood what a strain she was under , after her brother 's , er . . . unfortunate " accident , " but she had to behaveherself nonetheless , and they did n't want her causing trouble in town anymore . " You better lay off , Shar . They 're going to kick you out of school if you do n't stop . " Tana had warned her more than once , but it was something she could n't change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had to do , and the night before the big sit-in in Yolan she turned to Tana just before they turned off the lights and there was something so intense in her eyes that it almost frightened Tana as she looked at her . " Is something wrong ? " " I want to ask you a favor , and I wo n't be mad if you say no . I promise , so do whatever you want . Is that a deal ? " " Okay . What 's up ? " Tana just prayed that she did n't want her to cheat on a test . " Reverend Clarke and I were talking today , at the church , and I think it would make a big difference if there were whites involved in the sit-in tomorrow in town . We 're going to walk into the white church . " " Holy shit . " Tana looked shocked , and Sharon grinned . " That 's about right . " The two girls exchanged a smile . " Dr. Clarke is going to see who he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . maybe it 's wrong , but I wanted to ask you . But if you do n't want to , Tan , do n't . " " Why would they get upset if I walk into their church ? I 'm white . " " Not if you walk in with us , you 're not . That makes you white trash , or worse . If you walk in holding my hand , standing between me and Reverend Clarke or another black . . . that 's different , Tan . " " Yeah , " she felt a twinge of fear in her gut , but she also wanted to help her friend , " I guess I can see that . " 106 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 107 " What do you think ? " Sharon looked her square in the eye and Tana did the same . " Honestly ? I 'm scared . " " So am I. I always am . " And then very gently , " So was Dick . But he went . And I 'm going too . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life now , until things change . But it 's my fight , Tana , not yours . If you come , you come as my friend . And if you do n't come , I love you anyway . " " Thanks . Can I think about it tonight ? " She knew that it could have repercussions if it got back to the school , and she did n't want to jeopardize her scholarship for the following year . She called Harry late that night , but he was out , and she woke up the next morning at dawn , thinking about going to church when she was a little girl , and things her mother had said about all people being the same in God 's eyes , the rich , the poor , the white , the black , everyone , and then she thought about Sharon 's brother Dick , a fifteenyear-oldchild , hanged until he died , and when Sharon turned over in bed as the sun came up , Tana was waiting for her . " Sleep okay ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the bed and stretched . " You getting up ? " There was a question in Sharon 's eyes , and Tana smiled . " Yeah . We 're going to church today , are n't we ? " And with that Sharon grinned broadly at her friend . She hopped out of bed , and gave her a hug and a kiss and a victorious smile . " I 'm so glad , Tan . " " I do n't know if I am , but I think it 's the right thing to do . " " I know it is . " It was going to be a long , bloody fight , but Sharon would be there , and Tana , just this once . She put on a simple blue cotton shirtdress , the color of the sky , brushed her long blond hair into a sleek ponytail , put her loafers on , and they walked into town side by side . " Going to church , girls ? " the housemother had smilingly asked and both had answered yes . They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the black church with Sharon where they met Dr. Clarke and a small crowd of ninety-five blacks and eleven whites . They were told to stay calm , to smile if it seemed appropriate , but not if it would provoke anyone , and to remain silent no matter what anyone said to them . They were to hold handsand to enter the church solemnly and respectfully , in groups of five . Sharon and Tana were to remain together . There was another white girl with them , and two black men , both burly and tall , and they told Tana on the way to the other church that they worked at the mill . They were hardly older than the girls , but both were married , one had three children , the other four , and they did n't seem to question her being there . They called her Sister , and just before they walked into the church , the five companions exchanged a nervous smile . And then quietly , they stepped inside . It was a small Presbyterian church on the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday school that was well filled , and as the black faces began to file in , every man and woman in the church turned around . There was a look of complete shock on everyone , the organ stopped , one woman fainted , another began to scream , and within a matter of moments all hell broke loose , the minister began to shout , someone ran to call the police , and only Dr. Clarke 's volunteers remained calm , standing solidly along the back wall , causing no trouble at all , as people turned and jeered , hurled insults at them , even though they were in church . Within moments the town 's tiny squad of riot police had arrived . They had been recently trained for the sit-ins that had begun to occur and were mostly composed of highway patrolmen , but they began to push and shove and drag the uncooperating black bodies out , as they made themselves limp , and allowed themselves to be dragged away , and suddenly Tana realized what was happening to them . She was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it was happening to " us " and to her , and suddenly two enormous policemenhovered over her , and grabbed her roughly by both arms waving their sticks in her face . " You should be ashamed of yourself . . . white trash ! " Her eyes were huge as they dragged her off , and with every ounce of her being she wanted to hit and bite and kick , thinking of Richard Blake and how he had been killed , but she did n't dare . They threw her into the back of the truck , with much of Dr. Clarke 's group , and half an hour later , she was being fingerprinted and she was in jail . She sat in a jail cell for the rest of the day , with fifteen other girls , all of them black , and she could see Sharon across the way . They had each been allowed one phone call , the whites at least , the blacks were still being " processed " according to the cops , and Sharon shouted to her108 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tana did . She arrived in Yolan at midnight , and released Sharon and Tana simultaneously , congratulating them both . Tana could see that she looked harder and more drawn than she had six months before , but she seemed pleased with what the girls had done . She was n't even upset when Sharon told her the news the next day . She was being kicked out of Green Hill , effective immediately . Her things had already been packed by the housemotherof Jasmine House , and she was being asked to leave the campus before noon . Tana was in shock when she heard , and she knew what she could expect for herself when she was ushered into the Dean 's office . It was just as she had thought . She was being asked to leave . There would be no scholarship the following year . In fact , there would be no following year at all . Like Sharon , it was all over for her . The only difference was that if she was willing to stay on in a probationary state , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would at least mean that she could take her final exams and apply to another school . But where ? She sat in her room in shock after Sharon had left . Sharon was going back to Washington with her mother , and there had already been talk of her spending a little time as a volunteer for Dr. King . " I know Daddy 'll be mad because he wants me to go to school , but you know , truthfully , Tan , I 've had it up to here with school . " She looked sorrowfully at Tana then . " But what about you ? " She was devastated about the price of the sit-in for her friend . She had never gotten arrested before , although they had been warned before the church sit-in that it was a real possibility , yet she really had n't expected it . " Maybe it 's all for the best . " Tana tried to cheer her up , and she was still in shock when Sharon left , and she sat alone in her room until dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasmine House , keep to her room at night , and avoid all social activities including the freshman prom . She was a pariah of sorts , but she also knew that school would be over in three weeks . The worst of it was that , as they had warned Tana they would , they informed Jean . She called , hysterical , that night , sobbing into the phone . " Why did n't you tell me that little bitch was black ? " " What difference does it make what color she is ? She 's my best friend . " But tears filled Tana 's eyes and the emotions of the past few days overwhelmed her suddenly . Everyone at school was looking ather as though she had killed someone , and Sharon was gone . She did n't know where she would go to school next year , and her mother was screaming at her . . . it was like being five years old and being told you had been very , very bad , but not being sure why . " You call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She cost you your scholarship , and got you kicked out of school . And do you think you 'll get accepted anywhere else after this ? " " Of course you will , you jerk . " Harry reassured her through her sobs the next day . " Shit , there are zillions of radicals at BU . " " I 'm not a radical . " She cried some more . " I know that . All you did was go to a sit-in , for chrissake . It 's your own goddamn fault for going to that prissy redneck school . I mean shit , you are n't even in the civilized world down there . Why the hell do n't you come up here to school ? " " You really think I might be able to get in ? " " With your grades , are you kidding ? They 'd let you run the place . " " You 're just trying to make me feel better . " She started to cry again . " You 're giving me a mammoth pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let me get you an application and see what happens ? " And what happened was that she got in , much to her own astonishment and her mother 's chagrin . " Boston University ? What kind of school is that ? " " One of the best in the country , and they even gave me a scholarship . " Harry had taken the application over himself , put in a good word for her , which seemed like a crazy thing to do and touched her to the core , and by July first , it was settled . She was going to Boston University in the fall . She was still numb from the events of two months before , and her mother still wanted to wrestle about it with her . " I think you should get a job for a while , Tan . You ca n't hang around in school for the rest of your life . " Tana looked horrified . " How about for another three years , like until I get a degree ? " " And then what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could n't do now ? " " Get a decent job . " 110 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 111 " You could go to work for Durning International right now . I spoke to Arthur last week .... " Tana seemed to be screaming at her all the time now , but she never understood . " For chrissake , do n't condemn me to that for the rest of my life . " " Condemn you ! Condemn you ! How dare you say such a thing ? You get arrested , kicked out of school , and you think you have a right to the world . You 're lucky a man like Arthur Durning would even consider hiring you . " " He 's lucky I did n't bring charges against his son last year ! " The words flew out of Tana 's mouth before she could stop them and Jean Roberts stared at her . " How dare you say a thing like that ? " Her voice was quiet and sad , " It 's true , Mom . " She turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on Tana 's face , not wanting to hear . " I do n't want to hear you tell lies like that . " Tana walked quietly out of the room , and a few days later she was gone . She went to stay with Harry at his father 's place in Cape Cod , and they played tennis and sailed , swam , and visited his friends , and she never felt threatened by him at all . The relationship was en- tirely platonic as far as she was concerned and therefore comfort- able for her . Harry 's feelings were something else but he kept them carefully veiled . She wrote to Sharon several times , but the answers she got back were brief , scrambled , and obviously written in haste . She 'd never been so busy , or so happy , in her life . Her mother had been right , and she had a wonderful job working as a volunteer for Dr. Martin Luther King . It was amazing how their lives had changed in one short year . And when Tana started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different it was from Green Hill , how open , how interesting , how avant garde . She liked being in class with boys as well . Interesting issues were constantly raised and she did well in every class she took . And secretly Jean was proud of her , although her rapport with Tana was no longer as good as it had once been . She told herself it was a passing phase . She had other things on her mind anyway . By the end of Tana 's first year at Boston University , Ann Durning was getting married again . There was going to be an enormous wedding at Christ Episcopal Church in Greenwich , Connecticut , and a reception , organized by Jean , at the house . At the office , her desk was littered with lists , photographs , caterers ' lists and Ann called her at least fourteen times a day . It was almost as though her own daughterwas getting married , and after fourteen years as Arthur Durning'smistress and right arm , she felt possessive about the children anyway . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a lovely man of thirty-two , also previously married , and he was a partner at Sherman and Sterling , the law firm in New York , and from everything that Jean Roberts had heard , he was a very promising attorney , and he had plenty of money of his own . Arthur was also pleased about the match , and he gave Jean a beautiful gold bracelet from Cartier to thank her for all the work she did to make Ann 's wedding a success . " You 're really a wonderful woman , you know . " He sat in her living room , drinking a scotch , looking at her , wondering why he had never married her . Once in a while he felt like that , although most of the time now he was comfortable by himself . He was used to it . " Thank you , Arthur . " She handed him a small plate of the hors d'oeuvres he liked best , Nova Scotia salmon on little thin slices of Norwegian pumpernickel , little balls of steak tartare on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , in case he came by , along with his favorite scotch , favorite cookies . . . soap .. . eau de cologne . . . everything he liked . It was easier to be always ready for him now , with Tana gone . In some ways , that had helped their relationship , and in others , it had not . She was freer now , more available , always ready for him to come by at the drop of a hat , but at the same time , she was much lonelier with Tana gone , more anxious for his company . It made her hungrier , and lonelier , and less understanding when two weeks slid by without his spending a night in her bed . She realized that she should be grateful to him that he came to her at all , and he made so many things in her life easier , but she wanted so much more of him , she always had , ever since they first met . " Tana 's coming to the wedding , is n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she tried to look vague . She had called Tana about it only a few days before . She had n't responded to the invitation Ann had sent , and Jean had chided her for it , tellingher it was n't polite , and her Boston University manners did n't apply here , which of course had done nothing to warm Tana 's heart . " I 'll answer as soon as I get around to it , Mom . I have exams right now . It only came last week . " " It only takes a minute to respond . " Her tone annoyed Tana as it always did now , and she was curt when she replied . " Fine . Then tell her no . " " I 'll do nothing of the sort . You answer that invitation yourself . And I think you should go . " " Well , that comes as no surprise . Another command perfor- mance from the Durning clan . When do we get to say no to them ? " She still cringed every time she imagined Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " could make the effort for my sake at least . " them that you have no control over me . That I 'm impossi ble , that I 'm climbing Mount Everest . Tell them whatever the hell want ! " " You 're really not going , then ? " Jean sounded shocked , as though that were n't possible . " I had n't thought about it till now , but now that you mention it , I guess I 'm not . " " You knew it all along . " " Oh , for chrissake ... look , I do n't like Ann or Billy . Scratch that . I do n't like Ann , and I hate Billy 's guts . Arthur is your affair , if you 'll pardon the pun . Why do you have to drag me into this ? I 'm grown up now , so are they , we 've never been friends . " " It 's her wedding , and she wants you there . " " Bullshit . She 's probably inviting everyone she knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not true . " But they both knew it was . And Tana was stronger and stronger as time went on . In some ways , it was influence over her . He had definite ideas about almost ev- erything , and it brought something similar out in her in order to respond to him . He made her think about how she felt and what she about everything , and they were as close as they had ever been . And he 'd been right about BU too . Moving to Boston had been good for her , much more so than going to Green Hill . And in an odd way , she had grown up more in the last year than ever before . She was almost twenty years old . " Tana , I just ca n't understand why you behave this way . " It wasback to the wedding again , and her mother was driving her nuts . " Mom , can we talk about something else ? How are you ? " " I 'm fine , but I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " All right ! " She screamed into the phone at her end . " I 'll think about it . Can I bring a date ? " Maybe it would be more bearable if Harry came along . " I was expecting that . Why do n't you and the Winslow boy take a lesson from Ann and John and get engaged ? " " Because we 're not in love . That 's the best reason why not . " " I find that hard to believe after all this time . " " Fact is stranger than fiction , Mom . " Talking to her mother always drove her nuts , and she tried to explain it to Harry the next day . " It 's as though she spends the whole day planning what to say to me so that it will irritate me the most possible , and she never fails . She hits the nail right on the head every time . " " My father has the same knack . It 's a prerequisite . " " For what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're not irritating enough , they make you try again until you get it right . Then after the kid is born , they have to renew it every few years , so that after fifteen or twenty years , they 've really got it down . " Tana laughed at the idea as she looked at him . He was even more handsome than he had been when they first met , and the girls went crazy for him . There were always about half a dozen he was juggling at once , but he always made time for her . She came first , she was his friend , in fact she was much more than that to him , but Tana had never understood that . " You 're going to be around for a long time , Tan . They 'll be gone by next week . " He never took any of them seriously , no matter how desperately they wanted him . He did n't fool anyone , he was careful that no one got hurt , he was sensible about birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan . Life is too short for that , and there 's enough hurt out there without making more for your friends . " But there was no pretense offered either . Harry Winslow wanted to have fun , and nothing more than that . No I love you 's , no wedding rings , no starry eyes , just some laughs , a lot of beer , and a good time , if possible in bed . His heart was otherwise114 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 115engaged , albeit secretly , but other interesting parts of him were not . " Do n't they want more than that ? " " Sure they do . They 've got mothers just like you . Only most of them listen to their mothers more than you do . They all want to get married and drop out of school as soon as possible . But I tell them not to count on me to help them out . And if they do n't believe me , they figure it out soon enough . " He grinned boyishly and Tana laughed at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at them . She and Harry had been inseparable for the past year and she was the envy of all her friends . They found it impossi- ble to believe that nothing was going on between them , they were as puzzled as her own mother was , but the relationship stayed chaste . Harry had come to understand her by now , and he would n't have dared to scale the walls she had put up around her sexuality . Once or twice he tried to fix her up with one of his friends , just as a friendly double date , but she wanted nothing to do with it . His roommate had even asked him if she was a lesbian , but he was sure that it was n't that . He had a strong feeling that something had traumatized her , but she never wanted to talk about it , even with him , and he let it be . She went out with Harry , or her friends from BU , or by herself , but there were no men in her life , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " It 's a hell of a waste , you know , kid . " He tried to talk to her about it teasingly , but she brushed him off , as she always did . " You do enough of that for both of us . " " That does n't do you much good . " She laughed . " I 'm saving it for my wedding night . " " A noble cause . " He swept her a low bow and they both laughed . People at Harvard and BU were used to seeing them , raising hell , cavorting , playing pranks on each other and their friends . Harry bought a bicycle for two at a garage sale one week- end , and they rode around Cambridge on it , with Harry in a huge raccoon hat in the winter months , and a straw boater when the weather got warm . " Want to go to Ann Durning 's wedding with me ? " They were wandering across the Harvard Quad , the day after her mother had harassed her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it liable to be fun ? " " Not a chance . " Tana smiled angelically . " My mother thinks I should go . " " I 'm sure you expected that . " " She also thinks we should get engaged . " " I 'll second that . " " Good . Then let 's make it a double ceremony . Seriously , do you want to go ? " " Why ? " There was something nervous in her eyes and he was trying to figure out what it was . He knew her well , but every now and then she hid from him , albeit not too successfully . " I do n't want to go alone . I do n't like any of them . Ann 's a real spoiled brat , and she 's already been married once , but her daddy seems to be making a big fuss about this . I guess she did it right this time . " " What does that mean ? " " What do you think ? It means the guy she 's marrying has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angelically and Tana laughed . " It 's nice to know where people 's values are , is n't it ? Anyway , the wedding 's right after we get out of school , in Connecticut . " " I was going to the South of France that week , Tan , but I couldput it off for a few days , if it 'll help you out . " " That would n't be too big a pain in the ass for you ? " " It would . " He smiled at her honestly . " But for you , anything . " He bowed low , and she laughed , and he slapped her behind and they got back on the bicycle built for two , and he dropped her off at her dorm at BU . He had a big date that night . He had already invested four dinners in the girl , and he expected her to come through for him tonight . " How can you talk like that ! " Tana laughed and scolded him as they stood outside her dorm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without getting something for it . Besides , she eats those huge steaks with the lobster tails . My income is suffering from this broad , but . . . " he smiled , thinking of her mammaries , " ... I 'll let you know how it works out . " " I do n't think I want to know . " " That 's right . . . virgin ears . . . oh , well .... " He waved as he rode off on their bicycle . That night , she wrote a letter to Sharon , washed her hair , and116 DANIELLE STEEL FULL CIRCLE 117had brunch with Harry the next day . He had gotten nowhere with the girl , " The Eater " as he called her now . She had devoured not only her own steak , but most of his as well , her lobster as well as his once more , and then told him that she did n't feel well and had to go home and study for exams . He got nothing whatsoever for his pains except a large check at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in his bed . " That 's the end of her . Christ , the trouble you have to go to , to get laid these days . " But she knew from all she heard that he did fine most of the time , and she teased him about it all the way to New York in June . He dropped her off at her apartment and went on to the Pierre . When he picked her up the next day to go to the wedding , she had to admit that he looked spectacular . He was wearing white flannel slacks , a blue cashmere blazer , a creamy silk shirt his father had made for him in London the year before , and a navy and red Hermes tie . " Christ , Harry , if the bride had any sense , she 'd ditch this guy and run off with you . " " That headache I do n't need . And you do n't look bad yourself , Tan . " She was wearing a green silk dress almost the exact same color as her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had brushed it until it shone , just like her eyes , which sparkled as she looked at him . " Thanks for coming with me . I know it 's going to be a bore , but I appreciate it . " " Do n't be silly . I did n't have anything else to do anyway . I 'm not leaving for Nice until tomorrow night . " And from there he was driving to Monaco , where his father was picking him up on a friend 's yacht . Harry was going to spend two weeks with him , and then his father was dropping him off and going on with friends , leaving Harry alone in the house on Cap Ferrat . " I can think of worse fates , Tan . " He was hinting at the hell he would raise , chasing girls in the South of France , and living in the house alone , but it sounded lonely to her . He would have no one to talk to most of the time , no one who really cared about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the summer being smothered by Jean . In a moment of weakness , feeling guilty for the independence that had been so hard won , she had agreed to take a summer job , working for Durning International . And her mother was thrilled . " I could kill myself every time I think about it . " She groaned toHarry every time the subject came up . " I was nuts . But I feel so sorry for her sometimes . She 's so alone now that I 'm gone . And I thought it would be a nice thing to do for her , but Christ , Harry .. . what have I done ? " " It wo n't be that bad , Tan . " " Want to make a bet ? " Her scholarship had come through for the following year , and she wanted to make some pocket money to spend . At least this would help . But it depressed her beyond words to think of spending the whole summer in New York , living with Jean , and watching her kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought made her sick . " We 'll go to the Cape for a week when I come back . " " Thank God for that . " They exchanged a smile as he drove her to Connecticut , and a little while later , they were standing in Christ Episcopal Church with the rest of the guests , painfully hot in the stifling June air , and then mercifully they were released and they drove to the Durning house , passing through the enormous gates , as Harry watched her face . It was the first time she had been back since the nightmare night two years before . Exactly two years in fact . And there was a thin veil of sweat on her upper lip as she thought of it . " You really do n't like it here , do you , Tan ? " " Not much . " She glanced out the window and looked vague as he watched the back of her head . But he could sense something inside her go tense , and it was worse once they parked the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriatethings . Tana introduced Harry to Arthur and the bride and groom , and then as she ordered a drink , she saw Billy staring at her . He was watching her intently , and Harry was watching him , as he wandered away , and Tana seemed to be in a stupor after that . She danced with Harry several times , with several people she did n't know , chatted with her mother once or twice , and then suddenly in a lull , she found herself face to face with Billy . " Hello there . I wondered if you 'd come . " She had an overwhelmingurge to slap his face , but instead she turned away . She could n't breathe just looking at him . She had n't seen him since that night , and he looked as malevolent as he had then , as weak and evil and spoiled . She could remember his hitting her , and then . . . " Get away from me . " She spoke in a barely audible voice. 118 DANIELLE STEELFULL CIRCLE 119 " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's wedding day . It 's a romantic event . " She could see that he was more than slightly drunk . She knew that he had graduated from Princeton a few days before and he had probably been drinking nonstop since then . He was going into the family firm , so he could screw around and chase secretaries . She wanted to ask him who he 'd raped recently , but instead she just started to walk away and he grabbed her arm . " That was a pretty rude thing to do . " She turned back to him , her teeth clenched , her eyes wild . " Get your hand off of me or I 'm going to throw this drink in your face . " She hissed like a snake , and suddenly Harry materialized at her side , watching her , seeing something he had never seen before , and also noting the look in Billy Durning 's eyes . Billy Durning whispered one word , " whore , " with a vicious look in his eyes , and with a single gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Billy groaned and tried to fight back but he did n't want to make a scene and Harry whispered in his ear , as he gripped his tie with his free hand , nearly choking him . " Got the picture , pal ? Good , then why do n't you just take yourself off right now ? " Billy wrenched his arm free , and without saying a word , he walked away as Harry looked at Tana . She was shaking from head to foot . " You all right ? " She nodded , but he was n't convinced . She was deathly pale , and her teeth were chat- tering despite the heat . " What was that all about ? An old friend ? " " Mr. Durning 's adorable son . " " I take it you two have met before . " She nodded . " Not very pleasantly . " They stayed for a little while after that , and it was obvious that Tana was anxious to leave so Harry suggested it first . He did n't say anything for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her visibly unwind as they put some distance between them and the Durning house . He had to ask her then . Something so powerful had been in the air , it frightened him for her . " What was that all about , Tan ? " " Nothing much . An old hatred , that 's all . " " Based on what ? " " He 's a complete prick , that 's what . " They were strong words for her and Harry was surprised , and there was no humor in hervoice . " A rotten little son of a bitch . " Tears burned her eyes and her hands shook as she lit a cigarette , which she almost never did . " I figured you two were n't the best of friends . " Harry smiled but she did n't respond . " What did he do to you , to make you hate him so much , Tan ? " Somehow , he had to know . For her sake and his own . " It 's not important now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not ! " She was shouting at him , and there were suddenlytears rolling down her cheeks . None of it had healed in the past two years , because she had n't allowed the air to get to it . She had n't told anyone except Sharon , had n't fallen in love , had n't gone on any dates . " It does n't matter anymore . " He waited for her words to die down . " Are you trying to convinceme or yourself ? " He handed her his pocket handkerchief and she blew her nose , as the tears rolled down her cheeks . " I 'm sorry , Harry . " " Do n't be . Remember me ? I 'm your friend . " She smiled through her tears and patted his cheek , but something terrible had come back to haunt her again . " You 're the best friend I 've got . " " I want you to tell me what happened with him . " " Why ? " He smiled . " So I can go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go ahead . " She laughed for the first time in hours . " Seriously , I think you need to get it off your chest . " " No , I do n't . " That frightened her more than living with it . Shedid n't even want to talk about it now . " He made a pass at you , did n't he ? " " More or less . " She was looking out the window again . " Tana . . . talk to me . . . . " She turned to him with a wintry smile . " Why ? " " Because I give a damn . " He pulled the car off the road , turned off the ignition , and looked at her . He knew suddenly that he was about to open a door that had been sealed tight , but he knew that for her sake he had to open it . " Tell me what he did to you . " She stared into Harry 's eyes and spoke expressionlessly . She tried to shake her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he gently took her hand as she finally said the words . " He raped
