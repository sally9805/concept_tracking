A decade ago food co-operatives operating out of storefronts and homes lent a certain cachet to that era of consciousness-raising . There was , above all , camaraderie , a spirit of working for the common weal . Reduced food prices was the means . Today , food co-ops still occupy storefronts - but fewer homes - and offer items discounted as high as 20 percent . But there is a new spirit , based more on day-to-day economic realities . In short , food co-ops are getting down to business , becoming immersed in the things - capital formation , computerization , cost and inventory controls - that determine any businesses ' future . And the future is what concerns food co-ops the most , for , as a national food cooperative task force recently reported , " In 1980 the dominant type of food store in the United States was the chain supermarket , selling between $4 million and $8 million a year . Nearly one-fourth of all US food store sales flow through this type of outlet . " The Report of the National Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the 1980s as " the pressure to reduce costs of operation and thereby reducing consumer prices . Many of the newer cooperatives , which have tended to specialize in natural foods and perishables , have the high operating costs of small business enterprises . They will be facing severe competition and reduced margins in the next few years as conventionally operated stores begin to provide a greater portion of these product lines . " Stephen Brophy , a coordinator for the New England Food Cooperative Organization ( NEFCO ) of Cambridge , boiled down the realities . " There is much more of an awareness today among food co- op managers of sophisticated business practices , " he said . " When co- ops began , " he added , " one of the ideals was not recognizing a business structure . " Recognizing and implementing sound business practices doesn ' t mean that henceforth food co-ops will be dominated by men and women in grey flannel suits . James F. O ' Connor , who joined NEFCO as controller a year ago , says , " We don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever is on balance-sheet projections rather than on produce . NEFCO , formed 10 years ago , is a wholesale supplier to 183 members in eastern Massachusetts , Rhode Island , New Hampshire and Vermont . Its annual volume is about $5 million , divided evenly between produce , dairy goods and natural foods . For the fiscal year ended Sept. 28 , NEFCO was " $4000 or $5000 under the break-even point , " O ' Connor said . " Cash flow is good , " he said , " and receivables are low for a business because of tight - mostly COD - payment terms . " Two of NEFCO ' s largest members are the Cambridge Food Co-op and the Boston Food Co Op Inc. of Allston . Their operations illustrate the new business thinking . Eliza Strode , 25-year-old general manager of the Cambridge Co- op , sees the ultimate challenge in the natural foods area . " Co-ops created the natural foods market , " said Strode , a Brown University graduate who managed a small natural foods co-op in Providence before coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have to worry about flak ; now we have to because of the competition . " The Cambridge Co-op , opened on 1975 , has 2500 members , employs seven full- time and several part-time workers and stocks 3000 different items - from soups to nuts . The 1982 annual sales were $1.3 million , a 7 percent increase over 1981 . Thirty percent of sales comes from non-working members , who pay a 12 1/2 percent surcharge on goods purchased , Strode said . ( Each member devotes 2 1/2 hours per month to the storefront operation . ) " We had to adapt to the times and admit non-working members , " Strode explained . " People today just don ' t have that much time for volunteer work . " Strode is still in the throes of " tightening up " operations and laboring with the organization plans and financial schedules so common to businees in general . Progress can be seen , she said , in 1982 results , which were profitable . " Because ours is a business controlled by members , profits are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kim Klausner has been monitoring the finances of the Boston Food Co Op since last November . Established in 1972 , the Boston Co Op has 3000 members , each of whom contributes two hours a month . Sales last year " were more than $1 million , " said Klausner , 29 , who has taken accounting and small business management courses at Boston University and Bunker Hill Community College . Effective July 15 , the work requirement will no longer be mandatory , she said , and a 15 percent surcharge will be implemented . " The 15 percent ' s not great , " she said , " but we have to do something to increase sales . Fifteen years ago , people had more time . Now most members are not students and havefamilies . " One of the hallmarks of her tenure , she said , " Is that records are finally being kept . We ' re still on a manual system , but we ' re headed toward computerization . " The back half of the Boston Co Op building is rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " covers operating expenses , " she said . Some funds are in the money market , and the group has no bank loans outstanding . " We do have loans totalling $50,000 from members , on which we pay 10 percent interest annually , " Klausner said . " We also probably have $10,000 invested in co-ops in the Midwest and $10,000 invested in NEFCO . " In the next few years , she said , " We ' ll be trying to find ways of building equity . It may be that we ' ll require members to buy bonds , refundable when they leave . " While Klausner and her colleagues in the food co-op movement may never be obsessed with profits , Thomas Osborn , 44 , is management coordinator of the for-profit western Massachusetts cooperatives in Hatfield . The group ' s 175 members " are basically stockholders , " Osborn said . " In good years , patronage refunds are distributed based on shareholders ' sales . " Sales for the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30 were $2.5 million , he said . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . " We ' re just getting our computer on-line , " he said . " Up until just recently ourfinancial management system was atrocious . " Can atrociousness be replaced across-the-board nationally by financial achievements ? Osborn provided a perspective . " Years ago , there were farm co-ops such as Hood and Land O ' Lakes , " he said . " Then 20 years ago , there was a so-called new wave ' of anti-business , politically oriented co-ops . In the last six to eight years , the economic realities have forced co-ops to adopt management techniques . We call this era the third wave . ' Today , everybody is looking over his shoulder for the fourth wave ' - whatever that might be . "
