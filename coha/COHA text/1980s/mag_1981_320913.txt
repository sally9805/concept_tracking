Old bones in an okra patch lead to a prehistoric zoo <P> When a hired hand brought in some skeletal remains unearthed on their okra farm in Archer , Fla. , Ron and Pat Love asked a scientist friend to identify them . Horse bones , he said , good for nothing more than paperweights . Dissatisfied , the Loves sought a second opinion from Paleontologist S. David Webb of the Florida State Museum in Gainesville . Webb quickly determined that the bones had come not from a horse but from a short-legged rhinoceros called Teleoceras . It was a creature that had lumbered across that area of Florida millions of years ago . <P> Since that chance discovery in the summer of 1974 , the Love homestead has become a landmark in North American paleontology . In seven years of excavation , Webb and his students have dug up-from what has been dubbed the Love Bone Bed-bits and pieces of more than 100 species of animals , many of them long extinct . All date back to the late Miocene epoch , about 9 million years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a giant camel some 18 ft. high , an extinct raccoon as big as a bear , various ancient horses and dogs - and the Carcharodon megalodon , a relative of the great white shark . As Ron Love puts it , " They had one hell of a zoo here . " <P> The vestiges of that prehistoric menagerie came out of a hole about 150 ft. long , 60 ft. wide and 25 ft. deep , abutting Florida 's Route 241 outside of Gainesville . It was excavated at the site of what once was a fast-moving stream that flowed into a great salt marsh along the Gulf of Mexico . Bodies of dead animals collected in the water , and the remains sank to the bottom of the stream . As layer after layer of sediment piled up , the stream eventually vanished , but the bones of the fauna were fossilized and preserved . <P> In years of digging into the ancient riverbed , Webb and his students sifted through more than 100 tons of clay , working thousands of hours in the sun . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious and vandals . To drive them off , recalls Love , he would occasionally fire his bird gun . Says he : " I got the reputation for a while as a crazy farmer . " <P> All the digging and shooting have paid off handsomely . Webb considers the Love pit one of the richest U.S. fossil finds in years , unequaled anywhere in the Southeast . Some specimens turned up in almost wholesale quantities . His team , for example , dug up so many saber-toothed tiger bones that they may help shed a totally new light on the ferocious-looking cats . Some were so young they still had baby teeth , others were 25 to 30 years old . ( In appreciation of the Loves , researchers even named one new sabertooth species after them : Barbourofelis lovei. )
