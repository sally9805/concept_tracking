What 's to be done with millions of gallons of wine spiked with antifreeze ? The Austrian Ministry of Agriculture has wrestled with that question for more than a year since it seized several warehouses of white wine that vintners and dealers had illegally sweetened with diethylene glycol , an antifreeze component . Pouring the stuff into a river or out onto the ground would only poison the water table and outrage Austria 's watchful environmentalists . <P> Now Toni Kahlbacher , a Kitzbuhel snowplow maker , seems to have found a use for the tainted tipple . Kahlbacher mixed the wine with road salt to produce a concoction that melts ice more effectively than salt alone . That should delight both Agriculture officials and the Ministry of Public Construction , which estimates that clearing winter roads will take a third less salt thanks to the polluted wine .
