BEACHWOOD , Ohio  --  One day last August , Judy Fink glanced into her back garden and saw clouds of white mist drifting across her lawn . She marched out to confront two ChemLawn Corp. workers who were spraying her neighbor ' s shrubs . " We used to have our lawns sprayed like everyone else , but we stopped immediately when I learned about the dangers to people and animals , " says Mrs. Fink , who lives in this Cleveland suburb . " There ' s enormous peer pressure here  --  one weed in your lawn and the whole neighborhood is down on you . " Mrs. Fink has joined citizens from Oregon to Connecticut who are vigorously campaigning against lawn-care companies that spray customers ' yards without warning nearby residents . Almost a dozen communities are considering ordinances that would require companies to post warning signs on sprayed lawns . Wauconda , Ill. , was the first town to enact such a measure earlier this year . At issue are the chemicals the companies use , such as the weed killer 2 , 4-D , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by attacking the central nervous system . The companies say that the chemicals , in the concentrations used on lawns , aren ' t toxic enough to hurt healthy people or pets . But both agents can cause severe illness in people with allergies , and the chemicals ' long-term effects are still being investigated . " The aged , people who have pulmonary problems or asthma can be more sensitive to these pesticides , " says Aaron Anton , professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio . The industry estimates that one-third of homeowners who treat their lawns use a lawn-care service . The remaining two-thirds , companies say , buy fertilizers and weed killers with the same chemicals used in the sprays . Companies such as Barefoot Grass Lawn Service Inc. of Worthington , Ohio , argue that professional appliers shouldn ' t be burdened by putting up signs if amateur users aren ' t . The lawn-service industry has been growing 25% to 30% a year since its start in the mid-1960s . Columbus , Ohio-based ChemLawn , with $227. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest of the lawn-care concerns . Although the company says the flap hasn ' t hurt sales , it is fighting hard to stop the Wauconda ordinance from spreading elsewhere . " We don ' t feel the toxicity of our product warrants the posting of signs that will be interpreted by many people as a warning , " says Roger Yeary , ChemLawn ' s toxicologist . " People will read such a sign as they read a railway crossing warning  --  if you cross there ' s a high probability of a harmful result occurring . We don ' t think that ' s so . " But ordinance advocates say that ChemLawn already warns its customers . Pamphlets left at treated households contain a section titled " For Your Own Safety " that says children and pets should be kept off sprayed areas until the chemicals dry . ChemLawn says the process takes less than two hours . " All we are saying is that neighbors have a right to know that too , " says Kim Hill , a resident of Lyndhurst , Ohio , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected a thick file of statements from neighbors telling of bad experiences that seemed to follow sprayings . They range from an account by an allergic woman of serious respiratory problems to a story of the death of an English bulldog . A beekeeper says bees rely on early blooming spring weeds , such as dandelions , and laments that people spray poisons " on every square foot of surface that they live on . " The pesticide industry says such statements point to a broader campaign against their product than a request for warning signs . " This is part of the anti-pesticide movement , " says David Dietz , program director of Pesticide Public Policy Foundation , the lawn-care industry ' s trade group . " You haven ' t only got local governments looking at this , you ' ve got Congress and the courts addressing the issue and all kinds of regulatory schemes being proposed . " The foundation is suing to repeal the Wauconda law . Mr. Hill says the industry is overreacting . " They ' ve intimidated a lot of little cities that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " It ' s a pretty drastic response to concerned people who only are asking for the right to know . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
