The two pairs of pure , uncarved African elephant tusks were expected to bring their owner between $20,000 and $28,000 in an auction last week at Sotheby 's in New York City . But they never made it to the block . Last week Sotheby 's not only withdrew the tusks from sale but promised to stop dealing in elephant tusks or any jewelry , furniture or artwork containing ivory that is less than 50 years old . The change of heart was inspired by an outcry that began soon after the tusks appeared in Sotheby 's catalog . Clients and environmentalists said the sale would encourage poachers who are wiping out Africa 's elephant herds . In a half-page ad in the New York Times , a Connecticut-based group called Friends of Animals asked , " Why auction elephant tusks in the midst of an elephant holocaust ? " <P> Sotheby 's removed the tusks from the market by buying them from the unidentified owner , and will donate them to a museum . " We will never again sell elephant tusks , " said Michael Ainslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sets an example . " Environmental groups hope so as well . The U.S. imports about $30 million worth of ivory annually . Much of it is illegally harvested in a slaughter that each year wipes out nearly 100,000 of Africa 's elephants , reducing their current numbers to as few as 600,000 . To cut demand , the African Wildlife Foundation , a Washington-based group , has written letters to 11,000 jewelers in the U.S. asking them to stop selling ivory products . Several major retailers , including Macy 's , have already agreed to phase out ivory sales .
