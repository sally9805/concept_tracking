Jeffrey Charles Davis , 36 , seemed inexorably drawn to the Viet Nam Veterans Memorial in Washington . A D.C. police officer for more than 15 years , Davis is said to have once called the memorial " the ugliest thing I ever saw . " Yet he would often visit it after finishing his duty , to stare at the 148 black granite slabs inscribed with the names of the 57,939 Americans killed or missing in the Viet Nam War . A decorated veteran , Davis had served in Viet Nam with the 101st Airborne Division when he was only 17 years old . On a bright cool morning last week , Davis , a husband and father of two small children , was found sitting in civilian clothes under a tree just a few hundred feet from the memorial . He had shot himself in the head . <P> It was the first suicide anyone could recall at the monument . To most of his friends , Davis had not seemed traumatized by Viet Nam , but some said he had returned cynical and bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said former Marine Mike Conner , one of the veterans who help stand a 24-hour volunteer watch at the memorial . " Maybe the survivor guilt got to him . " <P> For many who knew him , Davis ' death brought back the anguish of Viet Nam . Said the Rev. Walter Childress in his eulogy : " The human frailties and vulnerabilities of that war will be with us as long as they live-Viet Nam Veterans Memorial those who fought there . "
