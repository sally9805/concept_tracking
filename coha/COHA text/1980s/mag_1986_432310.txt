 | Since the drive to raise academic standards took hold nearly three years ago , school has been getting tougher . Virtually every state has raised highschool-graduation requirements . Twenty also insist that students pass minimum-competency tests to graduate or be promoted to the next grade . But the push for excellence may be pushing out thousands of youngsters already having trouble in school . One of every 4 freshmen who enter high school in the U.S. fails to graduate , a situation that is spurring a wide range of programs to contain the problem . Notes Nathan Quinones , chancellor of the New York City school system : " If we are to take credit for improving academic achievement without considering the dropout rate , then we are undermining that achievement . And if we do n't do something , we are going to sap the strength of this country . " In some urban schools , more students drop out than graduate . Among Hispanic youth , 40 percent of those who leave do so before the 10th grade . Since the early ' 70s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has declined from 77 percent in 1972 to 74 percent in 1984 . The implications of a high dropout rate are staggering . A 1985 study by the Chicago Panel on Public School Finances shows that high-school dropouts are far more dependent on welfare and unemployment aid and much more likely to be involved in criminal activity than high-school graduates . It is estimated that the 12,804 dropouts from Chicago 's public-schools class of 1982 will cost taxpayers about $60 million each year for the next 40 years , or $2.5 billion over their lifetimes . A recent report by the Education Commission of the States adds : " The entry-level labor pool . . . contains more and more of the kinds of teenagers employers have been able to overlook in the past : Poorly motivated , lacking fundamental literacy skills and unacquainted with the responsibilities and demands of the work world . " To combat the problem , educators are looking closely at the reasons why students drop out . A U.S. Education Department study found " poor grades " among the top reasons for leaving cited by dropouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the females while " job offers " drew away 27 percent of the males . A third of all students simply said : " School was not for me . " The factors underlying students ' departures take root early . By high school , most future dropouts are at least two years older than their classmates ? after repeating several grades because of academic failure ? and are reading at an elementary level . " Most of the time , " notes Wayne Cornett of the Laurel County ( Ky . ) Alternative School , " these students dropped out ' in the fifth grade but stayed in school until they were 16 . " Such students generally try to cover their failure with behavior that frustrates teachers and administrators , compounding their problems . Jeff Crocker of Oxon Hill , Md. , began " playing around in school " before quitting at 16 because " I was n't accomplishing anything . It felt like the teacher gave the lesson but did n't care if I got it or not . " Recalls 20-year-old Lisa Hawkins of Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then two or three . Some days , I would stay out a whole week . I 'd want to be better , but I did n't know how to catch up . " She left school at 16 . Making students feel that school is important and that their presence matters is the cornerstone of dropout-prevention efforts . In New York City , which recently cut its dropout rate to 35 percent from 42 percent , students at 10 high schools receive extensive counseling and in-house jobs like tutoring and maintenance work that let them earn money as they build self-esteem . Letting prospective dropouts know they are needed at school can have dramatic results . After a Chicago highschool principal wrote letters last year to 500 students who had quit school , about 200 returned , letters in hand . The lure of street freedom is strong , so simply caring is not enough . It must be reinforced with strict standards for attendance and behavior , small classes and teachers who are as much friends and counselors as subject-matter experts . Los Angeles officials are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These youngsters will receive intensive reading instruction to head off academic . troubles . Smaller cities and rural areas also are fighting the problem . Fall River , Mass. , with a school district of 12,000 , started an extensive " educational opportunity " program three years ago after it found that 50 percent of its students were quitting school . Middle-school children who need special academic help are placed in a self-contained classroom  | where two instructors teach all subjects . Students gain a closer relationship with their teachers , who can catch problems more quickly . Likewise , Laurel County , Ky. , in Appalachia , which loses 3 of every 10 students , has returned to the days of the one-room schoolhouse . The first alternative school , opened last fall , serves 40 teenagers in grades 8 through 11 , divided between two classrooms . Special efforts are needed to help the thousands of pregnant girls who leave school . The New Futures School in Albuquerque enables pregnant teenagers to stay in school by providing child care for youngsters through age 4 . Says graduate Lena Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a scholarship : " Everything I have now is because of the school . " To further enhance local efforts , the National Education Association , which represents 1.7 million teachers , is devoting $700,000 of members ' dues to fund grants for innovative dropout programs . States are getting more involved as well . Wisconsin requires districts with more than 50 dropouts or an annual dropout rate of greater than 5 percent to submit a prevention plan to the state . More schools are opening chapters of 70001 , a national nonprofit organization that provides job training and highschool-equivalency classes to dropouts . Eighty percent of the students complete the program , and 60 percent are still employed 90 days after graduation . That combination has given new hope to 17-year-old Cecil Boyd of Washington , D.C. , a dropout who joined the training program this year after fruitless efforts looking for work . " When you have no high-school diploma , " he says , " you might as well be telling employers you do n't want a job . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
