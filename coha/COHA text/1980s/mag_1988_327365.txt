In 5,000 mailboxes stuffed full of ordinary Christmas greetings , one card is sure to stand out : the Yuletide message sent by Arizona Governor Rose Mofford to celebrate her first year in office . Mailed to friends , journalists and fellow government officials across the country , Mofford 's missive is a caricature of herself as a toga-clad Goddess of Liberty perched atop the state capitol dome . In recent years the beehive-coiffed Governor , 66 , has sent out similar cards showing herself as Uncle Sam , Santa Claus and even Mae West . If the practice catches on among Governors , next Christmas may bring portraits of George Deukmejian as Plato and Mario Cuomo as St. Augustine .
