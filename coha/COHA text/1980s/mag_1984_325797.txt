Gary Hart claims to be the candidate of new ideas . Walter Mondale ca n't see it . In a strict sense , Mondale is right . At least , that 's how Harry Truman would have seen it . Back in 1961 Truman , whose 100th birthday will be celebrated May 8 around a world still appreciative of his stewardship , told Author Merle Miller : " The only thing new in the world is the history you do n't know . The only thing that changes is the names we give things . " <P> Most ideas that work their way up to the presidency have been around for a while in one form or another . A lot of the nostrums for the Depression , for instance , were debated in the days of Herbert Hoover . But the man who got serious about them and acted on them , Franklin Roosevelt , became known as the New Thinker . John Kennedy did not dream up the Peace Corps . He swiped the idea from Congressman Henry Reuss and Senator Hubert Humphrey , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Deal . <P> Political tradition allows an idea , no matter its vintage or origin , to be claimed as new when unearthed and proposed by a new contender under new circumstances . Indeed , the older the newer . <P> The easiest riposte to such new political thought is to claim it does not exist ( " Where 's the beef ? " ) . By dismissing a new notion out of hand , a critic hopes to pre-empt debate on the idea without being forced to wrestle with the merit or the substance . For longer than anyone in Washington can remember , Presidents have been confronted by frothing opponents who claim , " He has no foreign or domestic policy . " Translated , that generally means , " I wo n't accept his ideas but I do n't have anything of my own . " Fortunately , such obfuscation does not prevail long . The political record indicates that any President who acts successfully to change things gets the credit for initiating a fresh approach no matter how old the ideas . <P> Many people heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with China 's Mao Tse-tung . L.B.J. did not raise the idea publicly or make it his doctrine . Richard Nixon did , and is credited with the most creative diplomatic idea of the era . <P> Ronald Reagan 's ideas are as old as Calvin Coolidge , whose portrait still hangs in the Cabinet Room . Yet scholars now are writing that Reagan , agree with him or not , brought dramatic new methods and directions to the presidency .
