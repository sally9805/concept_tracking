A high school girl : " I intend to be President . " A young woman : " I intend to go back to school . " And a pregnant woman : " I intended to have a family ... but not this soon . " Says an announcer : " Unintended pregnancies have risks . Greater risks than any of today 's contraceptives . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wants you to have the facts . For your free booklet call 1-800-INTENDS . " <P> All three of the major networks rejected this public service TV announcement as too controversial . The booklet that is offered , The Facts , tells young people , " It 's okay to say ' no , ' " but that if they do have sex , then the pill and condom are the safest birth control methods . Network officials steer away from the topic of contraceptives , even in paid advertisements . Says George Schweitzer , a CBS vice president : " The proper forum for the discussion is in news and public affairs programs where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Observers question that stance , pointing out that the U.S. leads industrialized countries with an estimated 1.1 million pregnancies each year for girls ages 15 to 19 . Public health officials in Tennessee and Georgia want stations to run the spot , but few outlets other than the Cable News Network have agreed to give it time . The networks ' position is questionable , critics argue , because daytime soaps and prime-time series like Dynasty routinely glamourize sex without suggesting its risks . Says Jeanne Rosoff , president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute , a nonprofit research center : " Network program content is explicit to the point where one ABC-TV executive was quoted as saying , ' We are reaching the point of physical motion under the covers of a bed . ' I ca n't see how the word contraceptive is going to shock anybody . "
