George Shultz has long argued that the U.S. Secretary of State needs a large and secure home where he can entertain visiting dignitaries . Last week his wish came a step closer to fulfillment when it was disclosed that philanthropist Gwendolyn Cafritz posthumously donated her landmark mansion to become the Secretary 's official residence . Cafritz , a Washington socialite who died Nov. 29 at age 78 , set aside money from her estate to restore and maintain the $9 million mansion before turning it over to the Government . <P> - Her gift may nevertheless be refused . Government acceptance will need special congressional approval , thanks to a law written by Shultz 's tenacious Senate adversary Jesse Helms . The conservative North Carolina Republican argues that providing living quarters for the Secretary of State would be unfair to other Cabinet members , all of whom have to find their own accommodations in the capital . Last year Helms won passage for a measure that specifically bans the Secretary from soliciting or receiving property for an official residence .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
