NAKED AT THE FEAST by Lynn Haney Dodd , Mead ; 338 pages ; $17.95 <P> At eight , the St. Louis waif was farmed out as a servant . At 13 , after hanging around a local theater , she signed on to the vaudeville circuit and made two discoveries : she could hold a note , and she could hold an audience . <P> Josephine Baker parlayed that talent into a strange career . As Biographer Lynn Haney recounts , Baker badgered her way onto Broadway when she was 16 , but it was in Paris three years later that she found true recognition . As in a ' 30s melodrama , Baker 's professional life roared on while the person behind the spangles was racked with insecurity . The crucial difference between Baker and her Hollywood contemporaries was that the star was black , and consequently was barred from many roles in her native land . <P> So Josephine became La Bakaire and stayed on in Europe , a chanteuse who was , according to another expatriate named Ernest Hemingway , " the most sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In middle age , she turned from entertainment to graver concerns , working for the French Resistance and , later , speaking out against discrimination in the U.S. The tourist center on her Dordogne estate ran up debts of $400,000 . Still , she supported her twelve adopted children , a " rainbow tribe " of races , religions , nationalities . " If children can live together in harmony , " Baker announced , " grownups can too . " <P> The philosophy was ingenuous , but the spirit indomitable . After influencing two generations of singers , she was still performing in the U.S. , in Europe , in Israel . In 1975 , celebrating her 50 years in show business , Josephine , 68 , danced on a nightclub table until 3 a.m . Two days later she was dead . The official medical cause was cerebral hemorrhage . But a producer was probably more accurate when he said , " In my opinion , she died of joy . " It is a measure of Baker 's spirit that so much joy still reverberates in this belated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 115 pages ; $8.95 <P> Afflicted with long silences , they talk too volubly about their wounds . Long out of practice , they are uneasy on a date and uncomfortable when left alone . They are , in the words of TIME Contributor Richard Schickel , those middle-aged men who have suddenly been Singled Out . <P> In this refreshing manual , Schickel manages to avoid every classic bromide . The divorcee is not seen as muggee or neglected saint , older women are consistently praised , and the references to sex are free of cant and prurience : " There are still people in this world who like to think things over , and they often turn out to be very good people indeed ... If she does n't want to , she does n't want to . So be a good sport about it , for God 's sake . " <P> Schickel displays a fine mix of poignance and candor . He sifts through the fallout of his own 15-year marriage . Conclusions : children 's affection " is the love that endures forever , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as you can count on little else in this life . "
