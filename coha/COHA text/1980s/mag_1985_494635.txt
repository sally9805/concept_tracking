How the networks stole the party . Boss TUBE Tr WAS the night of the great American photo op . At 9 1 . p.m . Eastern Standard Time , IOU million viewers were arrested by the sight of the president , returning from the summit , in a " fly-by " of the Washington Monument and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials ? an electronic Mount Rushmore . At 9:06 Marine One landed on the Capitol 's East Plaza , four minutes behind schedule . By 9:14 the advance man 's plan had gone awry . Somewhere in the Capitol , the key performer had missed his cue . The call from the NBC bureau chief to the Capitol was insistent : " All three of our anchors are stretching . Let 's get him out there ! " The political clout of TV news emerged well before last week 's battle of the Burberrys in Geneva . The real " network takeover " occurred a generation ago . The scene : the 1968 Democratic Convention . At the podium , Senator Abe Ribicoff was attacking " Gestapo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , Mayor Richard Daley , the country 's last great political boss , gave his famous cut-em-off cue , running his thumb hard across his neck . But the cameras kept rolling . It was the picture that commanded us in our living rooms , not the mayor 's order . It was not some delegate on the floor calling the shots , but the network director high above in the control booth . And disastrous as that riot-torn convention was for Democratic Party politics , it made for electrifying television . The last futile effort by Daley marked a historic transition : the electronic net works had usurped the role of the political networks . Our system has n't been the same since . At a dizzying pace , ? the TV news networks have absorbed many of the democratic functions traditionally held by political parties : the elevation of key public issues , the promotion of new leaders , the division of executive and legislativ authority , and the constitution of political opposition . It was once the parties that ballyhooed the causes , touted the candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , based not on ideology but on a rational mix of " news judgment " and commercial savvy . For better or worse , the nation 's dogged two-party system has been challenged by a three-network system that runs at a much higher voltage and delivers at a speed approaching light itself . Even in the reign of the Great Communicator , there is one force that holds supreme power : the networks that carry him . Issues . At its most compelling , the evening news can capture a subject with an intensity that is irresistible . The Geneva spectacular was only the most recent example of the networks ' power to hype a story . We saw last year how a single piece can change the fate of an entire people . Imagine how much worse the horror would be on those dusty mounds in Ethiopia if NBC had not broadcast those first tapes borrowed from the BBC . The scenes of white policemen clubbing blacks , and that of uniformed riflemen arising from ambush to gun down rioting students , made constructive engagement indefensible . No American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addis Ababa or the leaders of the African National Congress , could tail to respond to this kind of televised punishment . This multi-megaton hype machine would have been scientific fantasy to the or time street political boss . Today a big-city ward leader is lucky to get his committeemen or precinct captains to attend a once-a-month meeting . Meanwhile , the networks own every living room in the ward seven days a week . In 1978 Walter Cronkite used this entree to play video diplomat , asking Anwar Sadat it he was ready to meet Begin in lerusalem . During the recent TWA hostage crisis , David I tartman woke us one morning with an exclusive one-on-one with Nabih Berri : " Anything for President Reagan this morning ? " When we returned from work at seven , Peter Jennings was there with an update on the politics of hostage-taking . At nine , we were bombarded with another network " leaflet drop " in the form of a prime-time bulletin . Then Ted Koppel put it all together for us at bedtime . We saw a parade of hostages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There has been no nonproliferation pact on such stories . Any zealot who has learned to nourish the networks ' appetite for these events has a power the constituents of Boss Tweed would have envied . Candidates . Some people say that Ronald Reagan created the part of TV-age politician ; actually he only won the part . It was created by the medium itself . In the pre-electronic age , candidates solicited support in retail fashion , one by one , neighborhood by neighborhood , and group by group . Along the way , loyalties would form . Personal relationships would evolve into organizations . The TV-age pol does it wholesale . He puts together the combination of look , style , and language that projects the right " profile . " Rather than waste time cultivating and extending strong personal ties , he focuses on projecting an appealing TV image . The tube , not the party , is his true mother . It it takes a staged " photo op , " let 's get it organized . It it takes trimming the comment to a 15-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goal is to get " good " at TV , because if you are not , you do n't get picked by the producers who assemble the morning and Sunday shows that count . This includes the best of them . In 1984 the figure of Senator Gary Hart leapt at us as if from the pages of an L. L. Bean catalog . Wearing a plaid shirt , jeans , and boots , he participated in a photo op by throwing an ax at a wooden target . The first time he missed . The network camera crews , looking for a better picture , went with his second attempt , which stuck . So did the image . Three days later he won New Hampshire . In one week his outdoorsy profile won him more evening news coverage than a year of pushing military reform and other new ideas . The Mondale strategy had been to limit the time between primaries , and thereby diminish the potential for such brushfire candidacies ' catching on . With their saturation coverage of Hart , the networks single-handedly thwarted Mondale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube taketh away . On Super Tuesday , at 10 EST , NBC led a special news program with pictures ? not from one of the two big primary states , where the Coloradan was rolling up huge wins , but from a downtown ballroom in Washington , D.C. , where Mon-dale 's strategists had cleverly stuffed as many paid staff and inside-the-Beltway associates as they could find . We were told it was a Mondale " victory party . " The picture did n't tell us that Hart won seven of nine contests that day . Nobody likes an early knockout , least of all the audience . Authority . Two hundred years ago , a convention of politicians meeting in l'hiladelphia set a delicate balance between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government . The television networks have placed their giant thumb on these scales . White House correspondents get on the air ten times more often than congressional correspondents . A stand-up near the North Portico , not a debate on the floor of Congress , is the prism through which the American people are shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at Vanderbilt University , political consultant Greg Schneiders recently reported that the amount of coverage given Congress in the five years ending 1985 is just half what it was in the five years earlier . In a break from this pattern , Peter Jennings anchored the seven o'clock news on November 21 from Capitol I fill . The president was coming . The seat of the federal government was assigned the same backdrop role as street-traffic scenes in Geneva . Later " Nightline " used the Senate Caucus Room for the same purpose , recruiting members of Congress as the studio audience . T HERE IS an obvious reason for all this . News execs want a sharp focus to a story . The president can provide it ; Ronald Reagan , particularly when arriving by helicopter , can fully exploit it . Congressional debate is not " visual " enough . It deals with ideas ; worse yet , with arcane topics that necessarily involve many points of view . Should tax revision emphasize equity or the maintenance of economic incentives or deficit reduction ? Not exactly the Achille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress , the main focus of republican government , is to argue why and if and how , and such topics simply do n't play with " New York . " Anyway , news deals with facts . Debate sounds too much like commentary ; they 've got their own people to do that . This executive-branch favoritism does not end at half past seven . It is now common for networks to give the president free airtime whenever he shows an interest in getting it . In the weeks before the 1982 midterm elections , White House aides asked to buy network time for the evening of October 13 to allow the president to deliver a political address on behalf of Republican congressional candidates . When the networks failed to provide the time ( they make more money from commercials than from political programming ) , it was announced that the president would " address the nation " that night . Only ABC refused to broadcast the message . At 7:30 p.m. the president delivered a bluntly political speech , which ended with the tag line " Stay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polls showed a sizable increase in party support in the days following the Reagan broadcast . The 25-minute broadcast amounted to a free-of-charge network contribution to the presidential slate . The opposition . This is the ultimate electronic coup . Having muted coverage of congressional floor debate ? " too many talking heads " is the verdict from New York ? the networks spot a growing viewer taste for something called " opinion . " To grab this audience , they seem hell-bent on simulating the give-and-take congressional deliberative process in their own studios . " Nightline " features main events like Falwell v. Jackson and Botha v. Tutu . " Commentary " segments break out like car chase scenes . In the evening , George Will lends a Tory dignity to " World News Tonight , " lambasting the New World 's " Little Englanders . " Bill Moyers pricks at the nation 's conscience like an anchor desk version of the senior Robert La Follette . John Chancellor steers the high middle course of the old New York Herald Tribune . To add grit to these polished tones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staid " Meet the Press " to show the mean streak in Reaganite populism . David Broder and Jack Germond appear on " Today " as aficionados of the ancient sport of " partisanship . " Sam Donaldson discards his reporter 's mike to challenge the defenders of power on " This Week with David Brinkley . " But the true , state-of-the-art voice of network " leadership " ? that 's what the ads call it ? speaks from the command deck itself . Just watch who CBS puts forth to rebut the president 's next controversial prime-time broadcast . If the pattern holds , it will not be Congress or the Democrats who respond , but its very own anchorman , Dan Rather . As the picture dissolves from president to anchor , the symbiosis of electrons and authority is complete . The executive speaks to the network . The network speaks back . President : Are you running for something ? Anchor : No , Mr. President , are you ?                 @ @ @ @
