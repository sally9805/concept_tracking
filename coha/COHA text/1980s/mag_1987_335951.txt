The burly , bullnecked defendant listened carefully as he was asked the most pivotal questions of the trial . <P> " Are you ' Ivan the Terrible ' ? " inquired Defense Lawyer John Gill . <P> " I never was and I am not Ivan the Terrible , " said John Demjanjuk in resonant bass tones . <P> " Did you ever kill anyone ? " <P> " Never , " he replied . " I ca n't even kill a chicken . " <P> After months of damning testimony against him , Demjanjuk , 67 , a retired Cleveland autoworker , last week took the stand in his own defense for the first time . Throughout four days of grueling examination in a Jerusalem courtroom , Demjanjuk never wavered from his claim that he is a victim of mistaken identity . Israeli prosecutors contend that he was the sadistic guard named Ivan who tended the gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp , where 850,000 Jews were slain . If convicted , he could be hanged under Israeli law . Demjanjuk was deported to Israel after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . <P> Demjanjuk stumbled repeatedly as a panel of three judges and a team of well-prepared Israeli prosecutors poked holes in his personal World War II chronology . He maintains that he was drafted into the Russian army in 1941 , was captured by the Germans in 1942 and served in German POW camps until 1944 , when he joined the anti-Soviet " Vlasov army " in Poland . Asked why he failed at first to tell U.S. authorities that he spent 18 months at a POW camp in Chelm , Poland , as he now insists , Demjanjuk said he forgot . When told that the Vlasov army had not been formed until months after he says he joined it , Demjanjuk pleaded , " Even here in Israel I do not know what month or date it is . " <P> As the trial headed into its sixth month , all of Israel remained captivated . The principal evidence against the accused is a photo identification card provided to the prosecution by the Soviet Union from its World War II archives . Made out in Demjanjuk 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , where Soviet prisoners were trained to be death-camp guards . The defense alleges that it is a forgery by the Soviet secret police , whose purpose is to embarrass anti-Soviet Ukrainians in the U.S. <P> But five Treblinka survivors have identified the man pictured on the ID card as Ivan , and several said they recognized Demjanjuk even now as their tormentor . " This is Ivan from the gas chambers , " exclaimed Eliahu Rosenberg at a February court session . " I saw those eyes , those murderous eyes . " Moreover , the prosecution has paraded a corps of experts to the witness stand to authenticate Demjanjuk 's signature on the card and attest that the paper and ink date from World War II . <P> Demjanjuk 's defense has not been helped by constant squabbling among his U.S. and Israeli lawyers . Nor have their tactics impressed the court . When Israeli Defense Attorney Yoram Sheftel argued that his client was the victim of a KGB conspiracy , he was interrupted by Judge Dalia Dorner . Said she : " All that I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , then you really have a very , very severe problem . "
