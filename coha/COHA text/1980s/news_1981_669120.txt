Both of these yields have to do with the third factor Mr. Maahs mentions when we get to Belmond : the people . Dave Nelson , who has wanted to farm since he was a baby ( like three generations of Nelsons before him ) , is responsible for that extra 18 bushels an acre . And no one but Chloe Jenison would think of giving a farm for an art museum. // Chloe Jenison is a former schoolteacher , and the 120 acres she lives on east of Belmond have been in her family for over 100 years . She has no children , and she wants the farm to stay intact . If negotiations go right , she will give the farm to the Belmond Arts Council , along with $75 , 000 to put up an art museum , which would be supported by renting the land out to farmers. // If it seems strange for a town of 2 , 506 to have an art museum , or for an art museum to grow corn and soybeans , that ' s because you haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that there ' s a bond between farming and art appreciation there , it ' s that life in Belmond is one of the most unified experiences available in the United States today . Everything in Belmond seems to be bonded to everything else . The Belmond Arts Council , whose annual Arts Festival , shows the paintings of off-duty farmers and accountants along with those of professional artists , is no exception . Marilyn Parks , director of the Iowa Arts Council , thinks Belmond is taking ' ' the sane way ' ' toward cultural activities . The kids who are in high school plays are also on the football team , she pointed out , and the owner of the local Ben Franklin Variety Store is one of the Belmond Arts Council ' s best organizers. // Dave Nelson puts it another way . He says that when he gets up in the morning and realizes he ' s 29 years old and will be farming for the rest of his life , ' ' It gives me a good feeling . I know where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a huge , still , black ocean . This particular land , or ' ' ground ' ' as it ' s affectionately called here , has a special hold on Belmonders . Farms are kept in families by shrewd fathers who put land in trust if they have daughters , so the husbands can ' t sell it off . Farmers fret over their sons ' marriages , afraid the land will go in divorce settlements . Well they might fret - it is some of the richest farmland in the world , and , at up to $4 , 000 an acre , some of the most expensive . ( Last year , Belmond farmland sold for $1 , 000 more per acre than the Iowa average . ) Nelson and his father and brothers are farming 1 , 400 acres together , sharing machinery and expenses as his father buys up land and gives it to his sons to escape inheritance taxes. // Even though Dave Nelson is a quarter of a million dollars in debt ( at least until he sells this year ' s crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' s at , ' ' he is happy . His land is prime , but the town of Belmond is also a big part of his sense of place . Like his neighbors who can ' t even see Belmond from their combines over the swell of the land , he has a strong affinity for the low , little town that has survived 125 years through Indian attacks , the depression , and a devastating tornado . They may live outside it , but Belmond is their home. // ' ' All these magazines that brag up farmers who get up at dawn and work ' til dusk , go to church on Sunday mornings , and live with the family the rest of the week ? That ' s a bunch of bull , ' ' says Nelson , who looks in every other way the part of the ' ' noble farmer ' ' - ruddy-faced , lean , blond , and quiet but straightforward . ' ' I ' m home maybe two nights a week . So what do I do the other nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got bowling every Thursday night , usually my wife and I go out once a week . Try to , anyway . . . . ' ' And there are church meetings , committee meetings , and school programs to fill any free time . Nelson thrives on this bustling social life , and so do his colleagues. // ' ' Some guys would kill if they couldn ' t get into town every day , ' ' says Nelson . The farmers have a good time in Belmond , and they pay it back . When they ' re asked , they give some of what they made off their land . Fund-raising drives regularly exceed their goals , and the town is dotted with little improvements : parks , shelters , baseball diamonds , a pool , and tennis courts , all put up by individual philanthropists or groups like the Jaycees using local funds. // But an art museum is something else again . Jim Caulkins , the canny arts organizer who runs the Ben Franklin store when not hustling up action for the Belmond Arts Festival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Chloe Jenison chose the arts council as beneficiary because it has ' ' moxie . ' ' In Belmond , that counts for a lot. // ' ' People say the tornado ( in 1966 ) was a terrible thing , ' ' says Sue Anders , a short woman with a habit of peeping brightly at you from under long bangs . She is president of the Belmond Arts Council and so excited about Belmond that you can hear exclamation points when she talks about it . ' ' The tornado wiped out all of Main Street , City Park , it took down huge trees , cut a swath through the center of town . People had to come together to dig out . But not one business moved ! If we can gather around and get things done after that , we can do anything ! ' ' The arts council is one of 38 civic organizations with that attitude. // To an outsider , Belmond has an eminently battened-down look . The rebuilt stores on Main Street huddle behind a single gray arcade faced with artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , white-plastic letters . This arcade is supported with I-beams on which perch identical white globe street lights . Other than the grain elevators , which shine like skyscrapers in the distance , there is not much here over one story high . If you are a stranger , you find your way around these nondescript , solid shops and dwellings by looking out to those elevators : the silver one is to the east , and the white one is to the west . Otherwise , it is hard to tell the difference between buildings . It is harder to imagine this sturdy but supremely unremarkable-looking town as the home of a new art museum. // That is , until you have seen Belmond by night . Then , all 2 , 506 Belmonders - farmers included - get busy . If they ' re not at a grandmothers club meeting , they ' re at the historical society , and if you don ' t catch up with them there , try the arts council . In the security of small towns , people don ' t feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave them open because people and their neighbors are always racing in and out of each other ' s houses with the minutes of their last meeting , plates of brownies , and telephone lists. // The activity could be dizzying , except that it ' s all so planned and orderly . It ' s as if people were still trying to tidy away the memory of those chaotic moments on Oct. 14 , 1966 , when the black cloud bore down on the town and the clocks stopped at 2 : 55 p. m . It is an awesome memory . Someone outside of town saw six or seven funnel clouds converge on Belmond . Six people were killed , a low toll considering that 20 minutes before the tornado hit the whole town had been on Main Street , watching the homecoming parade . One hundred and nine houses were demolished , 160 had major damage , and 75 of 112 businesses were also damaged or destroyed . One woman found , amid the rubble of her home , that a bed was still perfectly made , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be two pieces of artificial fruit that had been in a dish on her dining room table . ' ' The dish never did come home , ' ' she says in Belmond ' s ' ' Tornado Book , ' ' a collection of stories and horrifying pictures commemorating that day. // ' ' The first reaction was to get over the shock , ' ' says Ann Wilson , news editor of the Belmond Independent and arts council member . ' ' It happened on a Friday . Saturday , people kind of stood around , and Sunday people came in with rakes and chain saws . ' ' The town hasn ' t paused since. // Projects are completed , funds are found , deadlines are met . That ' s just the way it is in Belmond. // But even here , the Belmond Arts Council is something to be reckoned with . Jim Caulkins , who has a twinkle in his eye and a beard , talks as if he were sitting around a potbelly stove ; actually , he ' s figuring out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says Chloe Jenison offered them the farm ' ' because she thought we were the only ones that would have the moxie to do it . We ' ve done everything we wanted to do. . . . ' ' // ' ' We haven ' t backed off anything. ' ' said John Schneckloth , a soft-spoken man who looks so young Caulkins calls him ' ' John-boy ' ' and who throws pots when he isn ' t teaching art or putting in parking lots for the Jaycees. // It all started in 1977 when ' ' We said ' Hey , there ' s so much local interest and local talent , why don ' t we form an arts council ? ' ' ' This was no problem . Belmond has a talent for councils . They started planning their first arts festival that May and had it in June , with ' ' seed money ' ' from the Chamber of Commerce . Since then they have become a self-supporting tradition . Submissions have doubled , and the arts council was doing fine before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many meetings , Belmonders seem to have internalized Robert ' s Rules of Order . The night the arts council settled down around a plate of brownies in a comfortable living room to explain what they do , six people talked , but no one had to interrupt . Everyone had their say , jumping in and out of the stream of talk whenever their pet subject came up . From the sound of it , the arts festival works the same way. // The council invites three visiting artists a year ( sponsored by the Iowa Arts Council ) to put on workshops and then holds an art show under the new arcade . The state council screens the artists , the town council picks them and pays half the expense , but the relationship between councils is strictly voluntary , at Belmond ' s instigation . Workshops are attended , Belmond council members are proud to note , by anyone : grade-school children , grandparents , the local art teacher , and professional artists . ' ' The art teacher was just . . . ' ' Caulkins remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneckloth finishes for him . ' ' She hadn ' t had her work critiqued since she was in college. ' ' // ' ' We ' d like to see a lot more people in them ! ' ' Sue Anders says of the workshops . She paints and takes photographs when not working on the computer programming for her husband ' s firm . ' ' We really publicize them and we really push them. ' ' // Why ? // ' ' There ' s a lot of closet artistic people , ' ' Caulkins says . ' ' I guess that ' s part of it , you draw the people out. ' ' // ' ' It ' s just a way of growing ! You don ' t stagnate , ' ' says Mrs. Anders , stating a Belmond rule. // Almost everything in Belmond has been judged and ranked at the county seat or in Des Moines , and , like the corn and soybeans , is expected to grow . When you ask , for example , about the high school band , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Larry Flannagan , director of the Belmond Industrial Development Committee , says , ' ' We think we ' ve got one of the best industrial development groups in the state and we think we ' ve got one of the best arts councils , too . That ' s just typical of Belmond , everything that ' s done is just top-notch . ' ' His group just got Eaton Industries , a multibillion-dollar engine parts company , to build a valve plant here , bringing in 300 jobs. // They learn to be top-notch in school , where kids are encouraged to compare their standarized test scores to their performance the year before . Even when they ' re in the tenth percentile , the lowest . ' ' If they still gain those two points they feel like last year was really worth their effort , ' ' says Howard Dorman , high school guidance conselor . ' ' All the parents want their kids to have all the advantages they possible could . Sometimes it ' s a problem for our kids . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a job , and four or five classes . . . . Once they get out of high school , it ' s easy. ' ' // Belmond High School puts on two plays a year . When the Belmond High School Thespians are in high gear , they rehearse every night until 10 and Friday nights till 1 a. m . Every other year , they do a musical , which involves 150 kids . There are only 250 in the school. // The competition is with oneself and the rest of the state . Though artists compete for ribbons in the arts festival , there is no artistic snobbery , because the arts council is just there to get people to participate. // This attitude works very well for keeping the Jaycees busy and getting people to bake for bake sales . But all this old-fashioned Midwestern boosterism seems as if it would be death on that elitist , bad-humored thing known as talent - not to mention the development of the quirky , unteachable , untestable aesthetic sense that comes with it . But artists who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parks says artists sent by the state arts council seem to get a lot of ' ' nurturing ' ' in Belmond . A poet who taught a workshop at the Belmond Arts Festival wrote , ' ' I ' ve had a marvelous time , ' ' and stayed over to play in a pickup band with Mr. Caulkins . One painter is coming back again this year to teach without any prompting , he had so much fun last time . Artists who exhibit under the arcade on Main Street tell Mrs. Anders that though they sell in galleries , they love being on the sidewalk here , where people have no compunctions about walking up to them and saying ' ' How did you do that ? ' ' // The reaction was the same when Chloe Jenison began stapling rolls of canvas to the wall of her farmhouse and painting long , pageantlike scenes of American history and her own family ' s past . She found they were unconditionally welcome in town . The arts council hung them in store windows and the library for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knew then about her plans to give the farm away , nor did the Belmond Arts Council feel it had ' ' discovered ' ' a primitive artist . They just appreciated her for doing her paintings at all . In Belmond , participation is almost as shining a virtue as growth. // But the idea for some sort of museum had been on Miss Jenison ' s mind for years , probably since 1937 , when she took her mother to New England to visit a lighthouse her ancestors , Lucy and Miles Standish , had built . It was then that her interest in history was kindled . And after her parents died , she kept the farm . Though she rents the land out to farmers now , she still lives in the farmhouse , surrounded by mementos , stacks of paintings , needlework , and the four orphan cats she brought up herself . As she painted her historical works , she began dreaming up the idea of a home for her works , and a keeper for her land. // All of which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma . Nobody took Miss Jenison ' s offer seriously at first , but then her lawyer sent them a message that she ' d like to get on with it . They gulped and held a feasibility meeting. // ' ' We ' re an organization with a budget of probably $3 , 000 a year and all of a sudden you ' re talking about half a million dollars , ' ' said Schneckloth. // ' ' We talked about it in our meeting , ' ' Mrs. Anders said . ' ' It all boiled down to the fact that it was a chance to do something really great. . . . ' ' // ' ' Town our size could never get a chance again , ' ' said John Schneckloth. // ' ' And could we pass it up ? ' ' Anders said. // ' ' Could we say no and live with it the rest of our lives ? ' ' Schneckloth said. // ' ' And we decided , ' Well , we ' re going to try. ' ' ' said Anders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone jokingly told them they will have to earn the museum . After several tries , Miss Jenison has agreed on an architect ' s drawing . Her lawyer has drawn up an agreement for her to sign . The arts council feels she will sign it , but in the meantime , she has small disagreements , changes her mind , and keeps demanding the council get on with it . But they do keep getting on with it , with the moxie they ' re famous for . Ann Wilson visits Chloe Jenison every couple of weeks , and the rest of the time Miss Jenison calls arts council members daily to grill them about how they ' re doing. // She took me out to the farm with her one afternoon . It is a pretty piece of land that rises slightly and commands a view of the hill near Belmond that was used to scout for Indians . The barn , which Miss Jenison insists must be kept , along with the farmhouse , as part of the museum , is over a century old and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her things and talked about the doings of her ancestors in a voice filled with childlike wonder. // Her great-grandparents were on their way to Spirit Lake , Iowa , in 1856 when they were spotted from the hill . They stopped in Belmond for water and were talked into staying by settlers who needed help holding off Indians . After a balmy fall , they lived through the worst winter in Belmond ' s history . There have been Jenisons on that 120 acres ever since . Chloe was born a half a mile from the farmhouse . She herself has farmed the land , and has at various times raised sheep and hogs . She can remember sleeping in the barn at lambing time , huddling under a coat with her white collie dog at her feet. // She remembers hard times in the depression when they burned hay twists for fuel , and even  --  when prices plummeted far enough  --  corn . Even in good times it was hard work . They didn ' t have electricity or much farm machinery . She recalled her mother ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaver . I ' d start the dinner , and Pa ' d have to shovel off 50 bushels of corn in the dark . ' ' To keep the land in the family was a difficult , lifelong job and she ' s still proud of her parents . That ' s why she wants to give the land to someone else who respects it . Like other farmers , she has a possessive feeling about her ' ' ground , ' ' and doesn ' t want to see it sold or broken up , even though she has no children to give it to . When her parents died , she bought off the other heiress , a sister-in-law , because of Chester Luick . He was a town father who is fondly remembered for building a modern auditorium for the prodigious high school drama productions and a heated pool to keep kids from swimming in the river . He told her , ' ' You should keep the land , your father loved it so much . Buy that 40 ( acres ) south . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' I had been quite a saver , ' ' she says . Someone said to her father , ' ' That girl of yours beats all . The other girls spend their schoolteaching money on hats . ' ' She presses her lips together as only a schoolteacher can and nods to Ann Wilson. // ' ' You ' re getting Chloe ' s hats. ' ' // //
