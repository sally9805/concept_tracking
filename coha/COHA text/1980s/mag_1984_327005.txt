Two dozen volumes provide fresh glimpses of nature , art and faith <P> The work of Matisse is a carnival : of light , of warmth , of eros and of art itself . Matisse ( Rizzoli ; $95 ) is a celebration of the celebrator : a formidable , 752-page volume with 930 illustrations that took 14 years to prepare . Not a minute was wasted . The French master 's parabola is traced from early still lifes of glowing Oriental rooms and odalisques to the shimmering , heated imagery of dancers , to the paper cutouts and stained-glass windows executed when he was in his 80s . Pierre Schneider 's text echoes Matisse 's advice to his students : " Retain only what can not be seen . " What was invisible to the audience , the artist represented . What was unknown , his biographer-scholar has revealed . <P> Carpet knotting was introduced to India in the 15th century . The weaver 's art took root and quickly spread through the subcontinent . Masterpieces from Indian looms decorated the palaces of Mughal emperors but remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . The result : a profitable European market was opened , production increased to meet demand , and , inevitably , standards and quality declined . Erwin Gans-Ruedin 's Indian Carpets ( Rizzoli ; 318 pages ; $85 ) is a particolored object lesson in how art is overtaken by commerce . Carpets and rugs from the 16th and 17th centuries demonstrate an imagination all but forgotten in modern examples . An antique Agra is alive with a profusion of delicate figuring ; a new Agra is static and merely crowded . Inadvertently or not , Gans-Ruedin 's selections give the reader a chance to compare the finest rugs with the run of the mill . It is one 's best defense against a dealer 's trumped-up superlatives . <P> <P> It is hard to read Renoir : His Life , Art and <P> Letters ( Abrams ; 311 pages ; $67.50 ) . That is not the fault of Barbara Ehrlich White , a Renoir expert who has written a thorough and commendably lucid biography of the great French painter . The problem stems from the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy as it has to be to accommodate hundreds of sumptuous reproductions . They too , of course , distract attention from the text : voluptuous nudes , enchanted gardens , glittering portraits and skies filled to the brim with sunlight . Dedicated readers will learn that Renoir 's long life was not as serene and untroubled as the joy that shines from his canvases might suggest . That information is worth knowing , but examining these pictures is a greater reward . <P> " What interests me is a series of shocks and encounters a person can have , " confesses Sculptor George Segal . For nearly three decades , the master of plaster has recorded those seismic occasions , and in George Segal ( Rizzoli ; 379 pages ; $65 ) , Art Historians Sam Hunter and Don Hawthorne have gathered the best of them , from ' 50s paintings like Dead Chicken to his life-size casts of individuals trapped in time . Throughout his long career , the artist has trumpeted his message of alienation . <P> But seen in this gallery without walls , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust , for example . They display one attribute Segal has usually shown more obliquely : emotion . <P>
