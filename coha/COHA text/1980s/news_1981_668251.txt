Each morning he waits patiently until the shade comes to the cement front steps at the D Street housing project in South Boston . Then at 1 p.m. , James Joseph Gannon takes his aluminum beach chair and sits in the shade on the tiny porch and watches the traffic go by on West Broadway . He is 67 now and a retired longshoreman who is separated from his wife and living in the project with his 87-year-old mother . He has four grown children . Gannon says " it ' s no picnic " living in a housing project . The other afternoon the temperature hit 98 degrees and Gannon sat there . He has an Irish face , lean and slightly florid , and said he had lived in Southie all his life except for World War II when he served with the Army in the Pacific . He talked about unloading ships in the 100-degree heat in New Guinea . That was almost 40 years ago but to Jim Gannon , " it seems like last week . . . you never forget something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would respond to a question all right , but you would not call him a big talker . He gave up drinking about 10 years ago , doesn ' t see many of his longshoreman pals because " most of them are six feet under , " so he takes short walks and sits on the little porch and watches the traffic go by in the July heat . " There ' s not much to see , " he said , almost tohimself . The D Street project is all red brick and cement and scrubby weeds and an almost tangible feeling of depression . It ' s tough all right for most people living in housing projects , even in the summer when the living is supposed to be easy . Then Jim Gannon said something that I have heard a thousand times through the years : " Hey , I could write a book , the things I ' ve seen in the Army . Ya know ? " It must go with the Irish heritage , because way down deep we all seem to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper columns or something . I have heard that desire expressed a thousand times . Sometimes I can anticipate it coming midway in an interview . But then something happened that did surprise me , something I definitely did not anticipate . I thanked Gannon for his time and suggested he read today ' s Globe . Hell , if somebody was going to write about me , I would at least be curious to read what was written . People I interview almost always ask me when the story is going to be in the paper . But not James Joseph Gannon . He said matter-of-factly : " Nope , I never read The Globe . I ' m a Herald reader myself . Like the sports better . " So I came up once again with my usual sparkling repartee : a soft and tentative little " oh . " Later that afternoon I wandered around Southie and talked to Anthony and Marie Itri who also had lived there all their lives . They are a handsome couple in their early 60s and they relaxed on a lounge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Carsons Beach . They had brought their lunch and a radio and listened to semiclassical music . He is a retired mason and she is a Gavin school cafeteria worker . They have four children and Itri said , " Our baby is 27 years old now . " They were friendly and seemed like a very happy couple . And later at the L Street bath house there was manager Ed Rull and Joe Murphy passing the time of day . There were about 300 men taking in the sun , and Rull said they were doctors , lawyers and Indian chiefs . Everybody had a nice tan and Murphy said , " It would cost you a grand to get this tan down to Miami Beach . You can get it in a week here and it doesn ' t cost a dime . " Folks are worried that the budget cuts may close the L Street bath house and end an old Boston tradition . And later it was air-conditioned cool inside of Amrhein ' s Restaurant on West Broadway , which is a Southie gathering place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 98 degrees . So it was pleasant to sit there and look at the old James Michael Curley campaign poster and listen to the talk . My guess is that there were a lot of people present who some day want to write a book . They handle the words pretty well . But after a while I sat there and recalled retired longshoreman James Gannon sitting there alone in the shade on the front steps of the D Street project . I wondered what he thought about during those long hours .
