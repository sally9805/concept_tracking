 | MOST MISUNDERSTANDINGS about the place , I 'm pretty certain , stem from its size . A Delawarean named Mark Mathre told me the story , not apocryphal at all , about a crew from television 's " Candid Camera " show who set up a roadblock at the state line . They had no trouble persuading a number of motorists approaching from Pennsylvania that Delaware was closed for the day . The whole state of Delaware . Because it was filled up . " Of course , " Mark said , " any Delawareans coming home would have answered , We 've got reserved seats . ' " Whenever they do travel and tell others where they 're from , Delawareans risk being asked , " What state is that in ? " They were n't much surprised last summer when a national convention of police chiefs met in Delaware , and it came out that many delegates were expecting a trip to New England . And those who live here are still gracious enough to chuckle about " Delawhere ? " . " Just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a state . " If Mark 's request points up a staunch Delawarean pride , it also , I think , suggests that the nation 's second smallest state is somehow different , and special . DELAWARE is a state all right ? and the First State at that , having been the earliest to ratify the U. S. Constitution . But this predominantly rural enclave on the Delmarva Peninsula feels like a much more intimate domain . Only 96 miles long and at most 35 miles wide , it 's smaller than many U. S. counties . Its population barely exceeds 600,000 . Rhode Island , about half Delaware 's size , has 60 percent more people . Milwaukee has more people . This is a smalltown state , where peace , quiet , and good neighbors are surplus commodities .

Ironically , when Delaware goes big , it goes biggest : Half the U. S. fleet of C-5A Galaxies , the world 's largest airplane , is stationed in the capital at Dover Air Force Base ( pages 188-9 ) . E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company , the nation 's largest chemical firm , whose inventions include nylon and Teflon , took root here 181 years ago and directs its worldwide operations from Wilmington . Wilmington , Delaware 's largest city , is also a leading center of corporate law . More than half the top 500 U. S. companies and a third of the companies on the New York Stock Exchange are incorporated in Delaware , to take advantage of legal expertise and low yearly fees , though few of these firms keep headquarters here . But even with its skyline and expressways , Wilmington feels more like a town than a metropolis .

I 've also come to believe that everyone in Delaware knows everyone else . Irving S. Shapiro , Wilmington lawyer and retired chairman of Du Pont , supported my suspicions . " My operating premise in Delaware is that there are no secrets , " he laughed . " The grapevine works very effectively . " This closeness leads to some lively politics . Who but Delawareans could sustain a tradition like Return Day ? This occasion for celebration and wound binding is held the Thursday after Election Day in Georgetown in the southernmost county , Sussex . The custom lingers from an era when people had to travel to the county seat to hear election results . Today , winning and losing candidates come from all over the state to ride side by side in a parade of floats and marching National Geographic , August 1983  | bands . Victors have a grand time , and the defeated are scrutinized for grace . The governor , the U.

" The casual , congenial governor , whose style would delight writers of The Official Preppy Handbook , likes to brag about his state . In six years the budget has been balanced , short-term debt has vanished , personal income taxes have fallen , and the lowest state bond rating in the country has risen to more than respectable . How did Delaware do it ? " Very good bipartisan cooperation , " said Governor du Pont . " We all know each other , and if there 's a problem , we can bring the people and resources together to solve it . This is why I say Delaware is small enough to work . " DESPITE ITS SCALE , Delaware is far from homogeneous . The state began as a confederacy of three counties , and , to hear talk , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stacked from bottom to top ? descending in size and ascending in population ? are Sussex ( county seat Georgetown ) , Kent ( county seat Dover ) , and New Castle ( county seat Wilmington ) . For almost a hundred years they were known as the Lower Counties of @# Pennsylvania until Delaware gained complete independence just in time to join the declaration of freedom from England . But overlying county devotion is a more strident sectionalism . The world according to Delaware splits into Upstate and Downstate ? Above the Canal and Below the Canal . Debating the merits of the two regions is a treasured institution . The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal opened in 1829 to connect the two bays . World-faring ships sail this shortcut through New Castle County , no doubt unaware they are traversing a social demilitarized zone . " Our Mason-Dixon line , " said Bill Frank , a journalist who has covered the state for 60 years . " Delaware is a northern state with a southern exposure . And it 's a southern state with a northern exposure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race run by aspiring sophisticates who , on the whole , would rather be in Philadelphia ? and should be . Listen to Bill Collins , a dyed-in-the-wool Sussex Countian : " If I had my choice , we 'd ship everything above the canal back to Pennsylvania . " Upstaters seldom retaliate . It would n't be proper . They just aloofly acknowledge the quaintness of " slower " Delaware , and hope that while driving to the Sussex County beaches their cars wo n't stall in a town where the rural accent defies translation . The differences behind this hyperbole predate the canal , which , by accident , defined historic patterns of development . Delaware Bay became known to Europe  | in the early 1600s , and was named for Lord De La Warr , a governor of Virginia . The best nonmarshy coastal land was found around present-day Wilmington . Here Swedes introduced log cabins to the New World in 1638 when they built the first permanent settlement on the Christina River . The Dutch , who earlier lost a fort at the mouth of the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . The English bested both . Wilmington grew into a port of entry , welcoming Scotch-Irish in the 1700s and later Irish , Germans , Italians , and Poles . Quakers dominated the city 's early industries , flour and textile mills on Brandywine Creek . Upper New Castle County , today home to two-thirds of the state 's population , still leads in manufacturing . English planters , many with slaves , migrated from Maryland into Kent and Sussex Counties in the 18th century and sowed an enduring agricultural tradition . More than 50 percent of Delaware remains farmland , the largest percentage on the East Coast . Agriculture directly employs just 2 percent of the work force , but its earnings trail only manufacturing and tourism . AS A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT from Virginia , I plead diplomatic immunity in Delaware 's cross-canal feud . I began my explorations with language lessons from a native ? photographer Kevin Fleming . The town of Lewes , he taught me , is pronounced Lew-is . Leipsic is Lip-sick , and Newark must be distinctly New-ark , or you 'll be directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have ancestral ties here myself . Vessels , I heard time and again , is a " good Sussex County name . " I sought Delaware 's Vessels clan in Lewes , a quiet harbor town of 2,200 at the mouth National Geographic , August 1983 Delaware ? %  | of the bay and a terminus of the Delaware River pilots who yearly guide 3,000 cargo ships and oil tankers up the estuary to Wilmington , Philadelphia , and Camden . The first stranger I introduced myself to turned out to be one Jack Vessels . We have no proof of relationship yet , but in the spirit of Sussex hospitality took to calling each other cousin . A house restorer by trade , 42-year-old Jack was transforming a 1728 home into a visitors center . Lewes draws an increasing share of the tourists who leave 135 million dollars each year along Delaware 's Atlantic beaches . This expansive 25-mile-long coastline , more than half state parkland , seems to defy crowding , even when weekends lure as many as 90,000 sun seekers . Step beyond clusters of bodies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dunes work their magic for an audience of one . So many of the tourists are fleeing the @# sullen heat of Washington , D. C. , that the town of Rehoboth Beach calls itself the nation 's summer capital . Delaware 's beach communities ? indeed , the entire peninsula ? felt a sea change in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge retired the ferries . Ocean City , Maryland , just over the border , now mirrors Miami Beach . But the Delaware towns retain quiet profiles . MOSS WAGNER 's ice-cream parlor dominates summer nightlife in Bethany Beach ( winter population 330 ; summer population 12,000 ) . One restaurant acquired a liquor license last summer , and the town has taken the matter to court with the refrain , " We do n't want to be like Rehoboth Beach . " Rehoboth Beach , a conservative , churchgoing town ( winter pop . 1,730 ; summer , 50,000 ) , does n't want to be like Rehoboth Beach either .  | " We 've toughened our disturbing-thepeace laws and noise ordinance , and cracked down on group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to be a family town . We do n't mind singles , but we do n't want to be a swinging town . " Demographics being what they are , there are plenty of single tourists . Bars and restaurants cloned from Washington establishments do brisk summer trade . The Washington-born mayor understands these rites of summer . Rehoboth and its famed boardwalk have figured in every summer of Hughes 's life ; his parents built a beach house here in the late 1920s . " My friends and I used to have wild times , " he recalled . " But the town is less tolerant of high jinks now because this is home to more people . When my wife and I moved here permanently in 1964 , there was n't another person on our block that winter , and only a few stores stayed open . Now about 30 percent of the businesses go year round , and we have a better class of stores . " Retirees account for much of the population increase , a phenomenon felt throughout Sussex County as tourists who once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The county population jumped 2 2 percent in the past decade to 98,000-the largest growth in the state and almost double the national average . Greater job opportunities are also keeping native Sussex Countians home ? and luring them back ? after decades of brain drain . " It 's taken a lot of people by surprise that folks are interested in Sussex , " said Dick Carter , the county 's 35-year-old historical preservation planner . Sussex is hoping to attract small , quality manufacturing . " Agriculture is the backbone of the county 's economy , but we want to give our people choices , " he explained . " And we need more control over our destiny than rampant coastal development allows . I think our discovery by the outside world is going to be the dominant theme for the next generation , and we want to keep Sussex halfway decent . " This is the tightrope also walked by statelevel development planners . How to diversify the economy ? heavily dependent on chemicals , agriculture , and automobile assembly ? without sacrificing Delaware 's homegrown charms ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to build a refinery in southern New Castle County by creating the Coastal Zone Act , prohibiting new heavy industry along the coastline and the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal . " Unfortunately , the action was interpreted as meaning Delaware was n't interested in business growth , " said Nathan Hayward III , the energetic director of the Delaware Development Office . " We set out to change that image , and I think we 're doing the job . " The 1981 Financial Center Development Act broke new ground in this effort . It allows out-of-state banks to operate in Delaware , entices them to do so with tax incentives , and eliminates the ceiling on interest rates ; banks can charge what the market will bear . Twelve banks including Chase Manhattan , Citibank , and Chemical Bank have established subsidiaries . In another innovative move , the state has petitioned the U. S. Department of Commerce to establish a foreign trade zone in the Kent County town of Wyoming . Orangejuice concentrate would be imported from Brazil , processed in an old Wyoming cannery , then exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Delaware recycling its architectural past into a future . Overlooking Broad Creek in southwest Sussex County , the immaculate white houses , narrow streets , and tiny general store of Bethel create an illusion of a toy village come to life . The largest homes , built at the turn of the century , belonged to ship captains and ship carpenters . In those days Bethel prospered as a shipbuilding center , sending vessels down-creek to the Chesapeake Bay . A 1955 Delaware guidebook describes it as a ghostly , albeit charming , " forgotten backwater . " Still marvelously in the middle of nowhere , Bethel has been restored as a bedroom hamlet by people who want to retire or raise children in a rural setting , yet can take advantage of services and jobs in nearby Laurel or Seaford , where Du Pont operates the world 's largest nylon plant . George and Andi Martz moved here four years after George took a teaching job in Laurel .

" We did n't expect to stay , but the longer we did , the more we liked it . It 's not the social whirl of Wilmington , but I do n't have to worry when my daughter rides her bike down the street . It 's a very uncomplicated life . " Most of the hypnotic miles of farmland around Bethel , like 90 percent of Delaware 's tilled acreage , grow soybeans and corn . It 's chicken feed ; all but a fraction of the harvest nourishes broiler chickens ? 180 million of them last year ? which account for 55 percent of the state 's agricultural income . Delaware ranks eighth nationally in broiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Sussex . The modern poultry industry began here 60 years ago when Cecile Steele of Ocean View ( two miles inland from Bethany Beach and an ocean view ) hatched the simple but revolutionary idea of raising chickens as a year-round eating commodity , not merely as castoffs of the fresh-egg industry . Chicken growers today are foster parents to their flocks . Virtually all 1,200 of Delaware 's growers are under contract to one of  | the nine poultry companies on the Delmarva Peninsula . The company provides chicks and feed , then processes and markets the birds . The grower owns the chicken house and pays the electric bill . The house lights shine almost continuously to encourage gluttony as feed pans automatically refill . Chickens grow bigger and faster thanks to breeding , nutrition , and technology . The pioneering Mrs. Steele needed four months to raise a two-pound bird . Today Judy and Fletcher Webb of Ellendale can ship a seven-to-nine-pound roaster in 12 weeks . " We sold the dairy cows and went into the chicken business four years ago , " said Fletcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn . The Webbs raise 174,000 chickens a year in two 400-foot-long houses . We walked into one house and greeted thousands of Judy 's ten-week-old " babies. - " People tease me and ask if I 'm knittinz them bootees , " she said , walking among her chattering flock . I averted my eyes as visions of dinner crept to mind . " They do n't particularly care for Fletcher , " she confided , " but I talk to them all the time . I think that makes a better bird . " Maybe so . The Webbs ' contractor , Perdue Farms , named them 1982 roaster growers of the year . @#  | IN KENT COUNTY , just south of Dover , I found the center of the universe . It 's a quiet town , and I almost drove through without realizing I was there . What made me veer recklessly to the side of the road was the sight of a magnificent home and its outbuildings painted in shades of peach . It 's the mayor 's house , and the sign in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe around which the earth revolves . " " We call Magnolia that because our boundary is a circle , a symbol of brotherhood , " explained Shirley Huddleston Jarrell , a dynamo of a mayor who also teaches and raises a young son alone . She chose those arresting colors because her house was built by a wealthy peach grower at the turn of the century . A blight ended Delaware 's national dominance as a peach producer about that time , but orchards thrive again in the area today . " I find peaches and potatoes and such on my doorstep because people know I do n't farm , " Jarrell said of her town 's spirit . " My neighbors will wash my dishes or cut my grass during the day . We help each other out . You miss that in today 's time . " Whatever its position in the cosmos , Magnolia proved itself a force to be reckoned with when it challenged the U. S. Census  | Bureau . " The 1980 census counted only 197 people , " Jarrell said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to door and came up with 327 people . I could not believe they could n't count correctly in a circle half a mile wide . We would have lost a part of our federal revenue sharing , which is very important to us since we only take in $2,870 in property taxes . " A government recount raised the official tally to 283 , and the center of the universe kept its federal funds . THOSE 44 UNCOUNTED SOULS in Magnolia aside , Kent County 's population growth echoes that of Sussex . New housing widens the suburban spread around the historic capital of Dover . Since World War II , Dover Air Force Base and manufacturers like General Foods and ILC Dover ? where the Apollo space suits were built ? have lessened dependence on agriculture , though about half the county is still farmed . An Old Order Amish community of 235 families tills land west of Dover with horsedrawn plows . There is also a sizable Mennonite community , " more progressive in worldly ways , " Amish farmer Henry Byler told me . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of most of these Amish , came to Kent early in this century , not directly from Pennsylvania but from the Midwest , where they had migrated earlier . Byler shares his 105-acre farm outside Cheswold with his oldest child , 27-year-old Junior . But he worries about land for his younger sons . " Land 's getting so it 's not available , " he said . " One group went out to an area of Kentucky where land is not as expensive . It 's not as productive as this soil , but they manage . " East of Dover thousands of acres of federal and state wildlife refuges attract increasing numbers of Canada and snow geese that migrate each fall down the Atlantic flyway.  | Day breaks , and the V-line squadrons soar in mournful song and precision flight that make your heart ache to join them . And perhaps warn them about hunting blinds as they head inland to feed . " Thirty years ago , if you came home with a couple of geese , you had something to talk about , " one hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because our farms are now growing soybeans and corn , and mechanical harvesters leave a lot behind . " A knockdown goose-feather pillow fight seemed to be raging when I dropped by Alan Pleasanton 's picking shop in Leipsic during November hunting season . Hand a goose and $1.50 to Alan , and five minutes later it 's ready for cooking . His mechanical picking machine drums off feathers with rubber fingers . Six-year-old daughter Nan does her best to help . " Nan loves to gut , " said Alan , watching most of her arm disappear into a goose . " But you just know by the time she 's big enough to really help , she wo n't want to . " Bird picking begins the winter work cycle for Alan , a 32-year-old waterman of linebacker girth . Mid-December he starts trapping muskrats on 200 acres of marsh up the Leipsic River . February ice breakup on the Delaware Bay , 11 miles downriver , brings gillnetting for perch and rockfish , then shad and trout . April to November he sets pots for eels and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year round , weathering unpredictable productivity and prices . The oyster industry , once the lifeblood of Leipsic and other coastal towns , collapsed in the late 1950s when a parasite infested the bay . Seeding operations have helped , but " oysters look bleak , " as Alan told me . " Crabs and eels ? Seems I worked last summer for the hell of it . I 've had years I caught fewer , but I 'm getting prices of ten years ago with operating costs of today . Still , if you can scratch out any kind of living doing what you want , I say you 're ahead of most people . " Cross into upper New Castle County on bridges soaring above the canal , and the panorama foretells a different world . Smokestacks rise from the riverfront Getty Oil refinery , a Delmarva Power and Light generating station , and other plants mostly built before the Coastal Zone Act . The land has begun the slightest of rolls out of the coastal plain , so even the remaining farms take on a different cast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , largely in greater Wilmington and Newark ( New-ark , remember ) , home of the University of Delaware . The energy level quickens as you encounter expressways , the Port of Wilmington . and heavy industry , including two automobile plants , a steel mill , and the Amtrak repair yard for the Northeast . The chemical companies ? led by Du Pont , Hercules , and ICI Americas ? dominate manufacturing . Yet silence caresses the pastoral areas of northern Delaware , where narrow rollercoaster roads pass old stone houses , clapboard horse barns , and split-rail fences . This is land preserved by the wealthy , nicknamed Chateau Country for the estates owned , most noticeably , by du Ponts . THE DU PONT legacy in Delaware dates from 1802 , when French immigrant Eleuthere Irenee du Pont built a gunpowder mill on Brandywine Creek north of Wilmington . His father , Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours , did n't think much of the idea . Today explosives are just a pop in the company 's 33-billion-dollar annual sales . Du Pont launched a chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1930s it perfected Freon for refrigeration and invented nylon , the first totally manmade fiber . Orlon and Dacron followed . Add agrochemicals , plastics , pharmaceuticals , medical diagnostic equipment , and electronics . About 70 percent of Du Pont 's goods are based on petroleum products , so in 1981 it became an oil company as well , buying Conoco for 7.8 billion dollars . Although most Du Pont products are made out of state , their invention occurs mainly at the 147-acre Experimental Station near Wilmington . In her laboratory there , research associate Stephanie Kwolek handed me a jar labeled 1965 . What looked like opalescent nail polish was one of her earliest solutions used to spin Kevlar , a new generation of synthetic fiber five times stronger than an equal weight of steel . After a 15-year research @#  | effort by many scientists , Kwolek 's breakthrough occurred " unexpectedly , " she said modestly . A significant percent of the nation 's graduate-level chemists work in Delaware , but , with only a bachelor 's degree , Kwolek has earned 16 patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tire reinforcement , Kevlar has become the preferred material for bulletproof vests . Cables of Kevlar may soon anchor oil rigs , and the U. S. Army has ordered Kevlar-reinforced helmets . THE DU PONT COMPANY and the du Pont family are no longer synonymous . The 2,000 or so living descendants of Pierre Samuel du Pont ? their collective worth estimated to be at least 8.5 billion dollars ? live largely outside Delaware . Their interests are diverse , their wealth less concentrated . " The great period of du Pont family influence was 1910 to 1960 , " Delaware historian John A. Munroe told me as we played " what if ? " and tried to imagine Delaware without du Ponts . " I think the state would be both better and worse off today , " he said . " Certainly on the whole , worse . But some things might be better if the state had been forced to do them on its own . There 's still a tendency to think that rich people are going to take care of things . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings , they also helped push Delaware ? at times kicking and screaming ? into the 20th century . T. Coleman du Pont instigated and financed most of the first paved state-long highway that opened in 1924 . His cousin and political enemy , Alfred I. du Pont , mailed checks to the elderly from 1929 to 1931 while the state stalled in enacting a pension plan . Another cousin , Pierre S. du Pont , almost single-handedly modernized Delaware 's school system during the 1920s . Those three cousins had joined forces to keep the Du Pont Company from being sold outside of the family in 1902 , and their decision to build a 12-story headquarters in Wilmington brought new direction to the city . New blood and a building boom are surging into Wilmington today with the arrival of out-of-state banks . This corporate and chemical capital of America is putting money on becoming a financial center too . Anticipating banking expansion and new businesses lured by city tax incentives , developers are pushing new buildings into the skyline at an unprecedented rate . Hopes and plans are ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , which it resembles . The spirit is contagious . " Wilmington feels like a city waiting to happen , " observed one newcomer . " We 're watching a child being born , " echoed Don Callender , director of the city 's new Convention and Visitors Bureau . Now he and others are trying to figure out what to call this new baby . " We have an identity crisis , " he told me . " Chemical Capital ? Corporate Capital ? These images do n't conjure up all the reasons why you 'd want to come to Wilmington . " Nevertheless , visitors annually spend more than 200 million dollars in the city and surrounding New Castle County , touring museums and estates like Winterthur , where Henry Francis du Pont amassed the largest and most comprehensive collection of American furnishings . Residential downtown Wilmington has been rebounding during the past decade with renewed interest in urban living and restoration . Some of the renovation has occurred through urban homesteading , a program pioneered here in 1973 that spread across the country . One dollar buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and living in it at least three years . An innovative lease-purchase plan is helping lower income families become homeowners in new developments . Close-knit Italian and Polish communities withstood the turmoil of the 1960s when urban renewal razed blocks of black neighborhoods and Interstate 95 cut through the middle of the city . Wilmington , once an important center on the Underground Railroad , is more than 50 percent black . NESTLED in one of the poorer black communities that escaped the bulldozers , the Christina Cultural Arts Center has emerged to provide inexpensive , quality training for aspiring artists and anyone moved by Mozart , gospel , jazz , ballet , drama , or painting . Hundreds of  | students , mostly blacks , study here each year . Joseph Brumskill , the center 's director , sees that percentage changing . " People are just beginning to realize what we offer , " he said . " Our purpose is to take art to the whole community , but this must remain the place where blacks train and learn of their heritage because there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion designer , Brumskill volunteers his talents to create costumes for Opera Delaware . Its performing headquarters , the newly renovated 19th-century Grand Opera House , also houses the Delaware Symphony , whose season ticket sales have climbed from 700 to 5,000 since 1979 . That year marked the opening of the Delaware Theatre Company , the state 's first resident professional drama group . " The theater here has proved to be a wonderful social occasion that unites all types of people , " said Cleveland Morris , the company 's cofounder and artistic director . Perhaps , as Brumskill and Morris hope , arts can help harmonize racial relations in upper New Castle County . Five years ago school districts were merged to correct de facto segregation that had occurred as whites moved to the suburbs and left city schools almost 90 percent black . Privateschool enrollment rocketed . But now integration is beginning to take hold . Ironically , the first court order to admit black students to segregated white schools in the U. S. was directed at two New Castle County schools in 1952 . That ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led to the 1954 decision that separate but equal is not equal . ONE New Castle town actually integrated its school in 1952 . But I was n't surprised to learn that about Arden , where the first bumper sticker I saw read " Do n't just follow a leader , be one . " This garden town of 516 individualists northeast of Wilmington is one of the few planned utopian communities in the U. S. surviving , more or less , the way its founders intended . Arden was launched in 1900 by disciples of an economic philosophy called the single tax . All residential land is owned by three trustees who lease it to the residents . That rent is the only ? the single ?  | tax . The parks covering nearly 45 percent of the town are owned by all . " The single tax idea works for Arden , but it 's not an important issue today , " said Cy Liberman , chairman of the trustees .

" Imagine , " said Joan Ware Colgan , who grew up here , " even in 1963 my daughter came home from school crying because her teacher said Arden had been a nudist colony and hotbed of free love . " I found Arden 's spirits still free , but their activities should n't raise an eyebrow today .
