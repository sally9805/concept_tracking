When Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley appointed a special commission in April to come up with a new city ethics code , critics dismissed it as a face-saving device . After all , Bradley had just narrowly won re-election after a campaign that centered on his alleged ethical lapses  --  including his serving as a paid adviser to two banks that did business with the city . But last week the seven- member panel proved it was no rubber stamp . It proposed a code of conduct for city employees and elected officials that may be the most stringent in the country . <P> The code would outlaw all outside earned income , including honorariums , for decision-making officials . Former officials could not lobby city departments for one year after leaving the payroll , and would be permanently barred from acting as lobbyists or advocates on matters directly related to their government employment . Candidates for city office would be forbidden to raise campaign funds until nine months before an election , and partial public funding would be available for hopefuls who agreed to spending limits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern financial disclosure . Elected officials , high-ranking civil servants and candidates for city office would have to make public the exact amount of their income and investments , including their homes , and even list the names of their stockbrokers . Lobbyists who received more than $1,000 a year to influence city officials would have to disclose their transactions each quarter . Taken together , the proposed regulations could affect as many as 1,500 of Los Angeles ' 45,000 employees , as well as an undetermined number of lobbyists and candidates . <P> The panel urged creation of an independent watchdog agency with the power to impose civil fines of up to $5,000 , or as much as three times the amount involved in a violation . Keeping city officials aboveboard will not be cheap . The additional personnel , office space for housing the mountain of new disclosure forms , matching public campaign funds and mandatory ethics training for every city department are expected to cost between $2 million and $4 million a year . <P> Unlike the ethics and pay legislation passed by Congress earlier this month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside income with salary increases . This leads some critics to wonder whether many Angelenos , faced with relatively low city wages and the prospect of having to reveal their most intimate financial affairs , wo n't avoid public service if the code goes into effect . Says Michael Harmon , a professor of public administration at George Washington University : " The implicit message is one of distrust . "
