Old tags are for the dogs <P> First they start phasing out the classic Army Jeep in favor of a zippier modern vehicle . Now , if the Soldiers ' Data Tag Task Force at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis has its way , the G.I. 's stamped metal dog tag will be replaced by a plastic wafer that only a computer can read and only an engineer could love . <P> The prototype , developed by Datakey Inc. , located near Minneapolis , is about the same size as an old-fashioned dog tag . Saw-toothed on the edges and made of chocolate-colored plastic , it contains an embedded magnetic bit on which information about a soldier can be electronically recorded and , as needed , scanned by means of a portable microcomputer . Carrying the scanning device into the field , a medic could review a wounded soldier 's complete medical history before administering drugs ; a platoon leader might check out a soldier 's pay or disciplinary record . <P> The Army is vague about particulars : the tags could cost anywhere from $5 to $30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly in two years . <P> But the Army is apparently enthusiastic about the space-saving potential . " We 've got too much paper , " says Chris Occhialini , head of the task force , and too many " clerical personnel . " In a war , the Army needs to move medical and personnel information instantly . " Today we ca n't get it as fast as we 'd like , " says Occhialini . With the new , data-rich tags , each soldier in effect would carry his folders as he fights .
