Newswatch/Thomas Griffith <P> As Ronald Reagan 's first year in office ends , Washington 's political columnists , who like to be crisply assured in their opinions , find themselves baffled in assessing his performance . Consensus seems to be two cheers for Reagan , somewhat begrudged . Not so much cheers for his program or any adeptness in foreign policy , but for his capacity to stay personally popular and for his unexpected skill in having his way with Congress . " The applause from the audience at home and abroad has not been excessive , " Columnist James Reston concludes . <P> Oddly enough , liberal columnists are the ones who dwell most on Reagan 's likability , as if still in need of an explanation as to how he stole away their constituency . As Mary McGrory put it , " Everyone knows the phenomenon : the newly jobless auto worker who still wants to ' give Reagan a chance ' ; the bus driver who is hit by the cutback in school lunch programs but who admires Reagan 's stance against the Communists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march to the White House , Reagan , the hip-shooter , was often called to account . But as President , he is not . " Right-wing columnists , such as William Safire , William F. Buckley and George Will , treat Reagan 's likability as a useful sales tool , but seem to regard Reagan as too inattentive and superficial a student of the causes they espouse . Approval is somewhat sicklied over with condescension . <P> Reston of the New York Times has placed his rocking chair squarely in the center of the political spectrum . " The President is criticized for his amiable indifference , " Reston wrote , " but it may be our hope for the next three years of his presidency . " ( In the same column Reston just as spongily described Menachem Begin as a " wonderful but bad-tempered old man . " ) Columnists do have days like that . A week later Reston was back on firmer ground . He found consolation in an Administration that is " more moderate than its words . . . For when he is confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he switches . . . actually , Ronald Reagan is a very gabby but cautious man . He does n't have a world policy but a movie script . " <P> Columnist Joseph Kraft saw the Administration ending its first year " floundering in triumph . The reason is that the goals attained by the President were heavily ideological . Since the Reagan ideology bears scant relation to the real world , his successes make only slight progress on the true problems . " In foreign affairs , the globetrotting Kraft finds Washington " lagging behind events . . . Ronald Reagan came to the presidency with only a smattering of general , often incompatible , ideas about foreign policy . " The Administration is now subjected to " unkind cuts from friends all over the world " - from West Germany , Israel , Saudi Arabia and China . " First Washington needs to work out a concerted course of action for dealing with its worldwide problems . " But for the time being , Kraft lamely concludes : " When friends turn nasty , a good way to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hold for a spell . " Curious .
