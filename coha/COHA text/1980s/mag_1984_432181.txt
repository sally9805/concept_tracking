 | And so the road to L.A. forked rather dramatically , and the king and queen of the Games headed toward their distinct destinies . Carl Lewis played it safe ? much too safe , in the opinion of those who booed his decision to pass on four successive longjump attempts ? and did indeed reach his personal goal of four gold medals . In purely athletic terms , his performance was terrific ; as spectacles go , it was short on drama ? at least until the world record-toppling 4x100 relay on Saturday night . Mary Decker , on the other hand , finished her only event in the Coliseum infield , screaming in anger and agony , the tragic heroine of the 1984 Olympics . So now we can say about this Olympics what has been said about every other : it was the perfect 10 of times , it was the 4.6 of times . Although the organizers planned a tearful " Auld Lang Syne " for Sunday 's grand finale , no one left Los Angeles humming " Is That All There Is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dizzying denouement , spectators hauled battery-powered TV sets to the women 's hoops final so they could keep tabs on volleyball ? or caught a fleeting glimpse of the pole-vault preliminaries as they rushed off , clutching their Sam the Eagle seat cushions , to watch the boxing quarterfinals . " I Need One Closing Ceremony , " said the sign held aloft by a ticket seeker in j ampacked Exposition Park ; and the most natural response was , " So does everybody else ? and quickly , please . " Like Carl Lewis running in the 200 , the audience felt a bit drained by the Olympic experience as the Games stampeded to a stunning conclusion . Debate over Decker 's 3,000-meter race ( page 19 ) will afford these Games a kind of immortality that , given the pleasant but predictable atmosphere of L.A. , it might not @#  | otherwise have enjoyed . The comparisons to 1972 , when American hope Jim Ryun was run down in a 1,500-meter event , are easy but not always instructive . For one thing , Ryun 's demise came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight 's single most anticipated moment . But more important , Ryun was undone by an unknown Ghanaian , while Decker 's destiny was changed by a barefoot 18-year-old runner who was already the most controversial character on the Olympic stage . Zola Budd is from South Africa , a country disowned by the Olympic Family in 1970 . Her personal views on apartheid are unknown , but whatever they are , they are the property of the London newspaper that brought her to Great Britain and then hustled her through the citizenship process so she could run free ? and , not incidentally , lend her name to a regularly published " Olympic Diary . " She is fast , but she is also a front runner with little international experience . In the months leading up to their confrontation , Decker frequently said that it would be " interesting " to see how Budd handled the pressure and the heavy traffic . It was . As soon as the pistol sounded , Decker grabbed the lead and Budd settled into a spot just off the American 's right shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Budd made a somewhat tentative move for the lead and wound up hovering a dangerous half step in front of Decker . Contact occurred almost immediately . Budd looked distressed , but it was Mary who peeled off grotesquely and tumbled onto the grassy infield . " I do n't think there was any question that she was in the wrong , " Decker said after being carried off the track in the huge arms of her fiance , British discus thrower Richard Slaney . The officials at first agreed , and Budd ? who eventually finished a badly beaten seventh behind Romania 's Maricica Puica ? was disqualified under Federation Rule 141 ( " Any competitor jostling , running across or obstructing ... " ) . But 20 minutes later an appeals jury reversed the decision , and Decker 's gallant quest ended in the Official Bizzare Incident of the 1984 Games . Lewis , despite his complaints about the scheduling and a sore left leg , never seemed in danger of botching his carefully constructed plan . He won the 100-meter dash in 9.99 , the 200 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a leap of 28 feet one-quarter inch , then cruised home to victory as the anchorman in Saturday 's 4x 100 relay final . The only surprise was that he left with a somewhat tarnished image ; by passing on jumping turns and post-event interviews ? and by allowing his manager , Joe Douglas , to publicly drool over the prospect of the lucrative endorsement contracts ( page 25 ) ? Carl came off , in what was to have been his finest hour , as the ultimate Legend in His Own Mind . " He 's dug himself into a hole , " observed fellow jumper Larry @#  | Myricks . " He kind of stands off and tries to be different , like a celebrity . And now lots of people want to see him get beat . " But if Lewis was n't smothered with unbridled affection , it may have been because the spectators were already nursing pulled heartstrings . The victory-stand tears of 100-meter queen Evelyn Ashford were one reason , but so were the joyous smiles of such dark horses as 400-meter man Alonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brisco- Hooks , who set Olympic records at 400 meters ( 48.83 ) and 200 meters ( 21.81 ) , and as a member of the 4x400-meter relay team ( 3:18.29 ) . " I guess this proves you can come back from anything , even a baby , " said Brisco-Hooks , who was 40 pounds overweight after giving birth to her son , Alvin , two years ago . " But , really , I 'm still lifting my knees wrong , still learning how to compete . " The same could not be said for diving champion Greg Louganis , who reached a personal apex in the springboard competition , scoring more 9s and 10s than all his competitors combined . Said his coach , Rot O'Brien , " Greg is operating aclose to perfection as any athlete you 're bound to see a : the Games . " Perhaps , but the U.S. boxin team ( page 20 ) was almost aflawless ; 11 of its 12 member made it into the medal roundand in the end 9 , including th highly touted Mark Breland survived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal number of judging and coaching controversies ) to ' get the gold . But no one lorded over their rivals more ob1 : - ously than America 's basketball teams . The women , uncle : the quiet control of coach Pa : Head Summitt , overwhelmed their opponents by an averag ; victory margin of 32 pointduring the tournament and trounced South Korea 85-55 in their suspenseless final . Forward Cheryl Miller ? the USC junior who led the team in scoring , assists , rebounds and steals ? did everything but dunk . ( " I would have liked to have done it , " she said , " but the shot was n't there . " ) The men 's final promised to be ? and was ? so one-sided that a surprising number of seats at the L.A. Forum were empty as coach Bobby Knight directed his collection of college all-stars to a 96-65 victory over Spain . The highlight of the game occurred near the end of the first half when Knight , distressed by the play of guard Leon Wood , kicked a wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up splashing three LAOOC security guards . Or maybe the highlight was the postgame press conference in which Spanish coach Antonio Diaz-Miguel praised " the ability for colored players to play basketball " ? and then , struggling with an idiom , added , " It is clear as consomme soup that the U.S. is at least 50 years ahead of all other basketball programs . " But if the host country ungraciously dominated certain events , this was also the week that athletes from around the world weighed in with some of the Games ' most memorable performances . Zhou Jihong won China 's first-ever gold medal in women 's platform diving , beating out American favorites Michele Mitchell and Wendy Wyland . World-record holder Anisoara Cusmir Stanciu of Romania took the women 's @# @#  | long jump with a leap of 22 feet 10 inches . Yugoslavia edged the incredibly hunkish U.S. team in water polo . And fast-closing Joaquim Cruz of Brazil won the 800 meter ? the race of the meet , for hard-core track fans ? by beating Britain 's Sebastian Coe and America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one added more to the international flavor than decathlete Daley Thompson ( page 24 ) , the son of a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother who runs for Great @# @# Britain even though he 's been living lately in Southern California . Untroubled by the hot days and suddenly cool evenings , Thompson , 26 , ran away from rival Jurgen Hingsen of West Germany . He celebrated his victory by running the opening leg in the 4x 100-meter relay . As the Games wore on , the Olympic city became something less than the perfect place it had been in week one . One problem was that Angelenos , no longer able to resist the temptation , sneaked back into their Mercedeses and Ferraris , causing rushhour traffic to reach normally horrendous pre-Olympic levels . The ultimate crunch probably came on Wednesday , when the 92,000 spectators heading for the semifinal soccer matches met commuter traffic headon , causing congestion to spread from the Pasadena to the Santa Monica and San Diego freeways . This , in turn , helped bring back the pollution that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet journalists . As a first-stage smog alert went out ,  | mini-ambulances toured the venues , and indeed found oxygen in demand : several women on the Dutch field-hockey team had to stop playing because of debilitating chest pains , and six spectators at the Santa Anita equestrian events were felled by a combination of heat and hydrocarbons . But the natives were hardly restless . " I 'll vote for another Olympics , new bond issues for cops , anything to keep L.A. like this all the time , " said producer Barney Rosenzweig , who was able to keep shooting episodes of his CBS series " Cagney and Lacey " without interruption . The demand for tickets , morever , remained strong to the end ; the LAOOC announced in midweek that it had sold a record 4.5 million ? and seats for the closing ceremony went for $400 or more on the bullish black market . Souvenir seekers , meanwhile , were lining up before 6 each morning to buy " L. A. ' 84 " banners and stars-in-motion flags from a local manufacturer . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AAA Flag Co. owner Howard Furst . Homemaker Susan Yam had to agree . " I complained about the Olympics for 2 ? years , " she said . " No.y I 'm standing in line for a memento of something I never wanted to happen . " Another banner buyer , Julia Driscoll , worried aloud about having " postpartum depression after the Olympics . " There is already evidence that the L.A. Games will have a lasting impact on Amer-@#  | ica . Volleyball got hot as a result of the gold medal won by the U.S. men 's team and the silver won by the women 's ( box ) , and women 's long-distance running seems set to enjoy a new vogue in the wake of Joan Benoit 's stunning marathon victory ? and some gymnastics schools are reporting an unprecedented fall enrollment . " Our phones have n't stopped , " says Tom Cook , owner of the Atlanta school where bronze-medal @# gymnast Kathy Johnson trained for three years . Yes , it happens after every Olympics . But this time not all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half of the incoming class , says the director of another school , are boys , ages 8 to 10 , who 've been inspired by the graceful heroics of Mitch Gaylord , Bart Conner and Peter Vidmar . Youthful equestrians , too , have a spectacular U.S. team success to admire ? as have aspiring wrestlers , who watched 105/-pound Bobby Weaver of Rochester , N.Y. , parade his infant son around the Anaheim Convention Center in an ebullient victory march after his freestyle win . Some people , however , were a little too caught up in the excitement . Mark and Dave Schultz , brother teammates of Weaver , were officially accused of excessive brutality when both of their opponents had to be hospitalized after one evening 's matches . Mark , who broke the arm of Turkey 's Resit Karabacak , was eventually @#  | stripped of a victory for employing an illegal hold . " All we 're doing is fighting for position , " protested brother Dave . " We 're both Christians by faith and we more or less feel what happens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by steeplechase racer Henry Marsh , on the other hand , was entirely self-inflicted . Running with a virus , the American hopeful splashed through the last water hazard , then collapsed at the finish line and had to be taken from the track on a stretcher . The smiling steeplechase winner turned out to be Julius Korir of Kenya . Marsh was n't the only American track star who did n't perform as well as expected . Javelin thrower Tom Petranoff , the preOlympic favorite , failed to make the final cut in his event . The popular Willie Banks was sixth in the triple jump . But no one raised more eyebrows than 110-meter hurdler Greg Foster , suspecting a false-start , hesitated for a split second and got nipped at the wire by American outsider Roger Kingdom . In the end , though , the losers were gracious and , In their own way , as inspiring as anyone who got the gold . Watching high jumper Dwight Stones , a veteran of the ' 76 Games , come back at age 30 to place fourth was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several new Olympic events introduced in these Games . The baseball tournament , a demonstration event that was won by Japan , was well attended and entertaining ? as were the stiffly theatrical synchronized-swimming events dominated b Americans Candy Costie and Tracie Ruiz .

One pro ) ) , lem was that the ventilation system at UCLA 's Pauley Pavilion played havoc with the streamers the athletes use in their signature routine . The British delegation demanded action , but a high-ranking Olympic official responded by paraphrasing Avery Brundage : the air conditioning must remain on . she said , " We will not sweat . " Maybe that breakdown was a signal that it was indeed time for the Games to conclude . As the bumper sticker spotted on Wilshire Boulevard said : " Welcome to California ? Now Go Home .
