Sophocles wrote of an archer named Philoctetes , who was bitten by a serpent and whose wound would not heal . His countrymen were so discomforted by his injury and his anguished cries that they marooned the war hero on a desolate island . That is one way to deal with the suffering : remove them from sight . There are many like Philoctetes in America , citizens cast out from public consciousness because their medical problems seem too painful or costly to face . Among them : 37 million Americans who have no health insurance , a million young women too poor to provide adequate prenatal care for their unborn children , countless drug addicts turned away from treatment centers for lack of room , 73,000 victims of AIDS denied protection from discrimination . <P> Some policy analysts argue that , with an estimated $150 billion deficit this year , the U.S. can not afford to tend to such people . But the truest index of a society is how it provides for its most vulnerable members . At stake is America 's self-respect , the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community of civilized nations . <P> The next President should make a priority of health , particularly the fair distribution of health services . With the notable exception of Surgeon General C. Everett Koop 's commitment , this Administration has often gone no further in health care than bromides . Candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis declare that health care is high on their agendas , but neither one has offered a comprehensive approach to the issue . <P> This year 's enactment of catastrophic health insurance , the most dramatic expansion of Medicare since its inception , demonstrated that Washington can still respond creatively to a problem without busting the budget . There is a rightful consensus that expansion of the nation 's health-care system must largely pay for itself ; catastrophic health insurance will be paid for by premiums from those who stand to benefit . The program shows what commitment and ingenuity can produce , with the right leadership . <P> The first step in medical reform must be cost containment . Americans spent half a trillion public and private dollars on health care last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than double that of inflation and faster than in any other segment of the federal budget . By 1990 health-care costs will consume more than 12% of the nation 's GNP , further draining resources from defense , education and other vital federal programs . President Bush or President Dukakis will be greeted his first year in office with a Medicare bill of $101 billion . By the end of his first term , it will be $164 billion . By the end of his second term , a dizzying $250 billion .
