EPA gets critiqued ; Watt attacked ; a Commerce official probed <P> If governing is an imperfect art form at best , then Government bureaucrats are in a way consummate artists . Imperfection , of course , is a matter of degree . But last week , at three federal agencies , some choice examples of Imperfection 's art were on display . <P> Protect and Serve Troubles at the Environmental Protection Agency seem only to compound . Two internal reports came to light last week that are not likely to assuage public worries about how well the EPA is protecting the environment . One , commissioned two months ago , is an in-house EPA review of the $1.6 billion hazardous-waste cleanup program known as Superfund . Its conclusion : philosophical conflicts about bureaucratic strategies and efficiencies led to major problems . Infighting between headquarters and regional offices , said the report , effectively stopped the program from going forward . It cast official bickering over procedures and a preoccupation in Washington with saving money in terms of a classic bureaucratic foul-up . Stated the report : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has endured something more akin to management by hung jury . " <P> In addition , the study argued that a more realistic cost effectiveness would be achieved by using the Superfund as it was intended-for rapid cleanup of conditions threatening lives and health . Declared the report : " In sum , with control , not action , the watchword for Superfund , the regions and the program have suffered . " <P> The second EPA report summarized a probe of the work of a private testing firm responsible for evaluating the health and safety hazards of some 212 chemicals , primarily pesticides and herbicides , during the ' 70s . The study concluded that there had been a pattern of sloppy and fraudulent testing procedures by the firm , Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories , of Northbrook , Ill . <P> The agency subsequently ordered a review of all chemicals tested after EPA investigators in 1976 first discovered problems with the firm 's work . The Justice Department was then asked to investigate . Four former employees of Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories are currently on trial in Chicago 's federal district court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on four chemicals . Said an EPA spokesman in Washington : " We do n't want to frighten anybody . Many of these chemicals are supported by other tests . We 're trying to find out just which ones they are . " <P> Interior 's Wrong Designs The Interior Department , under feisty Ideologue James Watt , always seems to be in trouble with Congress . On Monday in Lynchburg , Va. , Secretary of the Interior Watt addressed the graduating class at Liberty Baptist College , founded by the Moral Majority 's Jerry Falwell . Said Watt : " We have seen government used by the enemies of liberty and freedom here in America , God 's chosen place . " But back in Washington , critics charged that Watt 's Interior Department was proving all too charitable , in a most unsaintly way , to private industry .
