Mr. Moulin later died in Nazi custody , as a result of his own suicide attempt , Mr. Barbie contends. // In the memoir and in tape-recorded interviews , the man identified as Mr. Barbie appears to admit to killings . The German voice on the tape recording says : " I went down to kill to Lyons with the French my own - my way . I have been ordered to fight the Resistance and these orders have been very strict .
