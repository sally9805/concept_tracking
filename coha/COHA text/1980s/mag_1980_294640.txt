A year after shortages , oil stock tanks are brimming <P> In Jackson Hole , Wyo. , near the entrance to Grand Teton National Park , a major tourist attraction for vacationing motorists , a merchant glanced out the window last week and smiled . " Normally the Winnebagos would be bumper to bumper this time of year , " she said . " But this year you can actually find a place to park . " <P> So far 1980 has not become a summer rerun of 1979 . Gone are the gas lines and also many of the gas-gulping trailers and campers once favored by vacationers . At Yellowstone National Park the number of visitors arriving by bus is up 32% , and those coming by bicycle , motorcycle and on foot have increased 117% . <P> The reason , of course , is the price of gasoline . Years of Government exhortations to conserve precious gasoline by switching to public transit , doubling up in car pools and even simply not driving did little to reduce fuel consumption . But expensive gas is having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer is $1.26 per gal , a 39 increase over last year . Total gas consumption fell 7% in the first 6 months of this year , while imports of foreign oil declined a strong 13.6% . Oil-company reserves two weeks ago stood at an alltime high for the season . Energy experts say that gas should remain plentiful through the summer and that there will be ample fuel oil this fall . <P> The lower U.S. consumption of gasoline is even holding down prices a little , at least for the moment . According to some Department of Energy officials , only half of U.S. gas stations are now charging the maximum legal price . Since late May , Mobil , Atlantic Richfield , Gulf and others have shaved 1 to 3 off their prices . Though 1960s-style gas wars are unlikely , some price competition is occurring among stations in close proximity to one another . <P> This year 's ample oil supplies , however , are uncomfortably reminiscent of the situation two years ago . In 1978 the major oil companies faced a temporary glut of crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage costs . But then the Iranian revolution quickly turned a winter of abundant energy into a summer of frightening shortages . <P> The Energy and Justice departments last week released separate reports that concluded that there was no conspiracy last year by the oil companies to create shortages and drive up prices . The Justice study determined that the service-station lines were due more than anything else to the Federal Government 's allocation system , which rationed scarce gasoline among dealers . The program was a bureaucratic nightmare that gave too much gas to some stations and too little to others . <P> But despite brimming storage tanks , the oil companies are buying all the crude that they can , even at $32 per bbl . Said one Exxon official : " There 's still a fear of being caught short if Iraq reduced production or Iran cut back more . We 're going to fill every bucket . " American oil reserves now amount to only a ten-week supply of imports at current consumption levels , and today 's ocean of oil could evaporate like a mirage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
