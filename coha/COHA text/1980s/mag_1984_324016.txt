A heroic story of survival <P> The 4-year-old boy with tousled blond hair and dark blue eyes sprints down hallways , pieces a puzzle , counts on his fingers and chats about ghosts . All quite normal in most children , but to Jimmy Tontlewicz these activities represent hard-won victories . On Jan. 15 , while sledding with his father , Jimmy plunged into the icy waters of Lake Michigan . When rescuers pulled him out , he had been submerged for at least 20 minutes and had no discernible heartbeat , pulse or breathing . In Chicago last week doctors said Jimmy is progressing so well that they hope to send him home this month . <P> Jimmy 's life was saved through a combination of technology and his body 's natural defense mechanisms . Prominent among these may be the so-called mammalian dive reflex , which allows whales and seals to remain submerged in cold water . It is theorized that humans also have this protection . The reflex is triggered when frigid water splashes over the forehead and nose ; nerves signal the brain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . An even more important defense against brain damage is a phenomenon known as sub mersion hypothermia : the extreme cold of the surrounding water , and of water breathed into the lungs , cools the body ( to about 85 F in Jimmy 's case ) , slowing down the metabolic rate and thus reducing the brain 's oxygen requirements . Says Pediatric Neurosurgeon David McLone , of Children 's Memorial Hospital : " Had he been warm , there would have been no chance . " <P> Increasingly , the lives of young near-victims of drowning in frigid water are being saved by techniques perfected over the past decade . Jimmy 's is almost a textbook example : fire-department paramedics at the scene of the accident immediately started cardiopulmonary resuscitation , fluids and drugs were given intravenously , and air was blown into his lungs repeatedly . At Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hospital , an emergency team labored over Jimmy for three hours . They used electric shock five times to restart his heart , put him on a respirator , and with heat lamps slowly warmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . <P> Jimmy was then transferred to Children 's Memorial , where doctors gave him massive doses of barbiturates to maintain his coma , a technique increasingly used in head-injury patients . Reason : the drugs reduce the brain 's need for oxygen and glucose and lessen the chance of swelling . <P> Nine days later Jimmy woke up . Recalls Pediatrician Paulette Harar at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago , where the boy has been since Feb. 28 : " He would lie on the bed sucking his thumb , curled up in a little ball . There commands like ' Sit up ' or Steadfast work with therapists has helped Jimmy regain control over movement , speech and thought . <P> The miracle recovery is not perfect . Doctors suspect that Jimmy had learning disabilities before the accident . They hope he will return to his previous abilities . " But , " says Dr. Harar , " ask me if he 'll ever read . Will he understand how d is different from b ? I do n't know . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
