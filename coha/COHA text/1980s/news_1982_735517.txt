txt The National Football League strike is over  --  too late for some and too soon for others  --  and the cliche that nobody ever wins such a dispute is much in currency . Do n't believe it . The owners won this one . The " system " they vowed to preserve survived an eight-week walkout intact . That 's the one that allows teams to engage in such anti-competitive practices as alOn Sports by Frederick C. Klein most-total revenue sharing , common college-player draft and scouting combines , while requiring the players to duke it out one at a time with management for salaries . It 's a nice system if you can get it . The owners also won financially . The widely broadcast price tag of $1.3 billion for a five-year contract is hokum . Anyone who bothers to ask the league is informed that the so-called payroll guarantees the owners agreed to , which make up the bulk of that figure , are a good deal less than they expect to spend anyway , given the continuation of past annual increases , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . The value of new or improved benefits in the players ' union contract  --  the usual economic measuring stick for such agreements  --  will come to about $250 million over five years . That breaks down to $60 million for the one-shot " bonuses " rangingfrom $10,000 to $60,000 that all players will get this year ( the union denounced these as " bribes " when management first proposed them ) , an estimated $100 million for a newly negotiated severance pay package , $30 million payboosts resulting from increases in and expansion of minimum-wage scales and $60 million improved pension and insurance benefits . The $250 million is n't trivial , but it 's not much , considering that it amounts to less than a quarter of the increase in television revenues the owners will receive under their new agreements with the networks , which cover the same years as the labor contract . Management won in the football labor talks mostly for the usual reasons : It had the resources to outlast the players . The average salary of $85,000 a year in the NFL is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young and npw to such wealth and many could n't provide adequately for a strike that could have cost them almost a full year 's pay. ; Part of the responsibility , though , should fall on the union 's leadership for wasting so much substance on the form of a new pact , when all or most of the members seem to want more money . The union 's insistence on , first , 55%. of all the league 's revenues , and , later , a ' ' 50% slice of its TV money was born of frustration over being out-snookered by management in past bargainings . Its demands for wages based mostly on seniority , a sharp departure from the star system that has long prevailed in pro sports , clearly went against the grain with some of its members . That the union stuck together through a strike that was longer than anyone expected was no small achievement , but it was undermined by the defection of a number of teams in the late going , and the threat of more . It seemed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept contract provisions it previously had rejected . The owners ' victory should be complete Sunday when the fans flock back to the stadiums and TV sets to watch NFL action resume . Baseball , where ticket demand is elastic , followed its 1981 strike year with record attendance this past season . No less can be expected of pro football . which sells almost all its tickets on a fullseason basis . Indeed , whatever drawbacks the new labor pact may hold for the owners may lie in the extent of their bargaining triumph . More than one NFL executive I 've spoken to in recent weeks quietly expressed concern that management bargainers were being too rough on the players , too intent on winning this particular round . Belatedly , it all stems from what Jim Finks , the veteran general manager of the Chicago Bears , calls the " growing adversary relationship " between NFL players and the teams they work for . " Between the union and individual player 's agents , we ( in top management ) have very little direct contact with our players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college with agents who tell them not to trust us , and now this strike has to reinforce that feeling . I hate to say it , but player loyalty has become so low it 's scary , and management has to bear some of the blame . "
