The level of play would not have ensured a winning season in a Mid-western high school league , but never mind that . The place to be three Saturdays ago , for football traditionalists who cared about history with a crust on it , was the Yale Bowl . Here in New Haven , Conn. , Harvard and Yale footballers played , somewhat haphazardly , for the 100th time . What they played , of course , was The Game . ( That Stanford and Cal call their annual collision The Big Game is , surely , an indication of desperate social insecurity . ) The two Ivy League schools met first in 1875 , fielding 15-man teams that played a kind of paleo-football . Harvard kicked four goals and won , 4-0 . The series was interrupted several times before the turn of the century , and war canceled The Games of 1917-18 and 1943-44 . <P> As the 100th Game approached , college sportswriters too young to shave knocked out misty-eyed pieces about Charley Brickley , the legendary Harvard dropkicker of the 1912-14 teams , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was murmured occasionally during this gentle rain of nostalgia that , although Yale led in the series , 54-37 ( there had been eight ties ) , its ' 83 warriors had underwhelmed eight opponents thus far and won only once . Harvard , with an upper-middling 5-2-2 record , loomed like a superteam . <P> A noodly sort of tension began to develop , especially after the Bulldogs caught an understandably inattentive Princeton team napping the week before the big 100th . It was not , to be sure , the sort of anticipation that had preceded the 1968 Game , toward which both teams had swaggered without a loss . The ' 68 astonishment still reverberates : Quarterback Brian Bowling , the model for Garry Trudeau 's B.D. in the Doonesbury comic strip , and big Calvin Hill , the star halfback who went on to play pro football for the Dallas Cowboys , led Yale to a 29-13 advantage with less than eleven minutes to go . Yalies in the crowd began waving their handkerchiefs at the Harvards across the field , in The Game 's customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a substitute quarterback , confounded probability and Yale by producing two touchdowns and a couple of two-point conversions in the last 42 seconds . Harvard proclaimed the 29-29 tie a victory . <P> Thus The Game had produced heroics before ; was it not possible now that Yale would arise from the sod and gnaw the Crimson ? Maybe , but it was clear even to an observer new to these rites that other matters were more important . Take the matter of the handkerchiefs . A society of pragmatists has decided that Kleenex is handier and more sanitary . The day when every gentleman carried two handkerchiefs is gone , as are most of the gentlemen . That seems to be the point . The old boys of the Eastern Establishment , waving in languid mockery at the foe , are also wigwagging a message to those of us plebes who are watching : " We still have our handkerchiefs and our standards , and do n't doubt for a minute that we still have our power too . " Handkerchief-waving is in the spirit of the Harvard cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " That 's all right , that 's okay . You 're going to work for us some day ! "
