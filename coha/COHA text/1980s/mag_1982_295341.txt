A new round of harassment <P> In the doublespeak jargon of Poland 's military bosses , it was called Operation Calm . The two-day police sweep , as described in the government press last week , netted 145,000 curfew violators and other petty miscreants . Out of that group , 99,000 were " warned , " 29,000 " lectured " and 7,000 fined on the spot . Some 3,900 people were hauled into police stations . <P> The stated purpose of the roundup was to test the effectiveness of the martial law rule , imposed on Dec. 13 by General Wojciech Jaruzelski . The result , admitted the national press agency PAP , was " not as good as it might be . " More direct was the U.S. State Department , which branded Operation Calm " a mockery of all recent Polish government statements to the effect that life is beginning to return to normal in Poland . " <P> In fact , Warsaw 's claims of normality were buffeted on several fronts last week . In the western city of Poznan , site of the bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesters were reportedly jailed after marching through the streets bearing leaflets proclaiming DEATH TO THE REDS . In a Warsaw streetcar , a police sergeant was gravely wounded when an unidentified attacker shot him in the stomach and fled . In addition , a number of minor bombings were reported . <P> Meanwhile , church-state relations seemed to be deteriorating rapidly . TIME has learned that Polish authorities may be contemplating the arrest of several Roman Catholic priests . An article in the party daily Trybuna Ludu accused some priests of involvement " in provocative and offensive political activity . " That criticism was echoed three days later in a Radio Warsaw broadcast that charged members of the Catholic clergy with acting " irresponsibly . " Specifically , they were criticized for spreading messages and " gossip " during their pastoral visits with the estimated 4,000 Solidarity union members and sympathizers who have been held in detention camps since the Dec. 13 crackdown . <P> After one such visit , a clergyman last week reported Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa to be in " perfect " mental health and " full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was allowed to meet with Walesa to arrange the baptism of his seventh child , Maria Victoria , born on Jan. 27 . Walesa , who is reportedly being held in a government guest house near Warsaw , said that he expected to be freed in time for the March 7 christening ceremony . He also gave the priest a brief note saying that all previous appeals attributed to him had been " provocatively fabricated . " Wrote Walesa : " My concept of struggle is different , and I will explain it after coming out . " Despite his dreams of a prompt release , that explanation may be long in coming .
