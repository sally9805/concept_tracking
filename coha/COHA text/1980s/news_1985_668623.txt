Bernard Epton likes to tell the story of a black woman who got on a bus he was riding . She looked at him quizzically and said , " I know you , don ' t I ? You ' re Clint Eastwood ? " " No , " Epton replied , " I ran for mayor . " " Oh yes , Epton , " the woman responded . " I knew you didn ' t have horns . " In fact , Epton tells many such stories , hoping that in their small way , they will help dispel the negative image he gained in his 1983 Republican campaign for mayor against Harold Washington . The point , Epton says , is that despite what was said and written about him in his campaign against Chicago ' s first serious black mayoral contender , he is still liked and respected by many blacks . " Most of them say pretty much the same , " Epton said . " ' Well , I voted for Mayor Washington , but I knew you were never as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , several have asked for autographs . Some black students have taken my picture . It has been reassuring to note that for the first time , many people felt that everything that the media portrayed wasn ' t the gospel . " The media . As Epton mulls over another stab at the mayor ' s office , his thoughts always drift back to the media . They are his obsession . As he sees it , the media took his respected career and permanently soiled it . Now , he admits , he is an embittered man . " After 62 years , I thought I had a reasonably good reputation and good record , only to find out from the media that I was a miserable racist s. o. b. , " he said in an interview in his Loop law office . Nearly two years after he lost to Washington by almost 40 , 000 votes  --  the closest a Republican had come to the mayor ' s office in 56 years  --  Epton has not lost his tart tongue , his self-deprecating wit or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisive and ugly political contests in Chicago . " You know , " he joked , " politics is a sickness . If I ever find a pill to cleanse my whole system , I ' ll buy the whole bottle . " Epton is undecided whether to seek the Republican nomination for mayor in 1987 . He sometimes seems to change his mind in mid-sentence . On one hand : " I would love to be mayor of Chicago , " he said , recalling phone calls from supporters imploring him to run . " Obviously , ego is every politician ' s Achilles ' heel , but I really think I could do something for Chicago , even if it were only for four years . " But on the other hand : " I have to evaluate my station in life , my financial status , my law firm and my family . If I had my druthers , I would much prefer at this time to be appointed ( to ) some commission that could be of some assistance in solving some of Chicago ' s problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run again . They see him as a flawed candidate who blew a unique chance to bring Republicans to power in an overwhelmingly Democratic town . His quick temper and intemperate remarks rankled many and , fairly or not , he is tarred with the image of a politician who tried to exploit racial fears for his gain . That image hounds Epton . Before the campaign , he was known as a moderate Republican who had spent 14 years in the legislature from an integrated district in Hyde Park . His private foundation gave to black causes , he marched in Memphis when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed and he sent his children to mostly black Hyde Park High School . How , he asked , could he be called a racist ? The reason , many believe , is that his strategists geared his campaign to appeal to white ethnics fearful of a black as mayor . His slogan  --  " Epton , before it ' s too late "  --  set the tone . Epton doesn ' t see it that way . The slogan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be his opponent and was twisted by the media . He said he went out of his way to keep race out of the campaign . " When I heard the examples of bigotry , I told them to drop dead , " he said . " Look at the record . I tried to defuse the racial issue time and time again . Maybe , I was naive . " After his defeat , he went to Florida and brooded . " I sat there for three weeks bitterly hating everyone , especially the media , " he said . His angry feelings have not abated . " Your colleagues made it very clear , " he told a reporter . " Good news doesn ' t sell papers . If they go ahead and blast an individual , it ' s a lot more newsworthy from the standpoint of getting ratings or selling papers than talking about the fine job that representative so-and-so or senator so-and-so did . " Time has softened some of the hard edges . Epton ' s decision to walk out on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " a mistake I would like to rectify . " His anger at fellow Jews for not backing him with the fervor blacks gave Washington has subsided and he renewed his contribution to the Jewish Federation last fall . And his evaluation of Washington is surprisingly mild . " I ' m not going to bum rap the mayor , " Epton said . " He ' s well intentioned . " Epton may be unsure of his political future , but his family remains politically active . His son-in-law , Owen Pulver , is the GOP committeeman in the 5th Ward . A son , Mark , has moved into the South Loop Printer ' s Row district and is contemplating running for office . Another son , Jeffrey , a leftist Democrat , is running for re-election to the city council in Ann Arbor , Mich. , and may run for mayor in 1987 . " If he wins this time , it ' s quite possible that in 1987 my son and I might both be running for mayor , in Ann Arbor and the City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Democratic ticket and one on the Republican ticket . Maybe I made a mistake of letting my children think for themselves . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Val Mazzenga . Though his political duel with Harold Washington for City Hall was heated and rancorous , Bernard Epton now refuses to " bum rap " the mayor , claiming instead that he is " well intentioned .
