She is an emigre actress renowned in Warsaw for roles in the classics . In New York City she shuffles around a decaying and almost bare tenement flat , hanging up tea bags to dry for reuse while intoning Lady Macbeth 's hand- washing scene in an odd singsong with a thick Polish accent . No one will hire her , and even she can hear herself and understand why . <P> He is an exiled writer , and his plight is , if anything , worse : audiences in his new country know next to nothing of the life he used to write about , and he knows next to nothing of the life familiar to them . To him , America is the Lower East Side of Manhattan plus the abstract , rectilinear shapes of the states on the map he stares at hour after hour . The story that this married couple tells is comic but grim : for the sake of freedom they have given up money , status , craft and identity . They are not only strangers in a strange land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a promised land for those who have nothing . For an artist , the promise may be a mirage . <P> Playwright Janusz Glowacki , 48 , understands these frustrations all too well . After his novel Give Us This Day , about the birth of Solidarity , was banned by the Polish censor in 1981 , Glowacki arrived in the U.S. as a virtual unknown . Hunting Cockroaches , which opened off-Broadway last week , transmutes his struggles into vibrant farce devoid of self-pity . During an emblematic sleepless night , as nightmare figures ranging from an immigration officer to condescending liberals pop out from beneath their bed , the pragmatic couple never complain of life 's unfairness . They accept having to prove themselves . They just wish it would not take so long . <P> Glowacki 's text , translated by Jadwiga Kosicka , benefits from lively staging by Arthur Penn and sensitive performances . Ron Silver bearishly evokes the descent from self-doubt to despair . Dianne Wiest ( an Oscar nominee for her role in Woody Allen 's Hannah and Her Sisters ) bubbles with fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says she will have a child ; she tells an enigmatic joke and vows to become a stand-up comic . Each gently deflects the other in a tender marriage , unharrowed by grief . <P> The title evokes in equal measure the mundane pests who scurry through the apartment and the character in Kafka 's Metamorphosis who arises one morning to find himself no longer a salesman but a bug . For this couple , each dawn is a reawakening to humiliation , each day a struggle to believe they can make an art as universal as Kafka 's . They speak of their homeland with attempted distaste : " In Eastern Europe , nobody has a sincere smile except drunks and informers . " They echo Poland 's subjugation : they yearn to be Russian refugees , who they believe are more in fashion , and wish they had Russian goods to sell . But in the most poignant scene they feel compelled to telephone someone , anyone , back home , just to ask how things are . After realizing that everyone they can think of has emigrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborator or retreated into paranoid fear of the state police , the wife sadly dials the number for the correct time  --  in Warsaw .
