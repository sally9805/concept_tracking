With this issue , TIME introduces a new section , one that will encompass numerous areas of human activity and focus them in a fresh , invigorating fashion . The title : Design . <P> " Form follows function " has been the anthem of much 20th century architecture and design , but it will be the function of the Design section to follow form-to trace its myriad varieties and analyze its influence on the way we live , work and play . The section will interpret , in the widest possible sense , the patterns and shapes of our world . Design , noted the celebrated architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe , includes everything from teacups to city planning . Accordingly , says Senior Editor William Ewald , who will edit the new section , " Design will deal with , say , the silhouette of a new telephone , with why the Susan B. Anthony dollar was doomed from the start , with eggcups , airports , flowerpots , type faces , shopping centers , shoehorns , bus seats and world 's fairs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of function , structure or goal , it will fall within the broad province of the section . <P> The writer of the Design section will be TIME Contributor Wolf Von Eckardt , 63 , former architecture and design critic of the Washington Post . Ever since fleeing Berlin as a political refugee in 1936 , Von Eckardt has been involved with the multifarious aspects of design as a typesetter , graphic designer , critic and author of such books as A Place to Live : The Crisis of the Cities ( 1968 ) and Back to the Drawing Board ! Planning Livable Cities ( 1979 ) . Von Eckardt was a recipient of one of the first Ford Foundation grants for writers in the arts , and is the holder of an American Institute of Architects medal for distinguished criticism of architecture . Two weeks ago he was in the noted " new town " of Tapiola , Finland , to receive the Tapiola medal for promoting the idea of well-designed planned communities . <P> Von Eckardt sees the new section as " taking a practical approach to design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more livable . " Noting the historical discrepancy between the vagaries of elitist taste and what people really want , Von Eckardt believes that " we have a right to say we like this and we do n't like that : we must participate more actively in the design of the world around us . The problems of living are not simply engineering problems . It makes sense to solve them artistically . " This week Von Eckardt assesses a novel Dutch idea for redesigning streets . In the process , he raises a vision that will be a touchstone of all the Design sections to come : the harmonious coexistence of man and machine .
