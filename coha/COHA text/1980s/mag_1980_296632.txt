PHILOSOPHY AND PUBLIC POLICY by Sidney Hook <P> Southern Illinois University <P> 288 pages ; $17.50 <P> In his seminars at New York University , Professor Sidney Hook often asked students to define Bertrand Russell 's beliefs . But no one could trap the gadfly who advocated the nuclear destruction of the U.S.S.R. , the condemnation of U.S. imperialism , the adoption of idealism , rationalism or realism . Concluded the professor : " Next time anyone asks you , ' What is Bertrand Russell 's philosophy ? , ' the correct answer is , ' What year , please ? ' " <P> When future seminars address themselves to Sidney Hook 's work , the correct response will require only one word change : Any year , please . As these 21 feisty essays demonstrate , over the past four decades the teacher-philosopher has seen no reason to alter his course . He did not need Alexander Solzhenitsyn to inform him of the Gulag ; back in the ' 30s Hook condemned the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany , nations whose politics employed " vicious ersatz theologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice have found Hook unchanged ; he has long advocated the rights of the victim : " When we read that a man whose speeding car had been stopped by a motorcycle policeman , who without a search warrant forced him to open his trunk that contained ... corpses ... walks out of court scot-free because the evidence is ruled inadmissible-we can only conclude that the law is an ass . " <P> Save for an early immersion in Marxism , Hook , 77 , has found his place outside of movements or situation ethics . For this perversity he has been attacked by Communists , religious dogmatists , reactionaries and the ' 60s New Left , who charged conspiracy when Richard Nixon ordered reprints of a Hook article decrying campus violence . " You can not bar other people from agreeing with you , " concluded the author , and went on attacking blighted authority wherever he found it-including the White House . <P> In fact , hypocrisy and its concomitant , special pleading , have always been Hook 's true btes noires : " The impassioned groups that shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' are unaware that they are calling for mob rule of which many of their forebears were victims . " Of reverse discrimination , Hook demands : " Would it be reasonable to contend that women should have been compensated for past discrimination against their maternal forebears by being given an extra vote or two ... ? " Nor is he indulgent to political philosophers- " those of us who are concerned with current issues ... we need only refer to Santayana 's apologias for Mussolini and Stalin , Heidegger 's support of Hitler , Sartre 's refusal to condemn the concentration-camp economy of the Soviet Union .
