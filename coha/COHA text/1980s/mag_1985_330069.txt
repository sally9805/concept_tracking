The author of dozens of books , Michael Moorcock , 45 , is a British writing machine who seems never to have been slowed by a rejection slip . He is aligned with the writers of science fiction 's so-called new wave , who have tried to merge futurism into the mainstream of modern literature . The Laughter of Carthage is a formidable example , a work in which science and technology are subordinated to narrative techniques not usually found in popular fiction . The style is better appreciated when the novel is considered as a continuation of Moorcock 's Byzantium Endures ( 1982 ) , a work of similar grand design that introduced the author 's crank hero , Maxim Arturovitch Pyatnitski . His opening line of the sequel : " I am one of the great inventors of my age . Rejected by its birthplace , my genius would otherwise be universally acknowledged . " <P> Both books are cast as Pyatnitski 's memoirs of a life uprooted by the Russian Revolution . He brags of his exploits as a Don Cossack ; he claims pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automobiles . But one can never be sure that anything Pyatnitski says is true . He is certainly an egomaniac and very likely mad ; he is also a reactionary Tom Swift , an anti-Semite , a sybarite and a paranoiac with a gargantuan appetite for cocaine . <P> Known simply as Pyat or cryptically as Pallenberg , Moorcock 's dubious hero was born on the first day of 1900 to a laundress and a " radical " father who stayed around just long enough to have his son circumcised . The mark of Abraham is Pyat 's secret shame and key to a mordant joke underlying The Laughter of Carthage . There is enough internal evidence ( allusions and outbursts of Yiddish ) to conclude that Pyatnitski 's gene pool is thoroughly integrated . Rabid anti-Semitism is his way of denying the past and advancing his career as scientist and gentleman . There is also ample indication of a thin line between deceit and self-delusion . <P> To sustain such a character for nearly 1,000 pages , Moorcock provides an exotic itinerary , a robust cast of opportunists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapades . Pyat 's first stop on his flight from Bolshevism is Istanbul , a teeming cosmopolis of thieves and whores but also a site idealized as the bastion of a once glorious Christendom . From there , the grotesque innocent moves west through Rome , Paris , New York City and Hollywood . <P> Movieland is the ideal roost for a young refugee with big ideas . " Do not listen to the envious and the insensate , " warns Pyat . " The illusion of Hollywood is thoroughly tangible . " Anything is possible with the Old World in ruins , and Pyat will try anything . He buys a 13-year-old prostitute and reinvents her as a lost soul mate from his Russian childhood ; he tours the U.S. as a lecturer for the Ku Klux Klan . <P> Moorcock takes large risks . An egomaniac with repugnant views is hard to take at great length . There is a predictable pattern to Pyat 's adventures as child of the century . But there are rewarding detours : Moorcock 's lush descriptions of landscapes and the world 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home in the novels of Dickens , Nabokov and Henry Miller .
