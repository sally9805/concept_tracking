txt " Man had innumerable chances but was  --  in the long run  --  insufficient to God 's purpose . He was insufficient ? to himself . " That theme is variously expressed in Bernard Malamud 's extraordinary fable , " God 's Grace " ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , 223 pages , $13.50 ) , which manages the rare feat of being a post-nuclear-holocaust story both somber and sometimes very funny . In that respect , it is matched only by two other remarkable stories , as different from it as from each other : Walter M. Miller , Jr . ' s " A Canticle for Leibowitz " and Russell Hoban 's " Riddley Walker . " Like those , it poses the question of who or what will be the successors to the self-destroyed culture , to which Mr. Malamud 's answer is much the most radical . The only human survivor of the brief global nuclear shootout is a certain Calvin Cohn ( a name to be carefully weighed ) , an admitted oversight of a God with much on His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific in a one-man sub , and surfaced to find a devastated planet . Like Job , in a direct dialogue with God , Cohn demands answers . God promises only that , because of His acknowledged error , " I will grant you time to compose yourself , make your peace . Therefore live quickly-7a few deep breaths and go your way . Beyond that lies nothing for you . These are my words . " Yet to Him in whose sight a thousand years are but as yesterday , " time to compose yourself , " to take " a few deep breaths , " is of uncertain duration . On the drifting oceanographic mother ship there is one other survivor , a chimpanzee that had belonged to a German colleague who had progressed from training the chimp in sign language to the beginning of something more . Cohn calls his initially frightened companion " Buz . " Soon their derelict ark grounds itself upon the shore of a large island and the narrative develops distant echoes , often witty , of inspirations as diverse as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson Crusoe , " Genesis and " The Tempest , " the varied allusive elements all undergoing a sea change into something rich and strange . A curious cast accumulates , drifting in from nowhere : first a group of other chimpanzees ; then a solitary , melancholy gorilla whom Cohn calls George ; a few baboons , and briefly an enigmatic seven-fingered being who may or may not be a Messenger of God . A " given " element of the fable , the ingenious explanations of it irrelevant here , is that first Buz , then the other chimps , can talk . Old . George , a good listener , is not heard from until the end . I became very fond of George , preferring gorillas by a wide margin to chimps . Cohn , an appealing figure , in living out his " few deep breaths , " begins to feel and hope that perhaps God has converted his mistake into a purpose . If mankind is gone , perhaps new creatures will have a stab at fulfilling His will . Cohn sets about creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , lapses and laughs in the central portions of the story as Cohn , mentor and lawgiver , elected " teacher-forlife " and " honorary chimpanzee , " tries to guide this " different world " of " different things " into paths he hopes may be wiser than those taken by mankind . He establishes the Schooltree , in whose branches the chimps and the ever-attentive lonesome George sit daily to hear Cohn instruct them in the cautionary history of the human race , with such of the knowledge it had amassed as he can remember , together with moral precepts and a celebration of language . " Cohn had at one time theorized that evolution might produce a moral explosion via a gifted creature , homo ethicalis ; but man , as he was , had got there first with a different kind of explosion . " Yet on his island , " it seemed to him that after a frightening period of incoherence , there was nowa breath of settled purpose in the universe . " Shunning the term " commandments " ? the more so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admonitions . " They include : " We have survived the end of the world ; therefore cherish life . Thou shalt not kill . " " God is not love , God is God . Remember Him . " " Lives as lives are equal in value but not ideas . Attend the Schooltree . " " Blessed are those who divide the fruit equally . " " Altruism is possible , if not probable . Keep trying . " Last : " Aspiration may improve natural selection . Chimpanzees may someday be better living beings than men were . There 's no hurry but keep it in mind . " Weighing the ever-difficult problem of how much to disclose , I can not conceal that the fable which , for a time , seems ebulliently hopefilled , abruptly clouds over . Aggressions more brutal than that of Cain against Abel break out . The animal world is not to be sentimentalized . Mr. Malaraud , whose mood had seemed hopeful , suddenly makes it clear that if the late great human race is to have successors , they too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't deny that from a highland of delight , as his reader , I found myself plunged into a chasm of depression that disappointed me sorely , making the title of the book , " God 's Grace , " and of its last chapter , " God 's Mercy , " seem harshly ironic . Jonathan Swift excoriated our kind as " the most pernicious race of little odious ver- ? min that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the face of the earth , " but at least kept his noble horses noble . A few hours of reflection and a re-reading of the end softened my reaction . There is a kind of painful majesty to his closing pages , with their inversion of the Abraham and Isaac story , also with their hint of Babel . In the last lhie , George , the gorilla , is the key to a hope , a grace , a mercy , not easy , not sentimental , not guaranteed , yet the stronger for its austerity . In the inventive , reflective , tragicomic , ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have created his most lasting work .
