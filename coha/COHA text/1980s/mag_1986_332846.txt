" Old habits die hard , " said John McEnroe last month . Not that he has n't tried to kill them off . The once supreme tennis star and undefeated champ of testiness on and off the court , McEnroe dropped out of the game six months ago , vowing to change his attitude  --  and his game  --  for the better . But when the reformed McEnroe made his long-awaited return to the pro circuit last week at the Volvo International tournament in Stratton Mountain , Vt. , some of his old habits surfaced again . <P> His running feud with the press herd had already been revived the week before , when he and Actress Tatum O'Neal were married in Oyster Bay , N.Y . McEnroe spit at a photographer a couple of days before the wedding and slipped into the church through dark curtains draped over the carport entrance . Give him points for trying , however . After the ceremony McEnroe and his wife waved , smiled and kissed for the crowds outside the church . <P> Two days later McEnroe failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled in for him . The next day McEnroe , working out with Jimmy Connors on a practice court , caught sight of British Photographer Tommy Hindley , who had tussled with him in the past . McEnroe let loose a couple of close-range volleys , one of which hit the photographer in the thigh , and , said Hindley , threatened to put the next one between his eyes . <P> When he went on sabbatical last January , McEnroe was , by his own admission , burned out . " I was going in a direction that was n't beneficial to tennis or myself , " he told New York Daily News Sports Columnist Mike Lupica . Two months before , he had nearly throttled a reporter at the Australian Open , where he lost in the quarterfinals after playing , as he put it , " like a dog . " Then he ignominiously lost his first-round match in the Masters Tournament in Madison Square Garden . Tatum was due to give birth to their child in May , and the father-to-be admitted that he " needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> So he and Tatum retreated to the Malibu house that they purchased last year from Johnny Carson ( price tag : $1.85 million and three hours of tennis lessons ) , enrolled in Lamaze childbirth class and awaited the baby 's arrival . Since Kevin 's birth May 23 , McEnroe has shared in the 3 a.m. feedings and even changed diapers . " I 've seen it with my own eyes , " says his mother Kay . Fatherhood , McEnroe says , has " changed things for me in the sense that your priorities change and you do things differently . . . It 's the best thing that 's ever happened to me . " <P> McEnroe began preparing for his return to the pro tour with a regimen of yoga and weight training . Aware of the odds against ever regaining the No. 1 spot he last held in 1984 , he has also started to work at a game for which he had never had to push himself before . " I 'm going to show my best tennis down the road , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that being in such great physical shape is going to help me mentally when things try to bother me on the court .
