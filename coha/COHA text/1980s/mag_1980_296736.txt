While President Carter and Senator Kennedy argue about what should be in the 1980 Democratic platform , they might find it useful to dust off and reconsider one long-forgotten document , the Democratic platform of 1976 . As is the case with most such creations , it promised many things to many people . Among the planks on which Carter stood four years ago : <P> &gt; " The current Republican Administration did not invent inept Government , but it has saddled the country with ineffective Government . . . We pledge a Government in which the new Democratic President will work closely with the leaders of the Congress on a regular , systematic basis so that the people can see the results of unity . . . <P> &gt; " We . . . will make every responsible effort to reduce adult unemployment to 3% within four years . . . <P> &gt; " Credit must be generally available at reasonable interest rates ... <P> &gt; " We pledge the Democratic Party to a complete overhaul of the present tax system . . . A responsible Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year with larger savings in the future . . . <P> &gt; " We pledge constant efforts to keep world monetary systems functioning properly . . . <P> &gt; " Fundamental welfare reform is necessary . . . <P> &gt; " We need a comprehensive national health system . . . <P> &gt; " We seek ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment . . . <P> &gt; " The Democratic Party is pledged to the development of America 's first national urban policy . . . <P> &gt; " The Democratic Party must provide leadership for a coordinated federal and state effort to strengthen the presently inadequate controls over the manufacture , assembly , distribution and possession of handguns . . . <P> - " We must break up organized-crime syndicates dealing in drugs . . . <P> &gt; " We will take whatever action is necessary to reorganize and revitalize our nation 's railroads . . . <P> - " We pledge to develop programs to make the family farm economically healthy again . . . <P> &gt; " The Democratic Party is committed to making the U.S. Postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic nuclear forces must provide a strong and credible deterrent . . . Our conventional forces must be strong enough to deter aggression . . . We believe we can reduce present defense spending by about $5 billion to $7 billion . . . <P> &gt; " The next Democratic Administration must and will initiate a new American foreign policy . Eight years of Nixon-Ford diplomacy have left our nation isolated abroad and divided at home . . . We must rely on the moral strength of our democratic values-the greatest inspiration to our friends and the attribute most feared by our enemies . "
