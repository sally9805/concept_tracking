People , not numbers , play baseball , the Dodgers proved again . What folly to explain the game 's latest outlandish finding in figures like the Oakland batting average and the Los Angeles ERA , when everyone who watched the World Series knows that Kirk Gibson and Orel Hershiser can not be explained any more than Mickey Hatcher can be believed . <P> To start things off , on consecutive nights in Los Angeles , something close to the ultimate hitter 's and pitcher 's daydreams were played out in such implausible detail that it strained decency . The A 's led in the ninth inning of the first game , 4-3 . Had there been one out instead of two , two on instead of one , that would have been enough . But the win-or-lose situation was perfectly framed , as that stubbly spirit Gibson emerged from the infirmary to take his only hack on crippled legs that said home run or nothing . On a 3-and- 2 pitch , naturally , the Dodgers won , 5-4 . <P> While less suspenseful , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hershiser 's 6-0 shutout was unsurprising . After topping off his Cy Young season with 59 scoreless innings  --  one more than Don Drysdale 's eternal streak  --  he had blanked the blankety-blank Mets in the playoffs . But against Oakland , the hits that Hershiser allowed were n't as astonishing as those he accumulated : three of them . No Series pitcher had given as good as he got since the Yankees ' Don Larsen went 0-for-2 in 1956 . Orel yielded three singles but took two doubles and a single back . Stretching the ridiculous was a pregame portrait of his Rockwellian mom and dad , the Little League Parents of the Year , tossing out first balls . <P> At home , Oakland won the third game , 2-1 , on a ninth-inning homer by Mark McGwire off Jay Howell . But a day later , Howell coerced McGwire into popping up with the bases loaded to save a 4-3 victory . The A 's started to get the picture . To assist in melodrama , a clutter of wounded Dodgers joined Gibson and Dr. Frank Jobe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall , Mike Scioscia and starting pitcher John Tudor , whose elbow gave out , maybe forever , after only four batters . <P> Mickey Hatcher homers , as likely as Walt Weiss errors , multiplied . In fact , the Series images are largely of Hatcher doing everything , throwing his ample body on bases as though they were hand grenades . " You do n't have to have all the talent in the world , " he said , " if the team plays together . " <P> Manager Tommy Lasorda 's prescience began with his use of Hatcher . Besides making a concert of the hit and run , Lasorda also let the A 's alumnus Mike Davis ( " a buck-ninety hitter , " as Dennis Eckersley moaned ) swing away in the fifth game on a 3-and-0 count  --  for a homer , of course . Wisest of all , he persisted with Hershiser in the treacherous moment of that last 5-2 victory , when the choirboy was so spooked he actually sang hymns . " Today I 'm living out the dream , " Hershiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking , wore glasses , had arms down to his knees and ended up playing in the majors. "
