The two skaters were inscribing energetic loops around the tidy patch of ice across from Calgary 's frumpy , circa 1911 city hall , playing hooky from classes at Mount Royal College . " It 's so nice and warm today , " says Christine Kilpatrick , 23 , flashing a smile that would melt half the snow in the province of Alberta . " It 's the friendliness that keeps the city warm , " adds Kimberly Palsson , 18 . Six hundred forty-seven thousand Calgarians , on the nervous verge of being discovered by a world ready to attend the XV Olympiad Winter Games , are determined to ladle on a downright cordial welcome . " Smile , you 're a tourist attraction " has become an unofficial local slogan . To a visitor , plunked down at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers 150 miles north of Montana , Calgary seems to have an unsophisticated , almost south-of-the-border Texas personality . The accent 's a little different , is all . <P> Oil wells operate within sight of the runways at Calgary International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete palm trees out front , a favorite drink is root-beer schnapps . And in what passes for subtlety , the two Olympic mascots , male and female bears , are named Howdy and Hidy . Get it ? First settled in 1875 by a band of men on horseback representing the North- West Mounted Police , Calgary today looks nearly brand new . Credit that to oil , which lies beneath the surrounding prairie in vast pools and has made a passel of folks as rich as the Ewings from Dallas . Of the 1,000 or so petroleum companies registered in Canada , 800 hang their Stetsons in Calgary . Block after block of antiseptic-looking office towers have popped out of the ground in the past 15 years , creating the illusion on a crisp February night of a skyline cut meticulously from cardboard . <P> Pickup trucks would have to be designated the city 's official vehicle , but the Mercedes dealer does just fine too . Though the oil business has been a tad slow lately , Edgar 's Lone Star Mercedes-Benz is Canada 's largest independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contemplating his spanking new showroom with 8,000 sq . ft. of black marble , Mike Edgar is a cockeyed optimist about the future  --  like most Calgarians . " We would n't have gone to this expense , bordering on decadence , " he says , " if we thought the business was going to be dicey , or even questionable . " <P> On a Saturday afternoon there are more pickups than Mercedes in the dirt parking lot at Ranchman 's ( " Canada 's Greatest Honky Tonk ! ! " ) . Inside , there are more cowboy hats than cowboys . But there is an aura of at least the ' 80s Wild Wild West . Tucked in a corner behind the Gunsmoke video game is Punchball , a device resembling a prizefighter 's speed bag . For a quarter you can haul off and smash the bag while a meter registers the force of the blow . Splotches of dried blood on the leather indicate that some cowpokes have broken their hands trying to impress that cute little filly from down the road in Medicine Hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys who calls Ranchman 's home , can readily separate a fellow cowboy out of the herd of lawyers , accountants and truck drivers . " You come in here on Saturday at midnight , " he says with amused tolerance , " and just imagine how many lies are being told . "
