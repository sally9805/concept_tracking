Only a few months ago , the British government turned to Kuwait as a savior . Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's grand privatization plan , the government had been ready last October to sell its 32% stake in British Petroleum to the public . Then stock markets around the world crashed . Since the BP shares had been priced far above their postcollapse market value , it seemed certain that few investors would buy them . Enter the Kuwait Investment Office , the London-based agency of Kuwait 's Finance Ministry that handles the bulk of the Arab country 's overseas holdings . Beginning in early November , the Kuwaitis started to buy BP stock in large amounts and singlehandedly salvaged the offering . <P> These days , though , 10 Downing Street must be wondering if the Kuwait Investment Office is friend or foe . Reason : the Kuwaitis are still buying BP shares  --  with an enthusiasm that has raised suspicions in Britain . Kuwait has spent some $1.9 billion , bringing its stake in British Petroleum up to 22% , to become BP 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat on BP 's board . They initially promised not to raise their stake above 22.5% , but Fauad Jaffar , deputy chairman of KIO , seemed to waffle on that pledge during a recent television interview . Said he : " If the situation changes , obviously any investor must have an open mind . " <P> Was that a veiled takeover threat ? Probably not , since the Kuwaitis know that the British government could thwart any foreign bid for control of BP by simply ruling that such a sale would be against the public interest . BP executives are nonetheless distressed at the size of Kuwait 's stake in the company : not only could the Kuwaitis easily change their minds about seeking a role in management but they could also sell their stock to any corporate raider interested in BP . <P> Neil Kinnock , the leader of the opposition Labor Party , last week challenged Thatcher 's decision to go along with Kuwait 's investment , noting the Prime Minister 's statement three months ago that the Kuwaitis had assured Britain they " had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management role . " The Labor leader questioned how binding those assurances really were . Said he : " This is obviously a matter of public interest and concern . " <P> Kuwait 's BP stock is the latest addition to one of the world 's most diversified investment portfolios . Unlike Saudi Arabia , which has poured many of its petrodollars into grand domestic projects , Kuwait has invested most of its income overseas . The country holds $85 billion worth of stocks , bonds and real estate in the U.S. and Europe . Kuwait 's overseas holdings provided a comfortable cushion when petroleum prices collapsed two years ago ; in fact , the country earns more from investments than from oil exports . <P> In the U.S. , the Kuwaitis own Santa Fe International , a leading oil-drilling company ; the Atlanta Hilton hotel ; and a controlling interest in the Dallas Galleria , a glittering complex of shops , offices and a hotel . The Kuwaitis are more visible in Europe . They own billions of dollars worth of British stocks , including 15% of the Royal Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel chain . On the Continent , Kuwait has invested more than $2 billion in Spanish companies . In West Germany , Kuwait owns 20% of Metallgesellschaft , a mining , metals and plastics company , and 14% of Daimler- Benz , the car manufacturer .
