According to the Cubans , President Belisario Betancur of Colombia and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain have proposed that those wounded able to travel , and the bodies of the dead , be flown back to Cuba . Other Cubans , along with Grenadians who are afraid to remain in the country , could be taken to Cuba by ship . <> <> There are still no official Cuban casualty figures , but informed diplomatic sources here said about 100 of the 600 Cuban prisoners are wounded and that 100 Cubans are missing . Among the missing , the number of dead is believed to be low. // The United States invasion of Grenada has presented Cuba with its most serious diplomatic crisis in years , according to diplomats from both Western and Communist countries . The invasion and events following it , diplomats say , raise questions about Cuba ' s future influence in the Caribbean and Central America. // On Tuesday , the day of the invasion , the leftist Government of Suriname asked the Cuban Ambassador to leave . The Cubans had cultivated friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Desi Bouterse. // Diplomats point out that President Fidel Castro , at a news conference Tuesday night , said that if Nicaragua were to face an invasion similar to the one in Grenada , Cuba would not be able to help in the face of such a superior armed force. // " That ' s reality , " Mr. Castro said . " It ' s not our option to be able to do it . " <> <> " Castro is isolated and vulnerable , " a Western diplomat said . " He ' s lost Grenada . He ' s been thrown out of Suriname . And he has admitted he can ' t help Nicaragua. " // Western and other diplomats here say they believe that Cuba ' s commitment to lend military assistance to Nicaragua stops short of the point at which it would bring direct conflict with the United States. // The arrangement with Nicaragua is believed by diplomatic observers here to be roughly parallel to Cuba ' s own defense arrangement with the Soviet Union , which would also like to avoid direct conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , which has been pressing diplomats here to ask their governments to condemn the invasion , called in members of the diplomatic corps and passed out copies of a note they received Wednesday morning from Kenneth N. Skoug Jr , the director of the Office of Cuban Affairs in the State Department. // The Spanish translation of that note , provided by the Cubans , said : " As we have told the Cubans from the beginning , we have taken fully into account a desire to secure the safety of Cuban personnel on the island . There would have been no problem in the first place between us if the Cubans in Grenada had not fired first against our forces. " // The Cubans provided the main armed resistance in Grenada . <> <> ' Time Is Essential ' The note went on to say that the United States was willing to talk with the leader of the Cuban forces , as the Cubans had suggested , " but we don ' t know who he is. " // " If he will identify himself to us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by the repatriation of Cubans , even armed ones , in Grenada. " // " Time is essential if lives are to be saved , " the note continued . " United States operations will continue until the resistance stops. " // " As far as Cuban personnel actually under the custody of the forces of the Eastern Caribbean states , we understand that these are being taken to Barbados , where it will be up to the Government of Cuba to repatriate them to Cuba , " the note said. // The oral response to the American note , Western sources said , was negative . Susequently , Spain and Colombia offered to mediate. // The contents of the note were made public by the Government Wednesday evening . Western officials here speculated that the Government hoped to minimize any concern among Cubans that they , too , may be in danger of an invasion by the United States . In the past , Mr. Castro has warned many times of the possibility of a United States invasion , but he made no such warnings this week. // Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cubans on Grenada , and interviews with their anxious families have been published and telecast . But Mr. Castro ' s news conference and subsequent Government statements have been more moderate in tone than in such previous crises as the Mariel boatlift in 1980 , in which thousands of discontented Cubans went to the United States. // In spite of his initial characterizaton of the United States as reckless and warmongering , and his threats Tuesday night that Cubans would fight to the death in Grenada , Mr. Castro ' s disclosure of the American note , expressing as it does a concern on the part of the United States to avoid confrontation with or injury to Cubans , seemed to reflect a more moderate stand. // There are few signs of military preparations here . At the end of last year Mr. Castro said the Soviet Union had delivered nearly all the arms promised to Cuba for the years 1981 to 1985. // Cuba has increased its home defense with a territorial militia . A target strength of 500 , 000 was reached by mid- 1981 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million , according to sources here . He reportedly said 75 percent of the new recruits would be women . <> <> Cubans Are Kept Informed // The Cuban Government has been reporting to the public on the situation in Grenada with a series of bulletins . On Wednesday the Government said that its embassy had lost contact with Cubans in defensive positions and that Cuban forces were under attack by planes , helicopters , heavy artillery and mortars . A group of six Cubans , it said , had died holding the flag in their arms. // There is little concrete information in Havana about the military coup in Grenada , but both Western and Communist diplomatic observers said they believed that the Cubans played no role in the overthrow of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and were outraged at his execution . At a meeting of the Politburo after the execution , these sources said , there were those who argued strenuously that Cuba should break diplomatic relations. // Although this was not done , a statement by the Cuban Government on Oct. 20 said , " No doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division justifies atrocious actions such as the physical elimination of Bishop and the outstanding group of honest and worthy leaders who died yesterday. " // " The death of Bishop and his comrades should be clarified , " the statement said , " and if they were executed in cold blood , the guilty deserve to be severely punished. " // //
