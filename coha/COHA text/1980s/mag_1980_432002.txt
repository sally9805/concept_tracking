 | I am a member of the black middle class who has had it with being patted on the head by white hands and slapped in the face by black hands for my success . Here 's a discovery that too many people still find startling : when given equal opportunities at white-collar pencil pushing , blacks want the same things from life that everyone else wants . These include the proverbial dream house , two cars , an aboveaverage school and a vacation for the kids at Disneyland . We may , in fact , want these things more than other Americans because most of us have been denied them so long . Meanwhile , a considerable number of the folks we left behind in the " old country , " commonly called the ghetto , and the militants we left behind in their antiquated ideology ca n't berate middle-class blacks enough for " forgetting where we came from . " We have forsaken the revolution , we are told , we have sold out . We are Oreos , they say , black on the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forgotten ; we would not dare . We are simply fighting on different fronts and are no less war weary , and possibly more heartbroken , for we know the black and white worlds can meld , that there can be a better world . It is impossible for me to forget where I came from as long as I am prey to the jive hustler who does not hesitate to exploit my childhood friendship . I am reminded , too , when I go back to the old neighborhood in fear ? and have my purse snatched ? and when I sit down to a business lunch and have an old classmate wait on my table . I recall the girl I played dolls with who now rears five children on welfare , the boy from church who is in prison for murder , the pal found dead of a drug overdose in the alley where we once played tag . Attache Case : My life abounds in incongruities . Fresh from a vacation in Paris , I may , a week later , be on the milk-run Trailways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient uncle whose world stretched only 50 miles and who never learned to read . Sometimes when I wait at the bus stop with my attache case , I meet my aunt getting off the bus with other cleaning ladies on their way to do my neighbors ' floors . But I am not ashamed . Black progress has surpassed our greatest expectations ; we @# never even saw much hope for it , and the achievement has taken us by surprise . In my heart , however , there is no safe distance from the wretched past of my ancestors or the purposeless present of some of my contemporaries ; I fear such a fate can reclaim me . I am not comfortably middle class ; I am uncomfortably middle class . I have made it , but where ? Racism still dogs my people . There are still communities in which crosses are burned on the lawns of black families who have the money and grit to move in . What a hollow victory we have won when my sister , dressed in her designer everything , is driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she lives because the cab driver , noting only her skin color , assumes she is the maid , or the nanny , or the cook , but certainly not the lady of any house at this address . I have heard the immigrants ' bootstrap tales , the simplistic reproach of " why ca n't you people be like us . " I have fulfilled the entry requirements of the American middle class , yet I am left , at times , feeling unwelcome and stereotyped . I have overcome the problems of food , clothing and shelter , but I have not overcome my old nemesis , prejudice . Life is easier , being black is not . I am burdened daily with showing whites that blacks are people . I am , in the old vernacular , a credit to my race . I am my brothers ' keeper , and my sisters ' , though many of them have abandoned me because they think that I have abandoned them . I run a gauntlet between two worlds , and I am cursed and blessed by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I can also be used by both . I am a rope in a tug of war . If I am a token in my downtown office , so am I at my cousin 's church tea . I assuage white guilt . I disprove black inadequacy and prove to my parents ' generation that their patience was indeed a virtue . I have a foot in each world , but I can not fool myself about either . I can see the transparent deceptions of some whites and the bitter hopelessness of some blacks . I know how tenuous my grip on one way of life is , and how strangling the grip of the other way of life can be . Novelty : Many whites have lulled themselves into thinking that race relations are just grand because they were the first on their block to discuss crab grass with the new black family . Yet too few blacks and whites in this country send their children to school together , entertain each other or call each other friend . Blacks and whites dining out together draw stares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the train pulls out Friday evening until they meet me at the coffee machine Monday morning . I remain a novelty . Some of my " liberal " white acquaintances pat me on the head , hinting that I am a freak , that my success is less a matter of talent than of luck and affirmative action . I may live among them , but it is difficult to live with them . How can they be sincere about respecting me , yet hold my fellows in contempt ? And if I am silent when they attempt to sever me from my own , how can I live with myself ? Whites wo n't believe I remain culturally different ; blacks wo n't believe I remain culturally the same . I need only look in a mirror to know my true allegiance , and I am painfully aware that , even with my off-white trappings , I am prejudged by my color . As for the envy of my own people , am I to give up my career , my standard of living , to pacify them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for these amenities and deserve them , though I can never enjoy them without feeling guilty . These comforts do not make me less black , nor oblivious to the woe in which many of my people are drowning . As long as we are denigrated as a group , no one of us has made it . Inasmuch as we all suffer for every one left behind , we all gain for every one who conquers the hurdle .
