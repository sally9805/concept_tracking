Schmidt faces his foes <P> Most political leaders look forward to party conventions as festive tributes to their achievements , real or imagined . Not Helmut Schmidt . This week , as 400 delegates from West Germany 's ruling Social Democratic Party ( S.P.D. ) meet in a concrete , saucer-shaped hall built for the 1972 Munich Olympics , the West German Chancellor faces the sharpest criticism and the most divisive party battle of his eight-year tenure . So important is the confrontation that Schmidt has threatened to resign if the S.P.D. does not support his policy on nuclear defense . Though it appears unlikely that he will have to do so , the five-day debate may further undermine Schmidt 's authority at home and abroad . <P> The key issue at stake is Bonn 's support for a 1979 NATO decision to deploy 572 new U.S.-built intermediate-range nuclear missiles in five Western European countries , including West Germany , starting in late 1983 . At the insistence of Schmidt and other Western European leaders , the alliance simultaneously called for negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal of reducing the number of atomic weapons in Europe . The Europeans hoped that , if the U.S. could persuade Moscow to eliminate the 300 SS-20 missile launchers that could be aimed at Western Europe , NATO would not need to respond by deploying its own new missiles . But the powerful left wing of the S.P.D. opposes the Doppelbeschluss , or two-track decision , as risking an unnecessary escalation of the arms race . Bolstered by the strength of the West German peace movement , Schmidt 's critics in the party have set out to defeat his defense policies at the Munich congress , even if it means toppling him in the process . <P> The party hierarchy tried to head off an open fight by proposing to postpone the whole issue until a special convention in the fall of 1983 . The party hoped to give the U.S.-Soviet talks enough time to make progress . The left-wingers , however , would not go along with this maneuver . At local party meetings , they presented a battery of motions opposing the Doppelbeschluss . The left 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all new NATO and Warsaw Pact intermediate-range missiles until the Geneva negotiations end . Says Erhard Eppler , a leader of the peace movement and one of Schmidt 's main critics within the S.P.D. : " The two-track decision has one major fault . It is meant to pressure the Soviets , but not the Americans . " <P> Moscow has been quick to take advantage of Schmidt 's problems . Last month President Leonid Brezhnev announced that the Soviet Union had frozen its deployment of SS-20s , urging NATO to reverse its 1979 decision . President Reagan refused , arguing that a freeze would preserve the Soviet advantage . <P> Nearly half of the 22 regional party organizations have passed resolutions favoring the moratorium . Still , Schmidt 's political advisers are confident that at least 60% , and possibly as many as 80% , of the delegates wih1 reject the idea . Their reasoning is that voting on the local motions usually took place late in the evening , when most rank-and-file party members had gone home to bed and only the left-wing intellectual activists remained behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative workers who form the party 's backbone .
