A wet spring breeds disease <P> It was as if a killer from the Middle Ages had returned to strike anew . This summer the once dreaded scourge of bubonic plague is on the loose in the Southwest U.S. Since April , hospitals in five states have admitted 35 patients complaining of fever , chills , headache and swellings in the armpits , groin or neck . Six deaths have been reported so far ; the most recent was a 13-year-old New Mexico boy who died last week less than twelve hours after the disease was diagnosed . <P> This year 's outbreak is the most severe in the U.S. since 1925 , when 34 of 38 victims died . But it is comparable in name only to the Black Death that ravaged Europe in the 1300s . Spread by ship-borne rats and nurtured in urban filth and squalor , the plague killed an estimated 20 million people , roughly one-third of the Continent 's population , in a terrifying 2-year rampage . The disease has largely disappeared today because of improved sanitation , measures to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat the plague bacillus .

Left untreated , however , the illness is fatal in more than half the cases , developing into either the highly contagious pneumonic plague or septicemia ( blood poisoning ) , which caused all six of this year 's plague deaths . <P> In the U.S. , plague makes its infrequent appearances in the far West and Southwest because it flourishes among rodents of the high desert plains . The human risk is limited primarily to people trekking into the wilds who are bitten by fleas that have been infected by the rodents . The Navajo Indians of the region seem particularly susceptible , owing to their outdoor lifestyle , their sheepherding and their free-running dogs , all of which increase the risk of infection . They account for half of the cases in Arizona and New Mexico , where the disease has been concentrated this year . Nonetheless , the incidence is comparatively low even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases ? One likely culprit is the weather , says Dr. Jack Poland of the Centers for Disease Control 's regional office in Fort Collins , Colo .
