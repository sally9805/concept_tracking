When the three-hour session was over and the Poles and Pakistanis and the rest had gone their separate ways , Mr. Khonpoum made the 90-minute journey back to his apartment in the central Bronx . In the moments before his children began drifting home from their schools , he briefly reopened his notebook. // He had written the day ' s sentences carefully in blue pen - " I love that shirt , " and " I broke your ashtray , " and " Yes , it fits perfectly . " And here and there on the page , where Mr. Khonpoum wanted to remind himself of some fine point , he had added a note beside the English word in tiny , almost ornate Laotian script. // Mr. Khonpoum and his family reached the United States on June 24 , days before a Fourth of July holiday they spent watching a kung-fu movie , because there was no money for anything more elaborate . But nothing could more define the cause for celebration , on Liberty Weekend last July and on today ' s centennial day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment 15 at 2321 Hughes Avenue . <> <> The Next Chapter // The story of the Khonpoum family first emerged in a Bangkok dispatch in The New York Times on June 28 . It told how Mr. Khonpoum escaped from political detention in 1983 , how he had fled 375 miles to rejoin his wife and family in the Laotian capital of Vientiane and how they had escaped by raft across the Mekong River to Thailand and a refugee camp . But the article , written just before the family left for New York City , necessarily left open the next , American chapter. // Mr. Khonpoum delivered this part of the family saga yesterday afternoon . He sat on a folding chair in his living room , his infant daughter Thaithouna on his lap , and spoke in Laotian to his younger brother , Souvanh Vilayvanh. // Mr. Souvanh fled Laos in 1978 and has been here since 1981 . And much as immigrant children often translate for their parents , assuming a responsibility beyond their years , Mr. Souvanh was the intermediary for the brother 12 years his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , paraphased rather than translated , for Mr. Souvanh had never enjoyed the relative luxury of taking an English class . He learned the language when he lived on the streets of Honolulu and San Francisco and New York , a sinewy and slight young man , utterly alone . His mission now , he said , is to make his brother ' s transition somehow less painful . <> <> Dazzled and Baffled // " Before , I was too young , just a boy , " Mr. Souvanh said . " He take good care of me . I respect him like my father or mother . When I come to America , he worry about me . No job , no place to stay , drinking on the street - he was afraid I like that . But they come here after me , and they have nothing and they have problems . And I help them . I help them back. " // From the moment the Khonpoums arrived , they found themselves alternately dazzled and baffled by New York . They had lived in Paksay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughtering their food and walking four or five miles just to catch a bus . Then , suddenly , they were walking out of Kennedy International Airport and into new lives. // " When he first got here , the first beginning , he sees how all the people are dressed different , " Mr. Souvanh said as helped his brother through an interview . " So many walk around . He could not think anything . Just , ' Oh my God . ' But he wasn ' t scared . He was excited. " // The Khompoun family - Sone ' s wife Pratsany ; their son Soutchay , 14 , and their daughters Khanthadokmay , 10 ; Kasapa , 8 ; Chanthida , 5 , and Thaithouna , 1 - moved into an apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx with Mr. Souvanh and his American-born wife , Theresa . <> <> First Time in Supermarket // Mr. Souvanh helped his brother apply for the welfare and food-stamp benefits to which refugees are entitled . He taught him how to take the subway to the Chinatown section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his English class at the McBurney Y. But he could not soften every culture shock - such a the first time Mr. Khonpoum went into a supermarket. // " When he walk around and he see food , he see everything is killed and cleaned , everything is in a box , " Mr. Souvanh related . " He never see that before . He think he never see it again. " // After about a month in Soundview , the two families decided they could afford separate apartments . Their landlord gave them adjacent units in a building he owned in Belmont , the largely Italian enclave just south of Fordham University. // The two apartments suggest how much difference a few years of living in America can make . In Mr. Souvanh ' s living room , posters of the bands Motley Crue and Metallica hang on the walls , and Survivor ' s " Eye of the Tiger , " the theme song from " Rocky III , " booms from the stereo . <> <> Hot Dogs and Cowboys // Just a few doors away , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating a lunch of rice and a spicy fish stew . A bucket of uncooked rice , as if transported intact from a refugee camp , sits beside the refigerator . The lilting sound of Laotian music wafts in from a tape player in the bedroom. // But things are beginning to change . Mrs. Khonpoum is feeding the baby Thaithouna bits of hot dog along with the Laotian dishes . Khanthadokmay has covered the kitchen walls with photographs from American magazines - a cowboy astride his stallion , a living room decorated in pink and rose hues , and a model in an ebony evening gown. // Mr. Khonpoum , too , has his American dreams . He said he wanted to learn English well enough to find work as a mechanic , his job in Laos . Then , he said , he can buy a home or a car and send his children to college . But when learning a single sentence goes so slowly , Mr. Khonpoum said , it is hard to stay patient , hard to keep faith. // That is when Mr. Souvanh wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world by will alone . " Life is so hard to live , " Mr. Souvanh said . " And I want them to get everything easier than I got it . To have everything better than I have . A house . A car . Everything they want.
