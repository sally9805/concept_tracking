MENGELE IN JERUSALEM By Tova Reich hen I told Krystina that I had definitely seen him in Jerusalem , she was not impressed . Of course ; where else would he be ? But for a sour old Jew like you to finally break down and go there , she said  --  that was really something ! She said this even after he had officially been declared dead , after the comic relief of that clown squatting in the Brazilian grave , tossing out a skull and some ordinary hones , and the hunt for the peculiar doctor was called off . 1 always give serious consideration to Krystina 's words , especially when they apply to me , a subject in which I 've sustained a certain indifferent interest but for which I 've lost all passion whatsoever . Forty years ago Krystina sold herself to me with her placid solidity , but  --  an unanticipated bonus  --  there 's a bud's-eye intuition she possesses as well that I 've come to appreciate . So my Krystina is a clich ? ; clich  --  s , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate her . She does n't complain , nor has she the right to . I 've prospered so brilliantly in America they could put my picture in a brochure to promote this golden land , with Krystina , smug and well stuffed , alongside me . Only three things I 've denied her . I would not marry her and I would not give her a child . A wife and children I 've already had , in another life ; that trip I 've already taken , as they say in this deceptively - casual land . Last I saw of this wife and children , the building in whose cellar they were hiding was being sealed off by a gang of industrious Huns . Every crevice and air hole , the thoroughness was something to admire . Maybe it was a mistake of biblical proportions to turn my head for that final glimpse . Maybe I should have kept my eyes directly in front of me , on those train wagons meant for creatures who chew their cud , for us Jews , in other words , who keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed , never forgetting for an instant , never giving anyone a moment 's peace with our obsessive litany of sufferings , grievances , and complaints . As for me , I 've had it with Jews ; I 'm sick of us . Tova Reich is the author of Mara , a novel . That 's th8. third thing I 've refused Krystina : permission til convert . Speaking as an insider , for anyone iri.his right mind to desire to mutate into a Jew seems to me to be nothing less than a perversion , Ohealthy in the extreme . In Krystina 's case , it is perhaps a consequence of the masochism inherent in the female character . She cajoled and she pleaded . but I never yielded , nor will I ever . T'Aere was even a time that I found buried under - ter private effects pamphlets from a company that specializes in transacting conversions throtigh the mails  --  Plotzker 's Postal : Personalized onversions to Suit Every Taste , All Styles an Varieties , Ultra-Ultra Orthodox to Ethical- . **27;2811;TOOLONG Conscious , No Riid Tape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson , right in front of her eyes I shoved them into the oven and broiled them like a 4eak . Had I wanted a Jewess , I would have otten one . But whereas those bracketed yeas rendered many who had been squeezed into Them even more obnoxiously Jewish , branded them , committed them even against their will to that destiny alone , me they filled with a final determination to cut off every connection . If I recall correctly , in the early pages of his memoirs , the Man who ended my life records how the sight on his streets of a stooped , sickle-lack gabardine and black hat-ator  --  overwhelmed him with st that it was , in a sense , the im-petus for his bidliant career . I understand his at-titude perfectlf I , too , am often repelled by this anachronism , this deliberately provocative spectacle , the incendiary air of superiority and exclusivity that is exuded ; and it requires a strenuous effort of the will on my part to keep myself from 4ting my own grandfathers . But he , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hook steps , he translated his in-stincts into dads , in the process doing a favor for those who managed to survive his tantrums of endowing diem with an interesting past , giv-ing them a stoy , and creating , as a byproduct , a flourishing bl4-chip industry , Holocaust Inc . W- hat , then , forty years after , in the summer of 1985 , was I doing in Jerusalem ? Krystina was right to marvel . The answer has to do with the third right I 've acquired as an American  --  the right to pursue happiness . I take my citizen 's duties very seriously , so 1 pursue and pursue . Nevertheless , she has eluded me . Jews are justly despised for their litigious nature , but this Jew is not about to drag anyone to court ; we have been guaranteed only the pursuit . Yet it seems to me to have been a little cynical  --  dare I even say sadistic ? ? on the part of the Founding Fathers to append that pursuit-of-happiness clause . It is , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into those circles of hell reserved for such unfortunate sinners as Tantalus and Sisyphus , who are condemned for an eternity to struggle in vain . I am a man of action who likes to see results . When I set out in the pursuit of happiness , 1 expect to get her . But for many years now , nothing has given me pleasure . No success , no triumph , no springtime , no pastry , no touch  --  nothing . There is no happiness for me . No sorrow either . All feeling is lost . Tell me about the brutal death of a child : I am cold . Insult me , humiliate me , publicly expose my pettiest weaknesses , my smallest vanities , strip me naked : I feel nothing . Even the fact that I 've lost all feeling  --  from utter sadness to utter joy and whatever lies in between  --  even that leaves me unmoved . Yet feeling is necessary for happiness . As a hyphenated American who has good reason to appreciate the bounty of this land , pursuing her is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wealthy man can pamper himself , so whereas my father or my grandfather would have run to the rabbi crying , " Holy Rabbi , 1 have lost my delight . " I sought out a psychoanalyst . That was an indulgence , let me tell you , like visiting an expensive prostitute on a regular basis , into whom you can unload , dump , what no one else is inclined to receive ; and because you shell out such fat , crisp bills , you do n't even need to hypocritically inquire , How are you ? and then be sentenced to sit there politely enduring the tedious answer . A person gets a uniquely false sense of importance being encouraged to talk only about himself , to lay out for solemn scrutiny all his bits and pieces , all his marginalia , his insignificant clutter of biographical knickknacks . I do n't really understand why i even went ; it was a way to pass the rime , I suppose . My business was thriving on its own and no longer required my attention every moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to locate an analyst who was n't a Jew . A Jew would have been intolerable : he would have assumed too much , he would have taken conceptual liberties . With money , though , you can accomplish anything . His name was Jamie Hill . What was my problem ! Nothing makes me happy , Doctor . I feel nothing . Correction  --  not even nothing . Doctor , I said , I am dead . That is a synopsis of the first session . 1 told him this only so he would consider me a worthy and interesting enough case to take on . To even speak such words  --  although they are the banal truth  --  goes against my nature ; I 'm not a sensationalist . Let 's talk about it , said Jamie Hill , M.D. But over the next five years , the subject never came up again , and , personally , I never cared enough to raise it . What , then , did I discuss in that consulting room , opposite his still , warm body ? Business mostly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! Should I go into this deal with so-and-so  --  yes , no , maybe ? Should I buy Krystina the sable coat she wants ? Yes , but maybe a diamond bracelet would be a better investment because if ever we should part company and I would be obliged to take the bracelet back , diamonds never lose value , you know , they could be clasped around another lady 's wrist , whereas a coat , a coat , a coat , becomes worn and threadbare , for another woman it would require alterations and adjustments , and so on and so forth . Problems with employees , help , underlings , servants , though I never mentioned him  --  Dr. Hill , that is by name , out of deference to his self-esteem , although there 's no question that what he was doing was servicing me . Which car to buy ? What vacation to take ? Ruminations , the sort of empty scrawls that are daily processed and reprocessed across the mind 's slate , but it was a luxury , a luxury indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this fashion that I used Hill as my vessel for nearly five years exactly . It happened just around then ( after five years , that is , the period of time allotted to determine whether or not the cancer has been licked ) that Hill suggested that perhaps I ought to undergo some STORY 65 testing  --  a lie detector test I think it was that he mentioned in particular . Test batteries he wanted to insert into me ; then I would really shine , then I would be rendered transparent . In short , he planned to figure me out statistically , to reduce me to the lowest common denominator , to balance me . And then , entirely by accident , I discovered that his real name was n't Jamie Hill at all , but Hymie Goldberg , a South American , it turned out , and I quit without explanation , cutting off , by my calculations , approximately one sixth of his annual income . Who informed me about Goldberg-Hill , the fraud ? It happened to have been an acquaintance of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nevertheless I did n't hold it against him since he took precautions not to be a pain in the neck about it . After all , I 'm a Jew , too . I could have undergone an operation to change myself into a Unitarian , or something benign like that , but what would have been the point ? I 'm not against associating with my kind as long as they 're discreet , as long as they do n't make a federal case about it . Identity , identity  --  for heaven 's sake , stop hammering me over the head with your wretched identity . In a profession in which people have been known to change their name from Johnson to Cohen in order to get ahead , the stockbroker Fogel said to me , this dumb shrink switches from Goldberg to Hill . How do you figure it ? Which only goes to prove that he not only is a little weird , but also obviously stupid . And stupidity , by the way , is not such a rare commodity among Jews , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot public relations type who would spread the news to the Gentiles that we Jews have also been allotted our fair share of stupid sons , maybe then there 'd be a major cutback in anti-Semitism in this world . We were standing at the counter at Cartier when Fogel gave me the goods on Goldberg-Hill . I had in my hand a sapphire ring I was contemplating as a gift for Krystina , and , by the way , also as an intelligent investment , In the nimbus of the gem , tinged by a blue out of time , I watched the passage of a strikingly elegant woman . She was dressed in an old-fashioned tailored suit , and a wide-brimmed hat slouched over one eye . Half her face was dark , in deep shadow , yet not a single detail escaped me  --  the mole at the right-hand corner of her upper lip , the heartbreaking curve of her throat , the muscles of her calves tight . ening inside her silk stockings . This was my wife in her best hour . But , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had existed , that she had crawled out of the cellar , she would have been a much older woman by now . The solution was obvious : this woman  --  I longed to set the sapphire down in the soft part of the palm of her hand , fold her fingers over it one by one , like a baby 's fist  --  this woman could only be my daughter . Here she was , a stately vision , shopping in the afternoon at Cartier like any pampered lady . Nothing unimaginable had happened to her . Tell me , who could prove that anything had happened ? Where , except in the unreliable circuits of human memory , was there any evidence that something grotesque had taken place ? She was achingly attractive , this image of my daughter , but Fogel , for his part , was roo engrossed in unloading what he knew about the psychiatrist to take note or pay his respects . " Do n't tell me you were a client of his , " Fogel intruded rather presumptuously . Client is a falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter nor just then floated past in a pale dream , I would have quickly invented some kind of story to explain my connection to Goldberg-Hill . But seeing her again  --  it disoriented me . I admitted it , yes . For this apathy I suffer from , I said to Fogel . For this sense I have of not being alive . In my experience , it 's always a mistake to weaken and unburden yourself , to blurt out a confession , for that in turn softens up your listener and expels from him a confession that you never wanted to be inflicted with in the first place . Yes , Fogel said , he , too , used to be oppressed by this feeling that he was a machine of some sort , an automaton that had been programmed  --  a money-making machine , a family-man machine , a consumer machine , a tooth-brushing , shaving , showering , newspaper-processing , television-watching , desk-clearing , garbage-taking-out , and so on machine . That 's how it used to be with Fogel , until , according to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , at what he called his spiritual spa , and the effects lasted , they lasted right through one year until the next one , they carried him over until the time arrived for his next fix . Once a year , Fogel told me , he traveled to Jerusalem , to the black section of the city they called it Me'ah She'arim , One Hundred Gates where the most zealous Jews , the ones in the black coats , lived . There Fogel sat for a week at the table of the saintly Reb Mendele . " I do n't know what it is about Reb Mendele , " Fogel said to me , " but at his table 1 am fed happiness , and the leftovers I take home with me in little doggie bags . " So this was my sordid fate : Hill was really Goldberg , and Fogel was really a Hasid . No matter how hard I tried , I could n't get away from them . Some Jews are more prone to attract other Jews ; this is a clinical fact . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite invitation . And it 's not as if I ran from my meeting with Fogel directly to the travel agent to book the last ticket to Tel Aviv . That conversation at Cartier took place in 1980 . Five more years went by before I called Fogel again to get this Reb Mendele 's address . I do n't know what , in the end , brought me to Jerusalem . Krystina said I was desperate for a little " jewing . " As she pronounced it , it sounded like chewing : would I chew ( for we Jews are the perpetual chewers ) or would 1 be chewed ( chewed , also , we have been ) ? Desperate I was ; again Krystina was on the mark . Reb Mendele was a charlatan . That 's what I expected . I got what I expected . But nobody would say of me that I had lacked seriousness in the pursuit . he most exceptional thing about Reb Mendele was his physical stature : he was extremely short and slight . When he sat at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , and his feet underneath dangled , like a child 's , a few inches above the floor . Reb Mendele 's Hasidim claimed that he fed on the celestial fruits and nectars of the mysteries , and thus was he sustained . The one thing most religions have in common is this use of elevated language designed to obscure , mislead , and deceive . Celes tial fruits and nectars of the mysteries indeed ! Inside those inflated words , what was there ? Hot air . But it 's true that Reb Mendele appeared to be a happy man , always giggling and cracking jokes . Each morning his wife would march into the room where he sat enthroned at the head of the table with his court flanking him on both sides like two wings . Compared with Reb Mendele , his wife was three times as high and three times as wide . In her hands she would bear a tray on which she had arranged a giant glass of prune juice , a kettle of hot water , and a plate of sliced lemons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down every last drop if you know what 's good for you ! " Then she would set the tray down in front of her husband , turn with the haughty air of a person who was truly an insider , truly in the innermost inner circles , unlike the deluded flunkies around the table , and carry herself out with formidable dignity . As soon as she was gone , Reb ivlendele would point to the big glass of prune juice . " The Bomb ! " he would declare . " One hundred percent guaranteed ! " Then he would squeeze some lemon juice into it and pass it around the table for each of his Hasidim to take a sip , the potion growing more and more diluted as the hot water was added for the junior members of the court , with the more robust bowels , who sat at the foot of the table . When it made its way back to Reb Mendele , the glass was licked clean , and his wife looked properly satisfied as she entered to reclaim the tray . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinterpreted the practice of shirayim , wherein the disciples pounce on the rabbi 's leavings for a morsel of the food that has been blessed by the holy man , touched by his lips , his hand , meant for him . " There are three occasions when it is explicitly permitted to fool one 's wife , " Reb Mendele taught : " When it makes the wife happy , when it makes your fellow Jews happy , and when it makes the husband happy . The wife is happy because she believes with full faith that I have obeyed her and drunk my prune juice . My fellow Jews are happy because they have sampled a bit of the rebbe 's shirayim . And the rabbi , too , a mere trembling husband in this case , he is happy as well because , as you know , he hates prune juice . " " Ya ha ha , ya ha ba , ya ba bum , " sang the Hasidim , and they pounded the table ecstatically as they assimilated their rabbi 's wisdom . But what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I was not happy . " Never mind , " Reb Mendele said . " To you I will give a piece of your mother 's honey cake . " My mother 's honey cake ? What in the world could that possibly mean ? Had I truly had a mother once ? And if I had one , did Reb Mendele in his darkest dreams find out what had happened to her , much less to her honey cake ? Here was another example of the corruption of language in the service of religion , empty words diabolically twisted to resonate a profundity , a cosmic enigma , that simply was not there . However , at least l still possessed my sanity , and for the sake of its preservation it was necessary to get myself away from that hilarious table as often as possible . So I began to walk in and out of the narrow alleyways of Me'ah She'arim , elbowing my way through the swarm of black coats and black hats . At first they all looked alike to me , like insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And , again , that old sensation would well up in me of revulsion and disgust , the same sensation that the marionette with the little fake mustache who ended my life describes so richly in his inspirational memoirs . But then , as I waded deeper and deeper into that sea of black , distinct faces began to emerge , ordinary and extraordinary , as if my eyes had grown accustomed to the dark , or as if a shaft of light had suddenly been beamed to illuminate the anomalies . The converts , in particular , stood out for scrutiny . There was , for example , an American Negro basketball player  --  he could have been nothing else  --  wearing a specially ordered black caftan and black hat , advancing with great giraffe strides , his eyes cast down so as not to attract too much attention , his long sidelocks curled tight as springs . A apanese , sparsely bearded for reasons of genetic code , attired in the striped robe of a particular Hasidic sect , on his head a crocheted white yarmulke with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I saw him . I recognized him instantly  --  how could I not ? ? despite his black satin gabardine tied with a rope belt , despite his fringed garment , his long white stockings , his black felt hat brushed to a regimental shine , the purple velvet **29;2840;TOOLONG bag embroidered with a gold Star of David tucked under his arm . But the face was indelible : the heavy , feral eyebrows ; the gap between the teeth , Could I ever forget it ? And now , when 1 set out into the narrow lanes and courtyards of Me'ah She'arim , I set out for him alone . I saw him many times , coming and going from the synagogue to the study hall to the bank before I dared open my mouth and greet him . " Well , a good morning to you , Reb Men-gele . " " And a good morning to you as well , Reb Yid . " " So  --  I see you 've stopped practicing medicine . Everyone 's given up looking for you . They all think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baruch haShem , thank God . " sidelocks that now framed his face were the color of ash . Under his felt hat I could see the lower crescent of his full black velvet yarmulke . But his famous eyebrows were still dark . And the space in his mouth still delivered a licentious look . And he still emanated that air of medical authority that made you , against your will , want to please him , to win his approval , to have him pronounce you his favorite client . Naturally he had aged . From aging , at least , he was not immune . After all , the last time I had seen him was more than forty years ago , when I was a camper in the camp in which he was the camp doctor . We must have done something pretty awful that day , because he had us  --  about two hundred or so of us campers  --  gathered around a trench of some sort . From this group he counted out one hundred and fifty exactly , counted twice to make sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be numbered in this select group . So , as 1 said , he counted out one hundred and fifty , me among them , and shot us all . There was some mild protest , some polite confusion among the chosen one hundred and fifty , which gave me , or so I believe , the opportunity to crawl out of the hole into which we had fallen one on top of the other , like rows of theoretic dominoes , and to rejoin the group of campers still standing on the side being taught a lesson , the ones who had not been selected . Afterward , when the smoke cleared , as the cowboys say , the peculiar doctor ordered that the dead be dragged out of the pit and counted . One hundred and forty-nine . No question : a dead man was missing . Then he ordered that the bodies be laid out in rows of ten . So we arranged them in fifteen rows , and it was true , the last row contained nine corpses only . It would have been an easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who were still standing upright , put a bullet through his head , simply even things out , and call it a day . But the peculiar doctor believed in the natural , the divinely inspired , correctness of his original selections . He set us to work searching for the missing dead man . For five days I squatted in that grave , digging in the dirt for my corpse . The labor was heavy . Men toiling alongside me fell down dead during the hunt for my remains . The one hundred and fiftieth dead body was never found . ?
