Nobels for three Americans , a Japanese and a Swede <P> To the naked eye , inanimate objects like a block of stone or a piece of metal appear totally lifeless . But scientists see a veritable cauldron of activity in the most passive-looking object . Its atoms and molecules are in constant motion , vibrating furiously , bumping into neighbors , reeling in every direction . Though imperceptible to human senses , this chaotic ballet is critically important . Not only does it determine the very nature of observed matter ( what makes a stone a stone , for example ) , it controls what will happen when one substance is brought together with another . <P> Last week the 1981 Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry , worth about $182,000 each , went to five men , three Americans , a Swede and a Japanese , for helping open windows on that frenzied dance of the atoms . In their work , they used one of the more esoteric tools of 20th century science : quantum mechanics , a mathematical way of looking at the paradoxically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like waves , sometimes like particles . But their results have everyday importance , for example , in the development of techniques for measuring pollution and the creation of new drugs and chemicals . <P> Half of the physics prize will go to Kai Siegbahn , 63 , of Sweden 's Uppsala University , who follows in the footsteps of his late father Karl Siegbahn , the 1924 laureate in physics. * The other half of the award will be shared equally by two Americans , Nicolaas Bloembergen , 61 , a Dutch-born Harvard professor , and Arthur Schawlow , 60 , of Stanford . The prize in chemistry will go to Kenichi Fukui , 63 , of Japan 's Kyoto University , and Roald Hoffmann , 44 , of Cornell University . <P> Once again the U.S. did well in the Nobel rivalry . Including the previously announced prize in medicine , in which two of the three winners were American ( Caltech 's Roger Sperry and Harvard 's David Hubel ) , the U.S. this year can claim five of the eight science laureates , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited for contributions to spectroscopy , a basic tool for studying atoms and molecules that dates back to the moment when Sir Isaac Newton passed a beam of sunlight through a prism and found that it was split into a rainbow of colors , a spectrum . Newton 's successors discovered that any material heated to incandescence not only produces a spectrum but one so distinctive that it could be used like a fingerprint for identifying the substance . Astronomers soon found that the spectra of distant stars yielded all manner of information , including the star 's composition , age , temperature , motion , magnetic field , even whether it was a single or double star . <P> Yet spectra can also be created by directing a light beam or , say , X or gamma rays at an object . As the radiant energy strikes the atoms , their electrons hop from one orbit ( or , in the language of quantum mechanics , one energy level ) to another , absorbing or emitting light at specific frequencies . Such spectra yielded invaluable data about atomic and molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional spectroscopy had run into difficulties .
