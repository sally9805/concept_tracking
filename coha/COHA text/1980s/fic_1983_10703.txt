Anyway , Jeeter came over to your car and looked in at you ? " " Yes . He wanted me to get out , and I would n't . He said I should at least roll down the window , so we would n't have to shout to hear each other . I said I did n't mind shouting a little . He threatened to smash the window if I did n't roll it down . I knew if I did , he 'd reach right inside and unlock the door , so I figured it was better to get out of the car willingly .

I was n't even sure I could pull the trigger . But I knew I could n't let Jeeter see I had any doubts . " " If he 'd seen , he 'd have eaten you alive . " " That 's what I thought .

" The lieutenant shook his head . " You sure had him pegged right . " " I also reminded him that he might need a doctor some day . What if he took a spill off that bike of his and was lying on the road , critically injured , and I was the doctor who showed up  --  after he 'd hurt me and given me good reason to hurt him in return ? I told him there are things a doctor can do to complicate injuries , to make sure the patient has a long and painful recovery . I asked him to think about that . " Whitman gaped at her .

Then he climbed back on his Harley and rode away , and the other three followed him . " " And you just went on to Mount Larson ? " " What else ? I still had a patient to see . " " Incredible . " " I will admit , though , I had the sweats and the shakes all the way to Mount Larson . " " And no biker has ever bothered you since ? " " In fact , when they pass me on the roads around here , they all smile and wave . " Whitman laughed .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled , opened a box of ammunition , and began to load the revolver . The lieutenant took a couple of shells from another carton and loaded a shotgun . They were silent for a moment , and then he said , " Would you have done what you told Gene Terr ? " " What ? Shoot him ? " " No . I mean , if he 'd hurt you , maybe raped you , and then if you 'd later had a chance to treat him as a patient . . . would you have . . . ? " Jenny finished loading the Magnum , clicked the cylinder into place , and put the gun down . " Well , I 'd be tempted . But on the other hand , I have enormous respect for the Hippocratic Oath .

" " What 's that ? " " Just plain Doc . " " Doc ? " He thought about it , and a slow smile spread over his face . " Doc . It makes you think of one of those grizzled , cantankerous old coots that Barry Fitzgerald used to play in the movies , way back in the thirties and forties . " " Sorry I 'm not grizzled . " " That 's okay . You 're not an old coot , either . " She laughed softly . " I like the irony of it , " Whitman said . " Doc .

" Bryce , " Gary said , " Jack just ca n't come to the phone right now.  |p103There  's an important dinner underway here . The Japanese trade minister and the consul general from San Francisco .

I ca n't spend fifteen minutes laying this whole thing out for you and then another fifteen laying it out again for Jack . Listen , I 'm in Snowfield . It appears as if everyone who lived here is dead , Gary . " " What ? " " Five hundred people . " " Bryce , if this is some sort of joke or  --  " " Five hundred dead . And that 's the least of it .

When he joined the Los Angeles police , he had been assigned to Jack for his rookie year . At that time , Jack was a seven-year veteran of the force , a seasoned hand . Indeed , Jack had seemed so savvy and streetwise that Bryce had despaired of ever being even half as good at the job . In a year , however , he was better . They voted to stay together , partners . But eighteen months later , fed up with a legal system that regularly turned loose the punks he worked so hard to imprison , Jack quit police work and went into politics . As a cop , he 'd collected a fistful of citations for bravery . He parlayed his hero image into a seat on the L.A. city council , then ran for mayor , winning in a landslide . From there , he 'd jumped into the governor 's chair . It was a far more impressive career than Bryce 's own halting progress to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the more aggressive of the two . " Doody ? Is that you ? " Jack asked , picking up the phone in Sacramento.  |p104Doody  was his nickname for Bryce . He 'd always said that Bryce 's sandy hair , freckles , wholesome face , and marionette eyes made him look like Howdy Doody . " It 's me , Jack . " " Gary 's raving some lunatic nonsense  --  " " It 's true , " Bryce said . He told Jack all about Snowfield . After listening to the entire story , Jack took a deep breath and said , " I wish you were a drinking man , Doody . " " This is n't booze talking , Jack . Listen , the first thing I want is  --  " " National Guard ? " " No ! " Bryce said . " That 's exactly what I want to avoid as long as we have any choice . " " If I do n't use the Guard and every agency at my disposal , and then if it later turns out I should 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , and there 'll be a herd of hungry cows all around me . " " Jack , I 'm counting on you to make the right decisions , not just the right political decisions . Until we know more about the situation , we do n't want hordes of Guardsmen tramping around up here . They 're great for helping out in a flood , a postal strike , that sort of thing . But they 're not full-time military men . They 're shoe salesmen and attorneys and carpenters and schoolteachers . This calls for a tightly controlled , efficient little police action , and that sort of thing can be conducted only by real cops , full-time cops . " " And if your men ca n't handle it ? " " Then I 'll be the first to yell for the Guard . " Finally Retlock said , " Okay . No Guardsmen . For now . " Bryce sighed . " And I want to keep the State Health Department out of here , too . " " Doody , be reasonable . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contagious disease has wiped out Snowfield  --  or some kind of environmentalpoisoning  --  " " Listen , Jack , Health does a fine job when it comes to tracking down and controlling vectors for outbreaks of plague or mass food poisoning or water contamination . But essentially , they 're bureaucrats ; they move slowly . We ca n't afford to move slowly on this . I have the gut feeling that we 're living strictly on borrowed time . All hell could break loose at any time ; in fact , I 'll be surprised if it does n't . Besides , the Health Department does n't have the equipment to handle it , and they do n't have a contingency plan to cover the death of an entire town . But there 's someone who does , Jack . The Army Medical Corps ' CBW Division has a relatively new programthey call the Civilian Defense Unit . "  | " CBW Division ? " Retlock asked . There was a new tension in his voice . " You do n't mean the chemical and biological warfare boys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it has anything to do with nerve gas or germ war  --  " " Probably not , " Bryce said , thinking of the Liebermanns ' severed heads , of the creepy feeling that had overcome him inside the covered passageway , of the incredible suddenness with which Jake Johnson had vanished . " But I do n't know enough about it to rule out CBW or anything else . " A hard edge of anger had crystallized in the governor 's voice . " If the damned army has been careless with one of its fucking doomsday viruses , I 'm going to have their heads ! " " Easy , Jack . Maybe it 's not an accident . Maybe it 's the work of terrorists who got their hands on a sample of some CBW agent . Or maybe it 's the Russians running a little test of our CBW analysis and defense system . It was to handle those kinds of situations that the Army Medical Corps instructed its CBW Division to create General Copperfield 's office . " " Who 's Copperfield ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CivilianDefense Unit of the CBW Division . This is precisely the kind of situationthey want to be notified about . Within hours , Copperfield can put a team of well-trained scientists into Snowfield . First-rate biologists , virologists , bacteriologists , pathologists with training in the very latest forensic medicine , at least one immunologist and biochemist , a neurologist  --  and even a neuropsychologist . Copperfield 's department has designed elaboratemobile field laboratories . They 've got them garaged at depots all over the country , so there must be one relatively close to us . Hold off the State Health gang , Jack . They do n't have people of the caliber that Copperfield can provide , and they do n't have state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment as mobile as Copperfield 's . I want to call the general ; I am going to call him , Iin fact , but I 'd prefer to have your agreement and your guarantee that state bureaucrats wo n't be tramping around here , interfering . " After a brief hesitation , Jack Retlock said , " Doody , what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's department are even necessary ? " " You 'll hold off Health ? " " Yes . What else do you need ? " Bryce glanced down at the list in front of him . " You could approach the telephone company about puffing the Snowfield circuits off automatic twitching . When the world finds out what 's happened up here , every phone in town will be ringing off the hook , and we wo n't be able to maintainp106essential communications . If they could route all calls to and from Snow field through a few special operators and weed out the crank stuff and  --  " " I 'll handle it , " Jack said . " Of course , we could lose the phones at any time . Dr. Paige had trouble getting a call out when she first tried , so I 'll need a shortwave set . The one here at the substation seems to 've been sabotaged . " " I can get you a mobile shortwave unit , a van that has its own gasoline generator . The Office of Earthquake Preparedness has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators , it 'd be nice if we did n't have to depend on the public power supply . Evidently , our enemy here can tamper with it at will . Could you get two big generators for us ? " " Can do . Anything else ? " " If I think of anything , I wo n't hesitate to ask . " " Let me tell you , Bryce , as a friend , I hate like hell to see you in the middle of this one . But as the governor , I 'm damned glad it fell in your jurisdiction , whatever the hell it is . There are some prize assholes out there who 'd already have screwed it up if it 'd fallen in their laps . By now , if it was a disease , they 'd have spread it to half the state . We sure can use you up there . " " Thanks , Jack . " They were both silent for a moment . Then Retlock said , " Doody ? " " Yeah , Jack . " " Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bryce said . " Well , I 've got to get on to Copperfield . I 'll call you later . " The governor said , " Please do that , Bryce . Call me later . Do n't you vanish , old buddy . " Bryce put down the phone and looked around the substation . Stu Wargleand Frank were removing the front access plate from the radio . Tal and Dr. Paige were loading guns . Gordy Brogan and young Lisa Paige , the biggest and the smallest of the group , were making coffee and putting food on one of the worktables . Even in the midst of disaster , Bryce thought , even here in the Twilight Zone , we have to have our coffee and supper . Life goes on . He picked up the receiver to call Copperfield 's number out at Dugway , Utah . There was no dial tone . He jiggled the disconnect button . " Hello , " he said . Nothing.  |p107Bryce  sensed someone or something listening . He could feel the presence , just as Dr. Paige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked lie did n't really expect an answer , but he got one . It was n't a voice . It was a peculiar yet familiar sound : the cry of birds , perhaps gulls ; yes , sea gulls shrieking high above a windswept shoreline . It changed . It became a clattering sound . A rattle . Like beans in a hollow gourd . The warning sound of a rattlesnake . Yes , no doubt about it . The very distinct sound of a rattlesnake . And then it changed again . Electronic buzzing . No , not electronic . Bees . Bees buzzing , swarming . And now the cry of gulls once more . And the call of another bird , a trilling musical voice . And panting . Like a tired dog . And snarling . Not a dog . Something larger . And the hissing and spitting of fighting cats . Although there was nothing especially menacing about the sounds themselves  --  except , perhaps , for the rattlesnake and the snarling  --  Bryce was chilled by them . The animal noises ceased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " No answer . " What do you want ? " Another sound came over the wire , and it pierced Bryce as if it were a dagger of ice . Screams . Men and women and children . More than a few of them . Dozens , scores . Not stage screams ; not make-believe terror . They were the stark , shocking cries of the damned : screams of agony , fear , and soul-searing despair . Bryce felt sick . His heart raced . It seemed to him that he had an open line to the bowels of Hell . Were these the cries of Snowfield 's dead , captured on a recording tape ? By whom ? Why ? Is it live or is it Memorex ? One final scream . A child . A little girl . She cried out in terror , then in pain , then in unimaginable suffering , as if she were being torn apart . Her voice rose , spiraled up and upSilence : The silence was even worse than the screaming because the unnameable presence was still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He was stricken by an awareness of pure , unrelenting evil . It was there . He quickly put down the phone.  |p108He  was shaking . He had not been in any danger  --  yet he was shaking . He looked around the bull pen . The others were still busy with the tasks he had assigned to them . Apparently , no one had noticed that his most recent session on the phone had been far different from those that had gone before it . Sweat trickled down the back of his neck . Eventually , he would have to tell the others what had happened . But not right now . Because right now he could n't trust his voice . They would surely hear the nervous flutter , and they would know that this strange experience had badly shaken him . Until reinforcements arrived , until their foothold in Snowfield was more firmly established , until they all felt less afraid , it was n't wise to let the others see him shaking with dread . They looked to him for leadership , after all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep , cleansing breath . He picked up the receiver and immediately got a dial tone . Immensely relieved , he called the CBW Civilian Defense Unit in Dugway , Utah . Lisa liked Gordy Brogan . At first he had seemed menacing and sullen . He was such a big man , and his hands were so enormous they made you think of the Frankenstein monster . His face was rather handsome , actually , but when he frowned , even if he was n't angry , even if he was just worrying about something or thinking especially hard , his brows knitted together in a fierce way , and his black-black eyes grew even blacker than usual , and he looked like doom itself . A smile transformed him . It was the most astonishing thing . When Gordy smiled , you knew right away that you were seeing the real Gordy Brogan . You knew that the other Gordy  --  the one you thought you saw when he frowned or when his face was in repose  --  was purely a figment of your imagination . His warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , the gentleness in his broad brow . When you got to know him , he was like a big puppy , eager to be liked . He was one of those rare adults who could talk to a kid without being selfconsciousor condescending or patronizing . He was even better in that regard than Jenny . And even under the current circumstances , he could laugh . As they put the food on the table  --  lunch meat , bread , cheese , fresh fruit , doughnuts  --  and brewed the coffee , Lisa said , " You just do n't seem like a cop to me. "  | " Oh ? " Gordy said . " What 's a cop supposed to seem like ? " " Whoops . Did I say the wrong thing ? Is cop ' an offensive word ? " " In some quarters , it is . Like in prisons , for instance . " She was amazed that she still could laugh after everything that had happened this evening . She said , " Seriously . What do officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't matter . I 'm a deputy , policeman , cop  --  whatever you like . Except you think I do n't really look the part . " " Oh , you look the part all right , " Lisa said . " Especially when you scowl . But you do n't seem like a cop . " " What do I seem like to you ? " " Let me think . " She took an immediate interest in this game , for it diverted her mind from the nightmare around her the pulpit , you 'd be just fantastic delivering a fire-andbrimstonesermon . And I can see you sitting in a parsonage , an encouragingsmile on your face , listening to people 's problems . " " Me , a minister , " he said , clearly astonished . " With that imagination of yours , you should be a writer when you grow up . " " I think I should be a doctor like Jenny . A doctor can do so much good . " She paused . " You know why you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't picture you using that . " She pointed at his revolver . " I ca n't picture you shooting someone . Not even if he deserved it . " She was startled by the expression that came over Gordy Brogan 's face . He was visibly shocked . Before she could ask what was wrong , the lights flickered . She looked up . The lights flickered again . And again . She glanced at the front windows . Outside , the streetlights were blinking , too . No , she thought . No , please , God , not again . Do n't throw us into darknessagain ; please , please ! The lights went out.  |p110Bryce  Hammond had spoken to the night-duty officer manning the emergencyline at the CBW Civilian Defense Unit at Dugway , Utah . He had n't needed to say much before he 'd been patched through to General Galen Copperfield 's home number . Copperfield had listened , but he had n't said much . Bryce wanted to know whether it seemed at all likely that a chemical or biological agent had caused Snowfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that was all he would say . He warned Bryce that they were speaking on an unsecured telephone line , and he made vague but stern references to classified information and security clearances . When he 'd heard all of the essentials but only a few details , he cut Bryce off rather curtly and suggested they discuss the rest of it when they met face to face . " I 've heard enough to be convinced that my organization should be involved . " He promised to send a field lab and a team of investigators into Snowfield by dawn or shortly thereafter . Bryce was putting down the receiver when the lights flickered , dimmed , flickered , wavered  --  and went out . He fumbled for the flashlight on the desk in front of him , found it , and switched it on , Upon returning to the substation a while ago , they had located two additional , long-handled police flashlights . Gordy had taken one ; Dr. Paige had taken the other . Now , both of those lights flicked on simultaneously , carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan of action , a routine to follow if the lights went off again . Now , as planned , everyone moved to the center of the room , away from the doors and windows , and clustered together in a circle , facing outward , their backs turned to one another , reducing their vulnerability . No one said much of anything . They were all listening intently . Lisa Paige stood to the left of Bryce , her slender shoulders hunched , her head tucked down . Tal Whitman stood at Bryce 's right . His teeth were bared in a silent snarl as he studied the darkness beyond the sweeping scythe of the flashlight beam . Tal and Bryce were holding revolvers . The three of them faced the rear half of the room , while the other fourp111Dr . Paige , Gordy , Frank , and Stu  --  faced the front . Bryce played the beam of his flashlight over everything , for even the shadowy outlines of the most mundane objects suddenly seemed threatening . But nothing hid or moved among the familiar pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , toward the right-hand corner of the room , were two doors . One led to the corridor that served the three holding cells . They had searched that part of the building earlier ; the cells , the interrogation room , and the two bathrooms that occupied that half of the ground floor were all deserted . The other door led to stairs that went up to the deputy 's apartment ; those rooms , too , were unoccupied . Nevertheless , Bryce repeatedly brought the beam of light back to the half-open doors ; he was uneasy about them . In the darkness , something thumped softly . " What was that ? " Wargle asked . " It came from over this way , " Gordy said . " No , from over this way , " Lisa Paige said . " Quiet ! " Bryce said sharply . Thump ... thump-thump . It was the sound of a padded blow . Like a dropped pillow striking the floor . Bryce swept his light rapidly back and forth . Tal tracked the beam with his revolver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out for the rest of the night ? What do we do when the flashlight batteries finally go dead ? What happens then ? He had not been afraid of darkness since he 'd been a small child . Now he remembered what it was like . Thump-thump . . . thump . . . thump-thump . Louder . But not closer . Thump ! " The windows ! " Frank said . Bryce swung around , probing with his flashlight . Three bright beams found the front windows at the same time , transformingthe mullioned squares of glass into mirrors that hid whatever lay beyond them . " Turn your lights toward the floor or ceiling , " Bryce said . One beam swung up , two down . The backsplash of light revealed the windows , but it did n't turn them into reflective silver surfaces.  |p112Thum|p  ! Something struck a window , rattled a loose pane , and rebounded into the night . Bryce had an impression of wings . " What was it ? " "  --  bird  --  " "  --  not a bird of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " "  --  awful  --  " It returned , battering itself against the glass with greater determination than before : **29;10548;TOOLONG ! Lisa screamed . Frank Autry gasped , and Stu Wargle said , " Holy shit ! " Gordy made a strangled , wordless sound . Staring at the window , Bryce felt as if he had lurched through the curtain of reality , into a place of nightmare and illusion . With the streetlamps extinguished , Skyline Road was dark except for the luminous moonfall ; however , the thing at the window was vaguely illuminated . Even vague illumination of that fluttering monstrosity was too much . What Bryce saw on the other side of the glass  --  what he thought he saw in the kaleidoscopic multiplicity of light , shadow , and shimmering moonlight  --  wassomething out of a fever dream . It had a three- or four-foot wingspan . An insectoid head . Short , quivering antennae . Small , pointed , and ceaselessly working mandibles . A segmented body . The body was suspended between the pale gray wings and was approximately the size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was gray , the same shade as the wings  --  a moldy , sickly gray  --  and fuzzy and moist-looking . Bryce glimpsed eyes , as well : huge , ink-black , multifaceted , protuberant lenses that caught the light , refracting and reflecting it , gleaming darkly and hungrily . If he was seeing what he thought he was seeing , the thing at the window was a moth as large as an eagle . Which was madness . It bashed itself against the windows with new fury , in a frenzy now , its pale wings beating so fast that it became a blur . It moved along the dark panes , repeatedly rebounding into the night , then returning , trying feverishlyto crash through the window . Thumpthumpthumpthump . But it did n't have the strength to smash its way inside . Furthermore , it did n't have a carapace ; its body was entirely soft , and in spite of its incredible size and formidable appearance , it was incapable of cracking the glass . Thumpthumpthump . Then it was gone . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryce thought . When they realized that the thing at the window was n't going to return , they all moved , by unspoken consent , to the front of the room . They went through the gate in the railing , into the public area , to the windows , gazing out in stunned silence . Skyline Road was unchanged . The night was empty . Nothing moved . Bryce sat down in the creaking chair at Paul Henderson 's desk . The others gathered around . " So , " Bryce said . " So , " Tal said . They looked at one another . They fidgeted . " Any ideas ? " Bryce asked . No one said anything . " Any theories about what it might have been ? " " Gross , " Lisa said , and shuddered . " It was that , all right , " Dr. Paige said , putting a comforting hand on her younger sister 's shoulder . Bryce was impressed with the doctor 's emotional strength and resiliency . She seemed to be taking every shock that Snowfield threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up better than his own men . Hers were the only eyes that did n't slide away when he met them ; she returned his stare forthrightly . This , he thought , is a special woman . " Impossible , " Frank Autry said . " That 's what it was . Just plain impos-sible . " " Hell , what 's the matter with you people ? " Wargle asked . He screwed up his meaty face . " It was only a bird . That 's all it was out there . Just a goddamned bird . " " Like hell it was , " Frank said . " Just a lousy bird , " Wargle insisted . When the others disagreed , he said , " The bad light and all them shadows out there sort of give you a false impression . You did n't see what you all think you seen . " " And what do you think we saw ? " Tal asked him . Wargle 's face became flushed . " Did we see the same thing you saw , the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A moth ? Did you see one goddamned big , ugly impossible moth ? " Wargle looked down at his shoes . " I seen a bird . Just a bird . "  |p114Bryce  realised that Wargle was so utterly lacking in imagination that the man could n't encompass the possibility of the impossible , not even when he had witnessed it with his own eyes . " Where did it come from ? " Bryce asked . No one had any ideas . " What did it want ? " he asked . " It wanted us , " Lisa said . Everyone seemed to agree with that assessment . " But the thing at the window was n't what got Jake , " Frank said . " It was weak , lightweight . It could n't carry off a grown man . " " Then what got Jake ? " Gordy asked . " Something bigger , " Frank said . " Something a whole lot stronger and meaner . " Bryce decided that , after all , the time had come to tell them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone , between his calls to Governor Retlock and General Copperfield : the silent presence ; the forlorncries of sea gulls ; the warning sound of a rattlesnake ; worst of all , the agonizing and despairing screams of men , women , and children . He had n't intended to mention any of that until morning , until the arrival of daylight and reinforcements . But they might spot something important that he had missed , some scrap , some clue that would be of help . Besides , now that they had all seen the thing at the window , the phone incident was , by comparison , no longer very shocking . The others listened to Bryce , and this new information had a negative effect on their demeanor . " What kind of degenerate would tape-record the screams of his victims ? " Gordy asked . Tal Whitman shook his head . " It could be something else . It could be that ... " " Yes ? " " Well , maybe none of you wants to hear this right now . " " Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " Tal said , " what if it was n't a recording you heard ? I mean , we know people have disappeared from Snowfield . In fact as far as we 've seen , more have vanished than died . So . . . what if the missing are being held somewhere ? As hostages ? Maybe the screams were coming from people who were still alive , who were being tortured and maybe killed right then , right then while you were on the phone , listening . " Remembering those terrible screams , Bryce felt his marrow slowly freezing . " Whether it was tape-recorded or not , " Frank Autry said , " it 's probably a mistake to think in terms of hostages . "  | " Yes , " Dr. Paige said . " If Mr. Autry means that we 've got to be careful not to narrow our thinking to conventional situations , then I wholeheartedlyagree . This just does n't feel like a hostage drama . Something damned peculiar is happening here , something that no one 's ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 'd be more comfortable with cozy , familiar explanations . Besides , if we 're dealing with terrorists , how does that fit with the thing we saw at the window ? It does n't . " Bryce nodded . " You 're right . But I do n't believe Tal meant that people were being held for conventional motives . " " No , no , " Tal said . " It does n't have to be terrorists or kidnappers . Even if people are being held hostage , that does n't necessarily mean other people are holding them . I 'm even willing to consider that they 're being held by something that is n't human . How 's that for remaining open-minded ? Maybe it is holding them , the it that none of us can define . Maybe it 's holding them just to prolong the pleasure it takes from snuffing the life out of them . Maybe it 's holding them just to tease us with their screams , the way it teased Bryce on the phone . Hell , if we 're dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for holding hostages  --  if it is holding any  --  are bound to be incomprehensible . " " Christ , you 're talking like lunatics , " Wargle said . Everyone ignored him . They had stepped through the looking glass . The impossible was possible . The enemy was the unknown . Lisa Paige cleared her throat . Her face was pasty . In a barely audible voice , she said , " Maybe it spun a web somewhere , down in a dark place , in a cellar or a cave , and maybe it tied all the missing people into its web , sealed them up in cocoons , alive . Maybe it 's just saving them until it gets hungry again . " If absolutely nothing lay beyond the realm of possibility , if even the most outrageous theories could be true , then perhaps the girl was right , Bryce thought . Perhaps there was an enormous web vibrating softly in some dark place , hung with a hundred or two hundred or even more man- and woman- and child-size tidbits , wrapped in individual packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there living human beings who had been reduced to the awful equivalent of foil-wrapped Pop Tarts , waiting only to provide nourishment for some brutal , unimaginably evil , darkly intelligent , other-dimensional horror . No . Ridiculous . On the other hand : maybe . Jesus.  | Bryce crouched in front of the shortwave radio and squinted at its mangledguts . Circuit boards had been snapped . Several parts appeared to have been crushed in a vice or hammered flat . Frank said , " They had to take off the cover plate to get at all this stuff , just the way we did . " " So after they smashed the crap out of it , " Wargle said , " why 'd they bother to put the plate back on ? " " And why go to all that trouble to begin with ? " Frank wondered . " They could 've put the radio out of commission just by ripping the cord loose . " Lisa and Gordy appeared as Bryce was turning away from the radio . The girl said , " Food and coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm starved , " Wargle said , licking his lips . " We should all eat something , even if we do n't feel like it , " Bryce said . " Sheriff , " Gordy said , " Lisa and I have been wondering about the animals , the pets . What made us think about it was when you said you hearddog and cat sounds over the phone . Sir , what 's happened to all the pets ? " " Nobody 's seen a dog or cat , " Lisa said . " Or heard barking . " Thinking of the silent streets , Bryce frowned and said , " You 're right . It'sstrange . " " Jenny says there were some pretty big dogs in town . A few German shepherds . One Doberman that she knows of . Even a Great Dane . Would n't you think they 'd have fought back ? Would n't you think some of the dogs would 've gotten away ? " the girl asked . " Okay , " Gordy said quickly , anticipating Bryce 's response , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angry dog . Okay , so we also know that bullets did n't stop it , which says that maybe nothing can . It 's apparently big , and it 's strong . But , sir , big and strong do n't necessarily count for much with a cat . Cats are greased lightning . It 'd take something real damned sneaky to slip up on every cat in town . " " Real sneaky and real fast , " Lisa said . " Yeah , " Bryce said uneasily . " Real fast . " Jenny had just begun eating a sandwich when Sheriff Hammond sat down in a chair beside the desk , balancing his plate on his lap . " Mind some company ? " " Not at all . " " Tal Whitman 's been telling me you 're the scourge of our local motorcyclegang . " She smiled . " Tai 's exaggerating . " " That man does n't know how to exaggerate , " the sheriff said . " Let me tell you something about him . Sixteen months ago , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I got back , Tal was the first person I saw . I asked him if anything special had happened while I 'd been gone , and he said it was just the usual business with drunk drivers , bar fights , a couple of burglaries , various CITs  --  " " What 's a CIT ? " Jenny asked . " Oh , it 's just a cat-in-tree report . " " Policemen do n't really rescue cats , do they ? " " Do you think we 're heartless ? " he asked , feigning shock . " CITs ? Come on now . " He grinned . He had a marvelous grin . " Once every couple of months , we do have to get a cat out of a tree . But a CIT does n't mean just cats in trees . It 's our shorthand for any kind of nuisance call that takes us away from more important work . " " Ah  --  " So anyway , when I came back from Chicago that time , Tal told me it 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an afterthought , he said there 'd been an attempted robbery at a 7-Eleven . Tal had been a customer , out of uniform , when it went down . But even off duty , a cop 's required to carry his gun , and Tal had a revolver in an ankle holster . He told me one of the punks had been armed ; he said he 'd been forced to kill him , and he said I was n't to worry about whether it was a justified shooting or not . He said it was as justified as they come . When I got concerned about him , he said , Bryce . It was really just a cakewalk . ' Later , I found out the two punks had intended to shoot everyone . Instead , Tal shot the gunman  --  although not before he was shot himself . The punk put a bullet through Tal 's left arm , and just about a split second after that , Tal killed him . Tal 's wound was n't serious , but it bled like hell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't seen the bandage because it was under the shirt-sleeve , and Tal had n't bothered to mention it . So anyway , there 's Tal in the 7-Eleven , bleeding all over the place , and he discovers he 's out of amino . The second punk , who grabbed the gun the first one dropped , is also out of ammo , and he decides to run . Tal goes after him , and they have themselves a knock-down-drag-out fight from one end of that little grocery store to the other . The guy was two inches taller and twenty pounds heavier than Tal , and he was n't wounded . But you know what the backup officer told me they found when they arrived ? They said Tal was sitting up on the counter by the cash register , his shirt off , sipping a complimentary cup of coffee , while the clerk tried to stanch the flow of blood . One suspect was dead . The other one was unconscious , sprawled in a sticky mess of Hostess Twinkies and Fudge Fantasies and coconut cupcakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes right in the middle of the fight . About a hundred packages of snack stuff spilled ontop118the floor , and Tal and this other guy stepped all over them while they I+ ro grappling . Most of the packages broke open . There was icing and crumble cookies and smashed Twinkies all over one aisle . Staggered footprints we pressed right into the garbage , so that you could follow the progress of t battle just by looking at the sticky trail . " The sheriff finished his story and looked at Jenny expectantly . " Oh ! Yes , he told you it 'd been an easy arrest  --  just a cakewalk . " " Yeah . A cakewalk . " The sheriff laughed . Jenny glanced at Tal Whitman , who was across the room , eating a san wich , talking to Officer Brogan and to Lisa . " So you see , " the sheriff said , " when Tal tells me you 're the scourge e the Demon Chrome , I know he 's not exaggerating . Exaggeration just isn his style . " Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tal about my littl encounter with this man he calls Gene Ten , he acted as if he thought it w one of the bravest things anyone had ever done . Compared to th cakewalk ' of his , my story must 've seemed like a dispute on a kindergarte playground . " " No , no , " Hammond said . " Tal was n't just humoring you . He real ! does think you did a damned brave thing . So do I. Jeeter 's a snake , Dr. Paige . Poisonous variety . " " You can call me Jenny if you like . " " Well , Jenny-if-you-like , you can call me Bryce . " He had the bluest eyes she had ever seen . His smile was defined as much by those luminous eyes as it was by the curve of his mouth . As they ate , they talked about inconsequential things , as if this were an ordinary evening . He possessed an impressive ability to put people at ease regardless of the circumstances . He brought with him an aura of trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they finished eating , however , he guided the conversation back to the crisis at hand . " You know Snowfield better than I do . We 've got to find a suitable headquarters for this operation . This place is too small . Soon , I 'll have ten more men here . And Copperfield 's team in the morning . " " How many is he bringing ? " " At least a dozen people . Maybe as many as twenty . I need an HQ from which every aspect of the operation can be coordinated . We might be here for days , so there 'll have to be a room where off-duty people can sleep , and we 'll need a cafeteria arrangement to feed everyone . " " One of the inns might be just the place , " Jenny said . " Maybe . But I do n't want people sleeping two by two in a lot of different rooms . They 'd be too vulnerable . We 've got to set up a single dormitory " " Then the Hilltop Inn is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other side of the street . "  | " Oh , yeah , of course . Biggest hotel in town , is n't it ? " " Yeah . The Hilltop has a large lobby because it doubles as the hotel bar . " " I 've had a drink there once or twice . If we change the lobby furniture , it could be set up as a work area to accommodate everyone . " " There 's also a large restaurant divided into two rooms . One part could be a cafeteria , and we could carry mattresses down from the rooms and use the other half of the restaurant as a dorm . " Bryce said , " Let 's have a look at it . " He put his empty paper plate on the desk and got to his feet . Jenny glanced at the front windows . She thought of the strange creaturethat had flown into the glass , and in her mind she heard the soft yetfrenzied thumpthumpthumpthump . She said , " You mean . . . have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't it be wise to wait for the reinforcements ? " she asked e " They probably wo n't arrive for a while yet . There 's no point in just sitting around , twiddling our thumbs . We 'll all feel better if we 're doing something constructive ; it 'll take our minds off . . . the worst things we 've seen . " Jenny could n't free herself from the memory of those black insect eyes , so malevolent , so hungry . She stared at the windows , at the night beyond . The town no longer seemed familiar . It was utterly alien now , a hostile place in which she was an unwelcome stranger. a " We 're not one bit safer in here than we would be out there , " Bryce said gently . Jenny nodded , remembering the Oxleys in their barricaded room . As she got up from the desk , she said , " There 's no safety anywhere . " Bryce Hammond led the way out of the stationhouse . They crossed the moonlight-mottled cobblestones , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed into Skyline Road . Bryce carried a shotgun , as did Tal Whitman . The town was breathless . The trees stood unrespiring , and the buildingsp120were like vapor-thin mirages hanging on walls of air . Bryce moved out of the light , walked on moon-dappled pavement , crossingthe street , finding shadows scattered in the middle of it . Always shadows . The others came silently behind him . Something crunched under Bryce 's foot , startling him . It was a withered leaf . He could see the Hilltop Inn farther up Skyline Road . It was a fourstory , gray stone building almost a block away , and it was very dark . A few of the fourth-floor windows reflected the nearly full moon , but within the hotel not a single light burned . They had all reached or passed the middle of the street when something came out of the dark . Bryce was aware , first , of a moon shadow that fluttered across the pavement , like a ripple passing through a pool of water . Instinctively , he ducked . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Stu Wargle screamed . Bryce shot up from his crouch and whirled around . The moth . It was fixed firmly to Wargle 's face , holding on by some means not visible to Bryce . Wargle 's entire head was hidden by the thing . Wargle was n't the only one screaming . The others cried out and fell back in surprise . The moth was squealing , too , making a high-pitched , keening sound . In the moon 's silvery beams , the impossible insect 's huge pale velvety wings flapped and folded and spread with horrible grace and beauty , buffetingWargle 's head and shoulders . Wargle staggered away , veering downhill , moving blindly , clawing at the outrageous thing that clung to his face . His screams quickly grew muffled ; within a couple of seconds , they were silenced altogether . Bryce , like the others , was paralyzed by disgust and disbelief . Wargle began to run , but he only went a few yards before coming to an abrupt halt . His hands dropped away from the thing on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brief trance , Bryce dropped his useless shotgun and ran toward Stu . Wargle did n't crumple to the ground , after all . Instead , his shaky knees locked , and he snapped erect . His shoulders jerked back . His body twitched and shuddered as if an electric current had flashed through himBryce tried to grab the moth and tear it away from Wargle . But the deputy began to weave and thrash in a St. Vitus dance of pain and suffocation , and Bryce 's hands closed on empty air . Wargle moved erraticallyp121across the street , jerked this way and that , heaved and writhed and spun , as if he were attached to strings that were being manipulated by a drunken puppeteer . His hands hung slackly at his sides , which made his frantic and spasmodic capering seem especially eerie . His hands flopped and fluttered weakly , but they did not rise to tear at his assailant . It was almost as if , now , he were in the grip of ecstasy rather than the clutch of pain . Bryce followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get close . Then Wargle collapsed . In that same instant , the moth rose and turned , suspended in the air , hovering on rapidly beating wings , eye night-black and hateful . It swooped at Bryce . He stumbled backwards and threw his arms across his face . He fell . The moth sailed over his head . Bryce twisted around , looked up . The kite-size insect glided soundlessly across the street , toward the buildings on the other side . Tal Whitman raised his shotgun . The blast was like cannonfire in the silent town . The moth pitched sideways in midair . It tumbled in a loop , dropped almost to the ground , then it swooped up again and flew on , disappearing over a rooftop . Stu Wargle was sprawled on the pavement , flat on his back . Unmoving . Bryce scrambled to his feet and went to Wargle . The deputy lay in the middle of the street , where there was just enough light to see that his face was gone . Jesus . Gone . As if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scalp bristled over the white bone of his forehead . A skull peered up at Bryce . Tal , Gordy , Frank , and Lisa sat in red leatherette armchairs in a corner of the lobby of the Hilltop Inn . The inn had been closed since the end of the past skiing season , and they had removed the dusty white dropcloths from the chairs before collapsing into them , numb with shock . The oval coffee table was still covered by a dropcloth ; they stared at that shrouded object , unable to look at one another.  |p122At  the far end of the room , Bryce and Jenny were standing over the body of Stu Wargle , which lay on a long , low sideboard against the wall . No one in the armchairs could bring himself to look over that way . Staring at the covered coffee table , Tal said , " I shot the damned thing . I hit it . I know I did . " " We all saw it take the buckshot , " Frank agreed . " So why was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead-on by a blast from a 20-gauge . It should 've been torn to pieces , damn it . " " Guns are n't going to save us , " Lisa said . In a distant , haunted voice , Gordy said , " It could 've been any of us . That thing could 've gotten me . I was right behind Stu . If he had ducked or jumped out of the way ... " " No , " Lisa said . " No . It wanted Officer Wargle . Nobody else . Just Officer Wargle . " Tal stared at the girl . " What do you mean ? " Her flesh had taken paleness from her bones . " Officer Wargle refused to admit he 'd seen it when it was battering against the window . He insisted it was just a bird . " " So ? " " So it wanted him . Him especially , " she said . " To teach him a lesson . But mostly to teach us a lesson . " " It could n't have heard what Stu said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it could n't have understood . " " It did . " " I think you 're crediting it with too much intelligence , " Tal said . " It was big , yes , and like nothing any of us has ever seen before . But it was still only an insect . A moth . Right ? " The girl said nothing . " It 's not omniscient , " Tal said , trying to convince himself more than anyone else . " It 's not all-seeing , all-hearing , all-knowing . " The girl stared silently at the covered coffee table . Suppressing nausea , Jenny examined Wargle 's hideous wound . The lobby lights were not quite bright enough , so she used a flashlight to inspect the edges of the injury and to peer into the skull . The center of the dead man 's demolished face was eaten away clear to the bone ; all the skin , flesh , and cartilage were gone . Even the bone itself appeared to be partially dissolved in places , pitted , as if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was , however , normal flesh on all sides of the wound ; smooth untouched flesh lay along both sides of the face , from the outerp123points of the jawbones to the cheekbones , and there was unmarked skin from the midpoint of the chin on down , and from the midpoint of the forehead on up . It was as if some torture artist had designed a frame of healthy skin to set off the gruesome exhibition of bone on display in the center of the face . Having seen enough , Jenny switched off the flashlight . Earlier , they had covered the body with a dropcloth from one of the chairs . Now Jenny drew the sheet over the dead man 's face , relieved to be covering that skeletal grin . " Well ? " Bryce asked . " No teeth marks , " she said . " Would a thing like that have teeth ? " " I know it had a mouth , a small chitinous beak . I saw its mandibles working when it bashed itself against the substation windows . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mouth like that would mark the flesh . There 'd be slashes . Bite marks . Indications of chewing and tearing . " " But there were none ? " " No . The flesh does n't look as if it was ripped off . It seems to 've been ... dissolved . Along the edges of the wound , the remaining flesh is even sort of cauterized , as if it has been seared by something . " " You think that ... that insect . . secreted an acid ? " She nodded . " And dissolved Stu Wargle 's face ? " " And sucked up the liquefied flesh , " she said . " Oh , Jesus . " " Yes . " Bryce was as pale as an untinted deathmask , and his freckles seemed , by contrast , to burn and shimmer on his face . " That explains how it could 've done so much damage in only a few seconds . " Jenny tried not to think of the bony face peering out of the flesh  --  like a monstrous visage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood is gone , " she said . " All of it . " " What ? " " Was the body lying in a pool of blood ? " " No . " " There 's no blood on the uniform , either . " " I noticed that . " " There should be blood . He should 've spouted like a fountain . The eye sockets should be pooled with it . But there 's not a drop . " Bryce wiped one hand across his face . He wiped so hard , in fact , that some color rose in his cheeks.  | " Take a look at his neck , " she said . " The jugular . " He did n't move toward the corpse . She said , " And look at the insides of his arms and the backs of his hands . There 's no blueness of veins anywhere , no tracery . " " Collapsed blood vessels ? " " Yeah . I think all the blood is drained out of him . " Bryce took a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . We should have waited for reinforcements before leaving the substation  --  just like you said . " " No , no . You were right . It was no safer there than in the street . " " But he died in the street . " " Reinforcements would n't have made a bit of difference . The way that damned thing dropped out of the sky ... hell , not even an army could 've stopped it . Too quick . Too surprising . " Bleakness had taken up tenancy in his eyes . He felt his responsibility far too keenly . He was going to insist on blaming himself for his officer 's death . Reluctantly , she said , " There 's worse . " " Could n't be . " " His brain ... " Bryce waited . Then he said , " What ? What about his brain ? " " Gone . " " Gone ? " " His cranium is empty . Utterly empty . " " How can you possibly know that without opening  --  " She held out the flashlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the eye sockets . " He made no move to act upon her suggestion . His eyes were not hooded now . They were wide , startled . She noticed that she could n't hold the flashlight steady . Her hand was shaking violently . He noticed , too . He took the flash away from her and put it down on the sideboard , next to the shrouded corpse . He took both of her hands and held them in his own large , leathery , cupped hands ; he warmed them . She said , " There 's nothing beyond the eye sockets , nothing at all , nothing , nothing whatsoever , except the back of his skull . " Bryce rubbed her hands soothingly . " Just a damp , reamed-out cavity , " she said . As she spoke , her voice rose and cracked : " It ate through his face , right through his eyes , probably about as fast as he could blink , for God 's sake , ate into his mouth and took his tongue out by the roots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the roof of his mouth , Jesus , just consumed his brain , con/sumed all of the blood in his body , too , probably just sucked it up and out of him and  --  " " Easy , easy , " Bryce said . But the words rattle-clanked out of her as if they were links in a chain that bound her to an albatross : "  --  consumed all of that in no more than ten or twelve seconds , which is impossible , damn it to hell , plain impossible ! It devoured  --  do you understand ?  --  devoured pounds and pounds and pounds of tissue  --  the brain alone weighs six or seven pounds  --  devoured all of that in ten or twelve seconds ! " She stood gasping , hands trapped in his . He led her to a sofa that lay under a dusty white drape . They sat side by side . Across the room , none of the others was looking this way . Jenny was glad for that . She did n't want Lisa to see her in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke to her in a low , reassuring voice . She gradually grew calmer . Not less disturbed . Not less afraid . Just calmer . " Better ? " Bryce asked . " As my sister says  --  I guess I flaked out on you , huh ? " " Not at all . Are you kidding or what ? I could n't even take the flashlight from you and look in those eyes like you wanted me to . You 're the one who had the nerve to examine him . " " Well , thanks for getting me back together . You sure know how to knit up raveled nerves . " " Me ? I did n't do anything . " " You sure have a comforting way of doing nothing . " They sat in silence , thinking of things they did n't want to think about . Then he said , " That moth . . . " She waited . He said , " Where 'd it come from ? " " Hell ? " " Any other suggestions ? " Jenny shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When was that ? " " The age of dinosaurs . " His blue eyes flickered with interest . " Did moths like that exist back then ? " " I do n't know , " she admitted . " I can sort of picture it soaring through prehistoric swamps . " " Yeah . Preying on small animals , bothering a Tyrannosaurus rex about the same way our own tiny summer moths bother us. "  | " But if it 's from the Mesozoic , where 's it been hiding for the last hundredmillion years ? " he asked . More seconds , ticking . " Could it be . . . something from a genetic engineering lab ? " she wondered . " An experiment in recombinant DNA ? " " Have they gone that far ? Can they produce whole new species ? I only know what I read in the papers , but I thought they were years away from that sort of thing . They 're still working with bacteria . " " You 're probably right , " she said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moth is here . " After another silence , she said , " And what else is crawling or flying around out there ? " " You 're thinking about what happened to Jake Johnson ? " " Yeah . What took him ? Not the moth . Even as deadly as it is , it could n't kill him silently , and it could n't carry him away . " She sighed . " You know , at first I would n't try to leave town because I was afraid we 'd spread an epidemic . Now I would n't try to leave because I know we would n't make it out alive . We 'd be stopped . " " No , no . I 'm sure we could get you out , " Bryce said . " If we can prove there 's no disease-related aspect to this , if General Copperfield 's people can rule that out , then , of course , you and Lisa will be taken to safety right away . " She shook her head . " No . There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more formidable than the moth , and it does n't want us to leave . It wants to play with us before it kills us . It wo n't let any of us go , so we 'd damned well better find it and figure out how to deal with it before it gets tired of the game . " In both rooms of the Hilltop Inn 's large restaurant , chairs were stacked upside-down atop the tables , all covered with green plastic dropcloths . In the first room , Bryce and the others removed the plastic sheeting , took the chairs off the tables , and began to prepare the place to serve as a cafeteria . In the second room , the furniture had to be moved out to make way for the mattresses that would later be brought down from upstairs . They had only just begun emptying that part of the restaurant when they heard the faint but unmistakable sound of automobile engines . Bryce went to the French windows . He looked left , down the hill , towardthe foot of Skyline Road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red beacons flashing . " They 're here , " Bryce told the others . He had been thinking of the reinforcements as a reassuringly **27;10579;TOOLONG of their own decimated contingent . Now he realized that ten more men were hardly better than one more . Jenny Paige had been right when she 'd said that Stu Wargle 's life probablywould n't have been saved by waiting for reinforcements before leaving the substation . All the lights in the Hilltop Inn and all the lights along the main street flickered . Dimmed . Went out . But they came back on after only a second of darkness . It was 11:15 , Sunday night , counting down toward the witching hour . When midnight came to California , it was eight o'clock Monday morning in London . The day was dreary . Gray clouds melted across the city . A steady , dismal drizzle had been falling since before dawn . The drowned trees hung limply , and the streets glistened darkly , and everyone on the sidewalks seemed to have black umbrellas . At the Churchill Hotel in Portman Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , distorting the view from the dining room . Occasionally , brilliant flashes of lightning , passing through the waterbeadedwindowpanes , briefly cast shadowy images of raindrops onto the clean white tablecloths . Burt Sandler , in London on business from New York , sat at one of the window tables , wondering how in God 's name he was going to justify the size of this breakfast bill on his expense account . His guest had begun by ordering a bottle of good champagne : Mumm 's Extra Dry , which did n't come cheap . With the champagne , his guest wanted caviar  --  champagne and caviar for breakfast !  --  and two kinds of fresh fruit . And the old fellow clearly was not finished ordering . Across the table , Dr. Timothy Flyte , the object of Sandler 's amazement , studied the menu with childlike delight . To the waiter , he said , " And I should like an order of your croissants . " " Yes , sir , " the waiter said . " Are they very flaky ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . And eggs , " Flyte said . " Two lovely eggs , of course , rather soft , with buttered toast . " " Toast ? " the waiter asked . " Is that in addition to the two croissants , sir ? " " Yes , yes , " Flyte said , fingering the slightly frayed collar of his white shirt . " And a rasher of bacon with the eggs . " The waiter blinked . " Yes , sir . " At last Flyte looked up at Burt Sandler . " What 's breakfast without bacon ? Am I right ? " " I 'm an eggs-and-bacon man myself , " Burt Sandler agreed , forcing a smile . " Wise of you , " Flyte said sagely . His wire-rimmed spectacles had slipped down his nose and were now perched on the round , red tip of it . With a long , thin finger , he pushed them back into place . Sandler noticed that the bridge of the eyeglasses had been broken and soldered . The repair job was so distinctly amateurish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save money . " Do you have good pork sausages ? " Flyte asked the waiter . " Be truthful with me . I 'll send them back straightaway if they are n't of the highest quality . " " We 've quite good sausages , " the waiter assured him . " I 'm partial to them myself . " " Sausages , then . " " Is that in place of the bacon , sir ? " " No , no , no . In addition , " Flyte said , as if the waiter 's question was not only curious but a sign of thick-headedness . Flyte was fifty-eight but looked at least a decade older . His bristly white hair curled thinly across the top of his head and thrust out around his large ears as if crackling with static electricity . His neck was scrawny and wrinkled ; his shoulders were slight ; his body favored bone and cartilage over flesh . There was some legitimate doubt whether he could actually eat all that he had ordered . " Potatoes , " Flyte said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbling it down on his order pad , on which he had very nearly run out of room to write . " Do you have suitable pastries ? " Flyte inquired . The waiter , a model of deportment under the circumstances , having made not the slightest allusion to Flyte 's amazing gluttony , looked at Burt Sandler as if to say : Is your grandfather hopelessly senile , sir , or is he , at his age , a marathon runner who needs the calories ? Sandler merely smiled  |p129To  Flyte , the waiter said , " Yes , sir , we have several pastries . There 's a delicious  --  " " Bring an assortment , " Flyte said . " At the end of the meal , of course . " " Leave it to me , sir . " " Good . Very good . Excellent ! " Flyte said , beaming . Finally , with a trace of reluctance , he relinquished his menu . Sandler almost sighed with relief . He asked for orange juice , eggs , bacon , and toast , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his somewhat shiny blue suit . As Sandler finished ordering , Flyte leaned toward him conspiratorially . " Will you be having some of the champagne , Mr. Sandler ? " " I believe I might have a glass or two , " Sandler said , hoping the bubbly would liberate his mind and help him formulate a believable explanation for this extravagance , a likely tale that would convince even the parsimoniousclerks in accounting who would be poring over this bill with an electron microscope . Flyte looked at the waiter . " Then perhaps you 'd better bring two bottles . " Sandler , who was sipping ice-water , nearly choked . The waiter left , and Flyte looked out through the rain-streaked window beside their table . " Nasty weather . Is it like this in New York in autumn ? " " We have our share of rainy days . But autumn can be beautiful in New York . " " Here , too , " Flyte said . " Though I rather imagine we have more days like this than you . London 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor insisted on small talk until the champagne and caviar were served , as if he feared that , once business had been discussed , Sandler would quickly cancel the rest of the breakfast order . He 's a character out of Dickens , Sandler thought . As soon as they had proposed a toast , wishing each other good fortune , and had sipped the Mumm 's , Flyte said , " So you 've come all the way from New York to see me , have you ? " His eyes were merry . " To see a number of writers , actually , " Sandler said . " I make the trip once a year . I scout out books in progress . British authors are popular in the States , especially thriller writers . " " MacLean , Follet , Forsythe , Bagley , that crowd ? " " Yes , very popular , some of them . " The caviar was superb . At the professor 's urging , Sandler tried some of it with chopped onions . Flyte piled gobs on small wedges of dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm not only scouting for thrillers , " Sandler said . " I 'm after ap130variety of books . Unknown authors , too . And I suggest projects on occasion , when I have a subject for a particular author . " " Apparently , you have something in mind for me . " " First , let me say I read The Ancient Enemy when it was first published , and I found it fascinating . " " A number of people found it fascinating , " Flyte said . " But most found it infuriating . " " I hear the book created problems for you . " " Virtually nothing but problems . " " Such as ? " " I lost my university position fifteen years ago , at the age of forty-three , when most academics are achieving job security . " " You lost your position because of The Ancient Enemy ? " " They did n't put it quite that bluntly , " Flyte said , popping a morsel of caviar into his mouth . " That would have made them seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of my department , and most of my distinguished colleagues chose to attack indirectly . My dear Mr. Sandler , the competition among power-mad politicians and the **25;10608;TOOLONG of junior executives in a major corporation are as nothing , in terms of ruthlessness and spitefulness , when compared to the behavior of academic types who suddenly see an opportunity to climb the university ladder at the expense of one of their own . They spread rumors without foundation , scandalous tripe about my sexual preferences , suggestionsof intimate fraternization with my female students . And with my male students , for that matter . None of those slanders was openly discussed in a forum where I could refute them . Just rumors . Whispered behind the back . Poisonous . More openly , they made polite suggestions of incompetence , overwork , mental fatigue . I was eased out , you see ; that 's how they thought of it , though there was nothing easy about it from my point of view . Eighteen months after the publication of The Ancient Enemy , I was gone . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsavory reputation . The true reason , of course , was that my theories were too bizarre for academic tastes . I stood accused of attempting to make a fortune by pandering to the common man 's taste for pseudoscience and sensationalism , of selling my credibility . " Flyte paused to take some champagne , savoring it . Sandler was genuinely appalled by what Flyte had told him . " But that 's outrageous ! Your book was a scholarly treatise . It was never aimed at the best-seller lists . The common man would 've had enormous difficulty wadingthrough The Ancient Enemy . Making a fortune from that kind of work is virtually impossible . "  | " A fact to which my royalty statements can attest , " Flyte said . He finishedthe last of the caviar . " You were a respected archaeologist , " Sandler said . " Oh , well , never really all that respected , " Flyte said self-deprecatingly . " Though I was certainly never an embarrassment to my profession , as was so often suggested later on . If my colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's because you do n't understand the nature of the animal . I mean , the scientist animal . Scientists are educated to believe that all new knowledge comes in tiny increments , grains of sand piled one on another . Indeed , that is how most knowledge is gained . Therefore , they are never prepared for those visionaries who arrive at new insights which , overnight , utterly transform an entire field of inquiry . Copernicus was ridiculed by his contemporaries for believing that the planets revolved around the sun . Of course , Copernicus was proved right . There are countlessexamples in the history of science . " Flyte blushed and drank some more champagne . " Not that I compare myself to Copernicus or any of those other great men . I 'm simply trying to explain why my colleagues were conditioned to turn against me . I should have seen it coming . " The waiter came to take away the caviar dish . He also served Sandler 's orange juice and Flyte 's fresh fruit . When he was alone with Flyte again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had validity ? " " Absolutely ! " Flyte said . " I am right ; or at least there 's an awfully good chance I am . History is filled with mysterious mass disappearances for which historians and archaeologists can provide no viable explanation . " The professor 's rheumy eyes became sharp and probing beneath his bushy white eyebrows . He leaned over the table , fixing Burt Sandler with a hypnotic stare . " On December 10 , 1939 , " Flyte said , " outside the hills of Nanking , an army of three thousand Chinese soldiers , on its way to the front lines to fight the Japanese , simply vanished without a trace before it got anywhere near the battle . Not a single body was ever found . Not one grave . Not one witness . The Japanese military historians have never found any record of having dealt with that particular Chinese force . In the countryside through which the missing soldiers passed , no peasants heard gunfire or other indicationsof conflict . An army evaporated into thin air . And in 1711 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out on an expeditioninto the Pyrenees . Every last man disappeared on familiar and friendly ground , before the first night 's camp was established ! " Flyte was still as gripped by his subject as he had been when he had written his book , seventeen years ago . His fruit and champagne werep132forgotten . He stared at Sandler as if daring him to challenge the infamous Flyte theories . " On a grander scale , " the professor continued , " consider the great Mayan cities of Copan , Piedras Negras , Palenque , Menches , Seibal , and several others which were abandoned overnight . Tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of Mayans left their homes , approximately in A.D. 610 , perhaps within a single week , even within one day . Some appear to have flat northward , to establish new cities , but there is evidence that countless thousands just disappeared . All within a shockingly brief span of time Ihcy did n't bother to take many of their pots , tools , cooking utensils ... My learned colleagues say the land around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people move north , where the land would be more productive . But if this great exodus was planned , why were belongings left behind ? Why was precious seed corn left behind ? Why did n't a single survivor ever return to loot those cities of their abandoned treasures ? " Flyte softly struck the table with one fist . " It 's irrational ! Emigrants do n't set out on long , arduous journeys without preparation , without taking every tool that might assist them . Besides , in some of the homes in Piedras Negras and Seibal , there is evidence that families departed after preparing elaborate dinners  --  but before eating them . This would surely seem to indicate that their leaving was sudden . No current theories adequately answer these questions  --  except mine , bizarre as it is , odd as it is , impossible as it is . " " Frightening as it is , " Sandler added . " Esactly , " Flyte said . The professor sank back in his chair , breathless . He noticed his champagne glass , seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiter appeared and refilled their glasses . Flyte quickly consumed his fruit , as if afraid the waiter might spirit it away whllc the hothouse strawberries remained untouched . Sandler felt sorry for the old bird . Evidently , it had been quite some time since the professor had been treated to an expensive meal served in an elegant atmosphere . " I was accused of trying to explain every mysterious disappearance from the Mayans to Judge Crater and Amelia Earhart , all with a single theory . That was most unfair . I never mentioned the judge or the luckless aviatrix . I am interested only in unexplained mass disappearances of both humankindand animals , of which there have been literally hundreds throughout history . " The waiter brought croissants . Outside , lightning stepped quickly down the somber sky and put its spiked foot to the earth in another part of the city ; its blazing descent wasp133accompanied by a terrible crash and roar that echoed across the entire firmament . Sandler said , " If , subsequent to the publication of your book , there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent considerable ctedibility  --  " " Ah , " Flyte interrupted , tapping the table emphatically with one stiff finger , " but there have been such disappearances ! " " But surely they would have been splashed all over the front page  --  " " I am aware of two instances . There may be others , " Flyte insisted . " One of them involved the disappearance of masses of lower lifeformsspecifically , fish . It was remarked on in the press , but not with any great Interest . Politics , murder , sex , and two-headed goats are the only things newspapers care to report about . You have to read scientific journals to know what 's really happening . That 's how I know that , eight years ago , marine biologists noted a dramatic decrease in fish populations in one region of the Pacific . Indeed , the numbers of some species had been cut in half . Within certain scientific circles , there was panic at first , some fear that ocean temperatures might be undergoing a sudden change that would depopulatethe seas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the case . Gradually , sea life in that area  --  which covered hundreds of square miles replenished itself . In the end no one could explain what had happened to the millions upon millions of creatures that had vanished . " " Pollution , " Sandler suggested , between alternating sips of orange juice and champagne . Dabbing marmalade on a piece of croissant , Flyte said , " No , no , no . No , sir . It would have required the most massive case of water pollution in history to cause such a devastating depopulation over that wide an area . An accident on that scale could not go unnoticed . But there were no accidents , no oil spills  --  nothing . Indeed , a mere oil spill could not have accounted for it ; the affected region and the volume of water was too vast for that . And dead fish did not wash up on the beaches . They merely vanished without a trace . " Burt Sandler was excited . He could smell money . He had hunches about some books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Well , except for that diet book by the movie star who , a week before publication day , died of malnutrition after subsisting for six months on little more than grapefruit , papaya , raisin toast , and carrots . ) There was a surefire bestsellerin this : two or three hundred thousand copies in hardcover , perhaps even more ; two million in paperback . If he could persuade Flyte to popularizeand update the dry academic material in The Ancient Enemy , the professor would be able to afford his own champagne for many years to come.  | " You said you were aware of two mass disappearances since the publica- tion of your book , " Sandler said , encouraging him to continue . " The other was in Africa in 1980 . Between three and four thousand primitive tribesmen  --  men , women , and children  --  vanished from a rela- tively remote area of central Africa . Their villages were found empty ; they had abandoned all their possessions , including large stores of food . They seemed to have just run off into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken pieces of pottery . Of course , mass disappearances in that partof the world are dismayingly more frequent than they once were , primarily due to political violence . Cuban mercenaries , operating with Soviet weap- onry , have been assisting in the liquidation of whole tribes that are unwill- ing to put their ethnic identities second to the revolutionary purpose . But when entire villages are slaughtered for political purposes , they are always looted , then burned , and the bodies are always interred in mass graves There was no looting in this instance , no burning , no bodies to be found . Some weeks later , game wardens in that district reported an inexplicable decrease in the wildlife population . No one connected it to the missing villagers ; it was reported as a separate phenomenon . " " But you know differently . " " Well , I suspect differently , " Flyte said , putting strawberry jam on a last bit of croissant . " Most of these disappearances seem to occur in remote areas , " Sandler said . " Which makes verification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face as well . Actually , most incidents probably occur at sea , for the sea covers the largest part of the earth . The sea can be as remote as the moon , and much of what takes place beneath the waves is beyond our notice . Yet do n't forget the two armies I mentioned  --  theChinese and Spanish . Those disappearances took place within the context of modern civilization . And if tens of thousands of Mayans fell victim to the ancient enemy whose existence I 've theorized , then that was a case in which entire cities , hearts of civilization , were attacked with frightening boldness . " " You think it could happen now , today  --  " " No question about it ! " "  --  in a place like New York or even here in London ? " " Certainly ! It could happen virtually anywhere that has the geological underpinnings I outlined in my book . " They both sipped champagne , thinking . The rain hammered on the windows with greater fury than before . Sandler was not certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enemy . He knew they could form the basis for a wildly successful book written in a popular vein , but that did n't mean hep135had to believe in them . He did n't really want to believe . Believing was like opening the door to Hell . He looked at Flyte , who was straightening his wilted carnation again , and he said , " It gives me the chills . " " It should , " Flyte said , nodding . " It should . " The waiter came with the eggs , bacon , sausages , and toast . The inn was a fortress . Bryce was satisfied with the preparations that had been made . At last , after two hours of arduous labor , he sat down at a table in the cafeteria , sipping decaffeinated coffee from a white ceramic mug on which was emblazoned the blue crest of the hotel . By one-thirty in the morning , with the help of the ten deputies who had arrived from Santa Mira , much had been accomplished . One of the two rooms had been converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , enough to accommodate any single shift of the investigativeteam , even after General Copperfield 's people arrived . In the other half of the restaurant , a couple of buffet tables had been set up at one end , where a cafeteria line could be formed at mealtimes . The kitchen had been cleaned and put in order . The large lobby had been converted into an enormous operations center , with desks , makeshift desks , typewriters , filingcabinets , bulletin boards , and a big map of Snowfield . Furthermore , the inn had been given a thorough security inspection , and steps had been taken to prevent a break-in by the enemy . The two rear entrances  --  one through the kitchen , one through the lobby  --  were locked , and additionally secured with slanted two-by-fours , which were wedged under the crashbars and nailed to the frames ; Bryce had ordered that extra precaution to avoid wasting guards at those entrances . The door to the emergency stairs was similarly sealed off ; nothing could enter the higher floors of the hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of small elevators connected the lobby level to the three upper floors , and two guards were stationed there . Another guard stood at the front entrance . A detail of four men had ascertained that all upstairs rooms werep136empty . Another detail had determined that all of the ground-floor windows were locked ; most of them were painted shut , as well . Nevertheless , the windows were points of weakness in their fortifications . At least , Bryce thought , if anything tries to get inside through a window . we 'll have the sound of breaking glass to warn us . A host of other details had been attended to . Stu Wargle 's mutilated corpse had been temporarily stored in a utility room that adjoined the lobby . Bryce had drawn up a duty roster , and had structured twelve-hour work shifts for the next three days , should the crisis last that long . Finally , he could n't think of anything more that could be done until first light . Now he sat alone at one of the round tables in the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night 's events . His mind kept circling back to one unwanted thought : His brain was gone . His blood was sucked out of him -- every damned drop . He shook off the sickening image of Wargle 's ruined face , got up , went for more coffee , then returned to the table . The inn was very quiet . At another table , three of the nightshift men  --  Miguel Hernandez , Sam Potter , and Henry Wong  --  were playing cards , but they were n't talking much . When they did speak , it was almost in whispers . The inn was very quiet . The inn was a fortress . The inn was a fortress , damn it . But was it safe ? Lisa chose a mattress in a corner of the dormitory , where her back would be up against a blank wall . Jenny unfolded one of the two blankets stacked at the foot of the mattress , and draped it over the girl . " Want the other one ? " " No , " Lisa said . " This 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed with all my clothes on . " " Things 'll get back to normal pretty soon , " she said , but even as she spoke she realized how inane that statement was . " Are you going to sleep now ? " " Not quite yet . " " I wish you would , " Lisa said . " I wish you 'd lay down right there on the next mattress . " " You 're not alone , honey . " Jenny smoothed the girl 's hair.  |p137A  few deputies  --  including Tal Whitman , Gordy Brogan , and Frank Autry  --  had bedded down on other mattresses . There were also three heavily armed guards who would watch over everyone throughout the night . " Will they turn the lights down any farther ? " Lisa asked . " No . We ca n't risk darkness . " " Good . They 're dim enough . Will you stay with me until I fall asleep ? " Lisa asked , seeming much younger than fourteen . " Sure . " " And talk to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we do n't disturb anyone . " Jenny lay down beside her sister , her head propped up on one hand . " What do you want to talk about ? " " I do n't care . Anything . Anything except . . . tonight . " " Well , there is something I want to ask you , " Jenny said . " It 's not about tonight , but it 's about something you said tonight . Remember when we were sitting on the bench in front of the jail , waiting for the sheriff ? Remember how we were talking about Mom , and you said Mom used to ... used to brag about me ? " Lisa smiled . " Her daughter , the doctor . Oh , she was so proud of you , Jenny . " As it had done before , that statement unsettled Jenny . " And Mom never blamed me for Dad 's stroke ? " she asked . Lisa frowned . " Why would she blame you ? " " Well . . . because I guess I caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of worry . " " You ? " Lisa asked , astonished . " And when Dad 's doctor could n't control his high blood pressure and then he had a stroke  --  " " According to Mom , the only thing you ever did bad in your entire life was when you decided to give the calico cat a black dye job for Halloween and you got Clairol all over the sun porch furniture . " Jenny laughed with surprise . " I 'd forgotten that . I was only eight years old . " They smiled at each other , and in that moment they felt more than ever like sisters . Then Lisa said , " Why 'd you think Mom blamed you for Daddy 's dying ? It was natural causes , was n't it ? A stroke . How could it possibly have been your fault ? " Jenny hesitated , thinking back thirteen years to the start of it . That her mother had never blamed her for her father 's death was a profoundlyp138liberating realization . She felt free for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mmmm ? " " Are you crying ? " " No , I 'm okay , " she said , fighting back tears . " If Mom did n't hold it against me , I guess I 've been wrong to hold it against myself . I 'm just happy , honey . Happy about what you 've told me . " " But what was it you thought you did ? If we 're going to be good sisters , we should n't keep secrets . Tell me , Jenny . " " It 's a long story , Sis . I 'll tell you about it eventually , but not now . Now I want to hear all about you . " They talked about trivialities for a few minutes , and Lisa 's eyes grew steadily heavier . Jenny was reminded of Bryce Hammond 's gentle , hooded eyes . And of Jakob and Aida Liebermann 's eyes , glaring out of their severed heads . And Deputy Wargle 's eyes . Gone . Those burnt-out , empty sockets in that hollow skull . She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too-well-remembered , grim reaper 's gaze . But her mind kept circling back to that image of monstrous violence and death . She wished there were someone to talk her to sleep as she was doing for Lisa . It was going to be a restless night . In the utility room that adjoined the lobby and backed up against the elevator shaft , the light was off . There were no windows . A faint odor of cleaning fluids clung to the place . Pinesol . Lysol . Furniturepolish . Floor wax . Janitorial supplies were stored on shelves along one wall . In the right-hand corner , farthest from the door , was a large metal sink . Water dripped from a leaky faucet  --  one drop every ten or twelve seconds . Each pellet of water struck the metal basin with a soft , hollow ping . In the center of the room , as shrouded in utter blackness as was everything else , the faceless body of Stu Wargle lay on a table , covered by a dropcloth . All was still . Except for the monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air.  |p139Frank  Autry huddled under the blanket , his eyes closed , and he thought about Ruth . Tall , willowy , sweet-faced Ruthie . Ruthie with the quiet yet crisp voice , Ruthie with the throaty laugh that most people found infectious , his wife of twenty-six years : She was the only woman he had ever loved ; he still loved her . He had spoken with her by telephone for a few minutes , just before turning in for the night . He had not been able to tell her much about what was happening  --  just that there was a siege situation underway in Snowfield , that it was being kept quiet as long as possible , and that by the look of it he would n't be home tonight . Ruthie had n't pressed him for details . She had been a good army wife through all his years in the service . She still was . Thinking of Ruth was his primary psychological defense mechanism . In times of stress , in times of fear and pain and depression , he simply thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife-filled world faded . For a man who had spent so much of his life engaged in dangerous work  --  for a man whose occupations had seldom allowed him to forget that death was an intimate part of life , a woman like Ruth was indispensable medicine , an inoculation against despair . Gordy Brogan was afraid to close his eyes again . Each time that he had closed them , he had been plagued by bloody visions that had rolled up out of his own private darkness . Now he lay under his blanket , eyes open , staring at Frank Autry 's back . In his mind , he composed his letter of resignation to Bryce Hammond . He would n't be able to type and submit that letter until after this Snowfield business was settled . He did n't want to leave his buddies in the middle of a battle ; that did n't seem right . He might actually be of some help to them , considering that it did n't appear as if he would be required to shoot at people . However , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were back in Santa Mira , he would write the letter and hand-deliver it to the sheriff . He had no doubt about it now : police work was not  --  and never had been  --  for him . He was still a young man ; there was time to change careers . He had become a cop partly as an act of rebellion against his parents , for it had been the last thing they had wanted . They 'd noted his uncanny way with animals , his ability to win the trust and friendship of any creature on four legs within about half a minute flat , and they had hoped he would become a veterinarian . Gordy had always felt smothered by his mother 's and father'sp140unflagging affection , and when they had nudged him toward a career in veterinary medicine , he had rejected the possibility . Now he saw that they were right and that they only wanted what was best for him . Indeed , deep down , he had always known they were right . He was a healer , not a peacekeeper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badge because being a cop had seemed a good way of proving his masculinity . In spite of his formidable size and muscles , in spite of his acute interest in women , he had always believed that others thought of him as androgynous . As a boy , he had never been interested in sports , which had obsessed all of his male contemporaries . And endless talk about hotrods had simply bored him . His interests lay elsewhere and , to some , seemed effete . Although his talent was only average , he enjoyed painting . He played the French horn . Nature fascinated him , and he was an avid bird-watcher . His abhorrence of violence had not been acquired as an adult ; even as a child , he had avoided confrontations . His pacifism , when considered with his reticence in the company of girls , had made him appear , at least to himself , somewhat less than manly . But now , at long last , he saw that he did not need to prove anything , He would go to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks would be happy , too . His life would be on the right track again . He closed his eyes , sighing , seeking sleep . But out of darkness came nightmarish images of the severed heads of cats and dogs , flesh-crawling images of dismembered and tortured animals . He snapped his eyes open , gasping . What had happened to all the pets in Snowfield ? The utility room , off the lobby . Windowless , lightless . The monotonous ping of water dropping into the metal sink had stopped . But there was n't silence now . Something moved in the darkness . It made a soft , wet , stealthy sound as it crept around the pitch-black room . Not yet ready to sleep , Jenny went into the cafeteria , poured a cup of coffee , and joined the sheriff at a corner table . " Lisa sleeping ? " he asked . " Like a rock . " " How 're you holding up ? This must be hard on you . All your neighbors , friends ... "  | " It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just sort of numb . If I let If react to every death that 's had an effect on me , I 'd be a blubbering . So I 've just let my emotions go numb . " " It 's a normal , healthy response . That 's how we 're all dealing with it . " They drank some coffee , chatted a bit . Then : " Married ? " he asked . " No . You ? " " I was . " " Divorced ? " " She died . " " Oh , Christ , of course . I read about it . I 'm sorry . A year ago , was n't it ? A traffic accident ? " " A runaway truck . " She was looking into his eyes , and she thought they clouded and became less blue than they had been . " How 's your son doing ? " " He 's still in a coma . I do n't think he 'll ever come out of it . " " I 'm sorry , Bryce . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug and stared down at the coffee . " With Timmy like he is , it 'll be a blessing , really , when he just finally lets go . I was numb about it for a while . I could n't feel anything , not just emotionally but physically , as well . At one point I cut my finger while I was slicing an orange , and I bled all over the damned kitchen and even ate a few bloody sections of the orange before I noticed that something was wrong . Even then I never felt any pain . Lately , I 've been coming around to an understanding , to an acceptance . " He looked up and met Jenny 's eyes . " Strangely enough , since I 've been here in Snowfield , the grayness has gone away . " " Grayness ? " " For a long time , the color has been leeched out of everything . It 's all been gray . But tonight  --  just the opposite . Tonight , there 's been so much excitement , so much tension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then Jenny spoke of her mother 's death , of the surprisingly powerful effect it had had on her , despite the twelve years of partial estrangement that should have softened the blow . Again , Jenny was impressed by Bryce Hammond 's ability to make her feel at ease . They seemed to have known each other for years . She even found herself telling him about the mistakes she had made in her eighteenth and nineteenth years , about her naive and stubbornly wrongheaded behavior that had grievously hurt her parents . Toward the end of her first year in college , she had met a man who had captivated her . He was a graduate student  --  Campbell Hudson ; she called him Cam  --  fivep142years her senior . His attentiveness , charm , and passionate pursuit of hell had swept her away . Until then , she had led a sheltered life ; she had never tied herself down to one steady boyfriend , had never really dated heavily at all . She was an easy target . Having fallen for Cam Hudson , she then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciple and , very nearly , his devoted slave . " I ca n't see you subjugating yourself to anyone , " Bryce said . " I was young . " " Always an acceptable excuse . " She had moved in with Cam , taking insufficient measures to conceal her sinning from her mother and father ; and sinning was how they saw it Later , she decided  --  rather , she allowed Cam to decide for her  --  that she would drop out of college and work as a waitress , helping pay his bills until he was finished with his master 's and doctoral work . Once trapped in Cam Hudson 's self-serving scenario , she gradually found him less attentive and less charming than he had once been . She learned he had a violent temper . Then her father died while she was still with Cam , and at the funeral she sensed that her mother blamed her for his untimely passing . Within a month of the day that her father was consigned to the grave , she learned she was pregnant . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted on a quick abortion . She asked for a day to consider , but he became enraged at even a twenty-four-hour delay . He beat her so severely that she had a miscarriage . It was over then . The foolishness was over . She grew up suddenly  --  although her abrupt coming of age was too late to please her father . " Since then , " she told Bryce , " I 've spent my life working hard  --  maybe too hard  --  to prove to my mother that I was sorry and that I was , after all , worthy of her love . I 've worked weekends , turned down countless party invitations , skipped most vacations for the past twelve years , all in the name of bettering myself . I did n't go home as often as I should have done . I could n't face my mother . I could see the accusation in her eyes . And then tonight , from Lisa , I learned the most amazing thing . " " Your mother never blamed you , " Bryce said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in him before . " Yes ! " Jenny said . " She never held anything against me . " " She was probably even proud of you . " " Yes ; again ! She never blamed me for Dad 's death . It was me doing all the blaming . The accusation I thought I saw in her eyes was only a reflection of my own guilty feelings . " Jenny laughed softly and sourly , shaking her head . " It 'd be funny if it was n't so damned sad . " In Bryce Hammond 's eyes , she saw the sympathy and understanding for which she had been searching ever since her father 's funeral.  |p143Fir  said , " We 're a lot alike in some ways , you and I. I think we both have rtyr complexes . " " No more , " she said . " Life 's too short . That 's something that 's been ught home to me tonight . From now on I 'm going to live , really live  --  if owfield will let me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I could feel sure of that . " Bryce said , " You know , having something to look forward to will help us ake it . So how about giving me something to look forward to ? " " Huh ? " " A date . " He leaned forward . His thick , sandy hair fell into his eyes . " Gervasio 's Ristorante in Santa Mira . Minestrone . Scampi in garlic butter . Some good veal or maybe a steak . A side dish of pasta . They make a wonderful vermicelli al pesto . Good wine . " She grinned . " I 'd love it . " " I forgot to mention the garlic bread . " " Oh , I love garlic bread . " " Zabaglione for dessert . " " They 'll have to carry us out , " she said . " We 'll arrange for wheelbarrows . " They chatted for a couple of minutes , relieving tension , and then both of them were finally ready to sleep . Ping . In the dark utility room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water had begun to drop into the metal sink again . Ping . Something continued to move stealthily in the darkness , around and around the table . It made a slick , wet , **26;10635;TOOLONG noise . That was n't the only sound in the room ; there were many other noises , all soft and low . The panting of a weary dog . The hiss of an angry cat . Quiet , silvery , haunting laughter ; the laughter of a small child . Then a woman 's pained whimpering . A moan . A sigh . The chirruping of a swallow , rendered clearly but softly , so as not to draw the attention of any of the guards posted out in the lobby . The warning of a rattlesnake . The humming of bumblebees . The higher-pitched , sinister buzzing of wasps . A dog growling . The noises ceased as abruptly as they had begun . Silence returned . Ping.  |p144The  quiet lasted , unbroken except for the regularly spaced notes of falling water , for perhaps a minute . Ping . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over W gle 's corpse . The shroud had slipped off the dead man and had fallen to floor . Slithering again . And a dry-wood splintering sound . A brittle , muffled but violent sound . A hard , sharp bonecrack . Silence again . Ping . Silence . Ping . Ping . Ping . While Tal Whitman waited for sleep , he thought about fear . That was the key word ; it was the foundry emotion that had forged him . Fear . His life was one long vigorous denial of fear , a refutation of its very existence . He refused to be affected by  --  humbled by , driven by  --  fear . He would not admit that anything could scare him . Early in his life , hard experience had taught him that even acknowledgment of fear could expose him to its voracious appetite . He had been born and raised in Harlem , where fear was everywhere : fear of street gangs , fear of junkies , fear of random violence , fear of economic privation , fear of being excluded from the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , fear waited to gobble you up the instant you gave it the slightest nod of recognition . In childhood , he had not been safe even in the apartment that he had shared with his mother , one brother , and three sisters . Tal 's father had been a sociopath , a wife-beater , who had shown up once or twice a month merely for the pleasure of slapping his woman senseless and terrorizing his children . Of course , Mama had been no better than the old man . She drank too much wine , tooted too much dope , and was nearly as ruthless with her children as their father was . When Tal was nine , on one of the rare nights when his father was home , a fire swept the tenement house . Tal was his family 's sole survivor . Mama and the old man had died in bed , overcome by smoke in their sleep . Tal 's brother , Oliver , and his sisters  --  Heddy , Louisa , and baby Francesca  --  were lost , and now all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever really existed . After the fire , he was taken in by his mother 's sister , Aunt Rebecca . She lived in Harlem , too . Becky did n't drink . She did n't use dope . She had nop145ltdren of her own , but she did have a job , and she went to night school , she believed in self-sufficiency , and she had high hopes . She often told that there was nothing to fear but Fear Itself and that Fear Itself wasIke the boogeyman , just a shadow , not worth fearing at all . " God madehealthy , Talbert , and He gave you a good brain . Now if you mess up , ' a nobody 's fault but your own . " With Aunty Becky 's love , discipline , and suidance , young Talbert had eventually come to think of himself as virtuallyinvincible . He was not scared of anything in life ; he was not scared of dying , either . That was why , years later , after surviving the shoot-out in the 7-Eleven store over in Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been a mere cakewalk . Now , for the first time in a long , long string of years , he had come across a knot of fear . Tal thought of Stu Wargle , and the knot of fear pulled tighter , squeezing his guts . The eyes were eaten right out of his skull . Fear Itself . But this boogeyman was real . Half a year from his thirty-first birthday , Tal Whitman was discovering that he could still be afraid , regardless of how strenuously he denied it . His fearlessness had brought him a long way in life . But , in opposition to all that he had believed before , he realized that there were also times when being afraid was merely being smart . Shortly before dawn , Lisa woke from a nightmare she could n't recall . She looked at Jenny and the others who were sleeping , then turned toward the windows . Outside , Skyline Road was deceptively peaceful as the end of night drew near . Lisa had to pee . She got up and walked quietly between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at the guard , and he winked . One man was in the dining room . He was paging through a magazine . In the lobby , two guards were stationed by the elevator doors . The two polished oak front doors of the inn , each with an oval of beveled glass in the center of it , were locked , but a third guard was positioned by that entrance . He was holding a shotgun and staring out through one of the ovals , watching the main approach to the building . A fourth man was in the lobby . Lisa had met him earlier  --  a bald , floridfacedeputy named Fred Turpner . He was sitting at the largest desk , monitoringthe telephone . It must have rung frequently during the night , for a couple of legal-size sheets of paper were filled with messages . As Lisap146passed by , the phone rang again . Fred raised one hand in greeting , then snatched up the receiver . Lisa went directly to the restrooms , which were tucked into one corner of the lobby : SNOW BUNNIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hilltop Inn . She pushed through the door marked SNOW BUNNIES . The restrooms had been judged safe territory because they had no windows and could be entered only through the lobby , where there were always guards . The women 's room was large and clean , with four stalls and sinks . The floors and walls were covered with white ceramic tile bordered by dark blue tile around the edge of the floor and around the top of the walls . Lisa used the first stall and then the nearest sink . As she finished washing her hands and looked up at the mirror above the sink , she saw him . Him . The dead deputy . Wargle . He was standing behind her , eight or ten feet away , in the middle of the room . Grinning . She swung around , sure that somehow it was a flaw in the mirror , a trick of the looking glass . Surely he was n't really there . But he was there . Naked . Grinning obscenely . His face had been restored : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , the little quick eyes . The flesh was magicallywhole again . Impossible . Before Lisa could react , Wargle stepped between her and the door . His bare feet made a flat , slapping sound against the tile floor . Someone was pounding on the door . Wargle seemed not to hear it . Pounding and pounding and pounding .. . Why did n't they just open the door and come in ? Wargle extended his arms and made come-to-me motions with his hands . Grinning . From the moment Lisa had met him , she had n't liked Wargle . She had caught him looking at her when he thought her attention was elsewhere , and the expression in his eyes had been unsettling . " Come here , sweet stuff , " he said . She looked at the door and realized no one was pounding on it . She was only hearing the frantic thump of her own heart . Wargle licked his lips . Lisa suddenly gasped , surprising herself . She had been so totally para/lyzed by the man 's return from the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you little bitch . " She tried to scream . Could n't . Wargle touched himself obscenely . " Bet you 'd like a taste of this , huh ? " he said , grinning , his lips moist from his hungrily licking tongue . Again , she tried to scream . Again , she could n't . She could barely wrench each badly needed breath into her burning lungs . He 's not real , she told herself . If she closed her eyes for a few seconds , squeezed them tightly shut and counted to ten , he would n't be there when she looked again . " Little bitch . " He was an illusion . Maybe even part of a dream . Maybe her coming to the bathroom was really just another part of her nightmare . But she did n't test her theory . She did n't close her eyes and count to ten . She did n't dare . Wargle took a step toward her , still fondling himself . He is n't real . He 's an illusion . Another step . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , sweet stuff , let me nibble on them titties of yours . " He is n't real he 's an illusion he is n't real he 's " You 're gon na love it , sweet stuff . " She backed away from him . " Cute little body you got , sweet stuff . Real cute . " He continued to advance . The light was behind him now . His shadow fell on her . Ghosts did n't throw shadows . In spite of his laugh and in spite of his fixed grin , his voice became steadily harsher , nastier . " You stupid little slut . I 'm gon na use you real good . Real damned good . Better than any of them high school boys ever used you . You ai n't gon na be able to walk right for a week when I 'm through with you , sweet stuff . " His shadow had completely engulfed her . Her heart slamming so hard that it seemed about to tear loose , Lisa backed up farther , farther  --  but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked around for a weapon , something she could at least throw at him . There was nothing . Each breath was harder to draw than the one before it . She was dizzy and weak . He is n't real . He 's an illusion.  |p148But  she could n't delude herself any longer ; she could n't believe in the dream any more . Wargle stopped just an arm 's length from her . He glared at her . He swayed from side to side , and he rocked back and forth on the balls of his bare feet , as if some mad-dark-private music swelled and ebbed and swelled within him . He closed his hateful eyes , swaying dreamily . A second passed . What 's he doing ? Two seconds , three , six , ten . Still , his eyes remained closed . She felt herself carried away in a whirlpool of hysteria . Could she slip past him ? While his eyes were closed ? Jesus . No . He was too close . To get away , she would have to brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God , that would snap him out of his trance or whatever this was , and he would seize her , and his hands would be cold , dead-cold . She could not bring herself to touch him . No . Then she noticed something odd happening behind his eyes . Wriggling movement . The lids themselves no longer conformed to the curvature of his eyeballs . He opened his eyes . They were gone . Beneath the lids lay only empty black sockets . She finally screamed , but the cry she brought forth was beyond human hearing . Breath passed out of her in an express-train rush , and she felt her throat working convulsively , but there was absolutely no sound that would bring help . His eyes . His empty eyes . She was certain that those hollow sockets could still see her . They sucked at her with their emptiness . His grin had not faded . " Little pussy , " he said . She screamed her silent scream . " Little pussy . Kiss me , little pussy . " Somehow , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malevolent awareness . " Kiss me . " No ! Let me die , she prayed . God , please let me die first . " I want to suck on your juicy tongue , " Wargle said urgently , bursting into a giggle . He reached for her.  |p149She  pressed hard against the unyielding wall . Wurgle touched her cheek . She flinched and tried to pull away. ills fingertips trailed lightly down her cheek . hand was icy and slick . She heard a thin , dry , eerie groan  --  " Uh-uh-uh-uh-uhhhhhhh "  --  and re-Histhat she was listening to herself . She smelled something strange , acrid . His breath ? The stale breath of a dcud man , expelled from rotting lungs ? Did the walking dead breathe ? The stench was faint but unbearable . She gagged . He lowered his face toward hers . She stared into his eaten-away eyes , into the swarming blackness beyond , and it was like peering through two peepholes into the deepest chambers of Hell . His hand tightened on her throat . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  a little kiss . " She heaved out another scream . This time the scream was n't silent . This time she pealed forth a sound that seemed loud enough to shatter the restroom mirrors and to crack the ceramic tile . As Wargle 's dead , eyeless face slowly , slowly descended toward her , as she heard her scream echoing off the walls , the whirlpool of hysteria in which she 'd been spinning became , now , a whirlpool of darkness , and she was drawn down into oblivion. 20BodysnatchersIn the lobby of the Hilltop Inn , on a rust-colored sofa , against that wall which was farthest from the restrooms , Jennifer Paige sat beside her sister , holding the girl . Bryce squatted in front of the sofa , holding Lisa 's hand , which he could n't seem to make warm again no matter how firmly he pressed and rubbed it.  |p150Exce|pt  for the guards on duty , everyone had gathered behind Bryce , in a semicircle around the front of the sofa . Lisa looked terrible . Her eyes were sunken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tile floor in the ladies ' room , where they had found her unconscious . " Stu Wargle is dead , " Bryce assured her yet again . " He wanted me t-t-to . . . kiss him , " the girl repeated , clinging reso lutely to her bizarre story . " There was no one in the restroom but you , " Bryce said . " Just you , Lisa . " " He was there , " the girl insisted . " We came running as soon as you screamed . We found you alone  --  " " He was there . " "  --  on the floor , in the corner , out cold . " " He was there . " " His body is in the utility room , " Bryce said , gently squeezing her hand . " We put it there earlier . You remember , do n't you ? " " Is it still there ? " the girl asked . " Maybe you 'd better look . " Bryce met Jenny 's eyes . She nodded . Remembering that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting go of the girl 's hand . He turned toward the utility room . " Tal ? " " Yeah ? " " Come with me . " Tal drew his revolver . Pulling his own sidearm from his holster , Bryce said , " The rest of you stay back . " With Tal at his side , Bryce crossed the lobby to the utility room door and paused in front of it . " I do n't think she 's the kind of kid who makes up wild stories , " Tal said . " I know she 's not . " Bryce thought about how Paul Henderson 's corpse had vanished from the substation . Damn it , though , that had been very different from this . Paul 's body had been accessible , unguarded . But no one could have gotten to Wargle 's corpse  --  and it could n't have gotten up and walked away of its own accord  --  without being seen by one of the three deputies posted in the lobby . Yet no one and nothing had been seen . Bryce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the right of it . They listened for several seconds . The inn was silent . There was no sound from within the utility room . Keeping his body out of the doorway , Bryce leaned forward and reachedp151across the door , took hold of the knob , turned it slowly and silently until it bid gone as far as it would go . He hesitated . He glanced over at Tal , who bdicated his own readiness . Bryce took a deep breath , threw the door inward , and jumped back , out of the way . Nothing rushed from the unlighted room . I'al inched to the edge of the jamb , reached around with one arm , tumbled for the light switch , and found it . Bryce was crouched down , waiting . The instant the light came on , he launched himself through the doorway , his revolver poked out in front of him . Stark fluorescent light spilled down from the twin ceiling panels and glinted off the edges of the metal sink and off the bottles and cans of cleaning materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , lay in a pile on the floor , beside the table . Wargle 's corpse was missing . Deke Coover had been the guard stationed at the front doors of the inn . He was n't much help to Bryce . He had spent a lot of time looking out at Skyline Road , with his back to the lobby . Someone could have carted Wargle 's body away without Coover being the wiser . " You told me to watch the front approach , Sheriff , " Deke said . " As long as he did n't accompany himself with a song , Wargle could 've come out of there all by his lonesome , doing an old soft-shoe routine and waving a flag in each hand , and he might n't have attracted my notice . " The two men stationed by the elevators , near the utility room , were Kelly MacHeath and Donny Jessup . They were two of Bryce 's younger men , in their mid-twenties , but they were both able , trustworthy , and reasonably experienced . MacHeath , a blond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook his head and said , " Nobody went in or out of the utility room all night . " " Nobody , " Jessup agreed . He was a wiry , curly-haired man with eyes the color of tea . " We would 've seen them . " " The door 's right there , " MacHeath observed . " And we were here all night . " " You know us , Sheriff , " MacHeath said . " You know we are n't slackers , " Jessup said . " When we 're supposed to be on duty  --  "  | "  --  we are on duty , " Jessup finished . " Damn it , " Bryce said , " Wargle 's body is gone . It did n't just climb off that table and walk through a wall ! " " It did n't just climb off that table and walk through that door , either , " MacHeath insisted . " Sir , " Jessup said , " Wargle was dead . I did n't see the body myself , but from what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you put them . " " Not necessarily , " Bryce said . " Not in this town . Not tonight . " * * *In the utility room with Tal , Bryce said , " There 's just not another way out of here but the door . " They walked slowly around the room , studying it . The leaky faucet drooled out a drop of water that struck the pan of the metal sink with a soft ping . " The heating vent , " Tal said , pointing to a grille in one wall , directly under the ceiling . " What about that ? " " Are you serious ? " " Better have a look . " " It 's not big enough for a man to pass through . " " Remember the burglary at Krybinsky 's Jewelry Store ? " " How could I forget ? It 's still unsolved , as Alex Krybinsky so pointedly reminds me every time we meet . " " That guy entered Krybinsky 's basement through an unlocked window almost as small as that grille . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglaries , that a man of ordinary build required a surprisingly small opening to gain entrance to a building . Any hole large enough to accept a man 's head was also large enough to provide an entrance for his entire body . The shoulders were wider than the head , of course , but they could be collapsed forward or otherwise contorted enough to be squeezed through ; likewise , the breadth of the hips was nearly always sufficiently alterable to follow where the shoulders had gone . But Stu Wargle had n't been a man of ordinary build . " Stu 's belly would 've stuck in there like a cork in a bottle , " Bryce said . Nevertheless , he pulled up a stepstool that had been standing in one corner , climbed onto it , and took a closer look at the vent . " The grille 's not held in place by screws , " he told Tal . " It 's a spring-clip model , so it could conceivably have been snapped into place from inside the duct , once Wargle went through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the grille off the wall . Tal handed him a flashlight.  |p153Bryce  directed the beam into the dark heating duct and frowned . The narrow , metal passageway ran only a short distance before taking a ninetydegreeupward turn . Switching off the flashlight and passing it down to Tal , Bryce said , " Impossible . To get through there , Wargle would have to 've been no bigger than Sammy Davis , Jr. , and as flexible as the rubber man in a carnival sideshow . " Frank Autry approached Bryce Hammond at the central operations desk in the middle of the lobby , where the sheriff was seated , reading over the messages that had come in during the night . " Sir , there 's something you ought to know about Wargle . " Bryce looked up . " What 's that ? " " Well . . . I do n't like to have to speak ill of the dead ... " " None of us cared much for him , " Bryce said flatly . " Any attempt to honor his memory would be hypocritical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spill it , Frank . " Frank smiled . " You 'd have done real well for yourself in the army . " He sat on the edge of the desk . " Last night , when Wargle and I were dismantlingthe radio over at the substation , he made several disgusting remarks about Dr. Paige and Lisa . " " Sex stuff ? " " Yeah . " Frank recounted the conversation that he 'd had with Wargle . " Christ , " Bryce said , shaking his head . Frank said , " The thing about the girl was what bothered me most . Wargle was half serious when he talked about maybe making a move on her if the opportunity arose . I do n't think he 'd have gone as far as rape , but he was capable of making a very heavy pass and using his authority , his badge , to coerce her . I do n't think that kid could be coerced ; she 's too spunky . But I think Wargle might 've tried it . " The sheriff tapped a pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Lisa could n't have known , " Frank said . " She could n't have overheard any of your conversation ? " " Not a word . " " She might have suspected what kind of man Wargle was from the way he looked at her . " " But she could n't have known , " Frank said . " Do you see what I 'm driving at ? " " Yes . "  | " Most kids , " Frank said , " if they were going to make up a tall tale , they would be satisfied just to say they 'd been chased by a dead man . They would n't ordinarily embellish it by saying the dead man wanted to molest them . " Bryce tended to agree . " Kids ' minds are n't that baroque . Their lies are usually simple , not elaborate . " " Exactly , " Frank said . " The fact that she said Wargle was naked and wanted to molest her . . . well . . . to me , that seems to add credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that someone sneaked into the utility room and stole Wargle 's body . And we 'd like to believe they put the body in the ladies ' room , that Lisa saw it , that she panicked , and that she imagined all the rest . And we 'd like to believe that after she fainted , someone got the corpse out of there by some incredibly clever means . But that explanation is full of holes . What happened was a lot stranger than that . " Bryce dropped his pencil and leaned back in his chair . " Shit . You believe in ghosts , Frank ? The living dead ? " " No . There 's a real explanation for this , " Frank said . " Not a bunch of superstitious mumbo-jumbo . A real explanation . " " I agree , " Bryce said . " But Wargle 's face was ... " " I know . I saw it . " " How could his face have been put back together ? " " I do n't know . " " And Lisa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Bryce sighed . " You ever worked Rubik 's Cube ? " Frank blinked . " No . I never did . " " Well , I did , " the sheriff said . " The damned thing almost drove me crazy , but I stuck with it , and eventually I solved it . Everybody thinks that 's a hard puzzle , but compared to this case , Rubik 's Cube is a kindergartengame . " " There 's another a difference , " Frank said . " What 's that ? " " If you fail to solve Rubik 's Cube , the punishment is n't death . " In Santa Mira , in his cell in the county jail , Fletcher Kale , slayer of wife and son , woke before dawn . He lay motionless on the thin foam mattress and stared at the window , which presented a rectangular slab of the predawnsky for his inspection . He would not spend his life in prison . Would not . He had a magnificent destiny . That was the thing no one understood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to see what he would become . He was destined to have it all : money beyond counting , power beyond imagining , fame , respect . Kale knew he was different from the ruck of mankind , and it was this knowledge that kept him going in the face of all adversity . The seeds of greatness within him were already sprouting . In time , he would make them all see how wrong they had been about him . Perception , he thought as he stared up at the barred window , perception is my greatest gift . I 'm extraordinarily perceptive . He saw that , without exception , human beings were driven by selfinterest . Nothing wrong with that . It was the nature of the species . That was how humankind was meant to be . But most people could not bear to face the truth . They dreamed up so-called inspiring concepts like love , friendship , honor , truthfulness , faith , trust , and individual dignity . They claimed to believe in all those things and more ; however , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't admit it . And so , they stupidly hobbled themselves with a smarmy , self-congratulatory code of conduct , with noble but hollow sentiments , thus frustrating their true desires , doomingthemselves to failure and unhappiness . Fools . God , he despised them . From his unique perspective , Kale saw that mankind was , in reality , the most ruthless , dangerous , unforgiving species on earth . And he reveled in that knowledge . He was proud to be a member of such a race . I 'm ahead of my own time , Kale thought as he sat up on the edge of his bunk and put his bare feet on the cold floor of his cell . I am the next step of evolution . I 've evolved beyond the need to believe in morality . That 's why they look at me with such loathing . Not because I killed Joanna and Danny . They hate me because I 'm better than they are , more completely in touch with my true human nature . He 'd had no choice but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , after all . She had been prepared to humiliate him professionally , ruin him financially , and wreck his entire future . He 'd had to kill her . She was in his way . It was too bad about Danny . Kale sort of regretted that part . Not always . Just now and then . Too bad . Necessary , but too bad . Anyway , Danny had always been a regular mama 's boy . In fact , he was actually downright distant toward his father . That was Joanna 's handiwork . She had probably been brainwashing the kid , turning him against his old man . In the end , Danny really had n't been Kale 's son at all . He 'd become a stranger . Kale got down on the floor of his cell and began to do pushups . One-two , one-two , one-two.  |p156He  intended to keep himself in shape for that moment when an opportunity for escape presented itself . He knew exactly where he would go when he escaped . Not west , not out of the county , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect him to do . One-two , one-two . He knew of a perfect hideout . It was right here in the county . They would n't be looking for him under their noses . When they could n't find him in a day or so , they 'd decide he had already split , and they 'd stop actively looking in this neighborhood . When several more weeks passed , when they were n't thinking about him any longer , then he would leave the hideout , double back through town , and head west . One-two . But first , he would go up into the mountains . That 's where the hideout was . The mountains offered him the best chance of eluding the cops once he 'd escaped . He had a hunch about it . The mountains . Yeah . He felt drawn to the mountains . Dawn came to the mountains , spreading like a bright stain across the sky , soaking into the darkness and discoloring it . The forest above Snowfield was quiet . Very quiet . In the underbrush , the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humus rose up from the spongy forest floor . The air was chilly , as if the last exhalation of the night still lay upon the land . The fox stood motionless on a limestone formation that thrust up from an open slope , just below the treeline . The wind gently ruffled his gray fur . His breath made a small phosphoric plume in the crisp air . The fox was not a night hunter , yet he had been on the prowl since an hour before dawn . He had not eaten in almost two days . He had been unable to find game . The woods had been unnaturally silent and devoid of the scent of prey . In all his seasons as a hunter , the fox had never encountered such barren quietude as this . The most bitter days of midwinter were filled with more promise than this . Even in the wind-whipped snows of January , there was always the blood scent , the game scent . Not now . Now there was nothing . Death seemed to have claimed all the creatures in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox . Yet there was not even the scent of death , not even the ripe stench of a carcass moldering in the underbrush.  |p157But  at last , as he had scampered across the low limestone formation , king careful not to set foot in one of the crevices or flute holes that dropped down into the caves beneath , the fox had seen something move on the slope ahead of him , something that had not merely been stirred by the wind . He had frozen on the low rocks , staring uphill at the shadowy perim-*tcr of this new arm of the forest . A squirrel . Two squirrels . No , there were even more of them than that  --  five , ten , twenty . They were lined up side by side in the dimness along the ' recline . At first there had been no game whatsoever . Now there was an equally strange abundance of it . The fox sniffed . Although the squirrels were only five or six yards away , he could not get their scent . The squirrels were looking directly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox cocked his head , suspicion tempering his hunger . The squirrels moved to their left , all at once , in a tight little group , and then came out of the shadows of the trees , away from the protection of the forest , onto open ground , straight toward the fox . They roiled over and under and around one another , a frantic confusion of brown pelts , a blur of motion in the brown grass . When they came to an abrupt halt , all at the same instant , they were only three or four yards from the fox . And they were no longer squirrels . The fox twitched and made a hissing sound . The twenty small squirrels were now four large raccoons . The fox growled softly . Ignoring him , one of the raccoons stood on its hind feet and began washing its paws . The fur along the fox 's back bristled . He sniffed the air . No scent . He put his head low and watched the raccoons closely . His sleek muscles grew even more tense than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because he intended to flee . Something was very wrong . All four raccoons were sitting up now , forepaws tucked against their chests , tender bellies exposed . They were watching the fox . The raccoon was not usually prey for the fox . It was too aggressive , too sharp of tooth , too quick with its claws . But though it was safe from foxes ,  |p158the  raccoon never enjoyed confrontation ; it never flaunted itself as these four were doing . The fox licked the cold air with his tongue . He sniffed again and finally did pick up a scent . His ears snapped back flat against his skull , and he snarled . It was n't the scent of raccoons . It was n't the scent of any denizen of the forest that he had ever encountered before . It was an unfamiliar , sharp , unpleasant odor . Faint . But repellent . This vile odor was n't coming from any of the four raccoons that posed in front of the fox . He was n't quite able to make out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox whipped around on the limestone , turning away from the raccoons , although he was reluctant to put his back to them . His paws scraped and his claws clicked on the hard surface as he launched himself down the slope , across the flat weather-worn rock , his tail streaming out behind him . He leaped over a foot-wide crevice in the stone -- and in midleap he was snatched from the air by something dark and cold and pulsing . The thing burst up out of the crevice with brutal , shocking force and speed . The agonized squeal of the fox was sharp and brief . As quickly as the fox was seized , it was drawn down into the crevice . Five feet below , at the bottom of the miniature chasm , there was a small hole that led into the caves beneath the limestone outcropping . The hole was too small to admit the fox , but the struggling creature was dragged through anyway , its bones snapping as it went . Gone . All in the blink of an eye . Half a blink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the echo of its dying cry had even pealed back from a distant hillside . The raccoons were gone . Now , a flood of field mice poured onto the smooth slabs of limestone . Scores of them . At least a hundred . They went to the edge of the crevice . They stared down into it . One by one , the mice slipped over the edge , dropped to the bottom , and then went through the small natural opening into the cavern below . Soon , all the mice were gone , too . Once again , the forest above Snowfield was quiet.  |p161Santa  Mira . Monday  --  1:02 A.M. " Hello ? " " Is this the Santa Mira Daily News ? " " Yeah . " " The newspaper ? " " Lady , the paper 's closed . It 's after one in the morning . " " Closed ? I did n't know a newspaper ever closed . " " This is n't the New York Times .

I do n't know exactly what , but I know people are dead . There might even be a lot of peopledead or at least in danger of dying . " " Christ , I must be tireder than I thought . I 'm getting interested in spite of myself . Tell me . " " We 've rerouted Snowfield 's phone service , pulled it off the automatic dialing system , and restricted all ingoing calls . You can only reach two numbers up there now , and both of them are being answered by the sheriff'smen . The reason they 've set it up that way is to seal the place off before the reporters find out something 's up . " " Lady , what 've you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then what 've you been smoking ?

Man , he 's involved with some biological warfare outfit . It 's supposed to be a peaceful application of his research , but you know that 's a lot of horseshit .

There 's been some kind of contamination in Snowfield . A big emergency . Everyone'stryin ' to keep it secret . " " Snowfield , California ? " " Yeah , yeah . What I figure , man , is that they were secretly runnin ' a test of some germ weapon on our own people and it got out of hand . Or maybe it was an accidental spill . Somethin ' real heavy 's goin ' down , for sure . " " What 's your name , son ? " " Ricky Bettenby . My old man 's name is Wilson Bettenby . " " Stanford , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on this , man ? " " Maybe there 's something to it . But before I start calling people at Stanford , I need to ask you a lot more questions . " " Fire away . I 'll tell you whatever I can . I want to blast this wide open , man . I want him to pay for sellin ' out . " Throughout the night , the leaks sprung one by one . At Dugway , Utah , an army officer , who should have known better , used a pay phone off thep164base to call New York and spill the story to a much-loved younger brother who was a cub reporter for the Times . In bed , after sex , an aide to the governor told his lover , a woman reporter . Those and other holes in the dam caused the flow of information to grow from a trickle to a flood . By three o'clock in the morning , the switchboard at the Santa Mira County Sheriff 's Office was overloaded . By dawn , the newspaper , television , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours of first light , the street in front of the sheriff 's offices was crowded with press cars , camera vans bearing the logos of TV stations in Sacramentoand San Francisco , reporters , and curiosity seekers of all ages . The deputies gave up trying to keep people from congregating in the middle of the street , for there were too many of them to be herded onto the sidewalks . They sealed off the block with sawhorses and turned it into a big open-air press compound . A couple of enterprising kids from a nearby apartment building starting selling Tang , cookies , and  --  with the aid of the longest series of extension cords anyone could remember seeing  --  hot coffee . Their refreshment stand became the rumor center , where reporters gathered to share theories and hearsay while they waited for the latest official information handouts . Other newsmen spread out through Santa Mira , seeking people who had friends or relatives living up in Snowfield , or who were in some way related to the deputies now stationed there . Out at the junction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters were camping at the police roadblock . In spite of all this hurly-burly , fully half of the press had not yet arrived . Many representatives of the Eastern media and the foreign press were still in transit . For the authorities who were trying hard to deal with the mess , the worst was yet to come . By Monday afternoon , it would be a circus . Not long after dawn , the shortwave radio and the two gasoline-powered electric generators arrived at the roadblock that marked the perimeter of the quarantine zone . The two small vans which bore them were driven by California Highway Patrolmen . They were permitted to pass through thep165blockade , to a point midway along the four-mile Snowfield Road , where they were parked and abandoned . When the CHiP officers returned to the roadblock , county deputies radioeda situation report to headquarters in Santa Mira . In turn , headquartersput through a go-ahead call to Bryce Hammond at the Hilltop Inn . Tal Whitman , Frank Autry , and two other men took a squad car to the midpoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any possible disease vectors was thus maintained . The shortwave was set up in one corner of the Hilltop lobby . A message sent to headquarters in Santa Mira was received and answered . Now , if something happened to the telephones , they would n't be entirely isolated . Within an hour , one of the generators had been wired into the circuitry of the streetlamps on the west side of the Skyline Road . The other was spliced into the hotel 's electrical system . Tonight , if the main power supply was mysteriously cut off , the generators would kick in automatically . Darknesswould last only one or two seconds . Bryce was confident that not even their unknown enemy could snatch away a victim that fast . Jenny Paige began the morning with an unsatisfactory sponge bath , followed by a completely satisfactory breakfast of eggs , sliced ham , toast , and coffee . Then , accompanied by three heavily armed men , she went up the street to her house , where she got some fresh clothes for herself and for Lisa . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stethoscope , a sphygmomanometer , tongue depressors , cotton pads , gauze , splints , bandages , tourniquets , antiseptics , disposable hypodermic syringes , painkillers , antibiotics , and other instruments and supplies that she would need in order to establish an emergency infirmary in one corner of the Hilltop Inn 's lobby . The house was quiet . The deputies kept looking around nervously , entering each new room as if they suspected a guillotine was rigged above the door . As Jenny was finishing packing up supplies in her office , the telephone rang . They all stared at it . They knew only two phones in town were working , and both were at the Hilltop Inn . The phone rang again . Jenny lifted the receiver . She did n't say hello . Silence . She waited . After a second , she heard the distant cries of sea gulls . The buzzing ofp166bees . The mewling of a kitten . A weeping child . Another child : laughing . A panting dog . The **27;10663;TOOLONG sound of a rattlesnake . Bryce had heard similar things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the moth had come tapping at the windows . He had said that the sounds had been perfectly ordinary , familiar animal noises . They had , nonetheless , unsettled him . He had n't been able to explain why . Now Jenny knew exactly what he meant . Birds singing . Frogs croaking . A cat purring . The purr became a hiss . The hiss became a cat-shriek of anger . The shriek became a brief but terrible squeal of pain . Then a voice : " I 'm gon na shove my big prick into your succulent little sister . " Jenny recognized the voice . Wargle . The dead man . " You hear me , Doc ? " She said nothing . " And I do n't give a rat 's ass which end of her I stick it in . " He giggled . She slammed the phone down . The deputies looked at her expectantly . " Uh . . . no one on the line , " she said , deciding not to tell them what she had heard . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went to Tayton 's Pharmacy on Vail Lane , where she stocked up on more drugs : additional painkillers , a wide spectrumof antibiotics , coagulants , anticoagulants , and anything else she might conceivably need . As they were finishing in the pharmacy , the phone rang . Jenny was closest to it . She did n't want to answer , but she could n't resist . And it was there again . Jenny waited a moment , then said , " Hello ? " Wargle said , " I 'm gon na use your little sister so hard she wo n't be able to walk for a week . " Jenny hung up . " Dead line , " she told the deputies . She did n't think they believed her . They stared at her trembling hands . Bryce sat at the central operations desk , talking by telephone to headquarters in Santa Mira . The APB on Timothy Flyte had turned up nothing whatsoever . Flyte was n't wanted by any police agency in the United States or Canada . Thep167FBI had never heard of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a mystery . The San Francisco police had been able to supply background on the missing Harold Ordnay and wife , in whose room Timothy Flyte 's name had been found . The Ordnays owned two bookstores in San Francisco . One was an ordinary retail outlet . The other was an antiquarian and rare book dealership ; apparently , it was by far the more profitable of the two . The Ordnays were well known and respected in collecting circles . According to their family , Harold and Blanche had gone to Snowfield for a four-day weekend to celebrate their thirty-first anniversary . The family had never heard of Timothy Flyte . When police were granted permission to look through the Ordnays ' personal address book , they found no listing for anyone named Flyte . The police had not yet been able to locate any of the bookstores ' employees ; however , they expected to do so as soon as both shops opened at ten o'clock this morning . It was hoped that Flyte was a business acquaintanceof the Ordnays ' and would be familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the morning desk man in Santa Mira . " How 're things there ? " " Pandemonium . " " It 'll get worse . " As Bryce was putting down the receiver , Jenny Paige returned from her safari in search of drugs and medical equipment . " Where 's Lisa ? " " With the kitchen detail , " Bryce said . " She 's all right ? " " Sure . There are three big , strong , well-armed men with her . Remember ? Is something wrong ? " " Tell you later . " Bryce assigned Jenny 's three armed guards to new duties , then helped her establish an infirmary in one corner of the lobby . " This is probably wasted effort , " she said.  --  WhY ? " " So far no one 's been injured . Just killed . " " Well , that could change . " " I think it only strikes when it intends to kill . It does n't take halfway measures . " " Maybe . But with all these men toting guns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half surprised if someone accidentally winged someone else or even shot himself in the foot . " Arranging bottles in a desk drawer , Jenny said , " The telephone rang at my place and again over at the pharmacy . It was Wargle . " She told him about both calls.  | " You 're sure it was really him ? " " I remember his voice clearly . An unpleasant voice . " " But , Jenny , he was  --  " " I know , I know . His face was eaten away , and his brain was gone , and all the blood was sucked out of him . I know . And it 's driving me crazy trying to figure it out . " " Someone doing an impersonation ? " " If it was , then there 's someone out there who makes Rich Little look like an amateur . " " Did he sound as if he  --  " Bryce broke off in midsentence , and both he and Jenny turned as Lisa ran through the archway . The girl motioned to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . " Before Bryce could stop her , she ran back the way she had come . Several men started after her , drawing their guns as they went , and Bryce ordered them to halt . " Stay here . Stay on the job . " Jenny had already sprinted after the girl . Bryce hurried into the dining room , caught up with Jenny , moved ahead of her , drew his revolver , and followed Lisa through the swinging doors into the hotel kitchen . The three men assigned to this shift of kitchen duty  --  Gordy Brogan , Henry Wong , and Max Dunbar  --  had put down their can openers and cooking utensils in favor of their service revolvers , but they did n't know what to aim at . They glanced up at Bryce , looking disconcerted and baffled . " Here we go ' round the mulberry bush , the mulberry bush , the mulberry bush . " The air was filled with a child 's singing . A little boy . His voice was clear and fragile and sweet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the moooorrrrninnnggg ! " " The sink , " Lisa said , pointing . Puzzled , Bryce went to the nearest of three double sinks . Jenny came close behind him . The song had changed . The voice was the same :  | " This old man , he plays one ; he plays nick-nack on my drum . With a nick-nack , paddywack , give a dog a bone  --  " The child 's voice was coming out of the drain in the sink , as if he were trapped far down in the pipes. "  --  this old man goes rolling home . " For metronomic seconds , Bryce listened with spellbound intensity . He was speechless . He glanced at Jenny . She gave him the same astonished stare that he had seen on his men 's faces when he had first pushed through the swinging doors . " It just started all of a sudden , " Lisa said , raising her voice above the singing . " When ? " Bryce asked . " A couple of minutes ago , " Gordy Brogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Max Dunbar said . He was a burly , hairy , rough-looking man with warm , shy brown eyes . " When the singing started up . . . Jesus , I must 've jumped two feet ! " The song changed again . The sweetness was replaced by a cloying , almostmocking piety : " Jesus loves me , this I know , for the Bible tells me so . " " I do n't like this , " Henry Wong said . " How can it be ? " " Little ones to Him are drawn . They are weak , but He is strong . " Nothing about the singing was overtly threatening ; yet , like the noises Bryce and Jenny had heard on the telephone , the child 's tender voice , issuing from such an unlikely source , was unnerving . Creepy . " Yes , Jesus loves me . Yes , Jesus loves me . Yes , Jesus  --  "  |p170The  singing abruptly ceased . " Thank God ! " Max Dunbar said with a shudder of relief , as if the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-key . " That voice was drilling right through to the roots of my teeth ! " After several seconds had passed in silence , Bryce began to lean toward the drain , to peer into it -- and Jenny said maybe he shouldn't -- and something exploded out of that dark , round hole . Everyone cried out , and Lisa screamed , and Bryce staggered back in fear and surprise , cursing himself for not being more careful , jerking his revolver up , bringing the muzzle to bear on the thing that came out of the drain . But it was only water . A long , high-pressure stream of exceptionally filthy , greasy water shot almost to the ceiling and rained down over everything . It was a short burst , only a second or two , spraying in every direction . Some of the foul droplets struck Bryce 's face . Dark blotches appeared on the front of his shirt . The stuff stank . It was exactly what you would expect to gush out of a backed-up drain : dirty brown water , threads of gummy sludge , bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the garbage disposal . Gordy got a roll of paper towels , and they all scrubbed at their faces and blotted at the stains on their clothes . They were still wiping at themselves , still waiting to see if the singing would begin again , when Tal Whitman pushed open one of the swinging doors . " Bryce , we just got a call . General Copperfield and his team reached the roadblock and were passed through a couple of minutes ago . " Snowfield looked freshly scrubbed and tranquil in the crystalline light of morning . A breeze stirred the trees . The sky was cloudless . Coming out of the inn , with Bryce and Frank and Doc Paige and a few of the others behind him , Tal glanced up at the sun , the sight of which unlocked a memory of his childhood in Harlem . He used to buy pennyp171candy at Boaz 's Newsstand , which was at the opposite end of the block from his Aunt Becky 's apartment . He favored the lemondrops . They were the prettiest shade of yellow he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the sun was precisely that shade of yellow , hanging up there like an enormous lemondrop . It brought back the sights and sounds and smells of Boaz 's with surprising force . Lisa moved up beside Tal , and they all stopped on the sidewalk , facing downhill , waiting for the arrival of the CBW Defense Unit . Nothing moved at the bottom of the hill . The mountainside was silent . Evidently , Copperfield 's team was some distance away . Waiting in the lemon sunshine , Tal wondered if Boaz 's Newsstand was still doing business at its old location . Most likely , it was now just another empty store , filthy and vandalized . Or maybe it was selling magazines , tobacco , and candy only as a front for pushing dope . As he grew older , he became ever more acutely aware of a tendency toward degeneration in all things . Nice neighborhoods somehow became shabby neighborhoods ; shabby neighborhoods became seedy neighborhoods ; seedy neighborhoods became slums . Order giving way to chaos . You saw it everywhere these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater abuse of drugs . Spiraling rates of assault , rape , burglary . What saved Tal from being a pessimist about mankind 's future was his fervent conviction that good people  --  people like Bryce , Frank , and Doc Paige ; people like his Aunt Becky  --  could stem the tide of devolution and maybe even turn it back now and then . But his faith in the power of good people and responsible actions was facing a severe test here in Snowfield . This evil seemed unbeatable . " Listen ! " Gordy Brogan said . " I hear engines . " Tal looked at Bryce . " I thought they were n't expected until around noon . They 're three hours early . " " Noon was the latest possible arrival time , " Bryce said . " Copperfield wanted to make it sooner if he could . Judging from the conversation I had with him , he 's a tough taskmaster , the kind of guy who usually gets exactly what he wants out of his people . " " Just like you , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drooping eyelids . " Me ? Tough ? Why , I 'm a pussycat . " Tal grinned . " So 's a panther . " " Here they come ! " At the bottom of Skyline Road , a large vehicle hove into view , and the sound of its laboring engine grew louder.  |p172There  were three large vehicles in the CBW Civilian Defense Unit . Jenny watched them as they crawled slowly up the long , sloped street toward the Hilltop Inn . Leading the procession was a gleaming , white motor home , a lumbering thirty-six-foot behemoth that had been somewhat modified . It had no doors or windows along its flank . The only entrance evidently was at the back . The curved , wraparound windshield of the cab was tinted very dark , so you could n't see inside , and it appeared to be made of much thicker glass than that used in ordinary motor homes . There was no identification on the vehicle , no project name , no indication that it was army property . The license plate was standard California issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind the first motor home came a second . Bringing up the rear was an unmarked truck pulling a thirty-foot , plain gray trailer . Even the truck 's windows were tinted , armor-thick glass . Not certain that the driver of the lead vehicle had seen their group standing in front of the Hilltop , Bryce stepped into the street and waved his arms over his head . The payloads in the motor homes and in the truck were obviously quite heavy . Their engines strained hard , and they ground their way up the street , moving slower than ten miles an hour , then slower than five , inching , groaning , grinding . When at last they reached the Hilltop , they kept on going , made a right-hand turn at the corner , and swung into the cross street that flanked the inn . Jenny , Bryce , and the others went around to the side of the inn as the motorcade pulled up to the curb and parked . All of the east-west streets in Snowfield ran across the broad face of the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much easier to park and secure the three vehicles there than on the steeply sloped Skyline Road . Jenny stood on the sidewalk , watching the rear door of the first motor home , waiting for someone to come out . The three overheated engines were switched off , one after the other , and silence fell in with a weight of its own . Jenny 's spirits were higher than they had been since she 'd driven into Snowfield last night . The specialists had arrived . Like most Americans , she had enormous faith in specialists , in technology , and in science . In fact , she probably had more faith than most , for she was a specialist herself , a woman of science . Soon , they would understand what had killed Hilda Beck and the Liebermanns and all the others . The specialists had arrived . The cavalry had ridden in at last . The back door of the truck opened first , and men jumped down . They were dressed for operations in a biologically contaminated atmosphere.  |p173They  were wearing the white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with large helmets that had oversize , plexiglass faceplates . Each man carried his own air supply tank on his back , as well as a briefcase-size waste purification and reclamation system . Curiously , Jenny did not , at first , think of the men as resembling astronauts . They seemed like followers of some strange religion , resplendent in their priestly raiments . Half a dozen agile men had scrambled out of the truck . More were still coming when Jenny realized that they were heavily armed . They spread out around both sides of their caravan and took up positions between their transport and the people on the sidewalk , facing away from the vehicles . These men were n't scientists . They were support troops . Their names were stenciled on their helmets , just above their faceplates : SGT . HARKER , PVT . FODOR , PVT . PASCALLI , LT . UNDERHILL . They brought up their guns and aimed outward , securing a perimeter in a determined fashion that brooked no interference . To her shock and confusion , Jenny found herself staring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the troops , Bryce said , " What the hell is the meaning of this ? " Sergeant Harker , nearest to Bryce , swung his gun toward the sky and fired a short burst of warning shots . Bryce stopped abruptly . Tal and Frank reached automatically for their own sidearms . " No ! " Bryce shouted . " No shooting , for Christ 's sake ! We 're on the same side . " One of the soldiers spoke . Lieutenant Underhill . His voice issued tinnily from a small radio amplifier in a six-inch-square box on his chest . " Please stay back from the vehicles . Our first duty is to guard the integrity of the labs , and we will do so at all costs . " " Damn it , " Bryce said , " we 're not going to cause any trouble . I 'm the one who called for you in the first place . " " Stay back , " Underhill insisted . The rear door of the first motor home finally opened . The four individualswho came out were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . They moved unhurriedly . They were unarmed . One of them was a woman ; Jenny caught a glimpse of a strikingly lovely , female , oriental face . The names on their helmets were n't preceded by designation of rank : BETTENBY , VALDEZ , NIVEN , YAMAGUCHI . These were the civilian physiciansand scientists who , in an extreme chemical-biological warfare emergency , walked away from their private lives in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , and other Western cities , putting themselves at Copperfield 's dis/posal . According to Bryce , there was one such team in the West , one in the East , and one in the Southern-Gulf states . Six men came out of the second motor home . GOLDSTEIN , ROBERTS , COPPERFIELD , HOUK . The last two were in unmarked suits , no names above their faceplates . They moved up the line , staying behind the armed soldiers , and joined up with Bettenby , Valdez , Niven , and Yamaguchi . Those ten conducted a brief conversation among themselves , by way of intersuit radio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the squawk boxes on their chests did not transmit a word , which meant they had the capability to conduct both public and strictly private discussions . For the time being , they were opting for privacy . But why ? Jenny wondered . They do n't have anything to hide from us . Do they ? General Copperfield , the tallest of the twenty , turned away from the group at the rear of the first motor home , stepped onto the sidewalk , and approached Bryce . Before Copperfield took the initiative , Bryce stepped up to him . " General , I demand to know why we 're being held at gunpoint . " " Sorry , " Copperfield said . He turned to the stone-faced troopers and said , " Okay , men . It 's a no-sweat situation . Parade rest . " Because of the air tanks they were carrying , the soldiers could n't comfortablyassume a classic parade rest position . But , moving with the fluid harmony of a precision drill team , they immediately slung their submachine guns from their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms straight down at their sides , and stood motionless , facing forward . Bryce had been correct when he 'd told Tal that Copperfield sounded like a tough taskmaster . It was obvious to Jenny that there was no discipline problem in the general 's unit . Turning to Bryce again , smiling through his faceplate , Copperfield said , " That better ? " " Better , " Bryce said . " But I still want an explanation . " " Just SOP , " Copperfield said . " Standard Operating Procedure . It 's part of the normal drill . We do n't have anything against you or your people , Sheriff . You are Sheriff Hammond , are n't you ? I remember you from the conference in Chicago last year . " " Yes , sir , I 'm Hammond . But you still have n't given me a suitable explanation . SOP just is n't good enough . " " No need to raise your voice , Sheriff . " With one gloved hand , Copperfieldtapped the squawk box on his chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also equipped with an extremely sensitive microphone . You see , goingp175into a place where there might be serious biological or chemical contamination , we 've got to consider the possibility that we might be overwhelmedby a lot of sick and dying people . Now , we simply are n't equipped to administer cures or even amelioratives . We 're a research team . Strictly pathology , not treatment . It 's our job to find out all we can about the nature of the contaminant , so that properly equipped medical teams can come in right behind us and deal with the survivors . But dying and desperate people might not understand that we ca n't treat them . They might attack the mobile labs out of anger and frustration . " " And fear , " Tal Whitman said . " Exactly , " the general said , missing the irony . " Our psychological stress simulations indicate that it 's a very real possibility . " " And if sick and dying people did try to disrupt your work , " Jenny said , " would you kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed off his faceplate , transformingit into a mirror , and for a moment she could not see him . Then he shifted slightly , and his face emerged into view again , but not enough of it for her to see what he really looked like . It was a face out of context , framed in the transparent portion of his helmet . He said , " Dr. Paige , I presume ? " " Yes . " " Well , Doctor , if terrorists or agents of a foreign government committed an act of biological warfare against an American community , it would be up to me and my people to isolate the microbe , identify it , and suggest measures to contain it . That is a sobering responsibility . If we allowed anyone , even the suffering victims , to deter us , the danger of the plague spreading would increase dramatically . " " So , " Jenny said , still pressing him , " if sick and dying people did try to disrupt your work , you 'd kill them . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must occasionally choose between the lesser of two evils . " Jenny looked around at Snowfield , which was as much of a graveyard in the morning sun as it had been in the gloom of night . General Copperfield was right . Anything he might have to do to protect his team would only be a little evil . The big evil was what had been done  --  what was still being done  --  to this town . She was n't quite sure why she had been so testy with him . Maybe it was because she had thought of him and his people as the cavalry , riding in to save the day . She had wanted all the problems to be solved , all the ambiguities cleared up instantly upon Copperfield 's arrival . When she 'd realized that it was n't going to work out that way , when theyp176had actually pulled guns on her , the dream had faded fast . Irrationally , she had blamed the general . That was n't like her . Her nerves must be more badly frayed than she had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Copperfield interrupted . " I do n't mean to be rude , Sheriff , but we do n't have time for introductions . Later . Right now , I want to move . I want to see all those things you told me about on the phone last night , and then I want to get an autopsy started . " He wants to skip introductions because it does n't make sense to be chummy with people who may be doomed , Jenny thought . If we develop disease symptoms in the next few hours , if it turns out to be a brain disease , and if we go berserk and try to rush the mobile labs , it 'll be easier for him to have us shot if he does n't know us very well . Stop it ! she told herself angrily . She looked at Lisa and thought : Good heavens , kid , if I 'm this frazzled , what a state you must be in . Yet you 've kept as stiff an upper lip as anyone . What a damned fine kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you around , " Bryce told Copperfield , " you ought to know about the thing we saw last night and what happened to  --  " " No , no , " Copperfield said impatiently . " I want to go through it step by step . Just the way you found things . There 'll be plenty of time to tell me what happened last night . Let 's get moving . " " But , you see , it 's beginning to look as if it ca n't possibly be a disease that 's wiped out this town , " Bryce protested . The general said , " My people have come here to investigate possible CBW connections . We 'll do that first . Then we can consider other possibilities . SOP , Sheriff . " Bryce sent most of his men back into the Hilltop Inn , keeping only Tal and Frank with him . Jenny took Lisa 's hand , and they , too , headed back to the inn . Copperfield called out to her . " Doctor ! Wait a moment . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene . If the condition of the corpses has changed , you 're the one most likely to notice . " Jenny looked at Lisa . " Want to come along ? " " Back to the bakery ? No , thanks . " The girl shuddered . Thinking of the eerily sweet , childlike voice that had come from the sink drain , Jenny said , " Do n't go in the kitchen . And if you have to go to the bathroom , ask someone to go along with you . " " Jenny , they 're all guys ! " " I do n't care . Ask Gordy . He can stand outside the stall with his back turned . "  | " Jeez , that 'd be embarrassing . " " You want to go into that bathroom by yourself again ? " The color drained out of the girl 's face . " No way . " " Good . Keep close to the others . And I mean close . Not just in the same room . Stay in the same part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about the two telephone calls from Wargle this morning . She thought of the gross threats he 'd made . Although they had been the threats of a dead man and should have been meaningless , Jenny was frightened . " You be careful , too , " Lisa said . She kissed the girl on the cheek . " Now hurry and catch up with Gordy before he turns the corner . " Lisa ran , calling ahead : " Gordy ! Wait up ! " The tall young deputy stopped at the corner and looked back . Watching Lisa sprint along the cobblestone sidewalk , Jenny felt her heart tightening . She thought : What if , when I come back , she 's gone ? What if I never see her alive again ? Liebermann 's Bakery . Bryce , Tal , Frank , and Jenny entered the kitchen . General Copperfield and the nine scientists on his team followed closely , and four soldiers , toting submachine guns , brought up the rear . The kitchen was crowded . Bryce felt uncomfortable . What if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had to get out in a hurry ? The two heads were exactly where they had been last night : in the ovens , peering through the glass . On the worktable the severed hands still clutched the rolling pin . Niven , one of the general 's people , took several photographs of the kitchen from various angles , then about a dozen close-ups of the heads and hands.  |p178The  others kept edging around the room to get out of Niven 's way . The photographic record had to be completed before the forensic work could begin , which was not unlike the routine policemen followed at the scene of a crime . As the spacesuited scientists moved , their rubberized clothing squeaked . Their heavy boots scraped noisily on the tile floor . " You still think it looks like a simple incident of CBW ? " Bryce asked Copperfield . " Could be . " " Really ? " Copperfield said , " Phil , you 're the resident nerve gas specialist . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? " The question was answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's much too early to tell anything for certain , but it seems as if we could be dealing with a neuroleptic toxin . And there are some things about this  --  most notably , the extreme psychopathic violence  --  that lead me to wonder if we 've got a case of T-139 . " " Definitely a possibility , " Copperfield said . " Just what I thought when we walked in . " Niven continued to snap photographs , and Bryce said , " So what 's this T-139 ? " " One of the primary nerve gases in the Russian arsenal , " the general said . " The full moniker is Timoshenko-139 . It 's named after Ilya Timoshenko , the scientist who developed it . " " What a lovely monument , " Tal said sarcastically . " Most nerve gases cause death within thirty seconds to five minutes after skin contact , " Houk said . " But T-139 is n't that merciful . " " Merciful ! " Frank Autry said , appalled . " T-139 is n't just a killer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison . T-139 is what military strategists call a demoralizer . " Copperfield said , " It passes through the skin and enters the bloodstream in ten seconds or less , then migrates to the brain and almost instantly causes irreparable damage to cerebral tissues . " Houk said , " For a period of about four to six hours , the victim retains full use of his limbs and a hundred percent of his normal strength . At first , it 's only his mind that suffers . " " Dementia paranoides , " Copperfield said . " Intellectual confusion , fear , rage , loss of emotional control , and a very strongly held feeling that everyone is plotting against him . This is combined with a fierce compulsion to commit violent acts . In essence , Sheriff , T-139 turns people into mindless killing machines for four to six hours . They prey on one another and onp179unaffected people outside the area of the gas attack . You can see what an extremely demoralizing effect it would have on an enemy . " " Extremely , " Bryce said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , a mutant rabies that would kill some people while turning others into demented murderers . " " T-139 is n't a disease , " Houk said quickly . " It 's a nerve gas . And if I had my choice , I 'd rather this was a nerve gas attack . Once gas has dissipated , the threat is over . A biological threat is considerably harder to contain . " " If it was gas , " Copperfield said , " it 'll have dissipated long ago , but there 'll be traces of it on almost everything . Condensative residue . We 'll be able to identify it in no time at all . " They backed against a wall to make way for Niven and his camera . Jenny said , " Dr. Houk , in regards to this T-139 , you mentioned that the ambulatory stage lasts four to six hours . Then what ? " Well , " Houk said , " the second stage is the terminal stage , too . It lasts anywhere from six to twelve hours . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paralysis of the cardiac , vasomotor , and respiratory reflex centers in the brain . " " Good God , " Jenny said . Frank said , " Once more for us laymen . " Jenny said , " It means that during the second stage of the illness , over a period of six to twelve hours , T-139 gradually reduces the brain 's ability to regulate the automatic functions of the body  --  such as breathing , heartbeat , blood vessel dilation , organ function . . . The victim starts experiencingan irregular heartbeat , extreme difficulty in breathing , and the gradual collapse of every gland and organ . Twelve hours might not seem gradual to you , but it would seem like an eternity to the victim . There would be vomiting , diarrhea , uncontrollable urination , continuous and violent musclespasms . . . And if only the efferent nerves were damaged , if the rest of the nervous system remained intact , there would be excruciating , unrelentingpain . " " Six to twelve hours of hell , " Copperfield confirmed . " Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the victim simply stops breathing and suffocates . " For long seconds , as Niven clicked the last of his photographs , no one spoke . Finally , Jenny said , " I still do n't think a nerve gas could 've played any part in this , not even something like T-139 that would explain these beheadings . For one thing , none of the victims we found showed any signs of vomiting or incontinence . " " Well , " Copperfield said , " we could be dealing with a derivative ofp180T-139 that does n't produce those symptoms . Or some other gas . " " No gas can explain the moth , " Tal Whitman said . " Or what happened to Stu Wargle , " Frank said . Copperfield said , " Moth ? " " You did n't want to hear about that until you 'd seen these other things , " Bryce reminded Copperfield . " But now I think it 's time you  --  " Niven said , " Finished . " " All right , " Copperfield said . " Sheriff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence until we 've completed the rest of our tasks here , your cooperation will be much appreciated . " The others immediately set to work . Yamaguchi and Bettenby transferredthe severed heads into a pair of porcelain-lined specimen buckets with locking , airtight lids . Valdez carefully pried the hands away from the rolling pin and put them in a third specimen bucket . Houk scraped some flour off the table and into a small plastic jar , evidently because dry flour would have absorbed  --  and would still contain  --  traces of the nerve gas  --  if , in fact , there had been any nerve gas . Houk also took a sample of the pie crust dough that lay under the rolling pin . Goldstein and Roberts inspected the two ovens from which the heads had been removed , and then Goldsteinused a small , battery-powered vacuum cleaner to sweep out the first oven . When that was done , Roberts took the bag of sweepings , sealed it , and labeled it , while Goldstein used the vacuum to collect minute and even microscopic evidence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the two men who were wearing the suits that had no names on the helmets . They stood to one side , merely watching . Bryce watched the watchers , wondering who they were and what functionthey performed . As the others worked , they described what they were doing and made comments about what they found , always speaking in a jargon that Bryce could n't follow . No two of them spoke at once ; that fact  --  when coupled with Copperfield 's request for silence from those who were not team members  --  madeit seem as if they were speaking for the record . Among the items that hung from the utility belt around Copperfield 's waist there was a tape recorder wired directly into the communications system of the general 's suit . Bryce saw that the reels of tape were moving . When the scientists had gotten everything they wanted from the bakery kitchen , Copperfield said , " All right , Sheriff . Where now ? " Bryce indicated the tape recorder . " Are n't you going to switch that off until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment we were allowed past thep181roadblock , and we 'll keep recording until we 've found out what 's happened to this town . That way , if something goes wrong , if we all die before we find the solution , the new team will know every step we took . They wo n't have to start from scratch , and they might even have a detailed record of the fatal mistake that got us killed . " The second stop was the arts and crafts gallery into which Frank Autry had led the three other men last night . Again , he led the way through the showroom , into the rear office , and up the stairs to the second-floor apartment . It seemed to Frank that there was almost something comic about the scene : all these spacemen lumbering up the narrow stairs , their faces theatricallygrim behind plexiglass faceplates , the sound of their breathing amplified by the closed spaces of their helmets and projected out of the speakers on their chests at an exaggerated volume , an ominous sound . It was like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alien Astronauts or something equally corny  --  and Frank could n't help smiling . But his vague smile vanished when he entered the apartment kitchen and saw the dead man again . The corpse was where it had been last night , lying at the foot of the refrigerator , wearing only blue pajama bottoms . Still swollen , bruised , staring wide-eyed at nothing . Frank moved out of the way of Copperfield 's people and joined Bryce ' beside the counter where the toaster oven stood . As Copperfield again requested silence from the uninitiated , the scientistsstepped carefully around the sandwich fixings that were scattered across the floor . They crowded around the corpse . In a few minutes they were finished with a preliminary examination of the body . Copperfield turned to Bryce and said , " We 're going to take this one for an autopsy . " " You still think it looks as if we 're dealing with just a simple incident of CBW ? " Bryce asked , as he had asked before . " It 's entirely possible , yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tal said . " Could be allergic reactions to a nerve gas , " Houk said . " If you 'll slide up the leg of the pajamas , " Jenny said , " I believe you 'll find that the reaction extends even to unexposed skin . " " Yes , it does , " Copperfield said . " We 've already looked . " " But how could the skin react even where no nerve gas came into contact with it ? "  | " Such gases usually have a high penetration factor , " Houk said . " They 'll pass right through most clothes . In fact , about the only thing that 'll stop many of them is vinyl or rubber garments . " Just what you 're wearing , Frank thought , and just what we 're not . " There 's another body here , " Bryce told the general . " Do you want to have a look at that one , too ? " " Absolutely . " " It 's this way , sir , " Frank said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his gun drawn . Frank dreaded entering the bedroom where the dead woman lay naked in the rumpled sheets . He remembered the crude things that Stu Wargle had said about her , and he had the terrible feeling that Stu was going to be there now , coupled with the blonde , their dead bodies locked in cold and timeless passion . But only the woman was there . Sprawled on the bed . Legs still spread wide . Mouth open in an eternal scream . When Copperfield and his people had finished a preliminary examination of the corpse and were ready to go , Frank made sure they had seen the .22 automatic which she had apparently emptied at her killer . " Do you think she would have shot at just a cloud of nerve gas , General ? " " Of course not , " Copperfield said . " But perhaps she was already affectedby the gas , already brain damaged . She could have been shooting at hallucinations , at phantoms . " " Phantoms , " Frank said . " Yes , sir , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Because , see , she fired all ten shots in the clip , yet we found only two expended slugs  --  one in that highboy over there , one in the wall where you see the hole . That means she mostly hit whatever she was shooting at . " " I knew these people , " Doc Paige said , stepping forward . " Gary and Sandy Wechlas . She was something of a markswoman . Always target shooting . She won several competitions at the county fair last year . " " So she had the skill to make eight hits out of ten , " Frank said . " And even eight hits did n't stop the thing she was trying to stop . Eight hits did n't even make it bleed . Of course , phantoms do n't bleed . But , sir , would a phantom be able to walk out of here and take those eight slugs with it ? " Copperfield stared at him , frowning . All the scientists were frowning , too . The soldiers were n't only frowning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the two bodies  --  especially thewoman 's nightmarish expression  --  had had an effect on the general and hispeople . The fear in everyone 's eyes was sharper now . Although they didn'twant to admit it , they had encountered some thir ; beyond their experi/once . They were still clinging to explanations that made sense to them  --  nerve gas , virus , poison  --  but they were beginning to have doubts . Copperfield 's people had brought a zippered plastic body bag with them . In the kitchen , they slipped the pajama-clad corpse into the bag , then carried it out of the building and left it on the sidewalk , intending to pick it up again on the way back to the mobile labs . Bryce led them to Gilmartin 's Market . Inside , back by the milk coolers where it had happened , he told them about Jake Johnson 's disappearance . " No screams . No sound at all . Just a few seconds of darkness . A few seconds . But when the lights came on again , Jake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Everywhere . " " He could have run away , " Roberts said . " Yes , " Dr. Yamaguchi said . " Maybe he deserted . Considering the things he 'd seen ... " " My God , " Goldstein said , " what if he left Snowfield ? He might be beyond the quarantine line , carrying the infection  --  " " No , no , no . Jake would n't desert , " Bryce said . " He was n't exactly the most aggressive officer on the force , but he would n't run out on me . He was n't irresponsible . " " Definitely not , " Tal agreed . " Besides , Jake 's old man was once county sheriff , so there 's a lot of family pride involved . " " And Jake was a cautious man , " Frank said . " He did n't do anything on impulse . " Bryce nodded . " Anyway , even if he was spooked enough to run , he 'd have taken a squad car . He sure would n't have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " he 'd have known they would n't let him past the roadblock , so he 'd have avoided the highway altogether . He might have gone off through the woods . " Jenny shook her head . " No , General . The land is wild out there . Deputy Johnson would 've known he 'd get lost and die . " " And , " Bryce said , " would a frightened man plunge pell-mell into a strange forest at night ? I do n't think so , General . But I do think it 's time you heard about what happened to my other deputy . " Leaning against a cooler full of cheese and lunchmeat , Bryce told them about the moth , about the attack on Wargle and the bloodcurdling condition of the corpse . He told them about Lisa 's encounter with a resurrectedWargle and about the subsequent discovery that the body was missing . Copperfield and his people expressed astonishment at first , then con/fusion , then fear . But during most of Bryce 's tale , they stared at him in wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telling them about the child 's voice that had come from the kitchen drain just moments before their arrival . Then , for the third time , he said , " Well , General , do you still think it looks like a simple incident of CBW ? " Copperfield hesitated , looked around at the littered market , finally met Bryce 's eyes , and said , " Sheriff , I want Dr. Roberts and Dr. Goldstein to give complete physical examinations to you and to everyone who saw this ... uh . . . moth . " " You do n't believe me . " " Oh , I believe that you genuinely , sincerely think you saw all of those things . " " Damn , " Tal said . Copperfield said , " Surely , you can understand that , to us , it sounds as if you 've all been contaminated , as if you 're suffering from hallucinations . " Bryce was weary of their disbelief and frustrated by their intellectual rigidity . As scientists , they were supposed to be receptive to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force the evidence to conform to their preconceived notions of what they would find in Snowfield . " You think we all could 've had the same hallucination ? " Bryce asked . " Mass hallucinations are n't unknown , " Copperfield said . " General , " Jenny said , " there was absolutely nothing hallucinatory about what we saw . It had the gritty texture of reality . " " Doctor Paige , I would ordinarily accord considerable weight to any observation you cared to make . But as one of those who claim to have seen this moth , your medical judgment in the matter simply is n't objective . " Scowling at Copperfield , Frank Autry said , " But , sir , if it was all just something we hallucinated  --  then where is Stu Wargle ? " " Maybe both he and this Jake Johnson ran out on you , " Roberts said . " And maybe you 've merely incorporated their disappearances into your delusions . " From long experience , Bryce knew that a debate was always lost the moment you became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , leaning against the cooler . Keeping his voice soft and slow , he said , " General , from the things you and your people have said , someone could get the idea that the Santa Mira County Sheriff 's Department is staffed exclusively by cowards , fools , and goldbrickers . " Copperfield made placating gestures with his rubber-sheathed hands . " No , no , no . We 're not saying anything of the kind . Please , Sheriff , try top185understand . We 're only being straightforward with you . We 're telling you how the situation looks to us  --  how it would look to anyone with any specialized knowledge of chemical and biological warfare . Hallucination is one of the things we expect to find in survivors . It 's one of the things we have to look for . Now , if you could offer us a logical explanation for the existence of this eagle-size moth . . . well , maybe then we could come to believe in it ourselves . But you ca n't . Which leaves our suggestion  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense . " Bryce noticed the four soldiers staring at him in a much different way now that he was thought to be a victim of nerve gas . After all , a man suffering from bizarre hallucinations was obviously unstable , dangerous , perhaps even violent enough to cut off people 's heads and pop them into bakery ovens . The soldiers raised their submachine guns an inch or two , although they did n't actually aim at Bryce . They regarded him  --  and Jenny and Tal and Frank  --  with a new and unmistakable air of suspicion . Before Bryce could respond to Copperfield , he was startled by a loud noise at the back of the market , beyond the butcher's-block tables . He stepped away from the cooler , turned toward the source of the commotion , and put his right hand on his holstered revolver . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw two soldiers reacting to him rather than to the noise . When he had put his hand on his revolver , they had instantly raised their submachine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . And a voice . Both were coming from within the walk-in meat locker , on the other side of the butcher 's work area , no more than fifteen feet away , almost directly opposite the point at which Bryce and the others were gathered . The thick , insulated door of the locker muffled the blows that were being rained on it , but they were still loud . The voice was muffled , too , the words unclear , but Bryce thought he could hear someone shouting for help . " Somebody 's trapped in there , " Copperfield said . " Ca n't be , " Bryce said . Frank said , " Ca n't be locked in because the door opens from both sides . " The hammering and shouting ceased abruptly . A clatter . A rattle of metal on metal . The handle on the large , burnished-steel door moved up , down , up , down , up .. . The latch clicked . The door swung open . But only a couple of inches . Then it stopped . The refrigerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in the market . Tendrils of frosty vapor rose along the length of the open door . Although the light was on in the room beyond the door , Bryce could n't see anything through the narrow gap . Nevertheless , he knew what the refrigerated meat locker looked like . During last night 's search for Jake Johnson , Bryce had been in there , poking around . It was a frigid , windowless , claustrophobic place , about twelve by fifteen feet . There was one other door  --  equipped with two deadbolt locks  --  that opened onto the alley for the easy receival of meat deliveries . A painted concrete floor . Sealed concrete walls . Fluorescent lights . Vents in three of the walls circulatedcold air around the sides of beef , veal , and slabs of pork that hung from the ceiling racks . Bryce could hear nothing except the amplified breathing of the scientists and soldiers in the decontamination suits , and even that was subdued ; some of them seemed to be holding their breath . Then from within the locker came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help . Rebounding from the cold concrete walls , carried on the spiraling thermals of air that escaped through the narrowly opened door , the voice was shaky , echo-distorted , yet recognizable . " Bryce . . . Tal . . . ? Who 's out there ? Frank ? Gordy ? Is somebody out there ? Can . . . somebody .. help me ? " It was Jake Johnson . Bryce , Jenny , Tat , and Frank stood very still , listening . Copperfield said , " Whoever it is , he needs help badly . " " Bryce . . . please . . . somebody ... " " You know him ? " Copperfield asked . " He 's calling your name  --  is n't he , Sheriff ? " Without waiting for an answer , the general ordered two of his men  --  Sergeant Harker and Private Pascalli  --  to look in the meat locker . " Wait ! " Bryce said . " Nobody goes back there . We 're keeping these coolers between us and that locker until we know more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate with you as far as possible , you have no authority over my men or me . " " Bryce . . . it 's me ... Jake ... For God 's sake , help me . I broke my damned leg . " " Jake ? " Copperfield asked , squinting curiously at Bryce . " You mean that man in there is the same one you said was snatched away from here last night ? " " Somebody . . . help . . . Jesus , it 's c-cold . , . so c-c-cold . " " It sounds like him , " Bryce admitted . " Well , there you are ! " Copperfield said . " Nothing mysterious about it , after all . He 's been right here all this time . "  |p187Bryce  glared at the general . " I told you we searched everywhere last night . Even in the goddamned meat locker . He was n't there . " " Well , he is now , " the general said . " Hey , out there ! I 'm c-cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jenny touched Bryce 's arm . " It 's wrong . It 's all wrong . " Copperfield said , " Sheriff , we ca n't just stand here and allow an injured man to suffer . " " If Jake had really been in there all night , " Frank Autry said , " he would 've frozen to death by now . " " Well , if it 's a meat locker , " Copperfield said , " then the air inside is n't freezing . It 's just cold . If the man was warmly dressed he might easily have survived this long . " " But how 'd he get in there in the first place ? " Frank asked . " What the devil 's he been doing in there ? " " And he was n't in there last night , " Tal said impatiently . Jake Johnson called for help again . " There 's danger here , " Bryce told Copperfield . " I sense it . My men sense it . Dr. Paige senses it . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been in Snowfield long enough to understand that you 've got to expect the utterly unexpected . " " Like moths the size of eagles ? " Biting back his anger , Bryce said , " You have n't been here long enough to understand that . . . well . . . nothing 's quite what it seems . " Copperfield studied him skeptically . " Do n't get mystical on me , Sheriff . In the meat locker , Jake Johnson began to cry . His whimpering pleas were awful to hear . He sounded like a pain-racked , terrified old man . He did n't sound the least bit dangerous . " We 've got to help that man now , " Copperfield said . " I 'm not risking my men , " Bryce said . " Not yet . " Copperfield again ordered Sergeant Harker and Private Pascalli to look in the meat locker . Although it was obvious from his demeanor that he did n't think there was much danger for men armed with submachine guns , he told them to proceed with caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bacterium or molecule of nerve gas . The two soldiers hurried along the rows of coolers toward the gate that led into the butcher 's work area . Frank said , " If Jake could open the door , why could n't he push it completely open and let us see him ? " " He probably used up the last of his strength just getting the doorp188unlatched , " Copperfield said . " You can hear it in his voice , for God 's sake . Utter exhaustion . " Harker and Pascalli went through the gate , behind the coolers . Bryce 's hand tightened on the butt of his holstered revolver . Tal Whitman said , " There 's too much wrong with this setup , damn it . Ifit 's really Jake , if he needs help , why did he wait until now to open the door ? " " The only way we 'll find out is to ask him , " the general said . " No , I mean , there 's an outside entrance to that locker , " Tal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the alley . As quiet asthis town is , we 'd have heard him all the way over at the Hilltop . " " Maybe he 's been unconscious until now , " Copperfield said . Harker and Pascalli were moving past the worktables and the electricmeat saw . Jake Johnson called out again : " Is someone . . . coming ? Is someone .. . coming now ? " Jenny began to raise another objection , but Bryce said , " Save your breath . " " Doctor , " Copperfield said , " can you actually expect us to just ignore that man 's cries for help ? " " Of course not , " she said . " But we ought to take time to think of a safe way of having a look in there . " Shaking his head , Copperfield interrupted her : " We 've got to attend to him without delay . Listen to him , Doctor . He 's hurt bad . " Jake was moaning in pain againHarker moved toward the meat locker door . Pascalli dropped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering his sergeant as best he could . Bryce felt the muscles bunching with tension in his back , across his shoulders , and in his neck . Harker was at the door . " No , " Jenny said softly . The locker door was hinged to swing inward . Harker reached out with the barrel of his submachine gun and shoved the door all the way open . The cold hinges rasped and squealed . That sound sent a shiver through Bryce . Jake was n't sprawled in the doorway . He was n't anywhere in sight . Past the sergeant , nothing could seen except the hanging sides of beef : dark , fat-mottled , bloody . Harker hesitated(Do n't do it ! Bryce thought. )  |  --  and then plunged through the doorway . He crossed the threshold in a crouch , looking left and swinging the gun that way , then almost instantly looking right and bringing the muzzle around . To his right , Harker saw something . He jerked upright in surprise and fear . Stumbling hastily backwards , he collided with a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cry with a short burst of fire from his submachine gun . Bryce winced . The boom-rattle of the weapon was thunderous . Something pushed against the far side of the meat locker door and slammed it shut . Harker was trapped in there with it . It . " Christ ! " Bryce said . Not wasting the time it would have taken to run to the gate , Bryce clambered up onto the waist-high cooler in front of him , stepping on packetsof Kraft Swiss cheese and wax-encased gouda . He scrambled across and dropped off the other side , into the butcher 's area . Another burst of gunfire . Longer this time . Maybe even long enough to empty the gun 's magazine . Pascalli was at the locker door , struggling frantically with the handle . Bryce rounded the worktables . " What 's wrong ? " Private Pascalli looked too young to be in the army  --  and very scared . " Let 's get him the hell out of there ! " Bryce said . " Ca n't ! This fucker wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . The screaming began . Pascalli wrenched desperately at the unrelenting handle . Although the thick , insulated door muffled Harker 's screams , they were nevertheless loud , and they swiftly grew even louder . Coming through the walkie-talkie built into Pascalli 's suit , the agonized wailing must have been deafening , for the private suddenly put a hand to his helmeted head as if trying to block out the sound . Bryce pushed the soldier aside . He gripped the long , lever-action door handle with both hands . It would n't budge up or down . In the locker , the piercing screams rose and fell and rose , getting louder and shriller and more horrifying . What in the hell is it doing to Harker ? Bryce wondered . Skinning the poor bastard alive ? He looked back toward the coolers . Tal had scrambled over the display case and was coming on the double . The general and another soldier , Private Fodor , were rushing through the gate . Frank had jumped onto onep190of the coolers but was facing out toward the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion at the meat locker was just a diversion . Everyone else was still standing in a group , in the aisle beyond the coolers . Bryce shouted , " Jenny ! " " Yeah ? " " Does this store have a hardware section ? " " Odds and ends . " " I need a screwdriver . " " Can do . " She was already running . Harker screamed . Jesus , what a terrible cry it was . Out of a nightmare . Out of a lunatic asylum . Out of Hell . Just listening to it caused Bryce to break out in cold sweat . Copperfield reached the locker . " Let me at that handle . " " It 's no use . " " Let me at it ! " Bryce got out of the way . The general was a big brawny man  --  the biggest man here , in fact . He looked strong enough to uproot century-old oaks . Straining , cursing , he moved the door handle no farther than Bryce had done . " The goddamned latch must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harker screamed and screamed . Bryce thought of Liebermann 's Bakery . The rolling pin on the table . The hands . The severed hands . This was the way a man might scream while he watched his hands being cut off at the wrists . Copperfield pounded on the door in rage and frustration . Bryce glanced at Tal . This was a first : Talbert Whitman visibly frightened . Calling to Bryce , Jenny came through the gate . She had three screwdrivers , each of them sealed in a brightly colored cardboard and plastic package . " Did n't know which size you needed , " she said . " Okay , " Bryce said , reaching for the tools , " now get out of here fast . Go back with the others , " Ignoring his command , she gave him two of the screwdrivers , but she held on to the third . Harker 's screams had become so shrill , so awful , that they no longer sounded human . As Bryce ripped open one package , Jenny tore the third bright yellow container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a doctor . I stay . " " He 's beyond any doctor 's help , " Bryce said , frantically tearing open the second package . " Maybe not . If you thought there was n't a chance , you would n't be trying to get him out of there . " " Damn it , Jenny ! " He was worried about her , but he knew he would n't be able to persuade her to leave if she had already made up her mind to stay . He took the third screwdriver from her , shouldered past General Copperfield , and returned to the door . He could n't remove the door 's hinge pins . It swung into the locker , so the hinges were on the inside . But the lever-action handle fitted through a large cover plate behind which lay the lock mechanism . The plate was fastened to the face of the door by four screws . Bryce hunkered down in front of it , selected the most suitable screwdriver , and removed the first screw , letting it drop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost worse than the screams . Bryce removed the second , third , and fourth screws . There was still no sound from Sergeant Harker . When the cover plate was loose , Bryce slid it along the handle , pulled it rree , and discarded it . He squinted at the guts of the lock , probed at the mechanism with the screwdriver . In response , ragged bits of torn metal popped out of the lock ; other pieces rattled down through a hollow space in the interior of the door . The lock had been thoroughly mangled from within the door . He found the manual release slot in the shaft of the latch bolt , slid the screwdriver through it , pulled to the right . The spring seemed to have been badly bent or sprung , for there was very little play left in it . Nevertheless , he drew the bolt back far enough to bring it out of the hole in the jamb , then pushed inward . Something clicked ; the door started to swing open . Everyone , including Bryce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight contributed sufficiently to its momentum , so that it continued to swing slowly , slowly inward . Private Pascalli was covering it with his submachine gun , and Bryce drew his own handgun , as did Copperfield , although Sergeant Harker had conclusivelyproved that such weapons were useless . The door swung all the way open . Bryce expected something to rush out at them . Nothing did . Looking through the doorway and across the locker , he could see that the outer door was open , too , which it definitely had n't been when Harkerp192had gone inside a couple of minutes ago . Beyond it lay the sun-splashed alleyway . Copperfield ordered Pascalli and Fodor to secure the locker . They went through the door fast , one turning to the left , the other to the right , out of sight . In a few seconds , Pascalli returned . " It 's all clear , sir . " Copperfield went into the locker , and Bryce followed . Harker 's submachine gun was lying on the floor . Sergeant Harker was hanging from the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging on an enormous , wickedly pointed , two-pronged meat hook that had been driven through his chest . Bryce 's stomach heaved . He started to turn away from the hanging man  --  and then realised it was n't really Harker . It was only the sergeant 's decontamination suit and helmet , hanging slack , empty . The tough vinyl fabric was slashed . The plexiglass faceplate was broken and torn half out of the rubber gasket into which it had been firmly set . Harker had been pulled from the suit before it had been impaled . But where was Harker ? Gone . Another one . Just gone . Pascalli and Fodor were out on the loading platforifi , looking up and down the alleyway . " All that screaming , " Jenny said , stepping up beside Bryce , " yet there 's no blood on the floor or on the suit . " Tal Whitman scooped up several expended shell casings that had been spat out by the submachine gun ; scores of them littered the floor . The brass casings gleamed in his open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see many slugs . Looks like the sergeant hit what he was shooting at . Must 've scored at least a hundred hits . Maybe two hundred . How many rounds are in one of those big magazines , General ? " Copperfield stared at the shiny casings but did n't answer . Pascalli and Fodor came back in from the loading platform , and Pascalli said , " There 's no sign of him out there , sir . You want us to search farther along the alley ? " ' Before Copperfield could respond , Bryce said , " General , you 've got to write off Sergeant Harker , painful as that might be . He 's dead . Do n't hold out any hope for him . Death is what this is all about . Death . Not hostagetaking . Not terrorism . Not nerve gas . There 's nothing halfway about this . We 're playing for all the marbles . I do n't know exactly what the hell 's out there or where it came from , but I do know that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't even imagine yet , driven by somep193purpose we might never understand . The moth that killed Stu Warglethatwas n't even the true appearance of this thing . I feel it . The moth was like the reanimation of Wargle 's body , when he went after Lisa in the restroom : It was a bit of misdirection . . . sleight-of-hand . " " A phantom , " Tal said , using the word that Copperfield had introduced with somewhat different meaning . " A phantom , yes , " Bryce said . " We have n't yet encountered the real enemy . It 's something that just plain likes to kill . It can kill quickly and silently , the way it took Jake Johnson . But it killed Harker more slowly , hurting him real bad , making him scream . Because it wanted us to hear those screams . Harker 's murder was sort of like what you said about T-139 : It was a demoralizer . This thing did n't carry Sergeant Harker away . It got him , General . It got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a corpse . " Copperfield was silent for a moment . Then he said , " But the voice we heard . It was your man , Jake Johnson . " " No , " Bryce said . " I do n't think it really was Jake . It sounded like him , but now I 'm beginning to suspect we 're up against something that 's a terrific mimic . " " Mimic ? " Copperfield said . Jenny looked at Bryce . " Those animal sounds on the telephone . " " Yeah . The cats , dogs , birds , rattlesnakes , the crying child . . . It was almost like a performance . As if it were bragging : Hey , look what I can do ; look how clever I am . ' Jake Johnson 's voice was just one more impersonationin its repertoire . " " What are you proposing ? " Copperfield asked . " Something super-natural ? " " No . This is real . " " Then what ? Put a name to it , " Copperfield demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe it 's a natural mutation or even something that came out of a genetic engineering lab somewhere . You know anything about that , General ? Maybe the army 's got an entire goddamneddivision of geneticists creating biological fighting machines , manmademonsters designed to slaughter and terrorize , creatures stitched togetherfrom the DNA of half a dozen animals . Take some of the genetic structure of the tarantula and combine it with some of the genetic structure of the crocodile , the cobra , the wasp , maybe even the grizzly bear , and then insert the genes for human intelligence just for the hell of it . Put it all in a test tube ; incubate it ; nurture it . What would you get ? What would it look like ? Do I sound like a raving lunatic for even proposing such a thing ? Frankenstein with a modem twist ? Have they actually gone that far withp194recombinant DNA research ? Maybe I should n't even have ruled out the supernatural . What I 'm trying to say , General , is that it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to it . Let your imagination run wild , General . No matter what hideous thing you conjure up , we ca n't rule it out . We 're dealing with the unknown , and the unknown encompasses all our nightmares . " Copperfield stared at him , then looked up at Sergeant Harker 's suit and helmet which hung from the meat hook . He turned to Pascalli and Fodor . " We wo n't search the alley . The sheriff is probably right . Sergeant Harker is lost , and there 's nothing we can do for him . " For the fourth time since Copperfield had arrived in town , Bryce said , " Do you still think it looks as if we 're dealing with just a simple incident of CBW ? " " Chemical or biological agents might be involved , " Copperfield said . " As you observed , we ca n't rule out anything . But it 's not a simple case . You 're right about that , Sheriff . I 'm sorry for suggesting you were only hallucinating and  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories ? " Jenny asked . " Well , " Copperfield said , " I want to start the first autopsy and pathologytests right away . Maybe we wo n't find a disease or a nerve gas , but we still might find something that 'll give us a clue . " " You 'd better do that , sir , " Tal said . " Because I have a hunch that time is running out . " Corporal Billy Velazquez , one of General Copperfield 's support troops , climbed down through the manhole , into the storm drain . Although he had n't exerted himself , he was breathing hard . Because he was scared . What had happened to Sergeant Harker ? The others had come back , looking stunned . Old man Copperfield said Harker was dead . He said they were n't quite sure what had killed Sarge , but they intended to find out . Man , that was bullshit . They must knowp195what killed him . They just did n't want to say . That was typical of the brass , making secrets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical pipe , then into the main , horizontal drain . Billy reached the bottom . His booted feet made hard , flat sounds when they struck the concrete floor . The tunnel was n't high enough to allow him to stand erect . He crouched slightly and swept his flashlight around . Gray concrete walls . Telephone and power company pipes . A little moisture . Some fungus here and there . Nothing else . Billy stepped away from the ladder as Ron Peake , another member of the support squad , came down into the drain . Why had n't they at least brought Harker 's body back with them when they 'd returned from Gilmartin 's Market ? Billy kept shining his flashlight around and glancing nervously behind him . Why had old Iron Ass Copperfield kept stressing the need to be watchful and careful down here ? Sir , what 're we supposed to be on the lookout for ? Billy had asked . Copperfield had said , Anything . Everything . I do n't know if there 's any danger or not . And even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you to look for . Just be damned cautious . And if anything moves down there , no matter how innocent it looks , even if it 's just a mouse , get your asses out of there fast . Now what the hell kind of answer was that ? Jesus . It gave him the creeps . Billy wished he 'd had a chance to talk to Pascalli or Fodor . They were n't the damned brass . They would give him the whole story about Harker  --  if he ever got a chance to ask them about it . Ron Peake reached the bottom of the ladder . He looked anxiously at Billy . Velazquez directed the flashlight all the way around them in order to show the other man there was nothing to worry about . Ron switched on his own flash and smiled self-consciously , embarrassed by his jumpiness . The men above began to feed a power cable through the open manhole . It led back to the two mobile laboratories , which were parked a few yards from the entrance to the drain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shuffling forward in a crouch , led the way east . On the street above , the other men paid out more cable into the drain.  |p196This  tunnel should intersect an equally large or perhaps larger conduit under the main street , Skyline Road . At that point there ought to be a power company junction box where several strands of the town 's electrical web were joined together . As Billy proceeded with all the caution that Copperfield had suggested , he played the beam of his flashlight over the walls of the tunnel , looking for the power company 's insignia . The junction box was on the left , five or six feet this side of the intersectionof the two conduits . Billy walked past it , to the Skyline Road drain , leaned out into the passageway , and pointed his light to the right and to the left , making sure there was nothing lurking around . The Skyline Road pipe was the same size as the one in which he now stood , but it followed the slope of the street above it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking downhill , into the dwindling gray bore of the tunnel , Billy Velazquez was reminded of a story he 'd read years ago in a horror comic . He 'd forgotten the title of it . The tale was about a bank robber who killed two people during a holdup and then , fleeing police , slipped into the city 's storm drain system . The villain had taken a downward-sloping tunnel , figuring it would lead to the river , but-where it had led , instead , was to Hell . That was what the Skyline Road drain looked like as it fell down , down , down : a road to Hell . Billy turned to peer uphill again , wondering if it would look like a road to Heaven . But it looked the same both ways . Up or down , it looked like a road to Hell . What had happened to Sergeant Harker ? Would the same thing happen to everyone , sooner or later ? Even to William Luis Velazquez , who had always been so sure ( until now ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uddenly dry . He turned his head inside his helmet and put his parched lips on the nipple of the nutrient tube . He sucked on it , drawing a sweet , cool , carbohydrate-packed , vitamin-and-mineral-rich fluid into his mouth . What he wanted was a beer . But until he could get out of this suit , the nutrient solution was the only thing available . He carried about a forty-eight-hour supply  --  if he did n't take more than two ounces an hour . Turning away from the road to Hell , he went to the junction box . Ron Peake was at work already . Moving efficiently despite their bulky decon suits and the cramped quarters , they tapped into the power supply . The unit had brought its own generator , but it would be used only if the more convenient municipal power were lost . In a few minutes , Velazquez and Peake were finished . Billy used his suit/to-suit radio to call up to the surface . " General , we 've made the tap . You should have power now , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now get your asses out of there on the double ! " " Yes , sir , " Billy said . Then he heard . . . something . Rustling . Panting . And Ron Peake grabbed Billy 's shoulder . Pointed . Past him . Back toward the Skyline drain . Billy whirled around , crouched down even farther , and shone his flashlightout into the intersection , where Peake 's flash was focused . Animals were streaming down the Skyline Road tunnel . Dozens upon dozens . Dogs . White and gray and black and brown and rust-red and golden , dogs of all sizes and descriptions : mostly mutts but also beagles , toy poodles , full-size poodles , German shepherds , spaniels , two Great Danes , a couple of Airedales , a schnauzer , a pair of coal-black Dobermans with brown-trimmed muzzles . And there were cats , too . Big and small . Lean cats and fat cats . Black and calico and white and yellow and ring-tailed and brown and spotted and striped and gray cats . None of the dogs barked or growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sounds were their panting and the soft padding and scraping of their paws on the concrete . The animals poured down through the drain with a curious intensity , all of them looking straight ahead , none of them even glancing into the intersectingdrain , where Billy and Ron Peake stood . " What 're they doing down here ? " Billy wanted to know . " How 'd they get here ? " From the street above , Copperfield radioed down : " What 's wrong ? Velazquez ? " Billy was so amazed by the procession of animals that he did n't immediatelyrespond . Other animals began to appear , mixed in among the cats and dogs . Squirrels . Rabbits . A gray fox . Raccoons . More foxes and more squirrels . Skunks . All of them were staring straight ahead , oblivious of everything except the need to keep moving . Possums and badgers . Mice and chipmunks . Coyotes . All rushing down the road to Hell , swarming over and around and under one another , yet never once stumbling or hesitating or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , continuous , and harmonious as flowing water . " Velazquez ! Peake ! Report in ! " " Animals , " Billy told the general . " Dogs , cats , raccoons , all kinds of things . A river of ' em . "  | " Sir , they 're running down the Skyline tunnel , just beyond the mouth of this pipe , " Ron Peake said . " Underground , " Billy said , baffled . " It 's crazy . " " Retreat , goddamnit ! " Copperfield said urgently . " Get out of there now . Now ! " Billy remembered the general 's warning , issued just before they had descended through the manhole : If anything moves down there . . . even if it 's just a mouse , get your asses out of there fast . Initially , the subterranean parade of animals had been startling but not particularly frightening . Now , the bizarre procession was suddenly eerie , even threatening . And now there were snakes among the animals . Scores of them . Long blacksnakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two above the floor of the storm drain . And there were rattlers , their flat and evil heads held lower than those of the longer blacksnakes , but moving just as fast and just as sinuously , swarming with mysterious purpose toward a dark and equally mysterious destination . Although the snakes paid no more attention to Velazquez and Peake than the dogs and cats did , their slithering arrival was enough to snap Billy out of his trance . He hated snakes . He turned back the way he had come , prodded Peake . " Go. : Go on . Get out of here . Run ! " Something shrieked-screamed-roared . Billy 's heart pounded with jackhammer ferocity . The sound came from the Skyline drain , from back there on the road to Hell . Billy did n't dare look back . It was neither a human scream nor like any animal sound , yet it was unquestionably the cry of a living thing . There was no mistaking the raw emotions of that alien , blood-freezing bleat . It was n't a scream of fear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feverish blood-hunger . Fortunately , that malevolent roar did n't come from nearby , but from farther up the mountain , toward the uppermost end of the Skyline conduit . The beast  --  whatever in God 's name it was  --  was at least not already upon them . But it was coming fast . Ron Peake hurried back toward the ladder , and Billy followed . Encumberedby their bulky decontamination suits , slowed by the curved floor of the pipe , they ran in a lurching shuffle . Although they had n't far to go , their progress was maddeningly slow . The thing in the tunnel cried out again . Closer . It was a whine and a snarl and a howl and a roar and a petulant squeal all tangled together , a barbed-wire sound that punctured Billy 's ears and raked cold metal spikes across his heart . Closer.  |p199If  Billy Velazquez had been a God-fearing Nazarene or a Bible-thumping , fire-and-brimstone , fundamentalist Christian , he would have known what beast might make such a cry . If he had been taught that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleshy forms , seeking unwary souls to devour , he would have identified this beast at once . He would have said , " It 's Satan . " The roar echoing through the concrete tunnels was truly that terrible . And closer . Getting closer . Coming fast . But Billy was a Catholic . Modern Catholicism tended to downplay the sulphurous-pits-of-Hell stories in favor of emphasizing God 's great mercy and infinite compassion . Extremist Protestant fundamentalists saw the hand of the Devil in everything from television programming to the novels of Judy Blume to the invention of the push-up bra . But Catholicism struck a quieter , more light-hearted note than that . The Church of Rome now gave the world such things as singing nuns , Wednesday Night Bingo , and priests like Andrew Greeley . Therefore , Billy Velazquez , raised a Catholic , did not immediately associate supernatural Satanic forces with the chilling cry of this unknown beast  --  not even though he so vividly remembered that old road-to-Hell comic book story . Billy just knew that the bellowing creature approaching through the bowels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was getting closer . Much closer . Ron Peake reached the ladder , started up , dropped his flashlight , did n't bother to return for it . Peake was too slow , and Billy shouted at him : " Move your ass ! " The scream of the unknown beast had become an eerie ululation that filled the subterranean warren of storm drains as completely as floodwater . Billy could n't even hear himself shouting . Peake was halfway up the ladder . There was almost enough room for Billy to slip in under him and start up . He put one hand on the ladder . Peake 's foot slipped . He dropped down a rung . Billy cursed and snatched his hand out of the way , The banshee keening grew louder . Closer , closer . Peake 's fallen flashlight was pointing off toward the Skyline drain , but Billy did n't look back that way . He stared only up toward the sunlight . If he glanced behind and saw something hideous , his strength would flee him , and he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God , it would get him . Peake scrambled upwards again . His feet stayed on the rungs this time.  |p200The  concrete drain was transmitting thunderous vibrations that Billy could feel through the soles of his boots . The vibrations were like heavy , lumbering , yet lightning-quick footsteps . Do n't look , do n't look ! Billy grabbed the sides of the ladder and clawed his way up as rapidly as Peake 's progress would allow . One rung . Two . Three . Above , Peake passed through the manhole and into the street . With Peake out of the way , a fall of autumn sunlight splashed down over Billy Velazquez , and there was something about it that was like light piercing a church window  --  maybe because it represented hope . He was halfway up the ladder . Going to make it , going to make it , definitely going to make it , he told himself breathlessly . But the shrieking and howling , Jesus , like being in the center of a cyclone ! Another rung . And another one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ton . A suit of armor . Weighing him down . He was in the vertical pipe now , moving out of the horizontal drain that ran beneath the street . He looked up longingly at the light and the faces peering down at him , and he kept moving . Going to make it . His head rose through the manhole . Someone reached out , offering a hand . It was Copperfield himself . Behind Billy , the shrieking stopped . He climbed another rung , let go of the ladder with one hand , and reached for the general -- but something seized his legs from below before he could grasp Copperfield'shand . " No ! " Something grabbed him , wrenched his feet off the ladder , and yanked him away . Screaming  --  strangely , he heard himself screaming for his mother  --  Billy went down , cracking his helmet against the wall of the pipe and then against a rung of the ladder , stunning himself , smashing his elbows and knees , trying desperately to catch hold of a rung but failing , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to drag him backwards toward the Skyline conduit . He twisted , kicked , struck out with his fists , to no effect . He was held tightly and dragged deeper into the drains . In the backsplash of light coming through the manhole , then in the rapidly dimming beam of Peake 's discarded flashlight , Billy saw a bit of thep201thing that had him in its grip . Not much . Fragments looming out of the shadows , then vanishing into darkness again . He saw just enough to make his bowels and bladder loosen . It was lizardlike . But not a lizard . Insectlike . But not an insect . It hissed and mewled and snarled . It snapped and tore at his suit as it pulled him along . It had cavernous jaws and teeth . Jesus , Mary , and Joseph  --  the teeth ! A double row of razor-edge spikes . It had claws , and it was huge , and its eyes were smoky red with elongated pupils as black as the bottom of a grave . It had scales instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above its baleful eyes , curving out and up , as sharply pointed as daggers . A snout rather than a nose , a snout that oozed snot . A forked tongue that flickered in and out and in and out across all those deadly fangs , and something that looked like the stinger on a wasp or maybe a pincer . It dragged Billy Velazquez into the Skyline conduit . He clawed at the concrete , desperately seeking something to hold on to , but he only succeeded in abrading away the fingers and palms of his gloves . He felt the cool underground air on his hands , and he realized he might now be contaminated , but that was the least of his worries . It dragged him into the hammering heart of darkness . It stopped , held him tightly . It tore at his suit . It cracked his helmet . It pried at his plexiglassfaceplate . It was after him as if he were a delicious morsel of nut meat in a hard shell . His hold on sanity was tenuous at best , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . At first , it seemed to him that this was a prehistoric creature , something millions of years old that had somehow dropped through a time warp into the storm drains . But that was crazy . He felt a silvery , high-pitched , lunatic giggle coming over him , and he knew he would be lost if he gave voice to it . The beast tore away most of his decontamination suit . It was on him now , pressing hard , a cold and disgustinglyslick thing that seemed to pulse and somehow to change when it touched him . Billy , gasping and weeping , suddenly remembered an illustrationin an old catechism text . A drawing of a demon . That was what this was . Like the drawing . Yes , exactly like it . The horns . The dark , forked tongue . The red eyes . A demon risen from Hell . And then he thought : No , no ; that 's crazy , too ! And all the while that those thoughts raced through his mind , the ravenous creature stripped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelieved darkness , he sensed its snout pressing through the halves of the broken helmet , toward his face , sniffing . He felt its tongue fluttering against his mouth and nose . He smelled a vague but repellent odor , like nothing he had ever smelled before . The beast gouged at his belly and thighs , and then he felt a strange and brutally painful fire eating into him ; acid fire . He writhed , twisted , bucked , strained  --  all to nop202avail . Billy heard himself crying out in terror and pain and confusion : " It 's the Devil , it 's the Devil ! " He realized he had been shouting and screaming things almost continuously , from the moment he had been dragged off the ladder . Now , unable to speak as the flameless fire burned his lungs to ash and churned into his throat , he prayed in a silent singsong chant , warding off fear and death and the terrible feeling of smallness and worthlessness that had come over him : Mary , Mother of God , Mary , hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for me . . . pray , pray for me , Mary , Mother of God , Mary , intercede for me andHis question had been answered . He knew what had happened to Sergeant Harker . Galen Copperfield was an outdr Jrsman , and he knew a great deal about the wildlife of North America . One of the creatures he found most interestingwas the trap-door spider . It was a clever engineer , constructing a deep , tubular nest in the ground with a hinged lid at the top . The lid blended so perfectly with the soil in which it was set that other insects wandered across it , unaware of the danger below , and were instantly snatched into the nest , dragged down , and devoured . The suddenness of it was horrifying and fascinating . One instant , the prey was there , standing atop the trap-door , and the next instant it was gone , as if it had never been . Corporal Velazquez 's disappearance was as sudden as if he had stepped upon the lid of a trap-door spider 's lair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harker 's disappearance and were frightened by the nightmarish howling that ceased just before Velazquezwas dragged down . When the corporal was taken , they all stumbled hack across the street , afraid that something was about to launch itself out of the manhole . Copperfield , in the act of reaching for Velazquez when he was snatched , jumped back . Then froze . Indecisive . That was not like him . He had never before been indecisive in a crisis . Velazquez was screaming through the suit-to-suit radio . Breaking the ice that locked his joints , Copperfield went to the manhole and looked down . Peake 's flashlight lay on the floor of the drain . But there was nothing else . No sign of Velazquez . Copperfield hesitated . The corporal continued to scream . Send other men down after the poor bastard ? No . It would be a suicide mission . Remember Harker . Cut the losses here , now.  |p203But  , good God , the screaming was terrible . Not as awful as Harker 's . Those had been screams born of excruciating pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , perhaps , but bad enough . As bad as anything Copperfield had heard on the battlefield . There were words among the screams , spat out in explosive gasps . The corporal was making a desperate , babbling attempt to explain to those aboveground  --  and maybe to himself  --  just what he was seeing. " ... lizard ... " ... bug .. " " ... dragon ... " " ... prehistoric ... " " . . . demon ... " And finally , with both physical pain and anguish of the soul in his voice , the corporal cried out , " It 's the Devil , it 's the Devil ! " After that , the screams were every bit as bad as Harker 's . At least these did n't last as long . When there was only silence , Copperfield slid the manhole cover back into place . Because of the power cable , the metal plate did n't fit tightly and was tilted up at one end , but it covered most of the hole . He stationed two men on the sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered them to shoot anything that came out . Because a gun had been of no help to Harker , Copperfield and a few other men collected everything they needed to manufacture Molotov cocktails . They got a couple of dozen bottles of wine from Brookhart 's liquor store on Vail Lane , emptied them , put an inch of soap powder in the bottom of each , filled them with gasoline , and twisted rag fuses into the necks of them until they were snugly stoppered . Would fire succeed where bullets had failed ? What had happened to Harker ? What had happened to Velazquez ? What will happen to me ? Copperfield wondered . The first of the two mobile field laboratories had cost more than three million dollars , and the Defense Department had gotten its money 's worth . The lab was a marvel of technological microminiaturization . For one thing , its computer  --  based on a trio of Intel 432 micromainframes ; 690,000 transistors squeezed onto only nine silicon chips  --  took up no more room than a couple of suitcases , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical analyses . In fact , it was a more elaborate system  --  with greater logic and memory capacities  --  than could be found in most major university hospitals ' pathology labs.  |p204There  was a great deal of diagnostic equipment in the motor home , all of it designed and positioned for maximum utilization of the limited space . In addition to a pair of computer access terminals along one wall , there were a number of devices and machines : a centrifuge that would be used to separatethe major components of blood , urine , and other fluid samples ; a spectrophotometer ; a spectrogrr ph ; an electron microscope with an image **26;10692;TOOLONG read-out link to one of the computer screens ; a compact appliance that would quick-freeze blood and tissue samples for storage and for use in tests in which element extractions were more easily performed on frozen materials ; and much , much more . Toward the front of the vehicle , behind the drivers ' compartment , was an autopsy table that collapsed into the wall when not in use . At the moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  male , thirty-seven , Caucasian  --  lay on the stainless-steel surface . The blue pajamabottoms had been scissored away from the corpse and set aside for later examination . Dr. Seth Goldstein , one of the three leading forensic medicine specialists on the West Coast , would perform the autopsy . He stood at one side of the table with Dr. Daryl Roberts , and General Copperfield stood at the other side , facing them across the dead body . Goldstein pressed a button on a control panel that was set in the wall to his right . A recording would be made of every word spoken during the autopsy ; this was common procedure in even ordinary postmortems . A visual record was also being made : two ceiling-mounted videotape cameras were focused on the corpse ; they , too , were activated when Dr. Goldstein pressed the button on the wall panel . Goldstein began by closely examining and describing the corpse : the unusual facial expression , the universal bruising , the curious swelling . He was especially searching for punctures , abrasions , localized contusions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications of specific points of injury . He could not find any . With his gloved hand poised over the instrument tray , Goldstein hesitated , not quite sure where to start . Usually , at the beginning of an autopsy , he already had a pretty good idea of the cause of death . When the deceased had been wasted by a disease , Goldstein usually had seen the hospital report . If death had resulted from an accident , there were visible trauma . If it was death at the hand of another , there were signs of violence . But in this case , the conditions of the corpse raised more questions than it answered , strange questions unlike any he had ever faced before . As if sensing Goldstein 's thoughts , Copperfield said , " You 've got to find some answers for us , Doctor . Our lives very probably depend on it . "  |p205The  second motor home had many of the same diagnostic machines and instruments that were in the lead vehicle  --  a test tube centrifuge , an electronmicroscope , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not duplicated in the other vehicle . It contained no autopsy table , however , and only one videotape system . There were three computerterminals instead of two . Dr. Enrico Valdez was sitting at one of the programming boards , in a deep-seated chair designed to accommodate a man in a decontamination suit complete with air tank . He was working with Houk and Niven on chemical analyses of samples of various substances collected from several business places and dwellings along Skyline Road and Vail Lane  --  such as the flour and dough taken from the table in Liebermann 's Bakery . They were seeking traces of nerve gas condensate or other chemical substances . Thus far , they had found nothing out of the ordinary . Dr. Valdez did n't believe that nerve gas or disease would turn out to be the culprit . He was beginning to wonder if this whole thing might actually be in Isley 's and Arkham 's territory . Isley and Arkham , the two men without names on their decontamination suits , were not even members of the Civilian Defense Unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , before dawn , when Dr. Valdez had been introduced to them at the team rendezvous point in Sacramento , when he had heard what kind of research they were doing , he had almost laughed . He had thought their project was a waste of taxpayers ' money . Now he was n't so sure . Now he wondered .. . He wondered . . . and he worried. * *Dr . Sara Yamaguchi was also in the second motor home . She was preparing bacteria cultures . Using a sample of blood taken from the body of Gary Wechlas , she was methodically contaminating a series of growth media , jellied compounds filled with nutrients on which bacteria generally thrived : horse blood agar , sheep blood agar , simplex , chocolate agar , and many others . Sara Yamaguchi was a geneticist who had spent eleven years in recombinantDNA research . If it developed that Snowfield had been stricken by a man-made microorganism , Sara 's work would become central to the investigation . She would direct the study of the microbe 's morphology , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to determine the function of the bug . Like Dr. Valdez , Sara Yamaguchi had begun to wonder if Isley and Arkham might become more essential to the investigation than she hadp206thought . This morning , fLeir area of expertise had seemed as exotic as voodoo . But now , in light of what had taken place since the team 's arrival in Snowfield , she was forced to admit that Isley 's and Arkham 's specialty seemed increasingly pertinent . And like Dr. Valdez , she was worried . Dr. Wilson Bettenby , chief of the civilian scientific arm of the CBW Civilian Defense Unit 's West Coast team , sat at a computer terminal , two seats away from Dr. Valdez . Bettenby was running an automated analysis program on several water samples . The samples were inserted into a processor that distilled the water , stored the distillate , and subjected the filtered-out substances to spectrographic analysis and other tests . Bettenby was not searching for microorganisms ; that would require different procedures than these . This machine only identified and quantified all mineral and chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cathode ray tube . All but one of the water samples had been taken from taps in the kitchens and bathrooms of houses and businesses along Vail Lane . They proved to be free of dangerous chemical impurities . The other water sample was the one that Deputy Autry had collected from the kitchen floor of the apartment on Vail Lane , sometime last night . According to Sheriff Hammond , puddles of water and saturated carpets had been discovered in several buildings . By this morning , however , the water had pretty much evaporated , except for a couple of damp carpets from which Bettenby would n't have been able to obtain a clean sample . He put the deputy 's sample into the processor . In a few minutes , the computer flashed up the complete chemical-mineralanalysis of the water and of the residue that remained after all of the liquid in the sample had been distilled : PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT OF SOLUTION OF RESIDUE OF SOLUTION OF RESIDUEH 11.188 00.00 HE 00.00 00.00LI 00.00 00.00 BE 00,00 00.00B 00.00 00.00 C 00.00 00.00N 00.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 00.00 00.00 SI 00.00 00.00P 00.00 00.00 S 00.00 00.00 CL 00.00 00.00 K 00.00 00.00p207The computer went on at considerably greater length , flashing up the findings for every substance that might ordinarily be detected . The results were the same . In its undistilled state , the water contained absolutely no traces of any elements other than its two components , hydrogen and oxygen . And complete distillation and filtration had left behind no residue whatsoever , not even any trace elements . Autry 's sample could n't have come from the town 's water supply , for it was neither chlorinated nor fluoridated . It was n't bottled water , either . Bottled water would have had a normal mineral content . Perhaps there was a filtration system underneath the kitchen sink in that apartment  --  a Culligan unit  --  but even if there was , the water that passed through it would still possess more mineral content than this . What Autry had collected was the purest laboratory grade of distilled and multiply filtered water . So . . . what was it doing all over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning . Was the small lake at Brookhart 's liquor store also composed of this ultrapure water ? Why would anyone go around town emptying out gallons and gallons of distilled water ? And where would they find it in such quantity to begin with ? Strange . Jenny , Bryce , and Lisa were at a table in one corner of the dining room at the Hilltop Inn . Major Isley and Captain Arkham , who wore the decontamination suits that had no names on the helmets , were sitting on two stools , across the table . They had brought the news about Corporal Velazquez . They had also brought a tape recorder , which was now in the center of the table . " I still do n't see why this ca n't wait , " Bryce said . " We wo n't take long , " Major Isley said . " I 've got a search team ready to go , " Bryce said . " We 've got to go through every building in this town , take a body count , find out how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some clue as to what the hell killed all these people . There 's several days of work ahead of us , especially since we ca n't continue with the search past sundown . I wo n't let my men go prowling around at night , when the power might go off at any second . Damned if I will . " Jenny thought of Wargle 's eaten face . The hollow eye sockets . Major Isley said , " Just a few questions . " Arkham switched on the tape recorder.  |p208Lisa  was staring hard at the major and at the captain . Jenny wondered what was on the girl 's mind . " We 'll start with you , Sheriff , " Major Isley said . " In the forty-eight hours prior to these events , did your office receive any reports of power failures or telephone service interruptions ? " " If there were problems of that nature , " Bryce said , " people would generally call the utility companies , not the sheriff . " " Yes , but would n't the utilities notify you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity ? " Bryce nodded . " Of course . And to the best of my knowledge , we did n't receive any such alerts . " Captain Arkham leaned forward . " What about difficulties with televisionand radio reception in this area ? " " Not that I 'm aware of , " Bryce said . " Any reports of unexplainable explosions ? " " Explosions ? " " Yes , " Isley said . " Explosions or sonic booms or any unusually loud and untraceable noises . " " No . Nothing like that . " Jenny wondered what in the devil they were driving at . Isley hesitated and said , " Any reports of unusual aircraft in the vicinity ? " " No . " Lisa said , " You guys are n't part of General Copperfield 's team , are you ? That 's why you do n't have names on your helmets . " Bryce said , " And your decontamination suits do n't fit as well as everyone else 's . Theirs are custom tailored . Yours are strictly off the rack . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't with the CBW project , " Jenny said , " what are you doing here ? " " We did n't want to bring it up at the start , " Isley said . " We thought we might get straighter answers from you if you were n't immediately aware of what we were looking for . " Arkham said , " We 're not Army Medical Corps . We 're Air Force . " " Project Skywatch , " Isley said . " We 're not exactly a secret organization , but . . . well . . . let 's just say we discourage publicity . " " Skywatch ? " Lisa said , brightening . " Are you talking about UFOs ? Isthat it ? Flying saucers ? " Jenny saw Isley wince at the words " flying saucers . " Isley said , " We do n't go around checking out every crackpot report of little green men from Mars . For one thing , we do n't have the funds to dop209that . Our job is planning for the scientific , social , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence . We 're really more of a think tank than anything else . " Bryce shook his head . " No one around here 's been reporting flying saucers . " " But that 's just what Major Isley means , " Arkham said . " You see , our studies indicate the first encounter might start out in such a bizarre way that we would n't even recognize it as a first encounter . The popular conceptof spaceships descending from the sky . . . well , it might not be like that . If we find ourselves dealing with truly alien intelligences , their ships might be so different from our concept of a ship that we would n't even be aware they 'd landed . " " Which is why we check into strange phenomena that do n't seem to be UFO related at first glance , " Arkham said . " Like last spring , up in Vermont , there was a house in which an extremely active poltergeist was at work . Furniture was levitated . Dishes flew across the kitchen and smashed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no water pipes . Balls of flame erupted out of empty air  --  " " Is n't a poltergeist supposed to be a ghost ? " Bryce asked . " What could ghosts have to do with your area of interest ? " " Nothing , " Isley said . " We do n't believe in ghosts . But we wondered if perhaps poltergeist phenomena might result from an attempt at **25;10720;TOOLONG gone awry . If we were to encounter an alien race that communicated only by telepathy , and if we were unable to receive those telepathic thoughts , maybe the unreceived psychic energy would produce destructive phenomena of the sort sometimes attributed to malign spirits . " " And what did you finally decide about the poltergeist up there in Vermont ? " Jenny asked . " Decide ? Nothing , " Isley said . " Just that it was . . . interesting , " Arkham said . Jenny glanced at Lisa and saw that the girl 's eyes were very wide . This was something Lisa could grasp , accept , and cling to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks to movies and books and television . Monsters from outer space . Invaders from other worlds . It did n't make the Snowfield killings any less gruesome . But it was a known threat , and that made it infinitely preferable to the unknown . Jenny strongly doubted this was mankind 's first encounter with creatures from the stars , but Lisa seemed eager to believe . " And what about Snowfield ? " the girl asked . " Is that what 's going on ? Has something landed from . . . out there ? "  |p210Arkham  looked uneasily at Major Isley . Isley cleared his throat : As translated by the squawk box on his chest , it was a racheting , machinelike sound . " It 's much too soon to make any judgment about that . We do believe there 's a small chance the first contact between man and alien might involve the danger of biological contamination . That 's why we 've got an information-sharing arrangement with Copperfield 's project . An inexplicable outbreak of an unknown disease might indicate an unrecognized contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an extraterrestrial creature we 're dealing with , " Bryce said , obviously doubtful , " it seems damned savage for a being of superior ' intelligence . " " The same thought occurred to me , " Jenny said . Isley raised his eyebrows . " There 's no guarantee that a creature with greater intelligence would be pacifistic and benevolent . " " Yeah , " Arkham said . " That 's a common conceit : the notion that aliens would 've learned how to live in complete harmony among themselves and with other species . As that old song says . . . it ai n't necessarily so . After all , mankind is considerably further along the road of evolution than gorillasare , but as a species we 're definitely more warlike than gorillas at their most aggressive . " " Maybe one day we will encounter a benevolent alien race that 'll teach us how to live in peace , " Isley said . " Maybe they 'll give us the knowledge and technology to solve all our earthly problems and even to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule out the alternative , " Arkham said grimly . Eleven o'clock Monday morning in Snowfield was seven o'clock Monday evening in London . A miserably wet day had flowed into a miserably wet night . Raindrops drummed on the window in the cubbyhole kitchen of Timothy Flyte 's tworoom , attic apartment . The professor was standing in front of a cutting board , making a sandwich.  |p211After  partaking of that magnificent champagne breakfast at Burt Sandler'sexpense , Timothy had n't felt up to lunch . He had forgone afternoon tea , as well . He 'd met with two students today . He was tutoring one of them in hieroglyphics analysis and the other in Latin . Surfeited with breakfast , he had nearly fallen asleep during both sessions . Embarrassing . But , as little as his pupils were paying him , they could hardly complain too strenuously if , just once , he dozed off in the middle of a lesson . As he put a thin slice of boiled ham and a slice of Swiss cheese on mustard-slathered bread , he heard the telephone ringing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think it was for him . He received few calls . But seconds later , there was a knock at the door . It was the young Indian fellow who rented a room on the first floor . In heavily accented English , he told Timothy the call was for him . And urgent . " Urgent ? Who is it ? " Timothy asked as he followed the young man down the stairs . " Did he give his name ? " " Sand-leer , " the Indian said . Sandler ? Burt Sandler ? Over breakfast , they had agreed on terms for a new edition of The Ancient Enemy , one that was completely rewritten to appeal to the average reader . Following the original publication of the book , almost seventeen years ago , he had received several offers to popularize his theories about historical mass disappearances , but he had resisted the idea ; he had felt that the issuance of a popularized version of The Ancient Enemy would be playing into the hands of all those who had so unfairly accused him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , years of want had made him more amenable to the idea . Sandler 's appearance on the scene and his offer of a contract had come at a time when Timothy 's ever-worsening poverty had reached a critical stage ; it was truly a miracle . This morning , they had settled on an advance ( against royalties ) of fifteen thousand dollars . At the current rate of exchange , that amounted to a little more than eight thousand pounds sterling . It was n't a fortune , but it was more money than Timothy had seen in a long , long time , and at the moment it seemed like wealth beyond counting . As he went down the narrow stairs , toward the front hall , where thetelephone stood on a small table beneath a cheap print of a bad painting , Timothy wondered if Sandler was calling to back out of the agreement . The professor 's heart began to pound with almost painful force . The young Indian gentleman said , " I hope is no trouble , sir . " Then he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the phone . " Hello ? "  | " My God , do you get an evening newspaper ? " Sandler asked . His voice was shrill , almost hysterical . Timothy wondered if Sandler was drunk . Was this what he considered urgent business ? Before Timothy could respond , Sandler said , " I think it 's happened ! By God , Dr. Flyte , I think it 's actually happened ! It 's in the newspaper tonight . And on the radio . Not many details yet . But it sure looks as if it 's happened . " The professor 's worry about the book contract was now compounded by exasperation . " Could you please be more specific , Mr. Sandler ? " " The ancient enemy , Dr. Flyte . One of those creatures has struck again . Just yesterday . A town in California . Some are dead . Most are missing . Hundreds . An entire town . Gone . " " God help them , " Flyte said . " I 've got a friend in the London office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest wire service reports , " Sandler said . " I know things that are n't in the papers yet . For one thing , the police out there in California have put out an all-points bulletin for you . Apparently , one of the victims had read your book . When the attack came , he locked himself in a bathroom . It got him anyway . But he gained enough time to scrawl your name and the title of your book on the mirror ! " Timothy was speechless . There was a chair beside the telephone . He suddenly needed it . " The authorities in California do n't understand what 's happened . They do n't even realize The Ancient Enemy is the title of a book , and they do n't know what part you play in all this . They think it was a nerve gas attack or an act of biological warfare or even extraterrestrial contact . But the man who wrote your name on that mirror knew better . And so do we . I 'll tell you more in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I hope you have a passport ! " " Uh . . . yes . " " I 'm coming by with a car to take you to the airport . I want you to go to California , Dr. Flyte . " " But  --  " " Tonight . There 's an available seat on a flight from Heathrow . I 've reserved it in your name . " " But I ca n't afford  --  " " Your publisher is paying all expenses . Do n't worry . You must go to Snowfield . You wo n't be writing just a popularization of The Ancient Enemy . Not any more . Now , you 're going to write a well-rounded humanp213story about Snowfield , and all of your material on historical mass disappearancesand your theories about the ancient enemy will be supportive of that narrative . Do you see ? Wo n't it be great ? " " But would it be right for me to rush in there now ? " " What do you mean ? " Sandler asked . " Would it be proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear as if I were attempting to cash in on a terrible tragedy ? " " Listen , Dr. Flyte , there are going to be a hundred hustlers in Snowfield , all with book contracts in their back pockets . They 'll rip off your material . If you do n't write the book on the subject , one of them will write it at your expense . " " But hundreds are dead , " Timothy said . He felt ill . " Hundreds . The pain , the tragedy ... " Sandler was clearly impatient with the professor 's hesitancy . " Well .. . okay , okay . Maybe you 're right . Maybe I have n't really stopped to think about the horror of it . But do n't you see  --  that 's why you must be the one to write the ultimate book on the subject . No one else can bring your erudition or compassion to the project . " " Well ... " Seizing on Timothy 's hesitation , Sandler said , " Good . Pack a suitcase fast . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and Timothy sat for a moment , holding the receiver , listening to the dead line . Stunned . In the taxi 's headlights , the rain was silvery . It slanted on the wind , like thousands of thin streamers of glittering Christmas tinsel . On the pavement , it puddled in quicksilver pools . The cabdriver was reckless . The car careened along the slick streets . With one hand , Timothy held tightly to the safety bar on the door . EvidentlyBurt Sandler had promised a very large tip as a reward for speed . Sitting next to the professor , Sandler said , " There 'll be a layover in New York , but not too long . One of our people will meet you and shepherd you through . We wo n't alert the media in New York . We 'll save the press conference for San Francisco . So be prepared to face an army of eager reporters when you get off the plane there . " " Could n't I just go quietly to Santa Mira and present myself to the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no ! " Sandler said , clearly horrified by the very thought . " We 've got to have a press conference . You 're the only one with the answer , Dr. Flyte . We 've got to let everyone know that you 're the one.  |p214We  've got to start beating the drum for your next book before Norman Mailer puts aside his latest study of Marilyn Monroe and jumps into this thing with both feet ! " " I have n't even begun to write that book yet . " " God , I know . And by the time we publish , the demand will be phenomenal ! " The cab turned a corner . Tires squealed . Timothy was thrown against the door . " A publicist will meet you at the plane in San Francisco . He 'll guide you through the press conference , " Sandler said . " One way or another he 'll get you to Santa Mira . It 's a fairly long drive , so maybe it can be done by helicopter . " " Helicopter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep puddle , casting up plumes of silvery water . The airport was within sight . Burt Sandler had been talking nonstop since Timothy had gotten into the cab . Now he said , " One more thing . At your press conference , tell them the stories you told me this morning . About the disappearing Mayans . And three thousand Chinese infantrymen who vanished . And be sure to make any references you possibly can to mass disappearances that took place in the U.S.  --  even before there was a United States , even in previous geologicaleras . That 'll appeal to the Americ , In press . Local ties . That always helps . Did n't the first British colony in A ierica vanish without a trace ? " " Yes . The Roanoke Island colony . " " Be sure to mention it . " " But I ca n't say conclusively that the disappearance of the Roanoke colony is connected with the ancient enemy . " " Is there any chance whatsoever that it might 've been ? " Fascinated , as always , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , to wrench his mind away from the suicidal behavior of the cabdriver . " When a British expedition , funded by Sir Walter Raleigh , returned to the Roanoke colony in March of 1590 , they found everyone gone . One hundred and twenty people had vanished without a trace . Countless theories have been advanced regarding their fate . For example , the most popular theory holds that the people at Roanoke Island fell victim to the Croatoan Indians , who lived nearby . The only message left by the colonists was the name of that tribe , hastily slashed into the bark of a tree . But the Croatoansprofessed to know nothing about the disappearance . And they were peaceful Indians . Not the least bit warlike . Indeed , they had initiallyp215helped the colonists settle in . Furthermore , there were no signs of violence at the settlement . No bodies were ever found . No bones . No graves . So you see , even the most widely accepted theory raises a greater number of questions than it answers . " The taxi swept around another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now Timothy was only passingly aware of the driver 's daredevil conduct . He continued : " It occurred to me that the word the colonists had carved into that tree  --  Croatoan  --  might not have been intended to point an accusing finger . It might have meant that the Croatoans would know what had happened . I read the journals of several British explorers who later talked with the Croatoans about the colony 's disappearance , and there 's evidence the Indians did , indeed , have some idea of what had happened . Or thought they knew . But they were not taken seriously when they tried to explain to the white man . The Croatoans reported that , simultaneously with the disappearanceof the colonists , there was a great depletion of game in the forests and fields in which the tribe hunted . Virtually all species of wildlife had abruptly dwindled drastically in numbers . A couple of the more perceptiveexplorers noted in their journals that the Indians regarded the subject with superstitious dread . They seemed to have a religious explanation for the disappearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the missing colonists were not interested in Indian superstitionsand did not pursue that avenue of enquiry . " " I gather you 've researched Croatoan religious beliefs , " Burt Sandler said . " Yes , " Timothy said . " Not an easy subject , for the tribe has been extinct itself for many , many years . What I 've found is that the Croatoans were spiritualists . They believed that the spirit endured and walked the earth even after the death of the body , and they believed there were greater spirits ' that manifested themselves in the elements  --  wind , earth , fire , water , and so forth . Most important of all  --  as far as we 're concerned  --  they also believed in an evil spirit , a source of all evil , an equivalent to the Christians ' Satan . I forget the exact Indian word for it , but it translates roughly as He Who Can Be Anything Yet Is Nothing . " " My God , " Sandler said . " That 's not a bad description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in superstitions . The Croatoans believed that both the wildlife and the colonists had been taken away by He Who Can Be Anything Yet Is Nothing . So ... while I can not say conclusively that the ancient enemy had something to do with the disap/pearance of the Roanoke Islanders , it seems to me sufficient reason to consider the possibility . " " Fantastic ! " Sandler said . " Tell them all of that at the press conference in San Francisco . Just the way you 've told me . " The taxi squealed to a stop in front of the terminal . Burt Sandler shoved a few five-pound notes into the driver 's hand . He glanced at his watch . " Dr. Flyte , let 's get you on that plane . " * * *From his window seat , Timothy Flyte watched the city lights disappearingbeneath the storm clouds . The jet speared upward through the thin rain . Soon , they rose above the overcast ; the storm was below them , clear sky overhead . The rays of the moon bounced off the churning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane was filled with soft , eerie light . The seatbelt sign winked off . He unbuckled but could n't relax . His mind was churning just as the storm clouds were . The stewardess came around , offering drinks . He asked for Scotch . He felt like a coiled spring . Overnight , his life had changed . There had been more excitement in this one day than in the entire past year . The tension that gripped him was not unpleasant . He was more than happy to slough off his dreary existence ; he was putting on a new and better life as quickly as he might have put on a new suit of clothes . He was risking ridicule and all the old familiar accusations by going public with his theories again . But there was also a chance that he would at last be able to prove himself . The Scotch came , and he drank it . He ordered another . Slowly , he relaxed . Beyond the plane , the night was vast . From the barred window of the temporary holding cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All morning he watched the reporters congregating . Something really big had happened.  |p217Some  of the other inmates were sharing news cell to cell , but none of them would share anything with Kale . They hated him . Frequently , they taunted him , called him a baby killer . Even in jail , there were social classes , and no one was farther down the ladder than child killers . It was almost funny . Even car thieves , muggers , burglars , holdup men , and embezzlers needed to feel morally superior to someone . So they reviledand persecuted anyone who had harmed a child , and somehow that made them feel like priests and bishops by comparison . Fools . Kale despised them . He did n't ask anyone to share information with him . He would n't give them the satisfaction of freezing him out . He stretched out on his bunk and daydreamed about his magnificent destiny : fame , power , wealth .. . At eleven-thirty , he was still lying on his bunk when they came to take him to the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard unlocked the door . Another man  --  a gray-haired , potbellieddeputy  --  came in and put handcuffs on Kale . " We 're shorthanded today , " he told Kale . " I 'm the only one detailed for this . But do n't you get some damn-fool idea that you 'd have a chance to make a break for it . You 're cuffed , and I 've got the gun , and nothing would please me as much as shooting your ass off . " In both the guard 's and the deputy 's eyes , there was loathing . At last , the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison became real to Kale . To his surprise , he began to cry as they led him out of the cell . The other prisoners hooted and laughed and called him names . The potbellied man prodded Kale in the ribs . " Get a move on . " Kale stumbled along the corridor on weak legs , through a security gate that rolled open for them , out of the cellblock , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy prodded Kale toward the elevators , proddedhim too often and too hard , even when it was n't necessary . Kale felt his self-pity giving way to anger . In the small , slowly descending elevator , he realized that the deputy no longer saw any threat in his prisoner . He was disgusted , impatient , embarrassed by Kale 's emotional collapse . By the time the doors opened , a change had occurred in Kale , as well . He was still weeping quietly , but the tears were no longer genuine , and he was shaking with excitement rather than with despair . They went through another checkpoint . The deputy presented a set of papers to another guard who called him Joe . The guard looked at Kale with unconcealed disdain . Kale averted his face as if he were ashamed of himself . And continued to cry.  |p218Then  he and Joe were outside , crossing a large parking lot toward a row of green and white police cruisers that were lined up in front of a cyclone fence . The day was warm and sunny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rubbery . He kept his shoulders hunched and his head low . He shuffled along listlessly , as if he were a broken , beaten man . Except for him and the deputy , the parking lot was deserted . Just the two of them . Perfect . All the way to the car , Kale looked for the right moment in which to make his move . For a while he thought it would n't come . Then Joe shoved him against a car and half-turned away to unlock the door  --  and Kale struck . He threw himself at the deputy as the man bent to insert a key into the lock . The deputy gasped and swung a fist at him . Too late . Kale ducked under the blow and came up fast and slammed him against the car , pinning him . Joe 's face went white with pain as the door handle rammed hard against the base of his spine . The ring of keys flew out of his hand , and even as they were falling , he was using the same hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own hands cuffed , he could n't wrestle the gun away . As soon as the revolver was drawn , the fight was finished . So Kale went for the other man 's throat . Went for it with his teeth . He bit deep , felt blood gushing , bit again , pushed his mouth into the wound , like an attack dog , and bit again , and the deputy screamed , but it was only a yelp-rattle-sigh that no one could have heard , and the gun fell out of the holster and out of the deputy 's spasming hand , and both men went down hard , with Kale on top , and the deputy tried to scream again , so Kale rammed a knee into his crotch , and blood was pump-pump-pumping out of the man 's throat . " Bastard , " Kale said . The deputy 's eyes froze . The blood stopped spurting from the wound . It was over . Kale had never felt so powerful , so alive . He looked around the parking lot . Still no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried them one by one until he unlockedhis handcuffs . He threw the cuffs under the car . He rolled the dead deputy under the cruiser , too , out of sight . He wiped his face on his sleeve . His shirt was spotted and stained with blood . There was nothing he could do about that . Nor could he change the fact that he was wearing baggy , blue , coarsely woven institutional clothing and a pair of canvas and rubber slip-on shoes . Feeling conspicuous , he hurried along the fence , through the open gate.  |p219He  crossed the alley and went into another parking lot behind a large , twostoryapartment complex . He glanced up at all the windows and hoped no one was looking . There were perhaps twenty cars in the lot . A yellow Datsun had keys in the ignition . He got behind the wheel , closed the door , and sighed with relief . He was out of sight , and he had transportation . A box of Kleenex stood on the console . Using paper tissues and spit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at himself in the rearview mirror  --  and grinned . While General Copperfield 's unit was conducting the autopsy and tests in the mobile field lab , Bryce Hammond formed two search teams and began a building-by-building inspection of the town . Frank Autry led the first group , and Major Isley went along as an observer for Project Skywatch . Likewise , Captain Arkham joined Bryce 's group . Block by block and street by street , the two teams were never more than one building apart , remaining in close touch with walkie-talkies . Jenny accompanied Bryce . More than anyone else , she was familiar with Snowfield 's residents , and she was the one most likely to identify any bodies that were found . In most cases , she could also tell them who had lived in each house and how many people had been in each family  --  information they needed to compile a list of the missing . She was troubled about exposing Lisa to more gruesome scenes , but she could n't refuse to assist the search team . She could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not after what had happened to Harker . And to Velazquez . But the girl coped well with the tension of the house-tohousesearch . She was still proving herself to Jenny , and Jenny was increasinglyproud of her . They did n't find any bodies for a while . The first businesses and houses they entered were deserted . In several houses , tables were set for Sunday dinner . In others , tubs were filled with bathwater that had grown cold . In ap220number of places , television sets were still playing , but there was no one to watch them . In one kitchen they discovered Sunday dinner on the electric stove . The rood in the three pots had cooked for so many hours that all of the water content had evaporated . The remains were dry , hard , burnt , blistered , and unidentifiable . The stainless-steel pots were ruined ; they had turned bluish-black both inside and out . The plastic handles of the pots had softenedand partially melted . The entire house reeked with the most acrid , nauseating stench Jenny had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a miracle the whole place was n't set on fire . " " It probably would 've been if that were a gas stove , " Jenny said . Above the three pots , there was a stainless-steel range hood with an exhaust fan . When the food had burned , the hood had contained the shortlivedflash of flames and had prevented the fire from spreading to the surrounding cabinetry . Outside again , everyone ( except Major Arkham in his decontamination suit ) took deep breaths of the clean mountain air . They needed a couple of minutes to purge their lungs of the vile stuff they had breathed inside that house . Then , next door , they found the first body of the day . It was John Farley , who owned the Mountain Tavern , which was open only during the ski season . He was in his forties . He had been a striking man , with salt-andpepperhair , a large nose , and a wide mouth that had frequently curved into an immensely engaging smile . Now he was bloated and bruised , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the seams as his body swelled . Farley was sitting at the breakfast table , at one end of his big kitchen . On a plate before him was a meal of cheese-filled ravioli and meatballs . There was also a glass of red wine . On the table , beside the plate , there was an open magazine . Farley was sitting up straight in his chair . One hand lay palm-up in his lap . His other arm was on the table , and in that hand was clenched a crust of bread . Farley 's mouth was partly open , and there was a bite of bread trapped between his teeth . He had perished in the act of chewing ; his jaw muscles had never even relaxed . " Good God , " Tal said , " he did n't have time to spit the stuff out or swallow it . Death must 've been instantaneous . " " And he did n't see it coming , either , " Bryce said . " Look at his face . There 's no expression of horror or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . " Staring at the dead man 's clenched jaws , Jenny said , " What I don'tp221understand is why death does n't bring any relaxation of the muscles whatsoever . It 's weird . " In Our Lady of the Mountains Church , sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows , which were composed predominantly of blues and greens . Hundreds of irregularly shaped patches of royal blue , sky blue , turquoise , aquamarine , emerald green , and many other shades dripped across the polished wooden pews , puddled in the aisles , and shimmered on the walls . It 's like being underwater , Gordy Brogan thought as he followed Frank Autry into the strangely and beautifully illuminated nave . Just beyond the narthex , a stream of crimson light splashed across the white marble font that contained the holy water . It was the crimson of Christ 's blood . The sun pierced a stained-glass image of Christ 's bleeding heart and sprayed sanguineous rays upon the water that glistened in the pale marble bowl . Of the five men in the search team , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy water , crossed himself , and genuflected . The church was solemn , silent , still . The air was softened by a pleasant trace of incense . In the pews , there were no worshipers . At first it appeared as if the church was deserted . Then Gordy looked more closely at the altar and gasped . Frank saw it , too . " Oh , my God . " The chancel was cloaked in more shadows than was the rest of the church , which was why the men had n't immediately noticed the hideous  --  and sacrilegious  --  thing above the altar . The altar candles had burned down all the way and had gone out . However , as the men in the search team progressed hesitantly down the center aisle , they got a clearer and clearer view of the life-size crucifix that rose up from the center of the altar , along the rear wall of the chancel . It was a wooden cross , with an exquisitely detailed , hand-painted , glazed plaster figure of Christ fixed to it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another body that hung in front of it . A real body , not another plaster corpus . It was the priest in his robes ; he was nailed to the cross . Two altarboys knelt on the floor in front of the altar . They were dead , bruised , bloated . The flesh of the priest had begun to darken and to show other signs of imminent decomposition . His body was not in the same bizarre conditionp222as all the others that had been found thus far . In his case , the discolorat it In was what you would expect of a day-old corpse . Frank Autry , Major Isley , and the other two deputies continued through the gate in the altar railing and stepped up into the chancel . Gordy was n't able to go with them . He was too badly shaken and had to sit in the front pew to keep from collapsing . After inspecting the chancel and glancing through the sacristy door , Frank used his walkie-talkie to call Bryce Hammond in the building next door . " Sheriff , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc Paige for positive IDs . But it 's especially grisly , so better leave Lisa in the vestibulewith a couple of the guys . " " We 'll be there in two minutes , " the sheriff said . Frank came down from the chancel , through the gate in the railing , and sat down beside Gordy . He was holding the walkie-talkie in one hand and a gun in the other . " You 're a Catholic . " " Yeah . " " Sorry you had to see this . " " I 'll be okay , " Gordy said . " It 's no easier for you just because you 're not a Catholic . " " You know the priest ? " " I think his name 's Father Callahan . I did n't go to this church , though . I attended St. Andrew 's , down in Santa Mira . " Frank put the walkie-talkie down and scratched his chin . " From all the other indications we 've had , it 's looked like the attack came yesterday evening , not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now this . . . If these three died in the morning , during Mass  --  " " It was probably during Benediction , " Gordy said . " Not Mass . " " Benediction ? " " The Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament . The Sunday evening service . " " Ah . Then it fits right in with the timing of the others . " He looked around at the empty pews . " What happened to the parishioners ? Why are only the altarboys and the priest here ? " " Well , not an awful lot of people come to Benediction , " Gordy said . " There were probably at least two or three others . But it took them . " " Why did n't it just take everyone ? " Gordy did n't answer . " Why did it have to do something like this ? " Frank pressed . " To ridicule us . To mock us . To steal our hope , " Gordy said miserably . Frank stared at him . Gordy said , " Maybe some of us have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably most of us have . I know I 've sure been prayingp223a lot since we came here . Probably you have , too . It knew we would do that . It knew we would ask God for help . So this is its way of letting us know that God ca n't help us . Or at least that 's what it would like us to believe . Because that 's its way . To instill doubt about God . That 's always been its way . " Frank said , " You sound as if you know exactly what we 're up against re . " Maybe , " Gordy said . He stared at the crucified priest , then turned to ank again . " Do n't you know ? Do n't you really , Frank ? " * * *After they left the church and went around the corner onto the cross street , they found two wrecked cars . A Cadillac Seville had run across the front lawn of the church rectory , mowing down the shrubbery in its path , and had collided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The post was nearly splintered in two . The porch roof was sagging . Tal Whitman squinted through the side window of the Caddy . " There 's a woman behind the wheel . " " Dead ? " Bryce asked . " Yeah . But not from the accident . " At the other side of the car , Jenny tried to open the driver 's door . It was locked . All of the doors were locked , and all of the windows were rolled up tight . Nevertheless , the woman behind the wheel  --  Edna Gower ; Jenny knew her  --  was like the other corpses . Darkly bruised . Swollen . A scream of terror frozen on her twisted face . " How could it get in there and kill her ? " Tal wondered aloud . " Remember the locked bathroom at the Candleglow Inn , " Bryce said . " And the barricaded room at the Oxleys ' , " Jenny said . Captain Arkham said , " It 's almost an argument for the general 's nerve gas theory . " Then Arkham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully examined the car . But it was n't radiation that had killed the woman inside . The second car , half a block away , was a pearl-white Lynx . On the , pavement behind it were black skid marks . The Lynx was angled across the street , blocking it . The front end was punched into the side of a yellow Chevy van . There was n't a lot of damage because the Lynx had almost braked to a stop before hitting the parked vehicle . The driver was a middle-aged man with a bushy mustache . He was wearing cut-off jeans and a Dodgers T-shirt . Jenny knew him , too . Martyp224Sussman . He had been Snowfield 's city manager for the past six years . Affable , earnest Marty Sussman . Dead . Again , the cause of death was clearly not related to the collision . The doors of the Lynx were locked . The windows were rolled up tight , just as they had been on the Cadillac . " Looks like they both were trying to escape from something , " Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or they might just have been out for a drive or going somewhere on an errand when the attack came . If they were trying to escape , something sure stopped them cold , forced them right off the street . " " Sunday was a warm day . Warm but not too warm , " Bryce said . " Not hot enough to ride around with the windows closed and the air conditioner on . It was the kind of day when most people keep the windows down , taking advantage of the fresh air . So it looks to me as if , after they were forced to stop , they put up the windows and locked themselves in , trying to keep something out . " " But it got them anyway , " Jenny said . It . Ned and Sue Marie Bischoff owned a lovely Tudor-style home set on a double lot , nestled among huge pine trees . They lived there with their two boys . Eight-year-old Lee Bischoff could already play the piano surprisingly well , in spite of the smallness of his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Stevie Wonder " only not blind . " Six-year-old Terry looked exactly like a black-skinned Dennis the Menace , but he had a sweet temper . Ned was a successful artist . His oil paintings sold for as much as six and seven thousand dollars , and his limited edition prints went for four or five hundred dollars apiece . He was a patient of Jenny 's . Although he was only thirty-two and was already a success in life , she had treated him for an ulcer . The ulcer would n't be bothering him any more . He was in his studio , lying on the floor in front of an easel , dead . Sue Marie was in the kitchen . Like Hilda Beck , Jenny 's housekeeper , and like many other people all over town , Sue Marie had died while preparing dinner . She had been a pretty woman . Not any more . They found the two boys in one of the bedrooms . It was a wonderful room for kids , large and airy , with bunk beds . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were paintingsthat Ned had done just for his kids , whimsical fantasy scenes quitep225unlike the pieces for which he was well known : a pig in a tuxedo , dancing with a cow in an evening gown ; the interior of a spaceship command chamber , where all the astronauts were toads ; an eerie yet charming scene of a school playground at night , bathed in the light of a full moon , no kids around , but with a huge and monstrous-looking werewolf having a grand and giddy time on a set of swings . The boys were in one corner , beyond an array of overturned Tonka Toys . The younger boy , Terry , was behind Lee , who seemed to have made a valiant effort to protect his smaller brother . The boys were staring out into the room , eyes bulging , their dead gazes still fixed upon whatever had threatened them yesterday . Lee 's muscles had locked , so that his thin arms were in the same position now as they had been in the last seconds of his life : raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if warding off blows . Bryce knelt in front of the kids . He put one trembling hand against Lee 's face , as if unwilling to believe that the child was actually dead . Jenny knelt beside him . " Those are the Bischoffs ' two boys , " she said , unable to keep her voice from breaking . " So now the whole family 's accounted for . " Tears were streaming down Bryce 's face . Jenny tried to remember how old his own son was . Seven or eight ? About the same age as Lee Bischoff . Little Timmy Hammond was lying in the hospital in Santa Mira this very minute , comatose , just as he had been for the past year . He was pretty much a vegetable . Yes , but even that was better than this . Anything was better than this . Eventually , Bryce 's tears dried up . There was rage in him now . " I 'll get them for this , " he said . " Whoever did this . . . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man quite like him . He had considerable masculinestrength and purpose , but he was also capable of tenderness . She wanted to hold him . And be held . But , as always , she was far too guarded about expressing her own emotionalstate . If she had possessed his openness , she would never have become estranged from her mother . But she was n't that way , not yet , although she wanted to be . So , in response to his vow to get the killers of the Bischoffs ' children , she said , " But what if it is n't anything human that killed them ? Not all evil is in men . There 's evil in nature . The blind maliciousness of earthquakes . The uncaring evil of cancer . This thing here could be like that  --  remote and unaccountable . There 'll be no taking it to court if it is n't even human . What then ? " " Whoever or whatever the hell it is , I 'll get it . I 'll stop it . I 'll make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said stubbornly.  |p226Frank  Autry 's search team prowled through three deserted houses after leaving the Catholic church . The fourth house was n't empty . They found Wendell Hulbertson , a high school teacher who worked in Santa Mira but who chose to live here in the mountains , in a house that had once belonged to his mother . Gordy had been in Hulbertson 's English class only five years ago . The teacher was not swollen or bruised like the other corpses ; he had taken his own life . Backed into a corner of his bedroom , he had put the barrel of a .32 automatic in his mouth and had pulled the trigger . Evidently , death by his own hand had been preferable to whatever it had been about to do to him . After leaving the Bischoff residence , Bryce led his group through a few houses without finding any bodies . Then , in the fifth house , they discoveredan elderly husband and wife locked in a bathroom , where they had tried to hide from their killer . She was sprawled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were patients of mine , " Jenny said . " Nick and Melina Papan-drakis . " Tal wrote their names down on a list of the dead . Like Harold Ordnay and his wife in the Candleglow Inn , Nick Papandrakishad attempted to leave a message that would point a finger at the killer . He had taken some iodine from the medicine cabinet and had used it to paint on the wall . He had n't had a chance to finish even one word . There were only two letters and part of a third : PRA " Can anyone figure out what he intended to write ? " Bryce asked . They all took turns squeezing into the bathroom and stepping over Nick Papandrakis 's corpse to have a look at the orange-brown letters on the wall , but none of them had any flashes of inspiration . Bullets . In the house next to the Papandrakis 's , the kitchen floor was litteredp227with expended bullets . Not entire cartridges . Just dozens of lead slugs , sans their brass casings . The fact that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunfire had taken place here . There was no odor of gunpowder . No bullet holes in the walls or cabinets . There were just bullets all over the floor , as if they had rained magically out of thin air . Frank Autry scooped up a handful of the gray lumps of metal . He was n't a ballistics expert , but , oddly , none of the bullets was fragmented or badly deformed , and that enabled him to see that they had come from a variety of weapons . Most of them  --  scores of them  --  appeared to be the type and caliber of ammunition that was spat out by the submachine guns with which General Copperfield 's support troops were armed . Are these slugs from Sergeant Harker 's gun ? Frank wondered . Are these the rounds Harker fired at his killer in the meat locker at Gilmartin 's Market ? He frowned , perplexed . He dropped the bullets , and they clattered on the floor . He plucked several other slugs off the tiles . There were a .22 and a .32 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of shotgun pellets . He picked up a single .45-caliber bullet and examined it with specialinterest . It was exactly the ammunition that his own revolver handled . Gordy Brogan hunkered down beside him . Frank did n't look at Gordy . He continued to stare intently at the slug . He was wrestling with an eerie thought . Gordy scooped a few bullets off the kitchen tiles . " They are n't deformed at all . " Frank nodded . " They had to 've hit something , " Gordy said . " So they should be deformed . Some of them should be , anyway . " He paused , then said , " Hey , you 're a million miles away . What 're you thinking about ? " " Paul Henderson . " Frank held the .45 slug in front of Gordy 's face . " Paul fired three like this last night , over at the substation . " " At his killer . " " Yeah . " " So ? " " So I have this crazy hunch that if we asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it came from Paul 's revolver . " Gordy blinked at him . " And , " Frank said , " I also think that if we searched through all of the slugs on the floor here , we 'd find exactly two more like this one . Not justp228one more , mind you . And not three more . Just two more with precisely the same markings as this one . " " You mean . . . the same three Paul fired last night . " " Yeah . " " But how 'd they get from there to here ? " Frank did n't answer . Instead , he stood and thumbed the send button on the walkie-talkie . " Sheriff ? " Bryce Hammond 's voice issued crisply from the small speaker . " What is it , Frank ? " " We 're still here at the Sheffield house . I think you 'd better come over . There 's something you ought to see . " " More bodies ? " " No , sir . Uh . . . something sort of weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff said . Then , to Gordy , Frank said , " What I think is . . . sometime within the past couple of hours , sometime after Sergeant Harker was taken from Gilmartin 's Market , it was here , right in this room . It got rid of all the bullets it 'd taken last night and this morning . " " The hits it took ? " " Yes . " " Got rid of them ? Just like that ? " " Just like that , " Frank said . " But how ? " " Looks like it just sort of . . . expelled them . Looks like it shed those bullets the way a dog shakes off loose hairs . " Driving through Santa Mira in the stolen Datsun , Fletcher Kale heard about Snowfield on the radio . Although it had captured the rest of the country 's attention , Kale was n't very interested . He was never particularly concerned about other people 's tragedies . He reached out to switch off the radio , already weary of hearing aboutp229Snowfield when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he caught a name that did mean something to him . Jake Johnson . Johnson was one of the deputies who had gone up to Snowfield last night . Now he was missing and might even be dead . Jake Johnson .. . A year ago , Kale had sold Johnson a solidly built log cabin on five acres in the mountains . Johnson had professed to be an avid hunter and had pretended to want the cabin for that purpose . However , from a number of things the deputy let slip , Kale decided that Johnson was actually a survivalist , one of those doomsayers who believed the world was rushing toward Armageddon and that society was going to collapse either because of runaway inflation or nuclear war or some other catastrophe . Kale became increasingly convinced that Johnson wanted the cabin for a hiding place that could be stocked with food and ammunition  --  and then easily defended in times of social upheaval . The cabin was certainly remote enough for that purpose . It was on Snowtop Mountain , all the way around the other side from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you had to go up a county fire road , a narrow dirt track that was passable virtually only to a four-wheel-drive vehicle , then switch to another , even tougher track . The final quarter-mile had to be covered on foot . Two months after Johnson purchased the mountain property , Kale sneaked up there on a warm June morning when he knew the deputy was on duty in Santa Mira . He wanted to see if Johnson was turning the place into a wilderness fortress , as he suspected . He found the cabin untouched , but he discovered that Johnson was doing extensive work in some of the limestone caves to which there was an entrance on his land . Outside the caves , there were sacks of cement and sand , a wheelbarrow , and a pile of stones . Just inside the mouth of the first cave , there had been two Coleman gas lanterns standing on the stone floor , by the wall . Kale had picked up one of the lanterns and had gone deeper into the subterranean chambers . The first cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of it , he followed a series of doglegs , twisting through irregular limestone antechambers , before he came into the first roomlike cave . Stacked against one wall were cases of five-pound , vacuum-sealed cans of nitrogen-preserved milk powder , freeze-dried fruits and vegetables , freeze-dried soup , powdered eggs , cans of honey , drums of whole grain . An air mattress . And much more . Jake had been busy.
