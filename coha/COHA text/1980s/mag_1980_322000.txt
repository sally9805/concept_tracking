Anderson does well , but the week 's real winner may be Ford <P> First it was Iowa , then New Hampshire , and last week it was Massachusetts that managed to scramble the 1980 presidential race . Every one of the early heats seems to produce its surprises , thrusting up a new star and creating new possibilities . That emphatically was the case in last week 's voting , which shaded or changed the fortunes of the whole cast of characters from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan , produced headlines for G.O.P. Congressman John Anderson , hitherto only a beguiling also-ran , and most important , pushed Gerald Ford to the edge of joining the race . <P> For a moment , the essence of the rapidly shifting race was caught in a quiet office in the U.S. Senate where a casualty of the Massachusetts vote was talking about why he had just dropped out of the Republican race . Senator Howard Baker wondered aloud about the volatility of the electorate in this political season , and then shrugged . Said he : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " <P> Nor , it would seem , does anyone else . Given the right combination of events and a little bit of luck , any number of pairings is still conceivable . To be sure , President Carter remained the heavy betting choice among the Democrats , but in Massachusetts Ted Kennedy defeated him by 65% to 29%-a wider margin than the Senator had expected in his native state . That victory was dimmed by his 3-to-l loss to Carter in neighboring Vermont in a " beauty contest " primary that left the actual selection of delegates to party caucuses . Nonetheless , Kennedy 's sagging candidacy was buoyed in another way when the President unexpectedly handed him a powerful campaign issue : the Administration 's abysmal handling of the U.N . resolution on Israel . <P> For all the encouragement that Massachusetts gave Kennedy , the state may have changed the Republican race far more dramatically . On the surface , Reagan had good reason to be satisfied by the tally , finishing a respectable third in a state that was alien territory . He thanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splendid present for their 28th wedding anniversary , which fell on the day that voters cast their ballots . On Saturday , Reagan got an even more glittering prize when he soundly defeated Connally in the South Carolina primary . With most of the ballots counted , Reagan was winning nearly 55% of the votes , vs. roughly 30% for Connally and some 15% for George Bush .
