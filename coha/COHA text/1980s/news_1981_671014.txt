THE Rev. Lyman Beecher ' s blacksmith great-grandfather could hold a 250-pound cider barrel in the air and drink from the bung hole . His blacksmith grandfather could lift the barrel onto a wagon . His blacksmith father could haul one down to the cellar . One kind of energy was seeping out of the family , but another was seeping in. // When the father wasn ' t making prime-quality hoes at his smithy , he was reading and disputing with the Yale students whom he took in as boarders to sharpen his mind on . And Lyman Beecher , for 50 years , was one of America ' s most renowned hellfire preachers . His seven sons all became ministers , chief among them the renowned , mellifluous and sometimes scandalous Henry Ward Beecher . His daughters included Catharine Beecher , a pioneer in women ' s education ; Isabella Hooker , a campaigner for women ' s rights , and Harriet Beecher Stowe . <> <> More Brains // " Lyman Beecher was the father of more brains than anyone in America , " Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unpredictable vitality that burst out in odd directions and disappeared in black , sometimes suicidal depressions . And so was a fair measure of that peculiarly American insistence on inventing the world from scratch ; an insistence that flowered through the 19th century and marked it . The Beecher family spanned the century massively : Lyman took his first ministry in 1800 ; Isabella , his youngest daughter , flamed out in 1907. // " The Beechers , " Milton Rugoff ' s spirited and immensely beguiling book , takes a joyful bite at the 19th century while telling about an extraordinary family . There were always Beechers around to scold the century and exhort it ; they were perennially public figures who dropped in at the White House as a matter of course . " The little lady who made this big war " was Abraham Lincoln ' s greeting to Harriet , whose " Uncle Tom ' s Cabin " was a political as well as a publishing phenomenon . For their part , the Beechers had their doubts about Lincoln . They found him slippery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their moral certitude was a swart , untidy man who told jokes. // The nature of the certitude varied from Lyman to his children and among the children themselves , but most of them shared his qualities of urgency and unstoppability . Whatever they did , they did with outsize vigor and very little sense of limits. // Lyman arrived at Yale in 1794 just as an era of enlightenment - rationalism , skepticism , French ideas and wine - was about to be submerged by Timothy Dwight and the last great wave of Puritan Calvinism . Lyman became Dwight ' s fervent disciple , preaching man ' s corrupt state , the futility of good deeds and the impossibility of being saved without divine intervention , the sign of which was a convulsive and noisy spiritual battle . Despite this , he paid his tuition by purveying wine and cigars to his fellow students. // There was a practical side to these Beechers , and Mr. Rugoff manages to convince us that there was more to it than Tartuffism . Lyman Beecher grilled his fiancee to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of this trial by Calvinist fire came not with a question as to how much she loved him , " Mr. Rugoff writes , " but whether she was prepared to rejoice should God damn her for His own honor and glory . " When his eldest daughter ' s fiance was drowned at sea , he felt it his duty to warn her that the young man would probably go to Hell. // Yet he was the most loving of fathers ; a man of considerable wit , boundless cheerfulness and inveterate optimism about his mission of spreading the gospel of salvation by gloom . " The two Miss Candys have false hopes which I am now going over to destroy if I can , " he writes . At the age of 57 , when he was pastor of Boston ' s Park Street Church and at the height of his fame , he gave it all up to take six children and his second wife out to Cincinnati . On their way they sang hymns and hurled tracts out of the stagecoach windows . He was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier. // It was a different climate out there . The great struggle between slave staters and free staters was being fought ; political , economic and social issues were in the air , and there was more fire in preaching abolition than salvation . Lyman Beecher ' s Cincinnati seminary was taken over - anticipatory shades of the 1960 ' s - by students whose ideas on damnation were less concerned with divine justice than with human slave holding. // It was Lyman ' s children who found a place for themselves in a new society where the social gospel was replacing the Calvinist gospel . Harriet wrote her book and campaigned tirelessly for abolition . Henry Ward Beecher , back at Plymouth Congregational in Brooklyn , organized gun running to the Kansas free staters .

" <> <> Fondling Jewels // Mr. Rugoff ' s accounts of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher are full length and fascinating , though he does analyze Harriet ' s writing in more detail than most of us may really want . Henry , with his all-but-innocent self-indulgence - he liked to fondle jewels as he preached - is an oddly touching figure in the midst of his scandals ( he was accused of seducing the wife of a parishioner ) . // But the life of the book is the chronicling of dozens of Beechers and their friends and connections . There is Henry ' s father-in-law , who threw hot soup on bare-shouldered female guests , arguing that they must be cold . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar who supported her in her travels and struggles . There is the most authentically Christian , though eccentric brother , Thomas . Mr. Rugoff gives us a clan of witnesses to the only full century - and such an odd and distant one already - of American life. //
