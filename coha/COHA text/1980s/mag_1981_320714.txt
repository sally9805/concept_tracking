Boom in the gloom-and-doom business of investment seminars They are the rock concerts of the 1980s . <P> " Woodstocks for rich people , " one promoter calls them . But instead of long-haired musicians , the stars of these extravaganzas are investment counselors , who generally hurl around wildly pessimistic prophecies about the future of the economy . Best-selling Author Douglas R. <P> Casey ( Crisis Investing : Opportunities and Profits in the Coming Great Depression ) last month told an Orlando , Fla. , gathering of 2,100 : " We are facing the greatest depression in the history of the world . " And Howard J. <P> Ruff ( How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years ) predicted the destruction of the dollar : " We will look back on 20% inflation with nostalgia . " Investment seminars have become regular events at vacation spots in Florida and California . This weekend some 1,600 people are expected to pay up to $445 each for a five-day marathon at Miami Beach 's Fontainebleau Hilton . <P> They will hear an all-star lineup that includes Ruff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Television Host Louis Rukeyser . Like rock concerts , the seminars can be phenomenally profitable for both the stars and the promoters . The impresario behind this weekend 's gala is Charles E. Githler III , 24 , who dropped out of college in 1976 to devote his full time to real estate speculation in Florida . Githler organized his first International Investors Forum in San Francisco three years ago , attracting 1,400 people at $450 each . The superstar of seminar promoters is James U. Blanchard III , 37 . He organized his first seminar in 1974 to help drum up support for his personal campaign to legalize investment in gold . <P> Blanchard charges more than $1,000 a person for his elegant sessions , which are held in Bermuda and other resort spots . <P> Last November , 4,500 people paid up to $445 each to attend his National Committee for Monetary Reform Conference . The people who attend the three-to five-day conclaves are primarily successful businessmen , doctors and attorneys . They are seeking advice on beating inflation and place great emphasis on personal contact with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own seminars : " People go for the same reason that they go to church instead of staying home and reading Scriptures . They like to hear the sermon . " Speakers like Ruff and Rukeyser are paid as much as $10,000 for each appearance , but that is only part of the lure . The real attraction for many is the unparalleled opportunity to hawk their high-priced newsletters , books and cassette tapes . Notes Rukeyser : " I 'm often the only one there who is n't selling anything . " The standard sales pitch on the investment circuit is fear and more fear . Most speakers describe the economy as falling too fast to be rescued by any Administration . They urge audiences to put their money in tangible products , such as gold , diamonds , real estate and Persian rugs . Casey , 34 , has advised audiences to leave their property in a basement safe in stead of a safe-deposit box or to speculate in the real estate of countries such as Chile and Colombia when , he says , political troubles have depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
