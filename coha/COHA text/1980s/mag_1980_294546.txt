Why college basketball is so much livelier than the pro game <P> One month ago , players on 23 conference-winning college basketball teams packed their travel bags , stroked their press clippings for luck , and set off to do battle in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships . Arrayed against them were 25 other squads rated by the N.C.A.A. as the best of the rest . From then on , it was jump ball in arenas from coast to coast as the annual season-ending scramble proceeded . <P> One by one , touted teams were upset . The nation 's No. 1-ranked school , DePaul , which went into the championships with a 26-1 record , was toppled in its very first game , by a renascent U.C.L.A. North Carolina ( 21-7 ) , a perennial power in the proud Atlantic Coast Conference , was whipped in its opening duel , by lowly Texas A. &M.; Bad Bobby Knight 's oh so good Indiana team , Big Ten champion , fell to Purdue . Duke , which was sixth in the A.C.C. standings , rose up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the final four teams met in Indianapolis to decide the championship , the only survivor among the 23 conference winners was the University of Louisville , ranked in the top five nationally with a 31-3 record . After getting by Iowa in the semis , Louisville took the title by beating U.C.L.A. , 59-54 , in a come-from-behind effort led by everybody 's All-American , Senior Guard Darrell Griffith . <P> Griffith , the tournament 's Most Valuable Player , is an extraordinary outside shooter , and his pyrotechnic leaps for dunks and rebounds brought the school its first national title in any sport . The cheerful , 6-ft. 4-in. son of a Louisville steelworker . Griffith , 21 , had carried his junior high and high school teams to state trophies , and he had hoped to do the same for his college . After the win , he exulted : " When I came here , I said that before I left , we 'd get a national championship . Now I can say that I did n't let too many people down . " <P> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most exciting and unpredictable sports in the country today . A talented newcomer can walk into a moribund basketball program and make his school a conference contender in his first year and a national champion before he departs for the pros . Last season , the aptly named Magic Johnson finished his sophomore year by tucking the national title under Michigan State 's arm , then went to the Los Angeles Lakers . The national exposure that comes with a trip to the N.C.A.A. tournament can help in fund raising and in keeping dorms and classes filled . After Larry Bird and his Indiana State teammates reached the final four last year , interest in the school soared ; this year applications are up by 25% . <P> Some rule changes have helped assure that the talent that makes such success possible is spread around .
