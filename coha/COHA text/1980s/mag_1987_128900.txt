Before the airwaves stop turning bluer than the grass in the vicinity of Louisville , let me add another angle to the hypotenuse of why defending NCAA champion Louisville should have been invited to the NCAA basketball tournament : merely because they are the defending champs . This has been a pet peeve at least since the shindig went TV big time and the field was expanded to include more teams than Dicky Vitale can identify . Quick , oh Lord of the My 's : Who has the better record , Fairfield or Idaho State ? Gotcha . They tied at 15  --  all . Your serve . // Both tennis and golf have systems allowing famous champions to participate in major events . Why does n't college basketball ? " Wild cards " they are sometimes called , a term that seems to mock the NCAA 's sorry decision not to select the Ville 's erratic birds . // So Denny Crum 's team finished 2-10 against opponents ranked in somebody 's top 50 , 18-14 overall , and suffered a humbling 23-point hometown loss to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LSU lost 14 games as well , including a recent nail-biter to Auburn by 38 points , and got a bid . While Louisville was dauntlessly facing Indiana , DePaul , Syracuse and Purdue  --  four of the top 12 seeds  --  LSU was feeding Kibbles ' n Bits to Hardin-Simmons , West Virginia State , Illinois-Chicago and Dennison. // The Cards lost their glamour games , but they beat invitees Western Kentucky and Wyoming on the road and embarrassed ACC champion N.C. State . And I would bet selection committee chairman Dick Schultz several dishes of ? touff ? e at the Bon Ton in New Orleans that if Louisville were to play the bottom 32 teams in the NCAA field right now , the Cardinals would finish 24-8 or better . But even if the team was n't the Ville , the defending champion deserves a free pass . // Not to malign the committee as being less than honorable  --  Notre Dame athletic director Gene Corrigan is a friend with a glorious sense of humor . But when I asked Corrigan if the Louisville snub could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete in the league tournament while on probation , I could scarcely believe my ears when he answered in the negative . " A slap at our conference , " said Crum , " which is what I said would happen . Unfortunately , we have to pay the price for a mistake our conference made . " // Moreover , it was hardly a stunning coincidence that the other most deserving team not invited to the Final 64 , Florida State , also plays in the , excuse me , Metro . The 18-10 Seminoles beat Alabama and Florida but were bypassed in favor of , among others , San Diego , whose best win was Utah in its opener ; Houston ( 18-11 ) , which lost seven games in a football conference ; and Middle Tennessee State , whose famous victims included Cumberland , Kennesaw and Lincoln Memorial  --  the school not the statue . // As for the pairings , dismiss the grandstanding outrage of Billy Packer at Purdue 's being dropped from a first to a third seed in the East . The NCAA was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home courts in the East and Southeast , respectively , or keep Purdue in the Midwest with Indiana , or send the Boilermakers out West , where they might have to play someone at home ( Arizona in Tucson ) for the third time in the last four years . Purdue coach Gene Keady should be satisfied where he is , although I suspect this team will find it too difficult to recover from that 104-68 mauling from Michigan in time to beat dangerous Florida in the second round . // What 's most disturbing about the draw is the NCAA 's continued disregard for home-court advantage . Nobody begrudges North Carolina , Indiana , DePaul , Syracuse or Alabama opening the tournament in front of friendly crowds as a reward for fine seasons . But does Arizona , the 10th seed in the West , deserve to stay home and be favored over 7th-seeded UTEP ? Or does Alabama-Birmingham , 11th in the Southeast , deserve to open against No. 6 Providence in Birmingham ? Even more ridiculous is the possibility that Arizona and UAB might then play Iowa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in full view of home folks in full cry . // " Hey , Navy had to play Syracuse at the Carrier Dome last year , " says Corrigan . " What did the Orange lose by , 25 ? " The score was 97-85 , and not everybody has a David Robinson . // My dark horse pick is tough , resourceful Mizzou , with the preening , caterwauling , Band-Aid-draped Derrick Chievous . This kid is a very special player , a Monster . More routinely , I 'll go with Carolina , Georgetown , Temple ( if the Owls shoot near 50% ) and Iowa to reach the Final Four , with the Tar Heels to win . // But my wild card is still the wild Cards .
