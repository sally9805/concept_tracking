While Detroit 's automakers have been aided by six years of quotas on imported Japanese cars , guess who else has benefited handsomely ? Answer : the very rivals that the quotas sought to curb . The trade limits created a shortage of Japanese autos in U.S. showrooms , thus enabling their makers to raise prices and boost their revenues by as much as $2 billion a year . That extra profit , which came out of the pockets of U.S. consumers , gave the Japanese automakers even more money for research to improve their competitive position against Detroit . <P> This unsettling phenomenon is by no means unique to the auto industry . It is occurring more and more as the U.S. persuades foreign countries to accept import limits on textiles , machine tools , sugar , meat and carbon steel , among other items . As pressure for more trade legislation builds this year in Congress , a growing number of economists and legislators have concluded that there must be a better way to run a quota system . <P> One idea that shows particular promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving away the import allowances , proponents ask , why not sell off the quotas to the highest bidders ? Under the current system the U.S. leaves it to foreign governments to decide how quotas should be apportioned among their companies , which pay no money for the exporting privileges . But under an auction plan , the U.S.-based companies that import the products would bid directly to the Federal Government for a share of the quota , bringing a whole new source of income to the U.S. Treasury . <P> The Government could use the proceeds to put a noticeable dent in the federal budget . Quota auctions might bring in revenues as high as $7 billion a year , according to C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Institute for International Economics , a Washington research organization . Some of the money could be used to help modernize the beleaguered U.S. industries that the quotas were designed to protect , which might reduce the need for further trade limits . <P> The concept appears to be gaining momentum . Montana Democrat Max Baucus , plans to introduce , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried out in the next three cases in which the U.S. imposes temporary quotas . Many economists , most of whom reject protectionism in general , see quotas as sometimes inevitable and thus regard the auction system as a way for the U.S. to get maximum benefit from them . <P> Yet the auctioning of quotas has been put into effect by only two countries , Australia and New Zealand . It could create potential complications for a trading nation as large as the U.S. Many U.S.-based importers and retailers believe that auctions could disrupt their steady supply of foreign goods . But advocates of the idea predict that an active secondary market for so-called quota tickets would quickly develop , so that bidders who wound up with excess quota allowances could sell their tickets to others who come up short . <P> So far the Reagan Administration has opposed the concept of mandatory auctions . One reason : foreign governments may become less willing to agree to quotas with the U.S. , since the Government would be reaping the excess profits that foreign companies once took home . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windfall revenue is precisely what makes the auction idea so alluring .
