As a spymaster with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II , William Casey was an action-oriented operator who dropped agents behind enemy lines . As Ronald Reagan 's director of Central Intelligence 40 years later , Casey chafed at Washington 's restrictive atmosphere . That , says a subordinate , &; was one reason Casey brushed off warnings from top assistants and teamed up with Lieut . Colonel Oliver North to swap arms for hostages with Iran . <P> " Bill Casey was the last great buccaneer from OSS , " said Clair George , the CIA 's chief of covert operations . " He saw in Ollie North a part of that , and he liked Ollie . " Transcripts of George 's remarks , made in closed sessions with Congress 's Iran-contra committees in early August , were released last week . Unnamed officials in the White House , said George , considered the CIA too timid on covert action . " The way to handle Bill Casey was to outflank him to the right . . . suggest that maybe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reaction , reinforced by intense White House pressure to free American hostages in Lebanon , was to go along with what George called some " harebrained schemes . " Casey ignored his aides ' objections to using outsiders , such as retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord . The director also relied on Iranian Manucher Ghorbanifar as a middleman , despite CIA warnings that Ghorbanifar had been shown to be " dishonest and untruthful . " When George learned that Casey nevertheless intended to seek Ghorbanifar 's help , he took the rare step of telling his boss , " Bill , I 'm not going to run this guy anymore . . . He is a bum . " <P> George claimed that Casey wanted North and the National Security staff to handle the Iran initiative , because he knew that his own aides , including CIA Deputy Director John McMahon as well as George , were opposed . <P> Nor did some of Casey 's men share their chief 's admiration for North . Alan Fiers , who worked with North on the contra-resupply operation as chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committees , " I never knew Colonel North to be an absolute liar , but I never took anything he said at face value . " <P> The Iran-contra deals could lead to indictments against North , Secord and former National Security Adviser John Poindexter . Associates of Poindexter 's said last week the admiral intends to retire Oct. 1 , well before he might have to stand trial . North 's magic , meanwhile , seems to have faded . A recent New York Times-CBS poll shows only 33% supporting U.S. aid to the Nicaragua contras , vs. 40% shortly after North 's emotional testimony to Congress in July .
