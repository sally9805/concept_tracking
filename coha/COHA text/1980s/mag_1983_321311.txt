The Justices okay tax aid for parochial school education <P> One of the dearly held goals of the Reagan Administration has been to provide financial relief for parents sending children to private schools . But even the plan 's most fervent supporters have worried that it might not withstand a constitutional challenge . Though the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld laws permitting states to provide secular textbooks to both private and public schools and to pay for transporting students to private as well as public academies , it has regularly struck down other forms of aid . Reason : since so many private schools are connected to a religion , most public assistance leads to a forbidden entanglement of church and state . <P> Last week the court appeared to soften its traditional stance by upholding a Minnesota statute that allows parents to take tax deductions for education costs at a church-affiliated private school . The action gave new heart to the Reagan Administration . Said U.S. Solicitor General Rex Lee : " It 's an important new beachhead . " The Minnesota statute authorizes deductions of $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transportation " for any child in grade or high school . By a 5-to-4 vote , the court found Minnesota 's plan crucially different from other tax programs that had been ruled unconstitutional because the benefit is available to all parents , whether their children attend private or public schools . <P> Writing for the majority , Justice William Rehnquist brushed aside the argument that parents of children in public schools may find it impossible to scrape up $700 in deductions ; nor was Rehnquist concerned that 96% of private school children whose parents took the benefits attend parochial schools . Even though religious institutions may profit most from the law , Rehnquist wrote , a program " that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause " of the First Amendment . <P> Speaking for the dissenters , Thurgood Marshall warned that " this result is flatly at odds with the fundamental principle that a state may provide no financial support whatsoever to promote religion . " Indeed , after the decision was announced , public school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to the draining of funds from an already strapped state educational system . Said Matthew Stark , executive director of the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union , which had tried to overturn the statute : " The public school system has been the great socializer . It 's one of the few common meeting grounds in America . The Supreme Court decision is threatening the very existence of that system . " <P> Responded St. Paul Attorney Joseph O'Neill , who represents a parents ' group that supports tuition breaks : " Diversity , competition and plurality are basic in a democracy . " There may now be more such competition . A day after the court 's action , New Jersey legislators introduced a new tax-exemption proposal , and other states are expected to follow . At the federal level , the Reagan Administration is backing a bill giving parents tax credits to cover private school tuition .
