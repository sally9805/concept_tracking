Former First Ladies do not make a habit of returning to the White House , except , of course , in the tasteful form of a commissioned portrait . So it was that a painting of a soft , almost melancholy Rosalynn Carter , 57 , quietly made its debut last week in the ground-floor corridor , where pictures of all the 20th century First Ladies are hung . Though the Carters left Washington in 1980 , Rosalynn was too busy to pose for Artist George Augusta until September of last year . But the delay has not hurt . " She is still young , and she left before showing the effects of office , " observes White House Curator Clement Conger . To make room for the painting on the left side of the door to the Diplomatic Reception Room , the traditional position for the most recent First Ladies , Conger moved the painting of Pat Nixon to the east lobby . He tactfully insists that Mrs. Nixon 's new position in the portrait pecking order is only slightly less prominent .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
