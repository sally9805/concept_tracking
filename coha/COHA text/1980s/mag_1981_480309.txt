THE CONSERVATIVE tide that swept the country last November produced no more astonishing upset than the election of Alfonse D'Amato , an ob scure local politician from Long Island , to the office of United States senator from New York . His election was all the more astonishing because his campaign , conducted in the journalism capital of the world , was such a successful misportrayal . D'Amato ran as a Reaganite , whose ten years in elected office in the suburbs had been spent pruning government waste and unburdening taxpayers ? a fitting background for the new conservatism of the Eighties . But from the beginning of the campaign there was abundant evidence that the senator-to-be 's past betrayed his punctilious image . In the campaign 's closing weeks it was known though not widely pub-lished ? that several state and federal prosecutors and grand juries were looking into affairs that D'Amato had helped preside over as chief executive of the Town of Hempstead and a member of the governing board of surrounding Nassau County . These affairs had cost the taxpayers dearly . They involved graft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal of the D'Amato candidacy is that what was known before the election was n't widely published . The story of Al D'Amato 's foibles and alleged foibles did run , at great length . in the Village Voice , a New York City weekly . Some of the Voice 's reporting was inaccurate or unfair . but , on reconstruction , most of the long gray columns the Voice ran seem on target . The state 's major newspapers did some sniffing around , but never printed the story . Newsday , the Long Island paper , had produced dogged investigative reports on D'Amato in the past ( several years ago a Newsday expos ? aborted a plan under which a company partially owned by D'Amato 's father and brother would have gotten a county maintenance contract that D'Amato himself , as head of the related county gov ernment committee , would have controlled ) . For the senatorial election last year , however , Newsday chose to concentrate on the candidate 's daily campaign activities . Nor did television pick up on leads from the Voice . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , assigned an award-winning staffer to the hunt . According to District Attorney Denis Dillon , the only Democrat to hold high office in Nassau County , " The newspapers in New York started focusing on whether he D'Amato committed a crime , or whether he was going to be indicted . And that really was n't the point . The point is whether a man who presided over all these abuses as supervisor of Hempstead should be elected . If we get down to whether a politician has committed a crime , and that 's the only issue , we 've reached a pretty sorry state . " A good distinction . wants to curtail ) . Those around D'Arnato say he wants to be the first U.S. president of Italian descent and already is planning a vice-presidential bid in 1984 , with no worse prospects than he had of being U.S. senator three years ago . But if we look behind the conservative rhetoric , we find in Nassau County a patronage-laden , one-party political system that doles out welfare to the rich and cheats those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's entire career has been as an operating cog in that political machine . He has n't been a particularly greedy cog . He appears to live , as he says , well within his official salary , with his wife and four children in a house he bought twelve years ago for $28,000 , his family 's newest car a 1978 Mercury . Nor has he been a particularly sinister cog ? he even claims to have reformed some of the machine 's seedier practices . But he has n't been a reluctant cog. either . For example , there is the way his campaign was financed . Nassau County must surely be one of the few places in America where CETA employees donate hundreds of dollars from their precious , federally subsidized incomes to a conservative Republican Senate candidate who has pledged to slash government spending . CETA , the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act , is a taxpayer-funded program to give job training to the " disadvantaged " and " long-term unemployed . " " When you believe in something , you make a lot of sacrifices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research aide " for Hempstead . So on January 11 , 1980. soon after D'Amato announced his seemingly prayerless Senate candidacy . Mrs. Maggio sacrificed $800 of her **27;3596;TOOLONG salary to his campaign . Geraldine Nolan , a $16,000-a-year CETA " planner , " who is twenty-six and single , also gave $750 on January 11 ? " to support my party , " she says . Only $50 of such gifts can be used as tax credit . A cursory check of federal campaign records turned up at least seven CETA employees who gave between $250 and $800 on the samedate , including Candice Dunninger , twenty-three and single , a $12,000-a-year " researcher , " who gave $250 . Says Ms. Dunninger , " I belong to the Republican party . I do n't really go to the meetings , it 's just that I hang out with Republicans . " Ms. Dunninger has since been promoted to a $16,000-a-year non-CETA job with the county sheriff . President Reagan has asked Congress to do away with CETA . All three of these women say they gave spontaneously , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just because they believed in him . So do many other local-government employees who tithed to the machine and its Senate candidate . For his part . D'Amato says , " Maybe they contributed because I was able to keep that system going in a way that was favorable . " Favorable to whom ? D'Amato 's old office in the Hempstead Town Hall is surrounded by a blighted area of closed-down storefronts and goingout-ol-business sales on whose streets are seen unemployed people of the sort CETA was designed to help . But D'Amato concedes that under his control the town may have awarded most of the CETA jobs to people with Republican party connections . " The GOP was more efficient in alerting its friends to apply for CETA aid , " he says . Thus many CETA jobs , he admits , went to the children of relatively well-to-do Republican families . In fact , D'Amato adds , some of these sons and daughters of his supporters and associates , in order to get their CETA jobs , had to lie about their household incomes by saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than express outrage at such perjury , Senator D'Amato recently argued that the law should be relaxed so that middle-class kids could legally qualify for federal job aid . There is no reason to believe that the three women mentioned above broke any laws to get their public jobs , nor is there evidence that D'Amato illegally solicited contributions for jobs as a specific quid pro q uo . NCE A corrupt system is established , like the Mafia , or Tammany Hall , or the Nas- sau County Republican Committee , it tends to feed on itself . Its reputation does its talking , and anyway , most of the favored slots that are available have already been filled by insiders , people known to be willing , and even eager , to play ball , people who by and large do n't need to be told anything . Federal and state disclosure records of D'Amato 's campaigns are rife with major donations from low-paid public workers ( a bridge operator gave $500 last year , a county nurse , $1,000 ) , to say nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing business with the town or county . i $1,000 is the maximum personal gift allowed by law ; all gifts of $100 or more must be reported . ) Myles H. Tanenbaum , a partner in and executive vice president of Kravco Inc. , a real-estate management firm in King of Prussia , Pennsylvania , is an example . " We were planning to expand an existing shopping mall in Hempstead , " he says . " You have to go through various steps . " One such step , if the town demands it and the state approves , is filing a costly environmental-impact statement . Says Tanenbaum , " Our consultant on environmental issues fold us that under the law we did not have to file . " Nevertheless , he adds , " We were solicited by mail by Armand P. D'Amato the senator 's brother , a Nassau County lawyer and state assemblyman for a contribution " to the Senate campaign . Kravco was also solicited , Tanenbaum says , by its own Nassau County lawyer , who happened to be the Republican mayor of Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hempstead . The wording of both these solicitations , taken in isolation , seems perfectly innocent . For his part , Myles Tanenbaum leaves no doubt that he gave the $500 to D'Amato 's campaign on February 23 , 1980 , with full and enthusiastic belief in the conservative cause . " I hear the Star Spangled Banner ' sometimes and I cry ? there 's no place else in 18 the world where I could have accomplished what I 've accomplished , " Tanenbaum says . Whether the six other Kravco executives , who also live in Pennsylvania and who gave identical gifts to D'Amato ( except one , who gave only $250 ) on exactly the same date , were acting out of a completely spontaneous devotion to conservative ideals is another question . But even Tanenbaum says , " Obviously when you give political contributions it 's because you want your guy in power rather than some other guy . At least when you go up to the king you do n't have two strikes against you . That 's the system we 've created out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to listen to you ? Or that you own him ? " Tanenbaum insists that , in his case , it 's only the listening , and this is plausible . Even so , Kravco did n't have to file an environmental-impact statement . And you have to wonder how much it should cost in a democracy for the right to be listened to . D'Amato , scarcely known outside Nassau County , managed to raise funds in pace with his two widely known opponents , four-term Sen. Jacob Javits and four-term Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman . According to incomplete figures at the campaign 's close , he appeared to have raised more than either . Back in 1977 , when he ran for presiding supervisor of Hempstead , a kind of combination mayor and city-council president , Newsday reported that he raised $192,000 , ten times as much as the previous Republican candidate and a hundred times as much as his token Democratic opponent . A 1975 report on patronage issued by the New York State Civil Service Commission described Hempstead as " without exception the worst of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors . More than half the workers were classified as " provisional " and thus excluded from civil service . Since 1970 , D'Amato had been one of two Hempstead " supervisors , " who , besides running the town , tend to control the population-weighted board of supervisors that governs Nassau County . Hempstead has 800,000 people , more than Boston , Washington , or San Francisco . During D'Amato 's years in office , Hempstead spent millions of taxpayer dollars to spruce up and maintain two of its three public beaches for the use of families that rent one of the 800 luxury cabanas the town owns . D'Amato concedes that Republican insiders were given first crack at renting the cabanas and gobbled them up . He says cabana rental now is done on a first-come , first-served basis , though he admits that the waiting time for one is seven years . Outsiders complain that half of Hempstead 's public beach land is nothing but a private Republican social club . To be sure , the cabana system , Iike the patronage system , long predated D'Amato 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in 1969 , but even before , most county officeholders were Republicans . The machine was headed , then as now , by boss Joseph Margiotta , a Hempstead lawyer . D ' AMATO never knew any career but the machine . After graduating from law school in 1961 , he was recommended by the local state assemblyman , Joseph Carlino , a family friend , for a job as law clerk in the county attorney 's office . From there he went to the family court as law assistant for a couple of years , then to the Hempstead town attorney 's office . In 1969 he became server of taxes and then moved his way up to town and county supervisor . Of course , some participants in such a system are corrupted less , or at least less permanently , than others . Honest federal officials no doubt have emerged from Chicago , Philadelphia , New Jersey , and Maryland . Harry Truman emerged from Pendergast-ruled Kansas City . But there are n't any accounts that Truman personally tainted himself in the way that D'Amato and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that featured D'Amato 's mother , for example , was the candidate 's father , Armand M. D'Amato . Without the rigors of a civil-service exam but with his son 's help , the elder D'Amato became research director for the Nassau County department of commerce and industry in 1972 . The job now pays him $34,000 a year so that he can , in his words , " keep abreast of the current statistics in the field of economics as they apply to the County of Nassau . " He also edits the department newsletter . It 's a full-time job , he says , but " on nights and weekends " he still manages to keep up the insurance agency he 's owned for forty-three years . Among its longtime clients is the Village of Island Park , a subunit of Hempstead . According to charges by the State Commission of Investigation , and more recently by a federal grand jury , the commissions from insur- slice purchases by Nassau County 's various governments have for many years provided a kickback pool from which the county Republican leader passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokers who help elect Republicans . In fact , according to local political observers , although the formal charges have never been so specific , the kickback pool is distributed on a ratio exactly corresponding to the number of Republican votes cast in each broker 's district in the most recent election . Shortly after last November 's election , county Republican leader Joseph Margiotta and another Nassau politician ? a former judge ? were indicted in federal court in Brooklyn on charges that they had defrauded the county through this insurance scheme . The indictment directly implicates Senator D'Amato in the alleged plot , though he was n't charged . Three of the six counts of the indictment clearly state that the foundation of the alleged insurance scheme was the " reasonable belief " by insurance providers " that the Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead ... would appoint or dismiss as Broker of Record for the Town of Hempstead ... any person whom the defendant Joseph M. Margiotta told hind to appoint or dismiss , " and that if an insurance provider " did not make and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Margiotta , it would not be appointed as Broker of Record for the Town of Hempstead .... " Between January 1977 and December 1979 , a period covered by the three counts , the only presiding supervisor Hempstead had was Alfonse D'Amato . The senator denies wrongdoing in the matter , but wo n't comment further . Both he and his father testified I before the grand jury that indicted Mr. Margiotta , but both declined a request to make their testimony public for this article . As for his son 's helping him to a $34,000-a-year public job , the elder D'Amato says , " If my son did n't help me , then he 's not deserving of a good father . " Mr. Margiotta 's trial ended last spring with a hung jury . " had ever " made known that type of policy to him and I think if it is the case ... I would certainly use my influence to see to it that it would not be collected . " In last fall 's campaign , however , an old letter surfaced that indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader , " I have spoken to Mr. Margiotta and he has indicated to me that the raise for ... would he approved if he took care of the 1 percent . Accordingly , please find a cheek for $75 . " Asked recently about the apparent conflict between this letter and his sworn testimony , Senator D'Amato said that in the 1971 case he had merely been trying to do the man , a sanitation worker , a favor . " What I did was put up $75 for that man so he could get what he was entitled to the raise , " D'Amato said . " I in no way asked him for that money . I never would . No one should be compelled to give in order to get what he 's entitled to . " He said the letter was " in no way in conflict " with his sworn testimony , that he did n't know of any policy requiring a gift to get a raise . " I 'm not going to quibble with you over it , " he said . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward machine politics . " No one ever came to me ... and said to me that you had to give , " he testified . " But there is a generalknowledge which really permeated the area that a one-percent contribution did serve as a guideline .... This goes back to when I started in , I guess , 1961 .... They were very tough economic times . I used to take home $83 a week . Let me tell you when you talk about $83 a week and a wife and child and a car and a little apartment , things were rough and so to give $10 or $20 was a lot of money at that time . But I did .... " D'Amato says the one-percent system ended after the 1977 convictions were upheld , but system or no system , the workers , contractors , and businessmen seeking favors from the town or county still seem to be anteing up . Substantial D'Amato campaign gifts came from local businessmen who lease to the town its trucking fleet without competitive bidding ( if the town purchased trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state law would require competitive bidding ; reporter Dan Hertzberg of Newsday , and now the Wall Street Journal , once identified fifty-seven Republican committeemen or members of their families who rented trucks to Hempstead ) . Gifts came to the D'Amato campaign from people with recently awarded contracts to operate restaurants and golf concessions on town property under what appear to be favorable terms . They came from a family that owns disco bars , operating without required town permits , where major drug deals have been uncovered . Some businessmen and public employees gave up to the legal limit within a few days of receiving raises , promotions , tax abatements , or other benefits . Senator D'Amato says the timing links were coincidental . The D'Amato campaign got loans below the prime interest rates that were apparently unavailable to his leading opponent , Representative Holtzman ? front the Bank of New York . Town records indicate the bank , long D'Amato 's personal bank , received the largest share of the $847 million that the Hempstead tax receiver deposited in non-interest-bearing accounts ( free money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-interest deposits were criticized by a 1978 state grand jury , and Senator D'Amato acknowledges he may have helped solicit party contributions from the recipient banks , though not recently . p ROSECUTOR DILLON describes most of D'Amato 's alleged activities as " legal graft , " which he says he ca n't prosecute . In his words : " You have a political party out here that gives out jobs and takes back donations . There are people who are politicians , not educators , who are teaching over at Nassau Community College . I do n't know many politicians who do business with contractors who do n't take contributions from contractors . It 's an abuse of the taxpayer . But unless I can show there 's some kind of force or threat being used , or that donations are being collected on public property , I ca n't prosecute . " He talks about prosecuting the one-percent racket in 1977 . " There was extortion involved . Foremen were making threats . You say everybody knows about it . What are we supposed to do ? go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way we could get them was for collecting on public property . And what did they wind up with , these guys ? Unconditional discharges . And they 're still commis-sioners ? " Such was the basis for a Justice Department investigation of D'A mato 's campaign financing , announced shortly after the election . Meanwhile , Dillon briefly investigated ( then dropped , for lack of any apparent criminal violation ) Senator D'Amato 's role in the award of a cable-television franchise in July 1980 , without public announcement , discussion , or bidding . The franchise went to a concern 20-percent owned by the law firm of Joseph Margiotta. and by another major contributor to the county GOP and to the D'Amato campaign . D'Amato defends the award on the grounds that the town was just transferring a franchise that had originally been awarded many years ago , after bidding , to a firm that later became defunct . He says he knew about Margiotta 's interest in the successor firm , though other members of the town board who voted may not have known . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert Wright , president of Cox , declines to say what the Margiotta law firm paid for its potentially lucrative interest . " I do n't think they paid a great deal . I do n't know that I 'd like to go into it , " he says . Chuck Dolan , chief executive of Cablevision Systems Development Co. , Cox 's main competition on Long Island , is furious . " It seemed incredible to us , " he says . " We assume that an action like that would be taken like that only to accommodate somebody they would want to accommodate . " Republican leader Margiotta ? " Totally , obviously , " he says . A former employee of Cox who participated in the making of the deal says that the Margiotta group stands to make $500 for every home that connects to the system ? the going rate for the resale of cable-TV stock . " He 's going to make a lot of money ? I mean a lot of money , " the ex-employee says . Senator D'Amato 's name has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation at a scandal-ridden $137-million recycling plant in Hempstead , which D'Amato personally sponsored and pushed through . One man convicted , in federal court on Long Island , is George Boylin , a prominent labor leader found to have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal payoffs on the recycling plant and other jobs . Evidence at his trial , and elsewhere , indicates that a broad scheme was afoot . It worked this way : The recycling plant was being built by Parsons &; Whittemore , an international construction firm D'Amato had brought in . ( Parsons &; Whittemore had been assured of the job because bidding specifications called for a process that only Parsons &; Whittemore had ; company officials , of course , have given generously to the Nassau Republican party and to D'Amato campaigns . ) Boylin and ) ther union leaders began creating abor problems at the worksite , cans.ng expensive delays . Two local fixersapproached the beleaguered Parsons &; Whittemore plant manager , a man whom D'Arnato says he " knew well , " and who the company says has been fired " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom D'Amato says he does n't know , persuaded the plant manager to let them supply him with contractors who would cost a lot , but who would be acceptable to the unions . Construction proceeded , but with huge cost overruns , and the plant has now been closed because of high recycling prices and toxic emissions . One witness testified that he was told some of the payoff money was to go to D'Amato , though there was n't any evidence that D'Amato actually took any . The senator says he knows nothing about payoffs . But he acknowledges that both he and the town sanitation commissioner , William Landman , referred many contractors to Parsons &; Whittemore . Landman was one of the commissioners convicted in the one-percent political-contribution racket in 1977 . But Landman says the recycling-plant job referrals he was making at about the same time had nothing to do with contributions . I asked Parsons &; Whittemore for comment , and was referred to a source outside the company but intimately familiar with its operations , who requested that his name not be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwanted subcontractors who may have made political payoffs , the source replied , " Nobody ever said in so many words you got ta do this , but there were suggestions . It was clear that the Town of Hempstead , meaning the presiding supervisor , now our eminent senator , would send Parsons &; Whittemore letters saving these are qualified people , he 's a good person . " The source said the company was telling its story to a federal grand jury in January 1981 . S ENATOR D'AMATO 'S basic response to all this is to point to his hard work and personal sobriety , and to argue that he tried to improve the system while working within it . He credits himself with " dealing with these situations ? and they were abuses ? worse than abuses , irregularities ? and from your point of view they could be called more than irregularities ? I think I dealt with them . " Shortly before he left office , he points out , Hempstead began to self-insure ( cutting down on the commissions ) , to put its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under civil-service exam , and even to award any abandoned beach cabanas to the longest-waiting applicant . But those closest to the senator concede that some or all of the " reforms " came only because of pressure by outside investigators : D.A . Dillon , for example , seized a copy of the waiting list for beach cabanas . Nor does anyone contend that the " reforms " have abolished machine politics in Nassau County . At the very least , the whole business calls into question the true conservatism of D'Amato or of anyone who comes out of such a system . Mario Colleluori , president of the Taxpayers Union of Long Island , who considers himself a true conservative , says that D'Amato in office was " anything but " a genuine conservative . " During our attempts to lower taxes here in Nassau County , I regret to say that Mr. D'Amato was not of much help , " Colleluori says . " We are the highest-taxed county in the country a frequently stated ' fact , ' probably not far off the mark , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... This is something that the taxpayers will one day realize . " Where people tolerate a one-party system , relationships begin to emerge between businessmen and government , favors go back and forth , and the taxpayers are the ones paying the bills . In Nassau County it happens to be Republican . If it were Democratic it would be the same thing . Those elected officials who participate in it , condone it , and tolerate it are part of that system . They can not separate themselves from that system . D'Amato is part and parcel of the system . Mr. D'Amato is a beneficiary of it . "
