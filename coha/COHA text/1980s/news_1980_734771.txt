txt IT HAPPENED years ago , when Sgt. George Coleman was a younger man . The sergeant tells the story now with a chuckle . A pharmacist surprised a burglar in his store , and the burglar fled into the cellar . The druggist called the police , and Coleman and his partner responded . " He 's down in there , " the pharmacist said excitedly , pointing to a dark hole which was the basement ? a basement with no electric light and cluttered from floor to ceiling with junk . Coleman looked at his partner and both of them peered down into the dark hole . " I guess , " said his partner , " that is what we get paid , to do , " and the two of them descended into the dark . Stumhling around in the blackness , tripping over piles of junk , humping into posts , they began looking for the burglar . Not wanting to make themselves easy targets , they flicked their flashlights on for only a fraction of a second at a time , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policemen , patrolmen and detectives , descended into the dark cellar and joined the search . But no one could find the burglar . Coleman had his gun out as he poked and probed in the dark , afraid that any minute the burglar might blast away at him or at another policeman who got too close . " Then I stumbled and lost my balance , " says Coleman , " and my gun went off accidentally . And all of a sudden , right in front of me , the burglar jumped up from behind a couch and yelled , ' Do n't shoot ! Do n't shoot ! I give up . ' " So help me , the other officers thought I found him myself . I never told them differently . They did n't know that me catching that burglar was an accident . " PERHAPS WHAT looked like a heroic act back then was an accident , as Coleman says . But the heroism of Sgt. Coleman at 4 a.m. on the morning of May 10 , 1979 , was no accident . Coleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was alone in his car , cruising , when Ire heard a report over the radio that . a cabdriver had been robbed at 93d Street and Vernon Avenue . The robbers , two males and a female , were said to be walking west on 93d Street . Coleman drove to 93d . There , walking leisurely down Close-up With Anne Keegan the sidewalk , were two males and a female . But they were n't acting suspicious . They were n't behaving as if they had just robbed anyone . They were calm , relaxed , not looking back over their shoulders . Perhaps they were n't the robbery suspects at all . Coleman did not want to be accused of harassing innocent citizens . But he was going to check them out . So , in a gentlemanly fashion , which is his style , he got out of his car and asked all three to stop , to step back on the grass , and kneel down ? the grass being softer for them to kneel on than the sidewalk ' . HE HAD NOT drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the men immediately started to walk away , and Coleman reached out and grabbed him . At that second , the other man pulled a gun and started firing at the sergeant . He emptied his revolver at me , " says Coleman . // Tribune Photo by Quentin Dor11 Sgt. George Coleman : " He emptied his revolver at me . . . I felt a pain in my stomach , and could feel the blood running down . " A hero ? That 's only in books // " He was shooting like he was throwing the shots at me . He got me on the second shot . I felt a pain in my stomach , a dull pain , and I could feel the blood running down . " But it did n't weaken me . I was in good shape , and I was going to stay standing . One of the news reports said I hit the pavement . Now that , " Coleman says with a smile . " sort of takes away from my image ? me lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOUNDED , Coleman remained standing , pulled out his gun . and fired back at the two men , who were running away . ** woman had dropped to the ground for cover.1 The two suspects disappeared around the corner , and Coleman threw his service revolver down on the floor of his squad car in digust , convinced he 'd missed them and allowed them to escape . But he had not missed . And the robbers did not escape . While Sgt. Coleman was being sped to the emergency room , the robbers were found and arrested . He 'd wounded them both . This week Coleman . the grandfather of two and a 24-year veteran of the force , was honored for bravery and heroism . He received the Chicago Police Department 's highest tribute for his actions that morning  --  the Lambert Tree award . The award caught hirb by surprise . " When they said my name and I stood up , " he says , " I did n't know what to say . You know , there are even leaks in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped me off as I would n't have been caught by surprise . Then I 'd have known what to say . But I never thought it would be me . " I DO N'T FEEL any braver than 1 did when I began the job  --  less brave , really . I 'm older now . I do n't drive as fast . I 've seen more . " That night , when it happened , bravery was the last thing I was thinking about . I was doing my job like you do every night when you go to work . I could n't just drive by and let those three go , just because there were three of them and only one of me . I was n't looking for a one-man show . But I 'd been a policeman too long and would have had to live with myself if I had n't stopped them . " Having been shot has not made him timid . " When I was in the hospital , I was afraid it might : but it has n't . Nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made him think of retiring from the force , Which he could have done a year ago . " I do n't feel tired . I 've still got my health . I still like people , and I can still do the job . " Indeed , at midnight , just hours after he 'd been downtown receiving his award , Coleman was back in his one-man car , on patrol . Happy , pleased , but feeling no hero . " Hero ? " he chuckles . " Not me . Heroes are only guys you read about . "
