Onward , ever onward . The music business means to turn VCR fanatics , who spent $7.5 billion buying and renting tapes in 1987 , into music freaks . Two major artists from Columbia Records ( owned , of course , by Sony ) have become point men in this brand-new marketing assault : Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen , who are both releasing new , ambitious feature-length video albums . <P> Jackson 's hot-selling Moonwalker is an eight-segment 94-min. tour through . the Glove 's wide-ranging but uneasy imagination . Besides a lively montage of Jackson 's career ( " a retrospective of 24 years of hits " ) , Moonwalker includes some nifty clay and cutout animation , as well as a " centerpiece " spun out around Michael 's superbly spooky song Smooth Criminal . Jackson becomes , literally , what so many people have already accused him of being : a special effect . All of Moonwalker is heavily shrouded in fantasy  --  of persecution , of reprisal , of reclaiming lost innocence  --  but compromised by its own willful and slightly desperate flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores Jan. 31 . Springsteen 's video is , in contrast to Jackson 's , refreshingly modest and small-scale , as if he shook out the video scrapbook and passed along some souvenirs . Although approximately a third of the 100-min. tape is taken up with material from the 1987 Tunnel of Love album and tour , most of the gems date back a bit further . An early video of Rosalita , made a decade ago , has a real scruffy , low-tech charm . Springsteen quickly learned not only how to play to the camera but how to work with it as well , and you can see the moment it happened , in Brian De Palma 's crafty 1984 rendering of an in-concert Dancing in the Dark . After that , Springsteen performed dazzlingly and acted well ( most notably in John Sayles ' splendid narrative worked around I 'm on Fire ) . He may not be ready to hit the road to Hollywood , but these videos prove that between rock and music , Springsteen 's on a two-way street .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
