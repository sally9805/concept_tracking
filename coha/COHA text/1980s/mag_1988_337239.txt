The loading operation should have been routine : an enormous storage tank at Ashland Oil 's Floreffe , Pa. , facility was slowly filling with No. 2 diesel fuel , and everything seemed to be going according to plan . True , the 40-year- old container was being filled for the first time since having been cut up , moved from Cleveland and reconstructed on the site near the Monongahela River . True , the company did not have the required permit from Allegheny County . And true , Ashland Oil had forgone the standard safety practice of testing the tank with a full load of water . But the vessel had passed less stringent tests , and so the loading went forward . <P> Then , as the 48-ft. - high structure was nearly filled to its capacity of 4 million gal. , something went wrong . The tank suddenly burst like a balloon , loosing its contents in a matter of seconds . Some 3.8 million gal . of the oil erupted in a 35-ft. - high tidal wave that quickly overflowed the earthen dike meant to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gal . inundated nearby Route 837 . The oil then poured through storm sewers into the Monongahela , a once polluted river that over the past ten years has been painstakingly restored to health , and headed for Pittsburgh , 23 miles downstream . <P> Thus began one of the nation 's worst inland oil spills ever . Within 24 hours , 23,000 people in the Pittsburgh area found themselves without tap water . An additional 750,000 were forced to ration their drinking water , 1,200 families were temporarily evacuated , dozens of factories had to shut down , schools were closed and commercial traffic on the river was halted . The oil entered the Ohio River at Pittsburgh 's Golden Triangle , and by week 's end the scene had been replayed downriver as far as Steubenville , Ohio , where an ice jam slowed the oil 's progress . Wheeling , W. Va. , was bracing for the onslaught , and contamination was feared along the Ohio all the way to the Mississippi . The Pennsylvania Fish Commission reported numerous dead fish ; ducks and geese , caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Ashland Oil Chairman John Hall , who quickly declared his company would comply with federal law by footing the entire cleanup bill : " I expect it will be a multimillion-dollar problem . " <P> While Pittsburgh draws its potable water from the unaffected Allegheny River , some nearby cities and towns on the Monongahela were forced to shut off their river intakes completely . The authorities tried to cope by tapping into the fire hydrants of unpolluted water systems and reopening old wells . Governor Robert Casey ordered out the National Guard to help , and decreed mandatory water conservation with a $200 fine for violators . Most people took the inconvenience good-naturedly . In North Fayette , 17 miles south of Pittsburgh , residents switched to paper plates , postponed the laundry and washed at the homes of friends whose water supply was unaffected . Funeral Director Tom Somma used his hearse to deliver bottled water to shut-ins . The local Iron City brewery brought out " party trucks "  --  in effect , giant beer kegs on wheels  --  filled with water .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
