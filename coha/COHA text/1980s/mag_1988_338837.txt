Peace may be just around the corner in the eight-year-old conflict between Iran and Iraq , but it could take a while for the two sides to get there . In the wake of Iran 's surprise announcement two weeks ago that it would agree to a cease-fire , Iraq embarked on a campaign designed to maximize its position in a postwar era . By attempting to gain more leverage in negotiations , however , Baghdad risked encouraging Tehran to return to war . <P> Both countries sent their Foreign Ministers to the United Nations in New York City to discuss how to put into effect Security Council Resolution 598 , which calls for a U.N.-monitored cease-fire . The two officials , Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq , met separately with U.N . Secretary- General Javier Perez de Cuellar . But the peace process foundered over Iraq 's demand for direct talks , which Iran refused for the moment to accept . <P> Meanwhile , Iraqi forces completed a series of thrusts deep into Iranian territory and pulled back to their side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mounted to capture enemy soldiers for use as bargaining chips in an eventual prisoner swap with Iran . Iraq claimed the raids netted 12,000 new captives , bringing its prisoner-of-war total to 35,000 , still well short of the 50,000 Iraqis held in Iran . <P> For Washington , any delay in reaching agreement on a cease-fire would postpone a cutback of U.S. naval forces escorting oil tankers in the Persian Gulf . The Reagan Administration would also be forced to defer its efforts to forge a new relationship with Iran after a hiatus of nearly a decade . Last week Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , speaker of Iran 's parliament , raised that prospect and a good deal more : the possibility of securing Iran 's help in gaining the release of nine American hostages believed held by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon . <P> He tied his offer to a long-held Iranian goal : getting possession of assets , including $400 million worth of armaments , impounded by Washington when relations were severed in 1980 . " Let them ( ( U.S. officials ) ) take a nonhostile pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , we will use our influence in Lebanon . " Reagan Administration officials quickly ruled out the possibility of any deal that had the appearance of an Iran-contra- style ransom . Reagan nonetheless chose to view the comment optimistically , saying , " If they 're willing and ready to talk , it 's time . "
