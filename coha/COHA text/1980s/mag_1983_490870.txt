THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment S s the new Congress gets down to work and the Reagan Adinin-istration embarks on the sec-ond half of its term of office , the nation and the world face two issues of overriding concern : the peril of nuclear war , which has been raised to a new level of urgency by a rapid escala-tion of the arms race , and the peril of economic collapse , including , espe-cially , the peril of a collapse of the international financial system , which is threatened by towering international debts that have accumulated in the last decade or so . Ordinarily , it might seem that few things could resemble each other less than international finance and the nuclear-arms race , but some striking similarities between the two have emerged . The immediate problem facing the international finan-cial community is how to prevent the default of any of a rather long list of countries that are in shaky or , in some cases , desperate financial condition , among them Mexico , Brazil , Poland , and Zaire . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of world finance , and a world depression might ensue . At present , however , the world is in possession of no institution that is empowered to guarantee the solvency of countries , and thereby to insure the world 's solvency . The world may collapse as one if its finan-cial system collapses , but the world can not act as one to prevent such a collapse . In consequence , the decision by even a few creditors to demand full and prompt repayment of a loan to a financially ailing country can now conceivably trigger a global depres-sion . According to an illuminating article in Time , during the recent negotiations between governments and bankers to save Poland from default " it would have been theoretically possible for a small institution that loaned $100,000 or so to bring down that country 's $27 billion dollar house of cards " ? not to mention the global house of cards surrounding it . The world economy is thus held hostage by its individual members  --  individual banks as well as individual countries  --  whose separate interests may diverge sharply from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly constituted international authority , the international community is forced to resort to ad-hoc , semi-secret conclaves of financial people and others , convened on the spur of the moment to deal with emergencies as they arise  --  a course of action that is a little like trying to organize a new fire department every time a fire breaks out . For example , according to Time , when Mexico recently found itself in need of about four and a half billion dollars in credits if it was to go on meeting its international financial obligations " 13 leading U.S. , Japanese , British and West German hankers worked around the clock for nearly two weeks in the 29th-floor dining room of Citicorp headquarters in New York City to keep the country from defaulting . " Later , Time reports , an observer reLe -- rag --  marked that the operation " was handled like a money-raising telethon . " In the nuclear predicament , it is , of course , not the world economy but the world itself that is at stake , yet our response to this peril has a discouraging resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic predicament and our nuclear predicament , the sole path even to individual survival lies in our acknowledgment of the common global interest and in action in common , yet in both predicaments we enshrine individual interest and let the common interest fend for itself , staking the fate of all on the voluntary self-restraint of each party involved . What appears to he at the root of this peculiar situation is not so much a failure of resolve as a failure of observation . In times past , some " idealistic " people dreamed of establishing " one world " to replace the system of separate nation-states , and other , " realistic " people dismissed such a notion as impractical . But while the idealists and the realists were arguing , the world  --  reality itself  --  quietly changed . For reasons that had nothing to do with anyone 's ideals  --  or , for that matter , with anyone 's less creditable impulses  --  economic , technical , and political links tying the people of the earth together like so many mountain climbers on a slope were Forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one world , in which we all now live , whether we like it or not , is no dream but an irrevocable fact , which awaits our recognition and our response . Yearbook Pictures DURING a two-week period when more than eight hundred seniors at Hillcrest High School in Jamaica , Queens , were scheduled to be photographed for their graduation yearbook , we were on hand for one busy afternoon in a small office that Hillcrest provided for the picture-taking . The students who filed in and out were allotted seven and a half minutes each to have their pictures taken in several poses , both in street clothes  --  which meant jacket and tie for the boys and , for the girls , an off-the-shoulder " drape " provided by the photography studio  --  and in cap and gown . In the rear of the darkened little room , the students who were to be called next preened and fussed and chatted furtively while their classmates were being photographed . " I really did well in the tenth grade , " said one girl to another , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all did well in tenth grade , " said her friend . " Then we got diseased by high school . " " I have to take this picture today , " said one boy to another . " I kind of rented this jacket . " " You rented a corduroy sports jacket ? " said the other boy . A girl adjusted the drape so that it revealed the roundness of her shoulders . " This is my last effort to look good for this school , " she announced . " You look like a barmaid in that thing , " another girl told her . " I hate having my picture taken , " a girl complained to a friend as her eyes followed her lipstick in a compact mirror . " I always come out terrible . " " Better talk to your mama about your face , " said a boy who overheard her . " O.K. , gim me a big smile , " said the photographer , speaking above the din of voices and his own Walkman headphones as he backed away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was wearing a purple graduation gown , and he sat with one hand clutching the cap to his heart and the other hand fixed on his knee . His head and his body were cocked at slightly different angles to the camera , with the result that he appeared to be gazing off into the middle distance ; when he smiled , he looked like a blissed-out choirboy . " Hey ! Do n't blow it ! " the photographer said sharply . " This is for the yearbook . Forever , and all that stuff , right ? Ready  --  one , two , three  --  say ' sex ' ! " The camera clicked just as a broad natural smile appeared on the boy 's face . As soon as he could , the boy pulled off the robe , unbuttoned his jacket , whipped off his tie , stepped out of the circle of light surrounding him , faced the other students , and shouted , " This is the beginning of the end ! " Then he turned and left the room . Having followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few of his friends , we learned that he was Nick and that the friends were Debbie , Susan , and Peter . They were discussing yearbooks in general . " I 'd like to see candid photographs that show life in high school as it really is , " said Peter . " You know , like a picture of fifty people hanging around the running track outside of school , drinking and smoking . " " There are three things I like about high-school yearbooks , " said Nick . " The haircuts , the clothes , and the ugly people . " Turning serious , he added , " It 'll be pretty interesting for my kid to see a picture of his pop when he did n't have a clean haircut and a job . " " I like yearbook photographs , " said Debbie . " It shows that you were part of something , part of an achievement . But I ca n't stand the writing  --  it 's so phony . It 's always about the winter breeze and the sun coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it does n't express how seniors really feel . The yearbook turns us into the Brady Bunch . " " You guys are gon na die , " Susan interjected , " but I just found out that the theme of this year 's yearbook is ' Horizons . ' " The group groaned . " Could have been worse , " said a girl named Courtenaye , who had been listening in . " Up until yesterday , the teacher in charge had this thing about anniversaries . Like last year was the one-hundredth year since New York City was electrified . Now , what does that have to do with the 1983 class at Hillcrest High School ? " During a break in the schedule , we leafed through a stack of slips that the photography studio had provided for the students , which included space for personal data like the clubs or organizations they belong to , their hobbies , their nicknames , their favorite quotations , and their goals after graduation  --  information that the yearbook committee might decide to print below the photographs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bead bracelets and that his nickname is Philip ; that Juliet , whose nickname is Thumb , plans to become " Absolute Ruler of All Time Space and Dimension ; " that Johnathan 's favorite quotation is " A day is wasted without laughter " and that his goal is to become an orthopedist ; that Dawn , who professes to like singing and shopping for clothes , chose as her favorite quotation " Life is life , but then again life can be very tedious ; " that David 's goal is " to get into the jewelry business ; " that Sarah 's favorite quotation is " There is no need to be nice on the way up ' cause you 're not comin ' down ; " that Iris , who is known to her friends as Miss Hollywood , and whose favorite quotation is a tossup between " A star is horn " and " If you 've got it flaunt it , " plans to " travel for a year , then continue my education , and finally become a legal secretary ; " that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pediatricians ; that there are two brothers whose favorite quotation is " Ungawa ; " and that one girl 's nickname is Portuguese Baby . Later in the afternoon , we talked to two students who had been photographed at the beginning of the week , and both recounted experiences that had impressed them . Pedro told us that on the day he was to he photographed he dressed up as though he had been invited to a wedding , because he felt great pride in his accomplishments and in his high school . " But when I got to the room to be photographed I saw that one of my friends had n't really paid that much attention to his clothes and he was n't as excited as I was , " Pedro went on . " He looked like he was feeling pressure . He told me , ' Yeah , I 'm taking my picture , but am I gon na graduate ? ' Having to sit for the yearbook pictures was a heavy thing for him . " ' Fiera found that all her school friends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been photographed  --  something they did n't often do . " We all sat ? ? around talking about why we did n't get closer sooner and how we met and how we reacted to each other when we first met , " she told us . " We remembered classes we had together and teachers we liked or ones that got on our nerves . It hit us all of a sudden that after June we 'll probably never see each other again . It was nice talking like that , but it was sad , too . I 'll always have the yearbook photographs to look at , but I thought , Maybe we should get each other 's phone numbers . " The Typewriter THE decline in recent years of certain institutions  --  the convertible , for instance , and real grass on baseball outfields  --  has hurt us profoundly . But now we fear that our bar-none favorite consumer item , the traditional typewriter , may be on the edge of a long and painful descent into obsolescence . At Gimbels , it has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , says Vice-President Robert Gottlieb , considers it a " nonprofit " product . And across the nation , though typewriter sales have held pretty steady , an increasingly large share of the market has been conquered by a device that bears only a superficial resemblance to the real thing . The electronic typewriter , unlike the sturdy manual , or even the jittery electric , is the spawn of the mating of a typewriter with a word processor . It is a purring , simpering machine in which the mechanical response to the push of a button has been replaced by a " memory , " albeit a short one . If typing is driving a car , electronic typing is climbing into the back of a cab . In case our premonition someday turns into sterile , muffled reality , we decided this winter to canvass the Manhattan department stores that still find some percentage in the sale of the proud typewriter . Our purpose : to collect for history 's sake a few of those sheets of practice paper left by retailers in their machines and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feel of the keyboard and to pour out their souls . The last time we attempted anything similar was more than a quarter century ago ; the most common sentiment of the typewriter shopper was then and still is ( we are nostalgically pleased to report ) " Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country " ? a mongrelization of " Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party , " which was the typing test used to demonstrate the first practical machine , in the politically charged autumn of 1867 . An awful lot of people just type the sentence over and over , in capital letters and small letters , in red ink and black . But some take the line and run with it , vamping and jamming and blowing until they come up with some hot new variation . Like : This typewriter comes highly recommended by its makers Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of me ! The touch on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for all good men to come to the aid of me ! Or , in a thought-provoking melange of literary sources : Now is the time for to be or not to be that is the On occasion , shoppers even reflect on the meaning of the line , which does seem to defy logic . ( If now has been the time since 1867 , either it 's been one dandy of a big crisis or the lack of response on the part of good men has been something less than disastrous . ) Our favorite development of this theme was : Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country . Why is now the time ? Maybe it 's too late . Anyway , I think I 'll come about sevenish . The other standard typing test , the one about the quick brown fox hurdling the lazy dog , shows up only occasionally these days , often in mutant form ! The quick red jumped beer the lazy brown dog Most confused of all the shoppers we encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory that what is hard for the tongue must also be hard for the fingers , tapped out , " She sells sea shells by the seashore . " Potential typewriter buyers make up only a small portion of the typing public , and often those with weighty things on their minds who just happen by are the ones who leave the best work . Poets , for instance : Sometimes 1 wonder why I spend these lonely nights dreaming a dream an haunting melody in myn in my reverie Or public-policy analysts : This store is for the birds man ! ! The politics floating around symbolizes the type of petty and cutthroat mentality that permeates so clearly . These are the reasons American management is so decadent on a global comparison . Do what the Japanese do ! ! Forget ego and status and superficiality , and get back to basics , honest and simple hard work and a solid sense of decency and common courtesy to your fellow man is what it takes to elicit favorable results . Or philosophers : This is a joke 's world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on us . There is a world far byebeyond the horoizon Heavenly Father we appreciate you . Or , best of all , rebels : allison and nannettc were here but now there gone they left their names to carry on those who knew them , knew them well those who did n't GO TO HELLMMInIMIM Some writers make brave beginnings and then tail off . " Joseph Jefferson has a lot to think about , " reads the top of an otherwise blank page . " Thank you very much for your valued attention , " another typist pecked , and then THE NEW YORKER. 33 fell silent . " Things are looking up  --  and yet Europe , " typed another . " What do you feel when you fall in love ? " inquired one customer , who can hardly be blamed for not answering . A few ca n't stand the pressure of a blank page . " Let go home now or else I will kill you , " wrote one person . But others take it entirely in stride . One writer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then punched out , on a clean sheet : you ar you are a typewriter . Luncheon 7/V D just what is this particular luncheon for ? " asked the man of his enthusiastic companion , the girl , as they entered a restaurant crowded with people who were holding glasses filled with liquids and ice and standing among tables already set up for dining . " This is a luncheon for people who have been in a movie , " said the girl . " There is Bruce Dern , there is Robert Mitchum , there is Martin Sheen , there is Paul Sorvino , " she said in one breath and pointing with her chin . " There is Stacy Keach , " said the man , pointing with a finger . " There is your finger falling off and lying on the floor , " said the girl . " You must n't point . " " I like the waitresses , " said the man . " They favor bangs and short , blunt-cut hair ; dresses above their knees ; and boots that fall down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , " said the girl . " Martin Sheen has just beamed at that nice woman standing a step or two behind you , " said the man . " Martin Sheen is not as tall as I had expected , and yet he 's not short enough to be devastatingly appealing , " said the girl . " I see that we are being asked to sit down now , " said the man . " There are rolls on the table , " said the girl . " There are always rolls on the table , " said the man , " and nobody seems to eat them . When I find food just sitting on the top of a table somewhere , I wo n't eat it before washing it . " " Have you spoken to the man who has taken a large amount of his hair from the right side of his head and brushed it all the way over to the left side , only it wo n't quite lie still and so as you speak to him you are constantly tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time straighten his tie ? " asked the girl . " I have spoken to a man who writes exclusively about tennis and who grew up in Wilkes-Barre , " said the man . " A woman has mentioned interviewing Robert Mitchum , " said the girl , " and now I see him sitting over there , his lunch untouched in front of him . " " What are we eating ? " asked the man . " Chicken in lemon sauce with French fries and boiled beans , " said the girl . " I know , but what are we really eating ? " asked the man . " Bruce Dern takes each of his French fries , butters it thoroughly , and then eats it , " said the girl . " Bruce Dern has said he is the only man who has killed John Wayne , " said the man . " From where I am sitting , in my view is Stacy Keach , " said the girl . " I always feel that I should like what is in my view , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I wish the room were aglow , " said the man . " I wish I had a feeling of expansiveness and fulfillment and delight in small , unimportant things . I can not finish my chicken . " " I have noticed , " said the girl , " that whenever people want you to eat a strange sort of animal they immediately tell you that it tastes just like chicken . This chicken that you can not finish tastes just like chicken . "
