It was a dubious honor , even for the most hard-line of Communist nations . But after months of negotiations , North Korea , the xenophobic workers ' state run by Communist Leader Kim Il Sung , was publicly declared by capitalist bankers to be in default on its foreign debt . Reason : the Pyongyang government 's failure to make payments on $770 million in obligations to two syndicates representing 140 banks . Other countries in the past have halted payment of debt but struck deals with foreign lenders , earning more favorable terms and fresh credits . In North Korea 's case , says one European banker , " nobody in their right minds will now lend money to them . " <P> The default came after nine months of talks in London finally fizzled . North Korea has owed most of the money , which it used mainly to buy grain and heavy equipment and to build bridges and roads , since the early 1970s . The country has never repaid any principal ; indeed , on several occasions , it also suspended debt repayments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Western creditors . But for the past three years , Pyongyang has refused even to meet interest charges . For a time it looked as if the banks and the North Koreans might work out another agreement . The deal fell apart , however , when Pyongyang 's negotiators demanded $200 million in new credits and the banks broke off the talks . <P> The debt debacle could hardly come at a worse time for Pyongyang . Reports filtering back from visiting academics and investment experts depict a country mired in an economic morass . Although precise numbers are hard to obtain , the per capita gross national product for the nation 's 20 million people is believed to be $900 , far less than South Korea 's $2,274 . The North 's GNP rose last year by 1% to 4% , to about $20 billion , compared with a 12.5% increase , to about $95 billion , in the South . While South Korea pumps out Hyundai * automobiles and Daewoo computer equipment , some North Koreans drive trucks that burn wood for fuel and toil over equally outmoded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlikely to disappear anytime soon . Much of North Korea 's economic backwardness stems from the country 's imposing military buildup aimed at the prosperous South . Pyongyang is estimated to spend about 25% of its GNP annually on arms  --  one of the highest proportions in the world . One result : North Korea is so broke that even China and the Soviet Union , Kim 's two strongest military allies , have delayed oil shipments to the country because Pyongyang has been slow to pay its bills . Western observers also feel that North Korea 's plight will never improve so long as the Kim regime holds to its doctrine of Juche , an ideology of extreme self-reliance that basically rejects cooperation with foreigners . Juche is closely associated with Kim himself , who has ruled the country since 1948 . <P> The latest default could make life more austere in Kim 's kingdom . Lawyers representing the creditor banks are already scouting for North Korean assets to seize , including reserves believed to be stashed in bank accounts in Switzerland , Austria , West Germany and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intercept the shipments of gold , worth about $27 million each , that Pyongyang sells each month through the London bullion market . Juche , in other words , could encompass even harder times ahead .
