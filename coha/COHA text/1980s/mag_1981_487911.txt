" The facts are stark . " ! So says Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in his preface to the slick Pentagon propaganda brochure called " Soviet Military Power . " Stark , staring mad is more like it . And not MAD in the.sense of Mutual Assured Destruction , the deterrent theory that has kept the world from the ultimate blowup for three decades . Reagan &; Co. are abandoning MADness for plain madness as they edge toward the doctrine of a fightable , winnable nuclear war . Weinberger 's sales pitch is aimed at two principal targets . Congiess is the first ground zero , and it is growing stickier about- raising the money for a new generation of superweapons . The other bull's-eye is Europe , where the NATO countries are dubious about playing host to cruises , neutrons and Pershing 2s . So the idea is to prove once more that The Russians Are Coming : they have an " unending flow " of new hardware ; their capability for " projection of power " beyond their borders is mushrooming ; and they persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plank , by the way , in Reagan 's platform for America ) . Therefore we must outdo , outflank and overkill them , cost what it might and come what may . That means B-1 s and MXs , and devil take the hindmost European ally . To placate those nervous Nellies , Al Haig is playing the nice cop , chatting with Andrei Gromyko desultorily , while Cap Weinberger acts the tough role . An empty gesture toward multilateral arms control aims to Lr counter Europe 's growing interest in unilateral disarmament . The allies wo n't buy tickets to this old charade . Neither will the Russians be there . But the - acting President , directing this melodrama , goes on buying hideously expensive props for a show turning to tragedy . HIROSHIMA AND MODERN MEMORY MARTIN J.

Truman , January 7 , 1947 Thirty-six years after atomic bombs destrbyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki , every RAD ( Reagan Administration ?

Two recent publications , " Hiroshima : A Soldier 's View , " an article by Paul Fussell featured on the cover of the August 22-29 issue of The New Republic , and a book , Hiroshima and Nagasaki : The Physical , Medical , and Social Effects of the Atomic Bombings ( Basic Books , 706 pp. , $37.50 ) , remind us of the political motives that inspire those debates and of the personal commitments that intrude on them . No one who looks closely at the arguments related to the atomic bombings will fail to recognize that there is more than a matter of military history at stake .

But power was not the only foundation for ( Continued on Page 349 ) O n August 11 , Jaime Castillo , president of Chile 's Human Rights Commission , and three other prominent human-rights leaders in that country were expelled . Castillo was roughed up by Chilean police , spirited by car to the Argentine border with the three others and forcibly evicted . The banishments took place-barely forty-eight hours after U.S. representative to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick concluded a visit to Chile see editorial , " Gross Violations , " The Nation , August 22-29 . Castillo , who is now living in exile in Venezuela , was in the United States in mid-September . In the course of a talk with him , we learned that the timing of his expulsion and Kirkpatrick 's stay in Chile was more than a coin- ' cidence . While in Chile , Kirkpatrick announced that the United States desired to " normalize " relations with Augusto Pinochet 's regime . She made it clear that Chile 's refusal to cooperate in the investigation of the 1976 Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moffitt , an associate of Letelier 's at the Institute for Policy Studies , by agents of the Chilean secret police was no obstacle to friendly ties . The Carter Administration had made an issue of the murders and cut off aid to Chile , among other measures , in November 1977 , after Chile refused to extradite Gen. Manuel Contreras , Col. Pedro Espinoza and Capt . Armando Fernandez , whom the U.S. government wanted to try for complicity in the killings , and failed to make a serious investigation of its own . Although these retaliatory measures were only halfheartedly enforced , relations with Chile were officially cool . President Ronald Reagan and his advisers , howeVer , announced their intention to abandon the Carter sanctions . Kirkpatrick was the first important Administration official to go to Chile and tell President Pinochet the good news . Despite the Pinochet government 's obstruction of any investigation of the Letelier-Moffitt murders , one Chilean has tenaciously pursued the case ? Jaime Castillo , acting as lawyer for the Letelier family . Castillo informed us that at the time of his expulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imminent . If the ruling was favorable to Castillo , an investigation of the murders would finally commence . If the court ruled against him , he would have five days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Chile . Either way , Castillo 's presence in Chile was essential because he is the only lawyer familiar with the record in the case , which now runs to fifteen volumes . His expulsion , therefore , served the interests of the Chilean officials who are protecting those who ordered the murders of Letelier and Moffitt . On September 18 , the same day that we talked with Castillo , the military court handed down its decision : no further investigation . Since Castillo was barred from returning to file an appeal , the case was in effect closed . Secretary of State Alexander Haig , , Kirkpatrick and other Reagan Administration officials speak of the determination of the United States to combat international terrorism , yet the Letelier-Moffitt murders were the most blatant example of international terrorism to take place within the United States . By normalizing relations with Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jaime Castillo was really fighting international terrorism . Now he is a man without a country . STATIC ON THE RIGHT We are not unaccustomed to being labeled " pro-Communist , " but we were perversely heartened to hear the charge again from Representative Larry McDonald , the Georgia John Bircher . The occasion was a speech by McDonald devoted mainly to an attack on , of all people , the ultra-right Liberty Lobby . The lobby , it seems , has been feuding with McDonald , and so he rose in high dudgeon to charge that it was in cahoots with " the strange leftist cult headed by Lyndon LaRouche " ? the United States Labor Party , that is  --  which , McDonald said , relies on " such pro-Communist sources as . . . the . National Lawyers Guild and The Nation . " Since McDonald is a Nation fan , he must recall the article by Frank Donner and Randall Rothenberg entitled " The Strange Odyssey of Lyndon LaRouche " The Nation , August 16-23 , 1980 , which described the U.S.L.P. 's rightward drift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that it represented another in a growing string of internecine squabbles in the Reagan new right-old right coalition . What with Bparry Goldwater , de- nouncing the Moral , Majority and Irving Kristol opposing the possible nomination of George Wallace supporter Melvin E. Bradford to the directorship of the National Endowment for the Humanities , each faction seems bent on purging the other . We wish them success . Sowell Brother ? T once heard Erik Erikson say that we are all our own grandmothers . I guess that 's so , because the strongest thing I ever heard my grandmother say about anyone was " He gets my goat , " and the strongest thing I can say in a popular magazine about Thomas Sowell is that he7 gets my goat . Now , to say that Sowell is unpopular among black moderates and liberals is to put the case in its mildest form . I do not believe Sowell 's unpopularity derives from his being a conservative or from a desire by blacks on the left to impose a firm orthodoxy on all black public figures . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1960s tended to look down on blacks who seemed interested only in making money and indifferent to what we were doing . I was one of those people . But I have lately come to understand that we need to accumulate wealth in the black community and to pass on financial skills to our children if we are to take our fight for justice to places beyond where the activists , the politicians and the writers can take it . Grandma used to say , " There are lots of paths for people to take . Let 's take them all . " I now agree . Secretary of Housing and Urban " Development Samuel Pierce Jr . is a conservative by my lights , and so , for that matter , is my friend Franklin Thomas , the president of the Ford Foundation . I am sure they do their work in good faith , and though they have chosen paths or methods I might not have chosen , I accept the Possibility that they are now doing more for the cause of equal justice than T have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . I hate to brand him ( or anyone ) an enemy to the interests of his people , but after reading him for many years , I find it hard to escape that conclusion . I have kept my silence about him because I could see no , vvinners in a fight between blacks other than the external enemies of our people . This spring , however , Sowell launched an all-out attack on black leaders on the opinion pages of The Washington Post . Among their sins , apparently , was having light skins . ( How this charge applies to the most prominent of those leaders , Vernon E. Jordan Jr. , I do not know . ) And then , in a recent edition of Newsweek , Sowell used Beethoven , apples , oranges , Willie Mays and Italians in Argentina to attack the notion that inequality of results usually suggests inequality of opportunity . I know that one of my , problems with Sowell is that his writing is murky and his line of reasoning hard to follow  --  sometimes it is even hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of unique individuals , it , who are not quantifiable abstractions . Thus , though two numbers can be compared , two human beings , Beethoven and Mays , for example , can not . In addition , Sowell argues that there are some societies in which , though the scales are tipped against them , despised minorities  --  expatriate Chinese in Asia or the Japanese in America  --  seem to thrive . Finally , he argues that American history does not support the notion that inequality of results strongly suggests inequality of opportunity . Inequality of results , in America , Sowell seems to conclude , flows from basic inequalities in human beings and nothing else . Well , that 's quite a thimbleful . And it 's baloney . Our history is at work in each and every one of us 4 ind in all of our institutions . The poor black children I see out of the window of the room where I am now working are in the city of Washington because their grandparents were , sharecroppers who were thrown off the land when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer needed . Their sharecropping ancestors , lived in semi-peonage because America refused to give even limited opportunity to all but a very few of the freed slaves and , I suppose , because some of the people who stayed on the land were dazzled by Southern paternalism , some were timid and , perhaps , some were not too bright . To suggest that the children I now see are not affected by history is as valid as saying that the earth is flat . And history works in another way too . The form that chattel slavery took in this country was one of the most brutal the world has ever known . All of the mechanisms of social control in the South , and some of them in the nation as a whole , were mobilized to extract mule-like labor and obedience from black people . The courts , the churches , the legislatures and the weight of custom were all employed to enforce submission and to reinforce the image of the black as a despised other . None of that stopped with Emancipation or the adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attitudes , codes of conduct and laws were handed down by white America through the generations . To argue that the crushing weight of a whole society 's hatred had no impact on the minds and spirits , of black people is about as silly as putting Mays and Beethoven in the same sentence . It is just as illogical as arguing , as Sowell does , that though Ludwig and Willie ca n't be compared , the experiences of Japanese-Americans and black Americans can be . Blacks have been battered by American society as no other people , and I can feel the scars of my slave great-grandmother on my soul . God knows what the children across the street feel . One would have to be a fool to argue that there ' have been no improvements since Emancipation . There have been enormous advances in my lifetime . Black children in Kansas City , Missouri , are no longer bused past new white schools to old , dilapidated , segregated ones , as I was when I was a child . A black man sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blacks sit on corporate boards and others make millions on basketball courts or baseball Vdiamonds . Blacks with money can walk without fear of -j humiliation into the best restaurants , hotels and theaters in this country . There has been change . But there is still racism ' in America . It is not past ; it is present and harmful . Large numbers of black inner-city youngsters still go to all black or predominantly black ( and inferior ) schools . The managers in almost all corporations are overwhelmingly white and male , and the people coming up the ladder behind them are the same . Blacks who penetrate the higher echelons of corporate life still encounter racial hostility . I did when I joined the editorial board of The New York Times in 1974 , and I have , since then , heard similar stories from others . A society that was bent and twisted out of shape in order to deny opportunity to minorities and to women ca n't be fixed by two and a half decades of vigorous protest , by laws and court decisions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pundits . The system is still substantially skewed , and so are the minds of a good number of white Americans  --  particularly males . So , when I see Labor Department statistics that tell me that 15 percent of all minorities are out of work , that 45.7 percent of all black teen-agers who want work ca n't get it and that women still earn less than 60 percent of what men make , I do not conclude that the sun spins around the earth and that these results flow from a society in which all opportunity is equal . - - Sowell , who believes that it is , seems to have arrived at this conclusion by examining the experiences of Italians in Argentina and explicitly ignoring the history and the current social conditions of America. - He has published nonsense . That is not to say that blacks ought not to be doing more for themselves . One of our most vexing problems is the distance that separates many of our economic , professional and civic leaders from our poor . Nor do I say that the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forces at the polls . Much more is required of a people trying to wrest equality from a hostile environment than we have been willing so far to give . In this quest , government can not be our salvation , but it must be our ally . And we surely need on our side the aroused consciences of all decent people in America who love this country 's principles . I conclude  --  really quite reluctantly  --  that a man like Thomas Sowell , who uses his powerful voice to destroy these two preconditions to freedom , is an enemy of the weakest and poorest of his brethren : ROGER WILKINS Roger Wilkins , a member of The Nation 's Editorial Board , is a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political Studies . Realism onWages " The , minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great Depression . " Ronald Reagan , January 1980 ike other forms of economic regulation , the minimum wage has been receiving a good deal of attention from conservative politicians and economists . The American Enterprise Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published a series of monographs critical of it and plans to publish a book on the subject later this year . Senator Orrin Hatch , Republican of Utah , chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee , has proposed , a two-tier minimum that would pay workers who are between 16 and 19 years old 75 percent of the minimum wage for the first six months of their , employment . Following the lead ' of President Ronald Reagan and the A.E.I. , Hatch claims his proposal will reduce unemployment among teen-agers by encouraging employers to hire more of them . The view that a subminimum wage for teen-agers would increase youth employment is no doubt grounded in the folksy vision of neighborhood barbershops and hardware stores suddenly hiring youngsters to sweep floors or stock shelves . But under current law only companies with sales in excess of $325,000 annually are covered by Federal minimum wage legislation , which means that most small neighborhood businesses are already exempt . In addition , businesses grossing more than $325,000 annually already have the option under Section 14 of the Fair Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the Department of Labor estimates that only 60 percent of authorized exemptions are used , which suggests that businesses- do not want to hire all the teen-agers they legally can . In 1979 , exemptions were authorized for about 700,000 workers ( 512,000 of whom were students ) . Many of the exemptions Were granted to eating and drinking establishments  --  particularly fast-food restaurantsi where three of every ten employees are teen-agers . A 1977 Department of Labor study of McDonald 's showed that while the company had received exemptions for 550,000 hours of work , it had utilized only 46 percent of Sits subminimum wage authorization . These facts certainly raise the question of whether Hatch 's proposed . youth wage differential would increase the number of teen-agers hired . Industry spokesmen do not seem to think it would . William Giery , executive secretary of the Foodservice and Lodging Institute , which represents McDonald 's , Burger King , Kentucky Fried Chicken and dozens of other multistate restaurant and hotel companies , told The Washington Post , " Because of market conditions and our hope to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got the differential , we 'd have something we could n't use . " Don White , vice president of the American Retail Federation , is skeptical that a subminimum wage would lead business to hire unemployed teen-agers : " There has been no indication from my industry that they are willing , ready and able to hire these kids under the provisions of the Hatch bill . " The conservative attack on the minimum wage , like the plan for the two-tier minimum , comes from the maxims of economics textbooks . Textbook theory argues that as more workers are hired , the contribution of each additional worker  --  his or her " marginal product " ? diMinishes . This is the famous law of diminishing returns . The theory concludes that there are only two ways to increase employment : either increase the productivity of workers or " convince " them to work for lower wages . Accordingly , anything that interferes with lowering wages " creates " unemployment One might wonder about the wisdom of a proposal based primarily on simplified textbook models , but let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plant in use " generally varies with employment ; in other words , additional workers use ' previously unused machines to produce more goods . Consequently , there is no reason to assume diminishing returns and no reason that wages must di-op in order to increase employment . In particular , there is little evidence to suggest that a subminirnum wage for teen-agers would decrease teen-age unemployment . But could conservatives be right in claiming that by going further and removing the minimum wage entirely , labor costs would be reduced , more jobs would be created and unemployment would decline ? The answer , to quote Sam Goldwyn , is a " definite maybe . " What would happen if the minimum wage were reduced ? Wage rates are related to one another , and the minimum wage provides a floor to the wage structure . When the floor drops , it is reasonable to expect other wages to go down with it ? . Labor costs would certainly decline , which might please some employers . However , if wages drop , so would the ability of consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on what happens to demand . If the decline in demand were replaced by an increased demand for exports or by investment demand , employment would not suffer and might even increase . But if the drop in demand were not somehow replaced , the employment effect would be difficult to predict . What is clear is that reducing the minimum wage is part of a program for reducing wages altogether , and there is no reason to assume that it has anything to do with increasing employment . The minimum wage in the United States is already very low , hovering somewhere below half the average wage in manufacturing . At $3.35 an hour ; it is worth a penny less than it was five years ago and almost a dime less than it was in 1968 . But this decline in wages for low-wage workers has not improved their employment situation as the textbook theory predicts it should have . The burden of proving that the unemployment problems of these workers result from the existence of the minimum wage rests squarely on the shoulders of conservatives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current debate over the minimum wage . The real issue is the Reagan Administration 's program ( supported by a Republican Senate ) to redistribute income to the wealthy , to 41 weaken organized labor and to reduce the living standards of working people . The attack on the minimum wage fits neatly into this prOgram . POPULAR ECONOMICS RESEARCH GROUP The P.E.R . G. is a collection of socialist economists writing out of the Amherst , Massachusetts , area . As the leaves begin to fall , I still ca n't seem to erase from my mind the picture of Ronald Reagan at a reception for mayors in June greeting his own Secretary of Housing and Urban Development by saying , " How are you , Mr. Mayor ? How are things in your city ? " I realize that most of my brethren m the - Washington commentary corps have moved on to other matters by now , although the incident was mentioned by Andy Logan in The New Yorker not long ago and was used by Newsweek recently as an example of why people in Washington are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls " disengaged " ? a use of the word that conjures up phrases like " she 's really . more than a disengaged blonde " or " it was nothing but disengaged luck . " For most of the summer , I was hoping that some witness would come forward to record for history the Secretary 's response . I still have no way of knowing whether he replied in. a straightforward way ( " I am not , in fact , a mayor , Mr. President , but Samuel R. Pierce Jr. , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development " ) or muttered something sarcastic ( " Oh , things in my city are just fine , Mr. President . Most Federal agencies are in the hands of loonies , of course , and the President does n't recognize his own Cabinet secretaries , but otherwise things are just dandy " ) or simply panicked ( " Jesus God ! Let me out of here ! " ) or played along as if the whole thing were just one in a series of joke greetings that folks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not busy salvaging the economy by figuring out ways for rich people to depreciate their Jaguars ( " Nice to see you , Count . How 's the Countess ? Did you ever get that little plumbing problem at the castle attended to ? " ) I also have no way of checking the accuracy of a number of unverified explanations of the incident that surfaced during the summer  --  particularly concerning what Andy Logan 's piece referred to as " the dangerous implication that to the current President all blacks look alike . " I can not , for instance , verify the story that the President in his Hollywood days got his shoes shined ' regularly . by a locally renowned black man known to his customers as " the mayor of Pico Boulevard . " I was told by another source that the Los Angeles man in question was not black , that he was the President 's tailor rather than his shoeshine man , that he was not called mayor but named Myer , and that he was the man for whom the President mistook Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry ( " Fine , thank you , Mr. President , but I am not your tailor . I am the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , and am therefore not in a position to say whether a little taking in across the back would be advisable or not " ) . Maybe the President did greet Treasury Secretary Donald Regan recently by saying , " Another round of Pabst , Paddy , and some potato chips while you 're at it , " and maybe he did n't . I have resisted the theory that the President has trouble telling black people apart because the only black person he knows is Sammy Davis Jr . It is true that the Reagan people are always going on about how black people can pull themselves up by their own bootstraps without such Federal extravagances as a hot school lunch , but I 'm not convinced that such talk was necessarily inspired by the fact that Sammy Davis Jr. , in his early days as a maniacally energetic performer with the Will Mastin Trio , was literally able to pull himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance on his elbows and rendering " Lady of Spain " in the manner of James Cagney . Just as I was beginning to stop worrying about the implications of this country having as Deputy Secretary of State a man who could not call off the name of the Prime Minister of South Africa , I had to grapple with the fact that we have a President who might not be able to call off the name of the Deputy Secretary of State . Then , suddenly , the economic summit meeting in Canada was on , and I could imagine President Reagan sweeping into the lobby of that old resort hotel they used , his entourage around him and his briefer at his left elbow . " That fellow over there , " Reagan says to his briefer , indicating a man who is trying without success to hide behind a potted palm . " Is n't that the old duffer who 's always dozing off during National Security Council meetings ? The one who tried to get me to invest the Highway Trust money in ' that shrimp-boat tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the briefer whispers to the President . " Director of the Central Intelligence Agency . " Reagan stops in front of a uniformed man , hands him a $5 bill , , and says , " Just have the luggage sent up to the room . " " I am the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Mr. President , " the uniforined man says . " We are not allowed to accept gratuities . " The President smiles and extends his hand to the Japanese gentleman approaching him . " Great to see you , " he says . " Some beef teriyaki and fried rice this time . I do n't like that raw fish . " " You 're speaking to the Prime Minister of Japan , " the briefer hisses into Reagan 's ear . " Well , why did n't you say so , Ed ? " " Mike , sir . I 'm Mike . " The end of my summer was not made more ' relaxing by those stories about how carefully the President has to be briefed if he is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , I keep imagining Reagan preparing for , a meeting of his own Cabinet  --  patiently absorbing his briefing while remaining motionless so that Murray Weidenbaum can make-measurements for taking in his jacket across the back a bit . " The wonky one 's Stockman , " the briefer is saying . " The one in the toga is Haig . . . " When the Cabinet members show up , all of them are wearing the sort of name tags that are used at sales conventions : " Hi ! My name is Malcolm Baldrige ! I 'm the Secretary of Commerce ! Glad to meetcha ! "
