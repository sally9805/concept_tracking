In the end , it was no contest . The Pope kept pointing to the fine print , and the Jesuits , to a man , accepted the inevitable . Ignatius of Loyola had committed them 442 years earlier . The first Jesuit and the men he gathered round him spelled it out in the Formula of the Institute of the Society of Jesus : " We are obliged by a special vow to carry out whatever the present and future Roman Pontiffs may order which pertains to the progress of souls and the propagation of the faith ; and to go without hesitation or excuse , as far as in us lies . " That is the vow every Jesuit has taken for more than four centuries . And last February , Pope John Paul II summoned Jesuit leaders from all over the world to an unprecedented conclave to remind them of the fine print . He used those words and twenty-five other references in church documents to the Jesuit obligation of obedience to the Pope . Never before had a Pope called such a meeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-flung , most intellectual battalion , the Society of Jesus . The core of Jesuit discipline is obedience to the Pope , and what John Paul II gave the Jesuits was a stern lecture on history . The lesson was not lost on the eighty-six Jesuit provincials , priests who head the order ' s provinces , and two dozen other top Jesuits who sat through the Pope ' s carefully crafted speech at a villa outside Rome . Their order had been brought up short , and by the one man who could do it . If they and the priests under them wanted to remain the Pope ' s commandos , part of the thin black line that spans geography and history , they would have to " go without hesitation or excuse " in the direction pointed out by the Pope . John Paul II wants the Jesuits to engage in less political and social activism , more spiritual and soul-saving work . It amounts to a massive realignment of the church ' s most aggressive body of troops . " Because of the exigencies of your vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality of my ministry , it could not be otherwise . " That was that . After the Jesuit leaders left their meeting with the Pope and digested what had happened to their individual aspirations and their way of life , they fanned out from Rome , back to their universities and hospitals , their schools and their grass huts , to outposts of Christendom that span the globe . Their role in the church , their role in the modern world , had just been changed - made narrower by the Pope ' s strictures against Jesuits ' taking an active role in politics and worldly affairs and made deeper in terms of adherence to orthodox thought and obedience to churchly authority . Nothing like it had ever happened before : It was a full-dress dressing down from the top , all the company commanders getting the word from the commander in chief . And if the current population of Jesuits and their lineal descendants in the future take the Pope ' s words to heart , nothing like it will happen again . One man quelled a revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have the imprimatur of an earlier Pope , John XXIII , and the Second Vatican Council . In the words of one American Jesuit who works in Rome , Pope John Paul II " blew the whistle " on the Jesuits . Whether he was right in what he did , only history will decide . Whether that decision expands or diminishes the Jesuits ' role , whether it helps or hurts the church in the maelstrom of world politics and opinion , whether it expands or contracts the Jesuits ' alreadyshrinking numbers - all this remains to be seen . Some of the most brilliant and dedicated of the world ' s Catholics have taken the vows of the Society of Jesus . Whether the Pope ' s decision persuades them to stay or to go , as they wrestle with their individual commitments in the dark nights that the faithful experience , time alone will show . The church moves at a glacial pace . After nearly two thousand years , time seems to be on its side. - AJesuit who lives and works at the Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is not an Italian Pope . It is very important to know that . . . . What he ' s thinking is very difficult to say . He is doing his job very quietly . We have a new Pope here - new in all the meanings of the word . " In an institution that has survived for two millennia , the word " new " can have terrifying implications . John Paul II represents a break with many Catholic and papal traditions . Trained as an actor and playwright , he is skilled in the arts of manip-ulating symbols , of using television . He is a media man , the first media Pope . He comes from Poland , a Communist country ; he is not a creature of Rome . He is still something of an outsider to the Curia , that complex , conservative network of bureaucrats who serve and sometimes dominate Popes and act as executive branch , legislature , and judiciary , all rolled into one huge , mysterious apparatus . John Paul II is trying to get priests out of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papacy , out of politics . This Pope can not be above politics . He is the most political Pope of modern times . He has had a day-to- day involvement in Polish affairs since martial law was imposed , and his scheduled trip to his homeland this summer was the subject of intense negotiations with Communist authorities . During a three-week period in May and June , he visited Britain , Scotland , Argentina , and Switzerland ; he hosted President Ronald Reagan in Rome . There is little the Pope can do in worldly affairs that does not involve politics . Yet he has decided that priests , if not the church , if not the papacy , must veer away from political involvement . The Pope ' s move against the Jesuits may have been delayed by the attempt on his life on May 13 , 1981 . The Pontiff had been speaking out against activist priests for a year or more by then , but the move to rein in the Jesuits had to wait until October of last year . Last August 7 , the Jesuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gondra , 74 , suffered a stroke . A frail , ascetic Basque who had spent a lifetime traveling the globe in the service of his order , Arrupe was stationed in Japan when the United States dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima . His Jesuit seminary on the outskirts of the city was turned into a hospital to save some of the casualties . Arrupe took what some church leaders felt was too soft a line on Communism and socialism . " Many views of the Marxists are mistaken and dangerous , " Arrupe said in 1979 , " but it is no less true that they are often inspired by a profound sense of the injustices they want to combat . " A widely beloved figure among the Jesuits , Arrupe was left speechless and partially paralyzed by his stroke . He designated one of his top aides , the Reverend Vincent T. O ' Keefe , an American from Fordham University , as vicar general ; he would run the day-to-day affairs of the order . Although no American has ever headed the society , some Jesuits thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrupe eventually. - In October , the Pope sent his secretary of state , Agostino Cardinal Casaroli , to visit the recuperating Arrupe . The message he brought was that the Pope , for the first time in the Jesuits ' history , was installing his own man to run the order . The Pope ' s delegate was the Reverend Paolo Dezza , an 80- year-old , partially blind Jesuit who had been confessor and confidant to two earlier Popes . The Jesuits , both in Rome and in the field , were shocked . As one American Jesuit put it , " Vinnie O ' Keefe had been made acting general by Arrupe and had been doing a good job . Then the Pope puts us under an embargo ( temporarily refusing to authorize a Jesuit convocation to select a new superior general* and puts in an 80-year-old guy . American Jesuits kind of resented that . " The Reverend Robert Graham , a Jesuit from California , now in his 70s , who works in Rome on the staff of a Jesuit magazine , La Civilta Cattolica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ' Keefe had ambitions for the job , " he says . " Vinnie never took it that he had been exalted . " Dezza , the first man installed by a Pope to keep a wary eye on the Jesuits , wasted no time saying what John Paul II thought was wrong with the freewheeling style of Jesuits around the world . Jesuit leaders in Rome told him their side of the story . This exchange paved the way for the eight-day conclave in Rome that culminated in the Pope ' s speech on February 27 . After attending mass , the 110 Jesuit leaders went to meet the Pope . He kept them waiting for an hour , then read them a long , carefully worded statement . After the preliminary greetings , the Pope let them know where he stood . " It is well known that after the very dear Father Arrupe had been stricken by illness , " he read , " I deemed it opportune to appoint my personal delegate , and his coadjutor , for the government of the Order and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular and exceptional , suggested an intervention , a trial , ' which , and I say it with deep emotion , were received by the members of the Order in a genuinely Ignatian spirit . " John Paul II went on to praise the Jesuits as " valiant and devoted sons " of the church . " Popes have trusted them in the past , " he said , " and the Pope wishes to place his trust in them in the future . " Then there was a warning : " Where there is fidelity , there is no room for deviations which are certainly harmful to the vitality of communities and of the entire church . " The Jesuits should " convince those who are tempted , alas , by the ways of either progressivism or integralism ( the Pope did not define those terms to return with humility and joy to unsullied communion with their pastors and brothers who suffer from their attitudes and their absence . . . . It must not be forgotten that this necessary concern for justice must be exercised in conformity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted a passage from a speech he had given in 1980 in Rio de Janeiro : " This ( religious vocation* must be even more emphasized in our times against the many tendencies to secularize the priest ' s work by reducing it to a purely philanthropic function . He is not a medical doctor , a social worker , a politician , or a trade unionist . . . . Certainly , whenever there is need , he must also give material assistance through works of charity and by upholding justice , but as I have said , in the last analysis , this must be a secondary service which must never obscure the principal service , which is to help souls discover the Father . " - That was the heart of the Pope ' s five-thousand-word speech . He did not say he did not trust the Jesuits - just that Popes have trusted them before and that he wanted to be able to trust them again . When the Jesuit leaders retired to hash over the Pope ' s message , there was a lot of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was obviously a call to the wayward brethren among the Jesuits to return to a narrower definition of their role . In Rome the Pope gave the Jesuits formal permission to convoke their general congregation , the principal purpose of which will be to choose a successor to Arrupe . Plans for this meeting are already under way . Nearly 250 Jesuits from the provinces around the world will meet to select a new leader , under the guidelines set by the Pope . It is in the exercise and interpretation of the guidelines laid down in Rome that the impact of the Pope ' s crackdown will be felt . The " no priests in politics " rule has been interpreted by some to refer only to electoral politics : There will be no Jesuits in Congress or state legislatures or running for mayor . The political ban becomes muchharder to apply in places like Central America , where Jesuits and other Catholic clergy have become active on behalf of the poor , the disposessed , the oppressed . Some of them may have to wrestle with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the confines of the order . The 241 Jesuits in Central America , caught between ministering to the masses of the poor and the strictures of often repressive governments , will have to do a lot of soul-searching in light of the Pope ' s stance . " In Latin America , feelings were running against the society , " said the Reverend Jean-Claude Dietsch , director of information for the Society of Jesus in Rome . " Now , after the Pope ' s speech , things are very good for the society there . " While the Pope ' s message may be open to differing interpretations elsewhere , the line in Central America is clearly drawn . Dietsch says , " The Provincials know that , in Central America , it will be necessary to speak to the Vatican " before approving an individual Jesuit ' s project or policies. - In retrospect , the Pope may have been conducting a dry run of the crackdown on the Jesuits when he ordered the Reverend Robert Drinan , a Jesuit , to leave the US House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate in Massachusetts in 1970 , Drinan was highly visible as he attempted to impeach Richard Nixon , denounced the Vietnam War and the secret bombing of Cambodia , and belabored conservative interests over civil rights , immigration , and social policies . Drinan angered many more conservative Catholics . His refusal to place opposition to abortion at the center of his political career caused many Catholic lay people and priests in the right-to-life movement to complain to church authorities . They argued that Drinan served as a kind of symbolic shield for many moderate Catholic politicians , who could hide behind his name , claiming not all Catholic leaders felt strongly about abortion . It is impossible to say how much influence the right-to-life lobby had with the Pope , but no faction reacted with more joy when the only priest in Congress was unhorsed . Drinan accepted the Pope ' s decision without complaint or rancor , serving out his fifth term , which ended in 1980 . Drinan still lives in the Jesuit community in Washington , and he remains active in non-electoral politics as head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesuits were pleased that Drinan went quietly . Graham , himself a conservative , has high praise for Drinan ' s compliance with the Pope ' s order . " Bob is a great sport , and he did honor to himself and the New England Province , " he says . " He ' s a born politician , God bless him , and very conscientious , " Graham continues . " The Lord made him that way . He counts for more in church circles now . He has no identity crisis . When the word came down , that was enough . He ' s a priest and a Jesuit . When you ' re a politician , you have to roll logs . When a priest gets into it , it ' s a bad situation . " Dietsch , speaking for the Jesuits , says , " The case of Father Drinan was very clear " : There were many people qualified to represent Drinan ' s congressional district - it was not a question of one Jesuit filling a unique and essential role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Dietsch . The Pope ' s order " was not against the church , or Father Drinan . " And it was not just within the ranks of the Jesuits that Drinan ' s decision occasioned a sigh of relief . " The Pope , " says a Jesuit familiar with the infighting that preceded the papal order , " was very happy at the resignation of Father Drinan. " - The Jesuit provincials who left Rome after the Pope ' s lecture in February were also relieved , if chastened , in Graham ' s view . " It was much ado about nothing , or else only a normal family squabble . Everything seems to be quiet now , " he says . " All of them went home quite pleased with themselves , the tension has all disappeared . The Pope ' s man ( Dezza* is very diplomatic . He rubbed them all the right way . The ball bounces in funny ways . There ' s a big sigh of relief here . I think they all went back to the States quite relieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated . The Pope said , That ' s enough , get down from your horse . ' " Graham says the Jesuits have traditionally left their members " a wide margin of personal initiative . " To impose rules on an organization that draws men of many nationalities to work in many countries around the world is a considerable task . Papal authority over the Jesuits is " the obverse side of the freedom of initiative , " says Graham . The activist trend of Catholic priests and nuns in Central America worries the central authorities in Rome . Graham calls the activist clergy , those who identify with the poor and oppressed , " the red-hots . " In Latin America , he says , " The red-hots , the Jesuits , the Maryknollers , the sisters , too , are in with the guerrillas . I don ' t think a priest should go around with a submachine gun . " The church ' s liberation movement in South and Central America is a thorny topic in Rome . " With the liberation movement , " says Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atrocities ; they rise up , outraged . So there , well-intentioned nuns and Jesuits throw their hearts into it . Here in Rome they say , Uh-oh , it ' s up to us to slow you down . ' At the top level , they might say , We ' re unhappy with complete political involvement . ' " Graham sees the pope ' s crackdown as a reaction to the Jesuits ' activities . " The Jesuits were pulled in because of the initiatives they ' ve engaged in since Vatican II , when the previous norms were repealed , over the last fifteen years , " he says . " This meeting here - I think it was a great educational experience . When the pope blows the whistle , they get a little unhappy , but they simmer down , when they get home , and pass the word that they ' re OK in Rome , but we have to keep in mind our identities . ' We ' ve had our own number of oddballs , of course . We threw out homosexuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd ideas , out they go . We are an organization - that ' s what gives us strength , like a fighting unit , even . " Graham is unsure whether the pope ' s actions will hurt recruiting for the order . " We dropped a lot , we ' re down from our peak , but we ' re dynamic , we ' re not moribund . There ' s a dynamism in the order which is exciting , really . But you can ' t have everybody going off on their own views . It ' s been all for the good . I ' m optimistic . " - The Jesuits ' general congregation will probably not take place until late in 1983 . The provincials plus two more elected delegates from each province , about 250 delegates in all , will gather to elect a successor to Arrupe and conduct other business . How will they interpret the pope ' s wishes ? " It is very difficult to say , " says Dietsch . " We will have to wait some months to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they have to explain these things . . . . Practically speaking , it is very important for us to have a general congregation . It is very difficult for people not in the society to understand our way of proceeding . . . . the pope is asking for the society to be - more Jesuits . It is useful for the society to be involved where John Paul II gave us a mission . We are priests , we are religious . It is very important not to do the jobs of the laity . " In countries where laymen are available to do the jobs that some Jesuits have been performing , priests will be asked to step back . " In India or Africa , it is not the same problem . The pope said it was necessary to see country by country . It is difficult to have one policy for the whole world . It is difficult for the pope to get to know twenty-six thousand people throughout the world . It is necessary to speak to the Vatican about each person . Appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too soon to predict whether the pope ' s edict will reduce the number of new Jesuits joining the order . The society is now down to 26,000 members ; seventeen years ago there were 36,000 Jesuits . It will be " three or four years , " says Dietsch , before any impact on recruiting and retention of Jesuits can be discerned . " Many young people are happy to be in the society , but it is necessary to wait a bit before the answer will be known . " The Jesuits are not the only Catholic order losing manpower . In the United States alone , a recent survey found , there are only 11,500 seminarians in all orders , down from 48,000 only sixteen years ago . Another survey suggests that within eighteen years there will only be 25,000 Catholic priests in the country , compared with 58,000 today . Any substantial drop in the number of Jesuits joining or staying in the order will affect the vast Jesuit educational apparatus in the United States . In this country , Jesuits staff forty-seven high schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 712 Jesuits educates more than 21,000 students at Boston College , Holy Cross , and Fairfield University - and educate more than 2300 high school students in Boston , Fall River , and Portland , Maine . Boston College , with 11,000 full-time students , is the nation ' s largest Catholic university . Its president , the Reverend J. Donald Monan , received one of the highest honors in American education in June when Harvard awarded him an honorary degree , citing him for " the philosopher ' s dedication to truth and goodness . " Worldwide , the society ' s 1980 Atlas listed 27,027 Jesuits in 83 countries , including a " province in dispersion " in the Far East . It carried a grim footnote concerning the fate of some whose whereabouts and welfare are unknown : " There are also some 89 Chinese Jesuits reported to be still alive on the Mainland . " The society ' s 1982 Yearbook says of the Jesuits in China , " We do not have definite knowledge of more than few of them . " At the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were in the United States - a decline of 255 from the previous year . About 20,000 of the total number are priests ; the rest are seminarians , who are studying to be priests , or brothers , who are not ordained priests . About one of every 20 Catholic priests in the world is a Jesuit . What the pope ' s intervention in the affairs of the order means for American Jesuits is still being sorted out . A Jesuit at the Vatican , who did not wish to be identified , says , " The pope is very happy with the Jesuits ' role in education in the United States . Beyond that ? Who knows ? " He suggested the pope is less than happy with some Jesuit activities in the United States but would not specify them . Dietsch says that for American Jesuits the changes will come more in spiritual practices , not so much in specific rules of conduct : " Change in the United States ? Perhaps about spirituality , yes , but not about legislation about how they work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiritual way , not in a legislative way . " Graham is not perturbed by recent speculation in the press on how the Pope ' s wariness about the Jesuits will affect their role in America . " Oftentimes , people back home think they know the issue . The Jesuits catch people ' s imagination . It ' s like writing about the Masons or the Jews . Well , that ' s all right . " - The Jesuits bowed , and the Pope won . Popes always win . But this Pope has a place on the world stage that transcends his role in the church . In the eyes of the world ' s non-Catholics , who weigh his words on questions of injustice , the arms race , abortion , birth control , the population explosion , permissiveness , totalitarianism , John Paul II is being judged from outside the faith as well . The American Jesuits who left Rome after the Pope ' s hour-long lecture did not slink away . The US Jesuit Conference issued a statement saying it would heed the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " commitment to the service of faith , " but they also affirmed what they called " its concomitant , the promotion of justice . " If the Jesuits were a breed that tended to lay down their swords at the first sign of reprimand , they would not have lasted for four centuries . Nobody breaks the spirit of 26,000 aggressive and intellectual men with religious vocations overnight . They will be heard from , one way or another . Their discipline is fearsome . It has not been demonstrated with any more painful clarity than it was the day the Reverend Robert Drinan bowed to the Pope ' s dismissing him from Congress : " I am doing this because I am a priest , " said Drinan . " I ' ll always be a priest . I will be a priest until I die . . . . As a person of faith , I must believe that there is work for me to do that somehow will be more important than the work I am required to leave . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
