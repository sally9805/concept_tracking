Whose adaptability makes him Reagan 's man for all reasons <P> In a West Wing office of Richard Nixon 's White House there was an audacious wall decoration : a large photograph of a broadly smiling Ronald Reagan , who had challenged Nixon for the 1968 G.O.P. nomination . Moreover , the occupant of the office , Nixon 's director of the Office of Management and Budget , often proudly pointed to both Reagan 's grin and the handwritten inscription under it : " The smile is for real , thanks to you . In friendship and warm regards , Ron . " Said the OMB boss to one visitor : " Now , there is a man who really knows how to cut budgets . " <P> That longstanding mutual admiration is a prime reason why the President-elect last week named Caspar Willard Weinberger , 63 , to be Secretary of Defense . To some officials in Washington , " Cap the Knife " seemed an odd choice . The expenditure-cutting ax he wielded so zestfully first for Reagan in California and then for Nixon in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans a huge military buildup . Moreover , Weinberger 's firsthand knowledge of weapons and military strategy apparently is confined to whatever he picked up poring over Defense Department budgets eight to ten years ago ; his current views on those subjects will remain among Washington 's best-kept secrets until his confirmation hearings begin next month . <P> Weinberger is a team player and loyalist who through long association has won Reagan 's absolute trust . Those qualities are important in any President 's Cabinet ; in Reagan 's they loom as vital . In addition , Weinberger will probably be the only Cabinet member who was part of Reagan 's cabinet in California , where Reagan governed largely through an executive committee of senior officers , just as he intends to do in Washington . <P> Weinberger , in a Washington Post article two weeks ago , argued vehemently that the management technique would work in the White House . Past Administrations ran into difficulties , he wrote , largely because Presidents " in effect did not trust the people they appointed " to their Cabinets , and therefore relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line . " In contrast , he asserted , Reagan 's Cabinet officers would be " advocates of the Administration 's policies to their departments , " rather than vice versa . According to Weinberger , the officers would give uninhibited advice to the President . But once a decision had been reached , they would carry it out " regardless of the blandishments of special interests or the threats of congressional committee staffs or the desire for individual prominence or the fun of being referred to as an ' independent maverick . ' " <P> The Defense Secretary-designate might have been writing a description of himself . His long service to Reagan made it inevitable that he would wind up in the Cabinet , and he was considered for several jobs , including Treasury and State . He got Defense primarily because , said an adviser , " the President-elect has plenty of strategists . What he needs at Defense is someone who will run the place . "
