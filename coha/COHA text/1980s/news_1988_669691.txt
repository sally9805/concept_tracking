Every week , millions of people tune into television programs that reenact crimes and encourage viewers to call in leads . The success of these programs , both in ratings and in catching fugitives , is making television as prized a vehicle for law enforcement as a squad car. // ' ' The FBI loves television , ' ' observes Milt Alerich , assistant director at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. // // Last week , independent stations across the country aired ' ' Manhunt , ' ' a two-hour special about the so-called Green River serial killer , who is suspected of murdering 50 people around Seattle between 1982 and ' 84 . Police suspect he then moved to San Diego , and is responsible for another 30 murders there in the last two years. // With no leads and a rising death count , police turned to television . In the first 36 hours after the show aired last Wednesday , more than 75 , 000 people called the toll-free hotline to give their tips. // ' ' It ' s too early to tell if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LBS Communications , which syndicated the program . But the detectives involved in the case ' ' feel they have a lot of credible leads , ' ' she says. // Detectives are hoping that enough tips from a particular location will lead them to the killer , who may be anywhere in the country . In the next few months , if the Green River killer is still at large , LBS will try again with a followup show. // Next fall , ' ' Manhunt ' ' will become an hour-long weekly program . Then it will join the quickly bulging ranks of crime-watch television programs , which have landed regular spots on the Fox television network , NBC , and local stations around the country. // To date , these programs have garnered relatively little criticism from civil libertarians . Some concern has been expressed , however , over the shows ' impact on jury trials and the possibility of mistaken identity. // The popularity of these shows has surprised TV executives who watch the ratings , but not sociologists who watch the American public. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' says Steven Barkan , chairman of the sociology department at the University of Maine . ' ' These TV shows are part of that phenomenon. ' ' // More than that , ' ' the American public is fed up with the level of violence ' ' in the country , says John Walsh , host of ' ' America ' s Most Wanted . ' ' The show lets people ' ' take an active role , and feel they can do something about it , ' ' he says. // ' In seventh heaven ' // Initially law enforcement agencies were skittish about working with television , concerned that the crimes would be portrayed inaccurately or sensationally , says Mr. Alerich at the FBI. // ' ' There was vigorous debate ' ' about how far the bureau should jump in , he says . But when FBI investigators saw the viewer response , ' ' case agents started calling me and saying , ' I want to get my fugitive on the show , ' ' ' he says. // The reason is simple : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what were considered dead-end cases . Fox television ' s ' ' America ' s Most Wanted , ' ' which has been on air the longest , has profiled 114 fugitives since the first show in February . Of those , 33 of them - or 25 percent - have been captured as a direct result of tips generated by the show , according to Fox and FBI statistics. // The show brought new hope to John Johnson , a detective at the Livingston County Sheriff ' s Department in Pontiac , Ill . Several weeks ago , ' ' America ' s Most Wanted ' ' profiled Joe Sinnott Edwards , a young man who killed his adoptive parents in Illinois in 1983 . Mr. Johnson had run out of leads . ' ' In a five-year-old case , the smoking gun quits smoking , ' ' he says. // Last March , Johnson tried to sell his case to television . Like dozens of other frustrated officers in local , state , and federal law-enforcement agencies who want the TV lightning to strike , he was put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going to do this show , I was in seventh heaven , ' ' he said recently , standing in the wings of the Fox set as the show was about to air . Normally , ' ' we send out 100 or 200 ' Wanted ' posters ' ' with the picture of a fugitive , he said . But with television , ' ' in one night , we get millions of people to see his face. ' ' // Seconds after the Joe Edwards profile ended , the phone banks in the Fox studio lit up and swamped the 30 operators taking tips from viewers . Interviewed by phone last week , Johnson said of the 500 tips he received from callers , none led to Edwards . But , he added , the show yielded ' ' very valuable information ' ' that gave the trail a new scent. // A year ago , ' ' America ' s Most Wanted ' ' became the first weekly show of this ilk to air in all the major markets . About 18 million people tune in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , says executive producer Michael Linder . The show regularly squeezes ahead of NBC and ABC in the ratings on Sunday nights. // That has spurred a new genre in television entertainment. // NBC , for example , started up ' ' Unsolved Mysteries ' ' in October , turning what had been an occasional special program into a weekly show . Like its Fox rival , ' ' Unsolved Mysteries ' ' works closely with the FBI , US Marshals Service , the Drug Enforcement Administration , and local police . Unlike ' ' America ' s Most Wanted , ' ' it touches on noncriminal subjects like UFOs and missing persons. // Last month ABC aired ' ' Track Down , ' ' a test program featuring unsolved crimes and a hotline for the public to relay its leads . ABC has not decided whether to make it a regular series. // Local stations are running their own shows , and there will be more than a dozen similar programs being marketed by syndicators this year. // A few , muted objections // To date , civil libertarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major concern , says Colleen O ' Connor at the American Civil Liberties Union , is the ' ' venue question ' ' - that is , whether a suspect can get a fair trial if jury members have seen his or her face on television. // Counters Alerich at the FBI , ' ' it ' s highly unlikely that you can ' t find people who haven ' t seen America ' s Most Wanted , ' ' enough to fill a 12-member jury. // Mistaken identity is the other main stumbling block. // Take the case of David Paulin , a free-lance writer in Frederick , Md . About a year ago , Mr. Paulin received a visit from the FBI . A neighbor had identified Paulin , who recently related his story in the op-ed pages of the New York Times , as resembling the suspect whose crimes were reenacted the previous night on NBC ' s ' ' Unsolved Mysteries. ' ' // The interrogation took just a half-hour , but left Paulin ' ' rattled ' ' and wary of television crime shows. // Wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to safeguard innocent look-alikes , says Mr. Linder at Fox. // For example , each week the show is videotaped by all of the FBI offices around the country . In the closing credits , the fugitive ' s 10-digit fingerprint code is shown on the screen. // When an FBI agent follows up a lead by calling on someone , the agent can compare the person ' s fingerprint with the fugitive ' s code . That doesn ' t doesn ' t eliminate the hassle , but does eliminate wrongful arrest , Linder says. // //
