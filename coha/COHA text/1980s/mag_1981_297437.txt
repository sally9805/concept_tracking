A Defense Department portrait of Soviet military might <P> " There is a very real and growing threat . It is not scare talk or any kind of propaganda . " With that dire warning , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger last week released a glossy , 99-page report titled Soviet Military Power . The study , illustrated with maps and photographs , describes in impressive detail the Soviet military machine and its ever growing arsenal of new weapons systems , tanks , missiles , ships , artillery and aircraft . Put together by the Defense Intelligence Agency , the report is the largest and most comprehensive release of declassified intelligence data in the Pentagon 's history . Its purpose : to send a red alert to Americans and their allies that the U.S.S.R. is gaining a military edge over the West . Warned Weinberger : " We have to move very rapidly to correct the imbalances and regain our strength . " <P> The report was released just three days before President Reagan announced his decisions on the MX missile and the B-1 bomber . Naturally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon justify the vast sums needed for the new strategic systems . Weinberger flatly denied the charge . Plans for the booklet , he said , began last April after the U.S. presentation of a top-secret " threat assessment " of Soviet military strength to NATO defense ministers in Bonn . The ministers were sufficiently impressed to urge Weinberger to make the study public so they could use it to defuse opposition in their own countries to hikes in defense spending , as well as to the planned basing of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles on European soil . <P> Weinberger agreed , and over the next few months the Pentagon wrangled with the CIA over exactly what information could and could not be made public . For example , CIA officials vetoed satellite photos and insisted on fudging statistics , lest Moscow learn too much about how well the U.S. gathers its intelligence . The final document thus features full-color artists ' renderings of satellite pictures , rounded-off figures , and vague predictions about forthcoming Soviet weaponry . " Every product of the intelligence community is a compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors . " <P> Although the report contains no startling disclosures , in its breadth of detail it is convincing-and even frightening . There are illustrations-drawn in rather crude Flash Gordon style from satellite photos-of the new 25,000-ton Typhoon missile submarine , an SS-20 launch site , the experimental T-80 tank and surface-to-air laser weapons . Maps target where Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles and intermediate-range SS-20s have been placed , chart the location of Soviet divisions , and illustrate the sweep of Soviet adventurism around the globe , complete with lists of technicians and advisers stationed abroad . To bolster its point that Moscow is forever building new weapons systems , the study cites Soviet development of a new long-range bomber and a radar warning and control plan similar to AWACS . <P> Among the other notable points : <P> &gt; Moscow now fields some 50,000 tanks and 20,000 artillery pieces . The current Soviet edge in tanks ( more than 3 to 1 in Europe ) will grow even larger during the 1980s . <P> &gt; In each of the past eight years , the Soviets have built more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
