A memorial for Viet Nam vets <P> The ceremony in the sunny Rose Gar den was brief and subdued , but it was one of the most moving-and symbolic-that President Carter has conducted during his term in office . The event reflected the slowly evolving trend toward coming to terms with the Viet Nam War and recognizing the sacrifice of those who served in that corrosive conflict . Carter spoke before signing a bill providing land for a memorial to the Americans who had died in Southeast Asia . Said he : " A long and painful process has brought us to this moment . Our nation was divided by this war . For too long , we tried to put that di vision behind us by forgetting the Viet Nam War . In the process , we ignored those who bravely answered their nation 's call . We are ready at last to acknowledge more deeply the debt which we can never fully pay to those who served . " <P> Sitting in the audience of some 100 veterans was Jan Scruggs , 30 , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a Labor Department specialist in equal-opportunity programs , he saw The Deer Hunter in April 1979 and vividly relived the moment when a U.S. mortar shell accidentally exploded , killing several bud dies . Scruggs decided then and there to honor those who did not come back . He sold some land he owned for $2,500 and started banging on doors in what seemed like a hopeless crusade to raise $1 million . <P> Working indefatigably , Scruggs gained such allies as Rosalynn Carter and Gerald Ford , and he persuaded Bob Hope to sign a fund-raising letter that went out to a million potential donors . All 100 Senators are listed as sponsors of the bill , a rare unanimity achieved in part by the shrewd tactics of Scruggs ; when several Senators hesitated at the last moment , he called their aides to say that every other Senator had signed on . Fearful of being the only one left off the list , the remaining Senators quickly gave their approval . The bill donates two acres of land in Constitution Gardens , just northeast of the Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With $275,000 already in hand , Scruggs is determined to raise the rest of the needed funds , now upped to an estimated $2.5 million , and have the monument finished in two years . A design competition will be an nounced soon and a jury of architects and art experts will select the winning en try . Scruggs and his fellow vets insist on just one requirement : the completed memorial must contain 57,000 names-those of every American who died in the war . Jan Scruggs
