txt Companies that spend over $100 million a year each on television commercials and gripe about the cost of advertising are a little like tycoons moaning about grocery prices . It 's hard to believe they ca n't foot their bills . But listen to the ad buyer for one of the 10 largest TV users , a major consumerproducts maker . Television costs that have outpaced ad budgets , he says , have resulted in a 50% drop in five years in the number of consumers his company reaches through television . " We 're scratching our heads trying to figure out what to do , " he says . So are a lot of companies of all sizes . Rising television costs , they say , are diminishing advertisers ' power to reach TV audiences . As a result , companies that market their products on the tube are scrambling to stretch their ad dollars . Since 1975 , TV advertising costs have increased 75% for network time and 58% for spot time . Rates this year , says McCann-Erickson Inc. , an ad agency will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Mather Inc. , another agency , a 30-second spot on a show like " Mork &; Mindy " that reaches 17 million households will go for $342,000 ; today it sells for $116,000 . " Too Successful " ? - " The medium has proven too successful . " says Stephen Leff , executive vice president of Backer &; Spielvogel Inc. , the agency for Miller Brewing Co . " Something 's got to give , but I do n't know what , when or where . " Until that something materializes , advertisers must search for ways to deal with rising costs . The accompanying table , based on recently compiled data , suggests the most common tactic : adding to the ad budget . Few companies , however , can increase it enough . Advertisers that accounted for 80% of spending on network TV between 1975 and 1979 did n't increase their budgets enough to keep up with TV-rate changes , a study by Ted Bates &; Co. , an ad agency , concludes . " We 're unable to increase budgets to stay whole , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which spent $14L7 million on TV last year . " The biggest brands are getting hurt just as badly as the smaller ones . " One reason is that many companies make their various brands , in effect , earn extra ad dollars . " We never get bigger budgets because ad costs have gone up , " explains one marketer . " We get bigger budgets by selling more product . " Often , those least able to do that are packaged-goods manufacturers , which find many of their products growing only as fast as the population . Ironically , these are the companies whose ads supported TV in its first two decades  --  and that owe much of their own success to television advertising . Consequently , many of the leading packaged-goods concerns , and many other companies as well , are changing their uses of TV . They 've been forced , says Lawrence Cole , Ogilvy senior vice president , to " get more blood out of the stone . " To contend with rising costs , many advertisers are switching to daytime and latenight TV slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short blitzes rather than spreading their ads evenly through the year . Some are buying time only on select , expensive programs that can deliver a much higher proportion of prospective customers . Standard Brands Inc. , for example , recently made the switch from prime time for its Blue Bonnet margarine . To make sure it had n't erred , though , the company kept Blue Bonnet in prime time in four cities as a test . 's Corp. , which increased its TV spending 20% last year , uses the blitz technique and finds the added benefit of keeping competitors off guard . Dr Pepper 's $8.5 million TV budget for 1979 was dwarfed by Coca-Cola 's $38.3 million and PepsiCola 's $34.5 million ( PepsiCo Inc. ' s total of $1192 million includes other soft drinks and Frito-Lay snack foods ) . So Dr Pepper put most of its TV money into youth-oriented music specials featuring such singers as John Denver , Barry Manilow and Olivia Newton-John . But there are signs that some smallerbudget brands ca n't survive much longer . One major advertiser recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just waiting for it to die , " says a marketing executive there . Another of the company 's products , once a major name in its category , is faltering because its $3 million TV ad budget pales in the face of competitors that spend four to eight times as much . New-Product Problems Also hard hit are new products . Some marketing specialists calculate that $10 million or more is needed to successfully introduce a new package food or a household or personal-care product on television . And that sum alone , says Joseph Ostrow , executive vice president of Young &; Rubicam Inc. , an ad agency , has been enough to scuttle new products that otherwise would have made the grade . " The price of entry in certain areas is huge and is getting bigger , " says Mr. Leff of Backer &; Spielvogel , which was recently hired to develop new product advertising for Seven-Up Co . Higher TV costs have also prompted advertisers to use other media More often . But the costs of newspaper , magazine and radio ads are also rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit to dollar-stretching . Says Ogilvy 's Mr. Cole : " We 've started running out of mirrors . " Even so , some observers say , the pressure caused by TV inflation might be beneficial if it compels advertisers to increase productivity and cut wasteful spending . " If companies are forced out of something they ca n't handle , " says Arthur Pearson , Standard Brands ' marketing-services vice president , " that might make them become more efficient . " Few advertisers and agencies fear that the medium will lose all effectiveness . For one thing , ad professionals say , competitors face the same predicaments . For another , the spread of cable television and the development of other electronic media eventually could slow TV 's rate rise . Some advertisers are also advocating greater use of 15-second and 20 ? second spots ? instead of the current 30-second ads ? and an increase in the total amount of commercial time allowed . Such measures could help hold down rates , but they would require network and regulatory approval and would add to commercial " clutter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television is that they continue to see it as an effective , glamorous sales tool . " TV is n't a wonder drug anymore , " notes Fred Lemont , a New York marketing consultant , " but top management still remembers the 1950s and 1960s when it was . " Furthermore , he says , major food and drug chains are reluctant to buy items that are n't backed by big TV ad campaigns . " Advertisers and agencies will protect themselves in TV first , " says Young &; Rubicam 's Mr. Ostrow . " Then they 'll see what 's available for other things . "
