" Pm not sure . Saint Francis of Assisi ? " she said quietly , adjusting her halo . We rode home in silence . Later that afternoon , 1 saw the horse van leave but thought nothing of it till I found a battered mare bed  --  ded down on piles of straw in our car  --  port . " We have a new child , " my wife said , her face alight with a Iittle-girl grin . " That husky fellow and I had a talk , and he Finally agreed the mare was n't quite right for him . Since we do n't have any extra stalls , your car will have to sleep outside . " Beau and Nandor glanced at one another as if to say , " Lucky mare . She really fell into a bucket of butter .

She is not only an animal lover but a saber-rattling warrior on their be  --  half , imbued with the righteous moral fervor of a revolutionary . She firmly agrees with Mahatma Gandhi : " The way you can judge the moral progress of a civilization is by the way it treats its animals . " She is an attractive , bewitching fe male with depths that belie one 's first impression of vacuous-mind-with-pret  --  ty-face . She is an iconoclast who walks her own line and does n't go through life seeking reassurances from the herd . She has a weakness for chocolate , back rubs and Paul Newman . Not necessarily in that order . Her name is Elizabeth . Animalholism is a strange malady . Like love , it is incurable , and occa  --  sionally I must put on a show of best-face bonhomie to cope with Eliza  --  beth 's monomania . Sometimes it 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , her out  --  spokenness often flutters in the false eyelashes of the high-society birds . We were once a very popular cou  --  ple . There was a time when we re  --  volved , like the wheels of a slot ma  --  chine , through the black-tie dinner cir  --  cuit in company with the heavy-wallet set . Parties overflowed with women who wore their minds in braids and with men who babbled banalities about duck clubs and African safaris . If bored , at least we were n't bored for long ; my animalholic live-in inevitably pushed us onto the downwind side of the social gulch . It began at a soiree one evening when a prominent , retrousse-nosed Brahmin recounted his deer-hunting exploits with measured braggadocio . " Bang , bang , " he intoned in a sonorous Ivy League vibrato , " I hit that 16-pointer between the eyes and April ' 85 dropped hint cold . " " Oh , Chuncey , " the hostess twit  --  tered , " you 're such a magnificent sportsman ! " I sensed the rising of Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wearing her mink smile . Then , in a voice rich in jocular tones , she paraphrased Mark Twain : " If a man could be crossed with a deer , it would improve man but would deteriorate the deer . " Silence felt on the room . All pres  --  ent sat staring at their plates as if caught in flagrante delicto . We were never invited there again . When I first met this untapped charge of dynamite , she appeared to be the candlelight-and-cocktail type , always looking as if she had just stepped out of a fashion plate . I was the rider , continuously flexing my biceps like the all-American cowboy . At that time , Elizabeth did n't know a mare from a gelding . Soon after we were married , how  --  ever , my whirling dervish began her riding career . As a relentless believer in human perfectibility  --  improve , al  --  ways improve  --  in a few years she be  --  came a well-balanced rider . And after several of the leading riding masters sanded down the grainy edges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gether . Elizabeth became the chef de cuisine and I the short-order cook . This role reversal caused some troublesome strains in our marriage boat . It was with mixed emotions that I would watch her little figure guide her huge , spirited jumpers , with skill and dexterity , over the fences . It 's difficult to target the exact mo  --  ment when Elizabeth became a stri  --  dent animalholic ; the virus has prob  --  ably been incubating since her birth . But last year her quirky behavior be  --  came so pronounced that I realized I was married to a woman with more than her share of idiosyncracies . On cold nights , she left the front door open for the horses . For Christmas , she gave each dog a moped and a pair of Porsche aviator glasses . The cats received ballet shoes and a paperback on " how to behave at a Tupperware party . " The horses got an Atari space machine and red long johns with drop seats .

Shepherding 18 animals across country was a Sisyphean task . But La Contessa managed our seven reddish-brown Hungarian vizslas , five barn cats and six titanic jumpers and dressage horses in harmony and tran  --  quility . Three thousand miles in our crowded ark , and Elizabeth put Noah to shame . A few months after we dropped an  --  chor in Middleburg , Elizabeth de  --  cided it was time to expose Sandor and Sergei , the more intellectual dogs , to a bit of cultural high gloss . We took them on the 55-minute drive to the nation 's capital . The four of us ambled toward the Washington Monument , Elizabeth between the two dogs . She wore a periwinkle sweater and skirt which caught the incandescent blue of her eyes . It was good to see her out of riding pants for a change . Long of leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a well-turned ankle . It is a pleasurable combination . Sandor and Sergei , freshly scrubbed , shone like new copper in the early morning sun . Their posture was regal , and they swaggered along imperiously in the manner of those who expect the streets to be carpeted . Suddenly the dogs put their noses to the ground , nostrils dilating as they picked up a familiar scent . Horses . They veered off a grassy , shaded knoll and froze , muzzles pointing at a group of mounted policemen . My inamorata paused  --  then impet  --  uously and with a coltish exuberance , she started up the hill . Sandor and Sergei gave me a knowing look . D6ja vu . . . La Contessa was going to play U-boat commander again . Unwilling to be caught in the eye of the tornado , I tried to hide my beach ball of a belly behind a nearby tree . Tourists stared . I was sure they thought I was going to relieve myself .

He was tall and well built , a handsome brute in a sleazy , salacious way . " Watch out for your dogs , lady , " he chuckled . " Do n't worry , " Elizabeth said , her luminous eyes happy and flirtatious . " I have horses . We understand each other . " " You talk to animals ? " he joshed . " In a way . Animals are n't verbal  --  they communicate by reading one an-other 's minds . " Her voice took on a gently authoritative tone . " Right now , your horses are telling me that they are unhappy . " " These horses ? Unhappy ? Look how fat they are ! " " Your martingales are too tight .

The reason for the spectators ' mirth ? The star 's pen  --  chant for improvisation has turned the rest of the cast into cackling groupies . Finally Bill Cosby , greeted by applause and hoots , steps into the darkened portion of the set to ad  --  monish the onlookers . A spotlight il  --  luminates him . " Stop laughing , " he says . " I 'm doing it all wrong and you 're just encouraging me .

Even the most self-absorbed New Yorker stops to stare at Cosby 's face , a face that shelves an encyclopedia of comical expressions . A waiter carrying a tray above his head turns the corner and , noticing Cosby , does a double take that causes him to spill the dishes . " That 's not funny , " says Cosby , the master of the deadpan . " Now do it again and make it funny . " It 's the waiter 's turn to laugh now . Bill Cosby , at 47 years old , is not the avuncular , joke-a-minute sort you might expect him to be , based on his numerous comedy albums and those ingratiating commercials for Jell-0 pudding . He is , instead , a sagacious , serious fellow , a man of many inter  --  ests and strong opinions , who speaks slowly and chooses his words careful  --  ly . His observations come forth in a folksy manner , much like the stories of Mark Twain , full of truths of hu  --  man behavior that teach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosby 's patented mug . At the moment , Cosby is ensconced in the role of concerned parent as he discusses the domestic troubles that inspired his return to television , trou  --  bles that began several years ago when he and his wife , Camille , purchased a " dish " antenna that brought 25 dif  --  ferent TV channels into their Massa-chusetts home  --  much to the immedi  --  ate delight of their five children . " But we created a new problem , " Cosby explains . " It was no longer that they were watching too much television . Instead , we had to monitor the con  --  tent of the shows . " What passed for entertainment on the airwaves was of special interest to William Henry Cosby , Ed.D. , whose 242-page dissertation examined tele  --  vision as an aid to learning . He found little educational value in the gaggle of shows his new antenna plucked from orbiting satellites . " My kids , if unmonitored , could watch four dif  --  ferent movies showing cars smashing , people getting drunk and sex without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus prescribed no more television : " We told the chil  --  dren that later on in life , when we are very old and can not take care of ourselves , they could beat us up for not letting them watch . " Cosby did n't put himself in a posi  --  tion like the patriot Patrick Henry and holler at the network brass : " Give me better programming or give me death . " Cosby , instead , chose to lead by example and decided to return to television , after an eight-year absence , with a series of his own , much like a parent who joins the PTA and hopes he can make a difference . " It was cheaper to do a series than to throw out my family 's TV sets , " he says . But CBS and ABC turned him down . " 1 walked in at a bad time , " he says , " because everybody in the gray suits and paisley ties said that , according to marketing reports , sit  --  coms were over . " So here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black family that is not going to be of the street-level humor ; a wife who 's a profes  --  sional person ; five children ; and a show that deals with the human be-havior of the people in the series more than making up situations so the breasts can come out and the pants can come down . " The third time was the charm . NBC finally gave Cosby the go-ahead , and what he developed is an absolutely fetching sitcom . " The Cosby Show , " ranked consistently among the ten most popular programs and watched each week by an estimated 38.3 mil  --  lion people , is this season 's prime-time sensation , a dignified jewel among half-hour duds . No one is more pleased than the man listed on the show 's credits as creator , produc  --  er , writer and star . " I 'm pleasantly surprised at the show 's success , " Cosby says with a grin . " I was just hoping it could stay on , because I have so much to give . " An insightfully funny portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cosby Show " is crammed with the sort of amusing fancies and foibles of con  --  temporary family life that spark a smile of instant recognition among viewers . " The show is really a love story to people , " Cosby says . " It 's about what I studied for at the uni  --  versity ; it 's about my gratitude that I finally woke up as a youngster and went to college ; and it 's about my love for telling and writing stories . Most of all , though , it 's entertain  --  ment for the entire family .
