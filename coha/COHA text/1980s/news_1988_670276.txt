NEW YORK  --  Activity in the U.S. bond markets was exceptionally light yesterday because of the Columbus Day holiday . The Treasury bond market here was closed for the holiday . In the debt-futures markets , Treasury bond futures prices fell slightly , hurt by higher oil prices and a weaker dollar . Nevertheless , many analysts and investment managers remain bullish on bonds for at least the next few weeks . They say recent government statistics indicate slower economic growth that will help keep inflation under control , removing any pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise rates any further . " There ' s further room on the upside in bond prices as we get more evidence that the pace of economic activity remains upward , but not as sharply as people thought three or four weeks ago , " said Norman Mains of Bateman Eichler Hill Richards Inc. of Beverly Hills , Calif . Bond prices soared Friday , posting their biggest gains in over a month , after the Labor Department reported unexpectedly small increases in business hiring last month . Prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or $16. 25 for each $1 , 000 face amount . The yield on the benchmark 30-year government bonds fell to 8. 80% , the lowest level since mid-April . In London yesterday , the Treasury ' s benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted late in the afternoon at a price of 103 3/32 , down 3/8 of a point from the New York close Friday . The yield rose slightly to 8. 82% . In the U.S. debt futures market yesterday , December U.S. Treasury bond futures declined to 90 1/32 , down 11/32 of a point . Mr. Mains of Bateman Eichler said that " to have bonds only down about 3/8 of a point is a relatively positive development " in view of how sharply oil prices rose on the day . Traders attributed part of yesterday ' s mild bond market slump to renewed speculation that Congress will approve legislation soon to increase the government ' s authority to issue new long-term bonds . That would enable the Treasury to sell a large volume of new 30-year bonds next month , a development that several traders say would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislative battle intently . Senate staff members said they have been bombarded over the past few weeks by repeated requests from bond traders for the latest assessments on how quickly the measure will be enacted . The Treasury request has widespread support in Congress , but the provision ' s fate remains in doubt anyway because it is part of a complex tax bill being debated in the Senate . The Senate is scheduled to vote on the issue today . The Treasury didn ' t sell any new long-term bonds in its August financing because its authority to sell new long-term issues was nearly all used up . The government ' s regular weekly sale of $14 billion of new short-term Treasury bills , usually held each Monday , will be held today instead . Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell about $6. 75 billion of new seven-year notes . In when-issued trading late Friday , those notes were quoted at 8. 58% . Corporate Issues Corporate bond prices were little changed in light holiday trading . Dealers said there was virtually no secondary trading , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was news yesterday , though , that could have an impact on the debt of a few corporations today . Best Products Co. agreed to be purchased for $684. 8 million by Adler &; Shaykin . Dealers said it is uncertain how much debt will be used to finance the leveraged buy-out . Also , Tenneco Inc. announced that it has entered into contracts to sell nearly all of its oil and gas businesses for about $7. 3 billion , an amount that is on the upper end of what many analysts thought the company would fetch . Chevron Corp. ' s purchase is the largest . It said it will buy Tenneco ' s Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas reserves for about $2. 6 billion . Another buyer is Mesa L.P. , which said it will buy Tenneco ' s Mid-Continent Division oil and gas unit for $715 million . Analysts and traders say larger oil companies like Chevron have a lot of cash on hand , and such an acquisition shouldn ' t have too much impact on the company . They said it is uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fixed-income analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said the key for Tenneco debt holders will be how much of the proceeds will be used to retire debt . Mr. Roach said there has been some speculation that if Tenneco was to raise an amount close to $7 billion , it would consider doing a stock repurchase program . He added that this would not be as positive for bondholders because the company would be more leveraged . In the preferred market , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. confirmed yesterday what market participants have suspected for sometime : Shearson owns the lion ' s share of MCorp ' s auction-rate preferred stock . Shearson , a unit of American Express Co. made that disclosure in a statement in which the firm said it was supportive of MCorp ' s request to seek assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . In the statement , Shearson said it is a holder of $117. 5 million of MCorp ' s money-market preferred stock , an issue that totals $125 million and was underwritten by Shearson in May 1985 . The MCorp auction-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a so-called failed auction . That occurred in August 1987 when not enough investors showed up to bid for the preferred . With an auction-style preferred , a new dividend is set every 49 days through a dutch auction process in which investors bid on dividend rates they wish to receive for shares they either own or wish to purchase . An auction fails when not enough bids are received . After the issue ' s first failed auction last year , Shearson told investors who wanted to get out of the issue that it was willing to buy the paper from them , an offer that was apparently accepted by many . Municipals Municipal bond prices declined very slightly in listless trading , largely because of a sharp advance in oil prices . With many dealer desks half-staffed and few institutional investors participating , activity was minimal . The New Jersey Turnpike Authority ' s 7. 20% bonds due 2018 were quoted late yesterday at 94 7/8 bid , to yield about 7. 63% . At Friday ' s close , traders said the bonds were quoted at 95 1/8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perk up substantially today when a number of sizable new tax-exempt issues are tentatively scheduled for pricing . Foreign Bonds British government bonds rallied , bolstered by the pound ' s strength in the foreign-exchange markets . West German government bond prices also advanced . In London , prices of British government issues , known as gilts , ended as much as 1/2 point higher as the pound surged against the dollar . Nigel Lawson , Chancellor of the Exchequer , indicated that he is prepared to defend the pound with higher rates , if needed . These comments initially were taken as bearish for gilts . But prices were soon pushed higher as sterling started rising steadily , fueled by the outlook for high rates and by an overall weaker trend in the dollar . At midday , the British market got an extra boost from the release of the latest producer price data , which proved more reassuring about inflation than economists had forecast . The data showed that while manufacturing output prices rose 0. 4% in September , input prices fell 0. 5% . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a director of Kleinwort Grieveson Securities . He said it will help to reduce fears of strong underlying inflationary pressures in the economy . He said this and sterling ' s rally helped to bring " a little retail support , " but that turnover in the market still remained relatively low . Meanwhile , overall sentiment continued to be underpinned by the Bank of England ' s recent bond purchases . Dealers said there weren ' t any signs of activity during the day , but most investors remain wary of being caught with short positions . At the end of the day , the British government ' s 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 was up 1/2 point to 117 21/32 to yield 9. 46% . In West Germany , the yield on benchmark 10-year government issues remained under the psychologically important 6. 50% level throughout the day . As of late in the afternoon , the government ' s benchmark 6 3/4% issue of 1998 was up 0. 40 point to 102 to yield 6. 465% . The Tokyo market was closed for a national holiday .
