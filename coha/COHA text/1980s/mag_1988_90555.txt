One of the saddest of questions in sports is " Whatever happened to ... ? " We ask it all the time , because , while we eagerly create heroes every season , we discard just as many when their legs go or their eyes go or their arms go . It 's such an unfair question , too . We ca n't expect these heroes to hit pay dirt , hurl goose eggs or tickle the twine forever . When they do stop , we retire their numbers and forget them . Love ' em and leave ' em . // Everybody 's All-American , a movie starring Dennis Quaid , Jessica Lange and Timothy Hutton , and directed by Taylor Hackford , answers the question , " Whatever happened to Gavin Grey , the Grey Ghost ? " Based on the novel by SI senior writer Frank Deford , Everybody 's All-American follows Gavin ( Quaid ) , his wife , Babs ( Lange ) , and his nephew . Cake ( Hutton ) , over a span of 25 years , as Gavin  --  whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has-been . Meanwhile , Babs , the ornamental Magnolia Queen , becomes a woman of independence and substance . And Cake , as the constant observer , goes from a saucer-eyed student to a professor cringing with embarrassment over his uncle 's decline . // The sweeping chronological story gives the movie an old-time structure : they do n't make ' em like that anymore . Yet it also has an almost ' 60s sensibility and a modern artfulness . The screenplay is fairly faithful to the novel , although there are alterations . The college is now LSU , not North Carolina . A few characters have been dropped . And the moviemakers have opted for a more upbeat ending . It does n't seem like a cheat , however . // Hackford scores in the opening sequence , an evocative depiction of a 1956 pep rally . In fact , the pep rally is so good that the movie has to play catch-up . And eventually it does catch up , thanks to some other memorable scenes : an impromptu race between the Ghost and his black counterpart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 56 Sugar Bowl ; Gavin working his way through the Magnolia Queen 's many crinolines. // The football scenes are excellent . Quaid actually broke his collarbone during the filming ; Tim Fox , once a safety for the Patriots , Chargers and Rams , hit him a little too hard in one scene . // Beyond the gridiron , the movie still has the ring of truth , but it also has flaws . It 's too long , for one thing , and there are a number of clich ? s around . But the moments of verisimilitude far outnumber the clunkers. // Quaid gives a breakthrough performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination , not to mention the Heisman . He 's quite believable both as the happy-go-lucky BMOC and later as the slightly pathetic golf pro . Along the way he lets us see that Gavin knows exactly where the pitfalls of fame lie . That does n't mean he can avoid them . And Quaid lets us feel Gavin 's paralysis . // Lange is also quite good , although  --  dare we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingenue . She 's a good match for Babs in one way , though . Lange 's own growth as an actress is mirrored in Babs 's development , for Lange too went from window dressing ( King Kong ) to an Oscar ( Tootsie ) . // As Cake , Hutton is more of a humorless drip than his character in the book . At least Hutton helps the story along by changing hairstyles every so often . Carl Lumbly is quietly effective as Narvel , the talented though undiscovered player who turns his energies toward civil rights . One of Hackford 's best tricks is telling such a large story with such a small cast . Oh yes , Deford appears in a cameo as the bigoted proprietor of a diner . He 's remarkably , umm , tall . // There are all sorts of reasons for seeing Everybody 's All-American : the acting , the football , the romance . But the best reason might be just to find out whatever happened to your old heroes .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
