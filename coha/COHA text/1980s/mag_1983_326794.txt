A baby sparks a race debate <P> The case was a textbook illustration of the absurdity of South Africa 's rigid apartheid policy . In a field on the outskirts of Pretoria , a black worker came upon a two-week-old infant wrapped in a blanket , her head covered with a paper bag . The abandoned baby was taken to a nearby hospital , where nurses named her Lize . <P> What should have been a happy ending was only the beginning of a national controversy . By law , every South African citizen must be assigned to one of four racial categories : white , black , " colored " ( mixed race ) , or Asian . According to the country 's elaborate apartheid code , Lize should have been classified on the basis of her " appearance , " along with " habits , education and speech in general . " But while Lize 's complexion was darkish , because she was an infant it was impossible to apply the standard criteria . <P> In a hasty attempt to resolve the issue , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strand of Lize 's hair proved that she was of mixed race . But South Africa 's leading expert on hair immediately denounced the tentative finding as " meaningless , " arguing that hair samples of infants do not reveal racial characteristics . The government then repudiated the police , calling the test " inconclusive . " <P> As police searched for the child 's parents , outrage mounted over the classification policy . Racial typing , declared the Rand Daily Mail , was " the cause of more human agony than any other of the South African statutes . " Dr. Marius Barnard , a member of the opposition Progressive Federal Party and brother of Heart Surgeon Dr. Christiaan Barnard , urged the government to classify Lize as white . Said he : " It is the innocent who suffer in these matters . " At week 's end no one had yet decided whether Lize would go through life enjoying the privileges of white society or be a second-class citizen .                   @ @
