The breakup of the phone system has so far produced mainly problems <P> When the Bell System was broken up on New Year 's Day , no one expected immediate technological or managerial miracles . In that sense , no one has been disappointed . Nearly four months after Bell was turned into a new American Telephone &; Telegraph and seven regional holding companies responsible for local phone service , the rewards of divestiture remain chiefly a promise , while the problems are as complex and acute as ever . <P> Many Americans seem to feel dismay over the whole breakup and are irritated by changes that are mainly small but still inconvenient . Says retired Salesman Jack Reiss , 83 , of Harrisburg , Pa. : " I do n't know why they broke up Ma Bell , but I wish they would put it back together . " Concurs Larry Mixon , district manager for Southern Bell in Florida : " Human beings do n't like change . They have a problem adjusting .

Stockholders are expected to confront Chairman Charles Brown with a sorry list of woes . Those will include declining service , the company 's rapidly shrinking share of the $44 billion longdistance market ( in the face of gains by competitors such as MCI Communications and GTE Sprint ) , weakened revenue and earnings projections for 1984 , and the performance of the new company 's stock since November , down 20% to a near low of 15 ? last week . <P> The most immediate effect consumers are seeing after divestiture is new phone bills .

If anything goes wrong now , they blame it on divestiture . Says Illinois Bell 's Patricia Montgomery : " A woman called to complain about some problems , which were caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could convince her that it was because of a wet cable , not divestiture . " Another Illinois customer groused that the phone company was " driving up the cost of service , " when in fact his most recent local-service bill was $21.93 , only 58 more than last September 's . <P> The complaining seems to have crested in some areas . Calls have fallen off sharply to many of the local operating companies ' " let 's talk " lines , which were begun last year to explain the twists and turns of the breakup . Nonetheless , since the first of the year the Federal Communications Commission has received 14,000 letters of complaint about phone service , 400% more than usual . Biggest gripe : slowness in installing new lines . The central message in most of the mail has less to do with actual shortcomings than with a changing attitude toward the phone company . Says an FCC staffer : " People feel the phone company is less friendly . If the new companies squander the service image that AT &T; gave them , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
