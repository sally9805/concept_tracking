Day after day , network crews restlessly peer down from their perch in the Santa Ynez Mountains , looking for photo opportunities at the adobe ranch buildings three miles distant that serve as Ronald Reagan 's Western White House . But thick swirls of morning fog and shimmering waves of afternoon heat obscure their camera view , and the subject stays half hidden in the shade . <P> On doctors ' orders , Reagan restricted his exercise to leisurely strolls with Wife Nancy . Then last Saturday the President obliged the network crews by appearing on horseback with Nancy and five others . Wearing jodhpurs , plaid shirt and a baseball-style hat , Reagan rode for 30 minutes . His mount was perfectly named for the occasion : Elusive Hobby . <P> Reagan has been following a go-slow regimen so that his body 's " cement " can harden properly after major surgery last July for a cancerous polyp in his bowel . The former lifeguard , once cheerily vain about his lifelong " coat of tan , " has given up his morning sunbaths and wears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also doctors ' orders , aimed at preventing a recurrence of the skin cancer that was scraped from his nose last month . <P> Reagan , who on earlier summer retreats to his beloved Rancho del Cielo chopped wood and bagged rattlesnakes with photogenic robustness , clearly had been itching to get back in the saddle again . Says one aide : " If the President had his way , he would have ridden a horse from Point Mugu ( the Naval air station some 60 miles away , where Air Force One lands ) to the ranch . " Reagan at least had plenty of time to read the stacks of briefing papers National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane keeps feeding him in preparation for the November summit in Geneva . The papers range from an analysis of the Russian psyche to a synopsis of superpower relations over the past 15 years . Reagan also found time to indulge his taste for Louis L'Amour westerns . <P> The First Lady has always been a good sport about the rustic pleasures of Rancho del Cielo , but she has been unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialite Betsy Bloomingdale in more citified surroundings . Last week Nancy got a chance to sample the glitzy social whirl of Beverly Hills when the Reagans came down off the mountain for a three-day sojourn in lotus land . They hobnobbed at dinner parties with old Hollywood cronies like Jimmy Stewart , and ate chicken with three of their children ( Maureen was in Sacramento ) in a $3,000a-night presidential suite at the Century Plaza Hotel . The First Couple then returned to the 688-acre ranch for another lazy week . By the time the Reagans climb aboard Air Force One for the flight back to Washington this weekend , they will have spent 200 days  --  more than half a year  --  at the ranch since Reagan took office in 1981 . <P> For Reagan 's aides , camped out in Santa Barbara , some 30 miles down the mountain from the ranch , it was time to take marching orders from Chief of Staff Donald Regan , who has emerged as the undisputed boss in a once loose hierarchy of advisers . White House staffers have been noticeably less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the news-hungry White House press corps . Only McFarlane has managed to retain some autonomy , by virtue of his foreign policy expertise and willingness to speak out .
