But as the university and community have grown , emphasis on the school ' s football program has declined. // It was not so long ago when Howdy Myers was the coach and the Flying Dutchmen were a college division power , just one level below the major universities . The comedian Bill Cosby even helped give the school a cult following during the 1960 ' s when he described his experiences playing for Temple University and preparing for a game against vaunted Hofstra. // // Days Gone By // But to many of the students now attending Hofstra , Cosby is a middle- age pitchman for pudding , and Myers sounds like the name of a popular children ' s program their older brothers and sisters watched . It becomes more difficult to extol tradition when most of the football library was inexplicably discarded . This occurred during the 1970 ' s , when the National Collegiate Athletic Association was restructured and Hofstra de-emphasized its football program and moved down to Division III. // Despite this , there has been a reawakening on campus as Hofstra prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most important game since 1965 . Both teams are 7-0 and the winner probably will be assured one of the two playoff berths in the Eastern Regional of the Division III playoff . Hofstra is ranked third in the country in the N.C.A.A. poll and St. John ' s is tied for fourth . The game will match Hofstra ' s defense , which has allowed 3. 5 points , against St. John ' s offense , which is averaging 35 points . <> <> Interest Is Growing // And although the atmosphere on campus this week can not be compared with the fervor that grips South Bend and Ann Arbor and Lincoln during the week of an important game , interest at Hofstra is considerable. // Christopher Humm , the sports information director , said that he has sold the school ' s allotment of visitors ' tickets and that two buses have been chartered to take students to the game in Jamaica , Queens. // " Some guys who played here have come back to see what ' s going on , " said Bob McKenna , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a game that rivals any of the previous big games in Hofstra ' s history . The Dutchmen had their only unbeaten season in 1959 , when they were 9-0 . They were ranked third among college division teams and played in the Cement Bowl in 1962 . They were 5-0 and ranked seventh before losing in midseason to Southern Connecticut in 1965 . But when Myers retired as coach after the 1973 season and Hofstra stepped down to Division III , the memorable games ended. // The next season , under Bill Leete , Hofstra was 1-9-1 . Interest in the program began to decline , compounded by the fact that at a commuter school , students generally are not as involved in campus activities . <> <> Out of the Dormant State // But Mickey Kwiatkowski , an energetic man who paces nervously and speaks at the pace of a two-minute drill , brought Hofstra football out of its dormant state when he arrived in 1981 . He had a 4-6 record that season and was 6-4 last year , but more importantly , his enthusiasm helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished this while exposing a philosophy that football in Division III is football in its rightful place . There are no scholarships permitted at this level ; thus , in theory , the student-athlete should not be under pressure to concentrate on football at the expense of his studies. // To reiterate this point , Kwiatkowski posted an article on the lockerroom bulletin board about Marcus Dupree , the disenchanted Oklahoma running back who left school and now has enrolled at Southern Mississippi . Kwiatkowski said that he thought Dupree was a professional athlete who was interested only in enhancing his career and was being exploited. // He also has asked the players about how the pressure of the St. John ' s game has affected their school work and social lives. // " I know their minds are on the game but I want to make sure their minds are on other vital things in their lives too , " Kwiatkowski said. // " What attracted me to Hofstra is that its philosophy and framework for football fit mine . Being a student here is first and we want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of program that exploits a kid . Winning and losing is not an issue here ; integrity and morality are . " <> <> Idealistic Approach // It is an idealistic approach , he said , but it is working . Some of the players missed a day of practice this week or arrived late because of laboratory classes and tests . Mike Borges , a defensive lineman , took two midterm examinations as scheduled. // " Between school and football , we have an awful lot to do , " McKenna said . " At first , I thought Mickey was demanding too much of our time , but I don ' t think that way now . That ' s why I get angry when I hear about those big-time college players who don ' t go to class . We ' re doing the same as they could be doing. " // Kwiatkowski , who is 36 years old , attended the University of Delaware where he was an offensive lineman . He even played against one of Howdy Myers ' s teams . Hofstra , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the school produced several professional players such as John Schmitt , Don Gault , Fran Lynch and Wandy Williams . From 1950 through 1968 , Myers had 14 winning seasons . <> <> A Victim of Finances // But when financial troubles threatened to shut down the university in the early 1970 ' s , one of the actions taken by the administration to lessen the economic burden was to de-emphasize football . Hofstra still has a Division I basketball program , so Kwiatkowski is aware that an unbeaten season might rekindle talk about moving up again in football . A successful athletic program can give a university a high profile which some educators and boosters believe helps enrollment. // " There are a lot of neat things about success , " Kwiatkowski said , " but there are a lot of people coming out of the woodwork . They say , ' If you can take two aspirin to get rid of a headache , imagine how fast it would go away with five apsirin . ' Maybe , someday , we would make the move to Division I-AA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think there still is a realization that we belong at Division III . I would bet on us staying here.
