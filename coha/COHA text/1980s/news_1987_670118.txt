Before he took early retirement seven years ago , Howard Shank made a list of the things he wanted to do when he was no longer the president and chief creative officer at Leo Burnett Co. , a Chicago advertising agency . High on his agenda were painting , writing , golf and traveling . But Mr. Shank , who was then 57 years old , wasn ' t ready for his own advice . Instead , he let others tell him how a man of his talent , experience and vigor should spend his retirement years . So he taught , consulted and was miserable for 18 months . He didn ' t snap out of his melancholy until he realized that his professional achievements no longer mattered . " Retirement forced me to reinvent myself , " he says . And what the new Howard Shank really wanted to do was write , which had been on his list from the start . " I ' ve written one book ( about retirement ) and I ' m struggling cheerfully to write another , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retirement , the experts counsel , forces people to come to grips with what is important in their lives . Early retirement , whether by choice or not , is forcing thousands of managers in their mid-50s to early 60s to face the issue more abruptly , while they are still young and healthy enough to resent a career interruption  --  or to realize a dream . For some people , leaving a company after 20 or 30 years is as jolting as a forced separation from their family would be . Others welcome the chance to shuck the pressures of a job and commuting . Some retirees subsequently seek new careers because they need the challenge or the cash ; others shun anything commercial , preferring volunteer work or fishing and golf . Often , retirement means a new relationship with a spouse . The number of retirees has been growing . According to the General Accounting Office , an agency of Congress , 17% of men and 7% of women between the ages of 55 and 61  --  some 1. 9 million people in all  --  received pension benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available . The count doubled over 10 years . Most cited voluntary retirement , rather than health or disability , as their reason for not working . Sluggish economic conditions accelerated the rush to retire before the customary age of 65 . Hewitt Associates , an employee-benefits consultant , says that 32% of the companies it surveyed offered " some type of voluntary separation plan " in recent years , usually cash or richer pension benefits , to entice unneeded workers to leave . Most often , such plans took the form of " early retirement windows , " incentives for senior staffers who retired within , say , three months . Most of the companies found such an approach preferable to mandatory layoffs , which would have hit pensionless younger workers the hardest . Ground rules , though , are changing . To keep Baby Boomers in the work force longer , thus easing their future drain on the Social Security system , the federal government has been whittling away at the economic incentives for early retirement . Under 1983 legislation , the normal age for Social Security benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 1960 . This means that workers who want to start collecting benefits at the minimum age of 62 will ultimately get far less from Social Security . The new tax law , moreover , curtails early-retirement benefits in private pension plans . Under the old tax code , according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute , a worker retiring at age 55 could have received a maximum annual pension of $75 , 000 from a corporate defined-benefit pension plan . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 slashes that maximum for 55-year-old retirees to $40 , 600 , and , when the Social Security retirement age climbs to 67 , will cut it further , to $35 , 500 . Because existing pension rights are protected , though , early retirees may not feel the full sting of the revision for several years . When he faced the prospect of early retirement six years ago , Charles Gedge had plenty of misgivings . He was 59 when Sears , Roebuck &; Co. offered retirement incentives to 2 , 500 managers , aiming to reduce employment and make room for younger workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half pay for three years plus all his accrued pension benefits in a lump sum . Still , after 30 years with Sears , the last eight as director of purchasing in Chicago , Mr. Gedge wasn ' t ready to end his career . " I had seen so many people who retired at Sears who were dead in a couple of years , " he says . " The longevity wasn ' t very good . " But when a friend offered him a senior vice presidency at a laboratory-equipment concern , he accepted Sears ' s offer . While his new salary was only 60% of his Sears pay , with the income from his Sears pension and his severance pay he figured he was well ahead . His new job lasted only three years before the company was bought out and he was offered six months ' severance pay to again part ways . Now he is selling real estate , " doing just moderately " but enjoying it , he says . His initial qualms about retiring early have eased ; his health is fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . Robert Cullen had little choice about retiring when he returned to the U.S. last spring after serving in South Korea for two years as a vice president of a General Foods Corp. affiliate . He had spent 28 years with General Foods , much of it overseas . But the company , acquired in 1985 by Philip Morris Inc. , told him it didn ' t think it could reassign him . Instead , it offered him retirement with two years ' pay over seven years , plus accrued benefits , that worked out to about 45% of his pay . He retired last July at 58 , " disappointed " that General Foods no longer needed him and " psychologically unprepared " for a life of ease . " There was never any question I would stay home , " he says . " I need to be in the business world . " And he has quickly jumped back in , consulting for a company near his Valhalla , N.Y. , home and serving as U.S. representative for a Korean manufacturer . Though his wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a little more pragmatic view . I ' m taking home as much or more than when I was working . I am very sound and very content . " There was nothing sudden about Frederic Libby ' s retirement ; he plotted it for more than a decade and hasn ' t had any second thoughts . Five years ago , at age 60 , he left his job as supervisor of vocational training at Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester , N.Y. , after 32 years with the company . Eight years before , he had bought a lot on North Carolina ' s Outer Banks . And six years before , he had bought a boat suited to the Carolina waters . With a 50% Kodak pension and Navy benefits , he figures he can afford to live out his days happily on the beach . Roger Birk also laid out a retirement schedule when , in 1980 , he was asked to become the chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch &; Co . : He said he would probably retire in five years , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now the White House chief of staff , " offered to bet I would change my mind , " Mr. Birk says . But he was true to his word , ending 30 years with the brokerage house in July 1985 . " I don ' t think we ' re put on this earth to make all the money we can , " he says . " There are other ways you can live happily . " He didn ' t have any specific plans ; with the self-assurance of an executive who had earned as much as $1. 5 million a year , " I had confidence I could make happen what I wanted to happen , " he says . Now  --  besides being a low-handicap golfer  --  he is a director of four companies , a trustee of Notre Dame and a consultant at Merrill Lynch . " I ' m booked , " he says of his retirement schedule . " I feel good . I am happy . " Robert Swinarton , who retired six years ago at 54 as vice chairman of Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire early . But serving as a director or trustee wasn ' t part of his plan . " I cold-turkeyed , " he says from his mountain home in Dorset , Vt . " I made my deal on Thursday , packed my office and left on Friday , and I ' ve been back only once , a year ago . " In the past six years , he adds , " I haven ' t done a lick of work for pay . " His wife , Roddy , was apprehensive at first , fearful that a husband at home full time might impinge on her daily routine . " But we go our own ways during the day , " she says . And she soon discovered a plus . " When he was working , he was never at home . All the responsibilities were on my shoulders . Now he shares some of this . He frees me for other things . " Many executives , with savings from years of high earnings , houses already paid for , and pensions and Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Retirement living , moreover , is often cheaper than anticipated , with savings on commuting , lunch and clothing bills . But Arthur Freitas in Danbury , Conn. , knew he needed supplemental income when he accepted early retirement almost three years ago , at age 57 , from Union Carbide Corp . His 33 years with Carbide , most recently as an assistant controller , entitled him to one year ' s pay and a 60% pension . But two of his four children were still at home . So he worked first with a nonprofit agency and now is a business broker . Conrad Pologe was lucky in his financial planning . Three years ago , after 28 years with American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , the last as division manager for media relations in New York , he decided to retire at age 61 . He told the company he would staff a month-long conference in Geneva , Switzerland , as planned . But he said he wasn ' t coming back . He would stay on and live in Europe . Only while he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash incentives to persuade older managers to retire . " I got one year ' s pay out of the blue , " he says . This cushion has made retired life all the easier for him and his wife , first in Italy and now outside London . Betty Frederick probably didn ' t have to work after her husband , Raymond , retired as manager of training and development three years ago , at age 59 , from what was then Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Co . His early-retirement benefits , plus other income , brought him about 65% of his regular pay . But his wife of 42 years isn ' t about to give up her job as a claims examiner for a Ford Motor Co. insurance subsidiary . She didn ' t start working until 20 years into their marriage and , at 60 , says , " I get fulfillment out of my work . It keeps me thinking young . " Her paycheck , Mrs. Frederick adds , is " the difference between being frugal and being at ease . " Credit : Staff Reporter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
