Democrats in Congress moved to the right this week , but when all the speeches and press conferences were done , the party of Lyndon B. Johnson , John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt could breathe a sigh of relief that it was still to the left of the Republicans . In a crowded Senate hearing room , GOP conservatives from Idaho , Iowa and Colorado did more than any Democrat to block President Ronald Reagan ' s budget , not by demanding fewer cuts , but by demanding more . The White House yesterday described its defeat as " a bump on the wide road to passage of the President ' s economic package , " but the view from Capitol Hill was more of a world turned upside down . " There ' s no question that this is a problem , " Senate Republican whip Ted Stevens said of Thursday night ' s defeat of the budget in the Senate Budget Committee . Budget chairman Pete Domenici said the conservative demands for more cuts that derailed it amounted to " baloney . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do not have confidence in this President , " said the New Mexico Republican . " It certainly does not help the prospects of the President ' s tax-cut package . It doesn ' t make it easier . It makes it harder . " For House Democrats , the Senate vote against the budget was the one surprise in a week of orchestrated events designed to rally the party and redefine its national image . " Liberalism made the middle class of America , " Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr . has said , but in pursuit of that middle-class vote , the Massachusetts Democrat is prepared to move his party to the right . The Democratic " alternative budget " passed by the House Budget Committee this week embraces close to three-quarters of the spending cuts requested by Reagan , and an amendment on the floor is likely to add more budget authority for defense . The alternative to Reagan ' s three-year tax cut , outlined by Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) , is aimed toward a middle-class earning level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement of principles at midweek , the Democrats aligned themselves with many of the themes Republicans have run on in the past . " We ' re in a different world than five or 10 years ago , " said Rep. Richard Gephardt ( D-Miss. ) , who helped to draft the statement , during a press conference announcing the principles . " And the Democratic Party is now trying to address itself to that new world . " Gephardt is one of a young generation of leaders in his party . With O ' Neill taking more of a back seat at the press conference , the scene in the Rayburn room seemed a tableau of the party old and new . Rostenkowski , a gruff Chicago Democrat and the Speaker ' s favorite traveling companion , sat next to the younger and smoother Budget chairman James Jones ( D-Okla. ) , a man who worked once as Lyndon Johnson ' s aide and is redefining the Great Society nearly two decades later . " It is a shift to the right , " said one Democratic aide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps us to the left . " As if to underscore this point , the National Conservative Political Action Committee ( NCPAC ) is scheduled to announce its campaign Monday to help boost the President ' s economic program . An official at the New Right organization conceded late yesterday that Rostenkowski and Jones were both being considered as potential targets . There are rumblings that the Congressional Club , which helped to finance Jesse Helms ' Senate career in North Carolina , is beginning its own campaign , and O ' Neill woke up yesterday to see himself in the background of a Republican television ad promoting passage of the President ' s program . Among many Democrats , there is a sense that their survival as being the majority party in the House is at stake , and while the leadership struggles to hold onto its Southern conservative bloc , members from Northern , urban districts grow impatient . " Tell them they ' re damn Democrats , " Rep. Brian Donnelly , a Dorchester Democrat , said of the Southern conservatives . " Tell them they ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of the party . " For two weeks , all sides will be back in their districts for spring recess . When they return , the House will have the momentum again , with a budget ready to go to the Rules Committee late this month and then to the floor . The White House late Thursday negotiated a last-minute substitute to win votes from the Conservative Democratic Forum , and the first challenge for the House leadership will be to defeat this proposal . Rep. Charles Stenholm ( D-Texas ) , a member of the forum , announced yesterday that he will vote for the GOP " bipartisan " package , but if this fails , there is no certainty the Democratic alternative will fare much better . The budget rollcall is always one where it is easier to get members to say " no " than " yes , " and the Speaker will have to work to bring his liberal base along . " Tip O ' Neill is a practical liberal , " said one aide , However , in the hallway outside the House Budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have difficulty supporting the Democratic proposal . " Clearly these are the highest numbers we ' ll get out of Congress , but it ' s the difference between cutting off a finger and cutting off a hand , " she said . " I ' m not sure we ' ll actively oppose it , but we can ' t support it . " In the Republican Senate , the momentum is gone for the moment , and either Reagan must turn the conservatives around or Domenici must deal with the Democrats for what is likely to be a reduced tax cut . " I ' m going to get a resolution , " said the budget chairman . " I ' m not going to let this particular situation deny all the good work we ' ve done . " Across the Capitol , O ' Neill was careful to say nothing to drive his Republican opponents together . " It ' s a long road , " the Speaker said , " between now and final passage .
