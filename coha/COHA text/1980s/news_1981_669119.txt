In some cases , the changes were two-edged . While mechanization of agriculture fed the nation ' s people and industry more efficiently and inexpensively , it threw many farm laborers out of work . And the changes in America had yet to erase the images of poverty and dispare etched into the faces of many Americans by the depression and the dust bowl . Some of these economic refugees found their way to the new jobs opening around the country . Others were forced to wring out a living any way they could - wherever their job-bound autos ran out of gas . Last of three articles // You are standing beside the brick administration building at a Southern primary aviation school , and a line of men is drawn up smartly before you and the sun is sinking . Standing with you is the administrative officer , a reserve lieutenant who has been snatched from his law practice to give some idea of military discipline to potential American flyers . But these youngsters aren ' t Americans , they are Britishers , Englishmen , dropped suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this town and who has never been out of the South , and whose passionate loyalty to the region surpasses that of clansmen to their clans. // This commandant is already a bit put out by the young men under him , there is hardly a Southerner in the batch . ' ' Foreigners ' ' they are to him , from outside the South . He lets slip a comment on ' ' Yankees ' ' and apologetically alters it and then shrugs and helplessly wonders if Northerners can even understand the Old South . One of the young British cadets landed at Montreal a week ago and as innocent of American concepts and outlook as a babe , advances to you. // He advances straight forward , halts , brings his black British boot to a grinding click , snatches his right hand back to a side-of-the-head British salute , and waits before you and the embarrassed American lawyer-officer . You suddenly see that he is only a lad and recall , with a queer feeling , that 30 weeks hence he will be flying in mortal combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commandant says ' ' At ease ' ' and introduces you ; and when it is over and he is dismissed , the boy unexpectedly says , ' ' Well - Carry on , Sir ! ' ' and marches off under his own power . He leaves you and the American officer a little uncertain who is to do the carrying on . And so the commandant suddenly has not only ' ' foreigners ' ' to contend with but Britishers , too . And he makes up his mind , as a Southern gentleman should , to see the job through , as Jeb Stuart would have done , or Marse Robert ( Robert E. Lee ) himself . He hopes his Southern boys will get the same treatment wherever they are , and is pretty sure they will. // Meanwhile , the new draft act has gone into effect . This queer , half-formed , impromptu Army of America is just finding itself . It is an odd army . In 1917 there was a declared war , there were patriotic slogans , speeches , bands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Anthem . It is oddly prosaic today without fanfare , let alone a declaration of war . Selectees were told it would only last a year , and then the period was increased . He gets $21 a month for the first four months and then $30 . Many Americans , even now , are not convinced that a real emergency exists . Gen. George C. Marshall , chief of staff , argues that there is now sufficient equipment for training purposes. // War industries have made acute housing shortages . At San Diego Mrs. Pauline Kensinger and Mrs. Elvira Eddy with their four children live in two medium-size two-wheel trailers . The government has sponsored the first experimental trailer community here at Consolidated Aircraft , with others to follow - 146 of these gray and silver affairs on one side of the park , comfortable ' ' San Diego Defense Dormitories ' ' for 680 single men on the other side - at $5 a week , or $3. 50 if two share a room . The stiff palm leaves click overhead like porcupine quills. // ' ' May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I might . So many odd things had happened to them since they set up living in a government bus that the arrival of an out-of-town correspondent seemed comparatively trivial . They were young and merry . You could see it was a bit of a lark . Every once and while , Mrs. Elvira explained , she would catch her husband ' s eye and they would laugh for no good reason. // Where did the children sleep ? In the other room. // The other room ? Why yes . . . those closet doors came out and snapped together , dividing the diminutive apartment into two smaller sections . The kitchenette seats unfolded into a Pullman bed and the children slept there . The sofa came out into the other end of the trailer into a bed , too , for the grown-ups . There was a gasoline cooker , a sink , a small kerosene heater for winter and any spare space turned into ingenious drawers and closets . Outside the glorious California sky made all the outdoors your living room . Mrs. Elvira explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven and Jerry would be six - tomorrow . There was one disappointment at the trailer though , she said . There wasn ' t enough electricity to ' ' pull ' ' a waffle iron though it would ' ' pull ' ' a toaster all right. . . . // I looked back as the screen door slammed behind me . Elvira Eddy ' s rubber-tired edifice sat under a palm tree which rustled in the breeze like a big feather duster . Outside it looked ridiculously small . . . . And yet , inside , it hadn ' t seemed so . I couldn ' t figure it out. // Two months before Pearl Harbor in 1941 America churned with preparedness , with shortages , and also with the poverty left over from the Great Depression and dust bowl . <> <> Eleven Mile Corner , Ariz. // The Reeds started out for California recently , but turned back . They burned out the carburetor of their 1932 Chevrolet and felt they couldn ' t risk the desert with a baby . Migratory farm labor averages about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-hour day . Now they pause at the Farm Security Administration migratory labor camp here . Farm machinery has wiped out thousands of jobs . There are 1. 5 million tractors in use in America now ( six times as many as 1920 ) and nearly every one has pushed a family off a farm. // Any account of ' ' Inside America ' ' in this historic summer of 1941 must mention them , and migrants like the Reeds , and squatters ' shacks , made of tins cans and plywood , on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. // ' ' Hit was the droughts that finally dusted me , and after that I couldn ' t git a-holt , ' ' Ralph Neal tells me , a slim , quiet little man with a sun-baked neck . He looks like an etching by Thomas Benton . He married at 23 and has five children .

Ralph Neal tells me that the Bentonville , Ark. , bank failed . He owned 50 acres and rented another 250 . He lost the farm , sold most of his household goods , paid most of his debts , and had $60 left. // ' ' So I paid a feller $30 to git me to Arizony , ' ' he said . As I start to leave , he volunteers : ' ' There was a piece about me in a paper back East . Is there a paper called ' Life ' ? Yes , that ' s hit ; I gis remembered the name .

The Birmingham bus is an hour and 20 minutes late . . . . Saturday night traffic . This broken down sofa on which I sit , outside the one pump gasoline station , holds three men . The others look at it jealously . A girl inside sells soda pop. // Up the road , out of the dark , pushed by two Negroes , comes a battered Plymouth . They dig their toes in and when they reach the pump stand panting . We don ' t say anything . The girl comes out . There is a glass jar on top of the pump with an electric light on it and beetles zooming around . She pulls a lever back and forth slowly and the red rises in the jar . She fills it . Then the level slowly drops . One gallon . That ' s all . Twenty-one cents . No word is spoken ; it might all be pantomime . Now it ' s time to start . One man sits inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an explosion . But it stops . A stage car could not hang fire so dramatically . Suddenly it begins to pop . The man swings in . It goes off , exploding noisly into the night , like a stuttering machine gun. // Nobody in our crowd laughs . Nobody comments . One-gallon customers are common . All Americans aren ' t prosperous , are they ? Wonder when that bus will come ? <> <> Shasta Dam , Redding , Calif. // I wish you could see this dam now . It may be completed in 1944 . It is one of the breathtaking spectacles in America : set down in mountains , groined into bedrock amid manzanita bush , digger pine , and scrub oak . This is the old gold-rush country and you can still see men panning in the icy clear ripples further upstream . The gravel plant here has a gold-saving device. // Aluminum is probably , at this moment , more important than any other single metal in the world . After the war it will still be important . The agonizing race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get more electricity out of the waters . You can ' t have airplanes unless you have aluminum and you can ' t have aluminum unless you have power . There is a shortage of aluminum pots and pans at stores . There has been a collection of old aluminum all over the nation . Instead of a fancied annual requirement of 400 million pounds , the present goal is 1. 4 million . This scarcity is an index of the rapid rate of expansion of the defense program , which seems to take the experts so by surprise . . . <> <> On board train , eastbound // I never knew a time when people would talk more willingly about public affairs . It reflects the national mood . America is making up its mind . You get the sense of it everywhere . It is like being in a room with a ticking parcel .
