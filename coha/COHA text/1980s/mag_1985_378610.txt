Despite rich soil and an extended Caribbean growing season , Puerto Rico has not managed to produce enough food to sustain itself since the U.S. Army seized the island from Spain in 1898 . Almost 70% of the commonwealth 's food is imported ; the government spends $1.2 billion a year buying groceries from abroad for its 3.3 million citizens . Local officials have tried without much success to stimulate food production . Though the commonwealth has spent $60 million to develop rice farming , only 3,000 acres have been brought into production . <P> Last week still another attempt was on the verge of being plowed under in a contentious dispute with an Israeli-directed experimental farm . The commonwealth 's secretary of agriculture Antonio Gonzalez Chapel has cut off the government 's credit line for April-Agro Industries Inc. , which is $33 million in debt , and announced that the commonwealth will handle the farm 's winter harvest next month . April-Agro has refused to surrender , appealing to Governor Rafael Hernndez-Coln . <P> April-Agro 's enterprising president , Morris Demel , 50 , a Polish-born Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Castro 's takeover , planned to grow produce on arid southern coast farmland once used for sugar cane . Importing five Israeli agronomists and applying drip-irrigation methods developed on Israeli kibbutzim , Demel initially wanted to devote 5,000 acres to fruits and vegetables . But seven years after he began the project , only 1,000 acres are under cultivation . <P> The government withdrew its support after the high-cost farm project had defaulted on its loans and seemed to have little prospect of ever reaching solvency . Critics charged that instead of concentrating on popular products like honeydew melons , peppers and tomatoes , April-Agro grew too many other crops , including plantains and cabbage . Demel counters that he has created a new export market for Puerto Rican produce . In 1979-80 , when April-Agro began , the island grew only about 3,600 tons of tomatoes a year , valued at just $1.4 million ; hardly any of the crop was fit for export . But in the six months ending in May of this year , exports reached 4,150 tons and sold for $2.6 million . <P> Demel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neglect for agriculture that began with Operation Bootstrap in the 1950s , when the commonwealth began steering its economy away from almost total dependence on sugar cane toward a more diversified industrial base in electronics and light manufacturing . Some observers believe that the island 's agriculture is still wedded psychologically to sugar and is not truly interested in any other crop . Says Fernando Santiago , operator of a 600-acre farm in Santa Isabel : " Agriculture does n't believe in vegetables . "
