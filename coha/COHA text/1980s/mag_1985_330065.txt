" It 's too late . They already took it , you understand ? My farm 's gone . " <P> Those words were spoken by a luckless grower in The River , one of a recent spate of Hollywood movies about hard times on the farm . But while those down- home films , which also include Country and Places in the Heart , are fiction , the dramas they depict are painfully true to life . Mired in perhaps the deepest farm slump since the Great Depression , American families are being driven from their land in growing numbers at a time when much of the rest of the U.S. is enjoying prosperity . Some 20,000 farms have been auctioned off since 1981 , and the toll is rising . " There will be a bloodbath of farm foreclosures this year , " says Washington Economist John Schnittker , a former Under Secretary of Agriculture . <P> Among the most serious problems facing the American farmer is the strength of the dollar , which is making American agricultural products too expensive in world markets . U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , compared with a record $43.8 billion in 1981 . Cargill , one of the world 's largest grain traders , has shown in recent weeks how topsy-turvy world agricultural trade has become . The company briefly considered buying Argentine wheat at $113 a ton and selling it to U.S. flour mills . Even with about $19- per-ton freight charges and $8-a-ton duty , the Argentine product would have been cheaper than U.S. wheat , which was selling for $150 a ton . After an outburst of protest in the farm belt , Cargill canceled the deal . <P> Hard-pressed farmers now face an additional worry  --  the prospect of the most sweeping shake-up of Government agricultural policies in half a century . Since the Depression , Washington has poured more than $115 billion into propping up agricultural prices through subsidies and related forms of assistance . Last year alone , federal farm programs cost $7.3 billion , and this year they could run as high as $15 billion . Next month the Reagan Administration will propose to Congress a drastic overhaul of the whole costly system of price and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7 billion a year from the federal budget deficit and would mean dramatic changes in American farming . Says Agriculture Secretary John Block : " We need to become competitive in pricing and selling our products and get away from controlled production . " <P> The Administration proposal , which would replace the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 that expires next Sept. 30 , would sharply pare back subsidies over the next five years . It would slash price-support levels and phase out payments that now bolster the earnings of producers of such major commodities as wheat and corn . In addition , it would cut federal outlays to growers who are paid to leave their land fallow in order to hold down the supply of crops and thus keep prices firm . <P> The controversial proposals have already ignited a fierce debate . Says Schnittker : " The Administration has laudable objectives in facing up to where we have to go , but it is incredibly naive to believe that you could jump there in a year or two .
