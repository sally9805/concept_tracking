A ny Wednesday afternoon golfer can beat any other Wednesday afternoon golfer if he will only learn to capitalize on his opponent 's hang-ups . The street term for it , I suppose , is " cheating . " But you and I , being somewhat more refined , are going to use the expression , " playing underhanded . " No , this will not be your standard-type chicanery . You know what I mean . Carelessly stepping on theother golfer 's lost ball and burying it in the mud . Or clumsily kicking it under a pile of leaves . Or absently pulling brush over it . Nor would we consider anything so crude as waving the flag so the shadow flickers across the cup when he 's about to putt . Or pointing just as he strokes the ball , leaving him to come through wondering if it 's a UFO or a wasp lowering its flaps for a landing on his neck . ( Which reminds me of a fellow I knew , briefly , who went so far as to put honey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing him good luck before a game . This not on  --  ly kept the other guy busy ; he himself was never bothered by flying insects . ) As for making sure your victim 's longer shots go in any direction but the right one , we wo n't be stooping to anything so crass as openly dodging behind a tree or the golf cart , or lying prone and wrapping our arms around our heads as he takes his practice swings . Such crudities went out with the wooden shaft . At least in my repertoire . Not that I did n't cut my teeth , shall we say , on such practices . But one specific incident was to change my whole approach . In our regular Wednesday afternoon foursome we have  --  or had  --  one of those " para-noise-iacs . " Or  --  dinarily , Ed would n't turn his head at a sonic boom in the next room . But on the golf course with a club in his hands , everyone is supposed to breathe out of only one nostril .

Anyway , Stan had got fed up with all these " noise " alibis . So on this particular occasion , just as Ed was in the throes of a crucial putt , Stan cut loose a sneeze . Not just any old common everyday run-of-the-mill sneeze . This had to be the doggonedest sneeze ever to fall upon the ears of man . The racket , we later learned , had been augmented somewhat by means of a duck call concealed in Stan 's handkerchief . While the result was nothing short of beautiful ( Ed having to use a 9-iron to chip back to the green ) , and Ed ended up with high score Stan had only to take a deep breath after that for Ed 's ball to shoot past the cup without so much as looking in ) , I decided this was going too far . Especially when Ed showed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , started me thinking .

" On the future of the world and the church : " I see some unpleasant years ahead , financially , socially and polit ically . It keeps getting worse . I think the church is pretty soft . Right now it 's popular to be a Christian . We even have a Chris  --  tian president . But Christians are going to face some tribulation in the years ahead . And there is an awful lot of doctrine that leads a person to think that if things hap  --  pen that are bad , then there must be something wrong in their rela  --  tionship with God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . The Chris  --  tian community is pretty weak today . What will happen when real trouble comes ? " There are few people better pre  --  pared to talk about trouble , few people who have survived the fieryordeal that Merrill Womach has weathered . He has survived with  --  out a hint of bitterness . He does n't dwell on the pain , the stares of others , or what might have been . Instead he talks about the mercy of God , a mercy he feels allowed him to survive the accident and contin  --  ue to spread hope and joy to people through his songs and his testi  --  mony . When one suggests that he must have been born with lots of moxie to begin with , Merrill wo n't deny that he has a streak of perse  --  verance . But he quickly adds , " I would be nothing but a pile of ashes in the Oregon forest without God 's intervention . Every breath I take is given by Him .

She admits at times she wishes she could ride her horse again or go skiing , but one of her deepest longings is to be able to give a hug and to be able to feel one in return .

The women were elegant in their long velvet gowns and jewels round their necks and on their fingers . You can just see it , ca n't you , son ? Well , so could Summer Nighthawk , for she had come into town at dusk with her five-year-old boy clinging to her hand , and was standing in the shadow of this very building were sit  --  ting in . She watched for a couple of hours , seeing all the fine people talking and dancing . We 'll never know why she came to town , or what she had in mind before she came . All we know is what she did . Along about 11:00 , she took the little boy across the street and walked slow  --  ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verander were so dumb  --  founded they just stopped their talk  --  ing and watched her . She was dressed in her best buckskins , intricately bead  --  ed and brushed clean of dust and dirt , and the longish skirt swished rhythmi  --  cally as she climbed the stairs . Her raven hair was carefully combed and hung down in a single braid almost to her waist . In a word , she was strikingly beautiful , even regal looking , if you know what I mean . The boy was scared stiff , so his eyes was wide and everyone could see they was blue . His hair was blond , bleached almost white . Except for the high wide cheekbones and the first hint of a Roman nose to come later in life , he did n't look Indian at all . He walked stiff and straight as a lodge-pole pine , not looking neither to left nor right . Summer Nighthawk walked right up to Johnny Aurora , dropped her head courteously , and then looked straight up into his eyes . He saw the smolder  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubt she still loved him . And he knew that down where his own soul really lived he loved her , too . Before he could say anything , she began to speak in her own language . There was n't no one in that room who knew what she said , but Johnny did . " The boy is now five years old and ready to leave the women 's camp . He needs a father much more than I need a son . Take him . " And then the floodgates burst like a beaver dam before a spring freshet . All the pent-up emotions of three lonely years spent themselves in a long wail  --  ing cry . To give him credit , Johnny Aurora opened his arms to take her and the boy into them , but Summer Nighthawk was gone , fleeing that alien world , leaping gracefully down the ve  --  randa steps , long braid trailing in the wind , the ululating and eerie mourning cry floating back to them on the sum  --  mer breeze . It was a little while before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a moment I thought I could hear once more Summer Nighthawk 's mournful cry over the soughing of the trees . But I could n't , and I never heard her again . I did n't need to , really , for all I had to do was close my eyes to hear the lilting lament which now sounded almost beautiful to my ears . When I opened them , the fire was a glowing pile of embers throwing a red and awesome light onto the features of Jimmy Decatur . I saw now the blue eyes and the high cheekbones and the nose which indeed had grown strong in the shape men call Roman . And I knew that the trapper who had struck it rich in the Black Hills of South Dakota was not named Johnny Aurora at all .

He reads the golf  --  ing magazines religiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving range when he ca n't get a match . You remember the story of the four  --  some teeing up with a highway to the left of the fairway ? One of them hooked badly , his ball disappearing so far down the road they did n't bother look  --  ing . But the group had no more than reached the green than the sheriff came up , demanding to know if one of them had driven out of bounds . " Yes , " con  --  fessed the guilty golfer , " my ball hooked into the road . " " That ball struck the windshield of a car , " said the sheriff , " and the preg  --  nant woman driver is in the ditch in pretty bad shape . What are you going to do about it ? " After thinking it over for a minute , the fellow said , " I think I 'll move my right hand back a little more . " That could have been Stan . My approach here is quite simple . On about the third hole , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I know what it is you are doing wrong . " This comes as something of a sur  --  prise , as he is usually low man and is n't aware that he has been doing anything wrong . But he wo n't ask what it is , of course ; he 'll blamed well figure it out for himself . I 've seen him change his grip , his stance , his backswing , even take a booklet out of his bag and study it . And I have happily watched his game deteriorate until one day on the puny par 3 at White Rock , with the tee and green separated by a mere 115 yards of water , his drive barely made it to thepond . " Well , I 'm a &%$#**!"; he fumed . " I 've never done that before ! " Perhaps not , but he did it three more times before throwing the offending club into the water and selecting another . When two more balls joined the other four , he threw his entire outfit in , bag and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my relief ( I only wanted to beat him , not lose him ) , he turned around and came back . But it was only to take off his shoes and throw them in . After this strategy wore thin ( Stan had bought a complete new outfit by the next week ) , quite by accident ( although it does prove what can be ac  --  complished by keeping your head down and your eyes open ) I discovered that Stan has a deathly fear of snakes . There had been this green plastic water hose lying half buried in the grass directly in front of the tee . To get it out of the way I gave it a yank , just as poor Stan was unwinding from his backswing . His club went farther than the ball . Even after he had been assured that it was n't a 50-foot python and we had located his driver ( I have looked for plenty of lost bails in my day , but this was my first time looking for a lost club ) , Stan 's next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim is what I call a pants addict . Let Jim be on the tee and let a girl line up her putt on the green as much as 400 yards ahead , and the game comes to a halt until she straightens up . Jim was about to try a 20-foot putt one day when near our green a girl in hot pants bent over to tee up her ball . It 's the only time I ever saw a putt back up . By now , if you have grasped the fun  --  damentals of this new approach to the game , you 're probably ahead of me . But my favorite way of increasing Jim 's handicap is to wait until he 's tak  --  ing his practice waggles on the tee . Then I whisper hoarsely to the others , " You would n't believe what happened in the elevator yesterday . I was alone , see , when this lovely young thing gets on carrying a negligee over her arm . " ( Jim 's waggling stops . ) " She says she just finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting on the tenth floor to shoot her in the negligee and she 's running late . " ( Jim has put his club down . ) " And she said since there were only the two of us in the elevator , she wondered if I would mind if she . .. go ahead and hit , Jim , this will wait . " " No , no , " pants old Jim . " What hap  --  pened ? " But I insist that he go ahead . So he hurries his drive and we never do find the ball . The odd thing is , he invariably hooks  --  and Jim is a natural-born slicer . There are times when one of our regulars ca n't make it and we end up with a sub . I always hope it is Charlie . Charlie is one of those immaculate dressers , always punctual , fastidious to a fault in his personal hygiene . All it takes to throw him off his game is to say  --  in fun , of course ? " When you get upwind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Right Guard is n't playing Wide Receiver today . " Charlie always laughs , but whenever he raises his arms from then on we can see him taking advantage of the oppor  --  tunity to check . And it 's not hard to beat a man who swings with his nose stuck in his armpit . Now there 'll be times , of course , when all one knows about an adversary is his name . And there goes your big fat new approach to the game , you are saying . Not necessarily . If you keep your ears open you can have his ball bouncing merrily past the out-of-bound stakes in no time . Example : One fellow that came in off the street made the mistake of men  --  tioning that this would be his first round since breaking his arm . Six holes later , when it was beginning to look as if , even favoring his recently healed wing , he would be nailing our collective hides to the clubhouse door and tuck  --  ing our cash into his wallet , I again called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the walk over to the seventh tee I lagged behind to pick up a seasoned branch from beneath a poplar tree . While the victim was busy hunting the ideal spot to position his tee , I was as busy looking for a slight depression over which I could position my dried branch . So it happened that just as he came through with his drive I acciden  --  tally stepped on this stick , which broke with a terrible cracking sound . The guy 's club came through fine , only his hands were n't holding it . With a horrible guttural yell he had clutched his right arm above the elbow and bent nearly to the ground . Even after I ex  --  plained and had apologized for my clumsiness , the gingerly way he swung from then on assured us he would n't be having his hand out at the finish . Even I do n't play every Wednesday . After something like that duck-call deal a member will vow never to play another round with that so-and-so , and this time he really means it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't show the following week . Then I get a phone call , " Where were you last Wednesday ! We had to use a sub . " Well , from now on they can keep their sub , because I 'm not playing another round with those so-and-sos . And this time I mean it . Not after what they pulled Friday . It was one of those Scotch affairs where the wives play and the men get their partners by throwing a shoe into a pile and pairing up with the woman who pulls it out . The day before , my wife had asked what I 'd be wearing . " To make sure it 's clean , " she ex  --  plained . Any other time I could have gone in burlap boxing shorts without her raising an eyebrow . But as this was the highlight of the season at the club , her reason sounded plausible . I told her I would be wearing my off-white walk  --  ing shorts , the ones that give me that long , lean look . As I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally wanted to look long and lean . You understand . ) My partner , who was to make every other shot , turned out to be the type to make a man want to throw rocks at Cheryl Ladd . ( You understand that , too , do n't you ? ) And to establish the fact that she had selected the shoe not only of a long , lean hunk of man but a gentleman as well , I let her take the first drive . It was the longest ball I had ever seen a woman hit , except on TV . For the icing on the cake , not only was I long , lean and gentlemanly , she had also tied up with a real golfer to boot . The green lay some 250 yards due east , or roughly 50 yards beyond my previous capabilities . But by really pouring the persimmon to the Golden Ram I had bought especially for this spectacular , I just might make it . The ball , however , not only went due south into the woods , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more demoralizing draft down around my nether region . Checking as casually as possible , sure enough , the fly of my off-white shorts that give me the long , lean look stood wide , wide open . Although I could n't have found my ball with a bloodhound , under the pretense of looking I slipped behind a tree and shored up my zipper . My part  --  ner in the meantime dropped another ball and drove to the green . After I missed the putt and she sank it , it was my turn to tee off . And you must know how much I wanted to atone for that shot into the woods . And you must believe that I gave it all I had . But I did n't see the distance of my drive , or the direction , if indeed it had a direction . My concentration had gone from such minor matters to the Continued on following page more important concern of that same horrifying draft in the same nether region . Bending over to pick up my tee confirmed my worst fears  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , that shot into the woods proved to be my best effort of the game . You may not know this , but try  --  ing to keep the right elbow over the fly can raise all kinds of hell with the swing . Especially when one is preoc  --  cupied with the thought of his " bud  --  dies " stooping so low as to bribe his wife to tamper with his zipper . As I said , that 's it . I 'll never play another round with those guys  --  never , And I mean it . Of course , this is only Monday . And I have until Wednesday .
