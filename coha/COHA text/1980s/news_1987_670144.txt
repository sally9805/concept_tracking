WASHINGTON  --  After years of worrying about the health of the U.S. economy , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is beginning to worry about a bigger problem : the growing possibility of world-wide recession . Global economic growth has been slowing for almost two years , and the anemia may be reaching a critical stage . The latest forecasts show that growth in the major industrial economies is likely to slip to 2. 3% or less this year from 2. 4% last year . Both fall below the 3% minimum growth that the International Monetary Fund says the world must maintain over time to sustain growing trade , control unemployment in West Germany and other exporting countries , and help debtor nations such as Mexico shoulder their debts . " Sluggish growth in the industrialized world already has affected the export markets of the heavily indebted countries , slowing their return to full economic and financial health , " Mr. Volcker told a Senate Banking subcommittee this week . " And the clear danger now . . . is that growth may be slowing further . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , the U.S. currency plunged yesterday . U.S. stocks and bonds also declined on nervousness that a falling dollar will lead to higher interest rates . There is no obvious spur to growth on the horizon . West Germany ' s economy is faltering , and Bonn is refusing to stimulate it . Japan ' s economy is stagnant . And Third World countries , squeezed by low commodity prices and heavy debt-service burdens , can ' t import much . Washington had been hoping for some lift here at home from an expected improvement in the U.S. trade deficit , but that is far behind schedule . " It ' s hard to see where in the world the growth will be coming from , " says Robert Hormats , a former State Department economic official now at Goldman , Sachs &; Co . Like Mr. Volcker , Treasury Secretary James Baker and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus are worried about the continuing sluggishness . The issue was a major topic at this week ' s meeting of finance ministers from the seven largest industrial democracies here . Slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baker asserts . " This is what we ' ve been warning about . " Not everyone , of course , believes that a recession is imminent  --  or even likely . But many private economists , though not as concerned as finance ministers and central bankers , also are becoming increasingly wary . Alan Stoga , an analyst at Henry A. Kissinger Associates , says , " There ' s a growing sense of risk in the international economy , and it ' s all on the downside . " If growth rates in the major industrial countries slip much further , the governments might well move quickly to stimulate their economies . " They may not be in time to avoid a slump , but they can take action to deal with it , " says Robert Lawrence , a Brookings Institution economist . " In the end , we ' ll wind up simply muddling through . " However , the U.S.  --  often in the past the " locomotive " that pulls the world economy out of recessions  --  can ' t easily come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large that Washington can ' t afford to widen it to help stimulate demand , as it did in 1983 and 1984 . With the dollar falling , the Fed can ' t ease monetary policy . In fact , Mr. Volcker warned this week that the Fed may have to tighten up if the dollar keeps sliding . Such tightening would raise U.S. interest rates , slow growth and possibly derail the stock market . Some economists worry that even moderate U.S. growth may be a mixed blessing . Rimmer de Vries , the chief international economist for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , warns that with Germany and Japan in a slump , almost any significant American growth would pull more imports into the U.S. An accelerated inflow would impede Washington ' s ability to reduce the " intolerable " trade deficit  --  $170 billion last year  --  that could spark economic instability , Mr. de Vries says . The continuing decline in the dollar is an additional complication . A lower dollar makes U.S. goods more competitive and helps reduce America ' s trade deficit , but it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily dependent upon exports . Weakness abroad reduces demand for U.S. products . David Hale , the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services , says the risks are being compounded by the slowness of policy makers in the major industrial countries to set a common strategy . " No one has a clear way out , " he says . " We ' re seeing a crisis of global policy making probably without precedent since the 1920s . " The policy prescription is clear , but nobody wants to take the medicine . Mr. Volcker and others have outlined repeatedly a three-part growth strategy . To head off further economic contraction , West Germany and Japan need to stimulate their economies to increase imports , and the U.S. must try harder to reduce the deficit , damp consumption and stimulate savings and investment . Until recently , however , all three governments have been resisting any major new moves . At this week ' s meeting of finance ministers , though , Japan promised a credible stimulus package . Germany still is balking , contending that spurring more demand at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economic growth potential in a country like Germany , " says Karl-Otto Poehl , the president of the West German central bank . Some private economists believe that Germany may already have missed its chance to save its own economy from a slump . Slow growth in Germany can spill over to other European economies , particularly the French . The new accord , which reaffirmed an agreement reached last February in Paris , clearly didn ' t impress the financial markets . " Further large , quick declines of the dollar can push interest rates sharply higher , weaken U.S. growth and growth abroad , bringing a slowdown or recessions to most countries , " Allen Sinai , the chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , warned yesterday . " This contingency is one in five . " Analysts fear that slowing growth could increase frictions between the U.S. and its major economic allies  --  possibly as early as the annual seven-nation economic summit conference in Venice June 8 through 10 . Although the global economic problem is expected to be high on the agenda , solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with expectations just a few months ago , when forecasters seemed convinced that the world was on its way back toward steady long-term economic growth . As Mr. Stoga notes , the consensus analysis then held that the combination of a lower dollar , falling oil prices and declining interest rates would generate renewed world-wide economic growth without risk of reviving inflation . And leaders of the major industrial nations thought that they had a common strategy for dealing with the economic problems . " Everyone was relatively optimistic , " Mr. Stoga recalls . But now , the falling dollar has crimped German and Japanese exports and economic growth and damped expected investment . The decline in oil prices has forced oil-producing countries to slash imports and has hurt the industrial countries that produce these goods . Debt-ridden countries haven ' t made the gains some analysts expected . Falling commodity prices have left many Third World countries with less revenue per dollar of exports . And protectionism has increased world-wide . As a result , the major international economic organizations  --  the IMF , the Paris-based Organization for Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tariffs and Trade  --  all have trimmed their world-wide forecasts for 1987 . Last fall , the IMF , for example , predicted 1987 growth of 3. 1% for industrial countries , but new estimates released yesterday reduced this year ' s forecast to 2. 3% . At the IMF ' s Interim Committee Meeting yesterday , Nigel Lawson , the British chancellor of the exchequer , primarily blamed the gloomier forecast on the dollar ' s slump and a resulting slowing of domestic demand in major countries . The adjustments needed by industrial countries to compensate for the " massive exchange-rate realignment that has taken place won ' t happen smoothly , " he said . Mr. Stoga warns that " economic growth in the industrial countries  --  and the consequent growth in world trade  --  are simply not adequate " to fulfill current global economic needs . " If these dynamics continue , " he says , " it could eventually lead to a world recession . " Like many other analysts , Mr. Stoga believes that the most immediate impact will be on debt-ridden countries . The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and Japan fall into a slump , they almost certainly will cut back their demand for Third World goods . That , along with a continuing slump in commodity prices , would leave debtor countries unable to earn enough to cover their debt-service costs  --  increasing demands for more protectionism and further straining the global financial system . The upshot could be " a more confrontational period in creditor-debtor relations , " he says . There is also scant hope for progress on another problem  --  that the U.S. , West Germany and Japan will be able to move very far toward eliminating the huge trade and payments imbalances that are threatening global economic stability . So far , the two-year decline in the dollar hasn ' t produced the desired adjustments in the three countries ' trade balances . And despite talk of policy changes , nothing has happened yet . Meanwhile , the outlook isn ' t getting any brighter . Goldman Sachs ' s Mr. Hormats sees " a progressive grinding-down of growth " that will continue to crimp living standards , both in the industrial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easily could get out of hand  --  and greater problems could develop .
