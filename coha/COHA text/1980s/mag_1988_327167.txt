Until this week , for every 100 people jostling on board the Continental Boeing 747 en route from New York to Los Angeles , chances were that 90 of them had bought their tickets on the cheap . The other ten had shelled out as much as $866 . The business travelers had probably paid $550 , the pleasure trippers $362 , the bargain hunters as little as $159 . The only people who did any better were the frequent flyers who cashed in their mileage and paid nothing at all . <P> But from now on , a lot of passengers are going to be paying more . Last week , following Continental 's lead , major airlines threw out their so-called junk fares , which offered discounts on tickets purchased three to seven days in advance . Since most last-minute flyers are business travelers , few vacationers would be affected . But at the same time , Continental was tinkering with its MaxSaver fares , the popular , deep-discount tickets that must be bought two weeks in advance and require a Saturday-night stay . Starting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 each way . <P> One by one the other airlines followed suit , although at week 's end Midway and Southwest Airlines were still resisting the increases and Eastern had raised only some of its fares . Many airlines have consolidated their market share in recent years by buying smaller companies and aggressively cutting prices . Now , with air traffic up a surprising 8% last month over a year ago , the carriers are testing to see whether rising demand can withstand higher prices . <P> " I do n't see any way of combatting this , other than not traveling , " says Stuart J. Faber , director of the National Association of Business Travel Agents . Those who have no choice could find their travel costs rising roughly 15% to 20% . " Now I 'll really get hurt if someone calls on Tuesday and says , ' We have to have you in New York on Friday , ' " says Gregory Boyd , a California venture capitalist . His solution : buy partially refundable tickets in advance and swallow the penalty if he cancels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll book a week in advance  --  $600 round trip  --  and take the 25% penalty . Then , even if I do n't go , I 'm better off . " <P> Saddled with a reputation for erratic performance , Continental pioneered the junk fares last February to woo business flyers . " Our first order was to restore the quality of the operation and then offer a fare structure to entice the frequent flyer back , " explains Continental president Martin Shugrue . Other airlines soon followed , but reluctantly . " We never thought these fares made much economic sense , " says Al Becker , spokesman for American Airlines . " We matched Continental for competitive reasons . " <P> The decision last week to abandon the discounts reflects a new cockiness at Continental : complaints to the Department of Transportation are down 80% since last year . Says Shugrue : " Continental has improved its service to the point where we can be truly competitive and price our fares on a competitive basis . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
