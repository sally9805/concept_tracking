Although those buried in the Bitburg cemetery probably did not take part in the massacre , which occurred in June 1944 in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane , the involvement of the division appears to have escaped the attention of West German and American officials who have been doing research on the graveyard since protests broke out in the United States. // The announcement on April 11 that Mr. Reagan would lay a wreath at the cemetery next weekend brought an outcry from Jewish organizations , veterans ' groups and others because of the presence of 49 Waffen SS soldiers among the dead .
