The common theme of who owns the Government emerges from the witnesses appearing before the Iran-contra congressional hearings ( ( NATION , June 15 ) ) . Retired generals feel a sufficient proprietary sense to conduct foreign policy initiatives on behalf of the U.S. in the Caribbean and the Middle East . Active-duty officers , an ambassador and an Assistant Secretary of State project this same air of haughtiness . Perhaps this stand is best represented by Fawn Hall . She justified shredding documents and other actions she knew were improper and irregular by her belief in the correctness of Oliver North 's " initiatives . " Does Hall think that she , Lieut . Colonel North and others who temporarily occupy Government jobs of trust and responsibility are the Government ? These people 's actions are governed by job descriptions and the law . <P> Douglas E. Stouffer <P> Schenectady , N.Y . <P> National Secretaries ' Week should be renamed Fawn Hall Week . This young woman has given the world its most riveting demonstration ever of the near superhuman demands of being a professional secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinned butterfly , she has faced her congressional inquisitors with poise and outlined her activities and opinions with candor , dignity and grace under the pressure of probing examination and political pettifogging . She offers no excuses for her absolute loyalty to her boss or for having provided her unquestioning support in pursuit of his operational goals . Fawn Hall has stolen the Iran-contra show . <P> L. Dee Belveal <P> Mountain View , Calif . <P> I have been watching the Iran-contra hearings , and it appears that the Congress of the U.S. and the contra supporters in the Administration are indeed fighting . But this is a battle that was initiated , continuously provoked and induced by Congress through legislation that is ambiguous in nature . The battle demonstrates to the world that elected officials in the U.S. Congress are not prepared , and seem unwilling , to fight Communism in America 's own hemisphere . My hope is that the American people will learn what a real threat the Sandinista government is not only to neighboring Central American countries but to the U.S. as well . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
