The Chief Justice blasts the " reign of terror " in our cities <P> The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court 's annual report to the convention of the American Bar Association is usually a businesslike survey of problems of court administration , touching on such issues as jurisdiction and clogged dockets . This year , however , was an explosive exception . When Warren Burger stepped to the podium at last week 's A.B . A. meeting in Houston , he zeroed in on a single , highly charged topic-violent crime-and let loose a broadside at the nearly " impotent society " that had failed to come to grips with it . " Why do we show such indignation over alien terrorists and such tolerance for the domestic variety ? " <P> Burger questioned the lawyers . " Are we not hostages within the borders of our own self-styled enlightened , civilized country ? " <P> To combat the " reign of terror in American cities , " the nation 's top judge called for greater stress on the " deterrent effect " of " swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-finality of judgment . " He suggested hiring more prosecutors , defenders and judges so that a defendant could be tried within a few weeks of arrest , rather than months , and get his appeal heard within eight weeks . One round of direct appeals per defendant , he argued , should be enough . <P> After that , subsequent judicial review should be limited to " genuine claims of miscarriage of justice " and should not hinge on " technical errors , unrelated to guilt or innocence . " <P> The Chief Justice 's points appeared to stem from a belief that the " massive safeguards for accused persons " built up by the judicial system in recent decades are out of proportion with the protection now afforded to law abiding citizens . He urged more stringent standards on bail to prevent the release of suspects likely to commit a crime between their arrest and trial . For those who end up behind bars , he renewed his familiar proposals for better facilities , improved training , and more sensible incentives to " learn the way out of prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " damage-control program " would be enormously costly . But he maintained that it was " as much a part of our national defense as the budget of the Pentagon . " Many in his A.B.A. audience , which interrupted him eight tunes to applaud , obviously agreed , and so did much of America . The New York Times pointed out , in one of the many editorial page responses that the speech provoked , that Burger touched a nerve with " an entire generation of citizens who dread the city streets and in their fear feel deprived of elementary rights . " David Armstrong , president-elect of the National District Attorneys Association , praised the speech for " exposing the cracks in our system before they get worse and the system breaks apart .
