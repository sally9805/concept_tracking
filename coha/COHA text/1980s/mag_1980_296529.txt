OPENING NIGHT April 13 , PBS , 10 p.m . E.S.T. <P> The San Francisco Opera 's new production of Amilcare Ponchielli 's sprawling , lurid La Gioconda last September was a vast undertaking , and PBS station KCET had the wit to record the preparations in a funny , breezy documentary , Opening Night &shy; The Making of an Opera . The camera roams in wig shops and rehearsal rooms , where Baritone Norman Mittelman after fluffing a line complains that the composer wrote it wrong . At the shaky dress rehearsal Kurt Herbert Adler , 75 , the company 's director , notes , at that late hour , that the chorus is posi tioned so that ticketholders on the right can not see the action in a big scene . <P> In the lobby the ushers are getting their orders : " Be very , very careful . Do not touch any customer . If you take a tip that 's up to you , but do not tell anybody . " Backstage a honcho of the costume department is pointing out the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.O. The costumes are new . We have new T shirts . Wear them . " Cosmeticians are making up the cast , many of whom are part-timers . One of them moans , " Right now I 'm cutting vegetables for salads and soups and I just ca n't handle it . " <P> The real drama involves the principals , Tenor Luciano Pavarotti and Soprano Renata Scotto . San Francisco is his territory , the town that virtually takes credit for his American success ; the lady is understandably apprehensive . She is a warm and pretty woman and also a diva who knows the craft of staging and upstaging . From Stage Director Lotfi Mansouri she seeks &shy; and gets &shy; endless reassurance . <P> Pavarotti arrives at the administrative offices swathed in desert robes . He strokes the astonished Adler 's hair affectionately and then drinks the director 's coffee . When he protests , Pavarotti says mildly that it is his coffee . The stage , the opera , the fans are his coffee too , and he knows it . He is in superb voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a compliment is not enough . " <P> The tension bursts over curtain calls . Pavarotti takes a disputed solo bow , so Scotto refuses to take her final bow . As the loudspeaker calls her repeatedly to the stage , she sits in her dressing room , ignoring Mansouri 's just praise and his fervent pleas . There will be no bow . <P> PBS will broadcast the opera as a miniseries , one act each night following the April 13 program . The rare hour is the first one , because Opening Night is the work of people who know the opera world , relish its absurdities and are candid enough to show the temperaments that make it grand .
