This can happen either because the organizers opt to go this route , as occurred when Oklahoma and Nebraska met in the 1979 Orange Bowl , or because a bowl ' s formula makes it inevitable , as is the case with the upcoming Rose Bowl . The folks in Pasadena are locked into pitting the Big Ten and Pac-10 conference champions , which this time means that season-opening opponents Michigan State and Southern Cal will confront one another again on New Year ' s Day. // // There ' s a sense of freshness about this rematch , though , partly because nearly four months will have passed between the time they last met on Labor Day evening and Jan. 1 . Michigan State won the nationally televised Sept. 7 game in East Lansing , 27-13 , but Southern Cal , under new coach Larry Smith , didn ' t really hit its stride until mid-season. // Both teams are better now , and given the different locale and the Big Ten ' s traditional difficulties in Pasadena , it ' s very hard to predict what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher ranking and rate this one a ' ' toss-up. ' ' // The Trojans , of course , don ' t lack for incentive , since they dedicated themselves to getting to the Rose Bowl for a hoped-for second chance at Michigan State. // By succeeding , the teams have set the stage for only the fifth Tournament of Roses rematch . Previously there have been two sweeps , Iowa beating Oregon State twice during the 1956 season and UCLA turning the trick against Michigan in 1982 . A pair of split-decisions both involved UCLA , which upset Michigan State to conclude its 1965 campaign and Ohio State at the tail end of the ' 75 season. // Southern Cal has to feel confident about turning the tables this time , not only because USC has won 17 of its last 18 meetings with Big Ten opponents , but also because of the Pac 10 ' s success in recent Rose Bowls , which rivals the the National League ' s dominance in baseball ' s All-Star Game. // The West Coast team has won with such regularity ( 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons have been put forth . Perhaps the most extensive attempt to list possible explanations was carried in the preseason issue of Inside Sports magazine . The theories attributed the Big Ten ' s struggles to : // *The myriad distractions found in Calfornia // * The former conservatism of Big Ten offenses // * The Rose Bowl ' s natural grass field // * The weather , both in the Midwest , where freezing temperatures discourage outdoor practices , and in California , where beautiful days make it difficult to concentrate on football // * Too much time away from home // * And the Ohio State-Michigan theory , which claims that whenever one of these teams goes to the Rose Bowl , it experiences emotional burnout after playing its rival in the final regular-season game. // The bottom line is that the Big Ten teams don ' t seem to believe in themselves - at least not for a full 60 minutes . This has , of course , become the chief hurdle , and the one that could most challenge Michigan State in its first Rose Bowl appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right sideline this time is the Trojan head coach . Smith visited the Rose Bowl twice before , following the 1969 and ' 71 seasons , as an assistant under Bo Schembechler at Michigan . The Wolverines lost both times. // Michigan State coach George Perles was also an assistant on a team that played in Pasadena ' s Rose Bowl stadium , but the team was the Pittsburgh Steelers , and the game was Super Bowl XIV in 1980 . The Steelers beat the Los Angeles Rams to capture their fourth title in six years , a record partly credited to the vaunted Steel Curtain defense coached by Perles. // When George accepted the job at his alma mater after the 1982 season , he predicted the Spartans would go to the Rose Bowl within five years . This is his fifth year and everything is right on schedule , including the development of rock-ribbed defense , which has led the nation by yielding just 61. 5 rushing yards a game . <> <> Make coaches teachers // Each year firings , forced resignations , or other personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attractive livelihood . Coaches at big-time schools , of course , are handsomely compensated , as was clear when Ohio State agreed to a $471 , 000 settlement with ousted mentor Earle Bruce , whose income sweeteners included TV and equipment contracts. // Money , however , often only further distorts the win-or-else atmosphere that permeates today ' s coaching environment . In a survey conducted by University of Cincinnati researchers , college coaches around the country overwhelmingly said that they should be offered the possibility of earning tenure as college coaches. // Some currently gain tenure as faculty members , but not as coaches , which seems to underline one of the greatest flaws in the way major-college programs operate , which is as virtually autonomous groups . Coaches are coaches , period , but if the system were changed to require them to assume some teaching duties , their value as educators would enhance their security and help redefine their roles in the college community . <> <> Consensus champions not unusual // Those who argue for a major-college playoff may be surprised to learn that identifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy job - at least once the bowls are over. // For the past eight years there has been unanimity among the groups that traditionally confer national champion status - the wire service polls ( both AP and UPI ) , the Football Writers ' Association of America ( FWAA ) , and the National Football Foundation. // There has been agreement , in fact , on 11 of the last 12 champions . The only exception during this period occurred at the end of the 1978 season , when Alabama was a 3-awards-to-1 winner over Oklahoma in a split decision. // The selection of a top team has been simplified by waiting until after the bowls , when a few key matchups can place everything into clearer focus . In 1954 , the FWAA became the first group to wait until the New Year ' s Day results were in before choosing a national champion . The other groups eventually followed suit , with UPI last adopting this procedure in 1974. // It has become such standard operating procedure that few question it anymore , yet including bowl results does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure on the players , who once could look forward to bowls as a fun reward for a good season. // Then , too , the most significant bowls occur so long after the regular season has ended , they almost deserve to be considered as one-game seasons unto themselves . Teams that have improved steadily can go flat in the absence of game action , while others actually put the long pre-bowl rest and preparation period to their advantage. // A prime example of teams losing their edge occurred in the early 1950s , when three teams that won national championships in pre-bowl wire service tabulations , lost in the postseason - Oklahoma in ' 50 , Tennessee in ' 52 , and Maryland in ' 54. // //
