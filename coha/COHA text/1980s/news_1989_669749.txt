The memory and impact of Atlanta ' s first black mayor are still so powerful that a last name is not needed . Indeed , Maynard Jackson Jr. is a near-legend here. // Even after years working in the private sector as a lawyer , Mr. Jackson is still recognized and known throughout the metropolitan Atlanta area . And the rotund candidate , who seems loaded with restless energy , is now an easy favorite to win the nonpartisan election Oct. 3. // // Jackson did not formally announce his campaign until last February , but had been raising money since 1987 . So far , he has raised close to $1. 5 million , mostly through private parties . His financial committee includes black and white business people from some of the oldest , largest corporations in the city. // Sometimes described as a member of Atlanta ' s ' ' black aristocracy , ' ' the former mayor was first elected in 1973 . He left in 1979 during his second term , after the state and city voted to limit mayors to two consecutive terms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coalition of black ministers representing the black community . He has also been endorsed by the AFL-CIO ' s Labor Council in Atlanta , a group of 75 union locals in the 16-county metro area. // Most significant , however , his major opponent - Michael Lomax , the chairman of the Fulton County Commission - abruptly withdrew from the race in early August , leaving Jackson virtually unchallenged . Though the slim , articulate Mr. Lomax has a strong reputation as chairman of the county commission , he was considered the underdog. // Mr. Lomax ' s aggressive campaign linked Jackson to the city ' s high crime rate and accused him of using City Hall connections to further his career as municipal bond lawyer . But even with a series of TV commercials featuring endorsements by prominent Atlantans , Lomax could not chip away Jackson ' s support. // Jackson comes from a long line of preachers , teachers , and social activists that challenged the white power structure of the Old South in 1968 , a few months after the death of Martin Luther King Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entering the Democratic primary race for the United States Senate seat held by Herman Talmadge , a prominent Georgia politician and one of the ' ' good ol ' boys. ' ' // Entering the campaign at the last minute as an unknown , Jackson lost but carried Atlanta by a majority of more than 6 , 000 votes . A year later , he launched a well-organized and ultimately victorious campaign for vice mayor , getting out the black vote by visiting three or four churches each Sunday. // In the 1973 race , he defeated incumbent Mayor Sam Massell , Atlanta ' s first Jewish mayor . As the city ' s first black mayor , Jackson served during a difficult period in Atlanta ' s history . Though the city never exploded into racial riots in the late ' 60s , Atlanta was making a political and social transition from white dominance to black dominance. // A believer in the politics of inclusion , he pressured banks and other long-established institutions to open their boards and membership to minorities and women . He quickly adopted affirmative action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 city jobs. // Though sometimes described as heavy-handed , Jackson proved that a new airport could be built on time and below budget using affirmative-action guidelines. // ' ' Our greatest brick and mortar achievement was building Hartsfield Airport - the largest nonmilitary employer in Georgia , ' ' Jackson boasts . ' ' We simultaneously wrote the book on equal employment opportunities and affirmative action. ' ' // Jackson became a supersalesman for the ' ' city too busy to hate ' ' and a champion for the black community , working to improve city services and create training programs for low-income Atlantans. // DESPITE his accomplishments and the loyalty of black constituents , his tenure as mayor was marred by controversy and internal scandals. // Some of the city ' s police were involved in cheating on a police examination , and A.Reginald Eaves , an old friend appointed by Jackson as public safety commissioner , was implicated . ( Mr. Eaves was later convicted on a federal extortion charge in 1988 . ) Some observers say morale on the police force dropped simultaneously while Atlanta ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe the sometimes confrontational and brash Jackson will avoid the mistakes of the past . As a second-time candidate , he is running on a five-point program : fighting drugs and crime ; better housing for all ; aggressive economic development ; effective well-managed government ; and higher quality of life. // With the increase in city crime and illegal drug use , Jackson ' s No. 1 priority is a comprehensive anticrime program . He proposes a citizen participation program called ' ' Kick Their Assets ' ' to help curb neighborhood drugs and encourage people to report street-corner dealers. // ' ' When someone turns in a dope dealer in their neighborhood , they will get 50 percent of what is confiscated by the police , ' ' Jackson says. // With 85 percent of the city ' s police officers not living in Atlanta , Jackson says he would create a ' ' police housing ' ' program to attract them back to the city .

He has invited US Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp to use Atlanta as a laboratory for tenant-controlled housing. // Jackson describes himself as a hands-on manager , an idea factory , and a practitioner of positive thinking . Despite his six-figure income , he also sees himself as a hard worker and poverty fighter. // Critics , however , view him as a well-heeled lawyer living the good life in a sprawling 15-room mansion in Atlanta ' s most affluent white neighborhood , just a few blocks from the governor ' s mansion . To that criticism he responds , ' ' I was one of six children . My father died when I was 15 and I ' ve worked ever since . I ' ve waited tables , picked tobacco , and sold encyclopedias.
