Other countries , friendly and otherwise , therefore discount the lame ducks , and so does the American permanent bureaucratic mandarinate . There are always exceptions when Washington has to react : Election week 1956 saw the dual disasters of Hungary and Suez , and 1980 was the agony year of hostages in Iran . But in general , the American people tend be born again politically every four ( or occasionally eight ) years. // Are foreign policy issues salient this year ? The pollsters tell us that people normally vote their pocketbooks . The trouble of course is that , whatever the campaign rhetoric , come Jan. 21 , 1989 , the big-ticket foreign policy and national-security items are going to be sitting there waiting for the new man ( and it will be a man , though not for much longer ) . But it is nevertheless optional whether candidates confront such issues . Indeed , debate is actively discouraged by fear of appearing soft on Nicaragua or otherwise wimpish . But on the Sherlock Holmes principle of seeking the dog that did not bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking whether they are ' ' campaignable. ' ' // // Hardest to ignore is the economic package of good and bad news that touches everyone . Last Oct. 19 - Wall Street ' s ' ' Black Monday ' ' - dramatized the biggest news of our era : the pervasive interdependence that alters basic equations of power , affects every government ' s freedom of action , and transforms governance itself . We are deeply into a new age that paradoxically combines a potent nationalist spirit with national impotence to act alone on the big problems that afflict society . An appropriate name for it would be ' ' The Age of Nationalism Without Autonomy. ' ' // Mikhail Gorbachev has been actively talking interdependence , as has Pope John Paul II . President Reagan wanted us to stand tall , but where we are actually standing is in water rising up to our neck , while noticing only the irritating surface creatures nibbling at us . The United States political campaign can not dodge at least some of the egregious symptoms , such as a federal budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and European investments . Fair trade versus free trade is a major issue in the face of huge trade imbalances , as are the portentous transformations in the US productive economy. // At least this is being discussed , if only because of the deep quarrels about remedies . Regional interests , reflected in Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis , differ on oil import fees and protectionist legislation . But not so audible is any serious discussion of porous national boundaries through which $140 billion sloshes daily , across computer screens which for the most part ignore governments . And will there be debate about the fast-growing foreign ownership of massive US assets ( an ancient and honorable custom , by the way , that helped build our transcontinental railroads and early New York skyscrapers ) ? // Equally crucial to our future - and equally hard to squeeze into 30-second TV ' ' sound bites ' ' - are other technology-driven revolutions such as the global warming trend caused by man-made gaseous emissions . Some candidates are sensitive to environmental issues , but only non-candidate Gorbachev seems to be asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fair to ask how anyone can make sense of complexity in a media-driven campaign. // Given the taboo now attaching to the ' ' T ' ' word ( taxes ) it may also be too risky to discuss future consequences and costs . The recent unilateralist mood of Washington makes it equally difficult to prescribe international policy coordination on the greater-than-national problems no single country , however powerful its strategic forces , can solve by itself . Reaganism was an authentic political backlash to Jimmy Carter ' s mournful talk about malaise and limits to US freedom of action , and psychologically it will not be easy to lead the needful public discussion. // Even if multilateralism did become a serious campaign question , making the ' ' internationalist ' ' argument will be tough at a time when cooperative mechanisms like the United Nations suffer from galloping anemia . There are signs of reform and of new common sense , thanks to a not entirely unhealthy backlash from the Western nations as well as emergence of a new middle class of third-world power . After the Walter Mondale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to dodge not only the ' ' T ' ' word but also the taboo ' ' S ' ' word that raises the question of sharing some traditional sovereignty , not only to achieve desirable national goals but to survive. // US-Soviet relations continue to play the role of Hamlet in the larger drama . The Republican Party will be helped by ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , which will probably happen despite internal criticism. // Arms control may be an exception to my low-metabolism rule . There seems little chance for serious reductions in strategic weapons without some agreed limits on the Strategic Defense Initiative . Normally Moscow would wait for a Democratic successor who might walk SDI back into the lab . But Mr. Gorbachev needs a summit as badly as does a lame duck President , and Moscow can help the Republicans with that , as well as with an Afghanistan pullout. // Strategically Nicaragua is a sideshow . But as a Reagan obsession , it promises an unedifying encounter between Republican candidates competing for toughness and Democrats wary of hitting into a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs ticking away right up to election day . The US entered the Iran-Iraq war arena without a visible strategic plan , but has lucked out - so far . A Silkworm missile aimed at a US vessel passing the Strait of Hormuz ' ' envelope ' ' would rip open a political wound . The Arab-Israeli war that has broken out every eight years on the average remains a chronic concern , particularly given that with each outbreak the US and Soviet Union have gone on higher nuclear alert levels. // But US-Israeli-Palestinian relations constitute such a painful domestic issue that , unless the candidates agree to hold hands and jump in together , bipartisan evasive tactics are certain . Ronald Reagan and George Shultz are uncommonly brave to tackle the situation ( which they ignored until TV-magnified violence rang the alarm ) . If through some unlikely miracle they succeed in unfreezing the peace process , that could help the Republicans . One can only say that it will be as popular politically to take a tough line on South Africa as it will be unpopular to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously debated is allied relations . NATO is again in some disarray , but as some wag put it , NATO has never been in array . The planned German-French joint brigade is a significant , if generally unnoticed , event . But in the campaign , US alliances will be mentioned only as sources of European and Japanese free-riding , with US force reductions as potential budgetary salvation. // I for one would welcome a debate on the global political-security options for this country as we head for the 21st century : How to keep strong and be prepared to defend democratic values when they are truly at stake , while cooperating with other democracies and even with the Soviets if and when they want to tamp down local firestorms ? How to break the habit of automatically defending the status quo anywhere in the name of stability and again put this country on the right side of genuine revolutions , while blocking outside mischiefmakers ? // No , those big-ticket issues probably won ' t be debated , except for what can squeeze into a 30-second TV spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only occasionally is a little policy ankle displayed . Indeed , a viewer sometimes feels as if he is at that famous opera audition in which the judges unanimously awarded the prize to the second singer after hearing only the first one sing. // The US is still a great country , and we are fortunate in having such an unusually bright lot among this year ' s crop of candidates . Moreover , the country seems to be lurching back toward the political center , and by and large the serious contenders are singing , ' ' Anything you can do I can do better . ' ' We still face the quadrennial question of how to get leaders worthy of the nation , but can not tolerate a system that can be run only by geniuses. // My namesake once said that while the people retain their virtue and vigilance , no administration by any extreme of wickedness of folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of one administration . In his First Inaugural , Honest Abe also asked , ' ' Why should there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people ? Is there any better or equal hope in the world ? ' ' // //
