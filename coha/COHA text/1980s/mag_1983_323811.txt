Maybe $100 million worth <P> " You wanta buy some gold , but do n't have a safe place to keep it ? No problem . Send me money and I 'll buy the gold and store it for you . Whenever you want it , just ask . " <P> The actual radio sales pitch , broadcast for two years in California and for a few weeks in New York , was a shade more sophisticated than that . But , in essence , that was the offer of Los Angeles Gold and Silver Dealer Alan David Saxon . Would anyone grab at such a flimsy deal ? Some 35,000 investors , dazzled by the lure of precious metals as a hedge against renewed inflation , apparently did . Last week they were regretting it . <P> " What am I going to do ? " asked a distraught Manhattan banker who , at 25 , had invested $25,000 of his parents ' savings with Saxon . He was seeking advice from the office of New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams . A New Jersey caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one weary investigator : " Many of these people even sound well educated and experienced . " <P> The calls were flooding Abrams ' office because he had become suspicious after hearing the radio spots and asked some of his aides to snoop around . Oddly enough , they could find no complaints against Saxon and his firm , Bullion Reserve of North America . It had headquarters in Los Angeles and offices in Dallas and Hong Kong . No one in gold trading in New York seemed to know Saxon well , but his company was paying its bills . On instinct , Abrams ' men asked Richard Arfa , a vice president of Bullion Reserve , to produce financial records . Arfa stalled and questioned Abrams'jurisdiction in the case . <P> The same day , Saxon , 39 , ran a hose from the exhaust pipe of his motorcycle into the sauna of his $685,000 condo in Venice , Calif . He apparently started the engine , then sat in jeans and socks while the sauna filled with carbon monoxide . When his body was found , so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan . It explained that he had killed himself because he could not overcome his mounting business losses . <P> When accountants examined the books of the company , which last week filed a bankruptcy petition , they could not determine what had happened to some $60 million in metal reserves the company had claimed to be holding . Only about $900,000 worth of metal owned by Saxon 's company was found in 200-ft. - deep underground vaults managed by Perpetual Storage Inc. near Salt Lake City . A Brink 's vault in Los Angeles contained an additional $150,000 in metal for Saxon 's company . The Bullion Reserve records showed that the firm had loaned at least $13 million to Saxon and his wife and more to other companies they controlled . According to the California department of corporations , which began an inquiry , the losses could reach $100 million . <P> The California investigators believe that Saxon 's company may never have purchased all the gold that investors paid for , and that Saxon diverted much of his clients ' money to his personal use . He owned another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Mercedes . He had made a $95,000 deposit on a Learjet . He apparently had lost $1 million in an attempt to buy the Commercial Bank of California in West Hollywood and save it from bankruptcy . The bank failed last May , and its demise has led to numerous disputes and even lawsuits among its directors .
