Saturday morning was come , and all the summer world was bright and fresh , and brimming with life . There was a song in every heart ; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips . . . Cardiff Hill , beyond the village and above it , was green with vegetation , and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land , dreamy , reposeful and inviting . <P> Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush . . . <P>  --  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer <P> CHILDHOOD : THE DELECTABLE LAND . Like Cardiff Hill , it lies just far enough away from the adult mind to be dreamy , to shimmer with a sentimental abstraction  --  if one does not recall it too precisely . Childhood , where everyone begins , has the power of myth . Big people are gods , and the world is magic  --  or terrifying . <P> Like myths of Eden , the stories of Huck and Tom endure in the American imagination . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Huckleberry Finn , Huck 's journey in the Delectable Land is also a drama of alcoholism , child abuse , young runaways , social breakdown , violence , hypocrisy , racism and a child 's struggle to understand right and wrong in a society that has lost its bearings . Huckleberry Finn is still the best book about American childhood , as contemporary as a milk carton bearing the photograph of a missing child . <P> Only sentimentalists have ever considered childhood to be a kingdom of untroubled innocence . Today there is more trouble for children and less time for innocence than in recent generations . The problem is not so much that children have changed . The world has changed . Writes Dr. Robert Coles , a psychiatrist and author who has studied the lives of the young for more than 30 years : " Children have always been , and still are , a mirror to us  --  ourselves writ small . " Ourselves have changed . <P> It is both the best and the worst of times for children . Their world contains powers and perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer life expectancies ; the entire planet accessible through television , satellites , air travel . But so much knowledge and choice can be chaotic and dangerous . School curriculums have been adapted to teach about new topics : AIDS , ADOLESCENT SUICIDE , DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE , INCEST . Trust is the child 's natural inclination , but the world has become untrustworthy . The hazards of the adult world , its sometimes fatal temptations , descend upon children so early that the ideal of childhood is demolished . <P> Crack , for example , is far more addictive and deadly than marijuana , the drug of a different generation . Strange fragments of violence come flashing out of the television set and lodge in minds too young to understand them . In New York City a five-year-old and his friend argue about 1 ) whether there is a Santa Claus and 2 ) what Liberace died of . In New Orleans a boy in first grade shaves chalk and passes it around the classroom , pretending it is cocaine .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
