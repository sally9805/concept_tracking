Paul Newman ' s film version of " The Glass Menagerie " displays a powerful cast , but it may be more faithful to the text than the spirit of Tennessee Williams ' s play , said The Times ' s reviewer , Janet Maslin . This is a " serious and respectful adaptation , " Ms. Maslin wrote , " but never an incendiary one , perhaps because the odds against its capturing the play ' s real genius are simply too great . In any case , this ' Glass Menagerie ' catches more of the drama ' s closeness and narrowness than its fire. " // Joanne Woodward stars as Amanda Wingfield ; Karen Allen as her fragile daughter , Laura ; John Malkovich as Laura ' s brother , Tom , and James Naughton as the " gentleman caller " intended for the shy Laura. // " Miss Woodward makes a fluttery , garrulous Amanda , bustling about the apartment setting that becomes , in Tony Walton ' s design , especially cluttered and dim , " Ms. Maslin said. // And although Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a lovely , delicate presence here , with the same kind of dark-eyed shyness Jane Wyman once brought to the role. " // As Tom , Mr. Malkovich " has the awkward task of switching from the pained , poetic style of the opening narration to a more lightly conversational tone , but he manages this gently and well. " // And Mr. Naughton ' s gentleman caller , Ms. Maslin said , is " a fine mixture of hucksterism and real feeling . " <> <> <> <> Riders of the Storm <> Starring Dennis Hopper , Michael J.

Mr. Hopper wears funny hats , chews on a cigar and barks commands . Mr. Pollard , as the engineering genius aboard the plane , has little to do except smile subversively .

" But its style is hopelessly ordinary without being particularly frank , and the level of insight displayed is hardly more engaging. " // Not until the title character appears , she said , " is it possible to glimpse what ' Patti Rocks ' has been after . Though her character is hackneyed and improbable , Miss Landry projects the subtlety and the furious energy so lacking in the story ' s earlier sections .

Rated R. // The director William Richert based this coming-of-age movie about a few hours in the life of a recent high-school graduate on a novel he wrote in 1963 , at the age of 19. // And while " A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon " can ' t match his film " Winter Kills " for " inspired craziness , " Janet Maslin said in The Times , " it does punctuate a seemingly ordinary story with welcome bursts of lunacy that are almost its saving grace . Even if Mr. Richert never overcomes the fundamental triteness of this material , he does what he can to keep it lively and off balance at every turn.

But " neither fortuitous timing nor elevating camerawork helps to invest such a miasma with meaning , and the results are pretentious , unsightly and vague. " // The movie ' s " characters are fundamentally incomprehensible , the timing way off ( the denouement arrives half an hour too early ) , and the whole story ultimately just a 10-year detour in the life of Joan , who was on her way to Malibu when she first met Paul in the desert near Tucson , Ariz .
