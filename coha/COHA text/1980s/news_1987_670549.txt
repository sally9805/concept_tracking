But the concession - to have the United Nations propose a mutual withdrawal of obsolete American missiles from Turkey in exchange for a Soviet pullout of its missiles from Cuba - did not have to be made . To the surprise of President Kennedy , Nikita S. Khrushchev , the Soviet leader , agreed to an American ultimatum that the missiles be withdrawn from Cuba without an explicit link to the American Jupiter missiles in Turkey. // An article by J. Anthony Lukas , to be published in The New York Times Magazine Sunday , reports that Mr. Rusk disclosed the episode last March in a letter read at a conference of experts on the crisis at Hawk ' s Cay , Fla . <> <> Statement to Be Made by U Thant // As reported in the magazine and discussed in an interview yesterday by Mr. Rusk , the letter said that during the crisis President Kennedy " instructed me to telephone the late Andrew Cordier , " a former United Nations official " then at Columbia University , and dictate to him a statement which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations , proposing the removal of both the Jupiters and the missiles in Cuba. " // Mr. Rusk wrote that " Mr. Cordier was to put that statement in the hands of U Thant only after a further signal from us. " // " That step was never taken and the statement I furnished to Mr. Cordier has never seen the light of day , " Mr. Rusk said . " So far as I know , President Kennedy , Andrew Cordier and I were the only ones who knew of this particular step . " <> <> Russians Dismantled Missiles // The step became unnecessary because on Oct. 28 , 1962 , the Russians began dismantling the missiles , thereby ending the crisis , the day after the statement was dictated. // Reached yesterday at his home in Athens , Ga. , where he is convalescing after a stroke , Mr. Rusk , who was Secretary of State at the time of the crisis , said he had chosen to disclose the statement because " it seemed to me that it was an appropriate time to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the organizer of the conference , James G. Blight , the executive director of the Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University. // In his letter Mr. Rusk said " there is a postscript " to the missile crisis " which only I can furnish. " // " It was clear to me that President Kennedy would not let the Jupiters in Turkey become an obstacle to the removal of the missile sites in Cuba because the Jupiters were coming out in any event , " he said . <> <> Robert Kennedy ' s ' Ultimatum ' // On Oct. 27 , 1962 , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , the President ' s brother , offered a three-part " ultimatum " to the Russians - that the forces in Cuba be withdrawn , that the United States in return would not invade Cuba , and that the United States would pull the Jupiters out of Turkey according to previous plans and not as part of any deal with the Russians. // In his letter this year , Mr. Rusk said that shortly after Robert Kennedy brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobrynin , President Kennedy conferred with Mr. Rusk on what to do if the Russians rejected the ambiguously phrased section on withdrawal of the Jupiters . Moscow had wanted an explicit trade , but Washington was refusing to make it explicit. // Mr. Rusk contended in the interview that the Cordier ploy " was not all that much of a big deal ; it was simply an option that would have been available to President Kennedy had he wanted to use it. " // But Mr. Blight , who was reached yesterday at his office in Cambridge , Mass. , ascribed greater significance to the Cordier ploy , as some are calling it at the center . He said it was " evidence that President Kennedy , in the real dark hours of the crisis - there on the last weekend - was convinced that , first of all , war was likely if things continued on their present course , and , secondly , that he did not want war . " <> <> ' A Public Trade ' // Mr. Blight , a psychologist by training , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it seem that President Kennedy , at the time , was willing to have , as Mr. Blight put it , " a public trade of American missiles in Turkey for the Soviet missiles in Cuba. " // Mr. Blight said a transcription of tape recordings of meetings of Kennedy Administration members of that time showed that " most of the Kennedy advisers believed that a public trade of missiles would , if not destroy NATO , create an enormous complication " for the alliance . The reasoning , he said , was that such an exchange " would have been perceived as selling out a NATO ally " - Turkey - " to solve a local problem in the Caribbean that should have been solved in some other way without bringing NATO into the picture at all . " The transcript of the recordings is to be published in the December issue of the center ' s quarterly journal , International Security. // Mr. Blight observed that " the letter that Rusk wrote to me in lieu of coming to the conference , because he was ill , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that the President may have been willing to do just that , to trade the missiles publicly and risk whatever the consequences would be for the NATO alliance. " // Mr. Blight said it was certain that the Cordier initiative had not been made public elsewhere before the conference and was " known only to President Kennedy , Secretary Rusk and to Andrew Cordier at the time . And Rusk is the only survivor of that trio - and he told us that he had never shared that information with anybody . " <> <> Value of Missiles Was Limited // Dr. Cordier was a Midwesterner who , after 16 years as a high-ranking official and troubleshooter at the United Nations , left in 1962 and became dean of Columbia ' s School of International Affairs . He went on to become acting president of the university in 1968 and 1969 before becoming president in 1969 and 1970 . He died in 1975. // In a part of Mr. Rusk ' s letter to Mr. Blight that was not read at the conference but which was made available to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the Jupiter missiles was limited. // " When President Kennedy took office , " Mr. Rusk wrote , " he had in front of him a very critical report from the Joint Atomic Committee of Congress about the Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Italy . The committee considered these missiles to be both obsolete and vulnerable. " // " I remember that we joked about which way the missiles would fly if they were fired , " Mr. Rusk went on , adding , " I also remember being told that a tourist driving an automobile along a public highway with a . 22 calibre rifle could knock holes in the skins of these missiles. " // The Cuban missile crisis was one of the tensest confrontations between the Soviet Union and the United States . It aroused widespread concern in this country that the two superpowers might have a nuclear exchange . The crisis came after the abortive United States-backed invasion of Cuba by anti-Castro Cuban exiles in April 1961 , and the erection of the Berlin Wall by the Soviet Union in East Germany in August 1961 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West and increase tensions in West Berlin. // In the following year , the Russians resolved , in secret , to deploy missiles in Cuba , for reasons which are still not certain - to bolster the new Soviet ally , or to put pressure on Washington to agree to a neutralized West Berlin . President Kennedy learned through aerial reconnaissance of the secret buuilding of missile-launching installations on Cuba , and on Oct. 22 he criticized the Soviet initiative in public . He ordered the Navy to impose a naval quarantine of Cuba , and threatened military retaliation against the Soviet Union if any missile were fired from Cuba. // It was on Oct. 28 , the day after the preparations for the Cordier ploy , that Mr. Khrushchev agreed to pull the missiles out and scrap the launching installations . With the crisis evaporated , the United States quarantine ceased late in November and the missiles were soon gone from the island . With the crisis resolved , relations between Washington and Moscow improved . The two powers signed the first test ban treaty in 1963. //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
