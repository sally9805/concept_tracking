The message is not so much an apology as a warning , and never has it been more appropriate . No Mexican play in decades has created as much controversy or inspired so strong a reaction from the country ' s political and intellectual elite . Billed simply as " a thriller in two acts " and taking as its point of departure what one character calls " a Mexican Watergate , " Vicente Lenero ' s drama dissects the relationship between press and government here , suggesting that both are morasses of corruption , treachery and servility. // " Nadie Sabe Nada " - " Nobody Knows Anything " - revolves around a reporter , Pepe Gutierrez , whose troubles begin when a source offers him secret documents " straight from the president ' s desk " pertaining to a scandal whose exact nature the audience never learns . Soon undercover agents of both the Ministry of the Interior and the federal prosecutor ' s office are hot on his trail , trying by any means to recover the papers even as they seek to eliminate each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a series of threats , bribes and mayhem in which three men are murdered and a woman is raped , the papers return to government hands . As the play ends , the chief prosecutor is on the phone , preening at praise from a superior at the president ' s office , perhaps even the president himself . " That ' s what we are here for , sir " are her final words. // For many in the audience , the play offers a first intimate glimpse of the way Mexican journalism operates , and the sight is not a pretty one . In one scene , reporters are sitting at a table in a cantina , drinking beer and playing dominoes as they casually compare the payoffs they regularly receive from federal ministries , state governments and labor unions . " Those of us who cover the beat permanently get a bit more , but everybody got at least $200 , in addition to a free bar tab and a chance to party , " one of the reporters says of a recent assignment . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s for sure. " // According to Mr. Lenero , " This play is not the denunciation of a particular person but simply the presentation of a particular type of behavior and set of relationships . " The playwright , who is also a novelist and managing editor of the independent newsmagazine Proceso , continued : " Many Mexican reporters behave this way , I believe . The subject has a certain immediacy to anyone who lives and works in the journalistic medium , and you have a choice of treating it as drama , tragedy or farce. " // The director , Luis de Tavira , who runs the Center for Theatrical Experimentation and commissioned the work , said he originally asked Mr. Lenero to write a play in the tradition of a Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler detective story . " But we have no Sam Spades or Philip Marlowes in Mexico , so we necessarily had to turn to that place where police , press and politics come together , " he explained . " Secrecy is a form of government here , and there are mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important to say it is the government that pays off journalists and that there are journalists who make a living from this. " // Though ostensibly a work of fiction , " Nobody Knows Anything " has had an extraordinary impact on the public that can be attributed in part to its eerie foreshadowing of real events . The play was in its final rehearsals this spring when Hector Felix Miranda , a gadfly editor and columnist , was murdered in Tijuana . The week the play opened , government investigators uncovered a blood feud in which officers from rival police forces from Mexico City and neighboring Mexico State were killing each other. // Then , the weekend before the July 6 presidential election , a top campaign aide to the left-wing candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was shot to death in his car ; the case remains unsolved , and the papers the murdered man was carrying have yet to be recovered. // In addition , no sooner was the play being performed than politically acute theatergoers began commenting on certain similarities between the pusillanimous editor of Pepe ' s unnamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexico City daily El Dia but also is a senator from Colima , the home state of President Miguel de la Madrid . It was equally obvious that the vain and publicity-hungry district attorney who recovers the purloined papers bears a marked resemblance to Victoria Adato , formerly the chief prosecutor of Mexico City and a friend of Mr. de la Madrid since their teen-age years. // It surprised few , then , that after a handful of previews in late May , " Nobody Knows Anything " was suddenly withdrawn from performance . A statement issued by the National Institute of Fine Arts , or I.N.B.A. , said the action was taken because " the quality of the work , or at least the level of its mise en scene , leaves much to be desired " and because " allusions of dubious taste are made to institutions and persons who deserve respect and consideration . " In no way , it continued , " can I.N.B.A. vouch for this work through its sponsorship. " // Many here regarded the criticism of the staging as simply a pretext , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the strongest and most innovative aspects of the play . The stage contains a dozen hyperrealist sets , ranging from the newsroom of the newspaper and the apartment of Pepe ' s " Deep Throat " to a sleazy cabaret and the locker and shower rooms of the rundown gymnasium where the confidential source is stabbed to death by government agents. // Throughout the play , action occurs simultaneously on various sets , with dialogue bouncing from one side of the stage to another . " My construction of what happened , " Mr. Lenero said , " is that someone at a very high level became upset , and I.N.B.A. had to accept the prohibition. " // Fearing that the government would make good on implied threats to dismount the stage set , the cast of 25 and various stagehands occupied the Teatro El Galeon , where they camped out for a week and vowed to resist , if necessary . " It ' s a big set , so there were plenty of rooms where people could sleep , " Mr. de Tavira said wryly . Cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything , " in addition to being an affront to freedom of expression , would lead to the dissolution of their critically acclaimed company , which is funded by the Mexican government. // In the end , author and director agreed to make five changes in the play , " none of which affect the integrity of the work , " Mr. Lenero said , and were permitted to resume public performances in June. // The newspaper editor became a man named , somewhat ironically , Vicente ( the playwright ' s own first name ) , the prosecutor no longer wears a scarf around her neck , which was Ms. Adato ' s trademark , and a reference to her as an " old whore " was removed . In addition , a brief excerpt from a campaign speech by President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari was eliminated , as was a moment in which a character dozing in front of a television set awakens startled when the Mexican national anthem is played. // Even so , " Nobody Knows Anything " continues to shock , anger and sadden audiences here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisons and defiles everyone , from those at the center of power to the humble flower girl who moonlights as a prostitute . A run through December now appears assured , long lines form early outside the theater each night and every performance plays to a full house . After all , nobody knows when fiction and reality may collide again. //
