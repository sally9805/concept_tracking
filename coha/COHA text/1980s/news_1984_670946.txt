First there was the tale of Twinkles , the ailing zoo elephant , who was sold to a traveling circus where she later died. // There were the two Kodiak bears who were killed at a roadside menagerie in North Carolina , apparently forgotten by the city-run zoo that had lent them out. // And then came the disclosure that a city worker was making rabbit stew and other dishes out of the surplus small animals he had bought from the zoo ' s children ' s exhibit. // Zoo professionals and animal welfare agencies across the country condemned the 35-acre facility as one of the worst in the nation. // Now , two months later , a group of civic leaders , business executives and politicans say they hope to complete work next month on a plan to manage and finance a rebuilding of the dilapidated , 95-year-old zoo . <> <> A Plan to Replace Cages // // Among other things , they are studying a recommendation that calls for $12 million raised through the sale by the city and county of general revenue bonds coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages and existing exhibits with open areas where the animals would roam freely as they do in the wild. // In the meantime the zoo ' s interim director has hired additional staff members , including the zoo ' s first full- time veterinarian , and revised procedures to make sure , he said , that the kind of problems that occurred earlier this year would not happen again. // " When I took over as interim director in June , I laid down some edicts , " said the interim director , Terry Maple , a primatologist and professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is the top candidate for post of permanent zoo director . " One was that there will be no more animals loaned to roadside zoos . Another was that there will be no more animals consumed . " <> <> Attendance is Down // // There are some indications that the controversy over the zoo has cost it public support . Attendance this summer is barely half what it was a year ago . Sixty percent of the people who responded to a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , said the city would be better off if the zoo was closed. // " While we are impressed so far with Dr. Maple , we are adopting a wait-and- see attitude about whether the zoo can really turn itself around , " said Jeanne Roush , the director of the captive wildlife program of the Humane Society of the United States and one of the zoo ' s sharpest critics . " Frankly , given the fact the city administration did not deal very honestly with the problems when they surfaced last June , I have to remain cautious and skeptical. " // But civic and governmental leaders said they were optimistic. // " The incidents earlier this year were tragic , but the very fact they occured has made me certain the revitalization will succeed , " said Robert Petty , a banker and the president of the Atlanta Zoological Society . " In the end , it doesn ' t matter to me whether the changes that come about are the result of altruism or just plain embarrassment . The main thing is that there is change. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some changes have been made . In addition to the zoo ' s annual budget of $875 , 000 , the city has pumped $500 , 000 into the zoo this year for painting , cleaning and landscaping . In June , an anonymous donor gave the zoo $50 , 000 as the first installment of a gift toward establishing a permanent exhibit of 30 apes donated to the zoo by the Yerkes Primate Research Center at Atlanta ' s Emory University. // " It will include three separate breeding families of apes , in a natural habitat setting , " said Professor Maple . " There won ' t be anything else like it in the world. " // The zoo has been barraged by offers of help and financial aid from civic groups and private donors . In the wake of Twinkles ' s death , Professor Maple said donors even offered him three elephants. // Carolyn Boyd Hatcher , commissioner of the city ' s Department of Parks , Recreation and Cultural Affairs , which administers the zoo , said a new political consensus has emerged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the controversy that surfaced in June . <> <> Economic Benefits Seen // // " People now see the zoo as having economic benefits , not only because the construction there will put people to work but because it will create revenue and and become a major tourist attraction , " said Mrs. Hatcher . More critically , she said the emerging political consensus on behalf of zoo reform was biracial. // " Part of the problem in the past is that the group that was the strongest advocate of the zoo was seen as a bunch of mostly white , wealthy do-gooders , " Mrs. Hatcher said . She added that there had been suspicion between black city government officials and the mostly white zoological society. // Race also complicated the zoo ' s management situation . The zoo ' s former veterinarian , Dr. Emmett J. Ashley , is black , and had close ties to the city ' s black political leaders . Other zoo staff members , especially those most critical of Dr. Ashley , are white , a situation city officials , including Mrs. Hatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race issue. // Last March , a report by the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums was sharply critical of Dr. Ashley . The association suspended the Atlanta zoo from its membership , and some other zoos , including the Bronx Zoo of New York , asked for the return of animals on loan to Atlanta. // Last June , Dr. Ashley , who has denied any wrongdoing , was given an indefinite suspension without pay . While his status remains uncertain , he is not expected to return to work at the zoo. // In the meantime , Professor Maple has emerged as the most unabashed cheerleader for reform at a zoo he himself once called a " national disgrace . " " I want to liberate the animals , " he said on a recent tour , complaining of cramped , substandard cages and exhibt areas where there is little or no shade . " I want to build a great zoo in Atlanta. " // Among the fund-raising programs he has suggested would be a campaign to build a new outdoor facility to house Willie B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 . " We going to ask for donations to " Help Free Willie B. , ' " said Professor Maples. // //
