Misconduct , mismanagement lead to a near record failure rate <P> A financial thunderbolt struck the tiny farm community of Danvers ( pop . 920 ) in west-central Illinois one Friday this month . The First National Bank of Danvers , the only bank in town , with 2,560 accounts and about $11 million in deposits , was declared insolvent by federal authorities and shut down until new owners could reopen it under another name . That same day 2,000 miles away , the Oregon Mutual Savings Bank in Portland also closed its doors before being taken over by an Idaho holding company . The bank had seen its net worth fall nearly 20% in just six months . Said President Jack Goetze : " Without a capital infusion , our net worth would have been seriously impaired in another ten months . " <P> Bank failures used to come in isolated outbreaks . During the 1960s and ' 70s , they averaged fewer than ten a year . But despite the stronger-than-expected economic recovery , they are now occurring at a worrisome rate . Across the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By year 's end , the number of failures , now 35 , should easily beat the post-Depression record of 43 set in 1940 . ( Runner-up : 1982 with 42 failures . ) <P> In Texas , anxious depositors withdrew $447 million during the first half of the year from the First National Bank of Midland ( assets : $1.5 billion ) , whose loans to oil and gas producers turned sour . Earlier this month , the bank reported a second-quarter loss of $109.3 million . Many banks are now teetering on the brink of collapse . At the end of July , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation listed 540 " problem " banks , ranging from small state-chartered ones with too many weak agricultural loans to nationally chartered banks with bad business loans . Among the 540 , the FDIC secretly lists dozens as likely to fail unless they are soon merged with healthier financial institutions . Says John Downey , chief national bank examiner for the Comptroller of the Currency : " The number is the highest I 've ever seen it . " <P> No longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked doors , or widows and orphans being stripped of their life savings . Closings have become so routine that agencies like the FDIC perform them with robot-like precision . Typically , authorities move in after business hours on Friday and freeze accounts . By the following Monday , they have either paid off the depositors or allowed another bank to assume control . But such transitions are not without cost . The FDIC spent $870 million last year , mostly to compensate private financial institutions for taking over bad loans . Moreover , bank shareholders can see their investments vanish when the financial institution goes under . <P> Part of the blame for the rising number of failures belongs to the recession and its complement of bankruptcies and defaulted loans . But increasingly , the problems are due to poor bank management . Says an FDIC attorney : " We find examples of actionable negligence on the part of bank officers and directors in virtually every case of a closed bank . "                  @ @ @
