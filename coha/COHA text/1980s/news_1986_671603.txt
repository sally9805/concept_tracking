This year , though , as the 112th Derby next Saturday approaches , the institution of the Triple Crown looks shakier than ever . It has come under attack on two fronts : from new , richer races with bonus schemes that can lure horses away from the Preakness and the Belmont , and from the Breeders ' Cup , a program of seven rich championship races at year ' s end , which has threatened to replace the Triple Crown as racing ' s premier event. // Both of these threats are likely to grow stronger in the near future. // Last year , a bonus plan offered by Garden State Park in Cherry Hill , N.J. , succeeded in luring the Derby winner , Spend a Buck , away from the Preakness and Belmont to run in the Jersey Derby . The colt ' s owners passed up a chance at the crown but won $2. 6 million when their colt took the New Jersey race . Garden State ' s success in generating publicity and recognition makes it likely that other tracks will try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , racing is expected to have spread to such potentially lucrative markets as Atlanta , Dallas and Houston , where fledgling tracks might well put up purses of several million dollars to lure a Derby winner. // The Breeders ' Cup represents a subtler challenge . The seven Cup races , run on one day in November , are beginning to carry as much cachet as the spring classics . Triple Crown boosters fear that the owners and trainers of top 3-year-olds who are slightly behind schedule for the crown races may decide to back off and wait for the Cup races . There is some evidence to suggest that this may have happened this year. // The Triple Crown is fighting back . After Spend a Buck ' s defection from the series last year , the three host tracks - Churchill Downs in Louisville , Ky . , Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore and Belmont Park on Long Island - joined togther and incorporated the series as Triple Crown Productions Inc. , to promote and enrich it. // " Twenty years ago , nobody thought you ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Triple Crown , " says Chick Lang , the general manager of Pimlico . " It was the bedrock . Now , nothing ' s sacred. " // The Triple Crown is younger than the sum of its parts. // The first Kentucky Derby was run in 1875 , the first Preakness in 1873 and the first Belmont in 1867 , but no horse in the 19th century ran in all three races . The weak link was the Derby , then a minor local race that did not attract horses from the powerful Eastern stables that dominated the sport. // The Derby began to grow in the first two decades of this century under the aggressive promotion of Matt Winn , a Louisville businessman who courted the Eastern stables and sportswriters . In 1919 , an Eastern colt named Sir Barton came to the Derby looking for his first career victory . He won , and then went on to take the Preakness and Belmont . No one saw any particular significance to the three victories or gave the achievement a name. // The name came more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races in 1930 . Racing historians disagree about the coinage of the term , but credit Charles Hatton , a Daily Racing Form columnist , with popularizing it . It was in common usage by the time Gallant Fox ' s son Omaha became the third Triple Crown winner in 1935. // Five colts swept the series in the next 13 years : War Admiral in 1937 , Whirlaway in 1941 , Count Fleet in 1943 , Assault in 1946 and Citation in 1948 . With the crown being won roughly once every three years , each Derby winner seemed to have a good chance , and the racing fans thrived on the suspense. // The crown then became more elusive , and thus even more revered . In the 25 years after Citation , no horse was able to win it . When Secretariat did it again in 1973 , setting track records in the Derby and the Belmont along the way , he received more praise and publicity than any other horse in the history of the game. // Syndicated for $6. 08 million even before he swept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stallion market that would dominate the sport for the next decade . After Seattle Slew won the crown in 1977 , he was syndicated for $12 million , and a year later Affirmed won it and was syndicated for $22 million. // The situation Spend a Buck ran himself into last year was about a 1 , 000-to-1 shot : Garden State Park , reopening after seven years and looking to publicize its Jersey Derby , almost whimsically offered a $2 million bonus to any horse who could win its two Kentucky Derby prep races , the Cherry Hill Mile and Garden State Stakes , then the Kentucky Derby itself , and finally the Jersey Derby . After Spend a Buck won the Run for the Roses to complete the first three legs of that unlikely series , his owners decided to go for the money instead of the crown , Pimlico ' s black-eyed Susans and Belmont ' s carnations. . // Their decision prompted an uproar in the racing world and the formation of Triple Crown Productions , which has one goal : to insure the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hope is to raise the purses so high , and possibly offer various bonuses as well , that no other track could compete. // A small effort in this direction came this year with the institution of a common nomination form for the three races at a $600 fee . The result was a record 452 nominations , including 30 late ones at a $3 , 000 fee . This extra revenue is being split among the three tracks for winner ' s purses , and will raise them by about $30 , 000 . The managements of Churchill Downs and Belmont , have also kicked in another $100 , 000 apiece. // Still , the Preakness and Belmont purses are not enough to compete with the Jersey Derby ' s $600 , 000 winner ' s purse and the possibility of bonuses . This year , if Bordeaux Bob , who won the Cherry Hill , or Fobby Forbes , who won the Garden State , wins the Kentucky Derby , they will definitely skip the Preakness and run in the Jersey Derby for a $1 million bonus. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the executive director of Triple Crown Productions , says the key to increasing the Triple Crown purses so they can compete with the bonuses is commercial sponsorship . Nearly a dozen major North American races have picked up such sponsors in recent years and European tracks have sold all their major races - the Everready Epsom Derby , the Trusthouse Forte Arc de Triomphe and the General Accident 2 , 000 Guineas. // Does this mean that Americans can look forawrd to something like the Ken-L-Ration Kentucky Derby ? // " No , " Miss Korotkin says quickly . " It would still be called the 112th Kentucky Derby . But it could be the first leg of the Ken-L-Ration Triple Crown . We ' re sensitive to the sound of commercialization , but if you want a sponsor to spend $5 million , you have to use their name and give them their money ' s worth. " // Miss Korotkin also points out that this year , all three Triple Crown races will be televised by the same network , ABC , for the first time , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be promoted as such. // She rejects the notion that horses will be held out of the Triple Crown because of the Breeders ' Cup . This year , though , several top 3-year-olds who have been sidelined with injuries are not being rushed back to make the classics . Whether they would be fit enough to win them is questionable , but the trainers of Ogygian , Meadowlake , Storm Cat and Danzig Connection all mention the appeal of the Breeders ' Cup as a reason to proceed cautiously with their mending colts. // Another way to boost Triple Crown purses may be through off-track betting and simulcasting . Optimists foresee a day when virtually everyone in the country will be able to bet on and watch the Triple Crown races at home or at a local teletheater . The revenue from all this betting could significantly boost purses. // Triple Crown Productions is also considering a bonus scheme that would encourage participation in all three races . ( Rewarding a sweep would be redundant , since no winner of the Derby and Preakness has ever passed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishers , a bonus last year would have gone gone to Stephan ' s Odyssey , who finished second in the Derby and the Belmont. // The owners of Snow Chief , this year ' s Derby favorite , flirted with the idea of shooting for the Garden State bonus . They rejected it finally , but only because the timing of the races did not fit into the colt ' s training regimen. // " Of course you want to win the Triple Crown , " said Carl Grinstead , one of the owners , " but a million dollars is a lot of money . The best thing would be if the Triple Crown was so rich that nobody would have to make a choice between money and tradition. " // If the people who run and now own the name of the Triple Crown have their way , that is exactly what will happen. //
