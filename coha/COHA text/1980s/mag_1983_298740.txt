South Africa 's nightlife tycoon <P> When South African Hotelier Solo mon Kerzner speaks , he comes across more like a New Jersey dockhand than a powerful executive . He talks machine gun-style , from the corner of his mouth , with an accent sounding a bit like Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront . Yet the former college boxer 's pugnacious manner suits his controversial role in business . Kerzner , 48 , is southern Africa 's casino king . In a country so morally conservative that movie theaters are closed on Sundays and Playboy magazine is banned as the work of the devil , Kerzner has succeeded in assembling a $270 million hotel chain featuring gambling casinos , show business superstars , topless chorus lines and soft-core porn movies . <P> Kerzner put himself in the spotlight last month when he carried out a series of deals that parlayed his local hotel interests into virtual monopoly control of casino gambling in all of southern Africa . The transaction sparked indignation from religious groups when it became known that the South African government , through its Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kerzner 's new conglomerate of 13 hotel-casinos . The government 's role seemed to put Kerzner 's big deal in jeopardy , but last week Lady Luck came through for him once more . To avoid embarrassment , the government announced that it would sell all of its shares in Kerzner 's venture to private interests . <P> Because all forms of gambling except horse racing are prohibited in the white apartheid portion of South Africa , Kerzner 's casinos are springing up in the new black homeland states , which are nominally independent . His flagship is Sun City , a glittering $140 million oasis built in the homeland with the virtually unpronounceable name of Bophuthatswana . The state has a population of 1.4 million and an average annual income of less than $500 a year . The resort 's slot machines , roulette wheels and befeathered chorus girls attract as many as 50,000 visitors a day , mostly well-to-do whites who make the two-hour drive from Pretoria and Johannesburg . <P> Unlike most of South Africa , homelands like Bophuthatswana allow blacks and whites to mingle openly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apartheid that Kerzner has to pay platinum-plated premiums to get American entertainers like Linda Ronstadt and Kenny Rogers to brave possible censure for having performed at Sun City . Two years ago , Kerzner paid Frank Sinatra $2 million for nine shows over seven days , charging up to $85 per seat . Although such prices create a kind of economic apartheid at the resort since most blacks can not afford admission , Kerzner argues that Sun City is beneficial to the homeland because it provides jobs and tax revenue . Says he : " Sun City employs 3,000 people . That 's good economics for Bophuthatswana . " <P> Kerzner , whose third wife Anneline , 28 , is a former Miss World , got his start in the hospitality business when he persuaded his father to take out a lease on a dockside dive in the city of Durban . He turned the place into a swinging pub and used the profits to build the first hotel in a chain that became known as Southern Sun Hotel Group .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
