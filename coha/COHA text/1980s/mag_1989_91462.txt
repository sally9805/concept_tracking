Last Saturday afternoon everyone inside Florida 's sold-out Griffin Stadium was buzzing about junior running back Emmitt Smith . In a 27-21 homecoming victory over New Mexico , he gained 316 yards on 31 carries to become the Gators ' career rushing leader . But out in the parking lot after the game , a few old-timers at a tailgate party spoke instead of Honest Jon MacBeth , a fullback whose long-ago heroics seem  --  in light of Florida 's recent ills  --  no less remarkable than Smith's. // One night in late August of 1960 , MacBeth was approached by a couple of gamblers . He was offered nearly $5,000 to shave points in a game against Florida State and possibly another team . MacBeth first turned the gamblers down , and then he helped run them in by cooperating in a police sting operation that resulted in the gamblers ' conviction . " I guess Jon was about the last honest man in this town , " said one old Gator fan . // If Honest Jon , now a health and P.E . professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to wonder if his ethics meant anything . Gator basketball coaches stand accused of having paid players . Former players stand accused of having purchased drugs while playing for Florida . The starting quarterback and one of his backups were booted off the team last week for having bet on games , and the football coach resigned the week before that for having violated NCAA rules . All this means that the Gators may get the NCAA 's death penalty , which could shut down their football and/or basketball programs for one or two years . // The university 's Board of Regents would like to concentrate on finding a replacement for president Marshall Criser , who resigned last March  --  Robert Bryan is filling in on an interim basis  --  but it has been distracted by the sports morass . When Florida last searched for a president , in 1983 , it had 353 applicants from which to choose . This time the total is 67 . " I asked a friend to apply , and he said he was n't up to dealing with big-time athletics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three finalists , Malcolm Gillis , dean of Duke 's graduate school and a Florida alumnus , withdrew his name . He cited as a primary reason " fundamental and longstanding " problems in intercollegiate athletics . // Regents chairman Charles Edwards says he can envision Florida voluntarily shutting down its big-time sports programs . " I do n't think it 's a reasonable alternative today , " says Edwards . " If they do n't start obeying the rules , there will be no other choice . " // The Gators seem to have difficulty following NCAA rules . In 1984 football coach Charley Pell was fired for infractions that included improper recruiting activities and payments . The NCAA hit the football team with a three-year probation , and Criser promised an overhaul of the athletic department . Last year , however , a federal grand jury in Tallahassee , Fla. , investigating a cocaine ring , linked some Gator basketball players who no longer play for Florida , to drug use . Athletes appearing before the grand jury admitted to having bought coke . They also said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towe. // " Any time I asked for money , you know , I could get money from them  --  $200 , $50  --  whatever I asked for I could get , " said Vernon Maxwell , Florida 's leading career scorer and now a second-year guard with the San Antonio Spurs , testifying under a grant of immunity . Maxwell estimated that he received $1,000 each month for six-months during his sophomore and junior years from Sloan or Towe and that he used some of the money to buy cocaine . Sloan and Towe deny Maxwell 's allegation . // The drug investigation also led to the indictment earlier this year of four sports agents on charges of conspiracy , racketeering , mail fraud and wire fraud . The agents  --  accused of defrauding the university by making payments to Gator football and basketball players who still had some eligibility remaining  --  pleaded guilty to reduced charges . Under a plea bargain in U.S. District Court in Gainesville , the agents promised that they would never again represent athletes . // Florida 's 1989 football season kicked off under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had succeeded Pell after three games in ' 84 , lasted only five games . " The man violated his contract and committed major violations , " said Bryan . In his letter of resignation Hall admitted that , from ' 86 through ' 88 , he had paid two assistants a total of $22,000 in " unauthorized salary supplements ... from my own funds . " An NCAA rule stipulates that only a university can pay an athletic department employee . Hall also acknowledged that he had directed a graduate assistant to drive defensive back Jarvis Williams ( now with the Miami Dolphins ) to an unnamed city in January 1987 to face charges of nonpayment of child support . The ride constituted another NCAA violation. // Gator fans are sweating . Any school found guilty of serious rules violations twice within a five-year period automatically qualifies for the death penalty . Florida football was penalized for Pell 's violations in January 1985 , but if the NCAA , whose latest investigation of Gator athletics began in June , has not completed this probe by January ' 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five-year cutoff has passed . The basketball team also could get the death penalty if the NCAA finds major violations in Sloan 's program . // As if the NCAA investigation and grand jury testimony were n't damaging enough , on Oct. 15 starting quarterback Kyle Morris , who had thrown for 1,098 yards and nine TDs in six games , and Shane Matthews were suspended for the year for betting on college football games . Athletic director Bill Arnsparger received an anonymous letter alleging that at least two football players were betting with bookies . " It was n't real detailed , but it did have facts , " said Arnsparger . " The writer knew what he was talking about . I called the university lawyers . " // The accused players admitted to what they thought were minor indiscretions . They said they had bet small amounts  --  $25 to $100 per week  --  with an Athens , Ga. , bookmaking operation . They said they had bet on perhaps two games per week between late August and Oct. 7 , but had never bet on games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAA mandates suspension for athletes who bet on college sports , though an athlete can apply during the off-season to have his eligibility restored . Morris and Matthews had their scholarships revoked and moved out of the athletic dorm . They allowed the university to disclose why they had been kicked off the team . No reason was given for the suspension of two walk-ons , quarterback G.A . Mangus and receiver Brady Ackerman . Said a source at the university , " Two kids thought it would be better to have the real reason out there , so people would n't think it was drugs or something worse . Two exercised their rights of confidentiality . " // Thus began homecoming week , an annual blowout that purports to be the biggest , best , showiest , just-plain-fun-nest bacchanalia in all of collegeland . Professors go light on homework because the students need time to build the floats that will roll down University Avenue during Friday 's parade . Numerous alumni take vacations during the week and head for Gainesville . Student thespians rehearse the raunchy skits they 'll perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fills Griffin Stadium with 70,000 ticket holders . // This year homecoming week was very different . As the alumni pulled into town , they found banners hanging from the eaves of the Delta Upsilon fraternity house ridiculing the homecoming theme of " 65 Years of Excellence . " Two banners depicted mock front pages of the school newspaper , one with the headline PELL FORCED TO RESIGN , the other with HALL FORCED TO RESIGN . Delta Upsilon 's commentary was beneath the bold type : " After 65 years ... finally a tradition . " While the DU 's were hanging their banners , the brothers at Lambda Chi Alpha were preparing a float with a sign that read : GATOR FOOTBALL  --  YOU CAN BET ON IT . // Each morning The Gainesville Sun provided detailed accounts of the betting ring with which Morris and Matthews were involved . There was even an expos of a fantasy baseball league that included Arnsparger and other members of the athletic department . ( According to Arnsparger , the winner makes a few hundred bucks , and the payoffs go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate. ) // The local TV evening news covered the football team 's weekly media luncheon , which was tense , and the basketball team 's annual preseason media day , which was even tenser . At the latter gathering , Sloan again denied any wrongdoing . He said his team would weather the NCAA 's investigation . Then he let the reporters have it . // " This has been a zoo , " he said . " You people have been out of control .... If anything , any kind of evidence at all , had shown up that could verify that we had broken a rule , our asses would already be fired . Do n't you know that ? " The room was silenced. // Sloan denied requests for further interviews , but Arnsparger agreed to answer questions . He denied rumors that Sloan was about to be fired . " Nothing 's been proved against the basketball team , " he said . Arnsparger acknowledged , however , that Maxwell 's grand jury allegations had n't been disproved . He said the university was respecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the press was not . He said the university would address the allegations when the gag order was lifted . He noted that swift justice had been meted out to Hall and the gamblers and that the school , which must show that it is trying to put its house in order if it hopes to appease the NCAA , will address all allegations in due course . As of Sunday , Sloan and Towe were still running the basketball program . // But what about the St. Petersburg Times story claiming Arnsparger had ignored his own drug policy at the time  --  three positives , and a player is dismissed  --  by not suspending Maxwell after he had thrice tested positive ? " I 'm not going to answer a charge made by a newspaper , " said Arnsparger. // Had Maxwell tested positive ? " I 'll answer that at the proper time in the proper forum to the proper authorities , " Arnsparger said . // Morris , meanwhile , agreed to answer some questions . He said that " the betting really did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it just exploded , and we were shocked . It is like the Pete Rose thing . It 's just as big as far as college ball 's concerned . When it started , it never seemed it could get this big . " // Morris acknowledged that he had often passed the large sign in the Gator locker room warning players not to gamble . He said the message just never sank in . Despite his protestations that the gambling was innocent fun , Morris said that he and Matthews knew they should keep their wagering under wraps . He also revealed a considerable knowledge of gambling lingo. // " How the guy who wrote that anonymous letter knew about it , I do n't know , " said Morris . " We kept it between ourselves . It would make the games more interesting . We 'd parlay , or we 'd do three-game teasers and things like that , having to pick four-to-one odds and things like that . " // Morris said that he had never met the Georgia bookies , but that he had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bookies did n't know who we were , and we did n't know who they were , " he said . Morris also said he was under the impression that the bookies were college-aged and that they handled action from a lot of students . // That night Morris attended the Gator Growl . It proved to be a painful experience . Each time his image appeared in highlight films that were shown on two huge screens , the crowd booed . " That hurt , " Morris said on Saturday . " People started getting a little confidence in me and then I let them down .... " // One thing that could n't get lost in all the bad news was Smith 's performance against New Mexico . Nevertheless , Smith is frustrated because the Gators ' renegade reputation may jeopardize his chances of winning the Heisman Trophy . " That 's a possibility , " he said , " but I think the voters should judge me , not my school . I have n't stepped out of line . Do n't penalize me because some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems ungracious in distancing himself from Florida 's troubles , forgive him . The ugliness has worn down even the most die-hard Gators . " This is a good school , " said alumnus Mac Steen as he stood outside the stadium after the game . " It 's got solid academics . It 's not just a jock factory . We 're all ashamed of this situation . I 'll tell you , I 'd rather have a program like Duke 's or Vandy 's , with integrity top to bottom , than this one . " // Steen was cocaptain of the 1969 football team . That was back in the days when everyone still remembered Honest Jon MacBeth .
