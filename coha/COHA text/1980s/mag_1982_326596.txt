" To the Greatest Man in the World , " the letter said , and the postal authorities knew just where to deliver it . To the same place where they delivered letters addressed to " God 's Gift to the U.S.A. " and " My Friend , Washington , D.C. " To the desk of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the White House . This was not pure sycophancy in the Post Office . The mailmen also knew where to deliver letters addressed to " Benedict Arnold 2nd " and " Chief Shooter at the Moon , White Father of the Pretty Bubbles . " <P> And Roosevelt , the most loved and hated of Presidents , saved the envelopes . They became part of his famous stamp collection , which eventually numbered 1.25 million different items . With the instinctive frugality of the rich , Roosevelt also collected first editions , coins , ship models , naval prints , Christmas cards , portraits of Presidents , Dutch tiles and campaign buttons . But stamps were special . He not only approved every new issue that appeared during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen , including one for Mother 's Day and one in honor of Susan B. Anthony . <P> It was his mother , the formidable Sara Delano Roosevelt , who had inculcated in him her own love of collecting and given him his first stamps . She was 26 when she married a widower twice her age , James Roosevelt , 52 , a member of the landed gentry of the Hudson Valley and ex-President Theodore Roosevelt 's fourth cousin once removed . Franklin was her only child , and she kept him in dresses and long curls until he was five . He was 14 before he first went to school , to Groton and then Harvard . He maintained what was known as " a gentleman 's C average " and yearned to be popular . Though he became editor of the Crimson , he could not make the freshman football team , and he was crushed at failing to get into Harvard 's fanciest club , the Porcellian . Girls who encountered him at debutante dances considered him a lightweight and nicknamed him Feather Duster . His newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . <P> Roosevelt did better at Columbia Law School , then sampled life at the prestigious Wall Street firm of Carter , Ledyard and Milburn . When he married his high-minded cousin Eleanor in 1905 , his mother bought and furnished their house . Roosevelt restlessly entered local politics , won a seat in the state senate , made himself a name as a " reformer " by blocking a Tammany Hall candidate for the U.S. Senate . Woodrow Wilson made him Assistant Secretary of the Navy , and Roosevelt went on to win the vice-presidential nomination in the doomed 1920 campaign of James C. Cox . The next year , after two long days of sailing and swimming at his summer home on Campobello Island in New Brunswick , he suffered a chill that was misdiagnosed , then the horrifying paralysis of polio . He was told that he would never walk again . <P> That a man seemingly so destined for limbo should be wheeled into the White House twelve years later was a great triumph of will . A number of his friends came to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 into the magnetic leader of 1932 . The long struggle endowed him with an extra measure of courage , of resilience and of sympathy for the afflicted .
