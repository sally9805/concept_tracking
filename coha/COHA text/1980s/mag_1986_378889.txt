Think for a minute of some of the things that have happened since June 17 , 1969 , when Oh ! Calcutta ! opened to almost universal boos from the critics : the first moon landing , Watergate , gas shortages and surpluses , the breakup of the Beatles and AT &T,; the demise of miniskirts , the birth and death of the yuppie , Rocky I , II , III and IV . A changing world , you might say , and shake your graying head . But calm down . There is some stability . In Manhattan and Sao Paulo , audiences are still paying to see Oh ! Calcutta ! and watch eight actors and actresses take it off  --  take it all off . <P> " The world 's longest-running erotic stage musical , " as it is now billed , has changed little since those Pleistocene days , and today 's critics would probably make the same judgments as their predecessors . " With all my heart , I recommend staying away from the slick and repulsive come-on called Oh ! Calcutta ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Voyeurs of the city unite , you have nothing to lose but your brains , " added Clive Barnes in the New York Times . " Far from being a sexual stimulant , Oh ! Calcutta ! is an anaphrodisiac , " declared TIME 's T.E . Kalem . <P> But audiences , who sometimes show an ornery independence from critics , apparently disagreed . In nearly 17 years , the show has been performed more than 15,000 times in 15 countries , and it has titillated , shocked and outraged roughly 86 million people . " There is always some reaction to Oh ! Calcutta ! , " says Norman Kean , its producer and promoter . " Its message is theatricality  --  outrageous theatricality  --  which goes beyond the twilight zone into a territory that had never been explored onstage before . " <P> That territory was , of course , sex . Except for Hair ( 1967 ) , which caused gasps with its blink-of-the-eye moment of frontal nudity , naked bodies  --  really naked bodies  --  had never before been seen on a respectable stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when after a striptease with bathrobes , the entire cast threw off the veil of terry cloth and lined up across the stage , protected by nothing but smiles and goose pimples . " It was a staggeringly inventive piece of theater at the time , " says one of its twelve writers , Director Robert Benton ( Places in the Heart ) . " It was truly shocking and erotic . " ( Some of the other writers : John Lennon , Sam Shepard and Jules Feiffer . ) <P> Shocking and erotic were perhaps the two words dearest to the heart of Kenneth Tynan , the late English critic who conceived the idea for the show . " He said that we could write about anything in the world within the realm of sexuality , " says Benton 's Calcutta partner , David Newman . " The only other caveat he had was that our piece should have absolutely no redeeming social value . "
