NEW YORK  --  Few television series have ever started with as much ballyhoo as ABC-TV ' s " Call to Glory . " Plugged incessantly during the network ' s summer Olympics broadcasts , the drama about an Air Force family in the 1960s was praised enthusiastically by critics . The New York Times , for example , called it " as ambitious a television series as you are likely to see this season . " The hype worked . On Aug. 13 an estimated 45 million people , 44% of the TV audience at that time , tuned in to watch a two-hour premiere . Since then , however , " Call to Glory " has slid steadily in audience ratings and , although the fall prime-time television season is only in its third week , television and advertising agency executives are wondering how much longer " Call to Glory " will be on the air . Last week it ranked only 46th among the three networks ' 62 prime-time programs , attracting only 14% of the 84. 9 million U.S. homes with TV . Only 21% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred NBC ' s " TV ' s Bloopers and Practical Jokes " and 28% opted for CBS ' s " Scarecrow and Mrs. King . " " Call to Glory " is of particular interest to the TV industry because it doesn ' t rely on car chases , fight scenes or laugh tracks . Whatever its fate , the show is sure to become a case study in the continuing argument over the public appetite for so-called quality programming . More immediately , ABC needs a hit show . The network ' s fall schedule is off to a slow start , with three shows alreay yanked and NBC bumping it from second place in the three-network rankings . Reminiscent of the movie " The Right Stuff , " " Call to Glory " focuses on pilot Raynor Sarnac and his family ' s life on an Air Force base . Although ABC didn ' t include the show on the fall schedule when it was announced last May , the network was enthused enough about the three August broadcasts to substitute " Call to Glory " for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a space age motorcycle . Lewis H. Erlicht , president of American Broadcasting Cos. ' entertainment division , says it ' s a " safe assumption " that the show won ' t be canceled at the end of its initial run . " We ' re fully 100% behind it , " he said . Mr. Erlicht says the show ' s mediocre ratings are mostly due to its scheduling at 8 p. m . Eastern Time , preceding ABC ' s " Monday Night Football . " Several West Coast stations  --  which together reach 15% of the U.S.  --  have delayed " Call to Glory " until after the football game or to other days when it has little chance of getting good ratings . Furthermore , Mr. Erlicht said , many dramas take a long time to develop a steady audience . But others say that the sharp decline in " Call to Glory " viewers indicates they simply don ' t like the show . Recovering defecting viewers is one of the hardest chores in network TV .
