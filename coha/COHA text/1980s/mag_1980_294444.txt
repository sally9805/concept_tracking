Do homosexual males consciously seek danger ? <P> <P> In Manhattan they go by names like the Eagle 's Nest , the Spike , the Mine Shaft and the Anvil . In San Francisco they are called the Brig and the Ambush . They are all homosexual " leather " bars that cater to macho style and sadomasochistic taste . Along with some bathhouses , sex-gadget shops , magazines and private clubs , they make an increasingly visible subculture in the gay world . That leather fringe is now also visible on movie screens , as the backdrop for a film that has been denounced and picketed by homosexuals : William Friedkin 's Cruising , the story of a gay murderer in New York City . <P> Some patrons of the leather bars do not seem to mind Friedkin 's deadpan , nonjudgmental look at their world ; hundreds of them hired on as extras and played themselves onscreen . " The most positive benefit of Cruising , " says one extra , " would be for it to make gay men examine their promiscuity , the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the thrill of danger . The life we save may be our own . " <P> But other homosexuals remain touchy about the idea that gays consciously seek danger . They insist that only between 1% and 5% of homosexuals lean toward leather . Says Charles Brydon , co-director of the National Gay Task Force : " There just is not any evidence that gays are into S-M any more than straights are . " Though they admit that activities at the bars are remarkably exotic , gays insist that the possibility of bringing home a dangerous sex partner is remote . <P> Despite these disclaimers , homosexual homicides are frequent-and often gruesome ; dismembered corpses ( as in Cruising 's first killing ) and mutilated genitals are common . One explanation is that homosexual male sex is likely to be more aggressive than heterosexual sex simply because two men are involved . Sex researchers generally endorse Freud 's finding that " the sexuality of most men shows an admixture of aggression , of a desire to subdue . " Indeed the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively male perversions . <P> C.A. Tripp , a pro-gay psychologist and author of The Homosexual Matrix , thinks sadomasochistic practices are rare in heterosexuality and virtually nonexistent among lesbians , but relatively frequent in homosexuality because of " the additive effect of two males together . " In Tripp 's view , the average heterosexual who wants to play sadomasochistic games with his wife or girlfriend will be disappointed . Despite the male fantasy of a masked , booted , whip-wielding beauty , most women seldom want anything to do with SM . In male-to-male relationships , there is no such shortage of players , and leather bars make them easy to locate .
