DEXTER , Iowa - Ted Lenocker said yesterday he still supported President Jimmy Carter , even as he drove his pickup truck over the snow- covered corn fields that he would prefer not to plant next spring because of the sudden glut of grain in the country . " He ' s my type of person , " Lenocker said , even though the steel storage bins on his farm are filled with unsold corn and soybeans , and the market is plummeting since Carter ' s partial embargo against the Soviet Union . Yet , in spite of the embargo , and in spite of inflation that has driven the cost of a tractor up to $32,000 , Lenocker remains loyal to Carter . Out here on the prairie , where the wind slashes like a scimitar and the corn stalks protrude above the snow like little grave markers , a man ' s character is judged ahead of policy . " The first thing that comes to mind after the Nixon years is honesty , " Lenocker ' s wife , Geri , said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d be right out by now . " Fortunately for the President , there appear to be many Iowa farmers who feel as the Lenockers do and who represent a strain of support for Carter that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has been unable to shake . The Lenockers also represent the antithesis to the hordes of farmers who swarmed over Washington in their tractors last year to protest farm prices . Lenocker laughs when he recalls the " tractorcade " and says if the protesters spent more time managing their farms and less time demonstrating , they would be better off . Lenocker , 46 , feels he is successful because he has been a careful manager , a characteristic that Carter claims himself . Taking a visitor on a tour of his farm , Lenocker proudly displayed his new combine and tractors and the terraces he is constructing on the rolling land to prevent erosion . Lenocker defies the image of the farmer as a chronic complainer . " Our life is the greatest , " he says . " We ' ve never wanted for anything . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ' s a quiet life , but it ' s real rewarding . I love to farm , to watch livestock and plants grow . " The Lenockers live on a 1000-acre farm that has been in his family since 1868 , when his great-grandfather homesteaded the land . After Lenocker came home from the Korean war in 1954 , he and his wife worked together - she drove a tractor - to build their own operation by buying up adjoining acreage a little at a time . Across the way , Lenocker ' s parents still raise cattle on the " home place . " Last year was Lenocker ' s best year yet , with record yields of corn and soybeans . His grain is somewhat protected because he participated in a government program and is ensured of a loan price close to the market price before it began to fall . So he can afford to be more sanguine about the situation than other farmers here . Still , he would like to see the government use incentives to encourage farmers to take some of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpluses . He also would like to see more government support for conservation projects , but basically he agrees with Carter ' s farm policies . The Lenockers were first attracted to Carter because he was a farmer . They shook his hand at a rally at the Van Ryswyk Farm in Warren County in the fall of 1976 , and later spent $500 to go with a group of Iowans to the inauguration . " There were some people who thought when he became President that farmers would get everything , " Lenocker said . " But we didn ' t , and I think it ' s great . I don ' t want a handout . " Sometimes , he says , he and his wife talk about how good it is that Carter has kept the United States out of war . They have two daughters who are grown , but their 21-year-old son , Russ , is still at home , in charge of his own hog operation , and the thought of him going off to war is unbearable now " afterVietnam . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who met with Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland to discuss the ramifications of the embargo . The Carter campaign handled the meeting heavy- handedly and tried to get everyone who attended to sign a statement supporting Carter ' s action . " I took it home to read , but I ' m not going to sign it , " Lenocker said . But on Jan. 21 , three years and a day after they watched Carter take the oath of office , they plan to go to a friend ' s home where the precinct caucus of the Penn Township of Madison County will be held . There they will vote again for Jimmy Carter .
