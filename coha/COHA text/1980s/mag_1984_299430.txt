Growth is slowing , but falling interest rates encourage Wall Street <P> As the presidential election campaign enters its final lap , the economy is waving green and yellow flags , giving the White House cause for both concern and cheer . Government statistics released last week showed that growth is faltering and raised the specter that the U.S. might be headed for a new recession . But at the same time , interest rates dipped , lifting hopes that the recovery will gain new pep . On top of that , Britain cut the price of its North Sea oil by $1.35 per bbl. to $28.65 , and Nigeria followed with a $2 reduction to $28 . The breaks in oil prices and interest rates sparked an explosive rally on Wall Street . <P> Last week 's action started when Bankers Trust in New York City cut the prime rate that it charges for business loans from 12.75% to 12.25% . That sent the Dow Jones industrial average up twelve points for the day . On Tuesday most major banks dropped their prime , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched Bankers Trust 's half-point reduction , and the Dow slipped seven points in two days . <P> The bulls , it turned out , were only taking a breather . On Thursday the interest rate on federal funds , which are reserves that banks lend to one another overnight , fell as low as 9.5% from an average of 10.27% the day before . The financial markets took this drop as a sign that the Federal Reserve Board , which influences the funds rate through the amount of money it supplies the banking system , was easing monetary policy and would allow the cost of credit to fall . That plus the good news about oil caused bond prices to surge and the stock market to stampede . The Dow jumped nearly 20 points in half an hour , and its gain of 29.49 for the day was the biggest since a rise of 36 on Aug. 3 . On Friday trading was again heavy , and the Dow gained a half-point to finish at 1225.93 , up 35 for the week . <P> Wall Street 's exuberance was ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation , grew at an annual rate of 2.7% in the July-September period , down from the 7.1% pace of the year 's second quarter . The drop was slightly larger than expected , but many economists welcomed it in the belief that slower growth will keep inflation from speeding up . <P> A separate report from the Federal Reserve Board seemed to lend support for Walter Mondale 's contention that the U.S might be moving into a recession . It showed that industrial production declined .6% in September , falling for the first time since the last recession ended in November 1982 . Economist James Tobin of Yale University warned that the Federal Reserve should be concerned about a new downturn . Levy Economic Forecasts of Chappaqua , N.Y. , proclaimed that the recession was already here . <P> Government officials dismissed that gloomy talk . Said Federal Reserve Board Governor Henry Wallich : " I would n't take a month or two as an indication of where we 're going . " Assistant Treasury Secretary Manuel Johnson pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflation is moderate . Said he : " I expect the drop in production to be a temporary phenomenon .
