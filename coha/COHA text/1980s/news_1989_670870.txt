With the initial euphoria over the overthrow of General Noriega subsiding , residents of the capital devoted themselves to repairing the damage inflicted since American troops moved in on Dec. 20. // In some neighborhoods , the American troops , visibly more relaxed now that the military threat from General Noriega has virtually disappeared , helped residents in their cleanup . In the aisles of a large supermarket , soldiers in battle dress mingled with shoppers whom they had been assigned to protect from possible looters. // The new Government urged the Vatican today to expel General Noriega from his refuge at the Vatican Embassy here , but seemed to be avoiding any broad purge of the deposed military leader ' s supporters as it sought to extend its authority across the nation . The Vatican appeared to reject the argument that General Noriega was a common criminal who should be handed over to the United States for trial . A Vatican spokesman said the church saw political grounds in the asylum request . Page A16 . Outside the heavily guarded Vatican mission today , American troops mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers at the mission , in what radio stations here said was an attempt to harass General Noriega , who is known to detest rock music . One of the selections had the refrain , " I fought the law and the law won. " // Overnight , the American forces also shot out lights in the mission courtyard and burned grass in a neighboring lot. // At a news conference here this morning , President Guillermo Endara disputed that the general had a case for political asylum . " We believe General Noriega ' s crimes are not political , " Mr. Endara said at a news conference here this morning . " He is a common criminal of the worst kind . He has been accused , justly accused , of homicide , narcotics trafficking and other very horrendous crimes . We feel that the Papal Nuncio should in the very near future tell the criminal to leave the Nunciature. " // With most of General Noriega ' s former supporters , however , Mr. Endara continued to try to demonstrate forgiveness and magnanimity . He and his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have repeatedly promised that their Government of National Reconstruction and Reconciliation " will not be one of revenge or rancor , " and thus far have largely lived up to their promise , foreign officials said , if only out of necessity. // " There has been no massive purge so far , and I don ' t think there can be much of one , " a Latin American diplomat said . " This is a very small country and you can not run it just with those who remain completely untainted during 20 years of military dictatorship , because that is an awfully small group. " // Mr. Arias Calderon said the new Government would impose no limitations on political parties or newspapers , television or radio stations that supported General Noriega . The first newspaper to appear on the streets since the Dec. 20 American invasion , published this morning , was La Estrella . It is owned by the Duque family , which has extensive business and political ties to General Noriega and other military officials . <> <> Without ' Revenge or Rancor ' // Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the day , accompanied by good-natured exchanges with the 26 , 000 American soldiers now on duty here. // Along Avenida de los Martires , bordering the former Panama Canal Zone , young men and women painted over slogans demanding that " Yankee Go Home . " In Government housing projects , residents ripped down murals praising General Noriega. // As an incentive to get Panamanians to disarm , the United States military has been offering cash payments of up to $5 , 000 to those turning in bullets , grenades , pistols or automatic weapons . Announcing the program over the weekend , the military said the weapons had to be turned in " personally. " // As employees of the Government , the largest single source of jobs in this nation of 2. 2 million people , returned to work , they were being given assurances that there would be no reprisals made against them . As a condition of employment , the Noriega Government required many public servants to campaign , march and make donations on the general ' s behalf . <> <> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different approach is apparently being followed at lower levels of the military . The army , reorganized and renamed the Panama Public Force , has begun joint street patrols with American military units , but enlistments in the new force are being supervised by United States forces. // An American military intelligence official said the United States has " white , black and gray lists " containing the names of all members of the former Panamanian Defense Forces , and the identity card of each enlistee is checked to see on what list the name appears . Those on the blacklist are rejected for the force , but are not necessarily subject to prosecution. // It was unclear what fate awaits Cabinet officers , senior bureaucrats and labor leaders , many of whom have for years been accused of corruption and abuse by the Civil Crusade , whose leaders now form the nucleus of the new Government . Some former Cabinet ministers and pro-Noriega political and press figures have been taken into custody , but those arrests were ordered and carried out by American military authorities. // " So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a diplomat here said of the Endara Government . " We know that there are also many people within the Government who suffered personally at Noriega ' s hands and have scores to settle , but we don ' t know to what extent , if any , they are going to act on those impulses. " // One of those most publicly affected by such official violence , Mr. Ford , today described General Noriega as " a monster " who " beat , sexually harassed , tortured , exiled and killed . " It was pictures of Mr. Ford bathed in blood after being attacked with pipes by paramilitary forces loyal to General Noriega that aroused worldwide condemnation of the fraudulent presidential election here in May. // In a televised ceremony , Mr. Endara was formally named " constitutional President " after the Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced what it described as the real results of the May presidential election . Mr. Endara had been serving as " provisional president , " his authority deriving only from the fact that he had been installed by American troops. //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
