With a sense of noblesse oblige <P> In a startling analogy for a Republican , Attorney General-designate William French Smith , 63 , said last week that he would like to enjoy the same relationship with Ronald Reagan that Bobby Kennedy had with his brother John . Indeed , Smith , who has been Reagan 's attorney for 15 years and handles his business affairs , is almost as close as a brother to the President-elect . Claiming that the post-Watergate barriers erected between the President and the Attorney General are too restrictive , Smith wants an " easier " relationship . Says he : " J.F.K. and R.F.K. did n't have any crises , and I would hope that we would n't have any crises either . " <P> Does that mean the relationship revert to the cozy intimacy of former years , when the Attorney General sometimes too readily did the bidding of his boss ? Replies Smith : " Obviously , the Justice Department has to be independent , but it is part of the Executive Branch . Independence relates only to certain kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " People who know both Reagan and Smith are convinced that there is no cause for concern . Smith , one of three managing partners of Gibson , Dunn &; Crutcher , the second largest law firm in Los Angeles , has a solid reputation for being nobody 's man but his own . Los Angeles Attorney Seth Hufstedler , husband of Jimmy Carter 's Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler and a Democrat , feels that Smith 's views will certainly coincide with Reagan 's . But Hufstedler adds : " If you ask 100 lawyers in Los Angeles-make that 100 Democratic lawyers-I do n't believe that you will find one who would doubt Smith 's integrity . " <P> Born to a Boston Brahmin family , Smith learned to love California while wintering there as a boy . After graduating from U.C.L.A. and Harvard Law School ( ' 42 ) and a stint in the Navy , he decided to practice law in California . " I was n't going to be dictated to by my ancestors , " he says . " I came to Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . " He specialized in handling labor matters for corporate clients . Though a forceful negotiator , he won the respect of his adversaries . Says William Robertson , executive secretary of the Los Angeles County AFL-CIO : " He is really an objective and brilliant attorney . And , unlike a lot of labor lawyers , he is not a union buster . " Smith met Reagan in 1963 and became a kitchen cabinet adviser when his friend was elected Governor of California . <P>
