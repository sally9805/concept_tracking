" Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black , " decreed an entrepreneur named Henry Ford in 1909 . Nowadays shoppers browsing through a Ford showroom can choose models in everything from basic blue to racy red , but the founder 's favorite color remains popular with the company 's executives and shareholders . And with good reason : the profit-and- loss statements of Ford Motor Co. have lately come only in black . <P> Since 1986 , when the firm 's annual earnings topped those of General Motors for the first time in 62 years , Ford has kept its accelerator to the floor . In 1987 it posted an all-time industry high of $4.6 billion in profits , with sales of $71.6 billion . In 1988 Ford is already ahead of last year 's blistering pace . First-quarter earnings rose by 8.9% from the same period in 1987 , to $1.62 billion , topping the combined profits of GM ( $1.1 billion ) and Chrysler ( $184 million ) . Though 75% of Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well around the world . Revenues in Western Europe went up by 25% last year , to $15.7 billion , and even in Japan , Ford has scored persistent , if modest , sales increases . Looking at the figures , Auto Analyst Ann Knight of Paine Webber observes , " It would be hard to imagine them doing a better job . " <P> Almost everything Ford produces these days seems to fly out of showrooms . The smoothly styled Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable midsize sedans and wagons ( nearly 460,000 sold in the U.S. last year at prices starting at about $11,800 ) remain among the most popular cars on the road . The revamped Lincoln Continental ( $26,600 and up ) is in such demand that some customers must wait as long as five months for delivery . To appease impatient Continental buyers , Ford has started to send them $20 Cross pen-and-pencil sets along with an apologetic note ; one customer returned the gift , expressing a preference for the car . Hottest of all are Ford 's trucks : last year more than 550,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , putting them ahead of any other truck or car line in the U.S. <P> Under the innovative leadership of Chairman Donald Petersen , Ford is not simply coasting with its established models . Last month it introduced the Probe , a sporty two-door hatchback that may turn out to be nearly as successful as the Taurus . For a base price of $10,459 , the Probe offers front- wheel drive , a zippy but economical four-cylinder engine and the sleek , aerodynamic look of a European or Japanese import . That should not be surprising , because Ford designed and developed the Probe in a joint project with Mazda , the Japanese company in which Ford owns a 25% interest . Mazda 's plant in Flat Rock , Mich. , will be turning out 600 Probes a day by September . All the cars that can be produced through next October have already been sold to dealers . The product seems to be attracting young buyers who have previously leaned toward such imports as the Honda Prelude ( $13,640 ) or the Toyota Celica ( $11,548 ) . Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appeal that they plan to export 6,000 of the cars to Japan this year .
