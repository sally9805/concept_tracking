President of the debating team , 1300 on her boards , reads Noam Chomsky in her spare time , parents make $30,000 a year . Let 's see , $3,000 in financial aid sounds about right . You on board , Brown ? What about you , Barnard ? <P> Every spring , exchanges like this occur among the deans of 23 top private colleges . The idea is to avoid bidding wars for students accepted by more than one college , and to ensure that institutions are similarly interpreting financial information submitted by parents . But the Justice Department has decided to look into this practice , as well as into the fact that within groupings  --  the Ivy League schools and the Seven Sisters , for example  --  yearly tuitions tend to be similar . Presumably Justice wants to determine whether there is any violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act , which prohibits restraint of trade . <P> The cost of college is a hot topic because tuitions will increase up to 9% this fall . Total costs at Harvard currently run about $20,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity is not the result of price fixing , says Colby President William Cotter . The reason , he says , is " that a Ford costs about the same as a Chevy , " or in the case of Harvard and Yale , a BMW costs about the same as a Jaguar . Cotter admits that the market is not price sensitive . " A family decides on private vs. public , " he says . " But then they do n't pick the cheapest within the category . " <P> Colleges started sharing information in the 1950s . Now critics say the system is tantamount to price fixing . College officials disagree , but they are complying with the inquiry . " I 've done almost nothing but work on this request since July 31 , " says Amherst College treasurer James Scott . It will be worth the effort , he says , if critics " bitching and moaning about college costs " come to see that no one is getting rich teaching the country 's children .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
