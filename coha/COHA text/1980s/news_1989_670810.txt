As the backyard barbecuing season moves into full swing , people all over the country who may never otherwise cook a meal indoors are in the kitchen , blending secret ingredients with a kind of zeal otherwise reserved for patriots . " What ' s one man ' s barbecue sauce is another man ' s axle grease , " observed Sam Higgins of Arlington , Tex. , an old barbecue hand and author of the book " I ' m Glad I Ate When I Did ' Cause I ' m Not Hungry Now . " He said barbecue sauce gave him a new appreciation for American individualism. // When it comes to barbecue sauce , there is no limit to the variety . There are sweet sauces , mild sauces , thick sauces , thin sauces , sauces that burn the tongue . There are orange sauces , red sauces , clear sauces , brown sauces , sauces that are nothing more than vinegar . There are raw sauces , cooked sauces , ketchup-based sauces , mustard-based sauces and sauces made of beer . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some who say they do not use sauce at all. // " When you eat a steak do you want it swimming in bearnaise sauce ? " asked Robert Pearson , who owns Stick to Your Ribs , a popular Texas-style barbecue restaurant in Stratford , Conn . Mr. Pearson is adamant that sauce should be optional , and that , in any case , should not be applied to meat while cooking , but served on the side. // Barbecue sauce has become a statement of identity . In some areas of the country , stating your sauce is almost as good as giving out your ZIP code . Do you use vinegar ? Chances are you are from the coast of North Carolina . Brown sugar ? Good odds you are from Kansas . Tabasco ? Take bets the chef is from Texas . " There is nothing like going to the South for a pig sandwich , " said Carolyn Wells , a barbecue aficionado and cookbook writer who grew up in Nashville . She now lives in Kansas City , Mo. , where , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of chopped barbecued pork doused in a sticky tomato-based sauce often spiked with whisky. // " Here we use a vinegar-based sauce , " said Bobby Prescott , a high-voltage electrician and amateur barbecue chef , who grew up on a ketchup-based sauce in South Carolina but now , as a resident of the North Carolina coast , would never consider using anything else on barbecue except Tabasco and vinegar. // Entrepreneurial-minded sauce makers , inspired by Horatio Alger-like barbecue success stories , dream of making fortunes bringing their recipes to the masses. // Take Dr. Rich Davis . For 25 years , Dr. Davis practiced child psychiatry in a suburb of Kansas City , Mo . Like so many Americans , he worked the barbecue on weekends , giving his wife a respite from cooking . Then one day he had an idea while at a hamburger restaurant . It occurred to him that one of the most popular condiments nationwide was the combination of mustard and ketchup served at such fast-food establishments . He decided that what this country really needed was to be able to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bottle it . He called it " mustchep . " At the same time , he said he thought he might as well bottle his own barbecue sauce too. // " I brewed up the sauce in my kitchen , " Dr. Davis recalled modestly of his barbecue creation , K.C. Masterpiece , which took Kansas City by storm after it was introduced in 1977 . Eventually Dr. Davis went nationwide and was grossing $7 million a year when he was bought out in 1986 by the Clorox Corporation of Oakland , Calif . K.C. Masterpiece is now one of the top-selling barbecue sauces in supermarkets across the country . ( Kraft , which has been marketing its barbecue sauce since 1960 , is still the No. 1 commercially available sauce ) . " Mustchep " never took off. // Dr. Davis ' s name is now bandied about at barbecue contests and in backyards as thousands of Americans cook up their own special blends of tomato paste , vinegar , herbs and spices in the hopes that they too will be rewarded. // Jim Turner , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been entering his sauce for years in barbecue competitions under the name " Super Swine Sizzlers . " His sauce took first place and $5 , 750 in the " whole hog " competition last month at the annual Memphis in May Championship Barbecue Cooking contest. // But don ' t ask him for a recipe . He ' ll hem and haw , like so many barbecue hands like to do , wanting to be polite and appreciating the interest , but taking particular satisfaction in the secrecy of the invention. // " I make my own recipe , " Mr. Turner said cryptically when asked about his sauce . He would say only that he cooks 125-pound hogs , that he typically rubs the pig with lemon pepper , ground basil , garlic salt , dry mustard , onion salt , paprika and chili powder and then bastes with a mixture of water and concentrated lemon juice . The sauce he serves it with , he said , includes pineapple , cherries , cloves , brown sugar , ketchup and tomato paste , but he would not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher who lives in a Kansas suburb of Kansas City and was the Kansas state barbecue champion in 1984 , was more forthcoming about her barbecue secrets . To her , who is preparing the sauce and meat is as important as what goes into it. // " There is a lot of ego involved in this thing , " said Mrs. Kirk , who competed in the Lenexa Kansas Barbecue Cookoff last weekend , winning sixth place in the brisket competition. // Ardie Davis , a 47-year-old administrator in the Missouri Department of Aging , is the founder of the Diddy Wa Diddy National Barbecue Sauce Contest , devoted exclusively to barbecue sauce. // Mr. Davis , who describes himself as a food fanatic , grew up in Oklahoma , where , he said , he teethed on rib bones . While dreaming one day of the myriad sauces around the country that he had never been able to taste , he was inspired to write to barbecue restaurants nationwide , asking for samples of their sauces . What began as an informal taste test among neighbors has since grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Davis was listening to when the idea struck. // " It is a good nonsense word , " Mr. Davis said . " Taste is so subjective . For me to say this is best may mean nonsense to you . I thought it would be a good name for a tasting contest . Plus , you can ' t say it without smiling . Part of what I like about barbecue is that it ' s fun .
