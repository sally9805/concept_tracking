 | The rest of America is starting to realize what 's ahead from the tightfisted new administration in Washington . It began to hit home in early July that the billions in federal spending cuts that are coming will be felt by virtually everyone . Ahead lies a time of belt tightening as the nation swings away from a half-century of ever expanding federal largess . Even before Congress completes its work , some communities are scrapping projects ? for example , a 200-milliondollar trash-recycling operation in San Diego . Others , such as Kansas City , are getting ready to vote on a special sales tax . And some are proposing to take up the slack with substitute programs , as have officials in Concord , Calif. , who want to establish a local jobs program . Talks by staff members of US.News &; World Report with scores of local officials , community groups and special-interest organizations show that few segments of society will totally escape President Reagan 's crusade to control the federal budget . The precise amount of money trimmed from each program wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , acting in a frenzy on June 26 , approved 37.4 billion dollars in reductions , according to the Congressional Budget Office . A day earlier , the Senate had authorized 38.1 billion dollars in wide-ranging trims . A congressional conference must still clarify the cuts before final passage and signing by President Reagan . The changes from present law are to take effect in the 1982 fiscal year , beginning October 1 . At that point , local governments should brace for an " October surprise , " warns Brian Sheehan of the National Association of Counties . " That 's when they 'll really tally up what 's happened . " Ready for feedback . Lawmakers are already getting a taste of citizen reaction . Some members of Congress used their Fourth of July recess to conduct seminars in their hometowns and to explain , as best they could , what the budget exercise will mean . Early response from the voters : A combination of anger , uncertainty and applause . Lynn Martin ( R-Ill. ) , who represents the congressional district that includes Reagan 's hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly supportive . There 's a real acceptance of what has been done . " Said Albert Gore , Jr . ( D-Tenn . ) : " Most people are waiting for that other shoe to drop , wondering how budget cuts really will affect them . " But William Brodhead , a Detroit-area Democrat , detected another viewpoint : " What I 'm hearing from people who voted for Reagan is that they never expected budget cuts so severe . A fair word for their reaction is outrage . " Alarmist predictions are being heard . There is a fear of urban rioting next summer in New York City by those who may feel disfranchised when the impact of spending cuts is felt fully . Puerto Rican officials forecast a possible mass migration to the mainland by up to a half-million islanders in search of dwindling welfare benefits and jobs . Some concerns are unusual , except to the people they hit directly : Ramsey County , Minn. , which includes St. Paul . will spend $536,000 in the next 18 months ? money previously provided by Washington ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who assisted the U.S. war effort in Southeast Asia . But immediate worries are more routine : No salary hikes for city employes in Defiance , Ohio , for instance . Officials in most areas are braced for an onslaught of complaints from their residents over three broad areas : The loss of public and private jobs that could total 1.25 million , according to the AFL-CIO . Dade County , Fla .. which includes Miami , would lose nearly 14 million dollars to fund 1,300 jobs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act . In Gary , Ind. , a city that relies on the depressed steel industry , Mayor Richard Hatcher says that 21 percent of city employes will have to be laid off because of the CETA reductions . Chicago CETA worker Gloria Walter , who supports nine children and one grandchild , will lose her position as a homemaker assistant on July 15 . " I really do n't have the education that 's needed for a job of today , " she says . Stiff boosts in mass-transit fares , trash-collection fees and scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns in Maryland , for instance , expect to cut services or boost user fees in the coming year , says the National League of Cities . So many previously free services may become pay-as-you-go that there might come a time when " Little Leaguers will pay 50 cents every time they bat , " muses Sheehan of the National Association of Counties . Painful cutbacks in many social services that date back to the 1960s . These encompass dozens of programs , including school lunches , food stamps ,  | legal services for the poor and low-income housing . " Once people begin to understand exactly what has been cut , they 're going to be coming to local governments to make up the revenue , " says William Murphy , county executive of Rensselaer County in Upstate New York . " I 'm the guy who will have to answer the telephone . " Many states , cities and counties already recognize the impending pain . " I 'm disappointed because I think cities are having to take on a disproportionate share of the burden , " says San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing pressure . New York City officials estimate that up to 1 billion dollars will be lost in direct budget aid and in fewer benefits to citizens . One result : The potential closing of nearly 100 day-care and seniorcitizen centers . " Before I came here , I was stuck in the apartment alone all day . If the center closes , we 'll be out in the streets . This is our home , " comments Herminia Carrion , 73 , who uses the Fort Washington Senior Citizens Center in Manhattan . The city may also lose 26 million dollars in school aid , 18 million for bilingual education and 10 million in desegregation funding , as well as 11,500 public-service jobs . Boston officials figure that they will lose 50 million dollars ? and they could n't raise taxes if they wanted to because of Proposition 2 ? , which places limits on property-tax hikes . New Orleans is anticipating a loss of 130 million dollars in the next three years . It would have been used to fund public-service jobs , a revitalization operation in the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore foresees bus fares rising from the current 50 cents to $1.40 by 1985 . A subway system under construction may be halted . Some 13 communities , including 4Denver , St. Louis , Cincinnati and Los Angeles , with rapid rail systems on the drawing board may have to shelve their plans . Not every jurisdiction is crying the blues . Roy Orr , a Dallas , Tex. , county commissioner , says he does n't anticipate any problems because only 2 or 3 percent of his county budget is federal money . Likewise , says Columbus , Ohio , Finance Director Harmon Byer , his city should escape relatively unscathed : " There 's going to be less government , not more , but that 's what the people asked for . " At the state level , the situation is somewhat different in that statehouses will have more control over how money from federal block grants is spent . Nevertheless , states are nervous . Kentucky may be deprived of 400 million dollars , officials there say . The big losers : Food-stamp funds , publicservice jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's coal miners . - Maine could see the evaporation of 180 million dollars in federal aid . " We are talking about several thousand jobs  | affected directly or indirectly , " says Rodney Scribner , state commissioner of finance . Connecticut officials estimate the state will be denied 430 million dollars . Governor William O'Neill has pledged to avoid any tax hikes to make up the difference . Those Americans angry over Reagan 's initiatives are , for the most part , focusing their ire on cuts in popular social and education programs . Medical help . Cuts in medicaid for the poor are uncertain , but some officials predict what could happen if a cap is put on payments , as Reagan wants . " We now allow three prescriptions a month , " explains Merle Springer , a Texas health official . " We might have to reduce to two or to one or have the recipient pay the first 50 cents of each dollar . " In Cuyahoga County , Ohio , which includes Cleveland , each of the 130,000 medicaid recipients would lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two prescriptions , says Mark Real of the Greater Cleveland Interchurch Council , a group representing 72 Protestant churches . He fears that the cuts may also prompt 20 of the 50 hospitals now accepting medicaid in the Cleveland area to withdraw their support . The food-stamp program would take on a new character under the budget plan . The anticipated financial reduction over the next three years is about 6 billion dollars , says Robert Greenstein , director of the Project on Food Assistance and Poverty , an antipoverty group . To achieve those savings , an estimated 1 million persons would be removed from the program , and nearly all of the other 19 million recipients would have benefits reduced . Local groups in Pittsburgh expect some 6,000 food-stamp recipients to be dropped from the rolls . Cutbacks in school-lunch funds may mean that many youngsters will be faced with a 40-cent-a-day increase in lunch costs , according to the National School Boards Association . Low-income housing is another area of concern . The federal subsidy for such dwellings will fall to its lowest level since the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low-Income Housing Coalition . Adds Frank Hamsher , director of community development in St. Louis : " We 're going to have to find creative ways of doing more with less . " In public schools , the American Federation of Teachers estimates that more than 64,000 teaching positions will be eliminated in the next year . Moreover , dozens of programs operated by school systems will be pared . At the college-and-university level , cuts in student financial assistance could reduce nationwide enrollments by 500,000 to 700,000 students , estimates E. K. Fretwell , chancellor of the Univerity of North Carolina at Charlotte . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that assistance cuts will cost families with $25,000 incomes an extra $2,012 a year for each student . Many education officials are concerned that parents will borrow money to keep their children in school for a year or so , but then decide that the debt is too pressing and allow them to drop out . What 's clear is that more and more Americans are going to feel the pinch of a stingier Uncle Sam . " The real dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen , " says Eileen Maloney , the federal-aid cooridinator for Dade County , Fla . " The impact probably wo n't be felt until after October . " Reagan and Blacks : A Wide Gulf Despite assurances of " economic freedom " by President Reagan , black Americans are battening down the hatches for hard times ahead . At least that 's what leaders nationwide are telling fellow blacks to expect as a result of coming cuts in federal spending . In Denver , at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , Executive Director Benjamin Hooks warned that Reagan 's plans will lead to " hardship , havoc , despair , pain and suffering . " In Chicago , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , president of People Vnited to Save Humanity , forecast " an unprecedented economic depression " for blacks . In New York , Vernon Jordan , president of the National Urban League , predicted that " blacks and the poor will be devastated " by the budget cuts . The chagrin of blacks showed up at the NAACP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I genuinely and deeply believe that the economic package we have put forth will move us toward black economic freedom because it is aimed at lifting an entire country and not just parts of it . " Pie in the sky . Black leaders were not convinced . Hooks said of Reagan 's projections : " He promises 3 million new jobs by 1986 , but people ca n't live on promises of jobs five years from now . " The association itself joined with the AFL-CIO and other groups in calling for a " Solidarity Day " protest in Washington on September 19 . Blacks are complaining chiefly about cuts in funds for subsidized housing , welfare , food stamps and basic-education aid for the poor . In addition , the growth of the black middle class may suffer a setback , leaders warned . Said Jackson : " The black middle class is built on the public economy ? public education ; public transportation , Head Start , regulatory fairness , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , affirmative action . A lower ceiling on Small Business Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black community will be tremendous . The safety net will not catch us. "
