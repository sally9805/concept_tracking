The Worldwide Church and financial accountability <P> Jesus said : You can not serve both God and mammon . But these days it takes a heap of mammon to serve God . Religious establishments in the U.S. raise $20 billion or more a year . Most of the money is efficiently passed on to an assortment of spiritual and charitable works , with respectably small administrative costs . <P> However church money is handled , fiscal accountability is far looser than for other nonprofit organizations , which are required by law to keep records open to the public and follow standard bookkeeping practices . Churches have to meet no such formal standards and have been treated as exempt from government scrutiny under the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom . But more and more , church money raisers these days confront a growing public skepticism about how ecclesiastical cash is handled . <P> With some reason . Between 1970 and 1975 the Roman Catholic Pallottine Fathers of Baltimore were accused by Maryland 's attorney general of frittering away some $45 million in mission funds . The United Methodist Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year a layman who works for the AFL-CIO complained that his church had wrongly given $442,000 in aid to " totalitarians " who support revolutionary regimes in Cuba and elsewhere . Church officials contended that helping groups with Marxist ideas was a " risk " modern Christians must take to help the " oppressed . " <P> Many evangelical groups are free from scrutiny . In the monthly Eternity , Columnist Joseph Bayly complains that while worthy causes pinch pennies , cash flows freely to high-living evangelists subject only to boards led by relatives and retainers . To allay doubts , nondenominational ministries in 1979 created the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability ( E.C.F.A. ) to fix fund-raising standards . Many evangelists , including Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell , have won its seal of approval ; others , including Jim Bakker , Rex Humbard , Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson , have not . Bayly advises contributors to demand a financial statement even if a group has the E.C.F.A. seal : " If questions are dodged , assume it is a careless operation at best , fraudulent at worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California in 1979 seized financial control of an entire denomination , the 68,000-member Worldwide Church of God , charging that vast amounts of money and other assets had been misused . By any standard , the Worldwide Church is unusual . It is ruled by Herbert W. Armstrong , 88 , self-styled " Chosen Apostle " of God , who is preparing the one true church for the imminent collapse of world order and Christ 's return . Among other things , Armstrong denies the Trinity and insists that Christians should not celebrate Christmas or Easter ( considered " pagan " holidays ) . He inspires fanatical loyalty among followers and fierce enmity among defectors , and deftly uses his radio-TV show , The World Tomorrow , and his monthly Plain Truth magazine to lure converts . Members contribute a tenth or more of their income , and with proceeds of $66 million a year the church has no trouble financing Armstrong 's frequent tours to meet assorted world leaders .
