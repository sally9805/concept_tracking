Does Illinois still have a chance to go to the Cotton Bowl ? In a word , " No . " That was Cotton Bowl Executive Director Jim Brock ' s one-word answer Tuesday when asked if representatives of the bowl planned to attend either of Illinois ' final two games . Brock would neither confirm nor deny reports that a Southeast Conference team , probably Tennessee , has been chosen as the opponent for the Southwest Conference champion in the New Year ' s Day game in Dallas . " All I ' ll say is that everybody ' s got us taking the SEC , " said Brock . " All the media reports have the SEC in the Cotton Bowl . " Illinois is almost certain now to go to the Citrus Bowl , unless it loses its final two games , against Indiana and Northwestern . " Whether or not we have an agreement , I haven ' t said , " said Athletic Director and head football coach John Mackovic , " but we ' ve talked to them ( the Citrus Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were asked their preference Tuesday chose the Citrus Bowl over the Cotton Bowl because it ' s played in the warmer climate of Orlando . But the decision , Mackovic notes , " basically comes to myself and the staff and the chancellor . " That decision would be based partly on economics , and the Cotton Bowl pays nearly three times as much as the Citrus Bowl . " You can ' t discount the fact that there are three or four bowls that pay three times as much as the others pay , " observed Mackovic . If Illinois ever had a chance to go to the Cotton Bowl , it might have lost it last Friday when Brock was unable to get in to see Mackovic . " He didn ' t have time for me , " Brock said . " His secretary told me to come back at 4 : 45 , but I missed him all the way . " That probably was because Brock had an appointment to see Michigan coach Bo Schembechler at that time . But Brock and Mackovic are old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Brock said . " I think Illinois has a fine program and someday they ' ll be in Dallas . " " The bowls have to do what ' s in their best interest , too , " said Mackovic . The apparent decision to invite an SEC representative means the Cotton Bowl also has turned its back on Michigan , should the Wolverines stumble and not get into the Rose Bowl . But , said Brock , " I don ' t think Michigan ' s going to lose either of their last two games , do you ? " - Only four Big 10 teams appear certain to go to bowls , but most of the league ' s coaches think at least five will make it . Michigan , Illinois , Ohio State and Michigan State will be in postseason play . Because it has Anthony Thompson , Indiana will get a bid if it wins one of its final two games and finishes 6-5 . Michigan ' s Schembechler takes proprietary pride in the fact that half the conference will take a busman ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early 1970s that were such great teams and never got to go to a bowl are the reason all the others get to go now , and that ' s why I ' m so pleased , " Schembechler said. - Michigan State coach George Perles knows where he ' d like to play . " If we were good enough to win this Saturday and the following week , we ' d like to go to Hawaii and play in the Aloha Bowl , " said the always forthright Perles . Consider it a done deal. - Ohio State and Michigan will each be missing a starting defensive player when they meet two weeks down the road . But Ohio State ' s loss is easily the more significant . Linebacker Derek Isaman suffered a broken thumb in the Iowa game . " He underwent surgery today and he ' ll miss our two remaining games , " reported head coach John Cooper . Michigan has lost right defensive halfback Lance Dotter with a torn tendon on his ring finger . He , too , had surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl game , " said Schembechler .
