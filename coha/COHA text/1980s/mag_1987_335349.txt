In one of the most important criminal law rulings of the decade , the U.S. Supreme Court has given a new twist to the first axiom of American justice , that the accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty . In a 6-3 decision last week , the court upheld the controversial 1984 Bail Reform Act , by which Congress authorized the " preventive detention " of some federal suspects . For many years federal judges were forbidden to deny bail in most cases , except when there was reason to believe that a defendant might flee before trial . The new law has permitted those judges to refuse bail to thousands of suspects , most of them accused of violent and drug-related crimes , who could be shown to pose a danger to the " safety of any other person and the community . " In effect , the accused is presumed to be , if not guilty , at least the guilty type . <P> The court 's decision was warmly greeted by the law enforcement officials who have used the new law with vigor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money to meet high bail . Thirty-four states also permit the threat posed by the defendant to figure in some bail decisions . On the federal level , there has been about a 36% increase in pretrial detainees since the act was passed , from a daily average of 5,383 in 1984 to 7,328 last year , or about one-seventh of those in federal lockup . " It puts a burden on us to find jail space , " says Georgia U.S. Marshal Lynn Duncan . <P> Civil libertarians , however , warned that the court 's endorsement of the principle of preventive detention would change the complexion of American justice . Judges faced with potentially dangerous defendants had long practiced a de facto brand of preventive detention : setting bail so high that it could not be met . But the act legitimized what had until then been an unacknowledged purpose of many bail procedures . " This sends a dangerous message that the trial is an afterthought , " said Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz last week . New York Defense Lawyer Alan Silber was reminded of Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hearts , ' First the sentence , then the trial . ' " <P> The ruling came in the case of Mob Boss Anthony ( Fat Tony ) Salerno , head of the Genovese crime family , and Vincent Cafaro , a reputed captain in the same Mafia clan , who were charged last year with racketeering . A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that to deny them bail would violate constitutional guarantees of due process . <P> In reversing that decision , the Supreme Court ruled that pretrial detention is not an impermissible punishment forbidden by the Fifth Amendment , because it is not intended as punishment at all . Rather , it was designed by Congress as a " regulatory " act , with the legitimate Government goal of public safety . " The mere fact that a person is detained does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the government has imposed punishment , " Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the majority . <P> The Justices also found that the law contained sufficient safeguards for the rights of defendants . A detention decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate that no conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of the community . The defendant and his attorney may both be present to challenge evidence , cross-examine and present witnesses .
