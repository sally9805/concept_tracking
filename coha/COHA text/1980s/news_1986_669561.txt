Where the waiter calls you sir or madam , no matter what you ' re wearing. // Where there is a broad , kindly man in blue uniform and white gloves manning the gleaming brass innards of each elevator. // And where the ceilings are high and chandeliered , and huge wide windows look out over elegant , gray wintry gardens and malls. // Mostly , the Ritz-Carlton is full of grown-up people in mink coats . But recently , it started holding two-day seminars in good manners just for children called ' ' A Weekend of Social Savvy . ' ' They are open to all children aged 8-12 , at a price of $200 for five meals , a night at the Ritz , and instruction. // // The lessons are presided over by Miss Judith Re , directrice of the Judith Re Academie of Instruction in the Social Graces . The point of this is to become the sort of civilized person who feels at home in places like the Ritz-Carlton. // The weekend kicked off in the Ritz ' s handsome tea room. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith , after introducing herself to the 10 participants , who were politely drinking hot chocolate at a white linen covered table , and sitting a bit forward in the big damask armchairs to get the bend of the knee in the right place . ' ' This weekend you ' re going to strive for excellence. ' ' // In some circles , manners are a touchy subject . Some people mourn the fact that nowadays most adults would not know a social grace if it bit them , while others contend that the whole idea is stuffy and elitist. // Miss Judith , a gracious , black-haired woman in a black-and-pink suit with long pearls , put these concerns promptly to rest : ' ' Being considerate is what etiquette is all about , ' ' she said. // She led off by taking her charges on a tour of the hotel , starting in the main dining room - ' ' Entrez , s ' il vous plait , ' ' said the waiter in white tie , very grandly - then examining the kitchen , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once seen a wedding , until finally we ended up in the room where the first seminar was to be held , in flower arranging. // Miss Judith pulled a huge rustling sheaf of ferns , iris , and purple orchids out of tissue paper , and the children lit into it. // The result was a wonderfully spirited arrangement , with a miscellaneous breezy quality unobtainable by the adult , who is liable to freeze up in the presence of a hundred dollar ' s worth of flowers. // ' ' I like what you ' ve done with these flowers shooting out on either side . It gives it a very lovely presence , ' ' said Miss Judith. // ' ' It looks like a jungle , ' ' said Ian. // At lunch , as the waiter poured milkshakes into stem glasses with a flourish , Miss Judith explained all sorts of social subtleties : that gentlemen are supposed to bob up in their seats when a lady sits down , that you break your roll a little piece at a time , that you wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there is an elegant and not-so-elegant way to sneeze at the table. // Ian said that he sometimes sneezed into his elbow ' ' if it ' s kind of a surprise. ' ' // ' ' That ' s very creative , but there are other ways , ' ' replied Miss Judith kindly , demonstrating the correct graceful turn of the head and use of the napkin. // Since this was the very first Savvy weekend , a TV news team was there to record the event. // As Miss Judith suggested using a piece of bread to help with skittish peas ( ' ' that ' s very acceptable ' ' ) the cameraman , whose shirt was somewhat unbuttoned over a hairy chest , jerked his thumb toward the group and asked the producer , ' ' You want me to grab some of this ? ' ' // Teatime - aside from the camera and sound men trailing after the waiter as he poured tea and distributed eclairs for everyone - was like a scene from Renoir. // Miss Judith led a supremely polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers and sisters enjoyed by all the people present , and about the fact that there was enough snow to do snow men and animals ( everyone agreed this was so ) , and other topics of general interest. // ' ' What are we doing here ? ' ' said Miss Judith . ' ' We ' ve been eating and enjoying each other ' s company - that ' s what small talk is all about . We ' ve found that some like the snow and others built snowmen and that some enjoy fresh snowfall . That ' s getting to know the other person , taking time to ask questions that they will enjoy answering. // ' ' It ' s nice when someone takes an interest in you. ' ' // Next , Miss Judith introduced Mr. Tom Adams to help discuss the correct way to answer the telephone. // Ivan described his telephone technique : ' ' I go like ' See you later ' and hang up. ' ' // Kavonya said in a soft little voice , ' ' I say ' Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for calling , Mr. Jones , and it was a pleasure speaking with you , ' ' suggested Mr. Adams expansively. // Miss Judith then spoke on the importance of writing thank you letters . She had all the children write a practice one , on handsome blue and cream Ritz stationery , thanking the manager of the Ritz for the weekend of social savvy. // There was the thoughtful silence that accompanies creative endeavor. // ' ' How do you spell ' social ' ? ' ' asked Lydia. // Then it was time for dinner in the dining room , with all the children en grande toilette in velvet , sashes , and hairbows , or suits and ties . They sat in gold brocade armchairs while a pianist played ' ' If they could only paint a portrait of my love , ' ' and solemnly discussed the menu , which was to lead off with mock truffle soup with puff pastry turtle. // ' ' I guess truffles are a kind of turtle , ' ' said Ian gravely. // Miss Judith , in a slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat soup ( something on which even the most manners-conscious are tempted to do a little corner cutting ) , and her pupils nobly did as directed , despite drips. // Time for more hints : if the soup is boiling hot , the thing to do is to quickly swallow it and then take a sip of water . Miss Judith explained that the ostentatious fanning of the open mouth does not fall into the category of gracious behaviour. // The lights twinkled in the trees on Newbury Street as the children headed off to their dancing lesson . Mark Christopher , a handsome , elegantly smiling young man , taught them the basic step : Step , slide , step , slide . ' ' The lady puts her left hand on the gentleman ' s right shoulder ' ' - if she can reach it , that is. // To anyone who has ever been to dancing school , the scene had an odd , funny nostalgic quality : the little girls with their eyes glued to their feet , the little boys specializing in sudden changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side to side , one , two , one , two , regardless of the rhythm of ' ' Those were the days , my friend. ' ' // ' ' What are you doing ? ' ' Lydia asked Ivan. // ' ' Ladies , don ' t fight the movement of your dance partner , ' ' called Mr. Christopher . ' ' Ladies , please don ' t dance with each other , dance with the gentlemen. ' ' // As I left , Mary and Brooke were capering about together. // Mary paused to admire KaVonya ' s black velvet skirt , so KaVonya obligingly spun on one heel to demonstrate its full beauty. // Downstairs , the coat check attendant handed over my down coat , holding it in her arms so carefully that for a second I imagined gleaming sable folds spilling down over the counter ; then it was off into the chilly streets of Boston , which could use a little social savvy , honestly. // //                @ @ @ @ @
