The geography of the past is studded with walled cities . Jerusalem and Rome , to name but two from antiquity , fortified themselves against enemies without . Later , in medieval times , the citizens of London and Paris built and rebuilt ramparts to safeguard their liberties , ones that many of their rural contemporaries , burdened with the feudal status of serf , were denied . Only in the 20th century has a city had a wall rammed through its innards , circumscribing the freedom of two-thirds of its people , forcing upon them a serf-like tie to the land . Only in Berlin . <P> Images of the violation recur . When Berliners in the Soviet-run sector woke on the morning of Aug. 13 , 1961 , to find families sundered and the city rived by barbed wire  --  and soon concrete  --  many frantically sought routes of escape . The Berlin Wall was meant to halt a tide of migrants to the West that had left East Germany short of workers and threatened the stability of the Communist regime : more than 2.7 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1949 , 30,000 in July 1961 alone . <P> At first , buildings along the new boundary afforded windows on the West . Many refugees leaped , some into fire nets , others to the pavement ; more than a few died in the fall . After the regime bricked up the windows , the resourceful tunneled beneath the 20-ft. " death strip " and its mines and gun emplacements . The most daring efforts came from Wall jumpers , who confronted head on the " antifascist protective barrier , " as the jargon of totalitarianism described the Wall . In their jagged sprints , dodging searchlight beams and bullets , they created a theater of longing where the value of freedom  --  and the maleficence of its denial  --  found an extraordinary visual expression . In 1962 , in one of the most publicized instances , 18-year-old Peter Fechter , an East Berlin bricklayer , was cut down by machine-gun fire as he tried to scale the Wall and , in plain view of Western policemen and reporters , was left lying for an hour while he bled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fechter was one of an estimated 75 who have been killed over the past 28 years while trying to escape across the barrier . <P> The significance of the Wall extended far beyond the city , far beyond Germany . It became an epitome of the partitioning of Europe , the overarching symbol of the cold war and one of the places where the Western alliance and the Warsaw Pact came gunsight to gunsight . After the magnificent oratory of John F. Kennedy 's " Ich bin ein Berliner " speech , it was de rigueur for U.S. Presidents  --  and other Western leaders  --  to come and shake their fists at the Wall and call down imprecations against those who had conceived and built it . But the barrier also stood as a reminder of the limits of power in the nuclear age . Paradoxically , the Wall , despised though it was , acted as a bulwark for stability in Europe , ratifying two spheres of influence and thus maintaining the alternative of cold war to hot war . It was the most palpable evidence of a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
