WHITE HOUSE The President 's Boswell <P> It is a historian 's dream : virtually unlimited access to the day-to-day activities of a sitting President to prepare the leader 's definitive biography . The news last week was that Author Edmund Morris , 45 , who won a 1980 Pulitzer Prize for The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt , will have the privilege of being Ronald Reagan 's shadow for the rest of his term . In the past three weeks , Morris has attended White House conferences , interviewed Reagan and several of his aides and even accompanied the President to Geneva aboard Air Force One . <P> For all that , Morris was a somewhat reluctant recruit for the job . State Department Chief of Protocol Selwa Roosevelt gave the Reagans Morris ' book on her husband 's grandfather , the start of a planned three-volume work . The Reagans enjoyed the book , and in 1983 close aides like Michael Deaver began an ultimately successful two-year courtship of the author . Morris will not write his book until Reagan leaves office , but his agent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reagan chronicle : more than $2 million.INDIANS A Mankiller Takes Over <P> " A petticoat government " was how one 18th century British observer described the workings of the Cherokee Indian tribe . Not only were women influential with the tribal elders , but those who had performed special acts of valor bore an honorific title : Beloved Woman . Despite such enlightened attitudes , no woman has ever headed the Cherokees , the nation 's second-largest tribe ( after the Navajo ) , whose 67,000 members live mainly in Oklahoma . That will change when the present Cherokee chief , Ross Swimmer , is confirmed by the Senate as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs . His elected tribal deputy , Wilma Mankiller , 40 , will then become the Cherokee Nation 's first female leader . <P> " Women are very often the focal point of the tribe , " notes Vincent Monico , a BIA spokesman , " because they run the family . " Of the 504 American tribes , 43 are headed by women . Man-killer , whose unusual last name was inherited from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two daughters . She will oversee some 45,000 acres of Cherokee land and the tribe 's industries , which have sales of about $12 million a year . Says she : " It 's like running a tiny , tiny country . " CIVIL RIGHTS Double-Barreled Discrimination <P> Yonkers ( pop . 191,000 ) , an industrial suburb just north of New York City , is a place divided . To the east of the Saw Mill River Parkway live most of the city 's whites ; to the west live most of its blacks and other minorities . In what may turn out to be a landmark civil rights decision , Federal Judge Leonard Sand ruled last week that the deliberate concentration of low-income housing projects on Yonkers ' west side resulted in a racially segregated public school system that " has clearly worked to the disadvantage of minority students . " It was the first time that a single case linked racial discrimination in housing and schools .
