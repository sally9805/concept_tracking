" The Shock of the New , " an eight-part weekly series that begins tonight at 8 on WGBH-TV , Channel 2 , may well be the best television footage ever devoted to the fine arts . The series , brilliantly written and presented with panache by Robert Hughes , the art critic of Time magazine , could even persuade you a vital relationship exists between the world we inhabit and the visual arts - a necessary key to our understanding of ourselves . At this writing I have seen the first two programs , " The Mechanical Paradise , " and " The Powers That Be " ( the second , an incisive exploration of politics and art , with Hitler ' s architect , Albert Speer , arguing there is a universal style which exalts political might from Albany , N.Y. , to Moscow , seems a highpoint ) , but the stimulation of Hughes ' ideas suggests a level of excellence throughout . Originally conceived as a sequel to " Civilisation , " the 13-episode ramble with Kenneth Clark through earlier art history , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NEA , is in fact totally different . " Civilisation , " for all the urbanity and learning of its host , Kenneth Clark , was a super slide-show in which an authority took the class through Gothic cathedrals , manuscript illumination and the world of the impressionists . It was , therefore , essentially static , and suffered from the basic problem of its format , that is , looking at slides is an activity unrelated to the way we see paintings . Looking at a work of art we do so not with the gelid eye of the camera , but with an individual mind . The lens , viewing a painting , offers only the information of a certain aspect . The human eye , in conjunction with the intellect , apprehends the picture in a different manner from the camera which is always adapting the conventions of art to its own medium . Hughes deflects this built-in problem by shifting his emphasis from the formal history of modern art styles to the impact of modernism on society . The nature of the modern sensibility then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes says , " is to set forth certain themes and opinions that seem to be issues , to help open a field rather than define it . " He does so right away with " The Mechanical Paradise , " which addresses changing ideas of time and space as the result of turn-of- the-century technology . " Modernity meant believing in technology , not craft ; in human perfectability , not original sin ; and , above all , in the ceaseless consumption of things and images of things . " " The Shock of the New " is at its dazzling best investigating modern life , at its weakest arguably when forced to fall back on the specialist aspects of visual art . I can not say that I regret this . I would rather hear about Cezanne ' s heroic doubt , his introduction of relativity into picture-making , because it places Cezanne within a general cultural context where each detail matters . Art history , Hughes might contend , is everybody ' s history . The contrast with Clark ' s approach is evident from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still separated from his mass audience by his tailoring , his Oxford accent and his mandarin discernment . Hughes , of course , is too acute to condescend , and is indeed as discerning , still his style is more informal . He has an accent , but the accent is Australian , and when we first see him , he is tieless and wearing an open- necked blue- and-white striped shirt . Furthermore , the mobility of the treatment , which employs film-clips , artist-interviews and filming on the sites where the artists worked , like George Braque ' s Estaque , keeps Hughes on camera less . There is constant fluid movement rather than a sense of a man in front of an object , who is imparting to us what he knows . The truly exciting element , however , must be the direct but literate script . While I have no idea how it relates to " The Shock of the New , " Hughes ' extensive study to be published in February by Knopf , it syn thesizes all sorts of insights . Aphorisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As far as today ' s politics are concerned , most art aspires to the condition of Muzak . It provides the background hum for power . " Or , in more extended vein : " In one sense the Large Glass ' ( by Marcel Duchamp ) is a glimpse into Hell , a peculiarly modernist Hell of repetition and loneliness . But it is also possible to see it as a declaration of freedom . It freed people from the obligation to be grateful to someone else for their pleasures . . . Its sterile and gratuitous functioning has made it a key image for an avant-garde that tended , increasingly , towards narcissism . Frigid people really make it , ' remarked Andy Warhol , the Dali of the seventies . " The 42-year-old Hughes , who was in Boston last week , has lived in a loft in Soho since 1970 , the neolithic time before Soho was chic . Critic Henry Fenwick has described him as " the most interestingly well-read man I have encountered in years , and the least pretentious , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a World War I ace ( 14 kills and an epic battle with von Richtofen ) , and Hughes spent his boyhood at a Jesuit boarding school in Australia before he provoked a family crisis by announcing his desire to become an artist . By way of compromise , he studied architecture ( the withering comment on the architecture of modern American universities , " classicism with a pastry- cutter , " comes from someone who has done penance at a drawing-board ) then dropped out to go to Italy and paint . " I was a rotten painter , " he now declares ; but in Italy he looked at an enormous amount of art with an assiduity worthy of Berenson , returned to London and wrote two books , one on Australian art , the other " Heaven and Hell in Western Art , " which was read by an editor at Time who liked it and offered Hughes the vacant post of art critic . Hughes is indeed as provocative as Fenwick ' s description , for within the compass of an hour or two his conversation last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a vocation , the lust of the contemporary American artist for Fame , what happens to the 35,000 art students who go into the world each year , the influence of Homer on classic Time-style with its involute sentences and hyphenated epithets ( Hughes doesn ' t write a house style , nor , he says , does anyone ask him to ) , and the paucity of film about major world artists . " Our material includes interviews with Magritte , Pollock , Kokoshka , Miro and others ; but when you consider the cinema is roughly contemporaneous with modernism , it ' s incredible how little artistic documentation exists on film . There ' s not a scrap of footage on Braque , for instance , or Soutine ; and as for Picasso , it ' s all post-World War II , when the media discover art . For the most part , Picasso on film is an old man in shorts , clowning with funny hats . Think of it , there ' s more film about the painting of LeRoy Nieman than about the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a situation Hughes finds challenging as well as depressing . In " The Shock of the New " television , or chewing gum for the eyes , at last becomes a potential movable feast .
