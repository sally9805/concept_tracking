So it seems to people about to begin investing . They know there are people out there who have made a lot of money - or at least have added to their financial security - with investment programs , and have managed to learn about things like dividends , yields , price/earnings ratios , and betas in the process. // Looking at the economic changes of the past decade or so , even those who have never invested know they must begin , somehow , somewhere , to reduce the financial uncertainty in their lives. // ' ' There ' s more of a consciousness of the necessity to plan for one ' s financial future , ' ' says Judith Johnson , senior vice-presdient at Advest , a Hartford , Conn. , brokerage . Many Americans who are in their 50s , 60s , and older did not need to bother about investing , because they ' ' floated along on the postwar boom , ' ' she adds . ' ' They really didn ' t need to do that much investing . Now people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my job . That income may not always be there . ' Now , they are turning toward ways to build assets , and the best way to do that is through investing. ' ' // There are generally three categories of people who want to begin systematic investment programs : those who have never invested beyond perhaps putting their savings in a money market mutual fund ; those who might have a few stocks a relative left them or have some shares of stock in the company where they work ; and those who have tried investing but haven ' t done very well at it and want to start over. // For all of these people , the first step in starting an investment program is not an investment step . It is to build savings , followed closely , or simultaneously , by setting goals. // // Build savings // ' ' When people come to me and want to start investing , I tell them the first thing they should do is provide food and shelter for their family , ' ' says Jack Pihl , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Then they should have an emergency fund , then insurance , then a home . Then , if there ' s any left over , that ' s when you can start buying stocks. ' ' // Two forms of savings should be built up before an investment program begins : immediately accessible savings and a retirement fund . Financial planners recommend the equivalent of three to six months ' take-home pay in a highly liquid , or accessible , account , like a money market fund or money market deposit account at a bank . It should be money you can get at today , or tomorrow at the latest. // Whether you have three or six months ' savings , or something in between , depends on how secure you feel about your job , your day-to-day financial needs , and the size of monthly bills like the mortgage . If you have very large mortgage payments relative to your salary , for instance , the savings should be closer to six months. // Building up this much savings will take time , perhaps two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re investing or not , to cover emergencies or special purchases. // The other savings program is the individual retirement account ( IRA ) or an employer-sponsored retirement program like a 401(k) salary reduction plan . With the tax breaks built into these plans , including the fact that they earn tax-free interest until retirement , there is really no excuse for not putting at least a few dollars a month ( how long will it have to be written that the $2 , 000-a-year deposit ceiling on IRAs is a maximum , not a minimum ? ) into a retirement account. // The tax-free interest also makes the IRA a good place to get introduced to some of the places you will be putting investment dollars later . In addition to banks and savings-and-loans , IRAs can be opened at mutual funds , insurance companies , and brokerages . At the latter , you can have a ' ' self-directed ' ' IRA , in which you move the money among stocks , bonds , or money funds as you like. // // Set goals // While you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commit yourself to some financial and personal goals . If you know what you want to do with the money you make investing , you will have an easier time making financial commitments . What do you expect to accomplish with your money - a new home , retirement , college for the children , all of these ? Or maybe you just want your money to do what you do every day - work hard and earn more money. // Whatever the goal , an overriding aim , from a financial point of view , should be to preserve and increase your real wealth . Accomplishing this requires both a defensive strategy - to hold on to your money - and an offensive strategy - to make sure that money earns more than inflation and taxes are taking away. // For example , says Vera Silverman , a partner with Silverman , Heller Associ-ates , a Los Angeles-based brokerage , if inflation is running at 4. 5 percent and you can get 9 percent in a money fund , then you should aim for at least a 13. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains. // // The learning period // The time it takes to build savings and outline goals can be put to good use to learn about investing and the different investment vehicles. // ' ' Get a good book and start to understand the market , ' ' says William H. Pike , a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston . His advice may be a bit selfserving , since he has written a book , ' ' Why Stocks Go Up ( and Down ) ' ' ( Dow Jones-Irwin , $19. 95 ) , but it is still good advice . Libraries and bookstores are full of books on investments , some of which are more useful than others . The beginner is probably better off avoiding those that promise huge gains or that concentrate heavily on one area , like options , real estate , or tax shelters. // Instead , a general book on money management with a few chapters on investing might be more useful . Books like ' ' Sylvia Porter ' s New Money Book for the 80s ' ' ( Doubleday ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' by Grace W. Weinstein ( New American Library ) , or ' ' The Power of Money Dynamics , ' ' by Venita VanCaspel ( Reston ) contain much of this basic information . For more detail , ' ' Successful Investing , ' ' by the staff of United Business Service in Boston , does a good job of covering the details of almost all types of investments . It may not be generally available in bookstores , but you can get a copy by sending $10. 95 to United Business Service , 210 Newbury Street , Boston , Mass. 02116. // While you ' re learning about the world of investing and saving , you can begin making some preliminary decisions about where you want to invest . To this end , Mr. Pike suggests picking a few industries - preferably those with which you already have some familiarity - and learning about them . People interested in or working with electronics , for example , would have a better chance of understanding what makes companies in that field tickthan those who just happen to notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their knowledge , Pike says , they might subscribe to a magazine specializing in the field , such as Electronics News. // Similarly , someone interested in the apparel industry might subscribe to Women ' s Wear Daily . These trade journals are often available in larger libraries , or the library should have addresses where you can write for subscriptions . A broker may also have some of them. // // First investments // Probably the best place for a beginning investor to put some money is a mutual fund . There are literally hundreds of funds , with a wide range of investment goals and a variety of portfolios to reflect those goals. // Like any good investor , most of these funds are widely diversified , sometimes with several dozen stock issues . When you send away for a prospectus and application , you should also get a copy of the fund ' s most recent annual or quarterly report . Here , you can see what stocks the fund is holding . After you invest , you will continue to receive these reports , so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying. // For most investors , Mr. Pihl of Thomson McKinnon suggests a no-load mutual fund with a telephone switching service . ' ' You can move your investment based on market swings and economic changes without having to worry about individual stocks , ' ' he says . ' ' The client can manage his own portfolio. ' ' // Some mutual funds have initial deposit requirements of $1 , 000 or more , but these limits are usually lower for IRA and Keogh accounts . Also the IRA , particularly for people with some time to go before retirement , is a good place to try out some of these switching techniques and still have time to recover from any mistakes. // Another advantage of mutual funds for the beginning investor is that they are more suited to a regular , disciplined program of deposits , by which you send in the same amount every month or so . Some funds will let you arrange an automatic withdrawal from your checking or savings acount , if you have trouble saving. // You can get information on funds from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers for names , addresses , and phone numbers. // // Venturing into stocks // Until now , the pre-investment and investment decisions have been pretty straightforward : Save , set goals , learn , and let someone else make the stock-buying decisions through mutual funds . But to choose among the thousands of stocks offered on the New York and American Stock Exchanges , as well as regional exchanges , requires more research than most people have . Also , even in a bull market , an investor can get hurt when the rampage slows down , as it did in January and February. // ' ' You could have given everything back in this last market , and a lot of people have , ' ' notes Ms. Silverman of Silverman , Heller Associates. // Someone starting out in the stock market should not be trying to pick high-growth stocks , even though the rewards can be great . The risks are at least as bad , says Ms. Johnson of Advest. // ' ' If you put in $2 , 000 with the intention of turning it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she says . ' ' Beware of unrealistic expectations . ' ' She , too , feels that a return of ' ' around ' ' 13 to 15 percent in capital gains and dividends is a realistic goal. // Achieving this goal usually means sticking to stocks with little volatility in price , those that have a long record of paying increased dividends , and ones engaged in ' ' stable businesses , ' ' says Brenton Dickson , senior vice-president for investment research at State Street Bank in Boston . Many of these are the so-called ' ' blue chips , ' ' on which the prices may not go up very much , but which don ' t suffer big long-term drops , either. // Some of the industries that fit this description are beverages and other consumer products , some utilities , oil and health-care companies , and some technology concerns . In the latter category , Mr. Dickson prefers IBM and , for longer-term prospects , Hewlett-Packard. // In beverages , he mentions Coca-Cola and PepsiCo . Procter &; Gamble and Kodak are also good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some current problems , in the longer term it is interesting. ' ' // He says utilities are often marked by slower growth but higher yields . In this group , he said , ' ' we like some of the Bell ( American Telephone &; Telegraph Company ) spinoffs , ' ' including Bell Atlantic and NYNEX , which serves New York state and New England. // Other stocks mentioned by analysts to fit this conservative strategy include Exxon , Mobil , Middle South Utilities , San Diego Gas &; Electric , Aetna insurance , American Express , Colgate-Palmolive , and Kellogg. // Although people should diversify among stocks and industries , investors - beginning or experienced - who do not trade stocks on a full-time basis should not try to hold too many securities . It is just not possible to follow very many at once with care . Most experts say around 10 is about the limit for the average investor. // ' ' I only own eight different stocks , and I have all day to do this , ' ' Fidelity ' s Mr. Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could put $800 to $1 , 000 in five or six stocks , ' ' Mr. Dickson adds . ' ' But be careful they ' re in different businesses. ' ' // Finally , Ms. Silverman says , once you ' ve decided what stocks to buy and how many , ' ' don ' t just hand over your money and be passive . Keep up with your stocks and the industries . Even if your broker is good , you ' re much more interested in your own money than they are . Being a passive investor is a good way to get hurt. ' ' // The process of making investment decisions includes evaluating several factors , including income , the amount available for investment and the level of risk the investor can comfortably accept . This table , prepared with the help of the College for Financial Planning in Denver , suggests some investment that might be considered under various circumstances . **22;24223; <> **44;24247; **44;24293; **44;24339; **44;24385; <> **76;24431; **28;24509; Amount <> **28;24539; **28;24569; Levels of Risk <> <> **76;24599; **28;24677; available <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medium <> **28;24875; High <> <> **76;24905; **48;24983; Taxable income : $20 , 000-$30 , 000 <> <> **76;25033; <> <> Money funds <> <> Stamps , Coins , Rare <> <> **76;25111; <> $ 2 , 500 <> <> CDs <> <> books , Photographs <> **26;25189; Penny stock <> <> **76;25217; <> <> <> Prints <> <> **76;25295; <> <> Municipal bond funds <> <> Growth stock funds <> **26;25373; Stock options <> <> **76;25401; <> $ 5 , 000 <> <> Common stock funds <> <> Persian rugs <> **26;25479; Commodity options <> <> **76;25507; <> <> <> Blue chip stocks <> **26;25585; New equity issues <> <> **76;25613; <> $10 , 000 <> <> Treasury bills <> <> Corporate bonds <> **26;25691; ' Special Situation ' or <> <> **76;25719; <> <> <> **26;25797; ' turnaround ' stocks <> <> **76;25825; **48;25903; Taxable income : $30 , 000-$45 , 000 <> <> **76;25953; <> <> Money funds <> <> Stamps , Coins , Rare <> <> **76;26031; <> $ 2 , 500 <> <> CDs <> <> books , Photographs <> **26;26109; Penny stocks <> <> **76;26137; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond funds <> <> Growth stock funds <> **26;26293; Stock options <> <> **76;26321; <> $ 5 , 000 <> <> Common stock funds <> <> Persian rugs <> **26;26399; Commodity options <> <> **76;26427; <> <> Unit trusts <> <> Blue-chip stocks <> **26;26505; New equity issues <> <> **76;26533; <> <> Treasury bills <> <> Corporate bonds <> <> **76;26611; <> $10 , 000 <> <> Income-producing <> <> Zero-coupon bonds <> **26;26689; Special-situation stocks <> <> **76;26717; <> <> real-estate partnerships <> <> Convertable bonds <> <> **76;26795; <> <> <> Growth real estate <> <> **76;26873; <> <> <> partnerships <> <> **76;26951; <> <> <> Paintings <> <> **76;27029; <> <> <> Antique furniture <> <> **76;27107; **48;27185; Taxable income : $45 , 000 and over <> <> **76;27235; <> <> Money funds <> <> Stamps , Coins , Rare <> **26;27313; Stock options <> <> **76;27341; <> $ 2 , 500 <> <> CDs <> <> books , Photographers <> **26;27419; Commodity options <> <> **76;27447; <> <> <> Prints <> <> **76;27525; <> <> Blue-chip stocks , Stock options <> <> Growth stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 5 , 000 <> <> ( writing them on own stock portfolio ) <> <> real estate partnerships <> **26;27709; High-tech stocks <> <> **76;27737; <> <> Tax-exempt bonds , Unit trusts <> <> Persian rugs <> **26;27815; ' Junk ' bonds <> <> **76;27843; <> <> Treasury bills <> <> Convertable bonds <> **26;27921; Precious metals <> <> **76;27949; <> $10 , 000 <> <> Single-premium , <> <> stocks <> **26;28027; ( gold , silver ) <> <> **76;28055; <> <> interest-bearing <> <> Zero-coupon bonds$ <> **26;28133; Commodities funancial <> <> **76;28161; <> <> whole-life policy <> <> Equipment leasing <> **26;28239; futures <> <> **76;28267; <> <> Tax-managed <> <> ( income producing ) <> **26;28345; gems , R &; D shelters <> <> **76;28373; <> <> mutual funds <> <> Paintings <> **26;28451; Agressive real estate <> <> **76;28479; <> <> Deferred annuities <> <> Antique furniture <> **26;28557; partnerships <> <> **76;28585; <> <> Income-producing real <> <> **26;28663; Oil/gas drilling <> <> **76;28691; <> <> estate partnerships <> <> programs <> <> **76;28769; <> <> <> **26;28847; Movie partnerships <> <> **76;28875; <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> **26;29059; partnerships <> <> <> <> // //
