Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and Benazir Bhutto gave all appearances of having made a deal . Bhutto , the leader of the outlawed Pakistan People 's Party , the most popular political movement in the country , was allowed to return to Pakistan from Britain last month for the burial of her brother Shahnawaz , who died under mysterious circumstances in the south of France last July . Her part of the deal was not to engage in antigovernment political activities during her visit . Last week , however , the bargain was called off and the charismatic Bhutto was placed under house arrest at the family home in Karachi . <P> The President 's move was preceded by a flurry of political activity by Bhutto , the daughter of the former Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who was hanged by the Zia government in 1979 . She received several opposition leaders at her Karachi home and called for a return to democracy . Then she insisted on visiting the families of two party activists hanged earlier this year after being convicted of murdering a pro-Zia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President decided he had had enough and ordered the police to turn her home into a prison . <P> When Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon last June , it warned that attacks on northern Israel would provoke retaliation . Last week , after rocket assaults on northern settlements , the death of two Israeli soldiers in a south Lebanon ambush and a string of suicide car-bomb attacks , the country made good its vow . Backed by helicopter gunships and heavy armor , Israeli troops stormed into three Lebanese Shi'ite communities near Israel 's border . The primary target was Qabrikha , from where , Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said , Israel has been attacked by Katyusha rockets . The Israelis ordered residents out of their homes , then conducted house-to-house searches for weapons . <P> At the same time that its forces were detaining about 30 suspects , Israel announced the release of an additional 113 who were being held at the Atlit prison near Haifa . Freedom for the Atlit prisoners was one of the principal demands made by the hijackers of Trans World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain at Atlit . <P> Elsewhere , the value of marriage may be incalculable , but in the United Arab Emirates , men feel that it is not worth $50,000 . Women often demand sums of that size in the Emirates , where dowries are supplied by grooms rather than by brides . Young women in this Persian Gulf federation of sheikdoms view the dowry as an insurance policy . Because Islamic law allows men to take up to four wives and obtain divorces easily , brides believe they risk losing their husbands ' affection . <P> But as the price of an Emirates bride has increased , the sheikdoms ' men have turned to foreign brides , particularly from India , Sri Lanka and the Philippines , who typically settle for dowries of only about $1,000 . Such marriages are now thought to account for as many as half of all those in the sheikdoms , raising government fears that the region 's Arab identity will be diluted . To lure men away from the non-Arab brides , the government is / considering a national fund to subsidize the dowries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emirates have another solution : give wives more rights , they say , and the bride price will drop . <P> WORLD NOTES <P> UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
