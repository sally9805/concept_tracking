Of the 120,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually in the U.S. , as many as 90,000 occur in women who are postmenopausal or over 50 . In roughly half of these older women , the malignant cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes ; some 30% die of recurring cancer within five years after surgery . That grim toll may soon be reduced . A National Institutes of Health advisory panel last week recommended the postsurgery use of a drug called tamoxifen in most of these cases , saying that it could cut the death rate by 20% . <P> Tamoxifen 's effectiveness stems from the fact that the proliferation of breast-cancer cells in two-thirds of older women seems dependent on estrogen , the female sex hormone . The drug acts by blocking receptors for estrogen on the surfaces of cells that have migrated from the breast tumor , thus halting the division of the cells and preventing them from seeding tumors in other parts of the body . Unlike conventional chemotherapy , which usually causes loss of hair and severe nausea , tamoxifen produces only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nausea , and only in about one-quarter of patients . <P> Still , the drug is not a cure-all . The NIH panel reported that it is ineffective against breast-cancer cells that are not estrogen dependent and seems to have little effect in premenopausal women , who respond best to a combination of chemotherapy drugs . The panel stressed that most older breast- cancer victims whose lymph nodes have not been invaded by malignant cells need neither tamoxifen nor chemotherapy after surgery , but urged that they have frequent checkups.
