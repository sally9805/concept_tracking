One of those abducted was William Buckley , C.I.A. station chief in Beirut , seized on March 16 , 1984 . Available intelligence suggested that most , if not all , of the Americans were held hostage by members of Hezbollah , a fundamentalist Shiite terrorist group with links to the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini. // Second , the U.S. Government had a latent and unresolved interest in establishing ties to Iran . Few in the U.S. Government doubted Iran ' s strategic importance or the risk of Soviet meddling in the succession crisis that might follow the death of Khomeini . For this reason , some in the U.S. Government were convinced that efforts should be made to open potential channels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve both the release of the hostages and a strategic opening to Iran. <> <> * * * <> <> THE ISRAELIS PROVIDE A VEHICLE // While the N.S.C. staff was seeking a re-examination of U.S. policy toward Iran , several staff members were growing ever more concerned about the hostage issue . On June 14 , 1985 , T.W.A. flight 847 was hijacked en route from Athens to Rome , with 135 U.S. citizens aboard . It was not until June 29 that all the hostages were released . One U.S. citizen was executed . The event dominated the news in the United States and dramatized the hostage issue . Frustration at the lack of progress in freeing the hostages in Beirut grew perceptibly within the U.S. Government , especially in the face of pleas to the President for action by the families of the hostages . In the summer of 1985 , a vehicle appeared that offered the prospect of progress both on the release of the hostages and a strategic opening to Iran. // Israel had longstanding interests in a relationship with Iran and in promoting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both objectives . It also offered a means of strengthening Iran against Israel ' s old adversary , Iraq . Much of Israel ' s military equipment came originally from the United States , however . For both legal and political reasons , Israel felt a need for U.S. approval of , or at least acquiescence in , any arms sales to Iran . In addition , elements in Israel undoubtedly wanted the United States involved for its own sake so as to distance the United States from the Arab world and ultimately to establish Israel as the only real strategic partner of the United States in the region. // Iran badly wanted what Israel could provide . The United States had been the primary source of arms for the Shah , but U.S. shipments to Iran were now barred by the embargo . Iran desperately wanted U.S.-origin TOW and HAWK missiles , in order to counter Iraq ' s chief areas of superiority - armor and air forces . Since Israel had these weapons in its inventory , it was an alternative source of supply . Israel was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the United States approved the transfer and would agree to replace the weapons. <> <> * * * <> <> An Opening to Iran. // On the 4th or 5th of May , 1985 , Michael Ledeen , an N.S.C. staff consultant , with the knowledge of Mr. McFarlane , went to Israel and met with Prime Minister Peres. <> <> * * * <> <> The July Requests. // On July 3 , 1985 , David Kimche , the Director General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry , met at the White House with Mr. McFarlane . Mr. McFarlane told the board that Mr. Kimche asked the position of the U.S. Government toward engaging in a political discourse with Iranian officials . He recalled Mr. Kimche as saying that these Iranian officials had conveyed to Israel their interest in a discourse with the United States . Contact was to be handled through an intermediary ( later disclosed to be Mr. Ghorbanifar ) who was represented as having good connections to Iranian officials. // This was not the first time that Mr. Ghorbanifar had come to the attention of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of contacts with him . C.I.A. ' s first contact with Ghorbanifar was through a European intelligence service in January 1980 . From the beginning , C.I.A. found it " difficult to filter out the bravado and exaggeration from what actually happened . " Other intelligence services had similar experiences with Mr. Ghorbanifar . By September of 1980 , C.I.A. decided to drop efforts at recruiting Ghorbanifar . It considered him neither reliable nor trustworthy. // In addition , Theodore Shackley , a former C.I.A. official , had met Mr. Ghorbanifar in Hamburg , West Germany , between November 19-21 , 1984 . Mr. Ghorbanifar at that time suggested payment of a cash ransom for the hostages in Beirut , with himself as middleman . This proposal , contained in a memorandum prepared by Mr. Shackley , dated November 22 , 1984 , apparently reached the State Department where it elicited no interest . A memorandum from Mr. Shackley , dated June 7 , 1985 , containing a later suggestion by Mr. Ghorbanifar that the ransom involve items " other than money , " also drew no response . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McFarlane apparently did not know this background or even that Mr. Ghorbanifar was the intermediary Mr. Kimche had in mind .

Mr. McFarlane recalled responding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimche then asked what the U.S. reaction would be if Israel shipped weapons to Iran , and whether the United States would sell replacements " whether it ' s HAWK ' s or TOW ' s or whatever else .

" Mr. Regan also told the board that in early September , Mr. McFarlane informed the President that Israel had sold arms to the Iranians and hoped to get some hostages out . Mr. Regan stated that the President was " upset " at the news and that Mr. McFarlane explained that the Israelis had " simply taken it upon themselves to do this . " Mr. Regan said that after some discussion , the President decided to " leave it alone.

He noted that very possibly , the transfer was brought to him as already completed . He said that subsequently there were arms shipments he authorized that may have had to do with replenishment , and that this approval for replenishment could have taken place in September .

The Israelis were to deliver 80 HAWK missiles to a staging area in a third country , at noon on Friday , Nov. 22 . These were to be loaded aboard three chartered aircraft , which would take off at two-hour intervals for Tabriz , Iran . Once launch of the first aircraft had been confirmed by Mr. Ghorbanifar , directions would be given to release the five U.S. citizens held hostage in Beirut . No aircraft was to land in Tabriz until all the hostages had been delivered to the U.S. embassy in Beirut . Israel would deliver 40 additional HAWK ' s at a later time . The Iranians would commit to seeing that there were no further hostages seized. // Secretary Shultz told the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about a plan that would produce the release of the hostages on Thursday , November 21 . Secretary Shultz told the board he told Mr. McFarlane that had he known of it earlier , he would have stopped it . He nonetheless expressed the hope to Mr. McFarlane that the hostages would be released . It is not clear what other N.S.C. principals , if any , were told in advance about the plan. // Secretary Shultz said he told an associate on November 22 that " Bud says he ' s cleared with the President " on the plan . Chief of staff Regan told the board that the President was informed in advance of the Israeli HAWK shipment but was not asked to approve it . He said that Mr. McFarlane told the President early in the month on the margins of his briefings for the Geneva summit to expect that a shipment of missiles would come from Israel through a third country to Iran , and that the hostages would come out. // In his first meeting with the board on January 16 , 1987 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came about . The President said he objected to the shipment , and that , as a result of that objection , the shipment was returned to Israel. // In his second meeting with the board on February 11 , 1987 , the President stated that both he and Mr. Regan agreed that they can not remember any meeting or conversation in general about a HAWK shipment . The President said he did not remember anything about a call-back of the HAWK ' s. <> <> * * * <> <> Failure. // In contrast to the August TOW shipment , the United States became directly involved in the November transfer of the HAWK missiles . Sometime on November 17 or 18 , 1985 , while Mr. McFarlane was in Geneva for the November summit , Mr. Rabin called Mr. McFarlane to say that a problem had arisen . Mr. McFarlane referred the matter to LtCol North. // North signed a letter for Mr. McFarlane dated November 19 , 1985 , requesting Richard Secord , a retired U.S. Air Force general officer , to proceed to a foreign country , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped from Israel . That day Mr. Secord made arrangements for trans-shipment of the Israeli HAWK ' s. // But late in the day on November 21 , these arrangements began to fall apart . The foreign government denied landing clearance to the aircraft bringing the HAWK ' s from Israel . LtCol North contacted Duane Clarridge of the C.I.A. for assistance in obtaining the required landing clearance . When the C.I.A. ' s efforts failed , LtCol North asked Mr , Clarridge to find a reliable commercial carrier to substitute for the Israeli flight . Mr. Clarridge put Mr. Secord in contact with a carrier that was a C.I.A. proprietary. // The plan went awry again on November 22 , when Mr. Schwimmer allowed the lease to expire on the three aircraft they had chartered to take the HAWK ' s to Tabriz . Mr. Secord was able to provide an aircraft for this leg of the journey , however . The C.I.A. arranged for overflight rights over a third country .

VADM Poindexter was named national security adviser on December 4 . That said day , LtCol North raised with VADM Poindexter a new proposal for an arms-for-hostages deal . It involved the transfer of 3 , 300 Israeli TOW ' s and 50 Israeli HAWK ' s in exchange for release of all the hostages . The arms were to be delivered in five installments , spread over a 24-hour period . Each installment was to result in the release of one or two hostages , so that in the end all five U.S. citizens held in Beirut and a French hostage would be freed .

In his meeting with the board on Jan. 26 , 1987 , the President said he recalled discussing a complex Iranian proposal for weapons delivered by the Israelis in installments prior to the release of the hostages . The President said that Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger objected to the plan , and that this was the first time he " noted down " their disapproval . The President said that the discussion at the meeting produced a stalemate. // Secretary Weinberger told the board he argued strongly against the complicated arms and hostages plan , and that he was joined in his opposition by Secretary Shultz .

Immediately after the meeting , Mr. McFarlane left for London to meet with Mr. Ghorbanifar and others to discuss the plan . There is no evidence that Mr. McFarlane was given any written instructions for the trip. // Mr. McFarlane ' s message at the London meeting was that , while the United States wanted the U.S. hostages released , and would be interested in better relations with Iran , it was making no offer of arms . According to a memorandum written by LtCol North , Mr. Ghorbanifar refused to transmit this message to his Iranian contacts , reportedly stating that to do so would endanger the lives of the hostages . There appears to be no formal record of the London meeting. <> <> * * * <> <> The Arms/Hostages Link Re-established. // The President was clearly quite concerned about the hostages . Mr. McFarlane told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare of the hostages . Chief of staff Regan is reported to have told reporters on Nov. 14 , 1986 , that " the President brings up the hostages at about 90 percent of his briefings . " Mr. Regan is reported to have said that each morning at the daily intelligence briefing , the President asked VADM Poindexter , " John , anything new on the hostages ? " // The premise of the McFarlane December 7 trip had been to try to break the arms/hostage link . However , on December 9 , LtCol North submitted to VADM Poindexter a memorandum proposing direct U.S. deliveries of arms to Iran in exchange for release of the hostages , using Mr. Secord to control Mr. Ghorbanifar and the delivery operation . The Dec. 9 memorandum raises at least a question as to whether LtCol North , who accompanied Mr. McFarlane to the London meeting , fully supported the thrust of McFarlane ' s instructions in his own conversations in London with Mr. Ghorbanifar and others. // During the rest of December , LtCol North , Mr. Ghorbanifar , Mr. Ledeen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The President did not recall signing the Jan. 6 draft. // The President told the board that he had several times asked for assurances that shipments to Iran would not alter the military balance with Iraq .

That note also indicates that the Vice President , Mr. Regan , and Donald Fortier were present for the briefing. // Although the draft Finding was virtually identical to that signed by the President on January 6 , the cover memorandum signaled a major change in the Iran initiative . Rather than accepting the arrangement suggested by Mr. Nir , the memorandum proposed that the C.I.A. purchase 4 , 000 TOW ' s from DOD and , after receiving payment , transfer them directly to Iran . Israel would still " make the necessary arrangements " for the transaction. // This was an important change . The United States became a direct supplier of arms to Iran .

During the meeting , LtCol North misrepresented his access to the President and attributed to the President things the President never said. // In presenting the Bible , LtCol North related the following story to the Iranians : // " We inside our Government had an enormous debate , a very angry debate inside our Government over whether or not my President should authorize me to say ' We accept the Islamic Revolution of Iran as a fact . . . . ' He the President went off one whole weekend an prayed about what the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that passage I gave you that he wrote in front of the Bible I gave you . And he said to me , ' This is a promise that God gave to Abraham . Who am I to say that we should not do this ? ' " In reality , the idea of the Bible and the choice of the inscription were contained in an October 2 , 1986 , memorandum from LtCol North to VADM Poindexter . The Bible was to be exchanged for a Koran at the October 5-7 meeting . VADM Poindexter approved the idea and the President inscribed the Bible the next morning . The President told the board that he did inscribe the Bible because VADM Poindexter told him this was a favorite passage with one of the people with whom the U.S. was dealing in Iran . The President said he made the inscription to show the recipient that he was " getting through. " // At two points during the October 5-7 Frankfurt meetings , LtCol North told two stories of private discussions with the President at Camp David . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran-Iraq war on terms acceptable to Iran . The second had the President saying that the gulf states had to be convinced that it was Saddam Hussein of Iraq that was " causing the problem. " // When pressed by the Iranians for an explicit statement of what the United States means by " an honorable victory " for Iran , LtCol North replied : " We also recognize that Saddam Hussein must go. " // The President emphasized to the board that these statements are an " absolute fiction " and that there were no meetings as LtCol North describes . In addition , Mr. McDaniel noted that on October 3 , 1986 , the President reaffirmed that the United States wanted neither Iran nor Iraq to win the war. // At the October 5-7 meeting , LtCol North laid out a seven-step proposal for the provision of weapons and other items in exchange for Iranian influence to secure the release of all remaining U.S. hostages , the body of William Buckley , a debrief by his captors , and the release of John Pattis , a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months earlier . The Iranians presented a six-point counterproposal that , in part , promised the release of one hostage following receipt of additional HAWK parts and a timetable for future delivery of intelligence information . The Iranians made clear that they could not secure the release of all the hostages . Mr. Cave recalls that the Iranians proposed exchanging 500 TOW ' s for the release of two hostages . He stated that the U.S. side agreed. // A second meeting was held in Frankfurt on October 26-28 at which the parties finalized the payment and delivery schedule for the TOW ' s . At that meeting , the parties apparently discussed a nine-point U.S. agenda with Iran . Tht agenda included deivery by the U.S. of the 500 TOW ' s , an unspecified number of HAWK ' s , discussion of the 17 Da ' Wa prisoners held by Kuwait , additional arms including 1 , 000 more TOW ' s , and military intellience . In exchange the Iranians promised release of one and perhaps two U.S. citizens held hostage in Beirut and " further efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a meeting between representatives of the State Department and the second channel on December 13 , 1986 , the Iranian said that both sides had agreed to this nine-point agenda . The board found no evidence that LtCol North had authority to agree to such an agenda . Secretary Shultz told the board that he informed the President the next day . He said that the President was " stricken " and could not believe anything like this had been discussed . Of particular concern was the point that the United States had consistently given strong support to Kuwait in resisting terrorist demands for the release of the Da ' Wa prisoners. // At the October 26-28 meeting , the Iranian participants said the story of the McFarlane mission to Teheran had been published in a small Hezbollah newspaper in Baalbek , Lebanon . The article was based on a series of leaflets distributed in Tehran on 15 or 16 October. // Mr. Regan recalls the President authorizing the shipment of 500 TOW ' s on October 29 , 1986. // Because of a delay in the transfer of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 , 1986 , were Israeli TOW ' s . The 500 U.S. TOW ' s were provided to Israel as replacements on Novembr 7. // On November 2 , hostage David Jacobsen was released . The next day , a pro-Syrian Beirut magazine published the story of the McFarlane mission . On November 4 , Majlis Speaker Rafsanjani publicly announced the mission . <> <> CONTRA DIVERSION // Sizable sums of money generated by the arms sales to Iran remain unaccounted for . Determining whether the funds from the sale of arms to Iran were diverted to support the contras proved to be extremely difficult . VADM Poindexter , LtCol North , Israeli participants and other key witnesses refusd to appear before the board and records for relevant bank accounts maintained in Switzerland and elsewhere could not be obtained by the board . Notwithstanding , there was considerable evidence before the board of a diversion to support the contras . But the board had no hard proof. <> <> * * * <> <> A Diversion Was Suggested. // It is unclear who first suggested the idea of diverting funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evidence suggests that the idea surfaced early in 1986. // Attorney General Meese told the board that during his interview with LtCol North on November 23 , 1986 , North indicated that the idea surfaced during a discussion with Mr. Nir in January 1986 about ways Israel could help the contras . LtCol North recalled the Israeli official suggesting that the " residuals " from the Iran arms sales be transferred to the contras . Contemporaneous Justice Department notes of the November interview indicated that LtCol North said the diversion was an Israeli idea , that the Israelis wanted to be helpful. // Mr. Ghorbanifar told the board that he had a conversation with LtCol North and Mr. Secord sometime in February of 1986 concerning arrangements for the upcoming delivery of 1 , 000 TOW missiles to Iran . He said that LtCol North and Mr. Secord were extremely worried about a shortfall in funding for the contras . Mr. Ghorbanifar said that LtCol North asked him if the Iranians would pay $10 , 000 per TOW missile , instead of $6 , 500 . When told that Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greatly relieved - " he was a changed man. " // In a memorandum of a meeting with Mr. Ghorbanifar in Paris on March 7-8 , George Cave reported that Mr. Ghorbanifar , in an aside , " proposed that we use profits from these deals and others to fund support to the rebels in Afghanistan . We could do the same with Nicaragua. " // Before the board , Mr. Cave said that neither he nor Mr. Ghorbanifar made any mention of diversion . <> <> North and Poindexter Said Diversion Occurred // Attorney General Meese told the board that during his interview with LtCol North on November 23 , 1986 , North said that $3 to $4 million was diverted to the support of the contras after the February shipment of TOW missiles and that more ( though how much LtCol North was not sure ) was diverted after the May shipment of HAWK parts .

LtCol North prepared in early April an unsigned memorandum entitled " Release of American Hostages in Beirut , " which sought Presidential approval for what became Mr. McFarlane ' s May trip to Teheran . In that memo , LtCol North stated that $12 million in " residual " funds from the transaction would " be used to purchase critically needed supplies for the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance Forces . " No evidence has emerged to suggest that this memorandum was ever placed before VADM Poindexter , the President , or any other U.S. official. // As a general matter , LtCol North kept VADM Poindexter exhaustively informed about his activities with respect to the Iran initiative .

STAFF AND SUPPORT FOR THE CONTRAS // Inquiry into the arms sale to Iran and the possible diversion of funds to the contras disclosed evidence of substantial N.S.C. staff involvement in a related area : private support for the contras during the period that support from the U.S. Government was either banned or restricted by Congress. // There are similarities in the two cass . Indeed , the N.S.C. staff ' s role in support for the contras set the stage for its subsequent role in the Iran initiative .

He relied heavily on private U.S. citizens and foreigners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals were involved in both . When Israeli plans for the November HAWK shipment began to unravel , LtCol North turned to the private network that was already in place to run the contra support operation .

In neither case was Congress informed . In the case of contra support , Congress may have been actively misled. <> <> * * * // The Board had neither the time nor the resources to conduct a full inquiry into the role of the N.S.C. staff in the support of the contras that was commensurate with its work on the Iran arms sales . As a consequence , the evidence assembled by the board was somewhat anecdotal and disconnected . The most significant evidence is summarized in this Section C. A fuller treatment is contained in Appendix C. <> <> The Bid for Private Funding // Because of Congressional restrictions , the Executive Branch turned to private sources to sustain the contras militarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff repeatedly denied any direct involvement in efforts to obtain funds from these sources . Yet evidence before the board suggests that LtCol North was well aware of these efforts and played a role in coordinating them . The extent of that role remains unclear. // In a memorandum to Mr. McFarlane dated April 11 , 1985 , LtCol North expressed concern that remaining contra funds would soon be insufficient . He advised that efforts be made to seek $15 to $20 million in additional funds from the current donors which will " allow the force to grow to 30-35 , 000 . " The exact purpose to which these private funds were to be put was unambiguous . A number of memorandums from LtCol North make clear that the funds were for munitions and lethal aid. // Asked by the board about the source of such funds , Mr. McFarlane provided a written response that indicated that " without solicitation " a foreign official offered $1 million a month from what he described as " personal funds .

A diagram found in LtCol North ' s safe links some of these organizations to bank accounts controlled by Richard Secord and others known to be involved in purchasing and shipping arms to the contras. // Other documents and evidence suggest that private contributions for the contras were eventually funneled into " Project Democracy , " a term apparently used by LtCol North to describe a network of secret bank accounts and individuals involved in contra resupply and other activities . In a message to VADM Poindexter dated July 15 , 1986 , LtCol North described " Project Democracy " assets as worth over $4. 5 million . They included six aircraft , warehouses , supplies , maintenance facilities , ships , boats , leased houses , vehicles , ordnance , munitions , communications equipment and a 6 , 520-foot runway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rica .

LtCol North also noted that from July 1984 to April 9 , 1985 : " $17 , 145 , 594 has been expended for arms , munitions , combat operations and support activities. " // Evidence suggests that at least by November 1985 LtCol North had assumed a direct operational role , coordinating logistical arrangements to ship privately purchased arms to the contras . In a note to Poindexter on November 22 , 1985 , he described a prospective delivery as " our first direct flight of ammo to the resistance field in Nicaragua . " This shipment was delayed when Mr. Secord was asked to use the aircraft instead to deliver the 18 HAWK missiles to Iran in November 1985. // In 1986 , North established a private secure communications network .
