The sexual-textual revolution comes to Scripture <P> What is a human being that you are mindful of him , and a mortal that you care for him ? <P> <P> Sound familiar but somehow fiat ? The more famous rendering of Psalms 8 : 4 is rather more ringing : " What is man that thou art mindful of him , and the son of man that thou dost care for him ? " But Christians in the English-speaking world had better get used to the neutered wording , for it may appear in the new edition of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible due a decade from now . The reworked RSV will include hundreds of such language changes made in the cause of stripping Scripture of " sexism . " <P> The use of " inclusive language , " intended to put women on a textual par with men , has long since been accepted in many areas of U.S. publishing , such as school textbooks and children 's fables . But its application to the Bible is already stirring an unholy row . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated by a committee of 25 scholars and translators . Their efforts will have far-reaching importance . With millions of copies sold worldwide since it first appeared in 1952 , the RSV is by far the most broadly used Bible translation in modern English . <P> Precisely because of its influence , the RSV is now a target of Protestant feminists and other critics who want to purge it of the male chauvinism that they find running all through its pages . Says the Rev. Jeanne Audrey Powers , a United Methodist mission official : " People are becoming increasingly sensitive to language that renders half the human race invisible . " As it happens , such sentiment is strong in the National Council of Churches ( N.C.C. ) , whose education division is overseeing the RSV revision . But the N.C.C .

The RSV has been a success largely because of its preservation of much of the evocative language of its antecedent , the King James Bible of 1611 .

" <P> The man in charge of the RSV revision is the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger , 66 , a gentlemanly New Testament professor at Princeton Theological Seminary . While Metzger is conservative on matters of doc trine , he is willing to avoid male nouns and pronouns-where the original Hebrew and Greek texts allow it . Thus the reference in Romans 14 : 1 to " the man who is weak in faith " will likely become " the one who is weak . . . " In Psalms , the first verse will read " Blessed are those who walk not in the counsel of the wicked , " rather than " Blessed is the man who walks not . . . " In Psalms alone , more than 200 male pronouns will be dropped . <P> Even these limited word changes are too much for many traditionalists , among them the Rev. E.
