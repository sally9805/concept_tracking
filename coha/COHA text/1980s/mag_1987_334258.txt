The 55 dedicated men who gathered in Philadelphia in the spring and summer of 1787 could hardly have imagined that their handiwork would one day be feted in such fashion . " We the people of the United States , " they wrote after much heated debate , " in order to form a more perfect union . . . and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and to our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . " <P> Now Posterity is gearing up for the 200th anniversary celebration of the historic document the Founding Fathers produced . Like last year 's extravaganza for the Statue of Liberty , the Constitution 's bicentennial will offer a jarring contrast between high purpose and pure kitsch . True , the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution , headed by former Chief Justice Warren Burger , has rejected some of the more outrageous proposals . As a result , there will be no bicentennial brownie or constitutional hot dog . The commission has nevertheless designed a circular logo  --  enclosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words " We the People "  --  to be emblazoned on golf shirts , caps , scarves and sweatshirts . <P> In Philadelphia , whose city fathers hope to attract millions of tourists for the Constitution celebrations , a local planning committee called We the People 200 intends to license mementos including T shirts and reproductions of the pen used by the signers in 1787 . Still , the group insists commercialism will be kept to a minimum . " We 're not looking to junk it up , " says Executive Director of Programming Fred Stein . " We do n't have an official toilet seat , nor will we . " <P> Corporate sponsors and celebrities have been slow to jump on the bandwagon . Former President Gerald Ford is still considering an offer to be the guest of honor , and the Supreme Court rejected the idea of holding a session in Philadelphia during the celebration . To date , television network coverage of the eight-to-ten hours of Philadelphia festivities is still being negotiated . But the planners are certain their program will sell . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Richard Rovsek , the committee 's national marketing director . <P> Unofficial entrepreneurs have joined in the fun . Says Columbia University Sociologist Herbert Gans : " When there 's a national festival , the hucksters are there . That 's nothing new . " Pens , place mats , puzzles , ashtrays , comic books and even thermometers will carry a constitutional motif . Hilton Hotels will place copies of the Constitution along with Gideon Bibles in each room . For Saturday-morning viewing , ABC Television has produced a series of Constitution Bicentennial Minutes , featuring Bugs Bunny and friends . <P> The celebrations will range from the scholarly to the silly . " Harmless history lessons " is how Stein describes We the People 's program . In September Philadelphia will stage a re-enactment of the signing of the Constitution , with celebrities ( still unnamed ) playing the parts of the more prominent signers : George Washington , James Madison , Benjamin Franklin . The city will also re-create in its streets the grand parade that followed the original signing , " updated , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Peter Max.
