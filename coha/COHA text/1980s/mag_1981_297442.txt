A plea of insanity , a cry for love <P> By any standard of common sense , it was an insane act : shooting a President to win the affections of a movie star . The legal definition of madness , however , is a bit more exacting ( see LAW ) . Last week lawyers for John Hinckley , 26 , the man who wounded President Reagan and three others on March 30 outside the Washington Hilton Hotel , declared in a court brief that they will argue Hinckley 's innocence by reason of insanity . In a case where the facts of the crime are so starkly clear-the defense admits to the shooting-an insanity plea may be Hinckley 's only chance for acquittal . <P> As if to demonstrate the slippery grip on reality his lawyers will claim for him , Hinckley has written a letter to TIME Washington Correspondent Evan Thomas elaborating on his one-sided courtship of Actress Jodie Foster , 18 ( see box ) . Hinckley had written TIME several weeks earlier offering to answer any 20 questions the magazine posed . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his travels before the shooting and his friends-but Hinckley chose to address only his feelings about Foster . Atop the letter , Hinckley scrawled the title , The Lovesick Assassin . <P> In preliminary documents submitted to Federal District Court Judge Barrington Parker , Hinckley 's attorneys asked that their client 's case be heard by two separate juries , one to make the pro forma determination that Hinckley did indeed shoot Reagan , the other to make the critical judgment about his sanity . Hinckley 's lawyers fear that once jurors see videotapes of the shooting and hear exhaustive FBI testimony about Hinckley 's elaborate transcontinental drifting in the months that preceded the act , they would be incapable of reaching a verdict dispassionately on the question of his mental state . " Understandably , " the attorneys contend in their brief , " there will be great rage and anger directed at Mr. Hinckley . " The best guess of lawyers familiar with the case is that Judge Parker will rule in favor of a conventional , single-jury trial . <P> That proceeding will not begin before December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely require that Hinckley 's lawyers-members of the high-powered Washington firm of Williams and Connolly , home of Superlawyer Edward Bennett Williams-introduce as evidence every token of his preoccupation with Foster . A new addition to that curious lore surfaced last week , when authorities leaked a transcript of tape recordings , made by Hinckley last winter , of two telephone conversations he had with Foster . The calls , to the actress 's Yale University dormitory in New Haven , were not acknowledged by her until last week . Says Foster : " It 's not anything I can talk about . "
