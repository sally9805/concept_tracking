Amid this welter of retrospectivity is one event that is very much in the present tense , a naturalization ceremony for a hundred new Americans tomorrow at 3 P.M. at the Unisphere , an outsize souvenir of the 1964-65 fair , which adjoins the growing Asian community that has imparted an exciting look and energy to the old and historic town of Flushing . This weekend , remembrance and renewal are but one subway station apart , the former at Shea Stadium , the latter at Main Street , end of the line. // Because both World ' s Fairs opened at this time of year , the urge to memorialize is irrepressible . The events tomorrow from noon to 5 P.M. and Sunday from noon to 4 : 30 P.M. under the aegis of the Queens Museum will be held , mostly , in the museum ' s home , which was the New York City Building in the 1939-40 fair . One of the more unusual programs , however , will be held in the Great Hall of the New York Hall of Science , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. , various people who participated in the making of the fair will be heard from , among them an architect , a composer of a theme song and creators of the wonderful Panorama of New York City that is now part of the museum. // There are other nostalgia-joggers for fair fans , but they are in Manhattan . There is an exhibition of rare mementos of the 1939-40 exposition at the New-York Historical Society , 170 Central Park West , at 77th Street ( 873-3400 ) . The debut of a large-size colorful book , " Trylon and Perisphere : The 1939 World ' s Fair , " has been coordinated with the start this weekend of an exhibition at Jack Gallery , 138 Prince Street ( 226-1989 ) , in SoHo. // Because those two fairs were dedicated to speculating on the world of tomorrow , a visit to Flushing itself is exciting because it symbolizes an international world of today . What fairgoers from China , Korea or India could have imagined that this Flushing - settled by religious refugees fleeing from the tyranny of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their countrymen ? // Flushing nowadays is a virtual world ' s fair of its own , a kaleidoscope of scenes , as though a collection of backdrops had somehow been inexplicably brought to the same stage . On the one hand , there are reminders of the first settlers and of later ones whose homes and stores gave Flushing the look of a small self-contained town . On the other , the new look of East Asia offers the visitor streets filled with restaurants serving delicacies that the gourmet once bought travel tickets to find. // The excitement of discovery in Flushing lies in the first view of the Hindu Temple of North America , where worshipers pay homage to their gods in a neighborhood where an early American Quaker went to prison to establish religious freedom in this country . One ' s senses will quicken to the action in a Chinese supermarket , an Indian sari shop , a Korean bakery , a Japanese grocery. // The throbbing new Asian life pulsating through the once somnolent streets of Flushing has been a mixed blessing . Old residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business space will put historic real estate at risk . Yet , some Flushing-born residents see the new waves as a continuation of the place ' s important role in the development of American religious freedom . " The roots of Asian settlement may go back to the World ' s Fair , when workers looked for places to live near it , " said Jack Eichenbaum , an urban geographer who also leads tours in Queens and lives in central Flushing . " That was followed by changes in immigration law and , by the 70 ' s the big change in population here . This is the second largest area of Korean settlement , after Los Angeles , in the United States and the second largest Chinese neighborhood in New York . We have Indian temples and mosques and a Shinto shrine . We also have one of the oldest continuous black congregations in New York . I call it the center of hybridization , following the tradition of religious freedom that began 300 years ago .

The society , at 143-35 37th Avenue ( 718-939-0647 ) , issues a " Flushing Freedom Mile Historic Tour " brochure ( in English , Chinese and Korean ) that guides one through the remaining profile of earliest Flushing , most of it within a block or two of Northern Boulevard , between Main Street and Parsons Boulevard. // In fact , to find the many enclaves of Flushing , a start can be made at the Queens Historical Society at Kingsland . Kingsland is a farmhouse , moved to this 37th Avenue site from a mile and a half away , and it is a truly rural sight , contrasting with the big apartment houses and noisy traffic of nearby Parsons Boulevard . One room is furnished in Victorian style , while the downstairs is an exhibition space , now featuring a show with the self-explanatory title " Bottles .

Flushing was founded in 1645 by refugees from Puritan Boston who came to New Amsterdam to enjoy the relatively greater Dutch tolerance . In 1661 , John Bowne , an Englishman who became a Quaker , built this house , where the Quakers held meetings and were prosecuted for this by Peter Stuyvesant .

The house also has pleasant garden spaces . Open Tuesdays , Saturdays and Sundays from 2 : 30 to 4 : 30 P.M. Admission : $2 ; 12 ' s and under , 50 cents. // Just across the way and a little toward Northern Boulevard , in front of 36-40 Bowne Street , is a historical marker , the George Fox Stone , a dark rough-cut slab bearing the inscription : " Here stood Fox Oaks beneath whose branches George Fox , founder of the Society of Friends , preached , June 7 , 1672 . " <> <> West to Go East // Walk west on 37th Street to Union Street and there is a hemispheric change . Signs are in distinctive Korean writing , little squares and circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Boulevard. // " When I came here 12 years ago , there were about 5 , 000 Koreans and the business was mainly for Japanese residents , the business people who lived in Queens while they stayed in the United States , " recalled John Hong , a Flushing real estate agent , who said that there were now 10 Korean restaurants. // Union Street is almost all Korean . Kim Hak Kwon ' s restaurant , Kim Sas Kak , is at 38-13 Union Street ( 718-445-1165 ) , and he says it was the first in the neighborhood when he opened it six years ago , after landing in New York three years earlier from Seoul. // The only Western-alphabet word spells " Paris " at 36-40 Union Street ( 718-461-5741 ) , where the Park bakery , with a counter in front and tables in the rear , has on sale herbal tea , Korean white bread and mochi cakes filled with red bean paste , potatoes , carrots and similar things attractive to the Korean taste , which does not like its desserts too sweet. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life are cheek by jowl at 36-24 Union Street . Here is the all-Korean religious articles store Bethel Christian Books and Gifts ( 718-461-1288 ) , where customers were picking their way through books and festive red wall-hangings that combined Christian themes with traditional Korean motifs . Next door , is Mr. Bae Golf , a sports shop at 34-24A ( 718-461-4765 ) , where the window is filled with clubs and trophies . Golf is as popular with Koreans as it is with Japanese , or even Americans. // At the head of Union Street , one door down from Northern Boulevard , is the Main Street Grocery , named for its original location 20 years ago when it was one of the first Asian enterprises in Flushing . Tetsuro Takada , controller of the business and the son of its Japanese founder , said that the company has expanded , with stores in White Plains ; Fort Lee , N.J. ; Atlanta , and Houston , " This store is more general than the others , " Mr. Takada said . " This is a neighborhood that ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Koreans as well as for Japanese. " // Among items in the Chinese food section were boxes of Smart Fortune Cookies . In the store , one can buy shrimp , rice , tofu , sukiyaki beef and various fish. // A left turn on Northern Boulevard leaves Korea behind as abruptly as though the corner were an international border . On the boulevard ' s broad center strip are memorials to war veterans and to Daniel Carter Beard , a Flushing artist and naturalist who was one of the founders of the Boy Scouts. // On the south side of the boulevard , past the turreted New York State National Guard Armory , is the Friends Meeting House ( 718-358-9636 ) , Flushing ' s first house of worship , and the city ' s oldest , begun in 1694 . This landmark ' s outside retains its pristine look and services are still held amid the hand-hewn oak beams and timbers from a dismantled sailing ship that went into its construction . <> <> Transplanted Taiwan // Almost next door , Flushing ' s Chinese presence looms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 718-445-7007 ) . The center features a large reading room with newspapers and magazines , in Chinese , for visitors. // Jusiang Chien , a member of the center , said it was three years old and the first and still only center in North America for Taiwanese. // Exactly next door to the Taiwan Center is the Stony Wok Restaurant , 137-40 Northern Boulevard ( 718-445-8535 ) , a typically Taiwanese restaurant , with built-in stoves at the tables on which one may cook one ' s own food to taste . Stony Wok ' s specialty is the Taiwanese hot pot , a sort of Chinese fondue in which the diner plunges pork , beef , shrimp , vegetables - dozens of edibles - into the bubbling brew in a large container on the table. // " The Chinese name of the restaurant is Hua Xiang , Flowery Native , " a manager said . " That reminds people of Taiwan . We are open from 11 : 30 A.M. to 3 A.M. , so we cater to other restaurant people after their places have closed. " // Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure that looks as though it had come from a Bavarian fairy tale . Town Hall was built in 1862 and was a center of Flushing life when the town was its own entity . Now it is , sadly , unused and showing signs of decay while decisions are awaited on its future. // A left turn from Northern Boulevard at Main Street takes the stroller into a busy shopping thoroughfare that is generic , not ethnic . But in sidestreets , the Chinese motif prevails. // Back at Main Street , at 38th Avenue , is St. George ' s Church ( 718-359-1171 ) , a stately Gothic Revival building , with churchyard , that was built in 1854 , the third on the site since 1746 . Among the early leaders in the Episcopalian congregation of the splendidly aloof landmark were Francis Lewis , a signer of the Declaration of Independence , and Samuel Seabury , the first Episcopal bishop in America , who served as rector from 1757 to 1765 . Prominent members of the congregation and clergy are memorialized in unusual stained-glass windows , while names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens streets , among them Willett , Pople , Van Wyck . At the church ' s rear is an enormous magnolia tree , nearly 150 years old , with a double trunk that spreads serenely over the quiet yard . It is open to the public Sunday mornings . A parishioner recalled that in 1956 , the neighborhood , now gone to concrete , " was all big trees. " // Virtually out the back door of the church , at 37-17A Prince Street , is the Golden Pond Seafood Restaurant ( 718-886-1628 ) , where on weekend evenings customers wait on the street for tables in the ornate , Hong Kong Cantonese interior. // Ambiance becomes total environment a short walk away , on the Roosevelt Avenue block west of Main Street reaching to Prince Street . It is as Chinese as Union Street is Korean . On a Saturday , the food markets in the block are jammed with customers for mushrooms , seafood and the omnipresent bags of rice .

The doughy breadsticks called youtiao are particularly popular , both for take out at the bakery counter and at the tables . Vegetarian House , a new establishment at No. 135-42 ( 718-353-1166 ) , attracts non-Chinese , too , with meatless menus . <> <> Manhattan Emigres // One block to the south - along 40th Road , leading off of Main Street - is less flamboyant in announcing its leanings , but there are in it a half-dozen Chinese restaurants and associated establishments . Fred Lin Sye and his wife , Laura May , came from Shantung , by way of Taiwan , and by 1981 , scenting new opportunities in Flushing , they moved their Happy Dumpling Restaurant into 135-29 40th Road ( 718-445-2163 ) . // " I like it here , " Mr. Sye said . " The competition is hard . You have to be good . There are 4 Chinese fish markets around , and 20 restaurants , maybe , with 7 on this block . Our specialty is dumplings and casseroles , like fish-head casseroles. " // A door or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 718-886-2011 ) also has a specialty , one that is rare in quantity in other restaurants. // " Flour is our specialty , " said He Yun , one of the management figures , speaking in Chinese . " I come from Beijing and the boss and I like that kind of cooking , so when we opened here three years ago , we made this the specialty on the general menu . Our cook comes from Beijing too . " Among the dozen specialties are baked sesame hard cake Beijing style , stuffed baked sesame hard cake , pan-fried leek ravioli Beijing style , steamed vegetable bun , silver thread bun , and crispy pan-fried scallion crepe. // At block ' s end is a vestige of old Flushing , the Old Roma Restaurant , at 135-11 40th Road ( 718-359-9453 ) , a gracious Italian establishment that has long been a favorite of knowledgeable Continental gourmets in Queens . <> <> Passage to India // From here , the path is south along Main Street , past the busy Queens Borough Public Library , where Asians and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of a hit show . Several blocks south - at Franklin Street - Main Street , on its eastern side , takes on the coloration of an Indian bazaar . Between Franklin and Blossom Streets , perhaps 10 establishments sell groceries and clothing of Indian interest and almost all stock videotapes of Indian movies and music videos. // " Most of the Indian people here are from cities , " said Madhulika Shankar of the Asian/American Center at Queens College . " On the whole , they know English , are more sophisticated and are almost exclusively professional people , although store owners have started appearing here. " // At the prosaic-looking Ganesh Groceries , 42-75 Main Street ( 718-961-9311 ) , the floor is dominated by sacks of chapati flour , " nothing added , " while on the side are beans and spices of what used to be called here the exotic East : dal , Madras curry powder , samber powder , coriander. // The colorfully bedecked window of Japan Sari House , 42-73 Main Street ( 718-886-0457 ) , has every cut of sari imaginable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , is based on the fact that the Indian gowns are made of Japanese material. // At Dana Bazaar , 42-69 Main Street ( 718-353-2818 ) , the " House of Shamiana Sweets , " the pastries sold at the counter , ready to eat , include ladoo dumplings and rasmalaz ( a milk-based cake ) . // There is a sort of balance in ending this Flushing tour on a spiritual note , in keeping with the tone of its beginning . About a half-mile from this Indian enclave on Main Street is another , centered on Bowne and Holly Streets . This is where one of the city ' s most unusual spectacles is offered , in the shape of the Hindu Temple of North America , 45-57 Bowne Street ( 718-539-1587 ) . It is dedicated to Lord Ganesha , who has an elephant ' s head and is a remover of obstacles , a giver of wisdom. // The temple looms over small homes on a nondescript street . This impressive presence , finished in 1977 , was built of 50 tons of gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in Italy , according to Ram Chandran , the executive director of the Hindu Temple Society of North America . Its rectangular tower is elaborately sculptured , with figures on the lower levels supporting the higher levels . A stone canopy is held up by two sculptured columns that rest upon two stone elephants that form bannisters for the entry steps. // Inside , a spacious room is spectacularly adorned by fabrics , hangings , red carpets on the floors of local marble and altars , and the very special ornamented icons before which congregants worship , with the help of bare-chested clerics . Occasionally , a bell sounds and food is blessed . Mr. Chandran explained that the icons were made of 20 tons of granite brought , pre-fabricated , from India ' s Andra Pradesh region . On a weekend , visitors are welcome to look on , if they wish , at this scene of deep religious devotion. // And so , this tour of Flushing ends , with the clanging of temple bells. //             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
