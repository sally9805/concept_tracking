They were wrong about San Sebastian . Things were not normal in this Basque capital . They were quiet . Such tranquillity seemingly requires a strong - and precarious - act of will in Euzkadi , the name given to the three Basque provinces that have recently won a limited regional government . In the last few days an unusual combination of Basque voices has been calling for quiet and urging what Carlos Goiecochea , a leader of the Basque Nationalist Party and the head of the Euzkadi government , described as the act of " keeping our feet on the ground. " // // A Uniting Factor : Fear // The voices ranged from the moderate nationalists to the Socialists and Communists and to one of the two political groupings that have grown up around the E.T.A. guerrillas . They were united by fear . There is nervousness throughout Spain about the implications of the brief military seizure of Parliament , but in the Basque country there is a good deal more : a painful test of the region ' s native predilection to work for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy. // If there is one chief factor that aggravates the difficult task of getting Spain ' s armed forces to accept the disorders of democracy , it is the armed fight by E.T.A. The guerrillas have been steadily killing over the last half-dozen years , and a great many of the victims have been members of the Civil Guard. // The Spanish military concedes that one of its central missions is to preserve the unity of Spain . It is highly suspicious of the autonomous arrangements reached with Catalonia and the Basque provinces . In the case of the Basques , the military ' s unhappiness has turned to outrage by the toll of dead Civil Guardsmen . <> <> ' Now You Know ' // A Basque deputy recalled today that at one point during the occupation of the Parliament , a Civil Guard officer had said : " Our men are being shot in the back in Euzkadi . Now you know what it feels like. " // The attempted coup in Madrid has strengthened an argument that most of the political groups in the Basque region were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while useful under Franco , have become undesirable under a political system in which the central Government is both democratic and willing to offer a measure of autonomy. // A continuation of the violence , the argument goes , will mean one of two things , both undesirable : either the civilian Government in Madrid will take harsh mililtary action in the Basque country or a new dictatorship will do so. // E.T.A. is divided into two factions . Both are , obviously , illegal , but each is linked to a legal political group . One is Euskadiko Ezkerra , and the other is Herri Batasuna . <> <> Euskadiko in Dispute With E.T.A. // The leaders of Euskadiko have adopted for some time , and with increasing conviction , the proposition that violence is no longer appropriate . The E.T.A group linked to them , on the other hand , recently kidnapped three honorary consuls in San Sebastian and is still holding them . The kidnapping was in response to the death by police torture of an E.T.A. member , Jose Luis Arregui . Juan Bandres , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned the kidnapping and expected to persuade E.T.A. to release the captives shortly. // Herri , which is larger , pursues a line of no compromise , and the E.T.A. groups linked to it show no signs of halting the violence . Herri takes the position , publicly at least , that it is a matter of indifference whether the Madrid Government is democratic or not . As long as its demands for full amnesty and a large autonomy are rejected , it says , the fight must continue. // Herri has only about half the electoral strength of the moderate Nationalist Party . But along with E.T.A. it manages to hold on to one part of the divided Basque soul - the part that rejects the rest of Spain outright and compensates for the impracticality of that notion by brandishing the warrior legend. // The Nationalists increasingly , and now the Euskadiko as well , hold the other part , which accepts that for the forseeable future the Basque country will be linked to Spain and that a democratic Madrid Government can be negotiated with . <> <> ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable schizophrenia . When E.T.A. commits some particularly repugnant bit of violence - the recent murder , for example , of a supervisor at a nuclear plant - feelings swing against it and Herri . " But , " one moderate politician said , " we can always be sure that Madrid will do something grotesque that will give Herri another boost. " // The killing of the nuclear supervisor is generally regarded as a decisive mistake . It produced one of the biggest anti-E . T.A. demonstrations ever seen . Within days , however , with what Mr. Bandres called " the evil luck that hangs over this country , " Mr. Arregui ' s torture and death were disclosed . Another demonstration took place , and Herri and the E.T.A. recovered at least some ground. // Whether the warning signal provided by Monday ' s putsch will swing the public mood here decisively enough to influence E.T.A. and Herri remains to be seen . In any event , the quiet that has prevailed this week is due to end tomorrow. // In reply to the decision by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of democracy - but avoiding any criticism of the armed forces - Herri is organizing a rival demonstration of its own . It is expected to carry posters violently attacking the military ; the police are under orders to seize any such posters. // The probable street confrontation does not seriously worry the political forces that are struggling to preserve the gains of the last five years . " But when will the next Civil Guard be shot ? " one politician asked today. //
