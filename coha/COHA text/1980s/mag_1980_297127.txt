LONELY ON THE MOUNTAIN by Louis L'Amour ; Bantam ; $2.25 ; paperbound <P> Dwight Eisenhower passed on his dogeared copies to Secret Service men ; former Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman is an avid fan ; so is Ronald Reagan 's campaign press secretary , Lyn Nofziger . Tom Landry packs a volume with his Dallas Cowboys playbook for road trips ; Country Star Willie Nelson has a coveted signed edition . Straight through the heartland of America , truck drivers pass up the centerfold magazines at diesel stops to buy a copy of his latest paperback ; thousands of folks from Santa Fe , N. Mex. , to Savannah , Ga. , line up for his autograph on his frequent tours . <P> Louis Dearborn L'Amour may be the most famous obscure author in America . He hardly ever makes the bestseller lists , nor is he yet a darling of the literati , like Mystery Writer John D. MacDonald . But today over 100 million copies of his frontier and western novels are in print . Moreover , he and his publishers have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 77 volumes , Lonely on the Mountain , is the 16th episode of the long and winding Sackett saga , tracing the fortunes of a frontier family from the 17th century up to the 1890s . <P> L'Amour has also written a dozen volumes about the Chantrys and the Talons , two other hard-riding families linked to the Sacketts by marriage . The latest L'Amour western omelet is highly seasoned and full of natural ingredients : the proud , individualistic Sackett brothers , Tell , Orrin and Tyrel , drive a herd from Colorado to Canada , answering an urgent call for help from Cousin Logan . On the winding trail they deal with Indians ( mostly good ) , women ( aggressively virtuous ) , rustlers ( as mean as copperheads ) , plus a menagerie of grizzlies , wolves , giant mosquitoes and the customary herd of bison . In addition , there are two elaborate fistfights and a six-shot denouement . <P> Narrator Tell Sackett is illiterate and speaks with a clanking formality that sounds like John Wayne 's movie lines ( " It is a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those who come with idle hands " ) . The Duke , in fact , played the title role in Hondo , from the novel of the same name , one of more than 30 L'Amour books bought for the screen . <P> L'Amour heroes like Tell do n't chew , swear , swill redeye or hang around dance halls , and they do n't go with girls who do . Horseplay and gunplay are surprisingly infrequent . The Sacketts are courtly coffee drinkers who never draw first and fight only when their bedrock belief in the perfectability of mankind has been violated . They hardly rate a PG . <P> However , they have little time to be anything but virtuous . Up in the mountains or over on the butte , the cowpokes constantly deal with hunger , flood , stampedes and illness . Their trials are immediate and personal , and in overcoming them they create a kind of cactus morality play that readers want to see repeated .                   @ @
