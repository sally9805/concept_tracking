 | Fragonard is the master of instant gratification . Pleasure is never postponed in his canvases , where fat , rosy babies or peach-skinned girls are caught by his brush in the midst of a romp , luxuriating in foamy waters or rumpled bedclothes . Grown-ups in sun-dappled Fragonard land disport themselves at child 's play , in games of blindman 's buff . The artist is said to have kept a swing in his studio to paint models in a favorite pose . Of all the erotic images to emerge from the randy 18th century , few offer as fetching a come-on as the young lady on " The Swing , " his famous picture in the Wallace Collection in London . She is shown kicking off a dainty shoe in midair , while her suitor , crouched in the bushes below her , looks up her billowing skirts . When most people think of Fragonard , they think of this frivolous world , a last burst of rococo exuberance before the fall of the guillotine . But those subjects ? charm- ing and witty as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter 's enduring appeal . The landmark Fragonard exhibition now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , which includes more than 200 works ( unfortunately , " The Swing " is not among them ) , shows an underlying sensibility that is distinctly modern . As Pierre Rosenberg , chief curator at the Louvre in Paris , indicates in the splendid , weighty catalog ( 635 pages . Distributed by Harry N. Abrams. $45 ) , Fragonard 's real subject was painting itself . With his extraordinary use of the effects of light ? in golden pools or diffused glows ? he foreshadowed the impressionists by 100 years . His quick , bold handling of paint ? which made some of his work look unfinished to his contemporaries ? has the vitality of action painting . Jean Honore Fragonard ( 1732-1806 ) grew up in an art world tyrannized by fashion and formal rules . Though he studied under Boucher and Chardin , he did n't have the advantage of classical training at the official Academy . He was modest , cheerful ? and a little insecure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy to study , he was so awed by the Michelangelos and Raphaels that for months he could barely draw a line . But he recovered his nerve and in Tivoli and elsewhere produced a series of brilliant landscape sketches that almost seem to shimmer on the page . Back in Paris , Fragonard ignored the politics of the art world . He did n't go to the right parties or hobnob with all the Academicians . Though he was admitted to the Academy as an associate , he never bothered to submit a final history painting in order to become a full member . Nor did he especially care about royal commissions ? Louis XV was far too slow in paying his bills . Instead , Fragonard painted decorations , landscapes and boudoir scenes for rich private collectors . " Les Debuts du modele , " in which a mother promotes the nubile charms of her daughter to an artist , is the sort of witty , anecdotal picture that his clients loved . But critics thought Fragonard at times squandered his gifts . At the Salon of 1767 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a sly parody of baroque decoration with mounds of pink babies , tangled and squishing each other , ascending among pale , cottony clouds . Diderot , for one , was not amused . " It is a nice big omelet of children in the sky , " he sniffed . " M. Fragonard , this is incredibly insipid . " Dutch landscapes : But often his interests ranged beyond the facile and lighthearted . He painted a series of canvases based on 17th-century Dutch landscapes , especially those of Ruisdael . ( He seems to have admired everything about Dutch landscapes except their barrenness ? a dealer advertising a Ruisdael for sale in 1786 noted that it had been " improved " by M. Fragonard , who added three figures and a cow . ) Another of his experiments were the " figures de fantaisie . " Fragonard used his sitters not to paint true likenesses but to demonstrate his virtuosity in capturing an impression boldly and quickly . He boasted that he could paint such a canvas in an @#  | hour . In the " Abbe de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and face aglow , the artist 's loose , dashing brushstrokes are used to high dramatic effect . The Abbe 's doublet is brilliant blue and the swath of his red-and-black cloak cuts across the form as if blown by the wind . Game of chance : Fragonard 's masterpieces are his grand pastoral scenes , descended from the elegant tradition of Watteau 's fetes galantes . They are among the works that prefigure the impressionists with the subtle play of light ? a dazzling technique the artist called " the pistol shot " of chiaroscuro , according to critic Dore Ashton in her new book on Fragonard . In the magnificent " La Fete a Saint-Cloud , " the viewer is transported into a balmy day in the park , where strollers stop to watch a marionette show or play a game of chance . Like most corners of Fragonard 's world , it is full of children and mothers and lovers ? a place , as many have remarked , where no one grows old or sick , turns angry or ugly . And though nature has been cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate man and dwarf him . By the time Fragonard painted this picture , about 1780 , it was already out of fashion . The first warning sign had come around 1772 , when Madame du Barry , mistress to Louis XV , rejected a series of panels she had commissioned for a new pavilion at her chateau at Louveciennes . The four large paintings , known as " The Progress of Love " and now installed at the Frick Collection in New York , are among the most beautiful Fragonard ever painted . Four moments in a couple 's romance are set in a most enchanted garden of lush , deep bluegreen foliage and bursting flowers . Though no one knows for certain , Madame du Barry probably rejected them as too passe for her stylishly neoclassical pavilion . Fragonard survived the revolution and was named an official of the new national museum of the Louvre . But he stopped painting . His art had become such an anachronism that his death a few years later attracted little notice . How deliciously ironic he might find it that the magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible to the modern eye and that the neoclassical panels with which Madame du Barry replaced his work have long been forgotten . @#
