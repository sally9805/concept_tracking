It was a beguiling fantasy . After two decades of disorder , the Democrats finally thought they had invented a system that would create an all-but- certain nominee after the 20 state primaries on March 8 , which will choose more than 30% of the convention delegates . Super Tuesday seemed perfect for a bandwagon bonanza : the winner would roar out of the South with enough momentum to coast to the nomination . Finally , the party would anoint its standard- bearer early enough and end the intraparty bloodletting soon enough so that he might carry something other than his home state and the District of Columbia come November . No more byzantine delegate arithmetic , no more bitter fights to the California primary , just a front-loaded primary calendar designed to produce a nominee who would be , at last , up for the ' 80s . <P> What fools these mortals be when they try to tinker with the Democratic Party 's natural affinity for chaos . Instead of providing clarity , the split verdicts from Iowa and New Hampshire have left four strong Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly one-quarter of the March 8 delegate harvest . Michael Dukakis , who scored a firm but not flashy 36% New Hampshire victory , heads into the unfamiliar terrain of Dixie as the leading white liberal in the race . Jesse Jackson , of course , should corral almost all the black vote . By finishing second in New Hampshire , with 20% , Richard Gephardt demonstrated that his nativist trade policies and his fiery mock-populist rhetoric resonate with blue-collar voters across the geographic spectrum . And Albert Gore , the not-ready-for-North ern-climes candidate , must prove that his Southern endorsements and smart-set moderate appeal can translate into primary votes . <P> After New Hampshire , the Democratic contest remains a tangled wrangle . The current consensus of party professionals is that no candidate is likely to win a delegate majority before the primary and caucus season ends in June . But that does not necessarily mean a modern-day version of a brokered convention , where a cabal of Democratic leaders finally gather under NO SMOKING signs to award the nomination to Mario Cuomo . <P> Far more probable is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public preconvention bargaining process in which the surviving candidates feverishly try to assemble a majority by negotiating with blocs of unpledged or loosely committed delegates . It is politics on the model of a Middle Eastern suq , where almost anything is possible if the price is right . <P> Farfetched ? With just 185 committed delegates selected by this week , it might seem implausible that insiders are already concocting deadlock scenarios . But the delegate arithmetic is as compelling as it is complex . Dust off the pocket calculator and hang on for the next two paragraphs . The climb may be a bit arduous , but the panoramic view of Democratic disarray is worth it . Remember , the goal is to win a 2,081-delegate majority .
