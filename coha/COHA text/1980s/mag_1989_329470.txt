Iran has often charged Saudi Arabia with failing to protect the sacred sites of Islam . But when Iranian visitors staged riots during the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in 1987 , Saudi security forces did not hesitate before attempting to quell the disturbances . More than 400 people , most of them Iranians , died during the violent clashes , leading to a break in diplomatic relations between the two countries the following year . Last week the Saudis demonstrated their resolve to punish disrupters of the hajj . In the largest public execution in recent years , swordsmen in Mecca publicly beheaded 16 Kuwaiti citizens for detonating bombs in Mecca last July . <P> The bombings , which killed one Pakistani pilgrim , may also have had an Iranian connection . Saudi television broadcast what it said was the confession of the ringleader , Mansour Hassan Abdullah Mehmeid , 32 . He and some of his accomplices had received Iranian training , said Mehmeid , and " collected the explosives from the back door of the Iranian embassy in Kuwait . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
