Every year at NCAA tournament time , one team seems to step out of a fairy tale and into reality . This year it is Providence . As in divine . The Friars , the Southeast Regional 's sixth seed , defeated No. 2 Alabama 103-82 and No. 1 Georgetown 88-73 at Louisville 's Freedom Hall last week to advance to the Final Four . This is the very same Providence that finished fourth in the Big East 's three-team horse race , the Providence led by a point guard , Billy Donovan , who looks like a cross between Beaver and Wally Cleaver . That 's why the Friars qualify as this year 's  --  pardon the expression  --  Cinderella . Because underneath all the soot , despite the harsh times and unglamorous appearances , Cinderella had a beauty not to be denied and a strength forged in the fires of adversity . In Providence 's case adversity was an eternitylike 40 minutes against the hard-rock Hoyas of Georgetown. // If you need statistics to gauge Saturday 's final , look at two . The first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 " New York City policeman 's son who was almost redshirted this season . He put the Hoyas in a straitjacket with 20 points , including 4 for 4 from three-point land , henceforth known as the Friar patch . The other notable stat would be Reggie Williams 's 29 minutes . In the 11 minutes the foul-strapped senior All-America was off the floor , Georgetown 's young wanna-be 's were out-scored 25-12 . After Reggie got his third foul on a reach-in with 3:56 left in the first half , Providence stretched a 39-33 advantage to a halftime lead of 54-37. // Georgetown had come back from deficits of five points or more in three previous NCAA games  --  it trailed Ohio State by 15 in the second half  --  purely on its will to work , its wearing down of the opposition and that one magnificent player . So this game would not be decided simply by how well Wright shot , or how long Reggie sat . No , the key to Providence 's win was its coach , Rick Pitino. // See him now in victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fitful sleep , drained and for the moment , happy . Surrounded by the celebration , he can escape real life a little longer . It is well known by now that Pitino 's six-month-old son , Daniel , died just before the tournament began . On Saturday afternoon Pitino could watch his players rejoicing , 10 feet tall , snipping the victory cords one by one . His players had comforted him in their own way . // Snip . First there 's Donovan , the regional 's MVP , who had followed Pitino 's directions flawlessly . Against power-packed Alabama , Providence hit 14 of 22 from the Friar patch while the SEC champions oohed and aahed with the rest of the crowd . All season Providence lived by the home run ball . " Pitino embraced it , " former Friar and NBA sharpshooter Joey Hassett said , looking on . " He wants them to shoot it . When you 're a shooter who knows the coach wants you to shoot ... " you thrive . // Pitino knew that Hoya coach John Thompson would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan , Delray Brooks and Ernie ( Pop ) Lewis . " There was nothing else he could do , " said Pitino. // Providence had beaten Georgetown once this season with the jump shot . Lewis won with a last-second trey on Jan. 28 . But twice more against the Hoyas the Friars had died by the jump shot , most recently in an 84-66 loss in the Big East semifinals when the G'town defenders smothered Donovan and held him to just 11 points . Pitino knew that to beat the Hoyas ( 29-4 going in ) once more  --  no team had beaten them since Groundhog Day  --  he would have to move the Friars ' game inside . He installed a new offense and the Friars shot 54.3% . Snip . // Next up to cut down the victory net were the big forwards and centers  --  average height 6 ' 9 "  --  David Kipfer , Steve Wright , Marty Conlon , Darryl Wright , Abdul Shamsid-Deen and Jacek Duda . Big snips . They combined to block 10 shots and score 52 points  --  all inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There Georgetown was , with its defense extended to the 19 ' 9 " line and only 6 ' 4 " Perry McDonald and promising 6 ' 7 " freshman Anthony Allen inside . That was the very best Georgetown could do inside without Reggie . " Their inside people did a great job , and they forced us to substitute small , " said Thompson . Had Thompson substituted big , he would have played right into Pitino 's hand . " I respect Providence , " said Thompson . " They play the game hard . We tried to turn the corner on them . They would n't let us. " // Georgetown 's frequent substitutions and cheek-to-cheek D normally cause opponents ' legs to go syrupy late in games . Pitino guarded against this , too . For the game 's first 10 minutes he did not ask Donovan to bring the ball up against the pressure . Pitino wanted Donovan for the end . Billy D would score 20 points , 16 on free throws , and most of those late , when the Friars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lead was never threatened in the second half . // But still the game was played out dramatically , a credit to Thompson 's style . When you 're in against the Hoyas there are no lulls . If the other Final Four teams are relieved because Georgetown was eliminated , they should n't be , because Providence under Pitino is playing the game like Georgetown  --  with a jump shot . The Friars , now 25-8 , have lost 15 straight games to Syracuse , their NCAA semifinal opponent , including two in the Big East this season , by a total of 13 points . But that was another Providence . // " People said we were just a three-point shooting team , " says Pitino . " And we will take that shot . It 's practiced , what we do . But we 're more than that . " The Friars did n't even try a trey against the Hoyas until 6:13 remained in the first half . Darryl Wright canned it . // Wright grew up in Harlem and starred at Cardinal Hayes High , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immature . Coach is a disciplinarian , " he says . " I did n't understand his criticism . I was put off the team . But coach let me back on in November . My family would n't let me leave anyway . They said be patient . I knew I could play . " // " More than anything , Darryl grew up as a man this season , " says Pitino . Real big snip . // Pitino 's thoughts were private as he watched the nets being cut down . Then a senior , Kipfer , spotted him and said , " You have to get up here . " A smiling Pitino tried to decline . Kipfer insisted . " You get up here , " he said . So Pitino climbed up a rickety stepladder and made the final snip . The view from there was great .
