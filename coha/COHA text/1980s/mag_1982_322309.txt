Charges of fraud raise new doubts as a power struggle looms <P> The elections that took place in El Salvador on March 28 were the centerpiece of U.S. policy toward that troubled Central American country . They were supposed to pave the way for a return to democracy , thereby reducing the appeal of leftist guerrillas who were alleged to be receiving aid from Nicaragua and Cuba . Noting the high turnout , President Reagan declared : " Now they really showed that there is a real desire for democracy there . " But last week the election results came under attack . An article based on research at the Jesuit-run Central American University in San Salvador suggested that the vote totals had been hyped outrageously . At the same time , the newly elected , rightist-dominated constituent assembly 's suspension of a significant part of the U.S.-backed land reform program put the Reagan Administration 's request for increased military and economic aid in serious jeopardy in Congress and set the stage for yet another power struggle within El Salvador . <P> The charges of election fraud were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who claimed that the total number of votes cast in the election had been vastly inflated , " with at least the knowledge of the United States Government . " Sheehan 's conclusions were based on calculations of the number of available ballot boxes , the hours polling booths remained open and the estimated time it would take each voter to cast a ballot . Sheehan suggested that the official tally of 1,485,185 votes could be more than double the number actually cast . He did not , however , challenge the election 's outcome . The university 's research , he wrote , suggests that while political leaders conspired to increase the overall turnout , they did not change the proportion of votes won by each party or the composition of the new assembly . <P> A senior diplomat in Washington quickly dismissed the study as " garbage . " Said State Department Spokesman Alan Romberg : " We reject the charge that the U.S. was party to any fraud . Nor did any of those countless observers on the site of the elections suggest there was fraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that it took voters 2 to three minutes each to cast their ballots . A more likely estimate , he said , ranged between 30 seconds and one minute . <P> In San Salvador , politicians took issue with Sheehan 's claim that the various parties had participated in a " pact " with the American embassy to go along with the inflated tally . But some conceded that election day had indeed been marred by irregularities . Said Luis Nelson Segovia , a deputy from the center-right Democratic Action Party : " The possibility of fraud has merit . There were so many variants and shortcomings on election day . But there is no proof . " Christian Democratic Party Spokesman Guillermo Antonio Guevara Lacayo agreed that there had been fraud , but said that the total number of votes in question was probably around 50,000 , rather than 700,000 to 800,000 . Said he : " They were mainly the result of breakdowns in the system and of incidents in small towns , but to think that the fraud was a premeditated campaign orchestrated by the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
