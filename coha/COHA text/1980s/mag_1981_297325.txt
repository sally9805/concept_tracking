IF ON A WINTER 'S NIGHT A TRAVELER by Italo Calvino Translated by William Weaver Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 260 pages ; $12.95 <P> Italo Calvino , quite possibly the best Italian novelist alive , is one of those storytellers who hold the mirror up to nature and then write about the mirror . The scholarly collector of Italian Folktales , Calvino can leave an impression that he would give anything to escape his self-conscious world of double takes and write a simple , earthy " Once upon a time ... " When an interviewer inquired about the intention of If on a winter 's night a traveler , Calvino answered : " I would like people to feel that beyond the written word is the multiplicity and unforeseeable aspect of life . " But seldom has the case against literature been argued more literarily , with such dazzling artifice and writer 's pure device . <P> Calvino 's latest novel is , in fact , an act of the imagination about ten acts of the imagination-gathering the fragments of ten separate novels into one . Says the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to say that the world is so rich and inexhaustible that writings can never keep up with it . " Perhaps not , but Calvino makes a manly effort . It all begins with that traveler on that winter 's night in a railroad station . Outside , much fog . Inside , much steam from the espresso machine . Suddenly the reader stumbles into the kitchen realism of a Polish novel featuring an onion being fried by a young woman called Brigd . Franz Kafka would be right at home . <P> Just as rudely , a Japanese novel interrupts . An innocent student literally trips into the lustful arms of the mother of his beloved . Crouched behind separate panels , the daughter and her father watch silently as the passion progresses-while ever so symbolically the ginkgo leaves fall in the garden . By avoiding eye contact with everybody , including the mother , the sensitive young man saves face all around . <P> Or so one assumes . For by then the reader is being shuttled back and forth into a sort of James Bond thriller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation for this terminal case of non sequitur ? Bungling in the bindery ? Or should blame-and credit-be assigned to the Organization for the Electronic Production of Homogenized Literary Works , operating out of New York to reduce all fiction to One Novel ? Or is the erratic anthology the fault of an odd chap named Ermes Marana , who dashes about the world scribbling novels in native languages and native styles , then dashes home to translate them ? <P> To play detective in his mystery of the mixed-up book , Calvino enlists a couple of readers : an unnamed male addressed only as " you " and a charming novel addict named Ludmilla , also known as the Other Reader . In the course of tracking down clues , the readers interview a senescent professor , an editor of a publishing house who talks like a rejection slip and a confirmed nonreader who glues books shut and applies a coat of varnish , thereupon producing pop sculptures . <P> By this time anything seems possible except that Calvino , 57 , now an editor of the Turin house Giulio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World War II Resistance , who believed , in his youth , that literature should be dedicated to " political engagement , " to " social battle .
