A Stanford researcher may have found the long-sought monopole <P> Its existence was predicted in 1931 by British Theoretical Physicist Paul Dirac , and scientists have been looking for it ever since-on the ocean floor , in meteorites , Arctic ice and even moon rocks . Dirac , one of the fathers of quantum theory , said that magnetic particles might exist that are exclusively " north " or " south . " Recent developments in quantum theory suggest that these single-poled units , or " monopoles , " would have immense mass , about 10 million billion times that of a proton at rest . Placed on a table , a monopole would prove so heavy in relation to its size that it would fall through the table and plummet until it settled in the core of the earth . Described by scientists as " twists of space , " monopoles are believed to have been formed during the Big Bang that marked the beginning of the universe . <P> Last week , at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington , D.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid off . A paper submitted to Physical Review Letters by Blas Cabrera , 35 , an assistant professor of physics at Stanford University , reports an " event " that Cabrera thinks may have been caused by a monopole . If Cabrera is correct , his discovery could validate the various " grand unification theories , " which postulate the existence of superheavy monopoles and hold that three natural forces-electro-magnetism , radioactivity and nuclear bonding-are manifestations of a single grand force . Monopoles might also account for the mass in the universe that cosmologists say is " missing " and would confirm current ideas about the basic building blocks of matter . <P> To detect a fugitive monopole , Cabrera used a kind of magnetic mousetrap , which was connected to a SQUID ( superconducting quantum interference device ) . He turned a coil of niobium , a platinum-gray metallic element , into a superconductor of electricity by cooling it to within nine degrees of absolute zero ( minus 460 F ) . Current thus moved through it without resistance , allowing the slightest twitch in the current 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , the magnetic flux in Cabrera 's device jumped eight steps , exactly what was expected if a Dirac monopole passed through . Cabrera , a little skeptical , hit his device with a screwdriver to see if that blow too would register a significant reading . It did not . After examining every possible explanation , Cabrera concluded that a monopole had moved through his equipment . " The event is striking , " says Cabrera . " We have not come up with an easy way to explain it . " <P>
