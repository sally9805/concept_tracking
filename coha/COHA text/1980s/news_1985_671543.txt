According to many experts , it is concerns such as these that may ultimately win that war , rather than the large , well-funded labs of big business or the Government. // The story of Oncogene Science is a classic tale of entrepreneurs driven by the urge to do well by doing good , a tale that is being played out in laboratories around the country today. // Oncogene Science , a three-year-old company 25 miles east of Manhattan in Mineola , L.I. , has yet to cash in . In fact , its findings still require years of testing and development . But it has repeatedly been courted by investment bankers who view it as ripe for selling public shares - and are eager to help. // // Highly Informal // In the meantime , it continues to run a highly informal shop whose 28 scientists - many in jeans - crowd into cubbyhole-size offices and seemingly makeshift laboratories. // About the only ones to wear ties are Oncogene ' s president , Robert E. Ivy , a former Revlon Inc. executive , and John R. Stephenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruited this year to provide modern management skills to Oncogene. // " Many of us want to replicate the environment of the computer business , " said Dr. Stephenson , a lanky , Canadian-born bachelor who regularly works 14-hour days and often comes in on weekends and holidays. // As is often the case in new ventures , Oncogene Science has had one individual who has nurtured the company through its infancy . That person is Gary Takata , a 50-year-old , shaggy-haired , Manhattan-based venture capitalist who , in March 1983 , persuaded an entire laboratory of National Cancer Institute scientists to resign their posts in Washington in favor of striking out on their own. // Mr. Takata argued that because the scientists ' work was chronicled in widely available professional journals , it would soon be taken over by private companies . To avoid that , the venture capitalist said , the scientists had to form their own company . <> <> ' You Had to Leave ' // " It was clear that if you wanted to stay in the field , you had to leave , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The research was moving from the pure research stage to commercialization. " // There are many other examples of cancer researchers who , in an effort to pursue their work , forsake academia or the Government for the private sector. // Immunex Inc. , another biotechnology concern , was started by researchers from the University of Washington . The Cetus Corporation , which manufactures Interleukin-2 , an anti-cancer drug that has shown promising results in shrinking tumors , has a former biochemist from the University of California at Berkeley as a founder . And Walter Gilbert , the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who established Biogen N.V. , another anti-cancer company , was at Harvard. // " The style of the times is privitization , " said Zenas Block , associate director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at New York University . " I would not be surprised if the cure for cancer did not come from N.C.I. , but from a small , private company . " <> <> They Stay Close // But while medical researchers may be leaving the nonprofit world to form businesses , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that meant locating near the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , a prominent cancer-research center on Long Island , as well as near leading medical research institutions in New York City. // The company settled on Mineola after the Nassau Community Hospital offered to rent it lab space overlooking the Long Island Rail Road station here . When things became too tight , the company spilled over into space above a nearby barber. // Even so , there is still no room for the company ' s laboratory animals , which must be shuttled in a van from temporary quarters at the State University of New York at Stony Brook . <> <> A Deadly Blood Cancer // But even in its cramped facilities , Oncogene Science has made progress . In its report in the New England Journal of Medicine , the company reported that it had found that a deadly blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia , or CML , develops when two normal genes combine to form a cancer-causing gene. // The same aberrant gene likely gives rise to other cancers , the researchers said . Their next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene is created . They will then try to formulate a drug to suppress the process. // While Oncogene ' s scientists are encouraged by their progress , there is no real product yet , except for some research done under contract , and thus only limited revenue . That is true of most fledgling biotech companies , which run on funding from big corporations , venture capitalists or rich individuals , and plan eventually to sell shares to the public . Oncogene Science fits this pattern. // The company found one well-heeled partner in Becton , Dickinson &; Company , the big Paramus , N.J. , medical products company . It paid $3 million for a 20 percent stake in Oncogene Science and for licensing rights should it develop an anticancer drug . <> <> A Private Placement // Mr. Takata , Oncogene Science ' s venture capitalist , raised an additional $3. 5 million from a private placement of shares to wealthy individuals . They own roughly 20 percent of Oncogene Science ' s stock. // The remaining 60 percent is held in roughly even proportions by the founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Oncogene Science calls its " scientific advisory board. " // " It ' s a classic , " said Joseph E. Millsap , the biotechnology analyst at L. F. Rothschild , Unterberg , Towbin . " You get a qualified venture capitalist , with some reasonably deep pockets , who recognizes a niche . He contacts scientists and tries to convince them that their research can be accelerated with the funding that a freestanding , private organization can obtain. " // As some experts see it , though , the money Oncogene Science has raised will not sustain it for long . It will need a huge amount of cash - upward of $100 million , some experts say - to fund clinical trials of its products . <> <> ' Every Big Name on Wall Street ' // Not surprisingly , Mr. Takata says a public offering of stock is imminent , and there is no shortage of investment bankers willing to underwrite the stock . " Just about every big name on Wall Street has been by to visit , " he said. // If Oncogene Science does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broad sections of the investing public will have another shot at sharing in the potential riches of biotech . If the past is any guide , however , that road will be a rocky one. // Industry experts says it takes six years from the time a company discovers a product to the time it can market it . So far , the profits in biotech have been minuscule , and the stocks of companies that have gone public have produced wild swings . Oncogene Science is expected to be no exception. //
