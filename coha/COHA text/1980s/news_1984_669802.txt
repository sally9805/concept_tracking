If it sometimes seems that this year ' s presidential contenders are mostly just rehashing a lot of old ideas , maybe it ' s time to give the candidacy of William Hurley a look . Mr. Hurley , a retired home builder from Birmingham , Ala. , would start his term in the White House by eliminating the Federal Reserve System , the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations . If Congress and the Treasury didn ' t close the deficit fast , he would eliminate them , too . He also would stop all immigration for seven years so the U.S. could count the people already here . Mr. Hurley is a little short on campaign funds right now , but he doesn ' t doubt that he has a chance to take the big prize in November . " No one thought Adolf Hitler could win , either , " he says . America ' s quadrennial White House sweepstakes is under way again , and once again it is bringing forth a host of entries . So far 156 candidates have registered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolishing the Constitution to revising the calendar to moving the capital to Davenport , Iowa . If the last election is any guide , their number will double before the contest closes next November . The obstacles in their path to the White House are high . Just collecting the signatures to get on various state ballots is a challenge , as is raising enough campaign donations ( $5 , 000 from each of at least 20 states ) to qualify for federal funds . And with a few notable exceptions , such as John Anderson in 1980 and George Wallace earlier , the independent and third-party candidates are freely ignored by both the news media and the voters . But if people would only listen , they might hear of some new solutions to the country ' s old problems . Consider nuclear war and its prevention . Susanna Dakin , a California performance artist and candidate for president , says that if she becomes commander in chief , she will attempt to get all world leaders to wire themselves to detonate seconds before nuclear weapons are launched . Mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman into the political arena , but they are too timid about it in the view of some of the challengers . For instance , how much public participation is there when the country has only one president ? Owen Frank Balding of Decatur , Ill. , would replace the Constitution with one providing for a dozen people to be president simultaneously . " What we have now , " explains the retired history teacher , " is one Hollywood actor who ' s trying to get us into a war . That decision should be in the hands of 12 people . " Mr. Balding was going to run for president in 1976 , but he got sinus trouble . He was all set in 1980 , but his wife filed for divorce . This year he finally is ready . If he wins , Mr. Balding says , he will replace both Congress and the Supreme Court with rotating groups of 435 citizens , chosen by lottery . Each group would serve one day as the country ' s legislature and one day as the Supreme Court . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded docket ; the judges-for-a-day would be required to reach one decision every morning and one every afternoon . Even without a regular Congress , though , the U.S. would be saddled with laws . But if Donald Badgley is elected , he promises to wipe the legislative slate clean . " Man-made rules destroy individual creativity , " says Mr. Badgley , a former insurance salesman from Poughkeepsie , N.Y. " Laws are like barnacles ; if you don ' t scrape them off , they sink the ship . " Another thing holding humanity back , Mr. Badgley continues , is a calendar that divides the week into seven days . If he is elected , he will install a six-day week and a 360-day year to make things " more harmonious with the universe , " he says . " Seven is an odd number that doesn ' t go into 365 , and that throws everything out of control , " explains the candidate , who wears his white hair and beard long and carries a staff . " Everything in the spirit is equal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six is a divine number , while seven represents Satan . Motives for becoming a presidential candidate seem almost as diverse as platforms . Garrett Trapnell got into the game four years ago because his mail wasn ' t being delivered . Mr. Trapnell , an airplane hijacker , was living in solitary confinement at a federal prison in Illinois at the time , and he hoped a candidacy would bring attention to his case . Mr. Trapnell has no complaints about postal service at his current address , the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta , but he is running for president again anyway . " America is sympathetic to the underdog , and last time I got 13 , 000 votes , " he says . " Voters were willing to overlook the criminal aspect . " Constitutional lawyers say he can ' t vote for himself but could , in theory , be elected president and grant himself a pardon . Isabell Masters says she decided to get into the race when she was on a bus from Washington , D.C. , to Topeka , Kan. , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was exhilarating , " says Mrs. Masters , 69 , a mother of six who has a doctorate in education . Running on the slogans " Save America from the present administration " and " End the war against Mother Nature , " she is hoping for the Democratic nomination . She doesn ' t use airplanes but hopes to hit 50 or 100 cities by bus or train . Fund raising doesn ' t worry her , she says : " The Lord will provide me with the money I need . " For Kip Lee of Redding , Calif. , this year ' s race is a dry run , because he is just 29 and you have to be 35 to be president . But Mr. Lee , a former service-station attendant and security guard , hopes to win in 1992 so he can start implementing his program : To install a barter system and do away with the dollar , since so many poor people don ' t have dollars . " I also have some good ideas to create jobs , " says Mr. Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meanwhile , Alphonso D. Steward is campaigning on a program of reorganizing the government . He has mapped out his prospective cabinet appointments already , including Jane Fonda for the Energy Department and Cary Grant for Agriculture . The 54-year-old Mr. Steward , a college student and part-time thrift-store worker , says he is already working on plans for his inaugural ball . All of these candidates no doubt have their strengths and weaknesses , but perhaps the most unusual qualifications belong to a challenger whom four women from Baltimore are backing . Their candidate stands just under four feet tall , always wears a silver satin suit with a pink bow , and has , they boast , a demonstrated ability to walk and swing both arms . The supporters are promoters of a greater U.S. effort in technology , and a few weeks ago they took their candidate , named Rebecca Robot , into a Federal Election Commission office . There Miss Robot formally registered as a candidate by drawing a small , mechanical " X " on the form . " Some of the cogs and wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , " says Sylvia Beall , one of the robot ' s supporters , by way of establishing her candidate ' s legitimacy . " With a staff , she could run the country . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
