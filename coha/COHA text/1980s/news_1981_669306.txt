Publishers in the United States currently offer more than 4 , 000 of these " large print " editions , and some 650 new titles are being published here or imported this year. // Although most of these books can be found in the nation ' s larger public libraries , and some are for sale in stores , many people don ' t know about them  --  and , as a result , may miss out on the pleasure of reading. // According to a 1978 survey conducted by the Book Industry Study Group , many eldely Americans give up reading because they find it difficult to cope with ordinary-size print. // It is these readers that large-printbook companies hope to reach , according to Virginia Reiser , a senior editor at G. K. Hall &; Co. in Boston , the oldest American publisher of large-print books still active in the field . Large-point editions were first developed by Ulverscroft , a British publisher , in 1964 . Hall entered the field in 1971. // Early large-print books were photographic enlargements of ordinary pages , which turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , but so were the books . A short novel looked more like an atlas , which made reading anywhere but at a table awkward if not impossible. // Over the last decade , however , Ulverscroft , Hall , and other publishers have made vast improvements . Today each book is specially designed and typeset , rather than enlarged from an existing version . The product is smaller , lighter , and more attractive  --  in fact , indistinguishable on the outside from ordinary books . Inside , however , the difference is dramatic : The type is clear and heavy ; the paper opaque , yet light in weight ; the spacing between words and lines carefully adjusted for ease in reading. // Large-print books are enthusiastically received by readers who know about them , says Dorothy Becker , coordinator of reader and information services at the Boston Public Library , which buys at least one copy of practically every general-interest book published in large print . " The collection is well used , especially by the elderly , even if they have very little problem with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Ms. Becker. // The users are not just those patrons who come to the downtown building or its branches . The Boston library has a " Homesmobile " , which takes 3 , 500 volumes a month ( one-third of which are large print ) to retirement and nursing homes. // Libraries in smaller communities , especially those that appeal to retirees , often maintain large-point collections . Florida ' s St. Petersburg Public Library has nearly several thousand large-print titles , according to Patricia M. Broad , chief of library extension. // Some of the volumes are donated by individuals who place standing monthly orders with large-print publishers , and then turn over the books to the library after reading them. // For four years , until funding cutbacks brought the effort to a close last month , the St. Petersburg library operated a program similar to Boston ' s . Each month " Senior Citizen Bookreach " took 4 , 000 volumes to 1 , 800 readers in residences for senior citizens and in nursing homes . Forty percent of the books were in large print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Broad explains . " Many of the people in their 80s and so on had excellent eyesight . The assumption that all people in nursing and retirement homes would need large print was quite incorrect. " // For those who did want the larger type , however , the program made quite a difference , Ms. Broad points out . A survey indicated that those who did no reading or who read fewer than 12 books a year prior to the program were reading from 12 to 72 books annually while it was funded. // The success of the St. Petersburg program could be repeated elsewhere in the future , according to the four biggest US distributors of large-print books . They anticipate a potential audience on the upswing , since the elderly segment of the US population is growing. // These publishers remain somewhat cautious , however . So far , the growth of sales has been slow , according to Oscar B. Stiskin , US representative for Ulverscroft . Today the competition among large-print publishers is growing at the same time library budgets are being pruned. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to buy their own copies , " says Mr. Stiskin , because they are on fixed incomes . For this reason , Ulverscroft , whose 168 new titles for 1981 sell for $12 each , is making no effort to place them in retail stores . Individuals who want any of the 1 , 400 Ulverscroft titles currently in print must order by mail from a catalog. // The same is true of the 216 new large-print titles being distributed this year by John Curley &; Associates Inc. , of South Yarmouth , Mass . Mr. Curley , who worked at G. K. Hall before starting his own company in 1976 , is publishing 72 titles himself and importing 144 from Magna Print and Chivers Press , two British firms . The Curley books are paperbacks , priced from $10. 95 to $13. 95 . Mr. Curley feels that , without sacrificing durability , his 1 , 000-title backlist offers the lightest-weight books available in the field  --  an important consideration for large-print publishers. // The newest firm to join the ranks is the Thorndike Press . It was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of G. K. Hall , who enjoys telling people his new company ' s world headquarters are " in the basement " of his house in Thorndike , Maine . Like Ulverscroft and Curley , Thorndike does not place its books in stores . Libraries are the main market for this year ' s 72 titles , published in attractive , lightweight , jacketless editions which range in price from $8. 95 to $13. 95 . This month , however , Thorndike will begin marketing its titles on a single-book , mail-order basis to individuals as well . Thorndike ' s 60 titles for 1980 , the company ' s first large-print series , are also available. // G. K. Hall , which will publish 140 library titles priced from $14. 95 to $16. 95 this year , is unique in offering a bookstore line of 12 paperbacks . Priced from $8. 95 to $10. 95 , these are in hundreds of stores around the US ( including the B. Dalton and Waldenbooks chains ) , many of which also stock the 12 paperbacks from 1980 , the first year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers aim for popular titles , with emphasis on fiction that appeals to an over-50 audience . Hall features current best-sellers in its retail program , including for this year " Smiley ' s People , " by John le Carre , " The Key to Rebecca , " by Ken Follett , " Bendigo Shafter , " by Louis L ' Amour , and " Murder in the White House , " by Margaret Truman. // Ulverscroft prefers books that are three or four years old and have proven popular over the long haul . Their 1981 titles include " The Boat who Wouldn ' t Float , " by Farley Mowat , " Proteus , " by Morris West , " Athabasca , " by Alistair MacLean , " Green Money , " by D. E. Stevenson , " Galloway , " by Louis L ' Amour , and " The Mallen Litter , " by Catherine Cookson. // Curley offers an appealing mixture of old and new , with " Plains Song , " by Wright Morris , " Or Was He Pushed ? " by Richard Lockridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lay Jr. and Sy Bartlett , " The Thawing of Mara , " by Janet Dailey , and " A Game with Hearts , " by Barbara Cartland featured on this year ' s list. // Thorndike ' s catalog includes such recent books as " A Window Over the Sink , " by Peg Bracken , " The Scapegoat , " by Mary Lee Settle , and " Good Companions , " by Era Zistel . It also offers older titles , such as " The Thundering Herd , " by Zane Grey. // With printings for each title averaging fewer than 2 , 500 copies nearly 17 years after the appearance of large-print books , the volumes still are reaching only a small fractioin of the 13 , 000 public libraries in the US and only a tiny percentage of retail buyers . But as the books become more generally known , and as the elderly segment of the population continues to grow , publishers expect an increase in demand , though they are the first to admit it may not happen for a few years. // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who had given up books to rediscover the pleasure of reading .
