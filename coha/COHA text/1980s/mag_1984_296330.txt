OH , GOD ! YOU DEVIL <P> In his third outing as the stand-up Supreme Being , George Burns , 88 , adds a new wrinkle : he also plays Satan . Quotable quips from Writer Andrew Bergman ( The In-Laws ) include the Lord 's back-lot zinger , " I put the fear of me in you , " and Talent Agent Harry O. Tophet 's devilish irreverence , " He had to close the big dining room up there . " Tophet cuts a deal with a young songwriter ( Ted Wass ) , offering fame in exchange for his soul . Director Paul Bogart 's muzzy little comedy appropriately pivots on the Burns-Burns confrontation when Lucifer and the Lord play poker in Caesars Palace to win the yuppie Faustus . Oh , God ! You Devil has a shopping-mall message : Do n't do drugs or dream of fame ; go home , be ordinary . If only Gracie were alive to play the devil 's advocate , this biblical vaudeville might have had a little more class . <P> <P> PARIS , TEXAS <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the desert , mute and loco . His square brother ( Dean Stockwell ) hauls Travis home to be reunited with his young son ( Hunter Carson ) . Now Travis goes searching , with the boy in tow , for his long-lost wife ( Nastassja Kinski ) . Welcome to the new West , pardner , where the myth of the loner is yoked to the grail of domestic reconciliation . No wonder Paris , Texas is as powerfully schizoid as its title : German director ( Wim Wenders ) , American screenwriter ( Sam Shepard ) , the clashing strategies of an international cast . With his gorgeous , precise images of the American Southwest , Wenders suggests a cinematic landscape artist forced by the moneylenders to add some human figures to the picture . Their motivations refuse to parse , and the film ends up where Travis began : parched and lost in a desert of its own device . <P> <P> A NOS AMOURS <P> Sandrine Bonnaire has a peasant sensuality ; naked , she looks like the figurehead on a pirate ship . The camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voil a deep dimple appears incongruously in her left cheek . From wanton to elfin in the flick of an adolescent whim-such are the compelling mysteries of personality . Bonnaire stars as the teen-age Suzanne in this doggedly unsentimental French film from Writer-Director Maurice Pialat . Suzanne 's family has stayed together by corseting all hostilities . Then she discovers the power of her own erotic impulse . Overnight , Daddy 's little girl is a slut in Mama 's eyes , and the family falls into convulsions of jealousy and hatred . Like the off-Hollywood films of John Cassavetes , A Nos Amours is less drama than psychodrama ; it wears its artlessness as a badge of intrepid truth-telling . Bonnaire 's artlessness though , marks her as an exotic found object and a genuine movie find .
