 |p504  IN THE SEA GREEN twilight the great jointed stalks of grass stand like jade columns supporting a submerged palace . The foot-thick culms glisten in the submarine light and rise for a hundred feet among dagger leaves that stir with a susurrus like surf on a distant shore . A passing breeze rubs the tapering stems together , and subdued groans , stuttering creaks , and a small scream fall from the moving canopy . Are you Alice , sipping from the bottle labeled " Drink me , " and shrunk to elfin size ? Or have you wandered into Gulliver 's Brobdingnagian world , where even the grasses of the field reach for the sky ? No , you are of normal size , walking in a grove of bamboo , the giant tree grass that is the most versatile , and to me the most beautiful , plant on earth . Bamboo is all things to some men , and some things s to all men . It enriches the soil ; binds the earth against raging floods and the shocks of earthquakes ; gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toys to divert his children , and weapons with which to fight his fellow creatures . Bamboo provides us paper , a stylus to set down praise of its own beauty , and the brush to make ink-limned images of its graceful culms and lanceolate leaves . No growing thing has so many and so varied uses as bamboo ; one scientist has even distilled from it a diesel-engine fuel . Scholars have compiled catalogs of well over a thousand applications for the elegant grass , which occurs naturally in every continent except Europe and Antarctica but seems happiest in southern Asia ( map , page 506 ) . In the world there are about a thousand species of bamboo , of some 50 genera . They range from plants the size of field grass to giants of 120 feet in height and a foot in @# @# thickness . They grow from the sea-level tropics to 13,000-foot mountain slopes . Though they vary widely in color , shape , and size , they share one common characteristic , the woody culm , or stalk . A few are solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or nodes ( page 514 ) . The light . stiff , and strong culms are what make bamboo so valuable to so many . The most striking characteristic of bamboo is its vertiginous growth . No other living thing grows so tall so fast . Near Kyoto a Japanese scientist measured the world 's record . A culm of ma-dake ( Phyllostachys bambusoides ) , Japan 's commonest bamboo . grew almost four feet in 24 hours . By watching closely , one should have been able to see it grow . An engineer living near Washington . D. C. , had a clump of 18-foot-high bamboo growing up a stairwell inside his house . " We would measure the new shoots at the beginning of an evening 's bridge session , " he said . " When the evening ended , I would say to my partners , We have played one and a half inches . ' " The Chinese , precursors in culture and technology , were the first to appreciate the beauty and usefulness of bamboo . Their ancient dictionary , the Erh Ya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ts'ao , a grass . My own interest in bamboo arose many years ago when I was moved to attempt to make a fishing rod of split-and-glued bamboo , and became fascinated by the virtues of the material I was using . A long time ago some nameless genius had the idea of splitting a culm of bamboo into strips , tapering them , then gluing them together to make a strong , slender , and superlatively springy implement that could cast an artificial fly a great distance , even against a stiff breeze . Here , as in so many other things , the Chinese were far in advance of the West : one book tells of them splitting and gluing  |p507  bamboo long before the birth of Christ . Though now largely supplanted by glass and carbon fiber , the best split-bamboo fishing rods are made from tonkin cane , which , despite the name , comes from southern China . It remains the world 's most valuable bamboo species for a variety of purposes . Dr. F. A. McClure , who at the time of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the world 's greatest authority on bamboo , traveled to China as a botanical explorer in the 1920s . There he sought the home of tonkin cane . Years later he described his search to me : " I began by recalling a jingle common round Canton Guangzhou : Waitsap nuk , Kwong Ning chuk , ' which is to say in Cantonese : For wood go to Waitsap Huaiji , for bamboo to Kwong Ning Guangning . ' Both are places on the Sui River , which flows toward Canton from the northwest . I started upriver , inquiring as I went . As I neared Waitsap , the bamboos on both sides of the river changed . Unlike the graceful , nodding bamboos farther downstream , these were stiff , erect , and spiky . From a distance the plantations looked like young fir trees . " The farmers called it ch'a kon chuk ? tea stick bamboo . Now , bamboo has a peculiarity . Most of it flowers only at long intervals-30 , 60 , or even 120 years apart . At about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the world ? will burst into flower . Then the drooping branches look like heads of wheat ( page 514 ) . When this happens , the culms die , but the groves survive because some rhizomes live on and the fallen seeds take root . For a bamboo seedling to reach full growth and maturity may take five to ten years ; meanwhile the growers face economic disaster . The farmer 's misfortune was the scientist 's good luck . McClure found whole areas of tea stick bamboo in bloom , and he was able to collect flowering specimens , which , together with branching nodes and sheaths from young culms , the botanist needs to make scientific identification . McClure identified it as an Arundinaria , a genus named from a type native to the  |p508  United States , and now he gave his new species the name amabilis , lovely . Arundinaria amabilis McClure , the lovely bamboo . NORTHWEST the road ran from Guangzhou toward Huaiji , between paddies diked with red earth . Young rice shoots thrust yellow-green fingers from the brown water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sky . Endless rows of pine and eucalyptus , planted in their millions in China 's massive afforestation scheme , furred the hills of Guangdong ( Kwangtung ) . Beside the road clumps of yellow-stalked bamboo nodded , and my companion , Mr. Chen Shu-yu , poetic and hospitable like all his countrymen , said : " The bamboos bow in greeting to you . " I bowed in return . At dusk the road swung closer to the wide . fast-flowing Sui River , and the scattered clumps of bamboo closed ranks and became a dense plantation . Through the gloaming I saw that the bamboo , now dark green , had lost its feathery grace and had grown stiff and upright , standing in serried ranks like Christmas trees : the tea stick , or lovely bamboo , found by Floyd McClure .  |p509  In Huaiji , a county seat of gray-tiled-roof houses , I was the guest of the regional Revolutionary Committee . The town lies 165 feet above sea level , but on both sides of the Sui River the hills rose row on row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whispering rain . We boarded a riverboat and motored downstream with the current . The river , gliding swiftly and silently , glistened like slate , and a pearl gray mist made ghosts of the bamboo thickets along the shore . " The best tea stick bamboo grows at heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet , " said Mr. Chi Jui-wu , vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee . " The feather-headed bamboo you see along the riverbanks is yellow bamboo , thinner and more flexible than tea stick . We make scaffolding of it . Bamboo , for many purposes , is lighter and stronger than steel . " We grow eight kinds of bamboo in Guangdong Province , but here tea stick is king . I do n't know why we call it tea stick ; possibly the pale yellow of the dried culm resembles the color of freshly brewed tea . " In China nature does imitate art . A sandspit at a bend of the river ahead seemed to  |p510  hang suspended between earth and sky , and in the flat two-dimensional world of grays and blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition from China 's ink-painting masters . " Before liberation and the establishment of the People 's Republic in 1949 , " said Mr. Chi , " there were only 17,000 acres of tea stick bamboo in Guangdong ; now we farm 42,000 acres of it . Our production is about 40,000 tons a year , six times what it used to be . We export about 5,000 tons . Tonkin , as the trade calls it , goes all over the world , but Europeans are our best customers . They use it in horticulture , as supports for tomatoes , melons , hops , and fruits . Scandinavia imports it for ski poles and to mark the borders of roads buried under snow . These are the small , finger-thick sizes . Bigger ones make poles for vaulters , and the largest , as much as two inches in diameter , go to makers of fishing rods and furniture . " In the 1930s tea stick bamboo was introduced into the United States and planted in botanical gardens in Georgia , Louisiana , and Puerto Rico , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FAINTLY through the curtain of rain I could see figures of men and women among the glistening bamboos on the slopes , felling the mature culms and throwing them down to the river 's edge , where they were bound into bundles and laid in overlapping layers like shingles on a roof , forming immense rafts nearly a hundred feet long . Rounding a bend , we came upon a moving floor of bamboo , hundreds of rafts tied together . Beyond , below the tile roofs of a village , bundles of drying bamboo stood in hourglass columns on the bank . Ashore on a beach we watched workers seated on small stools in six inches of water , scrubbing each culm with a handful of sand . " A culm must be three to five years old before cutting , " said Mr. Chi . " Bamboo will sprout and reach its full height in six to eight weeks , and then the culms look beautiful , glossy , green , without a blemish . But new culms are mostly water , and if you cut them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man before us circled a culm with a cloth full of sand . Inching the pole from the 510 water , he scrubbed vigorously , turning it as he scoured . The long shaft , blotched and spotted as if from skin disease with black and white patches of fungus and lichen , emerged sage green and shining . " The culms dry in the air and sun for ten days , " Mr. Chi continued . " Then we ship them by boat downstream to Nanhai , near Guangzhou , where they are straightened over a fire and cut to length . " IN CHINA there are some 300 species of bamboo , of 26 genera . Of these , tonkin is the most known and prized overseas , but within China the single most useful bamboo is a large cane called mao chu , hairy bamboo ( Phyllostachys pubescens ) , from the fine hair covering its culm sheaths . Fully two-thirds of the bamboo China produces is mao chu , which is used to make furniture and even as reinforcement rods in heavy construction . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I listened to Dr. W. Y. Hsiung , China 's leading bamboo authority . " Every day our written language reminds us of the antiquity of China 's partnership with bamboo . The radical chu ? a character indicating sense ? depicts two leafed twigs of bamboo . " The doctor made rapid brush strokes : t . " Chu by itself means bamboo . but this radical enters into hundreds of other words and phrases . " Our earliest records , long before the invention of paper in the second century B.C .. were written on slips of green bamboo . It is easy to scratch or incise on bamboo 's smooth skin , unique in the plant kingdom . To make a bamboo book , strips were strung together with silk or ox sinew . One such bundle of 312 slips was recently unearthed in a Han Dynasty second century B.C. tomb . " Why is such importance given to bamboo in China ? Because of its beauty and its multiple good qualities . We call bamboo the chief member of the trio of winter friends . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur together throughout Chinese art and literature as symbols of resistance to hardship . The plum flowers while snow is still on the ground , the pine flourishes in poor soil and clings to precipitous cliffs , and the bamboo remains green throughout the year . @# turning it as blotched and e with black and lichen . g. id sun for ten " hen we ship Nanhai , near straightened @# 00 species of ese , tonkin is overseas , but  |p511  bowing under the weight of winter snows but quickly springing upright again when the snows are gone . " Philosophers say the smooth expanse between nodes represents virtue , a long distance between faults , and the hollow interior bespeaks modesty and humility . " In the garden of the college I saw culms of a dozen species , some as thin as a pencil ; others , like hairy bamboo , almost eight inches thick ; yellow bamboo ; pale green bamboo ; black ? really a dark purple-brown ? bamboo ; another , square in cross section ; and a bamboo with internodes that ballooned like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buddha 's belly bamboo , Bambusa ventricosa , named by your great Dr. McClure , " said Dr. Hsiung with a smile . " It is planted purely for ornament . " One prolific bamboo I saw , Sinarundinaria nitida , grows in dense thickets high in the mountains of Sichuan ( Szechwan ) Province and furnishes food for the rare giant panda . In a wildlife disaster still to be fully assessed , Chinese scientists have found 140 dead pandas in those remote interior hills , apparently victims of the inexorable biological clocks of two related bamboo species . Reaching the end of their century-long life cycles , the bamboos have been flowering and dying en masse ; it may take several years before the groves have recovered enough to provide a dependable food source again . Meanwhile , experts fear , a significant proportion of the world 's panda population ? totaling perhaps no more than a thousand ? may perish of starvation . " BAMBOOS FALL into two main categories , " Dr. Hsiung said , " first classified according to growth pattern by Dr. McClure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bamboos . All bamboos come up from rhizomes , underground stems that send up shoots . Clump types multiply symmetrically outward in a circle ; the runner kind sends its rhizomes in all directions , throwing up new culms here and there . " Clump types are usually tropical , and the runners , temperate zone plants . " In the United States hardy bamboos from China or Japan are used for ornamental plantings . Gardeners struck by the beauty  |p515  of bamboo are eager to plant it , then are dismayed when it runs wild , poking its head up on a neighbor 's property . There are remedies : Confine the underground rhizomes by sinking metal or plastic edging down two feet or , when the brittle new shoots come up in the spring , kick them over . Typically , bamboo sends up new shoots every year ; in between , the rhizome develops underground . Unlike a tree , bamboo does not acquire more girth as it grows ; the new sprout emerges full diameter . It reaches full height in 60 to 90 days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture . " The farmer goes into the bamboo groves in spring , " said Dr. Hsiung , " and by walking barefoot over the ground , he can feel the hard bumps of the sprouts . If he wants the tenderest shoots , like blanched asparagus , he piles a little mound of earth round the emerging sprout , so that it never sees the light of day . " I had heard that in the old China there was a spring ceremony or pastime . People would go to the bamboo groves on a quiet night to listen for the audible pop of bamboo sprouts bursting their sheaths as they emerged from the ground ? a sure sign of spring . All Chinese hospitals have a department of herbal medicine where ancient remedies are used together with medicines from the Western pharmacopoeia . A Nanjing physician told me that the rhizome of the black bamboo , compounded with other plants , treats kidney ailments . " If you heat a freshly cut black bamboo and drink the moisture that runs out of it , " he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The culm of a bamboo used for bridges , Sinocalamus affinis , burned to ashes , will cure prickly heat . " In some tropical bamboos a secretion called tabasheer forms and hardens between the nodes . Chinese , Indians , and other Asian peoples prescribed this for coughs and asthma , as a cooling tonic , and even @#  |p516  that Golden Fleece of Eastern medicine ? as an aphrodisiac . Since tabasheer is nearly 97 percent pure silica , which is chemically inert , it probably requires an additional large dose of faith . But , as often happens in folk medicine , there is something there , and researchers have recently found that tabasheer acts as a catalyst in some chemical reactions . As bamboo finds its place in medicine , so does it too in engineering . Chinese bridges , hanging from cables of twisted bamboo , are ancestors of all the world 's suspension spans . The use of bamboo cables for towing ships in China was first described by Marco Polo for the 13th-century Western world : " The cables . . . are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I have spoken before , fully fifteen paces in length . They split them and bind them together into lengths of fully 300 paces , and they are stronger than if they were made of hemp . " Indeed , stronger . The great bridge over the Min River in Sichuan hangs from bamboo cables nearly seven inches in diameter , wound round capstans so that they can be tightened like tuning a guitar . The Min bridge , still in use after more than 1,000 years , is justly renowned as one of the engineering marvels of the world . CHINA , the world 's oldest continuous civilization , sent much of its culture to Japan more than a thousand years ago . Most of Japan 's 662 kinds of bamboo , of 13 genera , flourish in the mild climate of Kyushu , the southernmost island , but the bamboo capital is Kyoto . Here I met Dr. Koichiro Ueda , Japan 's premier bamboo scientist , known throughout the islandnation as " Dr. Bamboo " ( facing page ) . On Kyoto 's outskirts Dr. Ueda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bamboo I have ever seen . From the ground to a height of four or five feet the nodes seemed to go mad ; they zigzagged diagonally up the culm , leaving triangular internodes that swelled in convex blisters . " Kikko-chiku ? tortoiseshell bamboo , " said Dr. Bamboo , " a variety , heterocycla , of the hairy bamboo . We are not sure what causes it , but sometimes the trait is recessive and the culms revert to standard shape . Groves that persistently produce the tortoiseshell form are very valuable ; it is much in demand for ornament . " Particularly distorted tall culms of tortoiseshell fetch high prices in Japan . IN JAPAN , even more than China , people use bamboo for decoration . The classic wood-and-paper Japanese house utilizes bamboo in ceilings , moldings , rainspouts , gutters , and , particularly , as the corner post of the tokonoma , the viewing alcove where works of art are displayed . In Kyoto an amazing number of things are made of bamboo : baskets , flutes , bows and arrows , dueling staves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flower stands , dolls . scarecrows , garden fences , and artifacts for the tea ceremony . In a collection in Japan I saw for the first time a bamboo wife , invented centuries ago in China to bring solace to hot nights . It is a woven basketwork cylinder about five feet long , which the sleeper embraces and throws one leg over , so that cooling breezes can pass through . Among the myriad uses of bamboo listed in the literature , I had come across a curious entry : " Torture . " Man 's inhumanity to man has made use even of mankind 's best friend in the plant world . Many bamboos have culm sheaths covered with a down of fine hairs . Beware of touching these ! They will get under the skin and produce intense irritation . Bacteria on the hairs could even cause blood poisoning . I had read that in ancient times sheath hairs were mixed with food to get rid of an enemy .  |p522  AN EVEN MORE lurid use of bamboo I had heard of was staking a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts said , impale the victim as it grew . In one of Dr. Ueda 's books I had seen a picture of a bamboo shoot growing through a sheet-iron roof . " I took that picture , " said the doctor . " The shoot had pushed through a joint . But I do not believe that a shoot would ever grow through a man . It would simply turn and come up beside him , as I have seen it do at the edge of a house . " The doctor had pointed out to me a white waxy substance coating the internodes of first-year culms . In former times in Japan and China this wax made candles to light the homes of great lords . Bamboo continued to give light to man down to modern times . When Thomas Edison , one of the last of the great empirical inventors , was working on his electric lamp , he tried more than 6,000 materials for the filament : paper , leather , pomegranate peel , spaghetti , cotton , silk , vegetable fiber , even the hairs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were charred fibers of ma-dake , Japan 's commonest bamboo , growing around a Shinto shrine , Iwashimizu Hachiman , on a hill in Kyoto . Ironically , when I visited Iwashimizu shrine there was no ma-dake in sight . All the Phyllostachys bambusoides in Japan had been flowering and dying for years . I was prepared for this because the madake growing in Washington , D. C. , gardens had been flowering at the same time . The curious trait of gregarious flowering makes all the bamboo of a given species burst into flower at about the same time . Botanists say the plants have a genetic imprint , as children of one family may all have blond hair and blue eyes . A Japanese scientist has traced the flowering of black bamboo back more than 1,000 years . The first recorded was in A.D. 813 , and documents showed it had blossomed every 120 years . In communities that depend on bamboo , flowering is a disaster . A few culms may survive , but most die , and the grove must carry on from the surviving rhizomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the size of a knitting needle , and each succeeding culm is larger than the one before , until maximum size for the species is reached . Most bamboos send up culms every year ; meantime , the rhizome extends its growth underground . The real tragedy of flowering used to take place in India . Most bamboo fruits look like grains of wheat , but an Indian bamboo , Melocanna baccifera , produces a fruit like a small pear . When Melocanna flowers at intervals of about 30 years , the big pulpy fruits drop to the ground . Rats devour them and multiply prodigiously . In former times National Geographic , October 1980  |p525  the rat explosion triggered outbreaks of plague or devastated wheat and rice crops . Thus the flowering of Melocanna meant disease , starvation , or both . On the other hand , flowering of other bamboos has helped avert famine , when the people roasted and ate the seeds . When I saw Melocanna growing in the foothills of the Himalayas , I was disappointed not to find it in fruit . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers told me . " Come back then . " IN NEW DELHI I talked with Mr. S. A. Shah , deputy inspector general of forests for India . " Bamboo is the poor man 's multipurpose timber , " he told me . The Indian farmer literally lives with bamboo from birth to death . As in China and Japan , the Indian countryman used to have his umbilical cord cut with a bamboo knife . He is rocked to sleep in a bamboo cradle ; as a man , he farms with tools made of it ; he feeds it to his cattle , and eats it himself . Ultimately , he is carried to his grave on a bier made of bamboo . " In India we have the world 's largest reserves of bamboo , some ten million hectares 25 million acres . This is one-fifth of our forest reserves . We cut selectively from wild bamboo stands . But always the countryman has priority , and he is allowed to take what he needs for his daily life . To the Indian farmer , bamboo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his support in death . " From New Delhi I journeyed north by train to Dehra Dun , site of one of the world 's most important forestry research institutes . Founded in 1878 , the institute today is an imposing series of buildings on a 1,100-acre campus , some 2,000 feet above sea level in the foothills of the Himalayas . Mr. R. C. Ghosh , director of forestry research , showed me round the laboratories , workshops , botanical gardens , and museum . At the New Forest campus we walked through bamboo groves of 35 species . Here I saw for the first time the king of bamboos , Dendrocalamus giganteus , of Burma , which grows 120 feet high and a foot in diameter . The largest culm I saw was 98 feet high and 11 inches thick ; it would weigh more than 200 pounds . A bamboo from Assam , Dendrocalamus  |p528  hamiltonii , once figured in a curious bit of fraudulent trade . For centuries the Chinese have valued rhinoceros horn ( really an overgrown hair ) as an aphrodisiac and a remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhizome , " said Mr. Ghosh , " trim it carefully , and ship it to China as genuine rhinoceros horn . It was almost impossible to tell the difference . Whether real or false , the horns still had to be smuggled out , as the Indian species of rhinoceros had been hunted nearly to extinction . " As always happens , the defrauders got greedy ; they turned out too many and the trade collapsed . Less colorful but of infinitely more use to India and to the world were some of the other uses I saw bamboo put to in the workshops and laboratories at Dehra Dun : supplanting steel as reinforcement for concrete ; laminated with plastic under pressure to make building walls , windmill blades , and the hulls of boats ; replacing steel bolts in construction . Most impressive of all was paper of a dozen kinds , from heavy brown kraft to fine coated printing stock . In India 66 percent of all paper used comes from the giant grass . The yield of an acre of bamboo does not equal that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culm reaches full growth in two to three months and is harvestable in three to four years ; a tree might take 20 years . On a paperhungry planet rapidly being denuded of its forests , bamboo may yet be a savior . SCIENTISTS on the frontiers of technology , in such fields as aerospace , are making increased use of an exciting new generation of construction materials called two-phase , or composite , materials . These consist of man-made fibers embedded in a matrix that holds them in parallel bundles . Fiberglass has been known for a long time , and , recently , mangrown fibers of boron , carbon , and other elements have produced materials with amazing stiffness and strength-to-weight ratios . Engineers involved in the work call it the " new science of strong materials . " New , did they say ? What are these twophase materials but man-made analogues of bamboo ? The strength of the miraculous grass lies in bundles of fibers running the length of the culm held in a matrix of pith , precisely as in the new " strong materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILOSOPHER SAID that those who are ignorant of history are doomed to relive it . Modern scientists , well knowing their natural history , turn increasingly to bamboo for both instruction and for use . For strength , lightness , stiffness , and , above all else , for cheapness , bamboo can well hold its own with manmade counterparts . It may prove to be the ideal material for rapidly spinning flywheels that would store noiseless , pollution-free energy , and perhaps someday bamboo may even be put to use in spaceflight and rocketry . The humble grass may yet leave its parent world on a tongue of flame , shielding its inseparable companion , man , even in the unthinkable cold of space . Until they invented paper more than two thousand years ago , the Chinese wrote their literature and history on bamboo slips . The smooth green skin of bamboo continues to invite inscription , and a few years ago the Orvis Company , a celebrated maker of fishing rods in the United States , found in a shipment of bamboo from Guangdong a culm inscribed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cane he cut would travel across the sea , had scribed : " Peoples of the brotherhood of man ! May our friendship last 10,000 years ! " Bamboo , steadfast friend of man down the centuries , had spoken . 528 National Geographic , October 1980
