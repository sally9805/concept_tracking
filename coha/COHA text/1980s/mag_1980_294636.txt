The recession rumbles on , and all bets are off <P> For millions of Americans , from cash-strapped home buyers to laid-off auto workers to jittery Wall Street investors , the single most cheering result of the economy 's spring-long slide has been the dizzy drop in interest rates from their alpine heights of last winter . Only three months ago , banks were charging their best corporate clients 20% interest . That rate last week was down as low as 11% . The question now is whether it will stay down , and for how long . <P> When the cost of money shot up early this year , consumer spending tailed off , the economy and the stock market started to slump , and unemployment lines began to lengthen almost everywhere . Yet now that the recession has cooled the demand for money , the high cost of borrowing has steadily dropped . This is making it somewhat easier for people to buy a house or a car , or perhaps just go out to dinner on a credit card . <P> Meanwhile , a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that Chairman Paul Volcker would like to see those volatile rates remain low in order to prevent the recession from getting any worse . The Fed has switched from a draconian clampdown on the growth of money all spring to a breathless 14.9% annual rate of increase in June . Moreover , it has begun cautiously lowering the levels to which it will let certain key interest rates sink . At the same time , the U.S. central bank , in a further effort to feed cash and credit back into the economy , is also phasing out the panoply of temporary credit controls that it placed on the economy last March . <P> There are already signs that the changes are having at least a modestly stimulative effect . During June , retail sales climbed 1.4% from May 's depressed level , and construction starts on new houses jumped to an annual rate of 1.2 million units , an increase of 30% over May . But this is still far below last June , when 1.9 million dwellings were built on an annual basis . <P> Automakers last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed a modest improvement , dropping 19% below the same period of 1979 , instead of the 23% decline that the industry has been experiencing since January . And mercurial Wall Street continued its recent strong showing , as the Dow Jones industrial average hit 923.98 , its highest level in three years . <P> The steep economic downturn still continues . Figures released last week showed that the nation 's business declined at an annual rate of 9.1% between April and June . And industrial production plunged 2.4% last month , matching May in the steepest such drop since January 1975 , when the economy was struggling to climb out of the last recession . <P> President Carter will send to Congress this week his midyear economic review , and the reading will be glum . As late as March , the Administration was gamely forecasting a 1980 budget deficit of no more than $36 billion to $38 billion and a 1981 surplus of $16.5 billion . But with unemployment soaring and tax receipts slumping , those optimistic targets now lie hopelessly beyond reach . As a result , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by at least another $27 billion in red ink next year .
