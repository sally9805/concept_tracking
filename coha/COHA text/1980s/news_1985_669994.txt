WASHINGTON  --  Every year , the government is bilked out of millions of dollars by contractors and federal employees who make false claims . But because these small-scale swindles individually seem puny , the Justice Department seldom moves against them . A bill to bring swift punishment to those who sneak past the prosecutors is being marshaled through the Senate with general support from the Reagan administration , which is publicly touting its get-tough stance toward white-collar crime . Who would oppose a plan to crack down on waste , fraud and abuse ? Answer : the nation ' s largest defense contractors . " They ' re lobbying strongly against it , " says Sen. Carl Levin ( D. , Mich . ) . He says his office has received a parade of officials from TRW Inc . , Avco Corp . , General Dynamics Corp. and Lockheed Corp . Backers of the legislation are irate . " They want to maintain the status quo and escape liability for false claims , " fumes GOP Sen. William Cohen of Maine . The defense contractors , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill would deprive defendants of due process by setting up government tribunals to try cases . They also warn that the bill could unfairly penalize people who unwittingly file false claims . Although the bill would apply throughout government , the arms-makers have almost single-handedly taken up the lobbying effort . More than other interests , they have some immediate concerns : The Defense Department ' s inspector general is investigating more than 40 big contractors for possible false claims and other procurement violations . If the bill passes , it will strengthen the hand of the investigators and will increase the likelihood of steep financial penalties for anyone found to have filed false claims . Sen. Cohen says he ' s convinced that the existing investigations are " part of the reason " for the contractors ' lobbying stampede . " Our concern is due process , " insists one industry lobbyist who , like many others , asked not to be identified . But this official also acknowledges that the 40-odd investigations are one reason for the opposition . " Nobody discounts that , " he says . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other agencies , would create a system of administrative law judges inside government agencies to hear such cases and impose civil penalties . Investigators would be armed with authority to subpoena testimony in pursuit of a possible fraud , authority that exceeds that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Such a system has been in place since 1981 at the Department of Health and Human Services , and administration officials say it has cut down on abuses in medical claims . " If you ' re a crooked doctor , there ' s a much greater likelihood that you ' ll be prosecuted than if you ' re a crooked contractor , " charges Howard Cox , an attorney in the Defense Department inspector general ' s office . The Pentagon has pushed for an internal procedure for civil fraud for the past three years , but defense contractors have defeated the effort so far . This year , Defense Department officials hope , headlines about $659 ashtrays and the like will help push the bill through . Pentagon officials say much of the push stems from exasperation in dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Michigan contractor who billed the military $900 , 000 for maintenance work that had never been performed . The Pentagon refused to pay the bill and informed the Justice Department . But the Justice Department declined to investigate the matter because the government hadn ' t actually lost money . Mr. Cox says that under current law , the most the Pentagon could do was seek a $2 , 000 penalty in a civil court action . Under the bill , false claims would bring a $10 , 000 penalty plus damages equal to twice the amount fraudulently claimed . The Navy was similarly frustrated recently when the Naval Investigative Service concluded that a contractor in Norfolk , Va. , had filed more than $600 , 000 in fraudulent claims for maintenance work . Because some of the evidence was ambiguous , the Navy suggested that the Justice Department prosecute only what the service considered the most blatantly fraudulent claims , amounting to $25 , 000 . But the Justice Department decided that amount was too small to justify the effort . A paper being distributed by the Aerospace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to jury trial . " Moreover , the industry group argues that contractors couldn ' t be assured of a fair hearing since both the investigators and administrative law judges would be employees of the Defense Department . Derek Vander Schaaf , the Pentagon ' s deputy inspector general , argues that similar adjudicatory procedures have been used successfully at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission , in addition to the medical claims area at the Department of Health and Human Services . Another complaint from the contractors is that the bill doesn ' t require proof that contractors intended to defraud the government . Currently , the bill would deem officials guilty of fraud if they " know or have reason to know " that a claim is false . " There ' s 3 , 000 pages of government regulations in defense contracts , " complains an industry lawyer . A simple mistake could lead to fraud penalties , he says . " If you submit a bill for $1 million and the Pentagon agrees to pay $750 , 000 , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ' t prosecute mistakes , " Mr. Vander Schaaf insists . " We know what ' s a fraudulent claim and so do the contractors . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
