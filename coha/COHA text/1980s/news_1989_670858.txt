Most tours package air , ground or sea transportation and accommodations , and many also include meals , sightseeing and other activities. // Many people like packaged tours because of the fixed costs , convenience and peace of mind they offer . But for most travelers , the biggest advantage of a package tour is a much lower price than they would pay if they bought the same services separately . <> <> Savings of 25 Percent // " If you tore apart all the pieces of the tour , you would find you would spend more money on your own , " said Edward N.

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To check on credibility , call your local Better Business Bureau and inquire whether there have been any complaints against the tour operator . Ask the operator for names of people who took the tour that you are considering . Find out if the tour company is a member of the National Tour Association , which has a consumer-protection plan that provides full or partial reimbursement to consumers when one of its member companies goes bankrupt. // The terms and conditions page contains many of the contractual aspects of the tour . Experts in the field say the page tries to relieve the tour operator from responsibility for certain problems that could arise during the trip . If the terms and conditions seem unreasonable , find another tour. // A key point to consider among the conditions in the fine print is the possibility of price changes after making a deposit , or even after making full payment for the tour. // " The brochures always seem to say , ' Prices subject to change , ' " said Lorna Greene , a travel agent with Reliable Travel in Cedarhurst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tour rises more than 15 percent and you are not given an acceptable reason , you should cancel. // Of course , there may be charges for canceling , which ought to be explained in the tour brochure .
