Germany , and New York . Hundreds of Kafka fans showed up at Sotheby 's just for a glimpse of the yellowed pages covered with Kafka 's elegant script . It was clear from the start that few public institutions or university libraries could afford to bid . " We have n't got that sort of money , " said Oxford 's Sir Malcolm Pasley , who took the other manuscripts from Zurich to the Bod ? leian nearly 30 years ago . The Japanese , whose appetite for Western arts seems insatiable , were only a remote possibil ? ity : the manuscript is n't much to hang on the wall . In fact , the most likely buyers appeared to be the Germans . Mar ? ianna Steiner , one of Kafka 's nieces , who now lives in London , was n't planning to attend the auction as it would have been too painful to see the manuscript go to a private collector . But she changed her mind at the last minute . If a collector bought it , the 75-year-old Steiner wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sale , inside Sotheby 's impossibly proper auction room , ten television cameras were lined up on one wall , faced on the other side by a phalanx of print journalists , many of them chattering in German . Frau Hoffe was nowhere to be seen . The auction began with poems by Brecht , postcards from Hitler , and a letter from Dostoyevsky . None went for more than ? 12,500 . Then came Kafka 's ? or rather , Frau Hoffe 's ? turn . Bidding started at a mere ? 400,000 and , within 32 seconds , three bidders in the room had nodded and twitched their way to a million . When the gavel finally descended , dozens of reporters assailed the successful bidder , a beefy West Ger ? man book dealer named Heribert Tenschert . Cagey at first , Tenschert finally allowed that he had bought the manuscript on behalf of the German govern ? ment , with Federal Republic money , and that it was to be deposited at the German Literary Archive in Marbach . Marbach is where the literary remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are kept . It 's an idea that takes some getting used to . Not only was the Holocaust , in some ways , The Trial writ large , but it was n't until after 1945 that Kafka became known in German-speaking countries . " They burned his three sis ? ters and now they make him a national hero , " said Kafka biographer Ernst Pawel . Ulrich Ott , the soft-spoken direc ? tor of the Marbach archive , who had been bidding against Tenschert to convince spectators that Tenschert had been acting privately , was prepared for such criticism . Ott said the institute has a duty to preserve German writing , and he 's eager to put out a facsimile edition of the manuscript . Tenschert was defensive . " Perhaps it escaped you that he wrote in German , " he snapped back at one reporter . For her part , Marianna Steiner , who said Kafka taught her Hebrew when she was a young girl , said she was relieved to see it go to a place accessible to scholars . And Sir Malcolm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of Kafka 's work . He 's already spent days upstairs at Sotheby 's , matching the pages ' watermarks to determine their proper sequence , noting how various sections of the manuscript have yel ? lowed , and determining where Kafka 's handwriting is smaller in some places than in others . KATIE HAFNER Katie Hafner is a staff editor at Business Week . MRS . THATCHER has joined Doonesbury in declaring the cold war over . Uncharacteristically , she is wrong . Such thinking is wishful until the Soviets leave not just Afghanistan but Central America , until they not only talk about " defensive sufficiency " but practice it by making real cuts in defense spending and by reconfigur ? ing their offensive force structure in Europe . What can be said with confidence , however , is something more mod ? est , but still highly significant : for the first time in the postwar period it is possible to foresee an end to the cold war ? on Western terms . That can happen in one of two ways , by means of Soviet reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gorbachev has begun , it is conceivable that in the foresee ? able future the U.S.S.R. will have been transformed into a merely authoritarian one-party state , not terribly more illiberal than most of the 19th-century monarchies . If they reform to the point where they become much like us , or at least much unlike what they were , then the point of the cold war is over . The Soviet Union becomes Russia , a big power like any other , and the 20th-century struggle of ideologies reverts to a 19th-century struggle of great pow ? ers . Not a guarantee of peace , by any means , but a relief from the prospect of unending , irreconcilable hostility . The other possibility is that.perestroika fails , and the Sovi ? ets revert to their old ways . If so , the old system will likely not be able to sustain itself and certainly not be able to sustain a policy of imperial expansion . The Soviets seem acutely aware of this . Shevardnadze 's famous speech to the Foreign Ministry , in which he claimed that class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , contained a much overlooked remark : " The idea , which gained a firm hold in the minds and deeds of certain strate ? gists , that the Soviet Union could be as strong as any possible coalition of states opposing it is absolutely groundless . . . . We can not , said Mikhail Sergeyevich , per ? mit ourselves the luxury of ' imitating ' the United States , NATO , and Japan in all their military technical novelties . " The Soviets know that their historic achievement of the last 40 years ? being able to match a coalition of the great ? est powers in history : the United States , Britain , France , Germany , and Japan ? is slipping out of their reach . Soviet rethinking on this score is not due to any great soul-searching . It is merely a response to objective reality . The Soviets thought that they had really turned the corner in the 1970s . The United States had been defeated , humili ? ated , and riven by Vietnam . The economies of the West had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting economic and political demoralization produced annus mirabilis 1979 . In that single year , the United States was thrown out of Iran and the Soviets or their proxies seized power in Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Cambodia , and , just for spite , Grenada . Which is what made the economic and geopolitical resur ? gence of the West in the ' 80s all the more shocking . Infla ? tion was checked , the oil shock overcome , Euromissiles were deployed , the arms race was reignited ( with the now added strain of SDI ) , and the new outposts of the Soviet empire were challenged by local insurgencies armed and backed by the Reagan Doctrine . Any thought the Soviets might have had of unilaterally outflanking the West either economically or geopolitically has evaporated . Gorbachev is the Soviet way of coming to terms with that reality . But that means only that we are winning the cold war , not that it is over . Indeed , declaring it over or being willing to offer the other guy a draw is one way of blowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic resurgence , by launching an arms race that the Soviets have had great trouble matching , the United States has convinced the Soviets that , if things continue , they can no longer win the twilight struggle . As the Soviets sue for peace in the cold war , we should examine the terms , and , so long as they are ungenerous ( to them , that is ) , accept them . OUR FIRST TASK then is to see the cold war to a suc ? cessful conclusion . Our second is to figure out what to do next . It is not too early to begin preparing ourselves for the challenges that lie beyond the Soviet threat and that for decades necessarily and correctly had to be subordinated to it . Three challenges in particular deserve close attention . 1 . A new strategic environment . With extraordinary rapidity , a confluence of three elements ? missiles , gas , and " crazy states " ? is producing a new strategic environment . Small , unstable , and reckless states ( such as Libya and Iraq ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on them . Today it is the poor man 's bomb , poison gas . Tomorrow it will be the rich man 's bomb , too . As nuclear technology becomes cheaper and smaller , acquiring it will not require being so rich anymore . Had Israel not practiced its own brand of nuclear non ? proliferation on Iraq in 1981 , the Gulf War could easily have gone nuclear . It did , after all , go chemical . Missile technology is proliferating even more rapidly . With the acquisition of long-range delivery systems , it is quite conceivable that in the next decade and certainly in the next century , countries of the size and inclination of , say , Iran could become a menace not just to regional peace ( they are now ) but to world peace . The more immediate threat to the safety of Western countries will come not from the massive arsenal of the Soviet Union but from the smaller arsenals of radical states armed with missiles , gas , and unappeasable grievances . The current approach to these problems , non-proliferation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than temporarily stop the spread of advanced tech ? nology . These states have the means and the will to get what they want . Nor does President-elect Bush 's plan for a ban on the production and stockpiling of chemical weap ? ons hold out much promise . As Douglas Feith points out , this year Iraq did not just produce chemical weapons , it used them . It killed 5,000 people in a day , an event that was reported in all the world 's media ? and produced almost no reaction . If the use of poison gas brings no sanction , what possible fear could a country have of breaking some new international convention prohibiting its mere production ? THERE ARE ONLY two solutions of sorts . First is a new echnology of defense by which the rich powers keep a few decades ahead of the smaller powers by perfecting smart anti-missile weapons of defense . The bipartisan sup ? port in the United States for anti-tactical ballistic missiles ( ballistic missiles that shoot down short-range rockets ) shows the growing recognition of the imminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American deploy ? ment of any space defense in the next decade or two , it will almost certainly be too thin and crude to defend against an attack by another great power . Its most useful application might be to defend against a limited attack by a crazy state . The other approach is post-facto non-proliferation , taking its cue from the Israeli solution to the Iraqi nuclear threat . It is in the interest of all the great powers to pre ? vent lunatic states from threatening world peace through the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them . An agenda for the future is true international policing of laws prohibiting the use and perhaps even the acquisition of such weapons and/or de ? livery systems . Sanctions might begin with economic measures . But a credible military threat ? e.g. , pre-emp ? tion with remotely fired smart weapons ? might be the only truly effective deterrent . 2 . Global pollution . Through the ' 70s , and in response to continued on page 18 the oil shocks , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made much sense in a world in which substitution and conservation are economic princi ? ples that need only the free market to work . The real prob ? lem that the market can not solve ? because those responsi ? ble do not bear the cost ? is transnational pollution . The industrialization of the developing world , particu ? larly such giants as China , India , and Brazil , will greatly compound the problem of global pollution . Foremost among these is the greenhouse effect , one doomsday sce ? nario that even a confirmed anti-apocalypticist like myself takes seriously . The evidence , after all , is not speculative . The globe has warmed by one degree in the last century , with most of it coming in the last 20 years . The four hottest years of the 20th century have occurred in one decade ? this one . Burning fossil fuels is too primitive a way for a civilization as advanced as ours to produce energy . And the atmosphere can not safely accommodate all the burning that it will take to industrialize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce carbon dioxide emissions cooperatively . And they are go ? ing to have to use great pressure to curb pollution by others . The burning of the Amazon forest alone accounts for a tenth of world carbon dioxide production . It may take extreme economic inducements or extreme economic sanc ? tions against the new polluters like Brazil to impress upon them the benefits of environmental self-restraint ( a bur ? den that the West did not have to bear during its earlier rush to industrialize ) . 3 . Supersovereignty . The supersession of the nation-state and its integration into something larger and loftier is not a new idea . Until now , however , it has been an utterly utopi ? an one . Our dismal experience with the United Nations , moreover , shows how wasteful and mischievous such pre ? mature utopianism can be . A parliament of man that unites the United States with , say , Libya and Sri Lanka can at best be useless . The integration , even the forced equality , of nations so divided by history , values , technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense . The great promise of the next century , however , is the integration of the like-minded , democratically organized , highly industrialized states of the West . Europe is the model . Its economic integration by 1992 is rapidly reaching a point of no return . Too rapidly for some . Margaret Thatcher has already launched a counterattack in defense of national sovereignty ? a defense that shows how clear is the threat posed by the coming economic integration of Europe . Common markets lead to central banks which lead to common currency which leads to common economic policy which can ultimately lead to a common politics . The integration of the West is occurring as well at the pre-political levels of technology and culture . The satellite dishes linking Tokyo and Los Angeles and the fiberoptic cables linking New York and Paris are establishing the neu ? ral network of the future West . And where hardware goes , software must follow . The relatively free flow of capital , goods , and ideas has already produced economies so inter-linked that unilateral economic decision-making is becom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion is now a simple necessity , and , as an embryonic finance committee of the West , an indication of things to come . We may well be in a period akin to that encountered by the French feudal kingdoms of the late Middle Ages , the Amer ? ican states in the 18th century , and the German and Italian city-states of the 19th ? periods in which national progress meant finding ways to devise a more perfect union . Sestanovich 's Law ( named after its Sovietologist inven ? tor ) says that countries that talk about interdependence ? the United States in the ' 70s , the Soviets today ? are in decline . That is certainly true for interdependence involv ? ing countries that are wholly alien or even hostile to you . Interdependence with a stranger or an enemy is rightly considered at best a confession of mere dependence or at worst an attempt at appeasement . Interdependence with friends and allies , however , is not a symbol of decline . If it is a route to greater unity , it is a route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the emerging nation-state . The ultimate challenge awaiting us , if and when the Soviet threat recedes , is the integration of Europe , North America , and the Pacific Rim in a grand confederation of democracies . That will , of course , mean that America will no longer be No. 1 . That is nothing to lament . If and when the Soviet threat recedes , there will be no need for an America that is No. 1 , i.e. , an America with the over ? whelming strength to act unilaterally to defend the free world . America 's historic role of saving the West after World War II will have been achieved . Being No. 1 , after all , is not an end in itself . It must be in the service of something . Leading the West into some higher confedera ? tion , even at the expense of American pre-eminence , seems a worthy enough end of American power in a post-Soviet era . IRONICALLY , however , the decline of the Soviet threat might impair the solidarity and arrest the inte ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away one , and they find another . This is not so much a psycho ? logical principle as a political principle . Parties and coun ? tries need mobilizing symbols of " otherness " to energize the nation and to give it purpose . After World War II , the enemy was not hard to find . It was consensually and correctly defined as Soviet commu ? nism . With the Vietnam War , the question of parking one 's hostility became acute for a large number of Ameri ? cans who had shed their inordinate fear of communism . Their hostility was turned to other sources of evil in the world , what might be called the ugly friends : Chile , Korea , the Philippines , the Shah 's Iran and Somoza 's Nicaragua . One way or another , the villains are now almost all gone . What to do now that fascism and its little variants are experiencing a historical twilight ? The answer is to be found in the 1988 Democratic campaign where Richard Gephardt first discovered the political potency of bashing allies . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were featuring the flag of the Rising Sun . A new foil for a redefined American nationalism , a new set of villains had been identified : not right-wing dictators , but prosper ? ous democratic trading partners . This ingenious maneu ? ver ? changing the identity of The Enemy from Soviet communists to Third World thugs to our Asian allies ? allowed Democrats to tap back into American nationalism . John Connally was only ahead of his time when he said in 1979 that if the Japanese did n't shape up they had better be prepared to sit on the docks of Yokahama in their little Datsuns staring at their own little TV sets . The recent Canadian election campaign has shown how emotional and powerful an issue economic nationalism can be . As the Soviet threat declines we can expect the bashing of trading partners to increase as politicians look for new ways to define nationalism and exploit its appeal . This will not advance the project of Western integration . It is likely that , as the cold war draws to an end , the world will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power : Russia , China , Europe , America , and Japan . But there is the opportunity in the coming decades for evolution to a grander system : a unipolar system centered on an integrated West of Western Europe , North America , Japan , and with some of the newly industrialized states perhaps joining as well . Radiating from the center wouldbe what might be called the de-socializing states ( China , Russia , Eastern Europe ) , increasingly finding themselves in a condition of economic and technological dependency on the West . To the extent that they reform ? free up prices , enterprise , human energies , and freedoms ? they become less dependent , but more Western and thus less threaten ? ing . It is even conceivable that part of the communist world , Eastern Europe , for example , could progressively become integrated in the Western system through such mechanisms as the IMF , GATT , and even the EEC . This is all blue-sky thinking , of course , until the cold war ends and we have won . And it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory now that it is in sight for the first time since World War II . But as V-CW Day approaches , we should have the confidence to start think ? ing about the new world on the other side . Vietnam buried the notion of Pax Americana . But America 's recovery from Vietnam abolished the brief communist fantasy of a Pax Sovietica . If we intelligently manage Western integration and resist the more mindless forms of nationalism that are trying to substitute for postwar anti-communism , the next century holds out the promise of a Western Peace as global and secure as any that we have known before .
