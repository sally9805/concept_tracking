Consumed by wanderlust as a young art student , he went to Europe and promptly fell in with the likes of Picasso and Rousseau . He returned home just in time to paint the start of the Mexican Revolution . A committed Marxist , he went to Moscow , brushes in hand , to capture the pageantry of the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution . And in 1930 , with the Great Depression unfolding amid intense political ferment , Rivera and his artist-wife , Frida Kahlo , paid their first visit to the United States. // The trip was the beginning of a stormy affair between the irresistibly charming , 300-pound artist and the American public , which is chronicled in " Rivera in America , " a documentary to be broadcast on public TV ' s American Masters series tomorrow night at 9 on Channel 13 . The hourlong film , narrated by the **25;110833;TOOLONG Luis Valdez ( he directed the recent film " La Bamba " ) and written and directed by Rick Tejada-Flores , an independent producer specializing in Hispanic themes , tells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the Americans who worked with him , posed for him and , in one case , literally opened doors for him. // It also includes a tantalizing clue to the roots of a major cause celebre in American art history : Rivera ' s run-in with the Rockefeller family in 1933 over his refusal to remove a likeness of Lenin from a fresco they had commissioned for Rockefeller Center. // Rivera , by then renowned for his monumental frescos depicting the history of Mexico , was eager to work in a major industrial nation where his paintings , displayed on the walls of great public buildings , could celebrate and inspire the struggle of the workers . Between 1930 and 1941 - when he returned to Mexico - he painted large murals in San Francisco , Detroit and New York . In 1931 , a one-man retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art electrified critics. // " All art is propaganda , " the artist can be heard declaiming solemnly in Spanish at the beginning of the film .

Now we can just admire his colors , his composition , his draftsmanship. ' // " Well , " the 43-year-old film maker said , " I didn ' t like that idea , because I think that Rivera , more than anyone else I can think of , is someone in whom you can not separate the content from the style . His work is his art , and his art is his message . I wanted to make that point very clearly. " // Mr. Tejada-Flores , whose father is Bolivian and who grew up in southern California , said that he first became aware of Rivera ' s work while a student at the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His journey of discovery began in Mendocino , Calif. , in 1963 , during a summer job making prints for a graphic artist named Emmy Lou Packard . Miss Packard , now in her 70 ' s , had been one of the struggling young artists Rivera hired to mix his pigments and prepare the plaster walls for painting. // " After I decided to do the film , Emmy helped me get in touch with a lot of the other people , " Mr. Tejada-Flores said , including the artists Steve Dimitroff and his wife , Lucienne Bloch ( daughter of the Swiss composer Ernst Bloch ) ; the architect Michael Goodman ; Ella Wolfe , widow of Bertram D. Wolfe , Rivera ' s biographer , and the photographer Peter Stackpole - who can be seen in one of Rivera ' s murals as a boy holding a model airplane . Mr. Stackpole ' s father , the sculptor Ralph Stackpole , was one of the artist ' s longtime friends. // Mr. Tejada-Flores had no difficulty convincing his subjects to reminisce on camera. // " They were delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Most of the people I interviewed are political people , committed public artists who were inspired by him 50 years ago - and though the art world has changed very much since then , a lot of them still believe in his vision of art and society. " // To start his two-and-a-half years of research , Mr. Tejada-Flores began in San Francisco , where he lives . Rivera ' s first two American commissions were for frescos in that city , one at the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange Luncheon Club , the other at the California School of Fine Arts , now the San Francisco Art Institute . Although their themes are nonpolitical , neither fresco is widely known. // " The one he did for the Art Institute was covered up all during the 50 ' s partly because it wasn ' t abstract , and partly because Rivera was a Communist , " Mr. Tejada-Flores said. // At the Stock Exchange Club , where the film maker found an elderly Chinese doorman who does a wonderfully engaging imitation of the Rivera belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - remains out of public view. // " I had never seen it before , " Mr. Tejada-Flores said . " It ' s in a private building , and only members are allowed in . The irony is that here we have Rivera ' s first work in the United States , a man committed to public art , and his first mural is for a private club at the Stock Exchange. " // There were other ironies in Rivera ' s American travels , not the least of which were who he accepted as his other patrons - namely , the Fords and the Rockfellers. // The mural " Detroit Industry " was commissioned in 1932 by the reclusive Henry Ford , who , rather than leave his Dearborn estate , kept tabs on the artist ' s progress by hiring a cameraman to film Rivera at work . Mr. Tejada-Flores found 13 , 000 feet of the footage in the National Archives and included excerpts in his documentary. // The Rockeller Center episode in May 1933 still stands as the nadir of Rivera ' s experiences in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , the Rockefeller family hired him to paint a 63-foot-by-17-foot fresco in the main lobby of the new R.C.A. Building . But some months into the project , which Rivera titled " Man at the Crossroads , " the Rockefellers were reportedly horrified to discover that he had included the figure of Lenin , who was depicted in an almost beatific pose , surrounded by adoring workers. // Rivera , politely ordered by the young Nelson Rockeller to paint Lenin out , refused - although he offered to add Lincoln as a compromise . He was sent packing with the balance of his $21 , 500 commission . The incident provoked a huge outcry against the Rockefellers , which grew louder after it became public that the mural had been destroyed . During his research , Mr. Tejada-Flores , poring over Ralph Stackpole ' s papers in the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley , came across a letter dated December 1932 , suggesting that the original inclusion of Lenin had not been Rivera ' s idea at all , but that of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , a man identified as Clifford Wight , who worked for Rivera in Detroit , wrote that " Mrs. J. D. Jr. said that he didn ' t give Communism enough importance and asked him to include a portrait of Lenin. " // Mr. Tejada-Flores says the need to keep " Rivera in America " to 60 minutes prevented him from exploring the implications of the letter more fully . But he believes that while Mrs. Rockefeller may have urged Lenin ' s inclusion , it was definitely Rivera ' s idea to go beyond the original sketch ( which shows a more inconspicuous Lenin in a cap ) and move the more prominent , bareheaded likeness closer to the mural ' s center. // In the film , Lucienne Bloch suggests that Rivera made Lenin more conspicuous after reading an article in The World-Telegram reporting that Communist artists thought he was " pulling his punches " with the Rockefellers . " He was going to prove to them that he wasn ' t afraid of any capitalist , " Miss Bloch says. // In any case , Rivera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy , Mr. Tejada-Flores said . " Their position was that a picture of Lenin would make it harder to rent the building . And office space was already a hard sell in 1933. " // " Rivera in America " leaves the impression that " Man at the Crossroads " may have been deliberately destroyed - " blasted from the wall , " as the narratorputs it . In fact , Mr. Tejada-Flores said , there is reason to Suspect that Nelson and his mother tried to save it , possibly for the Museum of Modern Art . The fresco ' s destruction , he added , may have ocurred either as workmen tried to remove it intact - or after the Rockefellers realized that it could not be removed without being destroyed. // Jose Alfaro , who was an unemployed auto worker when he met Rivera , recalls in the documentary an episode in which the artist seemed delighted that the city ' s Catholics were up in arms over a panel in " Detroit Industry " that depicted a quasi-Nativity scene. // " Listen , muchacho , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small , is worthless " if it has no critics. " // " It ' s a very telling remark , " Mr. Tejada-Flores said . " All his life , you see a pattern of Rivera trying to create some little incident . And I think what happened in Rockefeller Center is that he just misjudged it - he created a big incident instead of a little one. " //
