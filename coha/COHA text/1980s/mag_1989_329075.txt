After a marathon journey of twelve years and more than 4 billion miles , the remarkable Voyager 2 space probe is finally approaching its last port of call . Having made historic flybys of Jupiter in 1979 , Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986 , it is poised for an Aug. 24 rendezvous with Neptune , the most distant of the giant planets . ( It will not encounter Pluto , whose bizarre orbit now places it closer to the sun than Neptune is . ) Voyager 's aging cameras and electronic sensors are somewhat impaired , and the probe is so distant that its signals take four hours to travel to earth . Still , scientists expect mounds of fresh data and some 8,000 photographic images , entirely new information about a little known object that is almost four times the size of earth but appears in earthly telescopes only as a fuzzy blue-green ball . <P> Though Voyager is still about 22 million miles from Neptune , it has already made several discoveries . It has found a new moon to add to the known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is between 125 and 400 miles across and has a surprisingly ordinary orbit . Like most moons , 1989-N1 orbits nearly over its planet 's equator and in the same direction as the planet 's rotation , implying that it formed with or soon after Neptune . <P> By contrast , Triton , which is about the size of earth 's moon , orbits in the opposite direction . That has led astronomers to guess that Triton might be a large asteroid that was captured by Neptune 's gravity . Such an intrusion should have disrupted the paths of any existing moons . This would explain tiny Nereid 's highly elongated and tilted orbit . But 1989-N1 is just " sitting there , " says Voyager project scientist Torrence Johnson , of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . Johnson expects that the probe will discover more moons , shedding light on Triton 's origins . " All of the outer planets have lots of junk around them , " he notes . Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus have at least 15 moons apiece . " It would be amazing if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things . " <P> Like Jupiter and Saturn , but unlike its near-twin next-door neighbor , Uranus , Neptune appears to have distinct weather patterns . The probe 's cameras have glimpsed a streak of white that may be an atmospheric jet stream , longitudinal bands that could mark prevailing winds , and a dark blotch , perhaps similar to Jupiter 's ancient high-pressure system known as the Great Red Spot . Neptune , Jupiter and Saturn all generate more heat than they receive from the sun , while Uranus does not ; the excess heat may be the source of the turbulence . <P> Another focal point of scientific interest is Neptune 's rings . Indirect evidence suggests that they exist , but as arcs rather than true rings . Voyager 's photographs may help explain how they formed . The space probe will also examine reddish Triton , whose methane atmosphere is believed to overlie a surface puddled with liquid nitrogen .
