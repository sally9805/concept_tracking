' ' There are costume rugs as well as costume jewelry , ' ' says Tom Chatalbash of Fine Arts Rug Inc. in Brookline , Mass . People get taken in by the generic name ' Oriental , ' and they think they are covered by a blanket policy . But not every rug by that name has the qualities that make a great Oriental rug great. ' ' // There are not only many grades of authentic Orientals on the market , but a multitude of copies as well . Rugs marketed as ' ' Oriental design , ' ' for example , are not the genuine article but a machine-made domestic version . A glowing advertisement for ' ' imported rugs ' ' is also not a guarantee that they are handmade. // Another factor to consider is whom you buy from . Harold Keshishian , an Oriental rug expert and member of the board of trustees of the Textile Museum in Washington , D.C. , who participates in two family-owned Oriental rug shops , says there has been a ' ' dramatic increase ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , possibly three times as many now as there were 10 years ago. // With so many newcomers to the trade , it is especially important to seek out a knowledgeable and reputable dealer . In the Oriental rug business , Mr. Keshishian says , the old phrase often holds true : ' ' The item you buy is no better than the person you buy it from. ' ' // Although the market is currently down for Oriental rugs , top quality new rugs are in demand , and collectors are paying stiff prices for rare antique rugs in good condition. // At a recent auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet , a small pentagonal Turkoman rug , originally used as a decorative trapping to go on the side of a camel , sold for $44 , 000 . A premier of its type , the rug had unusual coloring and design , was dated before 1800 , and was in excellent condition . At Skinner ' s in Boston , a pictorial Dagestan rug from the Caucausus , dated 1795 , sold for $28 , 000. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' ' only the very best are making it. ' ' // The value of an Oriental rug , whether it is new , used , or antique , depends on several factors , including the quality of the wool , the tightness of the weave , the color , and the artistry of the design. // ' ' The most important element in buying a new rug is the quality of the wool , ' ' says Tom Chatalbash . In judging wool , a rule of thumb is , ' ' The higher the sheen , the nicer the nap . ' ' A high-grade wool rug results from long hairs twisted together to create smooth , strong yarn . Good wool is also resilient and will bounce back when you crush it in your hand . Any fuzz on the surface of a carpet indicates inferior wool with yarns made from short , dry hairs that pull apart easily. // Chinese rugs are known for the superior quality of their wool , which makes them ' ' virtually indestructible , ' ' as Albert Mahfuz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese factory methods have not changed significantly from the last century to modern times , and the product , dealers say , has remained consistently excellent. // Chinese rugs are a very good buy on today ' s market . Duty dropped from 45 percent to 8 percent on top quality rugs and from 30 percent to under 8 percent for middle-range rugs imported to the US when China was granted favored-nation status in January 1980 . A new 9-by-12-foot Chinese rug usually runs between $1 , 200 and $2 , 500 ; a comparable fine-quality Persian starts around $8 , 000 and can easily reach five figures. // In addition to the wool , another gauge of quality in a rug is the tightness of the weave , which is measured in the number of knots per square inch . Today , 400 knots per square inch is considered fine knotting , whereas antique rugs may have 600 or more . Dense knotting not only extends the lifetime of the rug , but is also a tangible measure of workmanship. // Compare rugs next to each other , Mr. Chatalbash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are seen side by side. // While handling a rug is crucial to judging the wool and the weave , it ' s a good idea to step back to get the full impact of a rug ' s coloring . Most antique rugs , which were made with vegetable dyes , have a lustrous patina developed over time that can not be duplicated with the newer chemical dyes. // ' ' You get a very nice ambiance from an old rug with wonderful color , ' ' Mr. Chatalbash says . In home decorating , the glow of an antique rug not only works well in a period room , but can take the edge off a pristine contemporary setting. // New rugs offer a wider latitude in color than the traditional crimson and indigo backgrounds of Persian rugs , although Mr. Chatalbash points out that some turn-of-the-century rugs were made in ' ' unheard-of colors. ' ' // Most new rugs are made with chemical dyes , which are generally more fast and do not mellow the same way as a vegetable dye . Cheap , unstable dyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , at worst , bleed the first time the rug hits water . Analine dyes seem to be the sturdiest , says Harold Keshishian , but do not ' ' have the intangible quality that old vegetable dyes enjoy. ' ' // People shopping for an Oriental rug are often looking for a certain color , line , and feeling . In broad geographical terms , Caucasian rugs , made in the region between the Black and Caspian Seas , and Turkoman rugs favor bold , rectilinear designs and elaborate borders . Persian rugs ( or Iranian if made after 1937 ) are known for curvilinear , intricate floral patterns . Turkish rugs often feature a pointed prayer arch . Buddhist and Tao symbols are the primary Chinese rug motifs. // A less expensive alternative to a knotted Oriental rug is an Indian dhurry or Romanian kilim - flat-woven rugs in which the design appears on both sides . These rugs feature animals , birds , trees , and flowers , and are popular for their contemporary colors. // Specific rugs are named after the city or district where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . The value of a rug goes up when its design or color is unusual for the town or area in which it was made . A black Chinese rug , for example , is rare and will cost more than a comparable rug dyed in the characteristic blues , yellows , or apricots. // Whether to buy an old or a new rug depends on its purpose . Antique rugs have been dignified by museum exhibitions and have many desirable qualities , but they may not always be the best choice. // A young family with children that wants to buy rugs instead of carpeting would probably be better off buying a new rug , says Mr. Keshishian . Unlike worn antique rugs , which tend to be thin , new Oriental rugs are in good condition , have a thick nap , and have many years of wear ahead of them. // On the other hand , as Albert Mahfuz points out , antique rugs have stood the test of time . They have been washed many times , and you don ' t have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas can be restored by a rug weaver. // On a more esoteric level , one advantage of an antique rug is its individuality . Although classical Persian designs have been repeated since the time of Shah Abbas the Great in the 16th century , each antique rug is different , if only by small nuances in the design . New rugs are more apt to be one of a programmed genre. // ' ' The essential difference between a new rug and an old one is its character , ' ' says Mr. Chatalbash . ' ' But if you don ' t know how to read it , it ' s useless. ' ' // That is where research comes in . Books such as ' ' The Persian Carpets , ' ' by A. Cecil Edwards , and other sources available at a public library give good background information . But dealers agree the best way to learn about Oriental rugs is to visit shops , museums , and galleries to train your eye and become more knowledgeable . Find dealers who will spend some time to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can contact ; the Textile Museum ( 2320 S Street , NW , Washington D.C. , 20008 ) can give you the address of a rug society in your area. // If all else fails , as one dealer put it , ' ' You lose a lot of money , like I did , and you learn very fast. ' ' // //
