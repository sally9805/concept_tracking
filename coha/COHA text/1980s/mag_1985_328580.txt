After taking a snooze during the winter , the U.S. economy now appears ready to shake off its lethargy and get moving again . That was the optimistic forecast of TIME 's Board of Economists , which met last week in Washington . The members see the U.S. economy growing at a solid 3% annual rate for the rest of the year . <P> For the past few months , American business has been close to comatose , and fears of recession have been increasing . The Commerce Department reported last week that the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation , grew at an annual rate of only .7% during the first three months of the year . That was down sharply from the 4.3% gain in the final quarter of 1984 . In addition , corporate profits are off , capital spending is sagging and unemployment is stuck at 7.3% . <P> But new signs that the Federal Reserve Board is easing monetary policy and letting interest rates fall have raised expectations that the economy will avoid a recession and rebound rapidly . Said Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Kennedy Administration : " The Fed is riding to the rescue . " Agreed Alan Greenspan , who served as chief economic adviser to President Ford : " The odds definitely favor a quickening of the economy . " <P> The Federal Reserve signaled its intention to ease credit two weeks ago when it dropped the discount rate , which is the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks and savings institutions , from 8% to 7 1/2% , the lowest level in almost seven years . That spurred most major banks to reduce the prime rate they levy on business loans from 10 1/2% to 10% . This action will help many businesses finance expansion plans and may also lead to lower interest on some consumer loans . TIME 's economists forecast that the prime rate will fall at least another notch , to 9 1/2% , before leveling off . M.I.T. Professor Lester Thurow predicted that the prime rate will decline to 8% by the end of the year . <P> The drop in interest rates energized Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first business day after the discount rate cut , the Dow Jones industrial average surged 19.54 points to finish at a record 1304.88 , its first close above the 1300 barrier . The bulls tacked additional 4.82 points onto the Dow average on Tuesday , lifting it to a new peak of 1309.7 . At that point the market began suffering from one of its recurrent afflictions : acrophobia . Investors started cashing in some of their profits , sending the Dow back down . The industrial average finished the week at 1301.97 . <P> Economic growth would have been much stronger in the first quarter were it not for a torrent of imports , which added to an international trade deficit that hit a record $123 billion in 1984 . Though Americans spent freely early in the year , they were favoring many foreign goods over domestic products . As a result , production in U.S. factories stagnated . The main reason for the import binge was the strength of the dollar , which until the last few months seemed to be rising inexorably . Between 1980 and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 60% against an average of major currencies . That increase devastated many American manufacturers by making their exports more expensive abroad and imports cheaper in the U.S.
