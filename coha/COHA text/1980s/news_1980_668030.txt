A US District Court jury last night convicted Glenn M. Heller , who sold gasoline for $1.56 a gallon last June at his Beacon Hill Gulf station , of 27 counts of price-gouging . Heller , who will be sentenced Feb. 4 by Judge Rya W. Zobel , faces up to 27 years in prison and $270,000 in fines . The jury of seven men and five women apparently rejected Heller ' s contention that he was following the advice of his lawyer in good faith when he raised gasoline prices . Assistant US Atty . Robert B. Collings said the verdict " vindicates the government ' s position that Heller was willfully selling gas last June at outrageous prices far in excess of the regulations . He could only have raised prices that high because there was a shortage , and I think that ' s what the regulations are for - to prevent someone from taking advantage of a shortage . " The jury deliberated more than seven hours before returning the verdict shortly after 8 p.m . A federal auditor testified that Heller overcharged customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditor said , Heller ' s prices were as much as 70 cents a gallon above the federal maximum . The station on Cambridge street at Charles Circle is open 24 hours a day , seven days a week . Heller , 30 , lives on Beacon Hill and has operated the station since August 1976 . He testified that he raised prices in order to slow demand for gasoline so his supply would last long enough to keep his station open 24 hours a day . " There was no other way I could do it , " he said . Heller said he acted on the basis of the advice of his lawyer , Steven M. Brody . Brody said the regulations did not apply to Heller because of a loophole . The previous operator of the station had gone out of business and the station had been closed three weeks before Heller opened under a new lease from the Gulf Oil Co . Therefore , Brody said , Heller was not bound by the profit margins of the previous proprietor . In her charge to the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his lawyer ' s advice in good faith , even though that advice was erroneous . Zobel said the advice was in fact wrong and the regulations did apply to Heller . But she emphasized that the issue before the jury was whether Heller " willfully violated the law . " " If the defendant honestly and in good faith sought the advice of a lawyer and laid out all the facts before the lawyer and in good faith followed and relied on the lawyer ' s advice , then he can not be convicted of a crime that requires willfulness , even if that advice was incorrect , " she said . In his final argument to the jury , prosecutor Collings said Heller was playing " a cute game . " Collins said Heller acted out of greed , not any honest belief that the regulations did not apply to him . " He took the law into his own hands , " Collings said . " He charged high prices at a time of shortage to make money . " Collings noted that Heller also charged 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road map and required a $10 deposit plus a $2.50- an-hour rental fee for a gasoline can . Defense lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate argued that his client acted in " good faith " following Energy Department procedure by appealing through proper channels , even at one point obtaining a stay of a price rollback order . An Energy Department official in Washington issued the stay of the rollback order , which was issued by the Energy Department office in Boston . " Until someone in authority told him he was wrong he wanted to do it his way . Is that so wrong ? " Silverglate said . By William F. Doherty Globe Staff
