At 3 p.m. on a gorgeous Sunday in June , Simon Geller slouches in an easy chair in his darkened apartment , with the windows closed and a chuck steak in the oven , listening to himself on the radio . At the moment , he is broadcasting the ballet Sylvia , by Leo Delibes , on the station he periodically identifies as " WVCA , 104.9 megahertz , in Gloucester , Massachusetts . " <P> Apart from this announcement and the briefest possible description of the music , Geller says little , which is just as well . His listeners happily acknowledge that he has the least polished delivery in broadcasting . The accent is distinctly north-of-Boston , which suits them fine : the first syllable of the word Gloucester comes out long and glottal , as if the bottom has temporarily dropped out of Geller 's voice . The letter r plays hooky . <P> But that voice , " the Voice of Cape Ann , " is flat and without timbre . His admirers describe it as a deadly monotone or compare it with Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often punctuated by dead air and occasionally interrupted by some terse remark like " The peas are burning . " <P> Geller probably says less than any other broadcaster in America and has more time to say it . On this particular Sunday , as on almost every other day of the week for the past 18 years , he will sit in front of an 8-ft. - high stack of broadcasting gear from 6 a.m. , when the station signs on , until 10 p.m. , when it signs off . WVCA 's studio is atop the Whale-of-a-Wash laundromat . The scrap of paper next to the apartment buzzer says simply WVCA-GELLER . When Geller plans to go to the movies or on an errand , he tells his listeners so : " And now I am closing . I have to go to the doctor . The kidneys or something , I forget . " Then WVCA shuts down till he gets back . <P> Geller , a 66-year-old bachelor , does n't have what you might think of as a radio personality . He is n't just taciturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster . He calls Gloucester " the end of the world " and says he would rather have caught on in New York City . In Gloucester , he says , there is nothing to do but work or have sex . " I do n't have a sex partner , " he adds gloomily , " so I work . " <P> Still , his local following is intensely loyal , sponsoring raffles and fashion shows to benefit WVCA and sending in a steady trickle of contributions , which are not tax deductible . One listener shrugs off the work- sex slur , saying " Some people do both . " Another says Geller has given so much to Gloucester he 's entitled to knock it . <P> What he has given is good music . More than 95% of his airtime is devoted to the classics . He does not waste precious minutes on " garbage , " a category in which he includes news , weather , and the time , among many other things . At WVCA , Geller leads off a typical morning lineup with Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Wagner . He has no knack for pedantry ; it is enough to play the music . When a visitor asks the name of a piece , he replies , " That 's a piano concerto by Bronsart , who you probably never heard of . I do n't know anything about him . A lot of the unknown composers wrote good music . That 's why I have the listeners . " Actually , Geller has given more than music to Gloucester . He is not Magic 106.7 , or Johnny Dark on Quality Rock 103 , but the voice of home .
