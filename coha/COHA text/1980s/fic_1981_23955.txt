SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER Tales of an ivory tickler by Don Asher AT SIXTEEN I was embarking on a course that would admit me to the preeminent cabarets and ballrooms of Boston and San Francisco  --  a piano bench my passkey ? entering via the back doors of assorted waterfront dives , backstreet saloons and turnpike toilets . Tiny 's Carousel , on Route 9 between Worcester and Boston , embodied the middle reaches of the final category . A sign over the bar said , " Our waitresses are ladies of unimpeachable moral character , " and the band , a quartet , featured a Negro on tenor sax who played rings around everyone in town . I later learned that I acquired the job ( following an undistinguished audition ) and held on to it by grace of Tiny 's having come up before my uncle , a fairly well-known Worcester County judge , on an extortion charge . My uncle had given him a small fine and probation , and Tiny was the soul of deference and congeniality throughout my tenure at his club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he 'd say at the slightest provocation . Tiny hired only strippers six feet tall and over . Glamazons , he called them . I believe the coinage originated with Billy Rose at his Diamond Horseshoe . Tiny 's six-footers had names like Belle Adonna , Beryl Bang ! ( exclamation point hers ) , Eve Cherry , and Ginger Rhale . They rarely brought in music , simply asking for " some slow blues " or " any jump tune , medium tempo , ' bout like this " ? snapping a thumb and middle finger in a brisk ellipse  --  or " ' Satin Doll , ' medium-slow , couple choruses , stop time on the bridge ; when I 'm down to the bra and G-string , double time and out . " Tiny , according to my uncle the judge , was a man " of humble origins and acquired manners . " Short and chunky , with a comical rocking motion to his walk , he intoned in a soft , husky voice expressions of civility such as " Happy to be making your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " Try the veal parmigiana , it 'll enliven the palate . " His introductions of the acts were equally florid : " Now for your postprandial pleasure , the pulchritudinous Ginger Rhale ... " The second night of Ginger 's engagement Tiny changed her billiog to " Silverella . " A lissome ebony-skinned beauty ( " I grew up on a boulevard of broken lights , " I overheard her tell a man at the bar ) , she emerged from behind a red velvet curtain in glittering silver headdress and swirling layers of diaphanous mauve and scarlet , tracing a sinuous course between the tables under a pale blue spot to a Fats Waller medley of " Ai n't Misbehavin ' " and " Keepin ' Out of Mischief Now . " Gutbucket tenor and boiling drums propelled the medley through a progression of crescendos , spurring Silverella to impassioned maneuvers  --  now prancing like a thoroughbred mare , now swinging her head to the floor , legs taut as a stork 's , and straightening abruptly with a rapid-fire shimmy of shoulders and switching of hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiment to spin tempestuously from her body in incarnadine streamers . Thundering tom-toms , mingling with the crowd 's raucous exhortations , built to a frenzied pitch , rolling into the climax  --  the blue spot winking out on a vision that stormed the blood : Silverella , throat arched and arms akimbo , revealed in all her extravagant glory but for a phosphorescent coat of silver paint , collarbone to toes ( and this fifteen years before Goldfinger ! ) , shining diabolically in the black light . A hollering , foot-stomping ovation followed her regal exit through the swirling red curtain . She colored my dreams , Silverella , the most erotic fantasies I 've ever known , and she departed before I could muster the courage to speak a word to her . Beryl Bang ! was equally statuesque but more accessible . She had recently graduated from Pembroke , was funny and imaginative , and told me she had perfected her supple feline strut by conjuring a metamorphic image of herself as a Persian cat strolling along the e. top of a fence on a moonlit night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go all the way up ? " 60 inquired a leering businessman as she sauntered past his table ; " All the way to heaven , dearie , " came her over-the-shoulder retort ) , and her raven hair fell like a lace shawl about her shoulders . Toward the end of her engagement I plucked raw courage out of the air : " How about a bite of supper after the last show , Miss Bang ! ? " She wore three-inch spikes ; I was five feet six , and her green gaze , which seemed to descend on me from the eaves , was not unkindly . " Honey , look at me and look at you and tell me what we 're gon na do together . " Strippers , 1 was learning , appropriate for their art the best , bluest , gutsiest tunes of the day , and that year and a half at Tiny 's was probably the happiest time I 've ever known .

This was Guido 's sister , and I would soon become overly familiar with a phrase that she invariably appended to her offhand remarks : " It 's fairly common knowledge , but for the love of God do n't quote me . " At that time you could distinguish the mob-patronized clubs by the preponderance of good-looking women who appeared to be unattached it took an immoderately courageous or naive outsider to find out  --  and middle-aged men in conservative suits . The younger men dressed more elegantly but still along reserved lines  --  dark suits of shiny material and monogrammed white shirts and light-colored silk ties , the sole note of ostentation residing in the cufflinks and tiepins that gleamed opulently in the restrained bar lights . The mobsters enjoyed contemporary music and the kindred arts  --  singing , dancing , comedy . They liked to conduct their business and relax in sleek and animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing a sentimental tune . shiny and opulent cabaret , incongruously situated among the neighborhood groceries , laundries , and pizzerias , and frequented by members of the thriving **27;2489;TOOLONG axis of La Cosa Nostra . I never learned who Vincent was . The manager , whom I 'll call Guido , owned two cocker spaniels , and every night at closing time he 'd set out twin yellow bowls of food on either side of the leather-padded door , beneath the zebra-striped awning . Inside was a black marble fireplace and lots of mirrors on the crimson walls ; from different angles they glittered and flashed with light thrown from the banquettes ' silver and glassware . The bar was separate , a small horseshoe affair called The Paddock , with black glass-top tables and framed photographs of racetracks and horses . In an alcove between the supper room , where I worked , and the bar was a combination coatcheck stand and cigarette counter operated by a pretty , faded woman attired in I BACKED singer Amy Avallone and played solo segments around her . She was a full-bodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( " Honey , I only walk down wide corridors ' cause bruise kinda easy , " I heard her say to an aging mafioso . ) She came in that first night wearing a luxurious fur coat , a monogrammed leather folder under one arm and a blue silk gown over the other ; she dropped the folder on the piano . " Let 's run over my charts before the place fills up . " I glanced through the arrangements ; they were elaborate and overwritten , dense with notes . My reading skill at the time was rudimentary , and to speak frankly , the notation looked about as decipherable as a spattering of bird droppings across a barn wall . " I know most of the tunes ; why do n't we just fake them ? " " I paid good loot for these charts You can read , ca n't you ? " " Let 's save ourselves trouble . Just write out the order with keys and number of choruses . " She leaned her elbows disconsolately on the piano and for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then she muttered something under her breath that sounded like a resigned " What a pity . " When l got to know her better I realized the phrase had been " Shit city . " She opened each of her three nightly sets with " Once in Love With Amy " and closed with some sprightly , maudlin jumper like " Are n't You Glad You 're You ? " ( Ev'ry time you 're near a rose I Are n't you glad you 've got a nose ? ) . The mafiosi ate it up . Part of my job was to boost her to a sitting position on the baby grand a la Helen Morgan , in one of her strapless sheaths ( she wore a different one for every set and a week would elapse before I noticed a repeat ) . A rich and heady perfume came off her throat and shoulders like mist off a still pond , and I 'd retreat from these exquisite exertions reeling . Between her sets I played ballads and show tunes of the day , trying to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellishments , two melodies rendered simultaneously ( Watch this , Alec Templeton ) , and rhythmic variations on sturdy warhorses like " Alexander 's Ragtime Band " what musicians call flagwavers . I thought it would n't hurt to get on the right side of these guys . ( Guido 's sister had told me he 'd tried a pair of strolling fiddlers when the place first opened , " but the clientele was n't all that crazy about the horsehair shafts poking into their lobster Newburg . They lasted three nights and no one 's heard of them since . It 's fairly common knowledge , but for the love of God do n't quote me . " ) What sometimes drifted across my mind as I served up my flagwavers to the blankly pretty women and blunt-featured men was an account I 'd read in National Geographic of primitive Indian tribesmen in the remote upper reaches of the Amazon displaying " extraordinary emotional responses " to a recording of Beethoven 's Violin Concerto . Guido took me aside one night . Unlike his conservatively dressed clientele , he wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Complaints had come his way : people were having trouble recognizing the melody , and a highly esteemed party at a reserved table had remarked that the piano player could n't seem to keep a steady beat  --  sadly mistaking my embroideries for rhythmic instability . " I Iike you , you 're a nice boy , " Guido said . " Amy wishes you 'd use her music , but she 's happier than she was with the last guy . Now , you want to make an old businessman happy ? My friends are simple good-time Charlies , they do n't like a lot of adornment . Knock off the fancy flourishes , cut down the DiMaggios arpeggios . Leave us hear the melody , capisc ' ? " And he drove a short playful right to my midriff and slapped my cheek in a friendly but brisk manner . Later that night an old and battered mafioso approached the piano while I was playing a medley from Oklahoma . His face was deeply seamed , and coarse tufts of gray hair sprouted from the backs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely covering them , then gently pressing them into the dead keys as if he were reluctantly squashing a pair of harmless but repulsive insects ; " The Surrey With the Fringe on Top " went flatter than a doormat . " Play ' Ciao , Ciao , Bambina . ' It 's for my wife . " His voice was a hoarse whisper . " Play it every ten minutes until I tell you to stop . " He raised off my hands , which involuntarily retained their crushed-bug position , and dropped a five-dollar bill on the piano ; it fluttered like an autumn leaf , brushing the keyboard , coming to rest in my lap . To my considerable relief I knew the tune , thanks to my apprenticeship at the Italian-American Social Club two Years earlier and found myself smiling in recollection , thinking " Eat , Eat , Babe Ruth , " which had been an Armenian bass player 's designation for " Ciao , Ciao , Bambina . " Guido wandered in from the bar , grimacing painfully and banging the heel of his palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy surf . " What 's with the same song , you 're sounding like a broken record . " I told him of the unusual request and pointed out the party who had made it . Guido took a look and said , " Keep playing it . " NOW THAT I was reactivating my Italian repertoire and playing unadorned melody , a steady stream of drinks began arriving at the piano . I was drinking an occasional beer at the time but was not yet into the heavy stuff . I tried to cut off the flow ; if a drink was pressed on me or arrived unsolicited I let it stand on the piano until it went flat . Guido noticed this aberration and spoke to me during a break . " It 's not a friendly attitude . " told him if I accepted every drink offered me I 'd be finished by the time I was 62 thirty . ( A piano-bar player I knew in Provincetown handled this problem by announcing at the start of the evening , " As I 'm allergic to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver dollars will do nicely . Thanks a million . " ) Guido gave a sad little smile and laid a parental hand on my shoulder . " Always order the drink . The bartender will send up colored water . Order an Old Fashioned , we 'll load it with fruit , you 'll have yourself a nutritious snack , capisc ' ? " ? followed by the right to the midsection and the friendly slap across the face . I soon began to retch at the sight of maraschino cherries and orange slices . A stranger dropped into the club late one night , an out-of-town boy by the looks of him  --  charcoal suit , checked shirt , white scarf  --  and seeing three untouched Old Fashioneds lined up in front of me , said , " You seem to be overloaded here . " He hefted one and took a generous slug ; a contemplative expression came over his face . " I see Guido 's still pouring the same old swill . " The next night I asked the bartender to substitute gin rickeys sans gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been overly friendly toward me and greeted my request with mute contempt . I think I can safely interpose a blanket judgment here : bartenders are not enamored of musicians . They begrudge us our short hours  --  roughly half theirs ? and our frequent ( union-sanctioned ) intermissions . A businessman at Tiny 's Carousel once tried to buy the band champagne cocktails . The bartender told him , " Pouring champagne for this crew is like feeding a pig strawberries , " and his accompanying smile failed to conceal the underlying rancor . After a month backing Amy Avallone I helped her on with her coat one Saturday night as she was leaving . It was either mink or a class muskrat and gave off a fragrance like a moon-splashed field of jasmine . I opened the door for her and blurted , " How about going somewhere for coffee ? " She glanced at me in a sidelong , questioning way , smiling and frowning at the same time : a low chuckle rose in her throat . " You tired of living ? " I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath pluming in the chill morning , and slide into the front seat of a black Chrysler . A man in a dark , shiny suit sat behind the wheel , smoking . At my feet Guido 's cocker spaniels were scarfing noisily from the twin yellow bowls . The club door opened , and the elderly mafioso who had flattened my hands on the keyboard a week earlier came out . He breathed deeply of the crisp air , buttoning his overcoat . " Guido tells me your name is Asher , " he said in his soft hoarse voice . " That 's right . " " Your father 's the judge ? " " Uncle . " He nodded sagely and gazed down at the busy spaniels ; an almost angelic smile crept over the bulbous , weathered face as he stooped laboriously to fondle one of the golden heads . " I see you dogs 're dining out again tonight , " he whispered . GUYS AND DOLLS and Call Me Madam opened on Broadway , and eighty blocks north Bird and Dizzy were generating lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Boston and was studying with a virtuoso black jazz pianist at the Berklee College of Music ( " You 'll have to pick up your final credits , " he told me , " in the University of the Streets of New York " ) , supporting myself by working with Rudy Yellin 's Society Orchestra . At wedding receptions , when the newlyweds posed with bright grins , their entwined hands gripping the engraved silver knife , we played the year 's hit tune , " If I Knew You Were Coming I 'd 've Baked a Cake . " On a busy Saturday night Rudy would have a dozen or more combos working in the Boston area 's hotels , country clubs , lodges , catering halls , and private homes . From a reservoir or " stable " of musicians he was able to put together units of any size and specification to fit a hostess ' needs . This pool consisted mainly of middle-aged professionals , family men moderate in habit and mien , who could both read and fake . Only in the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always asking musicians if they read or play by ear ; most do both , but this reply for some reason creates consternation , as if an airline captain were to claim to be both pilot and navigator . A Boston colleague of mine responds to all such queries , " I read pretty good but not without moving my lips . " ) Rudy 's stable-boys , as they jocularly or plaintively referred to themselves , gave Rudy first call on all nights in return for a guaranteed annual income . They were steady and dependable ( some had 64 daytime occupations ) , maintained a repertoire of current pop and show tunes , and stuck close to the melody on their choruses . The younger jazz and club-date musicians scorned them as " mickey-mouse " or " ricky-tick " players , but a good many could have acquitted themselves creditably in a Harlem jam session , and their families ate regularly . There is less real music to the society-band business than people think ; or , putting it another way , the music itself is frequently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's depends to a great extent on contacts with banquet and catering managers , club social directors , society leaders , columnists , and other community machers ; this entails constant wining , dining , or alternative forms of cajolery . Competition is keen and bandleaders will often vie for engagements by outfitting their musicians in exotic costumes to fit an ethnic or thematic occasion . It 's the old **29;2518;TOOLONG concept . Theme parties are the bane of the professional musician 's existence , reducing him , in the space of one night , to the level of the meat-market clerk in phosphorescent green vest and paper bow tie on St. Patrick 's Day . With Rudy I found myself working classy hotel rooms and country clubs , attired in striped blazer , Hawaiian shirt ( lei optional ) , serape , Gay Nineties brocaded vest ( with straw boater and sleeve garters ) , balloon-sleeved Greek tunic , coolie shift and hat ( endless choruses of " Slow Boat to China " ) , bowler derby , yarmulke , and accessories coincident to Halloween , Valentine 's Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourth of July . It is the closest the professional musician comes to prostitution , other than playing the parlor upright in a reconstructed New Orleans whorehouse . WITH THE HELP of the more experi-enced stableboys , I soon picked up tricks of the trade : carrying a goose-neck lamp and ex-tension cord on reading jobs ( most music-stand lights wo n't accommodate to pianos ) and a pocket chess set or paperback book for killing time during long-winded after-dinner speeches ; requesting ice water ( heavy on the ice ) from bartenders during breaks , drinking off the water , and replenishing the glass from my coat-concealed half pint for a tasty Southern Comfort on the rocks . From a Filipino busboy , of all people , I learned how to bring a piano 's flat notes up to pitch by strategically wedging folded cocktail napkins between the strings . I 'd lift a cigarette-scorched piano lid and find a note from the previous pianist : " This box is a dirty dog . D and E above high C stick and a couple bass notes do n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't place I pissed in it closing night . " Complaints to management were usually futile . Catering managers and non-jazz club owners did n't want to hear about defective instruments . The piano was invariably " tuned just last week , " or " Out of eighty-eight notes you got eighty-three in working condition ; I wish I could count on that kind of percentage in my end of the business , " or " I 'm sick of spending money on the goddamn thing , next time bring your own " i which a generation of pianists would be doing in the Seventies , trundling electric keyboards and fifty-pound speakers down hotel corridors like latter-day Willy Lomans ) . Keyboards sprinkled with missing notes can take the heart out of you : consider a gardener trying to work with the center teeth missing from his rake . At an after-hours club in Somerville I watched a black pianist dexterously hopscotching a string of nonplaying notes using an aggressive stride technique . He called it his Jack-be-nimble style , developed over the years for dealing with " these rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candlesticks of dead notes . I expressed my sympathy and admiration for his resourcefulness . " There 're times you got to come on like Alexander the Great , " he told me . " You ca n't let the suckers beat you down . " The Brigantine Club in Revere Beach was notorious for its rinky-dink atrocity of a baby grand . Ivories were discolored and chipped or missing altogether ; the felts looked like they had been chewed by crazed rodents ; the strings were coated with a whitish substance that could only be salt ( on balmy nights did invisible sea mists waft through the open windows ? ) ; and the casing was studded with drink rings and cigarette burns . Early in the evening of my first Brigantine gig I punctured my thumb on one of the ragged ivories and began spotting the keys like a gored bullfighter dripping on the sand . I signaled the leader-saxophonist who was playing the lead on " The Night Has a Thousand Eyes " ; he wandered over , blowing as he walked ; gazed at the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , still blowing . ( Musicians are n't easily disconcerted ; they 've undergone too many bizarre experiences , witnessed too much craziness on the stand and out front . I once saw a woman at a drunken Gay Nineties brawl pour a schooner of beer into the bell of the tuba player 's horn . He gazed at her mournfully and kept on blowing  --  it sounded like frogs in a bathtub . ) Between tunes a waitress handed me a bar rag , then quickly backed off . " You contagious ? " she asked from a respectful distance . Naturally , I requested an explanation . " TB , " she said demurely . I said I knew I was thin , but not that thin . " Well , this movie I saw ... " I knew the one she meant and instantly understood : Cornel Wilde as Frederic Chopin coughing gobbets of red onto the gleaming ivories . During the break I bandaged my thumb and began wedging cocktail napkins between the salt-encrusted strings . An intelligent-looking bystander asked what I was doing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gynecologist from Swampscott . In my inquisitive , small-town way I asked him what gynecologists always get asked by frustrated lechers : Do n't you get nervous examining all those beautiful chicks ? His answer was eloquent and instructive ( and possibly rehearsed ) : " My work is like that of the piano repairman who can only afford a modest instrument in his own home . When he hires out to a rich man to work on a magnificent concert grand , he does the best job he can and does not covet it . He understands it is beyond his reach . " I had occasion to return to the Brigantine two months later . Praying that the monstrosity had been replaced , I came fortified with Band-Aids and a liberal stash of Southern Comfort . Black Beauty stood in the window just as I 'd left her , massive , bullying , unassailable . Disheartened , I lifted the top and found , Scotch-taped to the underside , a wry and piquant dissertation by a previous tenant : " This vintage instrument has a storied history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fierce winter of 1857-58 by the craftsman Melinkov of Smolensk . Only small pedigreed animals from the czar 's private preserve had access to its innards during the long nocturnal hours , and even after a century 's lapse their musty fragrance and distinctive nibblings are still detectable . You 'll notice the instrument 's unusual sonority . Careful examination of the casing reveals the czar 's personal crest , an ingenious design of interlocking circles predating this century 's famed Ballantine rings and overlaid with a series of vertical grooves , each , by striking coincidence , approximately the size of an Old Gold . " Bandleaders will sometimes join forces and attempt to shame or coerce managers and proprietors into repairing a derelict . But it is a losing cause : many are beyond salvage and will hold a tuning only so long before reverting to their former primordial state . As Rudy 's first-call trombonist said to the Brigantine 's owner , " Here 's what you should do with this aberration : tune it , clean it thoroughly , refurbish the felts and hammers , polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for firewood . And you know what you 'd have ? " The owner shook his head . " A bad fire . " PARADOXICALLY , I encountered the rottenest tomato of them all at a sumptuous lawn party on a Wellesley estate . " Chinatown " was the motif . Paper lanterns strung in the poplar trees and silvered vessels of barbecued pork , chow mein , et al . warming over burners on red-clothed tables ; a pagoda-roofed bar at one end of the wide lawn . We dressed accordingly : coolie hats and loose-fitting pastel cotton garments , intended , I gathered , to simulate the garb of rice-gathering peasants . Indian summer weather had prevailed for the past two weeks  --  blue and gold days and velvet nights ? but on this night autumn fell like a clanging gate : a brisk fifty-five degrees and a good wind blowing . A half dozen electric heaters had been propped in the crooks of the tall trees . We got out of our tux coats , balled them up , laid them in the drum cases and donned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , fitting the small guys like little girls ' dresses and making our beanpole bass player look like a night heron out of water . I played a trial run on the blond Baldwin spinet and  --  never mind my ears  --  did n't believe my eyes . The keys went down and stayed down like the plug had been pulled on a player piano in mid-tune . With a sinking heart I took off the front and set it on the grass . The hammers I had struck were cocked back against the strings as if glued there , yet the tripping mechanisms and felts all appeared in good condition . I called over trumpeter-leader Tommy Tedesco , who was alternately blowing into his hands and blasting fat notes on his horn , trying to warm it . I pointed mutely to the depressed keys ( Look , man , no hands ) . Tommy lowered his 66 horn , chewed on a corner of his lip , and went off to find the hostess . Less than a minute later a skinny , alert-looking kid of about twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mansion 's rear portal onto the illuminated emerald lawn . " I 'm William . Mom says you have a prob-lem . " " Watch . " I struck a full chord : ten more hammers shot back and stuck fast like flies on molasses . " Huh . " The kid stuck his head inside and poked around . " What are these metal things ? " " No idea . " " But you 're the piano player . " " Right . Aot a mechanic . " It was almost farcical ; in what other profession are you so regularly sabotaged by the tools of your trade ? Four hours of egg-foo-yung tunes on this abomination and I 'd be a shattered man , licking my lips and blinking vacantly into the night shadows . " I wonder if its being out overnight had something to do with it . " " The piano was outside all night ? " l looked down at the grass ; already the evening dew was dampening my shoes . " The guys who set up the tables and decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas over it . " " That would n't have helped . The damp came from underneath and swelled the wood . It 's hopeless . " William 's face suddenly brightened . " Tell you what . I 'll stand here and free ' em for you . " By way of illustration he grabbed two handfuls of hammers and pulled them away from the strings . " See , now you 're back in starting position . " " You 're going to do that after every chord ? " " Well , let you play for a few bars and accumulate a backlog . " We were looking brightly , kind of crazily , at each other . I was beginning to learn about the kids of the affluent : they were different , possessed of a special awareness and guile that had nothing to do with the streets . I 'd already met ten-year-olds who were masterful con artists . " Tell you what you can do for me first . Bring me a stiff Southern Comfort on the rocks . " " We do n't stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double Beefeater over comin ' up . " We got under way , a motley crew of frigid coolies contriving chap-suet ' medleys -- - " China Boy , " " Chinatown , My Chinatown , " " Slow Boat to China , " " Japanese Sandman " ( nobody would know ) out of range of the overhead heaters , shoes soaking in the damp grass . I 'd play a bar or two , then lay out while William grabbed fistfuls of hammers and pulled them back in my face , announcing cheerfully each time , and driving me mad , " There you go , Mr. A. , back to starting position . " Two or three times an hour he took off to fetch me a fresh gin from the bar . Tommy observed this traffic with growing unease , doubtless pondering his obligatory report to Rudy tomorrow , with someone else in the band finking if , out of friendship , he glossed over any indecorous exhibition on my part . But I 'd worked under Tommy a dozen times and he knew by now that if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , unostentatious , professional Sob . " Now you know how Lewis and Clark must 've felt , " William said , depositing another gin and grasping a clutch of hammers . With the cold stiffening the horn players ' fingers and a piano chord infrequently punched in to no more advantage than a flung cowpie , every tune was starting to sound like " Donkey Serenade . " THE SHIVERING guests were beginning to desert the flagstone dance area , drifting back into the house , when Rudy put in his promised appearance . He sawed off a few bars on fiddle , wandered over to the piano , appraised the hammer situation ( taking cursory note of the backed-up gin glasses ) , muttered , " Jesus Christ on a crutch , " and left . On my sixth gin , watching Tommy tuck his hands under his belt beneath the little-girl dress for warmth , I thought , Another year of Rudy , coolie hats , and assorted monkey suits , of moisture-sodden , rotten-tomato pianos , and I 'd be reduced to a shadow of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Might as well sew up ducks ' rectums in a meat market , or trade off with that waiter carrying a tray of fresh foo yung to the warming table ; at least he was n't whoring , merely putting in his hours .

" There you go , back to starting position . " And just after midnight , as William heed the hammers for perhaps the two hundredth time , I gave it up : sat with my hands in my lap , stuporous , gazing at the slender , shadowy pinnacles of trees tossing in a high cold wind as the band ... played ... on ... " What 's the matter , Mr. A. ? " " Out of gas , William . Beat . Cold and tired . Do n't care anymore . " " That 's okay , we all grow old sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock pealing faintly behind the diamond-paned windows ) Tommy and company wrapped it up for the two diehard couples left on the flagstones with a final chorus of " Slow Boat to China " the fifth time around for that serviceable ditty  --  and we shucked our coolie apparel and packed up . William helped the drummer with his cases and waved us off . standing amid the littered , sauce-stained tables under the Japanese lanterns : " So long , you guys , see you all later at that big tuning fork in the sky ... " It would be sooner than William realized . The big fork sounded its knell for me before another month had elapsed . Rudy 's secretary phoned in mid-October to give me my week 's engagements . The last date was for Saturday night : Clearview Golf and Country Club , tux , eight to twelve . " And wear bathing trunks under the tux , " she added . I was sure I had heard incorrectly and asked for confirmation . She confirmed . I said , " Where are we playing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club supplying aqualungs ? " She testily repeated the information and hung up . I spent an uneasy week speculating on those bathing trunks . The fateful night arrived . " Gladiators and Charioteers " was the theme of the party , sponsored by the Junior League . Plaster statuary and colonnades amid the ferns ; purple grapes cascading from six-foot papier-mache urns ; helmets and wreaths garlanding the heads of the tuxedoed and gowned revelers . At the first intermission Tommy Tedesco told us to bring our instruments ? " Not you , " he smiled wanly at me ; " Drummer , take two sticks , woodblock , and cowbell " ? and we followed him to the downstairs locker room . Averting his gaze from us , frowning in concentration , Tommy undid the twine on the large clothing-store boxes , and the enigma was resolved : crepe togas . There was a moment of funereal silence . " Over the tuxes ? " a tremulous voice piped . " Under . The tuxes come off , " Tommy said , removing his coat and his suspenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go , " Tommy scowled , unclipping his tie and unzipping his pants . " What happens if we do n't ? " the second trumpet said . appropriating my question . In his canary-yellow bathing trunks Tommy looked at him incredulously . " Wha ' d' you mean ? You have to . " These were family men , with kids in nursery schools and colleges .
