" N'Djamena is finished " <P> For Chad , the scene was all too familiar . Cannon and machine-gun fire echoed through the streets of N'Djamena , the dusty riverside capital of the north-central African nation . Days of violent combat turned the city , which once had a population of 193,000 , into a smoke-shrouded battlefield . By week 's end , in spite of two abortive ceasefires , hundreds were dead , many of them civilians caught in the crossfire . Some 600 foreigners , including U.S. Ambassador Donald Norland , and up to 30,000 of Chad 's 4.5 million people had fled the war-torn country . In the capital , entire city blocks lay in ruins . Said one shaken Frenchman on arriving in neighboring Cameroon : " N'Djamena is finished . " <P> So ended an uneasy truce between warring guerrilla armies . The principal antagonists are two rival leaders who are members of Chad 's own central government : President Goukouni Oueddei and Defense Minister Hissene Habr .

Muslim Leaders Oueddei and Habr have since shared power in an eleven-faction alliance marked by mutual suspicion and hostility . <P> Chad 's warring leaders not only are locked in a power struggle , but also are seen as proxies of two foreign nations with rival interests throughout Africa : the sophisticated , Paris-educated Habr is associated with the French , while the ascetic revolutionary Oueddei is presumed to be close to the Libyans . <P> Last August all eleven factions met in the Nigerian capital of Lagos to attempt to reach agreement , and they established a fragile government of national unity . But the new coalition government has barely functioned since its inauguration . Last week the Lagos truce appeared to have been irrevocably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one cause for Western concern . Not only is Chad a mineral-rich source of potential instability in the very heart of Africa , but the backer of one key rebel faction , Libya 's Gaddafi , is a onetime protg of the Soviet Union and a troublemaking champion of Islamic radicalism throughout the region .
