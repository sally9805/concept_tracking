txt DO N'T WANT to die , " our daughter , Jane , said when she learned at the age ' of 25 that she had terminal cancer . But in the months that followed she proved that dying need be , her death was a kind of victory ? a battle won against pain and terror . It was a shared , triumph for Jane and for those who worked to help her , and especially for a new approach to the care of the dying . Afraid of pain , as all of us are , Jane had a horror of the nothingness that she believed death to be , a conviction that neither science nor religion could do anything for her . But Jane 's arrival at the . hospice was a turning point ; it enabled her to carry out the most difficult ' act of her life with ease and tranquility . What might have been an appalling and shattering experience was made as easy as possible both for her and for Us . She met her end surrounded by love , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . For us the memory is not one of pain and anguish but of her . calm smile and peace of mind . She was ready for what she . knew must come , accepting it with a serenity that belied her early fears . ? IT BEGAN ONE July morning in 1975 when Jane discovered that a mole on her foot had turned into an ugly , puffy , black-purple lump about the size of a ' small coin . At the hospital Jane learned that the growth was malignant , cancer . But the news was not all grim ; it was skin cancer and might not recur . After the operation her chances were no worse than those of anyone else ? no worse than the likelihood of her getting it in the first place . But the following February . Jane awoke , one morning to find a lump-in her:groin . It was ' a lymphatic tumor . At the diagnosis Jime swore , then burst into tears . Rosemary and the doctor watched help.lessly . Ten days later , after the operation , the surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fears had been confirmed . Jane , wrote : " I 'm not really sure what my reaction is . On the surface . I 'm very calm , very philosophical . I 'm also aware that many people with cancer are cured completely . Also that very many do die . " , Jane had melanoma , and the cancer was spreading . JANE CAME HOME from the hospital after the operation , and her brother Richard and Jane was a young Englishwoman , and she was dying Of cancer . When medicine hac done all it could ? and failed ? her parents decided to make her last days as serene as ' . possible . They turned to a hospice , a place where doctors and nurses , acknowledging the Imminence of death , are concerned with easing physical pain and giving both patient and family emotional support . This week in Tempo , Jane 's parents tel their story of how death is accepted natu ? rally and fearlessly in an Englidh hospice The three-part excerpt from their book , " P Way to Die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospice move . ment often is a concept rather than a place On .

Rosemary was afraid they might just burst in , tired and strained , and tell Jane the truth about her condition . Jane did want to know everything that Joan , who had been a paramedic , could tellher about melanoma . She apparently sensed that she was being kept  --  outside the knowledge the rest of the family shared . But she could communicate easily with Joan , and it was to her that she first put the question , " Am I dying ? " Joan could only answer that it was impossible to know . She thought Jane should share In the whole truth but obeyed Rosemary 's wish to keep the truth from Jade. , ? Two days after , their arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a blinding headache , in a deep depression . She lay all day ' in a darkened room , unable to bear even a crack of light . The bedroom quickly filled with flowers and birthday presents as friends arrived , but Jane could neither talk to them , nor , look at their gifts . Jane had to go back into the hospital for a third operation , followed by chemotherapy . Preparing for the third operation , we rented a flat near the hospital . We were anxious that Jane 's morale Should be as high as possible // Jane 's nightmare journey ends in peace at hospice Continued trent first Tempo mei and het stay in the hospital rio worse than it had to be . AFTER THE OPERATION Jane was moved into the farthest corner of the ward , where the nurses ? seldom passed . They would come to administer the painkillers , ' but only after all the other patients had been taken care of , even if Jane had been ready and crying for a pill long before . They had strict orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours , so , to be on the safe side , they madelt every three . Those who had once joked with her no longer stopped by her bed . They were too busy with other patients for whom they could still do something When Jane did manage to talk to a doctor , she would question him about her chances , but rarely did she receive any answers . Although no one said anything , Jane was getting the message . The signs meant she was reaching the end of the road " What 's the point of my staying here , " she asked , " if they ca n't do anything for me ? " Then the blow fell Victor phoned Rosemary from the hospital " They 've got the latest test result , " he said His ' ? voice was , heavy , flat " It 's in the bone marrow " This seemed to be the death sentence Finally and absolutely . We felt there was no hope , no sense even in continuing treatments , that there was nothing to be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N'T TELL a 25-year-old she 's going to die , " one of the doctors admonished Victor " It would make her life miserable to the end , and you do n't know how long that will be . " " Believe me , " another said , " I 've had a lot of these youngsters through my hands . I know how they react . " But might n't Jane be different ? Did we want to take the risk ? Once she knew , there would be no way to undo the telling . The unhappiness , the non ? communication , the rejection ? all could get much worse . Would we really be able to cope ? Did we even want to try ? The solution was offered : Take her away on a holiday and see how things went . " Give her a good time . " They could speed up radiation to ease the pain before she left the hospital . Then , if there were a crisis , they would send an ambulance and bring her back . She would have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " She wo n't know ' anything . " Not only were the experts prepared to assume the . moral responsibility for not telling Jane , they were urging her parents to avoid making the decision , too . We sat on the terrace discussing , first , the phys. ical arrangements for Jane 's return home to and , then , the family obsession ? what Jane should be told . JANE 'S BROTHER Richard believed strongly that Jane 's condition would soon deteriorate so much his mother would n't be able to look after ' her . Rosemary . felt equally strongly that home was the only place for her daughter . She wanted no more hospitals , no more strangers in charge . She could remember Jane 's weak whisper on one of the bad days : " Mum , do n't let me die here ; do n't let me die in the hospital . " " Can you imagine what it could mean to have Jane ' here ? " Richard asked . " Mum , please , " he implored Rosemary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must know that . She 'll need expert care ' round the clock . You 'll be exhausted , drained , just when you need all your strength . " Rosemary 's face showed no emotion ; it was as if she had hardly heard him . Dairy Cottage , she ' insisted , had always been a good place to live . It would also be a good place to die . Victor went to the hospital the day Jane was to check out . The rest of the family was sitting on the ' terrace when we heard a noise from Victor 's room . He had gone upstairs to change without even telling us he was home . When he joined us he was obvious . ly making an effort to appear normal . " You 're back early , " Rosemary said carefully . " Is anything wrong ? " " No , nothing 's wrong . " He sounded angry . " I do n't believe you . " " All right , then , " he burst out suddenly . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , the little bitch . Everyone in the ward could hear ! " They absorbed this in silence . Then Richard asked , " Do you think she 'll come home tonight ? " " Frankly , just at this moment I do n't particularly care . " FRIENDS HAD OFFERED to drive her home in the evening while we were busy with last-minute , preparations for her return , but by 9 o'clock there ' was still no Jane and no news . It was getting dark when at last we heard the sound of a car in the drive . We rushed to the door to see Jane coming slowly down the garden path ahead of her friends . She was wearing her bright Indian waistcoat and smiling cheerfully . Although she obvidusly was tired , she did n't look desperately ill . She kissed us all , including Victor , as if nothing had happened . Her outburst at the hospital seemed trivial . All that mattered was that Jane had come home . The next day , just before noon , the person we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talked to Jane alone . We sat in silence much of the time , wondering what was being said . At last the doctor came out alone to join us . He said quietly , " She was ready , so I told her . She accepted it easily . " AS THE PAIN Increased , the possibility of Jane 's getting up became more remote . Soon she could n't visit the bathroom without help . The next day , when she asked Rosemary to help her , she could barely put one foot in front of the other . She had to force her legs to make the steps . Her feet splayed out under the weight of a body unable to obey the mind 's signals . To sit on the toilet seat was an additional misery . She crouched on the lavatory with Rosemary struggling to hold . her upright and cried , " What am I doing to you ? " WHAT DOES a father think when his 25-year-old daughter is being carried off to a home for the dying ? . This father thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home again ? and that she would be much better off at the hospice than at home . What does a mother think ? This mother thought that the most terrible moment of all had come , and she was overcome by a sense of failure ? conviction that she had failed to preserve the child she had given life to and nurtured for so , many years . Finally , we were outside a small , low building , modern in design but unpretentious . It was only a few steps to the front door . Quickly , without a wasted movement , the two attendants wheeled Jane 's stretcher bed from the ambulance into the hospice . The nightmare journey was over . ? ?
