In New York , a mystery cast by Jennifer Bartlett <P> Twentieth century art has always liked the random . Chance meetings of images , the weird threat an unfocused eye hooks from the normal texture of life : these have fueled the reverie and invention of innumerable artists . From De Chirico 's piazzas to Steven Spielberg 's suburbs , our culture is intermittently fascinated by the noonday goblin-the sense that something is askew within the well lit , the ordinary , and that the closer you peer the odder it gets . Jennifer Bartlett , whose recent paintings are currently on view at the Paula Cooper Gallery in Manhattan , is a connoisseur of this kind of unease . There are exhibitions that mark a full assumption of powers : the idiom is assembled , the grammar wrought , the experiences wholly understood . So it is with this show of Bartlett 's , whose unlikely motif is a dull little French garden , and whose prevailing mood is an exacerbated sense of attentiveness , suspense and imbalance . <P> The paintings come , in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn artists since Van Gogh ; its blue , fouled coast is speckled with monumental names , Czanne , Renoir , Picasso , Matisse , Bonnard . Though condos , fast-food chains and jammed autoroutes from Bordighera to the Camargue have somewhat dimmed its luster , it still possesses-especially for those who have not been there-a durable allure . <P> Jennifer Bartlett , born in Long Beach , Calif. , in 1941 and a New Yorker for most of her working life , had never been there , and in 1979 she decided to get away from America for the winter by renting a villa in Nice . It turned out to be a dank monster , out of town but nowhere near the sea , with camphorated neighbors . The view consisted of a rectangular , tiled pool hedged with silvery artemisia bushes ; at one end stood a garden-gnome lump of a reproduction putto , coyly peeing into the water . Beyond that , some straggly shrubs , a screen of cypresses and a few glimpses of the house next door , as ugly as hers-and , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole Diver 's paradise . <P> Being stuck with the lease , Bartlett stayed there , and having nothing else to do she drew the view from her window , over and over again-a total of nearly 200 studies of the pool , the boy , the gravel , the cypresses , the shadows . She drew on the spot , from photographs and later from memory ; the banal content of the failed holiday slowly acquired a precision through being shuffled , isolated , winnowed . The final result is a group of eight large paintings in which the schematic dissection of the garden that Bartlett carried out in her drawings is rethought , the elements locked together in atmospheric and sinister grandeur .
