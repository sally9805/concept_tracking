A story by David Leavitt I " I " I RS . HARRINGTON was sitting in the oncology department waiting room and thinking about chicken when the realization came over her . It was like a fist knocking the wind out of her , making her need to gasp and whoop air . Suddenly the waiting room was sucking up and churning ; the nurses , the magazine racks , the other patients turning over and over again like laundry in a washer . Faces grew huge , then shrank back away from her until they were unrecognizable . Dimly she felt the magazine she had been reading slip out of her hand and onto the floor . . Then it was over . " Ma'am ? " the woman next to her was asking . " Ma'am , are you all right ? " she was asking , holding up the magazine Mrs. Harrington had dropped . It was Family Circle . " You dropped this , " the woman said . " Thank you , " said Mrs. Harrington . She took the David Leavitt will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked over to the fish tank and dropped herself onto a soft bench . The fish tank was built into a wall that separated two waiting rooms and could be looked into from either side . Pregnant guppies , their egg sacs visible through translucent skin , were swimming in circles against the silhouette of a face , vastly distorted , that peered in from the other waiting room . One angelfish remained still , near the bottom , near the plastic diver in the corner . Mrs. Harrington 's breath was fogging the fish tank . HE THOUGHT had come to her the way the carrier of a plague comes to an innocent town . She was read-ing a Shake ' n ' Bake ad , thinking about the chicken waiting to be cooked in the refrigerator at home , and whether she would broil it ; she was tense . She began to consider the date , December 17 : who was born on December 17 ? Did anything historic happen on December 17 ? Then , through some untraceable process , that date - December 17-infected her with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day she was supposed to be dead by .. RS . HARRINGTONne heard the head nurse call . " Yes , " she said . She got up and moved toward the long hallway along which the doctors kept their secret offices , their examination rooms . She moved with a . new fear of the instruments she could glimpse through slightly open doors . It was an intern who had told her , " Six months . " Then Dr. Sanchez had stood in front of her with his greater experience and said , " That 's youthful hubris , bravado . Of course , we ca n't date these things . We 're going to do everything we can for you , Anna . We 're going to do everything humanly possible . You can live a long time , a full life . " But she had marked the date on a mental calendar : six months . December 17 would be six months . And so it was . And here she was , still alive , having almost forgotten she was to die . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay down on the cold table . Everything is the same , she told herself . Broil the chicken . Chicken for dinner . The Lauranses ' party tonight . Everything is the same . Then the horror swept through her again . Six months ago she had been planning to be dead by this day . Her children on their way to a . new home . But it had been a long time . Things dragged on . Radiation therapy , soon chemotherapy , all legitimate means of postponement . She lost quite a bit of hair , but a helpful lady at the radiation therapy center directed her to a hairdresser who specialized in such cases as hers , could cut around the loss and make it imperceptible . Things dragged on . She made dinner for her children . She went to one meeting of a therapy group , and they told her to scream out her aggression and to beat a pillow with a hammer . She did n't go back . . " Hello , Anna , " Dr. Sanchez said , coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smelled of crushed cigars , leather . " How 're things ? " He obviously did n't remember . December 17 . " Fine , " she said . As if she did n't notice , he began to feel around her thighs for lumps . " The kids ? " he said . " Fine , " she said . " You 've been feeling all right , I hear , " he said . " Fine , " she said . " And you are n't finding the results of the radiation too trying ? " " No , not bad . " " Well , I 've got to be honest with you , when you start the chemotherapy in January , you 're not going to feel so hot . You 'll probably lose quite a bit of weight , and more hair . Feel like you have a bad flu for a while . " " I could stand to lose a few pounds , " Mrs. Harrington said . " Well , what 's this ? " said Dr. Sanchez , his hand closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and go , " said Mrs. Harrington , turning over . " That one on my back is pretty much gone now . " " Urn hum , " said Dr. Sanchez , pressing between her buttocks . " And have you had any pain from the one that was pressing on the kidney ? " " No . " " That 's good , very good . " He went on , thank God , in silence . Every now and then he gave grunts of approval , but Mrs. Harrington had long since realized that rather than indicating some improvement in her condition , these noises simply signified that the disease was following the course he had mapped out for it . She lay there . It no longer embarrassed her , because he knew every inch of her body . Though there were certain things she had to be sure of before she went . She always made sure she was clean everywhere . " Well , " Dr. Sanchez said , pulling off his plastic gloves and throwing them into a repository , " you seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did that mean ? That the disease was fine , or her ? " I guess I just keep on , do n't I ? " she said . " Seriously , Anna , I think it 's marvelous the way you 're handling this thing . I 've had patients who 've just given up to depression . A lot of them end up in hospitals . But you keep up an active life . Still on the PTA ? Still entering cooking contests ? I 'll never forget those terrific brownies you brought . The nurses were talking about them for a week . " ' Thank you , Doctor , " she said . He did n't know . No more than the woman hitting the pillow with the hammer . All these months she had been so " active , " she suddenly knew for a lie . You had to lie to live through death , or else you die through what 's left of your life . As she got dressed she wondered if she 'd ever be able to sleep again , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she would go to sleep in fear of never waking up , and wake up unsure if she were really alive . Lying there , terrified , in her . flannel nightgown , the mouthpiece firmly in place ( to prevent teeth-grinding ) , her eyes searching the ceiling for familiar cracks , her hands pinching what flesh they could find , as if pain could prove life . It had taken her many months to learn to fall asleep easily again . HE WAS one with the people in the lobby now . She had been aloof from them before . One she knew , Libby , a phone operator . She waved from across the waiting room . Then there was the man with the bandage around his head . A younger woman , probably a daughter , always had to bring him . She noticed an older man with a goiter on his neck , or something that looked like a goiter , in the corner , looking at a fish . " Good night , " she said to the nurses , tying her scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls ; a tiny tree gleamed dully in a corner . Outside the waiting room , the hospital corridors extended dim and yellow an the way to the revolving door . Mrs. Harrington pushed at the glass , and the first gusts of wind rose up , seeping in from outside . She pushed the glass away , emerging , thankfully , outside , and the cold , heavy wind seemed to bruise her alive again , brushing away the coat of exhaustion that had gathered on her eyelids while she was inside . It was cold , very cold . Her small heels crushed frozen puddles underfoot , so that they fragmented into tiny crystal mirrors . Rain drizzled down . California winter . She smoothed her scarf under her chin and walked briskly toward her car , a tall , thick woman , a genteel yacht in a harbor . The car was cold . She turned on the heat and the radio . The familiar voice of the local newscaster droned into the upholstered interior , permeated it like the thick , unnatural heat Rain clicked against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merging into regular traffic . She saw the stores lit up , late-afternoon shoppers rushing home to dinner . She wanted to be one of them , to push a cart down the aisles of a supermarket again . She pulled into the Lucky parking lot . In the supermarket the air was cool and fresh , smelled of peat and wet sad and lettuce . Small , high voices chirped through the public address system : Its a world of laughter , a world of tears , Its a world of hopes , and a world of fears .. ? Mrs. Harrington was amazed by the variety of brightly colored foods and packages , as if she had never noticed them before . She felt among the apples until she found one hard enough to indicate freshness ; she examined lettuce heads . She bought Spaghetti-Os for her youngest son , gravy mix , Sugar Pops . A young family pushed a cart past her , exuberant , the baby propped happily in the little seat at the top of the shopping cart , his bottom on red plastic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forgetting . An old woman stood ahead of her in the nineitems-or-less line . She was wearing a man 's torn peacoat . She bought a bag of hard candy with seventy-eight cents in pennies , then moved out the electric doors . " We get some weird ones , " the checkoutboy told Mrs. Harrington . He had red hair and bad acne and reminded her of her oldest son . ACK in the car , she told herself , " Try to forget . Things are n't any different than they were yesterday . You were happy yesterday . You were n't thinking about it yesterday . You 're not any different " But she was . The difference was growing inside her , through the lymph nodes , exploring her body . It was an inside . At the group therapy session a woman had said , " I think of the cancer as being too alive . The body just keeps multiplying until it ca n't control itself . So instead of some dark interior alien growth that 's killing me , it 's that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . Is n't that better ? " the woman had said , and everyone had nodded . Or is it , Mrs. Harrington was thinking , the body killing itself , from within ? , She was at a red light . " If the light changes by the time I count to five , " she said , " I will become normal again . One . Two . Three . Four . Five . " It changed . And maybe ifl ! had asked for six , Mrs. Harrington was thinking , that would have meant another ten years . Ten years ! S SOON AS Mrs. Harrington got I home , she hurried into the kitchen . Her son Roy was watching " Speed iRacer " on television . He was four- ? ! teen . She heard loud music in the ci : background : Jennifer ; Blondie : " Dreaming , dreaming is free . " And then the sounds of her youngest child , Ernest , imitating an airplane . She was grateful for the noise , for the chance to quiet them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roy asked . " Nothing , " Mrs. Harrington answered , " unless Jennifer cleans up like she promised . Jennifer ! " " Ma , " Ernest said , flying into the kitchen , " the party 's tonight , right ? Timmy 's gon na be there , right ? " " Right , " she said . He was her youngest child . His nose was plugged with cotton because it had been bleeding . Her daughter came in , had on a pink blouse Mrs. care for : " How was it ? " , scrub the pots . " Fine , " said Mrs. Harrington . " What 's for dinner ? " Roy asked again . " Chicken . Broiled chicken . " " Again ? " " Yes , " Mrs. Harrington said , remembering the days before when chicken had n't mattered . Those days took on a new luxury , a warmth to match Christmas , in this light-the four of them , eating , innocent . " Can I make some noodles ? " Roy asked . " Noodles ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Jennifer said . Roy stuck out his chest in a mimicking gesture . " I 'll make them , I 'll make them . In a few minutes , " he said . The boys left the room . " Dad called , " Jennifer said . " Was he at home ? " " He and Sandy are in Missoula , Montana . " " Ha , " said Mrs. Harrington . " One minute in Trinidad , the next in Missoula , Montana . " " He asked how you were . " " And what did you tell him ? " " The truth , " said Jennifer . " And what might that be ? " asked Mrs. Harrington . " Fine . " " Oh . " Mrs. Harrington melted butter in a saucepan , for basting . " Are you looking forward to the party tonight ? " Mrs. Harrington asked . " Yes , " Jennifer said . " As long as there are ' some kids my age . " CCASJONAL moments it came back to her , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when she was sitting on the toilet , in her green bathrobe , among the plants , her pantyhose and underpants around her knees . Suddenly , the horror swept through her again , because in the last six months the simple act of defecation had been so severely obstructed by the disease-something pushing against the intestine . She held the edges of the toilet with her hands . Pushed . She tried to imagine she was caught in ice , frozen , surrounded by glacial cold , and inside , only numb . But then , looking at the bathroom cabinet-the rows of pills , the box with the enema , the mouthpiece to keep her from grinding her teeth ( fit into her mouth like a handkerchief stuffed in there by a rapist ) - it came back to her , all of it . OY TOSSED the noodles with butter and cheese ; Jennifer sliced the chicken . A smell of things roasting , rich with herbs , warmed the kitchen . " Niffer , is there more cheese ? " " Check the pantry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernest said . Their mother came in . " Looks like you 've got everything under control , " she said . " I put paprika on the chicken , " Jennifer said . " I helped with dessert , " Ernest said . " It 's true , he helped me operate the blender . " Mrs. Harrington set the table , laid out familiar pieces of stainless steel . One plate was chipped . " Rat tart ! " Roy was shrieking in a high imitation of a feminine voice . He was recounting something he had seen on television to his sister . She was laughing as she tossed salad . Ernest rolled on the floor , gasping , as if he was being tickled . Mrs. Harrington smiled . They sat down to dinner . Food made its way around the table-the bowl of noodles , the chicken , the salad . Everyone ate silently for a few minutes , in huge mouthfuls . " Eat more slowly , " Mrs. Harrington said . She wondered where they 'd be today if , indeed , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had planned for that possibility . Jennifer and Roy , she knew , were old enough to take care of themselves . But her heart went out to Ernest , who had stayed at her breast the longest , born late in life , born after the divorce had come through . Little Ernest-he had lots of colds , and few friends ; crybaby , tattletale , once , a teacher told her , even a thief . He sat there across from her , innocent ; a noodle hanging from his mouth . ' " I wonder if Greg Laurans will be at the party , " Jennifer said . " Why , do you like him ? " asked Roy , leering . " Screw you . He 's very involved . " Jennifer reached to put a chicken liver she had accidentally taken back on the platter . " He runs a singing group at the state hospital through Young Life . " " Watch out for him , ' Jennifer , " Mrs. Harrington said . " This is just another phase for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been born again ! " Ernest said loudly . He said everything loudly . " Talk softer . " " He 's reformed , " Jennifer said . " But anyway , he wo n't be there . His parents are n't speaking to him , Gail told me . " Mrs. Harrington did n't blame the Lauranses . They , were good Jews-gave a sizable chunk of their income to the UJA . Jennifer played loud music and got low grades ; Roy had bad acne , did n't wash enough , smoked a lot of marijuana ; but compared to Greg Laurans , they were solid , loving kids , who knew what they wanted and were n't blinded by the insanity of the world . Jennifer and Roy both knew about the illness-though of course she could n't tell them " six months , " and they never talked about time . She guessed , however , that they guessed what she guessed . Dr. Sanchez had told her , " If you 're alive in two years , it wo n't be a miracle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be unexpected . " Ernest , however , knew nothing . He was n't old enough . He would n't be able to understand . It would be hard enough for him , she had reasoned , after she was gone ; at least let him live while he could under the pleasant delusion that she would be there for him forever . But now , Mrs. Harrington stared across the table at her son , and the reasoning that had kept her going for six months seemed warped , perverse . The way it stood , she would die , for him , as a complete surprise . It might ruin him . He might turn into Greg Laurans . And already she saw signs that worried her . She knew she would have to tell him soon . In a way that his seven-year-old mind could understand , she would have to explain to him the facts of death . For in light of new knowledge , she was questioning everything . In those dim months when the doc- : tors themselves , as well as Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to die , she had . become too complacent , she had not made enough plans for what would be left after her . Die . The word struck , and bounced off her skull . Soon , she knew , she would start to get thinner-when the chemotherapy began-and her hair would fall out in greater quantities . She envisioned herself , then , months , or perhaps only weeks from now , so different-bones jutting out of skin , hair in clumps like patches of weeds on a desert . She anticipated great weariness , for she would be lucid , fiercely lucid , and though she would look like death , she would live for the day when once again she would feel well . Her friends would come to see her , frightened , needing reassurance . " You look so tired , Anna , " they 'd say . Then she would have to explain , it 's the radiation , the drugs , it 's all to make me better . And when they marauded her , hegging that she complete that tantalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry or fear for themselves , she would have to temper their desire for anything in only the middle ranges of despair by pointing out that though she was getting better , she would probably be dead by next Christmas . Dead by Christmas ; she wondered if her children suspected that this would be her last Christmas . Then Jennifer would go to college , Roy and Ernest to her sister in Washington ( though her ex-husband would probably fight for a custody she had made sure he would never get ; she had at least covered that base ) . Now she looked at her children . They ate . they gossiped between bites . Dear God , she thought , how will they get along without me ? For if she had died today , they would probably be eating in a friend 's kitchen-the Lauranses ' or the Lewistons ' - in shock , as yet not really believing she was gone . There would be the unfamiliar smell of someone else 's cooking , someone else 's dinner , another way of making spaghetti sauce . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smell still in the closet , in the bed , lingering a few days , then disappearing from the world forever . Soon Ernest would start to cry forher , and alien arms would take him up . There would be nothing she could do - , She would be gone . They did n't notice anything different . Happily eating , arguing , in the cramped kitchen full of steam and the smell of butter . " Pass the noodles , " Mrs. Harrington said . " Mom , you never eat noodles . " HE DRESSED in a big , dark gown with an Indian design stitched into it-a birthday present from Jennifer . A life of objects spread out before her-the bed , the television , so many cans of Spaghetti-Os for Ernest . New products in the grocery store . The ads for reducer-suits in TV Guide . " Mom , let 's go , we 're gon na be late ! " Ernest shouted . " Ern , let 's watch ' The Flintstoncs , ' " Jennifer said . To help her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Harrington asked . " Yes , he is . " But when she emerged , perfumed , soft , Ernest did n't want to leave . " Dina 's run away , " he said . " We have to go , Ern , " Jennifer said . " Do n't you want to go to the Lauranses ' ? Do n't you want to see Timmy ? " Ernest started to cry . " I want to watch , " he said in a tiny voice . " All your friends will be at the party , " Mrs. Harrington consoled . " Oh shit , " said Roy , " why do you treat him like such a baby when he mopes like this ? You 're a baby , " he said to his brother . " I am not a baby , " Ernest said . " Babies cry ' cause they ca n't watch TV ' cause they 're going to a party instead . You 're a baby . " Ernest 's crying got suddenly louder . " You 've done it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely home , and the Harringtons were on their way . Dry-eyed . " Happy now ? " Mrs. Harrington asked . Jennifer and Ernest climbed into the back . " I hope Timmy 's there , " Ernest said . " Can I drive ? " . Roy asked . " Not tonight , I 'd be scared , " Mrs. Harrington said . " Then can we at least listen to KFRC ? " Roy asked . " Yeah ! Maybe they 'll have the Police ! " Ernest shouted gleefully . " Okay , sure , " said Mrs. Harrington . " You 're in a good mood , " said Roy , switching one of the preset buttons to the station he wanted . They pulled out of the driveway . The dark , warm car filed up with a loud , sad song : Why did you have to be a heartbreaker , When I was be-ing what you want me to be ... Roy beat his hand against the dashboard . He looked funny in his orange shirt and green tie-long hair spilling over corduroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and had adjusted the standard male uniform to his particular way of life . Oh , Mrs. Harrington relished that moment : her children all around her . What amazed her was that she had made them-they would n't be who they were , they would n't be at all , if it had n't been for her . Aside from a few sweaters and a large macrame wall hanging , they were her life 's artwork . She was proud of them , and fearful . They turned onto a dark road that twisted up into the hills . From the Lauranscs ' high window , Mrs. Harrington 's house was one of a thousand staggered lights spreading like a sequined dress to the spill of the bay . The Lauranses had introduced her to a woman who was involved with holistic healing . " Meditate on your cancer , " the woman had said . " Imagine it . Visualize it inside of you . Then , imagine it 's getting very cold . Imagine the tumors freezing , dying from freezing . Then , a wind chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Harrington said , overcome again . " Oh . " " Mom , what 's wrong ? " Roy asked her . In dark car , concern seemed to light up his face . could only look at him for a second because road was curving up to meet her stare . " Nothing , " she said . " I 'm sorry . Just a little pensive tonight , that 's all . " But in her mind she could see Dr. Sanchez 's hairy hands . HE PARTY was already in full swing when they arrived . All over the Lau- ranses ' carpeted living room the clink of drinks sounded , a slow , steady murmur of conversation . Ernest held Mrs. Harrington 's hand . She lost Jennifer and Roy instantly , lost them to the crowd , to their friends . Suddenly . They were on their own , moving in among the guests , who said hello , asked them what their plans were . They smiled . They were good kids , eager to find their friends . " Hey , Harrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roy was gone . Jennifer lost as well , to the collegiate generation-a boy just back from Princeton . Mrs. Harrington 's friends the Lewistons were the first to greet her . Mr. Lewiston had taught in the law school with Mrs. Harrington 's ex-husband , and they had remained friends . " How are you feeling , Anna ? " " How 're the kids ? " " You know , anything we can do to help . " She motioned toward Ernest with her eyes , do n't talk about it . Ernest , who had not been listening , asked , " Where 's Timmy ? " " Timmy and Kevin and Danielle are in the family room playing , " Mrs. Lewiston said . " Would you like to join them ? " " Kevin ! " Ernest turned to his mother , his eyes and mouth breaking . There was a red sore on his chin from drool . He started to cry . " Ernie , baby , what 's wrong ? " Mrs. Harrington said , picking him up , hugging him fiercely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbed . " He 's mean to me . " Kevin was the Lewistons ' son . As a baby , he had been on commercials . And the Lewistons looked at Mrs. Harrington in vague horror . " When was he mean to you ? " Mrs. Harrington asked . " The other day on the bus . He threw-um , he threw-he took my lunch and he threw it at me and it got broken . My thermos . " Mrs. Harrington looked at the Lewistons , for a brief moment accusingly , but she quickly changed her look to one of bewilderment " He did come home the other day with his thermos broken . Ernest , you told me you dropped it . " " Kevin told me not to tell . He-he said he 'd beat me up . " " Look , Anna , how can you-how can you think .. . ' Mrs. Lewiston could n't complete her sentence . " I 'll get Kevin , " she said . " Your son 's ac-cused him of something he 'd never do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you sure Ernest 's not making all this up ? " Mr. Lewiston asked . " Are you accusing him of lying ? " Mrs. Harrington said . " Look , we 're adults . Let 's keep cool . I 'm sure there 's an explanation to all of this . " Mr. Lewiston took out a handkerchief and swatted at his face . Ernest was still crying when Mrs. Lewiston came back , dragging Kevin by the arm . Ernest wailed . Mrs. Laurans , the hostess , came over to find out what was causing such a commotion . She ushered the families into the master bedroom to have it out " Kevin , " Mr. Lewiston said , seating his son on top of forty or fifty coats piled on the bed , " Ernest has accused you of doing something very bad-of taking his lunch and hitting him with it . Is this true ? Do n't lie to me . " " Bill , how can you talk to him that way ? " Mrs. Lewiston cried . " You 're never that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-dressed child , began to cry . The adults stood among their sobbing children . " Oh dear , " Mrs. Harrington said . Then she laughed just a little . Mrs. Lewiston took her lead , and laughed too . The tension broke . But Mr. Lewiston , overcome by guilt for treating his son badly , was holding Kevin , and begging his forgiveness . Mrs. Harrington knew what that was like . She also knew that Ernest had lied before . She led him over to the corner . " Did you make that story up , Ernest ? " she asked him . " No . " " Tell the truth . " " I did n't , " Ernest said . " Kevin says you did , " Mrs. Harrington said with infinite gentleness . " He 's lying . " " You ca n't pretend with me , young man . " Her voice grew stern . " Look , 1 want the truth . " Sternly , she lifted up his chin so that his eyes met hers ; she was on her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might once again break out in full-fledged sobs . But Ernest changed his mind . " All right , " he said . " He did n't throw it at me . But he took it . " " I gave it back ! " Kevin yelled . " I threw it to you , and you dropped it and the thermos broke ! " " Ah ! " all the parents said at once . " Two parties misinterpret the same incident . Happens all the time in the courts . I teach about it in my class , " Mr. Lewiston said . Everyone laughed . " Now , Mrs. Harrington , I think both these young men owe each other an apology , do n't you ? Kevin for taking Ernest 's lunch , and Ernest for saying he threw it at him . " " Boys , " Mrs. Harrington said , " will you shake hands and make up ? " The children eyed each other suspiciously . , " Come on , " Mr. Lewiston said to Kevin . " Be a good cowboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out a swaggering arm . Sheepishly , Ernest accepted it . They shook . " All right , all right , " Mrs. Lewiston said . " Now why do n't you two go play with Timmy and Danielle ? " " Okay , " Kevin said . The two ran off . " And we 'll all get a drink , " Mr. Lewiston said . HE ADULTS emerged from the bed-I room and made their way through the crowd . All of them were relieved not to have to face the possibility that one of their children had done something consciously malicious . But Mrs. Harrington had to admit that , of the two , Ernest had come off the more child-ish , the less spirited : Kevin Lewiston was energetic , attractive . He had spirit-took lunch boxes but gave them back , would go far in life . Ernest cried , all the time , made more enemies than friends , kept , grudges . Small children , dressed in their best , darted between and among adult legs . Mrs. Harrington , separated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a half-empty bowl of chopped liver . A trio of women whose names she did n't remember greeted her , but they did n't remember her name either , so it was all right . They were talking about their children . One turned out to be the mother of the boy from Princeton . " Charlie spent the past . summer working in a senator 's office , " she told the other women , who were impressed . " What 's your daughter doing next summer ? " the woman asked Mrs. Harrington . " Oh , probably doing what she did last summer , working at Kentucky Fried Chicken . " Or , perhaps , living in another town . The ladies made noises of approval . Then , looking over their heads to the crowd to see if her children were within earshot , Mrs , Harrington saw someone she had no desire to talk to . " Excuse me , " she hurriedly told the women . But it was too late . " Anna ! " Joan Lensky had seen her ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair tied tightly behind ' her head , dressed ( as always ) in black , was coming to greet her . " Anna , darling , " she said , grasping Mrs. Harrington 's hand between sharp fingers , " I 'm so glad to see you could come out . " " Yes , well , I 'm feeling quite well , Joan , " Mrs. Harrington said . " It 's been so long . Are you really well ? Let 's chat . There 's a room over there we can go to and talk privately . " Regretfully , Mrs. Harrington was pulled away from the crowd into an empty room . She did not enjoy talking to Joan Lensky ; the details of their histories , at least on the surface , bore too much resemblance to each other . Up until his death , Joan 's husband had been famous for making advances to his female graduate students-so often , and so clumsily , that his lechery had become a joke at the faculty wives , ' teas . Mrs. Harrington 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a law student , quit his job , and moved with her to Italy . After that Mrs. Harrington stopped going to the faculty wives ' teas , though most of the wives remained steadfastly loyal - none more so than Joan , who seized on the wronged Mrs. Harrington as a confidante . It made Mrs. Harrington nervous to realize how much she knew about Joan 's life that Joan herself did n't know - Joan , with her black poodles , her immaculate kitchen . Nevertheless , she put up with this demand-ing friendship for many years , chiefly because she felt sorry for the old woman , who seemed to need so badly to feel sorry for her . When she got sick she , changed her priorities . Now she only saw Joan when she had to . ELL w , then , how are you ? " Mrs. Lensky asked her gravely . They were sitting on an Ultrasuede sofa in a small sitting room , close together . Mrs. Harrington could feel Mrs. Lensky 's breath blowing on her face . " I 'm all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , no , Anna , " Mrs. Lensky said , shaking her head emphatically . " How are you ? " She could n't put off the inevitable any longer . " All right . I 'm on the tail end of radiation therapy . It 's having a fifty percent effectiveness rate . " " Oh , you poor , poor dear , " Mrs. Lensky said . " Is there much pain ? " " No . " " And your hair ? Is that a wig ? " " No , I have it specially cut . " Mrs. Lensky looked toward the ceiling and closed her eyes rapturously . " You are so lucky , my dear Anna , you do n't know , " she said . " My sister has a friend who is going through terrible ordeals with the radiation . All her hair . She weighs seventy pounds . Terrible . Do n't let them increase your dose ! Or that awful chemotherapy ! " " All right , " Mrs. Harrington said . " You must avoid chemotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said it was the treatment that killed her , because it was worse than the disease . Another woman I know was so sick she had to stay in bed for three months . She 's still so pale . Also , during surgery make sure they do n't leave any of their sponges inside your stomach ... " Mrs. Harrington counted her breaths , thought , it 's all she has to Jive for , other people 's sorrows to compare with her own . " Have you heard from Roy ? Is he still married to that child ? " " Yes , " Mrs. Harrington said . " He is . She 's actually very nice . They 're quite happy . " Mrs. Lensky nodded . Then she moved even closer to Mrs. Harrington , to deliver some even greater confidence . " I heard ' of an organization I thought you would want to know about , " she said . " It arranges for ... things ... before you go , So that your children wo n't have to worry about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they take care of everything ... just everything . " She handed Mrs. Harrington a small slip of paper that she had produced from her purse . " That 's all you need to know , " she said . At that moment , thank heavens , the door opened . Jennifer had come to rescue her mother . To help her out . " Mom , I need to talk to you , " she said . " I 'm sorry , Joan , " Mrs. Harrington said , standing . " We 'll 11 I 0%0 HANK YOU for rescuing me , " Mrs. ? iarrington whispered to her daughter . " Mom , you 're not going to believe it , " Jennifer said . " Greg Lau-I rans is here . And he brought ... those people with him . " " You mean from Young Life ? " " Them ... and some others . " In the dining room , the mass of guests had separated into small clumps , all engaged in not looking at the sunken bowl of the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Harrington glanced down curiously . Seated around the fireplace , by the Christmas tree , were Greg and a group of cherubic young people , all clean-cut , wearing little gold glasses and down vests . One had a guitar , and they were singing : A nd she draws dragons And dreams become real And she draws dragons To show how she feels Mrs , Harrington looked behind her . Mrs. Laurans was dropping an olive into a martini ; this , she thought , is cruel and unusual punishment . Then she noticed the others . There were three of them . Two boys , dressed neatly in sweaters . One had dark blond hair and round eyes . Occasionally the girl next to him had to take his chin between her thumb and forefinger and wipe it with a Kleenex . The other boy was darker , squatter , and could not seem to keep his head up . Every few minutes , the girl with the Kleenex would lift up his chin and he would look around himself curiously , like a child held before an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed head , too large , the shape of an ostrich egg . and half of it forehead , so that the big eyes seemed to be set unnaturally low . Yet they were alert eyes , more focused than those of the boys . From the corner where they were gathered , the three sang along : An se dwaw daguhs And de becuh ree An se dwaw daguhs Ta so ha se fee " They 're from the state hospital , " Jennifer told her mother . " They 'll probably live there all their lives . It was really amazing that they let them go to come here . It 's incredibly nice , really , even though it 's pretty horrifying for us . " " And for Greg 's mother , " Mrs. Harrington said , distantly . She stared down at the circle of singers . Now some of them were shoving pieces of paper and crayons into the invalids ' hands . And she draws unicorns 1-And makes us all free ( An se dwaw oonicaws ) " Come on , " the pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draw an oonicaw . " And after this , how . would it be for them , to return to . the wards ? " This is the cruelest thing of all , " Mrs. Harrington said to her daughter . . She turned around again , but Mrs. Laurans had disappeared . Quickly she walked toward the bedroom . She rapped oil the door , opened it . Ursula Laurans lay on . her bed , on top of fifty or sixty coats , crying .. Mrs. Harrington sat down next to her , rubbed her back . " I 'm sorry , Ursie . I 'm sorry , " she said . " Why does he do this to me ? " Mrs. ' Laurans asked . " He was getting so much better , he went to synagogue . ForChrist 's sake , he was a physics major , a goddamn physics major . Then one day he comes home and he tells me he 's found Jesus . He tries to convert us , his parents . You do n't know how it upse ? Ted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even accept the theory of evolution . A physics major ! He thinks everything in the Bible is true ! And now this . " " I 'm sorry , Ursie , " Mrs. Harrington said . Ted Laurans entered the room . " Oh God , " he said to his wife . " Oh God . I 'll kill him . How can he do this ? " " Shut up , " Ursula said . " It 's futile . You gave him all this bullshit already , about questioning . He 's beyond reason . " Why Were they telling her this ? Mrs. Harrington tried to be comforting . " Oh , Ursie , " she said . Then , very suddenly , Ursula Laurans launched up and landed against Mrs. Harrington . She fell against her , dead weight , cold and heavy . Mrs. Harrington 's arms went around her instinctively . Ted Laurans was crying too ; Standing and crying , softly , his hand over his face , the way men usually do . . " Maybe this is his way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's very kind , bringing them here . No other person would have done it . " " It 's all aggression , " Ursula said . " We 've been seeing a family therapist . It 's all too clear . I was n't enough of a mother to him , so he took the first maternal substitute he came across . " Mrs. Harrington chose not to say anything more .. Soon Ted Laurans ran into the bathroom , leaving the two women alone ' with the coats . VENTUALL Y , Mrs. Harrington emerged : Many of the guests were leaving ; in the kitchen she bumped into the dwarf girl , who was washing a glass in the sink with remarkable expertise despite the fact that her chin barely reached the counter . " Excuse me , " she said quite clearly . " I get under people 's feet a lot . " They both laughed . The dwarf girl smiled pleasantly at her , and Mrs. Harrington was glad to see thit she had the capacity to smile . The dwarf girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fake pearls . She had large breasts , which surprised Mrs. Harrington ; she wore a gold necklace and a little ring on one of her fingers . Obviously she was n't as retarded as the two boys . Mrs. Harrington turned around to look for her children . Then Ernest ran into the kitchen . He was crying again . He held his arms out , and she lifted him up . " Oh , Ernie , you 'll get sick from so much crying , " she said . , " I want to go home , " Ernest said . " What 's wrong ? Did n't you have fun ? " " They ditched me . " . " Oh , Ernie . " Three little children , two boys and a girl , ran into the kitchen , laughing , stumbling . As if she were a red light , they screeched to a halt at Mrs. Harrington 's feet " Ernie , you do n't want to play anymore ? " Kevin Lewiston asked . All the children 's faces stared up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning in to his mother 's shoulder . " All right , that 's enough , " Mrs. Harrington said . " I think you kids better find your parents . " " Yes , ma'am , " they said in unison . Then all three ran out of the room . . Mrs. Harrington was left in the kitchen , ? holding her child like a bag of wet laundry . He would probably want to sleep in her bed tonight , as he did all those nights . he had to wear the eye patch , to deflect lazy left eye syndrome .. " We 'll go home , Ernie , " she said to him . Then she noticed the dwarf girl . She was still standing by the sink , staring up at her . " Roy 's in the bedroom with some boys and they 're smoking pot , " Ernie mumbled to Mrs. Harrington 's shoulder , which was now soaked through with tears and drool . " Do n't be a tattletale , " Mrs. Harrington whis-pered . She looked down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf girl held a glass of water in her tiny fat hand ; the owl eyes in the huge head seemed gentle , almost pretty ; in the bright light of the kitchen , she wore an expression that could have indicated extreme stupidity , or great knowledge . Unmoving , the dwarf girl stared at Mrs. Harrington , as if the big woman were a curiosity , or a comrade in sorrow . ?
