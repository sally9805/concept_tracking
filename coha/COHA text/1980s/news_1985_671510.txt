" It ' s a special effort , not coincidental - a special effort , " said Mr. Koch , who has often responded to criticism that he is " insensitive " to blacks by initiating meetings with black leaders that were billed as rapprochements. // " It ' s not for the campaign alone , although obviously that has to be a consideration , " he said during an interview in his office . " I ' m running for a third term . I hope I ' ll be elected . I want to be elected with broad support. " // To that end , his well-financed campaign is reaching out to specific ethnic groups , including Hispanic voters and , particularly , blacks. // Before this year , " I made no special effort for anybody , " Mr. Koch said. // Since the primary campaign began , he has had an unplanned conversation with the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Washington , after which Mr. Koch told reporters how impressed he was with the former Presidential contender , whom he harshly criticized last year. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods , campaign headquarters in black areas that never had them before and targeted telephone calls , television commercials and mailings that are costing a good part of the more than $5 million that Mr. Koch has raised. // The Mayor and his top aides suggest news stories about those black community and church leaders who are supporting Mr. Koch , provide lists of names when asked and have prepared a graph of intersecting zigzag lines showing an improvement in the Mayor ' s rating among blacks based on newspaper polls from 1978 through this month. // His black opponent , Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. , dismissed the Koch campaign for black votes as " a blatant political move. " // " It will not be accepted by those people he has spent 7 1/2 years damaging in his services and his statements , " Mr. Farrell said . <> <> ' Awful Lot of Wounds ' // The other main candidate for the Democratic mayoral nomination , City Council President Carol Bellamy , agreed . " He ' s inflicted an awful lot of wounds over the past eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ' t heal , " she said. // But David Garth , Mr. Koch ' s political consultant , said the strategy was working , as reflected by Koch campaign polls , which are not being made public. // " The basic concept was , if the black vote is going to be the most difficult for him , you make a conscious effort to go after it rather than go away from it , " Mr. Garth said . The approach was decided upon early in the year and is unrelated , he said , to Mr. Koch ' s key opponents - Mr. Farrell , the first black to run against the Mayor , and Miss Bellamy , who hoped to capture the black vote herself by forcing Mr. Farrell off the ballot . She has since dropped her effort. // About a quarter of the Mayor ' s extensive field operation is devoted to reaching blacks , according to his campaign manager , James Capalino . Mr. Garth estimated that approximately 40 percent of the Koch television commercials have had what he called a predominantly " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hispanic voters and 30 percent to whites . <> <> Shift in Politics Cited // " It used to to be a general fear that if you put blacks in commercials , it was going to cost you a certain amount of white support , " Mr. Garth noted . " I think those days have past . I think there ' s been general acceptance . The highest-rated TV show is Bill Cosby , O.K. ? " // The Mayor speaks not in nuts-and-bolts political terms , but of his desire to reverse what he says is only a perception that he is unpopular among blacks ; he points to newspaper polls showing that he is doing well among blacks now. // But he has not won black support in recent primary elections . He said that was " understandable , " that his support among blacks was not equal to that among whites . He blamed , as he has many times in the past , the black press and some black leaders . He also said he had been moved by some of his meetings with blacks over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitized , " he said . " Are you perfect ? I ' m not perfect . " <> <> A Tempering of Language // His campaign consultant said he was particularly delighted that Mr. Koch had tempered his language and was being " cool. " // The campaign season did not start that way . Last winter , when a coalition of black and Jewish leaders said they wanted to improve relations between the two groups , Mr. Koch said they were being used by a " cabal " intent on deposing him . A few days later he said there was " a large amount of anti-Semitism " among black leaders he knew. // In the last few months , Mr. Koch ' s language has been conciliatory . He denounced Miss Bellamy ' s challenge to Mr. Farrell ' s nominating petitions , siding so strongly with Mr. Farrell - whose presence on the ballot is expected to split the anti-Koch vote - that the Assemblyman said he did not want the Mayor ' s help. // When a new book about Mr. Koch revealed that when he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. Dellums of California , a " Zulu " and a " Watusi , " he called Mr. Dellums to explain that he had meant the labels as compliments . <> <> Critical of Apartheid // Always a critic of apartheid , the Mayor initially opposed a move by trustees of the city ' s largest pension fund to phase out investments in companies that do business with South Africa , saying all " pariah nations " should be so penalized . He has since supported divestment and has become one of the country ' s most outspoken critics of the South African regime , comparing it to Nazi Germany. // The most concrete sign of the Mayor ' s new conciliatory approach was his talk with Mr. Jackson . Mr. Koch strongly criticized him last year for refusing to repudiate a Jackson supporter , Louis Farrakhan , leader of a Black Muslim sect who made anti-Semitic remarks . The Mayor called on Democrats to reject " the racism of Farrakhan and Jesse Jackson " //
