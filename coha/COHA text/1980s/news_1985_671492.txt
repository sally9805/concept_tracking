The police cracked down swiftly on the practice after the reporters were approached by peasant mothers in Shenzhen ' s Dongmen market . An article in The South China Morning Post said a baby girl was offered by a woman for 1 , 200 Hong Kong dollars , equivalent to $154 , and that others in the market had told the reporters that baby boys were going for 2 , 000 Hong Kong dollars , or $257. // The arrangement offered by sellers involved leaving the babies here until they could be smuggled by fishermen into Hong Kong , the British colony adjacent to Shenzhen. // At best this suggested that the " baby sellers " might take the money and disappear , along with their offspring . But in the freewheeling climate that has taken hold here , nobody could be sure that the mothers were not actually ready to trade their infants for cash . <> <> Special Economic Zone // Nearly six years have passed since this slim corridor of marshy farmland and fishing villages was named as the first of four special economic zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment and expertise it was to lead the way for the rest of China toward achieving Mr. Deng ' s goal of catching up with the capitalist world by the year 2049 , the centenary of Communist rule here. // With an investment of $1. 6 billion , Shenzhen has been transformed . A new city has been built along Hong Kong ' s northern frontier , swelling the population in the 131-square-mile zone to nearly 400 , 000 from 25 , 000. // Towering apartment and office buildings have sprung up along riverbanks where fishermen used to dry their nets , whitewashed factory buildings stand in rows along new avenues and the rush hour brings impassable roads jammed with Japanese-made taxis and trucks. // To a traveler who knew Shenzhen 15 years ago , when it was a sleepy border post for people entering China by rail from Hong Kong , the change is astonishing . <> <> A Bustling , Teeming City // Back then , the character of the place was set by the chickens that scratched about in the customs hall . Now , it has much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere more so than at the rebuilt railway station , where 10 , 000 travelers arrive daily from across the border. // In some ways the surge is a testament to the leap China has made under Mr. Deng , who celebrated his 81st birthday this week . But as the baby-selling incident demonstrated , not all the new activity here under his open door policy is the kind the Chinese leader envisaged. // Lately , matters have gotten to the point where he has described the Shenzhen zone as " an experiment " that could fail . That was a sharp pullback from a visit here last year when he said the area proved the " correctness " of his policy. // In part , Shenzhen ' s problems are economic . The $1. 6 billion that the zone ' s authorities have spent on roads , docks , housing and other construction has attracted foreign investors at a sluggish rate , with a total of only $700 million from such sources so far . <> <> Little High-Tech Industry // Few of those investments have yielded the high-technology industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal strength . Instead , the main investors have been Chinese entrepreneurs from Hong Kong who have taken advantage of wage rates that are about half those in the colony to open plants in plastics , metal fabrication and clothing , as well as other low-skill enterprises that assemble television sets and household appliances. // In addition to bringing in new technology that could be transferred inland , the zone was supposed to become a major foreign currency earner . But in this , too , it has fallen short of expectations , with only 40 percent of its products being exported and the rest selling locally or inland. // Beyond all this , Shenzhen has had to fight off attacks on its moral character . Under Mao , China lived by a social code of extreme austerity that was re-inforced by isolation from the world. // Mr. Deng ' s task has been to re-open the nation to the West , but to acquire technology and capital without corrupting the superior morality that China regards as its special preserve . <> <> Venal Element Emerges // So far , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across China , the experience has been that the loosening of economic and political constraints has aroused a venal element that seemed to have lain dormant under Mao. // If this has been at its worst in Shenzhen it is because the zone ' s closeness to Hong Kong magnifies the factors that have led to a bourgeoning of corruption , pornography and other social ills elsewhere. // The child-sellers are one example . Another is the organized bands of begging children , some of them only three or four years old , who ply the crowds outside the railway station . Reports in Hong Kong have suggested that some of the children have been abducted there and brought to Shenzhen for the purpose . Police in the zone have reported nearly 500 arrests for begging this year , some of them adults who direct the children. // Local officials say more than half of those arrested came from inland provinces , not from Shenzhen itself . The aim is to show that the zone ' s problems come not from its own population but from outside the 53-mile " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separates it from the rest of China . The same argument is made for a wide variety of social ills that afflict the zone , including " the girls who sell their smiles , " a Chinese euphemism for prostitutes . <> <> Active Money-Changing // Probably the most active enterprise in Shenzhen is black-market money-changing , a practice that has bedeviled the Deng policies from the start and that has reached endemic proportions here . Official Chinese accounts have said dozens of state enterprises that set themselves up here under commercial guises have made most or all of their profits from selling their hard currency allowances. // Deputy Mayor Li Guangjun shakes his head when such problems are mentioned . He says the Government is making " strenuous efforts " turn things around , " both by heightening our vigilance and by educating people in our socialist spiritual ideals.
