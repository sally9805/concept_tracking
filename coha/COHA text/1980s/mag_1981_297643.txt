In style , appearance and background , the two chief negotiators in Geneva could hardly differ more . At 74 , Paul Nitze is one of this country 's oldest and most distinguished diplomats . At 45 , Yuli Kvitsinsky is young indeed by the gerontocratic standards of Soviet officialdom . Nitze is elegant and urbane , with a glint of mischievous humor in his eye . The slightly pudgy Kvitsinsky is dour , outspoken and openly ambitious . Nitze is an experienced policymaker who had a hand in drafting his negotiating strategy ; Kvitsinsky operates with narrow instructions from Moscow . <P> Massachusetts-born and Harvard-educated , Nitze belongs to the cadre of well-bred Easterners who have helped shape U.S. foreign policy for decades . Since 1941 , when he gave up investment banking to join the Government , he has worked for nearly every Administration . In a celebrated 1950 memorandum , he defined the Soviet military threat and urged vastly increased defense spending . It was a call he was to renew many times over the years . <P> Nitze quit as one of Richard Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that the Watergate crisis was making Nixon so desperate for a treaty that he was willing to sacrifice U.S. interests . Nitze 's fear that SALT II would leave the U.S. vulnerable to a surprise Soviet attack led him to become the Carter Administration 's most visible , tireless and technically well-informed opponent in the debate over Senate ratification of the treaty . Yet while Nitze 's reputation is hawkish , he has never called for a return to military superiority over the Soviet Union . " Perhaps brilliant is not the right word to describe his mind , " says a veteran diplomat who has known him for years . " But it is very precise and disciplined . " <P> That is one trait Nitze has in common with Kvitsinsky . The son of an emigrant Polish engineer , Kvitsinsky grew up in Siberia . Assigned to East Germany from 1959 to 1965 and to West Germany since 1978 , he is one of Moscow 's large corps of German experts . It may , indeed , be the reason Kvitsinsky was chosen for the Geneva assignment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , he will be well placed to promote the Soviet Union 's image as a peace-loving nation to West German missile opponents through the press and television . But Kvitsinsky is no Germanophile . Noted the liberal Sddeutsche Zeitung : " He knows the Germans particularly well , and likes them particularly little . " <P> In Bonn , Kvitsinsky came across as outspoken , unyielding and yet not dogmatic . " He always takes the Soviet line , but he does n't talk ideology , " one fellow diplomat observes . " After a while you even get to like him . " That will not make him easy to deal with . Warns a Soviet colleague : " If you compare his age with Nitze 's , you will see who has more time to sit and talk in Geneva . "
