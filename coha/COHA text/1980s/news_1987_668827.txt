As it snakes along the boundaries of Libertyville , the Des Plaines River is water under a troubled bridge . Where Old Rockland Road hits the river east of the village , a narrow , ancient steel-truss span leaps from bank to bank , connecting town with country but dividing the citizenry , who can not agree on what to do with it . The bridge is in bad shape , everyone agrees . An engineering firm conducted a safety study this spring and was so alarmed by the " imminent danger of collapse " that it didn ' t even wait to issue a written report to call for closing the bridge to vehicles . The village and Libertyville Township , which jointly control the bridge , more or less paper-clipped it together with temporary repairs at that time so people could continue to drive across . Meanwhile , the debate rages on , as it has for months , on whether to repair or replace the riparian relic . On one side is the " Save Our Bridge " committee and its sympathizers . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They like it that way . " Safety comes in a lot of sizes , " said Carl Shem , a neighbor to the bridge and unofficial head of the committee . " A new , wider bridge will mean more traffic and fastertraffic . This community doesn ' t need it and doesn ' t want it . " Residential neighborhoods and old homes flank Rockland Road , one of only three local arteries from Libertyville that cross the river to the Tri-State Tollway . Neighbors say the narrow bridge serves to reroute traffic to nearby Ill . Hwy. 176 , and its old-fashioned design adds to the semi-rustic character of the area . " It ' s a bridge over the river and through the woods , " said a newspaper ad placed by the preservation committee . " An authentic and charming piece of Americana . " A Libertyville Department of Public Works study shows that the bridge has been the site of 11 reported accidents since 1982 , including an alcohol- related crash this winter in which two teenagers were killed when their car went out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that bridges don ' t cause accidents , " people cause accidents . " Cathy Westhoff , a commuter who drives Rockland Road twice a day , called it " an ugly . . . terrible bridge . If another car is coming in the opposite direction , you have to hesitate . It ' s ludicrous to try to control traffic by keeping an unsafe bridge . " Proponents of a modern , wider bridge are not organized , but they include village President Paul Neal and township highway Commissioner Elmer Henderson . " The neighbors say it ' s an antique , but , hell , so am I , " scoffed Henderson , 67 , " and nobody wants to look at me . " " The main thing is the safety of all the people , " added Neal . " And after that is money . " The recent engineering report said that rehabilitating the old bridge would cost $286 , 000 , 18 percent more than the price of a new , wider and much stronger bridge . The legal liability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge has also become an issue , as has the charge that those who live near the bridge are selfishly attempting to maintain a peaceful little street at the expense of progress . But township Supervisor F.T. " Mike " Graham said he and his board believe that the wishes of those who must live with the bridge should prevail . " The current bridge has esthetic value , " he said . " A wider bridge would bring traffic , which would beget more traffic . As it is , the bridge helps to preserve a bit of rural Libertyville , which is what people move here to find . " Thus does the Rockland Road bridge , load limit 6 tons , find itself carrying the weight of tradition  --  shaken not only by thousands of cars daily but also by the forces of change . " We don ' t want another Schaumburg here , " said Graham , who has also been carrying the torch for a controversial open-space plan in the township . The battle in some ways replays a dispute of 1960 , when engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began wringing their hands trying to figure out whether repairing it would simply be throwing good money after bad . The span was closed until 1962 , when the village compromised and bought a used railroad bridge , vintage 1921 , from downstate Vandalia . It solved the problem for the time , but today the skies over the river are dark with chickens come home to roost . The fate of the bridge was a hot issue in the recent village elections , where two save-the-bridge candidates won seats , replacing two replace-the- bridge trustees who stepped down . But because the bridge straddles the town line , whatever the village board decides has to pass muster with the township , and vice versa . A joint township-village meeting early this month went nowhere , and the future appears to hold a protracted legal and legislative wrangle . Options still open include installing stop lights or stop signs along Rockland Road to slow down traffic if a new bridge goes up and making the existing bridge an alternating one-way span . Save Our Bridge committee leader Shem has an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " All of us who live here would be delighted to have the bridge closed to traffic for good . " Then they would indeed have their own private roads : Rockland Court One and Rockland Court Two , broad , mighty cul-de-sacs terminating abruptly on the gentle banks of the Des Plaines .
