The trouble started last month , when Milwaukee 's premature spring temperatures gave way to a brief snowfall . Jeff Barnett , 33 , and Roommate Bill Hackbarth , 30 , built a life-size snow sculpture of a family at the beach : kids playing , Dad holding a beer can , Mom in a light blue bikini spray-painted on her shapely form . Enter Kathleen Zanio , 43 , a former Franciscan nun , who drove by the sculpture one afternoon . " Here was this woman with large , protruding breasts and abdomen , " says Zanio frostily . " It was obnoxious and repulsive . " <P> Zanio , who works as a carpenter , took a hatchet from her car trunk and started to smash the snowwoman , but fled when Barnett rushed out of his house . " We had her arrested to let people know they ca n't go hacking things down , " says Barnett . Last week Zanio was charged with disorderly conduct ; she could face a $200 fine .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
