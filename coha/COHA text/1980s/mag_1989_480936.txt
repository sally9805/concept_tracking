Below is an excerpt from a 292-page transcript of the police interrogation of Tom F. Sawyer , a suspect in a murder that took place in Clearwater , Florida , in 1986 . Sawyer , a thirty-six-year-old groundskeeper at a local golf course , was brought in for questioning after his neighbor , twenty-five-year-old Janet L. Staschak , was found strangled in her bed , naked . After sixteen hours of questioning , Sawyer , who is a recovering alcoholic , confessed to the rape and murder of the woman . He spent fourteen months in jail before Judge Gerard J. O'Brien Jr . released him pending a pretrial hearing on the validity of the confession . In the summer of 1988 , O'Brien threw out the confession , ruling that the detectives ' interrogation methods ? which included sleep deprivation , leading questions , and inadequate Miranda warnings ? had deprived the suspect of his right against self-incrimination . The judge 's ruling left the state with no evidence against Sawyer ; blood and hair samples taken from Staschak 's body and bedclothes did not match his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rape he had confessed to . The prosecutors have appealed O'Brien 's ruling to the state supreme court . The interrogation , which began at 4 P.M on November 6 , 1986 , had been under way several hours when this excerpt begins . DETECTIVE JOHN DEAN : Let me ask you something . I think you 're a pretty sharp guy . I think you watch a lot of cop shows . You do n't read books , right ? Cop books ? You know , I read Agatha Christie for a while and some ? Do you read magazines ? TOM E SAWYER . I do n't really read anything . DEAN : Okay . Well , you seem pretty sharp , pretty observant . Okay , you got a young girl . She 's not bad looking . You know , I only know by pictures . Everybody likes her that she works with . SAWYER : Uh-huh . DEAN : She do n't have a boyfriend . She turns up dead in her apartment . SAWYER : Uh-huh . DEAN : What do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let me tell you something . We do 120 cases a month , each . Not homicides , obviously , or this would be Dodge City . But most of our cases , solving cases , we get help from the outside . Somebody calls up and says try this or do that , or a lot of times I use my girlfriend . Run this by her and she 'll say , Did n't you ever think of this ? Given that set of circumstances , what would you look for ? SAWYER : What did she die of ? You ca n't tell me that ? DETECTIVE PETER FIRE : You tell me what you think . You be a homicide investigator . DEAN : Some theory . FIRE : Give us your theory .... SAWYER : At first I figured it has to be someone that knows her . FIRE : Okay . Why do you say that It 's a good theory . Why do you say that ? SAWYER : ' Cause I did n't think that she 'd he the kind of girl just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dates stay over . FIRE : Good , you 're giving us input that we do n't have knowledge of and this is good . SAWYER : But see , I might have a whole wrong opinion of her . FIRE : Okay . Fine . This is good . DEAN : Better than what we got . We do n't even know the girl , right ? When you think about it , right ? SAWYER : But you got all these other people 's opinions too , so you should be able to know her by now . DEAN : But you know what ? Are n't you different at work than you are at home ? SAWYER : No. laughing DEAN : Same guy , huh ? SAWYER : Pretty much . Oh , I bullshit a lot more at work . FIRE : Everybody does . We 're talking to all those people , they 're all her friends . And they 're giving us a biased opinion really , favoring her . They 're not going to tell us if she did have any had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be biased , too , because of the fact that I was attracted to her . FIRE : All right . Fine . SAWYER : And so I do n't want you to think she was an angel because I was attracted to her . That 's a stupid , sick thought to me because people ai n't angels , but I mean FIRE : Well we all got our ups and downs and prohlemsDEAN : Who 's perfect ? FIRE : Who 's perfect ? That 's why we 're on earth . laughing All right , look . SAWYER : At first I thought it was probably somebody that knew her , just because I would n't imagine that she 'd bring somebody home that she did n't know . FIRE : Okay . Good . Thank you . That 's good . SAWYER : Okay . The other part I heard from Mary or them girls was that she had a date , or that they went out Friday night , and she wanted to go to another place and they did n't , so maybe she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll band . Hard-rock band . Maybe she met a guy there , right ? She gets a date with him , Saturday night .... FIRE : Okay . SAWYER : Okay . This is really stupid . FIRE : No it 's not . It 's interesting . DEAN : It 's never stupid . FIRE : It 's never stupid . We would n't be talking to you . SAWYER : Well , as many people come as go in Florida FIRE . It 's a transient state . We all know that . SAWYER : Yeah , this guy could have been from any state .... He might have went back to her place with her FIRE : Okay . SAWYER : He might have killed her and took her car to the airport and split . FIRE : That 's good . That 's good thinking . SAWYER : I think it 's stupid . laughing DEAN : Why ? SAWYER : ' Cause that 's something you 'd see in the goddamn movies , you know . FIRE : Why would you think it 's stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them ai n't bad because they got ex-cops as technical advisers . FIRE : They use some of them , they 're actual cases . DEAN : Right . You watch Quincy . That guy did n't talk mumbo jumbo . If you sat there with an encyclopedia of medical terms ? SAWYER : That 's right , yeah . FIRE . He was on the money . All right , so ? What do you think happened in the house ? Opinion again . Let us know . SAWYER : I think she would n't fuck him . laughing He killed her and left . laughing FIRE : Okay . How ? Why ? What is your opinion of what happened ? That 's good . Very good . Probably so . What do you think happened ? SAWYER : What do I think happened ? How he killed her ? FIRE : However . Whatever you think . 1 do n't ? You know . SAWYER : I do n't know how he 'd kill her . ' Cause you would n't have sex with a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well it 's not nutty . Maybe he 's upset . That 's all . SAWYER : Yeah , he 's probably pissed off . FIRE : That 's right . He does n't have to be nutty . She could set him off wrong , you know . Do n't have to be his fault . SAWYER : Yeah , right , yeah . FIRE : Right ? She could have caused the problem . DEAN : There have been several women in the past that have been known to piss off guys . SAWYER : Yeah , okay . He 's got the attitude I 'm gon na get this hitch , right ? FIRE : Because he 's been rejected . SAWYER : Right . FIRE : Okay . Then what ? SAWYER So then he rapes her , but he 's got to kill her now or he 's gon na get put in court for rape . FIRE : Right . SAWYER : But he likes her , so how could he kill her ? Oh well . FIRE : Well , it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAN : Maybe it happened while he was raping her . He was just trying to hold her still and ME : You 're saying he strangles her , right ? How does he strangle her ? From the front , behind , or what ? SAWYER : Front .... FIRE : So what would he use ? One hand or two hands ? What would be your theory ? SAWYER : Two . FIRE : Two hands ? Okay . What is she doing in the meantime ? SAWYER : Probably trying to claw his eyes out . laughing FIRE : All right . DEAN : Now what do you do with that ? FIRE : Yeah . How would he deal with that ? SAWYER : He 'd have to use one arm and try to hold her back or something . FIRE : Okay . DEAN : He 's holding her from hitting him with one hand ? And he 's choking her with the other ? Is that what you 're telling me ? SAWYER : Uh-huh . FIRE : And then what happened ? DEAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick him in the balls ? SAWYER : You got to knock her out ! FIRE : Okay . SAWYER : He 's got to knock her out somehow . FIRE : He 's got to knock her out because she 's resisting . SAWYER : Right . FIRE : I think so .

SAWYER : They 're in the living room . FIRE : Okay . They 're in the living room . And then what happens ! SAWYER . She 's dead . DEAN : Okay . FIRE : All right .
