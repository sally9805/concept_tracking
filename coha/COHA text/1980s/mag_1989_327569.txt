THE PAT SAJAK SHOW <P> CBS ; weeknights , 11:30 p.m. on most stations <P> Take on Johnny Carson ? Do n't make us laugh . Failed challengers to the Tonight show king have piled so high in recent years that noting them has become an exercise in sadism . The surprise last week was that Pat Sajak , whose late-night talk show on CBS debuted to friendly reviews and better-than- expected ratings , proved instantly that he is the man to beat as Johnny 's spiritual heir . <P> Actually , the Pat Sajak Show has stationed itself carefully between those twin towers of late night , Carson and David Letterman . Like Letterman , Sajak has a touch of self-mocking irony and presides over irreverent comedy bits , which range from funny ( Sajak goes to the doctor ) to lame ( audience members are enlisted to play Dunk an Auto Mechanic ) . But the show 's physical look ( band on the right , desk and couch on the left ) and format ( opening monologue followed by brief chat with easygoing sidekick ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are all unmistakably Carson . <P> Sajak , the longtime master of Wheel of Fortune , appears amazingly comfortable in his new role . In voice and manner he recalls both Jack Paar and Dick Cavett , and , like them , is striving for more substance in his interviews than the thoroughly programmed Carson . He threw Chevy Chase off balance with a question about his draft status during the Viet Nam War and asked Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth about beer drinking at the ballpark . When actor Charlie Sheen alluded to a past run-in with the law , Sajak politely refrained from pressing ahead but at least seemed aware of why . " I would n't want to * break a time-honored talk-show tradition and ask a follow-up question , " he cracked . What 's encouraging is that Sajak gives the impression that someday he might .
