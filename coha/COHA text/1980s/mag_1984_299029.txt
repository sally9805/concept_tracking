OPEN ADMISSIONS by Shirley Lauro <P> Calvin Jefferson is a black college student with a B average , reading skills arrested at the fifth-grade level and an anguished , angry awareness that the false hopes raised in him by the educational policy from which this play takes its title are lies . Ginny Carlsen is a white college teacher reduced to showing students how to project an educated image for personnel directors , but prevented from providing substantial learning to sustain their careers or their lives . Playwright Shirley Lauro also has a second meaning in mind for her title , as she crudely but forcefully maneuvers her principal characters toward open admissions of their mutual victimization . <P> That confrontation constituted the sum total of Lauro 's one-act play produced off Broadway in 1981 ; one can see why she was encouraged to develop it to full length for Broadway . Calvin and Ginny may be symbolic representations , but they are also potent characters in their own right . The student 's basic gentleness makes his rage , when it surfaces , all the more terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk cheer with which she tries to sell deceit to her self and her students the more poignant . <P> In these emotionally rich roles , Calvin Levels and Marilyn Rockafellow , under Elinor Renfield 's forcefully realistic , behaviorally sensitive direction , are at once strong and subtle . They are so good , in fact , that they point up the superficiality of the out-of-school lives the playwright has concocted for them . They seem to have been plucked out of sociology texts rather than absorbed from life , expanding the play 's length without usefully expanding our understanding of its people . Nonetheless , the heart of the play is sound , and its beat is worth listening to .
