 | What could be more unpopular in an age of sexual equality than to insist that the psychological differences between men and women are as fundamental as their physical ones ? Science writer Maggie Scarf , however , wonders what else could explain some lopsided statistics : for every man suffering from depression , there are two to six times as many women . Scarf studied case histories , observed women under treatment in psychiatric clinics and interviewed scores of others in her search for an answer . Now , in a powerful and disturbing book called " Unfinished Business : Pressure Points in the Lives of Women , " * she announces a conclusion that has aroused the ire of feminists ? but may evoke the shock of recognition from many other women . Scarf 's thesis is that women are vulnerable to depression because emotional attachments are much more important to them than to men . In many cases , she says , women define themselves almost exclusively by their relationships to others . When these bonds break ? through death , divorce or children leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather kill themselves than live alone . Scarf locates the female need to connect in the evolutionary past , aligning herself with theorists who believe that primitive behavior patterns have evolved through time just as our bodies and brain structures have . Citing the " attachment theory " of English psychoanalyst John Bowlby , she speculates that emotional bonding is a behavioral mechanism developed by infant primates to keep their mothers close by . In what may be her most controversial passage , she says that this trait evolved more strongly in females than in males ? and eventually found its way into the female genetic code . Recent studies of infant responsiveness tend to support her claim . They show that female babies react more readily to photographs of the human face than male babies do . The males could not discriminate between photos and line drawings , but the females preferred the photos . Mood : These apparent differences raise a troubling possibility : that emotional bonding , once a key to survival , is making women 's lives more difficult in today 's feminist era . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them toward marriage and family , and a society sending them powerful new signals to be independent . While Scarf admits that men also suffer from depression , she says that the condition is usually triggered by failure in their profession , not in their personal relationships . It might seem logical that women who follow men into the marketplace would be less vulnerable to depression . Not so , says Scarf . The working women she studied were just as depressed as those who stayed at home , reinforcing her unsettling conviction that mood is a function of biology . " I freaked out when I started interviewing people and it was coming out this way , " says Scarf . " I said I ca n't write this because people are going to see it as a sexist statement . " Some of her critics do see the book just that way . " It 's a seductive sellout of the feminist goals of greater autonomy for women , " charges New York feminist Barbara Seaman . Ruth Greenberg , a therapist at the University of Pennsylvania 's Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written " from a female chauvinist point of view . It makes depression look good , because it 's a result of women 's deep commitment to relationships , capacity for nurturing and greater sensitivity . " Greenberg also questions Scarf 's claim that most people who suffer from depression are women ; the figures , she says , do not include males afflicted  | by alcoholism and other depressive disorders . Dr. Aaron Beck , director of the Center , admires the book but shareGreenberg 's skepticism about Scarf 's statistics . " They 're biased , " he maintain , " Men just do n't seek help to the same degree that women do . " Scarf , a respected journalist , defends her book as " absolutely fine science , " and says she simply followed where her research led She began by attaching herself to a resident in psychiatry at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Mental Health Center , trailing him " everywhere but the men 's room . " During the next four years she interviewed over 150 women , including patients at the University of Pennsylvania 's Mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not have to seek out people , " she recalls . " They crawled out of the woodwork . " Scarf says the interest in her project made her think that the problem of women and depression " has been an underground issue for a long time . " And in every case , she says , the root of depression was " the disruption of crucial attachments . " Scarf herself formed a crucial attachment to the women whose histories she explored . " I 'd like to have written more about those people , but my editor told me there was a point where I had to stop , " she says . " I was like Penelope at her loom , wholly absorbed in the weaving of these lives . " Bonds : Scarf concluded that a woman 's depression is related to specific phases of her life . At key points , all women must make and break a series of emotional bonds . If they fail to do so , if they become emotionally stranded , their " unfinished business " almost inevitably leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about separating from their parents . Women in their 20s focused on balancing the desire for a family with the demands of a career . And at mid-life , women had to confront the loss of their roles as wives and mothers . Contrary to Scarf 's expectations , she discovered that menopause is more an emotional issue than a hormonal one . " I thought I would find menopausal depression keyed to hormone loss , " she admitted . " But that was the one thing I did n't find . " In fact , says Scarf , women in their early 30s suffer far more depression than those going through menopause . " Unfinished Business " encourages women of all ages to get professional help for depression ; in fact , Scarf 's acceptance of drug treatment prompted Seaman to denounce the book as " an apology for the conventional male psychiatric establishment . " But Scarf 's real message is more poignant . At a time when one marriage in three ends in divorce , when women outlive their husbands by nearly a decade and when geographic mobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live alone and like it . @#
