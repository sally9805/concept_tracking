Only a week before , Ronald Reagan had been all smiles as he ushered Douglas Ginsburg into the East Room of the White House to the applause and cheers of supporters . True , the former Harvard professor was , at 41 , unusually young to be nominated to the Supreme Court and , with only a year on the federal bench , somewhat inexperienced . But the candidate for Associate Justice was , the President declared , " a man who believes profoundly in the rule of law . " <P> Nine days later Ginsburg , under pressure from White House aides and his right-wing backers , withdrew his name . He did so gracefully , declaring in a 65-second appearance in the White House briefing room , " Unfortunately , all of the attention has been focused on our personal lives , and much of that on the events of many years ago . My views on the law and on what kind of Supreme Court Justice I would make have been drowned out in the clamor . " Then he wisely turned his back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight . <P> The clamor that Ginsburg cited had stemmed from his admission that he smoked marijuana as a college student in the 1960s and as a law professor reportedly as late as 1979 . Marijuana " was the only drug I ever used , " he said in response to inquiries . " I have not used it since . It was a mistake , and I regret it . " <P> Although Ginsburg 's indiscretion may have been common among members of the Big Chill generation , his confession fatally undermined his support among the Capitol Hill conservatives who had lobbied so hard for his nomination . The disclosure was the final straw in a week of controversy that included accusations of conflict of interest over his investment in a cable-television company , charges by a congressional committee that he ordered the destruction of documents while he worked at the Justice Department , allegations that he improperly sidetracked rules to limit the use of cancer-causing asbestos , and the revelation that his wife , an obstetrician , performed two abortions while in medical training . <P> A more substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations about his earlier life . But so little was known about Ginsburg that it was easy for minor matters to grow into major questions about his fitness to serve . His admission that he smoked pot should not have been an automatic disqualification . If it were , the ranks of Government might be devastated . The National Institute on Drug Abuse has reported that more than 23% of the adult population has used marijuana , including a staggering 64% of those ages 18 to 25 . Indeed , two Democratic presidential candidates , Albert Gore and Bruce Babbitt , were prompted to admit that they too had tried pot years ago . Similar confessions came from Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and conservative Republican Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia . <P> Nor could the most ardent foe of abortion have written Ginsburg off merely for marrying a doctor who performed the procedure a few times before deciding to stop . Similarly , Ginsburg 's investment in a cable-television company while he served in the Justice Department was not illegal . By themselves , these incidents could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of the solid , well-grounded individual the public would normally expect on the Supreme Court .
