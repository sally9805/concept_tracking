" Rashadat , Rashadat . This is the U.S. Navy . We will commence firing on your position at 1400 hours . You have 20 minutes to evacuate the platform . " The warning was broadcast from a convoy of four U.S. destroyers steaming 3 1/2 miles southeast of Iran 's Rashadat oil-loading platforms in the Persian Gulf . The Iranians did not reply , but within minutes 20 to 30 men were seen scrambling off the facility , situated 75 miles off the Iranian coast , and into a small boat that sped north toward Lavan Island . The warships  --  the U.S.S. Hoel , John Young , Leftwich and Kidd  --  then poured 1,065 rounds of 5-in. shells onto the two platforms . When the blasting was over , the structures had been reduced to twisted , flaming hulks . <P> With the naval bombardment , the conflict in the Persian Gulf entered a new and more dangerous phase , one characterized , in typical Middle East fashion , by attacks and counterattacks , retaliation and revenge . The U.S. was responding to Iranian Silkworm missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks ago . The Sungari is U.S.-owned , and the Sea Isle City is one of eleven Kuwaiti tankers now flying the American flag . President Reagan called the 85-minute blitz of the oil platforms a " prudent yet restrained response " to Iranian aggression . Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told a press briefing after the Navy action , " We consider the matter closed . " <P> The Iranians , however , did not see it that way . " God willing , we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry , " said Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani . At midweek the vow of vengeance was made good . Yet another Silkworm missile was launched from the Iranian-occupied Fao peninsula , about 50 miles north of Kuwait City . The missile scored a direct hit on Sea Island , Kuwait 's only deep-water oil-loading facility . The strike caused an explosion that could be heard 20 miles away in Kuwait City . The loading dock 's destruction could temporarily cripple the emirate 's ability to pump its oil aboard the largest supertankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so only five workers were hurt , none seriously . <P> Kuwaiti defense forces on Failaka Island , 15 miles northeast of Kuwait City , watched the Silkworm blast off from Fao and head toward the oil dock . No effort was made to shoot the missile down , as had been done with the Silkworm that hit the Sea Isle City . Late in the week , however , Kuwaiti officials announced that they were setting up U.S.-made Hawk missile batteries on Failaka , where they will be close enough to Fao to interdict the Silkworms . The Kuwaitis have had the Viet Nam-era missiles since 1975.
