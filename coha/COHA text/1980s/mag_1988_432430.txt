 | When the big stainless-steel vats and electronic equipment began showing up in hospital urology units a couple of years ago , kidney-stone victims and urologists cheered . It seemed as if major surgery , and its pain , risk and hospitalization , would never again be needed . But the enthusiasm that greeted shockwave lithotripsy , as the treatment is called , was a bit overdone . Kidney stones are rarely life threatening , but they inflict excruciating pain on more than 300,000 Americans each year . For unknown reasons , 4 of every 5 patients are men . A stone usually starts to form between ages 20 and 30 , and the stone finally announces its presence during middle age . Kidney stones develop when salt and minerals in the urine ? primarily calcium and oxalate ? clump together and grow , like a malevolent pearl inside an oyster , instead of being diluted and passed out of the body . Stones form for reasons ranging from diminished water intake and diets high in protein and calcium to genetic disorders , infections and the misuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain that soon sharpens and intensifies as the stone shifts or blocks the flow of urine . It typically begins in the side and radiates down the abdomen toward the groin . Blood often appears in the urine . If the stone is small enough usually less than 5 millimeters , or ' / ; inch in diameter ? it will generally pass in a few days . Bigger stones call for medical assistance . Until 1984 , surgery was the only form of medical help . Since then , about 160 lithotripsy machines , most of them made by the West German firm Dornier Medical Systems , have been installed in the U.S. , and virtually all stone sufferers now undergo the procedure . A lithotripsy patient is usually given general anesthesia and lowered up to the neck into a stainlesssteel tank of warm water . Guided by X-ray monitors , the doctor positions the patient so the stone is at the focus of an intense sound wave . The wave is set off by a 1,800-to-2,400-volt underwater spark charge and directed at the stone by a brass reflector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's watery tissues , so the sound wave cracks it apart . Depending on the stone 's size and density , one treatment involves 800 to 1,500 shocks , followed by a night or two in the hospital . For about 80 percent of patients with kidney stones , lithotripsy works well . But a 13-member National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) panel recently concluded that it should n't be used for all stones . Experts liken the power of the shock waves to that of a .45-caliber slug , a force that bruises the cells of the kidney and the nearby liver , pancreas , muscle and gastrointestinal tract . This damage and the lack of information about long-term side effects led the panel to urge caution : Lithotripsy should be employed against stones no larger than 2 centimeters , or about 3/4 inch ? and rarely on children , because of the unknown effects of shock waves on still growing kidneys . " Everybody 's got reservations , especially about its use in children , " says Dr. Fredric Coe , the panel 's chairman and director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIH panel recommendations are the first restrictions proposed on lithotripsy . For stones larger than 2 centimeters , the panel proposed that doctors use  | percutaneous surgery , a " minimal surgery " technique introduced in the early 1980s . A tube passed through a small incision in the side of the body uses lasers or tightly focused shock waves to break up the stone into small pieces that are then excreted from the body . Lithotripsy is recommended for stubborn fragments . For the less than 1 percent of patients whose stones are particularly large or infected , or totally block urine flow , most experts recommend major surgery . The NIH panel sounded other warnings as well ? for example , that repeated lithotripsy treatments may also lead to high blood pressure . Researchers believe that scar tissue , formed as the kidney heals from lithotripsy-inflicted bruises , compresses the kidney and lowers blood flow . The body then tries to increase circulation by raising blood pressure . But that 's only one scenario ; the different definitions for high blood pressure and the lack of rigorous studies make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . The first answers should come by fall from the Methodist Hospital Institute for Kidney Stone Disease in Indianapolis , where Dr. James Lingeman is studying the effects of different treatments on some 1,500 patients who were treated for kidney stones . The NIH panel also called for more-extensive studies . In response to these concerns , manufacturers are making some changes . Dornier and others are developing new models with reflectors that more precisely focus the shock wave and use less power , thus reducing cell damage to the kidney and other organs . Some devices , being developed to treat gallbladder stones , could help wipe out many of the 500,000 annual operations to remove gallbladders because of gallstones . Current shock-wave technology ca n't be used on gallstones ; they 're usually made of cholesterol , not calcium , so they 're invisible on an X-ray . Devices for gallstones employ ultrasound to see them . Gallstone removal has to be helped along with drugs that dissolve stone  | fragments and increase the flow of bile from the gallbladder , which is significantly less than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help prevent kidney stones from returning . As the NIH panel noted : " It is particularly important that patients with stones , whether treated with shock-wave lithotripsy or not , receive ... medical therapy and monitoring to prevent or delay recurrence . " Two kinds of prescription drugs can cut recurrences in half : Thiazide diuretics work successfully against high calcium , and allopurinol helps keep down the level of uric acid , which contributes to stone formation . The side effects of both classes of drugs are mild and easily kept in check with regular monitoring . A half-dozen other prescription agents may be useful but are unproved . Doctors can use seven laboratory tests to check for conditions that contribute to kidney stones and to aid in choosing the drug or combination of drugs that might work best . Nothing can guarantee that you 'll never be attacked by a kidney stone , or that if you are , it will simply take care of itself . But at least modern medicine can remove the source of the suffering . Only a century ago , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
