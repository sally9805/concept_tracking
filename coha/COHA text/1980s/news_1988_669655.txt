Yet rarely have so many members of Congress voiced so many frustrations about the institution in which they serve . And never have they had so many responsibilities to shoulder. // As a result , Congress is in the midst of a period of change as far-reaching as any in recent history , one that to a great extent will determine how this country will be run through the 1990s and into the next century. // But it is not the sort of change of which headlines are easily written . In the wake of the Vietnam War and Watergate scandals , lawmakers instituted a series of changes that transformed venerable congressional practices and shifted the balance of power from the executive to the legislative branches . That was revolutionary stuff , triggering furious debate and commanding great publicity. // Today ' s changes are more subtle , yet , at the same time , more inexorable . Many of them spring from those very changes wrought in the 1970s . An increase in congressional staff , for example , has brought lawmakers an enormous amount of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , has brought an increased tendency to confront the executive branch on matters of foreign and domestic policy that , in an earlier age , Congress would have left alone. // Other changes spring from larger factors . Consider , for example , the forces at work on the Senate. // The polarization of national party politics , the breakdown of party discipline , and the difficulties of dealing with budget deficits have affected both houses of Congress . But the influence of these developments is felt most dramatically in the Senate , where tradition and law provides members with considerably more individual latitude than in the House of Representatives. // Senior members express frustration over a breakdown in the Senate ' s famed comity . Newcomers express bewilderment at Senate rules , crafted for a more genteel age , that allow a determined minority to bring the US government to a virtual standstill. // Young and old alike fret that the Senate has degenerated from the legislative aristocracy envisioned by the founding fathers to something on the order of a raucus town council , where almost anything warrants furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted ruefully that recent wrangling between the Congress and the White House over contra aid excluded the Senate entirely : House leaders were able to combat the Reagan administration ' s contra aid proposal with a counter-proposal of their own ; Senate leaders , on the other hand , were unable to get anything approaching a consensus. // Dozens of proposals have surfaced to streamline Senate procedures . A few would improve the ' ' quality of life ' ' of members , who complain the Senate ' s tumultuousness prevents them from enjoying any semblance of a normal existence . But those proposals seem unlikely to insulate the Senate from the conditions that have reduced its effectiveness in recent years . Ironically , many of the same developments that bedeviled the Senate have contributed to the House ' s recent rise in prestige and influence. // For more than a generation , Democrats have controlled the House and Republicans have been consigned to the status of ' ' permanent minority . ' ' The Democrats are likely to continue to dominate for some time , if only because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , and media attention - that accrue to incumbents. // During some of the highly charged confrontations of the Reagan era , Democratic leaders have become increasingly skilled at ' ' party politics ' ' - steamrolling Republican objections with an overwhelming Democratic majority . As a result , the House has become a place where Democratic policy positions are written into legislation , rather than a place where parties compete to elevate their ideas into law. // That makes the House a much more efficient place to legislate than the Senate and , indeed , as in the case of the contra aid debate , the House is increasingly assuming the policy making role once reserved largely for the other body. // But such efficiency has its price . The House minority is disaffected and , to a significant extent , embittered by what it sees as the Democratic leadership ' s hard-ball style of politicking . So they have pledged themselves to derailing the Democrats ' agenda. // The result is conflict and confrontation that , all too often , has little to do with any real legislating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve a fight between Republicans and Democrats over whether or not it was time to go home. // This year , commentators marveled over the fact that Democrats and Republicans were able to vote together on a spending blueprint for the federal government ; in previous years , such budget plans triggered searing partisan fights , although both sides ended up voting for budget plans. // When Ronald Reagan leaves town , will these sorts of battles subside ? Many commentators argue that this is so . President Reagan brought with him to office a political agenda that was certain to ruffle feathers in Washington . A less ideologically charged presidency would help smooth relations between the branches and between parties. // But the tensions would still remain . ' ' I don ' t think this place will ever be peaceful , ' ' says Rep. Jamie Whitten ( D ) of Mississippi , the most senior member of Congress . ' ' That ' s not what it is about.
