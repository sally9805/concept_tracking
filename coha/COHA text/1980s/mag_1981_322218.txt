" <P> " My Little Margie , complete . " The Consumer 's cigarette stuck to his dry lips , and he burned his finger trying to rescue it . " Twilight Zone . Gilligan 's Island and The Muppets for the kids . I videotaped the royal wedding but I erased it . " <P> The Detective leaned in . " Erase them , keep them . No difference . How many shows you tape with your Betamax ? " <P> " I do n't know , " the Consumer said . <P> " Some . Maybe a lot . " <P> " You 've had it , " the man from the D.A . ' s office interrupted . " You broke the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For what ? Since when ? And do n't call me Pirate . " <P> " For infringing on the rights of the copyright owners . " <P> " But it was only for my own private use . Me and the family . There was a court decision . In Los Angeles . In 1979 . It said if you do n't charge admission or try to make a profit off the copyrighted material .. <P> " Forget it , " the Detective snarled . <P> " Do n't you read the papers ? " <P> " It was on television too , " the D.A . ' s man sneered . " But maybe you were too busy taping to see it . Last week . In San Francisco .

" I 'm busy . " <P> " You 're busy ? " the Junior Partner said . " There 's about 3 million people in this country who own videotape recorders and I think we got calls from every one of them . " He pulled papers from his briefcase like Kleenex from a box . " You know Sony expects to take this to the Supreme Court . " <P> " Well , it was Universal City Studios and Walt Disney Productions that initiated the action against them , and they 'll be there too , " said the Detective . The D.A . ' s man was incredulous . " You 'd go to court against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong case , " said the Junior Partner .

' s man . <P> The Junior Partner paid no attention . <P> " Also the federal judge in San Francisco has n't awarded any damages yet , so there is no provision for penalties .
