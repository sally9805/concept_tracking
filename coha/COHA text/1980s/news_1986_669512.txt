The French government ' s Ministry of Tourism classifies the hotels here , and the best guide you can get is the free one it puts out , the Guide des Hotels Martine Gerard . This publication lists the hotel ' s address and phone number , rating , number of rooms , prices for single and double rooms , and other information such as access for the handicapped , TV in the room , or what credit cards are accepted. // The ratings range from one-star at the low end of the ladder to four-star deluxe . The rating doesn ' t attempt to gauge the charm of the hotel but its services - whether it has an elevator , room service , someone to carry your bags ( expect this only in the grandest ) , several maids , and so on. // // Staying in the cheapest room of a one-star hotel , for instance , might mean climbing up several flights of stars to get to your very clean but tiny chamber , which has a shower in the corner and a toilet down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , can hold its own with any deluxe hotel in the world . Most of the hotels I visited recently were rated three-stars - ' ' very comfortable. ' ' // Reservations are essential , even in off-season months like September , October , April , and May - popular times for conventions , fashion shows , and trade fairs here . To make a reservation , call the hotel directly . Most have at least one clerk who speaks English . From the United States , dial 011-33-14 for access to Paris , then the number . After calling , send a letter of confirmation with a personal check for the first night . ( For the zip code , put 750 for Paris , then the arrondissement ( arr. ) in two digits - 03 for third , for instance. ) // The most important thing in a hotel , to me , is location . After a hard day of touring , I like to pop ' ' home ' ' for a washup and a change of clothes before dinner . I like staying near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral , so I concentrated on hotels in this area . One advantage : these districts have many restaurants - a crucial consideration , as there are none in the hotels. // Each hotel listed below has a certain charm ( ideal for the middle-of-the-road tourist who wants a bit of glamour ) , and prices range from a low of $35 to a high of $116 , with the average around $58 .
