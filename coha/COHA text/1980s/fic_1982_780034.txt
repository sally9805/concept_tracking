 | Business school was an exciting new adventure . When Kate had gone to Cheltenham , it had been a chore , a necessary evil . This was different . Every class taught her something useful , something that would help her when she ran the company . The courses included accounting , management , international trade and business administration . Once a week David telephoned to see how she was getting along . " I love it , " Kate told him . " It 's really exciting , David . " One day she and David would be working together , side by side , late at night , all by themselves . And one of those nights , David would turn to her and say , " Kate , darling , I 've been such a blind fool . Will you marry me ? " And an instant later , she would be in his arms .. . But that would have to wait . In the meantime , she had a lot to learn . Resolutely , Kate turned to her homework . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klipdrift in time to celebrate her twentieth birthday . David met her at the station . Impulsively , Kate flung her arms around him and hugged him . " Oh , David , I 'm so happy to see you . "  | He pulled away and said awkwardly , " It 's nice to see you , Kate . " There was an uncomfortable stiffness in his manner . " Is something wrong ? " " No . It 's  --  it 's just that young ladies do n't go around hugging men in public . " She looked at him a moment . " I see . I promise not to embarrass you again . " As they drove to the house , David covertly studied Kate . She was a hauntingly beautiful girl , innocent and vulnerable , and David was determined that he would never take advantage of that . On Monday morning Kate moved into her new office at Kruger-Brent , Ltd . It was like suddenly being plunged into some exotic and bizarre universe that had its own customs and its own language . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments , franchises and foreign branches . The products that the company manufactured or owned seemed endless . There were steel mills , cattle ranches , a railroad , a shipping line and , of course , the foundation of the family fortune : diamonds and gold , zinc and platinum and magnesium , mined each hour around the clock , pouring into the coffers of the company . Power . It was almost too much to take in . Kate sat in David 's office listening to him make decisions that affected thousands of people around the world . The general managers of the various divisions made recommendations , but as often as not , David overruled them . " Why do you do that ? Do n't they know their jobs ? " Kate asked . " Of course they do , but that 's not the point , " David explained . " Each manager sees his own division as the center of the world , and that 's as it should be . But someone has to have an overall view and decide what 's best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with someone I want you to meet . "  | David took Kate into the large , private dining room adjoining Kate 's office . A young , raw-boned man with a lean face and inquisitive brown eyes was waiting for them . " This is Brad Rogers , " David said . " Brad , meet your new boss , Kate McGregor . " Brad Rogers held out his hand . " I 'm pleased to meet you , Miss McGregor . " " Brad is our secret weapon , " David said . " He knows as much about Kruger-Brent , Limited , as I do . If I ever leave , you do n't have to worry . Brad will be here . " If I ever leave . The thought of it sent a wave of panic through Kate . Of course , David would never leave the company . Kate could think of nothing else through lunch , and when it was over she had no idea what she had eaten . After lunch , they discussed South Africa . " We 're going to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has just imposed poll taxes . " " Exactly what does that mean ? " Kate asked . " It means that blacks , coloreds and Indians have to pay two pounds each for every member of their family . That 's more than a month 's wages for them . " Kate thought about Banda and was filled with a sense of apprehension . The discussion moved on to other topics . Kate enjoyed her new life tremendously . Every decision involved a gamble of millions of pounds . Big business was a matching of wits , the courage to gamble and the instinct to know when to quit and when to press ahead . " Business is a game , " David told Kate , " played for fantastic stakes , and you 're in competition with experts . If you want to win , you have to learn to be a master of the game . " And that was what Kate was determined to do . Learn . Kate lived alone in the big house , except for the servants . She and David continued their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on any other night , he invariably found an excuse not to come . During business hours they were together constantly , but even then David seemed to have erected a barrier between them , a wall that Kate was unable to penetrate . On her twenty-first birthday , all the shares in Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , were turned over to Kate . She now officially had control of the company . " Let 's have dinner tonight to celebrate , " she suggested to David . " I 'm sorry , Kate , I have a lot of work to catch up on . " Kate dined alone that night , wondering why . Was it she , or was it David ? He would have to be deaf , dumb and blind not to know how she felt about him , how she had always felt about him . She would have to do something about it . The company was negotiating for a shipping line in the United States . " Why do n't you and Brad go to New York and close the deal ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience for you . " Kate would have liked for David to have gone with her , but she was too proud to say so . She would handle this without him . Besides , she had never been to America . She looked forward to the experience . The closing of the shipping-line deal went smoothly .. " While you 're over there , " David had told her , " you should see something of the country . " Kate and Brad visited company subsidiaries in Detroit , Chicago , Pittsburgh and New York , and Kate was amazed by the size and energy of the United States . The highlight of Kate 's trip was a visit to Dark Harbor , Maine , on an enchanting little island called Islesboro , in Penobscot Bay . She had been invited to dinner at the home of Charles Dana Gibson , the artist . There were twelve people at dinner and , except for Kate , they all had homes on the island . " This place has an interesting history , " Gibson told Kate .  | " Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels from Boston . When the boat landed , they 'd be met by a buggy and taken to their houses . " " How many people live on this island ? " Kate asked . " About fifty families . Did you see the lighthouse when the ferry docked ? " " Yes . " " It 's run by a lighthouse keeper and his dog . When a boat goes by the dog goes out and rings the bell . " Kate laughed . " You 're joking . " " No , ma'am . The funny thing is the dog is deaf as a stone . He puts his ear against the bell to feel if there 's any vibration . " Kate smiled . " It sounds as if you have a fascinating island here . " " It might be worth your while staying over and taking a look around in the morning . " On an impulse , Kate said , " Why not ? " She spent the night at the island 's only hotel , the Islesboro Inn . In the morning she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islanders . They left the center of Dark Harbor , which consisted of a general store , a hardware store and a small restaurant , and a few minutes later they were driving through a beautiful wooded area . Kate noticed that none of the little winding roads had names , nor were there any names on the mailboxes . She turned to her guide . " Do n't people get lost here without any signs ? " " Nope . The islanders know where everythin ' is . " Kate gave him a sidelong look . " I see . " At the lower end of the island , they passed a burial ground . " Would you stop , please ? " Kate asked . She stepped out of the carriage and walked over to the old cemetery and wandered around looking at the tombstones . JOB PENDLETON , DIED JANUARY 25 , 1794 , AGE 47 . The epitaph read : Beneath this stone , I rest my head in slumber sweet ; Christ blessed the bed .  | JANE , WIFE OF THOMAS PENDLETON , DIED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits here from another century , from an era long gone . CAPTAIN WILLIAM HATCH DROWNED IN LONG ISLAND SOUND , OCTOBER 1866 , AGE 30 YEARS . The epitaph on his stone read : Storms all weathered and life 's seas crossed . Kate stayed there a long time , enjoying the quiet and peace . Finally , she returned to the carriage and they drove on . " What is it like here in the winter ? " Kate asked . " Cold . The bay used to freeze solid , and they 'd come from the mainland by sleigh . Now a ' course , we got the ferry . " They rounded a curve , and there , next to the water below , was a beautiful white-shingled , two-story house surrounded by delphinium , wild roses and poppies . The shutters on the eight front windows were painted green , and next to the double doors were white benches and six pots of red geraniums . It looked like something out of a fairy tale . " Who owns that house ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months back . " " Who lives there now ? " " Nobody , I reckon . " " Do you know if it 's for sale ? " The guide looked at Kate and said , " If it is , it 'll probably be bought by the son of one of the families already livin ' here . The islanders do n't take kindly to strangers . " It was the wrong thing to say to Kate . One hour later , she was speaking to a lawyer for the estate . " It 's about the Dreben house , " Kate said . " Is it for sale ? " The lawyer pursed his lips . " Well , yes , and no . " " What does that mean ? " " It 's for sale , but a few people are already interested in buying it . " The old families on the island , Kate thought . " Have they made an offer ? " " Not yet , but ? "  | " I 'm making one , " Kate said . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Name your price . " " Fifty thousand dollars . " " Let 's go look at it . " The inside of the house was even more enchanting than Kate had anticipated . The large , lovely hall faced the sea through a wall of glass . On one side of the hall was a large ballroom , and on the other side , a living room with fruitwood paneling stained by time and an enormous fireplace . There was a library , and a huge kitchen with an iron stove and a large pine worktable , and off of that was a butler 's pantry and laundry room . Downstairs , the house had six bedrooms for the servants and one bathroom . Upstairs was a master bedroom suite and four smaller bedrooms . It was a much larger house than Kate had expected . But when David and I have our children , she thought , we 'll need all these rooms . The grounds ran all the way down to the bay , where there was a private dock . Kate turned to the lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name it Cedar Hill House . She could not wait to get back to Klipdrift to break the news to David . On the way back to South Africa , Kate was filled with a wild excitement . The house in Dark Harbor was a sign , a symbol that she and David would be married . She knew he would love the house as much as she did . On the afternoon Kate and Brad arrived back in Klipdrift , Kate hurried to David 's office . He was seated at his desk , working , and the sight of him set Kate 's heart pounding . She had not realized how much she had missed him . David rose to his feet . " Kate ! Welcome home ! " And before she could speak , he said , " I wanted you to be the first to know . I 'm getting married . "  | It had begun casually six weeks earlier . In the middle of a hectic day , David received a message that Tim O'Neil , the friend of an important American diamond buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough to welcome him and perhaps take him to dinner . David had no time to waste on tourists , but he did not want to offend his customer . He would have asked Kate to entertain the visitor , but she was on a tour of the company 's plants in North America with Brad Rogers . I 'm stuck , David decided . He called the hotel where O'Neil was staying and invited him to dinner that evening . " My daughter is with me , " O'Neil told him . " I hope you do n't mind if I bring her along ? " David was in no mood to spend the evening with a child . " Not at all , " he said politely . He would make sure the evening was a short one . They met at the Grand Hotel , in the dining room . When David arrived , O'Neil and his daughter were already seated at the table . O'Neil was a handsome , gray-haired Irish-American in his early fifties . His daughter , Josephine , was the most beautiful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties ,  | with a stunning figure , soft blond hair and clear blue eyes . The breath went out of David at the sight of her . " I  --  I 'm sorry I 'm late , " he said . " Some last-minute business . " Josephine watched his reaction to her with amusement . " Sometimes that 's the most exciting kind , " she said innocently . " My father tells me you 're a very important man , Mr. Blackwell . " " Not really  --  and it 's David . " She nodded . " That 's a good name . It suggests great strength . " Before the dinner was over , David decided that Josephine O'Neil was much more than just a beautiful woman . She was intelligent , had a sense of humor and was skillful at making him feel at ease . David felt she was genuinely interested in him . She asked him questions about himself that no one had ever asked before . By the time the evening ended , he was already half in love with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neil . " San Francisco . " " Will you be going back soon ? " He made it sound as casual as he could . " Next week . " Josephine smiled at David . " If Klipdrift is as interesting as it promises to be , I might persuade Father to stay a little longer . " " I intend to make it as interesting as possible , " David assured her . " How would you like to go down into a diamond mine ? " " We 'd love it , " Josephine answered . " Thank you . " At one time David had personally escorted important visitors down into the mines , but he had long since delegated that task to subordinates . Now he heard himself saying , " Would tomorrow morning be convenient ? " He had half a dozen meetings scheduled for the morning , but they suddenly seemed unimportant . He took the O'Neils down a rockshaft , twelve hundred feet below ground . The shaft was six feet wide and twenty feet long , divided into four compartments , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one with a double-  | decked cage to carry the miners to and from work . " I 've always been curious about something , " Josephine said . " Why are diamonds measured in carats ? " " The carat was named for the carob seed , " David explained , " because of its consistency in weight . One carat equals two hundred milligrams , or one one-hundred-forty-second of an ounce . " Josephine said , " I 'm absolutely fascinated , David . " And he wondered if she was referring only to the diamonds . Her nearness was intoxicating . Every time he looked at Josephine , David felt a fresh sense of excitement . " You really should see something of the countryside , " David told the O'Neils . " If you 're free tomorrow , I 'd be happy to take you around . " Before her father could say anything , Josephine replied , " That would be lovely . " David was with Josephine and her father every day after that , and each day David fell more deeply in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David arrived to pick up the O'Neils for dinner one evening and Tim O'Neil said , " I 'm a bit tired tonight , David . Would you mind if I did n't go along ? " David tried to hide his pleasure . " No , sir . I understand . " Josephine gave David a mischievous smile . " I 'll try to keep you entertained , " she promised . David took her to a restaurant in a hotel that had just opened . The room was crowded , but David was recognized and given a table immediately . A three-piece ensemble was playing American music . David asked , " Would you like to dance ? " " I 'd love to . " A moment later , Josephine was in his arms on the dance floor , and it was magic . David held her lovely body close to his , and he could feel her respond . " Josephine , I 'm in love with you . "  | She put a finger to his lips . " Please , David ... do n't ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you . " " Do you love me ? " She smiled up at him , her blue eyes sparkling . " I 'm crazy about you , my darling . Ca n't you tell ? " " Then why ? " " Because I could never live in Klipdrift . I 'd go mad . " " You could give it a try . " " David , I 'm tempted , but I know what would happen . If I married you and had to live here , I 'd turn into a screaming shrew and we 'd end up hating each other . I 'd rather we said good-bye this way . " " I do n't want to say good-bye . " She looked up into his face , and David felt her body melt into his . " David , is there any chance that you could live in San Fran-cisco ? " It was an impossible idea . " What would I do there ? " " Let 's have breakfast in the morning . I want you to talk to Father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your conversation last night . Looks like you two have a problem . But I might have a solution , if you 're interested . " " I 'm very interested , sir . " O'Neil picked up a brown-leather briefcase and removed some blueprints . " Do you know anything about frozen foods ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't . " " They first started freezing food in the United States in 1865 . The problem was transporting it long distances without the food thawing out . We 've got refrigerated railway cars , but no one 's been able to come up with a way to refrigerate trucks . " O'Neil tapped the blueprints . " Until now . I just received a patent on it . This is going to revolutionize the entire food industry , David . " David glanced at the blueprints . " I 'm afraid these do n't mean much to me , Mr. O'Neil . " " That does n't matter . I 'm not looking for a technical expert . I  | have plenty of those . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . This is n't some wild pipe dream . I 've talked to the top food processors in the business . This is going to be big  --  bigger than you can imagine . I need someone like you . " " The company headquarters will be in San Francisco , " Josephine added . David sat there silent , digesting what he had just heard . " You say you 've been given a patent on this ? " " That 's right . I 'm all set to move . " " Would you mind if I borrowed these blueprints and showed them to someone ? " " I have no objection at all . " The first thing David did was to check on Tim O'Neil . He learned that O'Neil had a solid reputation in San Francisco . He had been head of the science department at a Berkeley College there and was highly regarded . David knew nothing about the freezing of food , but he intended to find out . " I 'll be back in five days , darling . I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as you like . I 'll miss you , " Josephine said . " I 'll miss you , too . " And he meant it more than she knew . David took the train to Johannesburg and made an appointment to see Edward Broderick , the owner of the largest meatpacking plant in South Africa . " I want your opinion on something . " David handed him the blueprints . " I need to know if this can work . " " I do n't know a damned thing about frozen foods or trucks , but I know people who do . If you come back this afternoon , I 'll have a couple of experts here for you , David . " At four o'clock that afternoon David returned to the packing plant . He found that he was nervous , in a state of uncertainty , because he was not sure how he wanted the meeting to go . Two weeks earlier , he would have laughed if anyone had even sug-  | gested he would ever leave Kruger-Brent , Ltd . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had told him he would have considered heading a little food company in San Francisco . It was insane , except for one thing : Josephine O'Neil . There were two men in the room with Edward Broderick . " This is Dr. Crawford and Mr. Kaufman . David Blackwell . " They exchanged greetings . David asked , " Have you gentlemen had a chance to look at the blueprints ? " Dr. Crawford replied , " We certainly have , Mr. Blackwell . We 've been over them thoroughly . " David took a deep breath . " And ? " " I understand that the United States Patent Office has granted a patent on this ? " " That 's right . " " Well , Mr. Blackwell , whoever got that patent is going to be one very rich man . " David nodded slowly , filled with conflicting emotions . " It 's like all great inventions  --  it 's so simple you wonder why someone did n't think of it sooner . This one ca n't miss . " David did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be taken out of his hands . If Tirn O'Neil 's invention was useless , there was a chance of persuading Josephine to stay in South Africa . But what O'Neil had told him was true . It did work . Now David had to make his decision . He thought of nothing else on the journey back to Klipdrift . If he accepted , it would mean leaving the company , starting up a new , untried business . He was an American , but America was a foreign country to him . He held an important position in one of the most powerful companies in the world . He loved his job . Jamie and Margaret McGregor had been very good to him . And then there was Kate . He had cared for her since she was a baby . He had watched her grow up from a stubborn , dirty-faced tomboy to a lovely young woman . Her life was a photo album in his mind . He turned the pages and there was Kate at four , eight , ten , fourteen , twenty-one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at Klipdrift , David had made up  | his mind . He was not going to leave Kruger-Brent , Ltd . He drove directly to the Grand Hotel and went up to the O'Neils ' suite . Josephine opened the door for him . " David ! " He took her in his arms and kissed her hungrily , feeling her warm body pressing against his . " Oh , David , I 've missed you so much . I do n't ever want to be away from you again . " " You wo n't have to , " David said slowly . " I 'm going to San Francisco ... " David had waited with growing anxiety for Kate to return from the United States . Now that he had made his decision , he was eager to get started on his new life , impatient to marry Josephine . And now Kate was back , and he was standing in front of her saying , " I 'm getting married . " Kate heard the words through a roaring in her ears . She felt suddenly faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . I want to die , she thought . Please let me die . Somehow , from some deep wellspring of will , she managed a smile . " Tell me about her , David . " She was proud of how calm her voice sounded . " Who is she ? " " Her name is Josephine O'Neil . She 's been visiting here with her father . I know you two will be good friends , Kate . She 's a fine woman . " " She must be , if you love her , David . " He hesitated . " There 's one more thing , Kate . I 'm going to be leaving the company . " The world was falling in on her . " Just because you 're getting married , does n't mean you have to ? " " It is n't that . Josephine 's father is starting a new business in San Francisco . They need me . " " So  --  so you 'll be living in San Francisco . " " Yes . Brad Rogers can handle my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to back him up . Kate , I  --  I ca n't tell you what a difficult decision this was for me. "  | " Of course , David . You  --  you must love her very much . When do I get to meet the bride ? " David smiled , pleased at how well Kate was taking the news . " Tonight , if you 're free for dinner . " " Yes , I 'm free . " She would not let the tears come until she was alone . The four of them had dinner at the McGregor mansion . The moment Kate saw Josephine , she blanched , Oh God ! No wonder he 's in love with her ! She was dazzling . Just being in her presence made Kate feel awkward and ugly . And to make matters worse , Josephine was gracious and charming . And obviously very much in love with David . Bloody hell ! During dinner Tim O'Neil told Kate about the new company . " It sounds very interesting , " Kate said . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to start small , but with David running it , we 'll do all right . " " With David running it , you ca n't miss , " Kate assured him . The evening was an agony . In the same cataclysmic moment , she had lost the man she loved and the one person who was indispensable to Kruger-Brent , Ltd . She carried on a conversation and managed to get through the evening , but afterward she had no recollection of what she said or did . She only knew that every time David and Josephine looked at each other or touched , she wanted to kill herself . On the way back to the hotel , Josephine said , " She 's in love with you , David . " He smiled . " Kate ? No . We 're friends . We have been since she was a baby . She liked you a lot . " Josephine smiled . Men are so naive . In David 's office the following morning , Tim O'Neil and David sat facing each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order here , " David said . " I 've been thinking about the financing we 'll need to begin with . If we go to one of the big companies , they 'll swallow us up and give us a small share . It  | wo n't belong to us anymore . I think we should finance it ourselves . I figure it will cost eighty thousand dollars to get started . I 've saved the equivalent of about forty thousand dollars . We 'll need forty thousand more . " " I have ten thousand dollars , " Tim O'Neil said . " And I have a brother who will loan me another five thousand . " " So , we 're twenty-five thousand dollars short , " David said . " We 'll try to borrow that from a bank . " " We 'll leave for San Francisco right away , " O'Neil told David , " and get everything set up for you . " Josephine and her father left for the United States two days later . " Send them to Cape Town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's very generous of you , Kate . " The morning Josephine left , David felt as though a piece of his life had been taken away . He could not wait to join her in San Francisco . The next few weeks were taken up with a search for a management team to back up Brad Rogers . A list of possible candidates was carefully drawn up , and Kate and David and Brad spent hours discussing each one . " ... Taylor is a good technician , but he 's weak on management . " " What about Simmons ? " " He 's good , but he 's not ready yet , " Brad decided . " Give him another five years . " " Babcock ? " " Not a bad choice . Let 's discuss him . " " What about Peterson ? " " Not enough of a company man , " David said . " He 's too concerned with himself . " And even as he said it , he felt a pang of guilt because he was deserting Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the end of the month , they had narrowed the choice to four men to work with Brad Rogers . All of them were working abroad , and they were  | sent for so that they could be interviewed . The first two interviews went well . " I 'd be satisfied with either one of them , " Kate assured David and Brad . On the morning the third interview was to take place , David walked into Kate 's office , his face pale . " Is my job still open ? " Kate looked at his expression and stood up in alarm . " What is it , David ? " " I  --  I ? " He sank into a chair . " Something has happened . " Kate was out from behind the desk and by his side in an instant . " Tell me ! " " I just got a letter from Tim O'Neil . He 's sold the business . " " What do you mean ? " " Exactly what I said . He accepted an offer of two hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Meat Packing Company in Chicago . " David 's voice was filled with bitterness . " The company would like to hire me to manage it for them . He regrets any inconvenience to me , but he could n't turn down that kind of money . " Kate looked at him intently . " And Josephine ? What does she say ? She must be furious with her father . " " There was a letter from her , too . We 'll marry as soon as I come to San Francisco . " " And you 're not going ? " " Of course I 'm not going ! " David exploded . " Before , I had something to offer . I could have built it into a great company . But they were in too much of a damned hurry for the money . " " David , you 're not being fair when you say they . ' Just be ? " " O'Neil would never have made that deal without Josephine 's approval . " " I  --  I do n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Except that I almost made the biggest mistake of my life . " Kate walked over to the desk and picked up the list of candidates . Slowly , she began to tear it up . In the weeks that followed , David plunged himself deeply into his work , trying to forget his bitterness and hurt . He re-  | ceived several letters from Josephine O'Neil , and he threw them all away , unread . But he could not get her out of his mind . Kate , deeply aware of David 's pain , let him know she was there if he needed her . Six months had passed since David received the letter from Tim O'Neil . During that time , Kate and David continued to work closely together , travel together and be alone together much of the time . Kate tried to please him in every way she could . She dressed for him , planned things he would enjoy and went out of her way to make his life as happy as possible . As far as she could tell , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her patience . She and David were in Rio de Janeiro , checking on a new mineral find . They had had dinner at their hotel and were in Kate 's room going over some figures late at night . Kate had changed to a comfortable kimono and slippers . When they finished , David stretched and said , " Well , that 's it for tonight . I guess I 'll go on to bed . " Kate said quietly , " Is n't it time you came out of mourning , David ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Mourning ? " " For Josephine O'Neil . " " She 's out of my life . " " Then act like it . " " Just what would you like me to do , Kate ? " he asked curtly . Kate was angry now . Angry at David 's blindness , angry about all the wasted time . " I 'll tell you what I 'd like you to do ? kiss me . " " What ? " " Bloody hell , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved close to him . " Kiss me . " And she pressed her lips against his and put her arms around him . She felt him resist and start to draw back . And then slowly his arms circled her body , and he kissed her . " Kate ... "  | She whispered against his lips . " I thought you 'd never ask ... " They were married six weeks later . It was the biggest wedding Klipdrift had ever seen or would see again . It was held in the town 's largest church and afterward there was a reception in the town hall and everyone was invited . There were mountains of food and uncounted cases of beer and whiskey and champagne , and musicians played and the festivities lasted until dawn . When the sun came up , Kate and David slipped away . " I 'll go home and finish packing , " Kate said . " Pick me up in an hour . " In the pale dawn light , Kate entered the huge house alone and went upstairs to her bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed against the frame . The painting flew back , revealing a wall safe . She opened it and brought out a contract . It was for the purchase of the Three Star Meat Packing Company of Chicago by Kate McGregor . Next to it was a contract from the Three Star Meat Packing Company purchasing the rights to Tim O'Neil 's freezing process for two hundred thousand dollars . Kate hesitated a moment , then returned the papers to the safe and locked it . David belonged to her now . He had always belonged to her . And to Kruger-Brent , Ltd . Together , they would build it into the biggest , most powerful company in the world . Just as Jamie and Margaret McGregor would have wanted it .  | They were in the library , where Jamie had once liked to sit with his brandy glass in front of him . David was arguing that there was no time for a real honeymoon . " Someone has to mind the store , Kate . " " Yes , Mr. Blackwell . But who 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lap , and he felt the warmth of her through her thin dress . The documents he had been reading fell to the floor . Her arms were around him , and he felt her hands sliding down his body . She pressed her hips against him , making slow , small circles , and the papers on the floor were forgotten . She felt him respond , and she rose and slipped out of her dress . David watched her , marveling at her loveliness . How could he have been so blind for so long ? She was undressing him now , and there was a sudden urgency in him . They were both naked , and their bodies were pressed together . He stroked her , his fingers lightly touching her face and her neck , down to the swell of her breasts . She was moaning , and his hands moved down until he felt the velvety softness between her legs . His fingers stroked her and she whispered , " Take me , David , " and they were on the deep , soft rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her .  | There was a long , sweet thrust and he was inside her , filling her , and she moved to his rhythm . It became a great tidal wave , sweeping her up higher and higher until she thought she could not bear the ecstasy of it . There was a sudden , glorious explosion deep inside her and another and another , and she thought , I 've died and gone to heaven . They traveled all over the world , to Paris and Zurich and Sydney and New York , taking care of company business , but wherever they went they carved out moments of time for themselves . They talked late into the night and made love and explored each other 's minds and bodies . Kate was an inexhaustible delight to David . She would awaken him in the morning to make wild and pagan love to him , and a few hours later she would be at his side at a business conference , making more sense than anyone else there . She had a natural flair for business that was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top echelons of the business world . In the beginning Kate was treated with a tolerant condescension , but the attitude quickly changed to a wary respect . Kate took a delight in the maneuvering and machinations of the game . David watched her outwit men with much greater experience . She had the instincts of a winner . She knew what she wanted and how to get it . Power . They ended their honeymoon with a glorious week in Cedar Hill House at Dark Harbor . It was on June 28 , 1914 , that the first talk of war was heard . Kate and David were guests at a country estate in Sussex . It was the age of country-house living and weekend guests were expected to conform to a ritual . Men dressed for breakfast , changed for midmorning lounging , changed for lunch , changed for tea  --  to a velvet jacket with satin piping  --  and changed to a formal jacket for dinner . " For God 's sake , " David protested to Kate . " I feel like a damned peacock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my darling , " Kate assured him . " When you get home , you can walk around naked . " He took her in his arms . " I ca n't wait . " At dinner , the news came that Francis Ferdinand , heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne , and his wife , Sophie , had been slain by an assassin . Their host , Lord Maney , said , " Nasty business , shooting a woman , what ? But no one is going to war over some little Balkan country . " And the conversation moved on to cricket . Later in bed , Kate said , " Do you think there 's going to be a war , David ? " " Over some minor archduke being assassinated ? No . " It proved to be a bad guess . Austria-Hungary , suspecting that its neighbor , Serbia , had instigated the plot to assassinate Ferdinand , declared war on Serbia , and by October , most of the world 's major powers were at war . It was a new kind of warfare . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , airships and submarines . The day Germany declared war , Kate said , " This can be a wonderful opportunity for us , David . " David frowned . " What are you talking about ? " " Nations are going to need guns and ammunition and " They 're not getting them from us , " David interrupted firmly . " We have enough business , Kate . We do n't have to make profits from anyone 's blood . " " Are n't you being a bit dramatic ? Someone has to make guns . " " As long as I 'm with this company , it wo n't be us . We wo n't discuss it again , Kate . The subject is closed . " And Kate thought , The bloody hell it is . For the first time in their marriage , they slept apart . Kate thought , How can David be such an idealistic ninny ? And David thought , How can she be so cold-blooded ? The business has changed her . The days that followed were miserable  | for both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did not know how to bridge it . Kate was too proud and headstrong to give in to him because she knew she was right . President Woodrow Wilson had promised to keep the United States out of the war , but as German submarines began torpedoing unarmed passenger ships , and stories of German atrocities spread , pressure began to build up for America to help the Allies . " Make the world safe for democracy , " was the slogan . David had learned to fly in the bush country of South Africa , and when the Lafayette Escadrille was formed in France with American pilots , David went to Kate . " I 've got to enlist . " She was appalled . " No ! It 's not your war ! " " It 's going to be , " David said quietly . " The United States ca n't stay out . I 'm an American . I want to help now . " " You 're forty-six years old ! " " I can still fly a plane , Kate . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no way Kate could dissuade him . They spent the last few days together quietly , their differences forgotten . They loved each other , and that was all that mattered . The night before David was to leave for France , he said , " You and Brad Rogers can run the business as well as I can , maybe better . " " What if something happens to you ? I could n't bear it . " He held her close . " Nothing will happen to me , Kate . I 'll come back to you with all kinds of medals . " He left the following morning . David 's absence was death for Kate . It had taken her so long to win him , and now every second of her day there was the ugly , creeping fear of losing him . He was always with her . She found him in the cadence of a stranger 's voice , the sudden laughter on a quiet street , a phrase , a scent , a song . He was everywhere . She wrote him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , she reread it until it was in tatters . He was well , he wrote . The Germans had air superiority , but that would change .  | There were rumors that America would be helping soon . He would write again when he could . He loved her . Do n't let anything happen to you , my darling . I 'll hate you forever if you do . She tried to forget her loneliness and misery by plunging into work . At the beginning of the war , France and Germany had the best-equipped fighting forces in Europe , but the Allies had far greater manpower , resources and materials . Russia , with the largest army , was badly equipped and poorly commanded . " They all need help , " Kate told Brad Rogers . " They need tanks and guns and ammunition . " Brad Rogers was uncomfortable . " Kate , David does n't think ? " " David is n't here , Brad . It 's up to you and me . " But Brad Rogers knew that what Kate meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand David 's attitude-'I-bout manufacturing armaments . The Allies needed weapons , and Kate felt it was her patriotic duty to supply them . She conferred with the heads of half a dozen friendly nations , and within a year Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , was manufacturing guns and tanks , bombs and ammunition . The company supplied trains and tanks and uniforms and guns . Kruger-Brent was rapidly becoming one of the fastest-growing conglomerates in the world . When Kate saw the most recent revenue figures , she said to Brad Rogers , " Have you seen these ? David will have to admit he was mistaken . " South Africa , meanwhile , was in turmoil . The party leaders had pledged their support to the Allies and accepted responsibility for defending South Africa against Germany , but the majority of Afrikaners opposed the country 's support of Great Britain . They could not forget the past so quickly . In Europe the war was going badly for the Allies . Fighting on the western front reached a standstill . Both sides dug in , protected by trenches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable . Rain filled the dugouts with water and mud , and rats swarmed through the vermin-infested  | trenches . Kate was grateful that David was fighting his war in the air . On April 6 , 1917 , President Wilson declared war , and David 's prediction came true . America began to mobilize . The first American Expeditionary Force under General John J. Pershing began landing in France on June 26 , 1917 . New place names became a part of everyone 's vocabulary : SaintMihiel . . . Chateau-Thierry . . . the Meuse-Argonne . . . Belleau Wood ... Verdun ... The Allies had become an irresistible force , and on November 11 , 1918 , the war was finally over . The world was safe for democracy . David was on his way home . When David disembarked from the troop ship in New York , Kate was there to meet him . They stood staring at each other for one eternal moment , ignoring the noise and the crowds around them , then Kate was in David 's arms . He was thinner and tiredlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've missed him so . She had a thousand questions to ask him , but they could wait . " I 'm taking you to Cedar Hill House , " Kate told him . " It 's a perfect place for you to rest . " Kate had done a great deal with the house in anticipation of David 's arrival home . The large , airy living room had been furnished with twin sofas covered in old rose-and-green floral chintz . Matching down-filled armchairs were grouped around the fireplace . Over the fireplace was a Vlaminck floral canvas , and , on each side of it , dolt sconces . Two sets of French doors opened out onto the veranda , which ran the entire length of the house on three sides , covered with a striped awning . The rooms were bright and airy , and the view of the harbor spectacular . Kate led David through the house , chattering away happily . He seemed strangely quiet . When they had completed the tour , Kate asked , " Do you like what I 've done with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , sit down . I want to talk to you . " She had a sudden sinking feeling . " Is anything wrong ? " " We seem to have become a munitions supplier for half the world . "  | " Wait until you look at the books , " Kate began . " Our profit has ? " " I 'm talking about something else . As I recall , our profit was pretty good before I left . I thought we agreed we would n't get involved in manufacturing war supplies . " Kate felt an anger rising in her . " You agreed . I did n't . " She fought to control it . " Times change , David . We have to change with them . " He looked at her and asked quietly , " Have you changed ? " Lying in bed that night , Kate asked herself whether it was she who had changed , or David . Had she become stronger , or had David become weaker ? She thought about his argument against manufacturing armaments . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply the merchandise to the Allies , and there was an enormous profit in it . What had happened to David 's business sense ? She hat ? always looked up to him as one of the cleverest men she knew . But now , she felt that she was more capable of running the business than David . She spent a sleepless night . In the morning Kate and David had breakfast and walked around the grounds . " It 's really lovely , " David told her . " I 'm glad to be here . " Kate said , " About our conversation last night ? " " It 's done . I was away , and you did what you thought was right . " Would I have done the same thing if you had been here ? Kate wondered . But she did not say the words aloud . She had done what she had for the sake of the company . Does the company mean more to me than my marriage ? She was afraid to answer the question .  | The next five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ltd. , had been founded on diamonds and gold , but it had diversified and expanded all over the world , so that its center was no longer South Africa . The company recently had acquired a publishing empire , an insurance company and half a million acres of timberland . One night Kate nudged David awake . " Darling , let 's move the company headquarters . " David sat up groggily . " W  --  what ? " " The business center of the world today is New York . That 's where our headquarters should be . South Africa 's too far away from everything . Besides , now that we have the telephone and cable , we can communicate with any of our offices in minutes . " " Now why did n't I think of that ? " David mumbled . And he went back to sleep . New York was an exciting new world . On her previous visits there , Kate had felt the quick pulse of the city , but living there was like being caught up at the center of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything moved at a more rapid pace . Kate and David selected a site for the new company headquarters on Wall Street , and the architects went to work . Kate chose another architect to design a sixteenth-century French Renaissance mansion on Fifth Avenue . " This city is so damned noisy , " David complained . And it was true . The chatter of riveters filled the air in every part of the city as skyscrapers began to soar into the heavens . New York had become the mecca for trade from all over the world , the headquarters for shipping , insurance , communications and transportation . It was a city bursting with a unique vitality . Kate loved it , but she sensed David 's unhappiness . " David , this is the future . This place is growing , and we 'll grow with it . " " My God , Kate , how much more do you want ? " And without thinking , she replied , - , ' All there is . " She could not understand why David had even asked the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you won by beating everyone else . It se , emed so obvious to her . Why could n't David see it ? David was a good businessman , but there was something missing in him , a hunger , a compulsion to conquer , to be the biggest and the best . Her father had had that spirit , and she had it . Kate was not sure exactly when it had happened , but at some point in her life , the company had become the master , and she the slave . It owned her more than she owned it . When she tried to explain her feelings to David , he laughed and said , " You 're working too hard . " She 's so much like her father , David thought . And he was not sure why he found that vaguely disturbing . How could one work too hard ? Kate wondered . There was no greater joy in life . It was when she felt most alive . Each day brought a new set of problems , and each problem was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to be won . And she was wonderful at it . She was caught up in something beyond imagination . It had nothing to do with money or achievement ; it had  | to do with power . A power that controlled the lives of thousands of people in every corner of the earth . Just as her life had once been controlled . As long as she had power , she would never truly need anyone . It was a weapon that was awesome beyond belief . Kate was invited to dine with kings and queens and presidents , all seeking her favor , her goodwill . A new Kruger-Brent factory could mean the difference between poverty and riches . Power . The company was alive , a growing giant that had to be fed , and sometimes sacrifices were necessary , for the giant could not be shackled . Kate understood that now . It had a rhythm , a pulse , and it had become her own . In March , a year after they had moved to New York , Kate felt unwell . David persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Harley . He 's a young doctor with a good reputation . " Reluctantly , Kate went to see him . John Harley was a thin , serious-looking young Bostonian about twenty-six , five years younger than Kate . " I warn you , " Kate informed him , " I do n't have time to be sick . " " I 'll bear that in mind , Mrs. Blackwell . Meanwhile , let 's have a look at you . " Dr. Harley examined her , made some tests and said , " I 'm sure it 's nothing serious . I 'll have the results in a day or two . Give me a call on Wednesday . " Early Wednesday morning Kate telephoned Dr. Harley . " I have good news for you , Mrs. Blackwell , " he said cheerfully . " You 're going to have a baby . " It was one of the most exciting moments of Kate 's life . She could not wait to tell David . She had never seen David so thrilled . He scooped her up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a girl , and she 'll look exactly like you . " He was thinking , This is exactly what Kate needs . Now she 'll stay home more . She 'll be more of a wife .  | And Kate was thinking , It will be a boy . One day he 'll take over Kruger-Brent . As the time for the birth of the baby drew nearer , Kate worked shorter hours , but she still went to the office every day . " Forget about the business and relax , " David advised her . What he did not understand was that the business was Kate 's relaxation . The baby was due in December . " I 'll try for the twenty-fifth , " Kate promised David . " He 'll be our Christmas present . " It 's going to be a perfect Christmas , Kate thought . She was head of a great conglomerate , she was married to the man she loved and she was going to have his baby . If there was irony in the order of her priorities , Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and clumsy , and it was getting more and more difficult for Kate to go to the office , but whenever David or Brad Rogers suggested she stay home , her answer was , " My brain is still working . " Two months before the baby was due , David was in South Africa on an inspection tour of the mine at Pniel . He was scheduled to return to New York the following week . Kate was at her desk when Brad Rogers walked in unannounced . She looked at the grim expression on his face and said , " We lost the Shannon deal ! " " No . I ? Kate , I just got word . There 's been an accident . A mine explosion . " She felt a sharp pang . " Where ? Was it bad ? Was anyone killed ? " Brad took a deep breath . " Half a dozen . Kate ? David was with them . " The words seemed to fill the room and reverberate against the paneled walls , growing louder and louder , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that was drowning her , and she felt herself being sucked into its center , deeper and deeper , until she could no longer breathe . And everything became dark and silent .  | The baby was born one hour later , two months premature . Kate named him Anthony James Blackwell , after David 's father . I 'll love you , my son , for me , and I 'll love you for your father . One month later the new Fifth Avenue mansion was ready , and Kate and the baby and a staff of servants moved into it . Two castles in Italy had been stripped to furnish the house . It was a showplace , with elaborately carved sixteenth-century Italian walnut furniture and rose-marble floors bordered with sienna-red marble . The paneled library boasted a magnificent eighteenth-century fireplace over which hung a rare Holbein . There was a trophy room with David 's gun collection , and an art gallery that Kate filled with Rembrandts and Vermeers and Velazquezes and Bellinis . There was a ballroom and a sun room and a formal dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncounted bedrooms . In the large formal gardens were statues by Rodin , Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Maillol . It was a palace fit for a king . And the king is growing up in it , Kate thought happily . In 1928 , when Tony was four , Kate sent him to nursery school . He was a handsome , solemn little boy , with his mother 's gray eyes and stubborn chin . He was given music lessons , and when he was five he attended dancing school . Some of the best times the two of them spent together were at Cedar Hill House in Dark Harbor . Kate bought a yacht , an eighty-foot motor sailer she named the Corsair , and she and Tony cruised the waters along the coast of Maine . Tony adored it . But it was the work that gave Kate her greatest pleasure . There was something mystic about the company Jamie McGregor had founded . It was alive , consuming . It was her lover , and it would never die on a winter day and leave her alone . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one day she would give it to her son . The only disturbing factor in Kate 's life was her homeland . She cared deeply about South Africa . The racial problems there were growing , and Kate was troubled . There were two political  | camps : the verkramptes  --  the narrow ones , the pro-segregationists  --  and the verligtes  --  the enlightened ones , who wanted to improve the position of the blacks . Prime Minister James Hertzog and Jan Smuts had formed a coalition and combined their power to have the New Land Act passed . Blacks were removed from the rolls and were no longer able to vote or own land . Millions of people belonging to different minority groups were disrupted by the new law . The areas that had no minerals , industrial centers or ports were assigned to coloreds , blacks and Indians . Kate arranged a meeting in South Alica with several high government officials . " This is a time bomb , " Kate told them . " What you 're doing is trying to keep eight million people in slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're doing this for their own good . " " Really ? How would you explain ' that ? " " Each race has something to contribute . If the blacks mingle with the whites , they 'll lose their individuality . We 're trying to protect them . " " That 's bloody nonsense , " Kate retorted . " South Africa has become a racist hell . " " That 's not true . Blacks from other countries come thousands of miles in order to enter this country . They pay as much as fifty-six pounds for a forged pass . The black is better off here than anywhere else on earth . " " Then I pity them , " Kate retorted . " They 're primitive children , Mrs. Blackwell . It 's for their own good . " Kate left the meeting frustrated and deeply fearful for her country . Kate was also concerned about Banda . He was in the news a good deal . The South African newspapers were calling him the scarlet pimpernel , and there was a grudging admiration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a laborer , a chauffeur , a janitor . He had organized a guerrilla army and he headed the police 's most-wanted list . One article in the Cape  | Times told of his being carried triumphantly through the streets of a black village on the shoulders of demonstrators . He went from village to village addressing crowds of students , but every time the police got wind of his presence , Banda disappeared . He was said to have a personal bodyguard of hundreds of friends and followers , and he slept at a different house every night . Kate knew that nothing would stop him but death . She had to get in touch with him . She summoned one of her veteran black foremen , a man she trusted . " William , do you think you can find Banda ? " " Only if he wishes to be found . " " Try . I want to meet with him . " " I 'll see what I can do . " The following morning the foreman said , " If you are free this evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country . " Kate was driven to a small village seventy miles north of Johannesburg . The driver stopped in front of a small frame house , and Kate went inside . Banda was waiting for her . He looked exactly the same as when Kate had last seen him . And he must be sixty years old , Kate thought . He had been on the run from the police for years , and yet he appeared serene and calm . He hugged Kate and said , " You look more beautiful every time I see you . " She laughed . " I 'm getting old . I 'm going to be forty in a few years . " " The years sit lightly on you , Kate . " They went into the kitchen , and while Banda fixed coffee , Kate said , " I do n't like what 's happening , Banda . Where is it going to lead ? " " It will get worse , " Banda said simply . " The government will not allow us to speak with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one day they will find they need those bridges to reach us . We have our heroes now , Kate . Nehemiah Tile , Mokone , Richard Msimang . The whites goad us and move us around like cattle to pasture . "  | " Not all whites think like that , " Kate assured him . " You have friends who are fighting to change things . It will happen one day , Banda , but it will take time . " " Time is like sand in an hourglass . It runs out . " " Banda , what 's happened to Ntame and to Magena ? " " My wife and son are in hiding , " Banda said sadly . " The police are still very busy looking for me . " " What can I do to help ? I ca n't just sit by and do nothing . Will money help ? " " Money always helps . " " I will arrange it . What else ? " " Pray . Pray for all of us . " , , The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was old enough to travel , Kate took him on business trips during his school holidays . He was fond of museums , and he could stand for hours looking at the paintings and statues of the great masters . At home , Tony sketched copies of the paintings on the wall , but he was too self-conscious to let his mother see his work . He was sweet and bright and fun to be with , and there was a shyness about him that people found appealing . Kate was proud of her son . He was always first in his class . " You beat all of them , did n't you , darling ? " And she would laugh and hold him fiercely in her arms . And young Tony would try even harder to live up to his mother 's expectations . In 1936 , on Tony 's twelfth birthday , Kate returned from a trip to the Middle East . She had missed Tony and was eager to see him . He was at home waiting for her . She took him in her arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been a good day ? " " Y-yes , m-ma'am . It 's b-b-been wonderful . " Kate pulled back and looked at him . She had never noticed him stutter before . " Are you all right , Tony ? " " F-fine , thank you , M-mother. "  | " You must n't stammer , " she told him . " Speak more slowly . " " Yes , M-mother . " Over the next few weeks , it got worse . Kate decided to talk to Dr. Harley . When he finished the examination , John Harley said , " Physically , there 's nothing wrong with the boy , Kate . Is he under any kind of pressure ? " " My son ? Of course not . How can you ask that ? " " Tony 's a sensitive boy . Stuttering is very often a physical manifestation of frustration , an inability to cope . " " You 're wrong , John . Tony is at the very top of all the achievement tests in school . Last term he won three awards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arts . I 'd hardly call that unable to cope . " " I see . " He studied her . " What do you do when Tony stammers , Kate ? " " I correct him , of course . " " I would suggest that you do n't . That will only make him more tense . " Kate was stung to anger . " If Tony has any psychological problems , as you seem to think , I can assure you it 's not because of his mother . I adore him . And he 's aware that I think he 's the most fantastic child on earth . " And that was the core of the problem . No child could live up to that . Dr. Harley glanced down at his chart . " Let 's see now . Tony is twelve ? " " Yes . " " Perhaps it might be good for him if he went away for a while . Maybe a private school somewhere . " Kate just stared at him . " Let him be on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have some excellent schools in Switzerland . " Switzerland ! The idea of Tony being so far away from her was appalling . He was too young , he was not ready yet , he ? Dr. Harley was watching her . " I 'll think about it , " Kate told him . That afternoon she canceled a board meeting and went home early . Tony was in his room , doing homework . Tony said , " I g-g-got all A 's t-today , M-mother. "  | " What would you think of going to school in Switzerland , darling ? " And his eyes lit up and he said , " M-m-may I ? " Six weeks later , Kate put Tony aboard a ship . He was on his way to the Institute Le Rosey in Rolle , a small town on the shore of Lake Geneva . Kate stood at the New York pier and watched until the huge liner cut loose from the tugboats . Bloody hell ! I 'm going to miss him . Then she turned and walked back to the limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with Brad Rogers . He was forty-six , two years older than Kate . They had become good friends through the years , and she loved him for his devotion to Kruger-Brent . Brad was unmarried and had a variety of attractive girl friends , but gradually Kate became aware that he was half in love with her . More than once he made studiously ambiguous remarks , but she chose to keep their relationship on an impersonal , business level . She broke that pattern only once . Brad had started seeing someone regularly . He stayed out late every night and came into morning meetings tired and distracted , his mind elsewhere . It was bad for the company . When a month went by and his behavior was becoming more flagrant , Kate decided that something had to be done . She remembered how close David had come to quitting the company because of a woman . She would not let that happen with Brad . Kate had planned to travel to Paris alone to acquire an import-export company , but at the last minute she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arrival in meetings and that evening had dinner at the Grand Vefour . Afterward , Kate suggested that Brad join her in her suite at the George V to go over the reports on the new company . When he arrived , Kate was waiting for him in a filmy negligee . " I brought the revised offer with me , " Brad began , " so we ? " " That can wait , " Kate said softly . There was an invitation in her voice that made him look at her again . " I wanted us to be alone , Brad . "  | " Kate ? " She moved into his arms and held him close . " My God ! " he said . " I 've wanted you for so long . " " And I you , Brad . " And they moved into the bedroom . Kate was a sensual woman , but all of her sexual energy had long since been harnessed into other channels . She was completely fulfilled by her work . She needed Brad for other reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs apart and felt his hardness in her , and it was neither pleasant nor unpleasant . " Kate , I 've loved you for so long ... " He was pressing into her , moving in and out in an ancient , timeless rhythm , and she thought , They 're asking too bloody much for the company . They 're going to hold out because they know I really want it . Brad was whispering words of endearment in her ear . I could call off the negotiations and wait for them to come back to me . But what if they do n't ? Do I dare risk losing the deal ? His rhythm was faster now , and Kate moved her hips , thrusting against his body . No . They could easily find another buyer . Better to pay them what they want . I 'll make up for it by selling off one of their subsidiaries . Brad was moaning , in a frenzy of delight , and Kate moved faster , bringing him to a climax . I 'll tell them I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shuddering gasp , and Brad said , " Oh , God , Kate , it was wonderful . Was it good for you , darling ? " " It was heaven . " She lay in Brad 's arms all night , thinking and planning , while he slept . In the morning when he woke up , she said , " Brad , that woman you 've been seeing ? " " My God ! You 're jealous ! " He laughed happily . " Forget about her . I 'll never see her again , I promise . " Kate never went to bed with Brad again . When he could not understand why she refused him , all she said was , " You do n't  | know how much I want to , Brad , but I 'm afraid we would n't be able to work together any longer . We must both make a sacrifice . " And he was forced to live with that . As the company kept expanding , Kate set up charitable foundations that contributed to colleges , churches and schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the great Renaissance and post-Renaissance arty , , ' ts Raphael and Titian , Tintoretto and El Greco ; and the baroque painters Rubens , Caravaggio and Vandyck . The Blackwell collection was reputed to be the most valuable private collection in the world . Reputed , because no one outside of invited guests was permitted to see it . Kate would not allow it to be photographed , nor would she discuss it with the press . She had strict , inflexible rules about the press . The personal life of the Blackwell family was off limits . Neither servants nor employees of the company were permitted to discuss the Blackwell family . It was impossible , of course , to stop rumors and speculation , for Kate Blackwell was an intriguing enigma  --  one of the richest , most powerful women in the world . There were a thousand questions about her , but few answers . Kate telephoned the headmistress at Le Rosey . " I 'm calling to find out how Tony is . " " Ah , he is doing very well , Mrs. Blackwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was n't referring to that . I meant ? " She hesitated , as though reluctant to admit there could be a weakness in the Blackwell family . " I meant his stammering . " " Madame , there is no sign of any stammering . He is perfectly fine . " Kate heaved an inward sigh of relief . She had known all along that it was only temporary , a passing phase of some kind . So much for doctors ! Tony arrived home four weeks later , and Kate was at the airport to meet him . He looked fit and handsome , and Kate  | felt a surge of pride . " Hello , my love . How are you ? " " I 'm f-f-fine , M-m-mother . How are y-y-you ? " On his vacations at home , Tony eagerly looked forward to examining the new paintings his mother had acquired while he was away . He was awed by the masters , and enchanted by the French Impressionists : Monet , Renoir , Manet and Morisot . They evoked a magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an easel and went to work . He thought his paintings were terrible , and he still refused to show them to anyone . How could they compare with the exquisite masterpieces ? Kate told him , " One day all these paintings will belong to you , darling . " The thought of it filled the thirteen-year-old boy with a sense of unease . His mother did not understand . They could never be truly his , because he had done nothing to earn them . He had a fierce determination somehow to earn his own way . He had ambivalent feelings about being away from his mother , for everything around her was always exciting . She was at the center of a whirlwind , giving orders , making incredible deals , taking him to exotic places , introducing him to interesting people . She was an awesome figure , and Tony was inordinately proud of her . He thought she was the most fascinating woman in the world . He felt guilty because it was only in her presence that he stuttered . Kate had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day when he was home on vacation he asked , " M-mmother , do you r-r-run the world ? " And she had laughed and said , " Of course not . What made you ask such a silly question ? " " All my f-friends at school talk about you . Boy , you 're really s-something . " " I am something , " Kate said . " I 'm your mother . " Tony wanted more than anything in the world to please Kate . He knew how much the company meant to her , how much she planned on his running it one day , and he was filled with regret , because he knew he could not . That was not what he intended to do with his life .  | When he tried to explain this to his mother , she would laugh , " Nonsense , Tony . You 're much too young to know what you want to do with your future . " And he would begin to stammer . The idea of being a painter excited Tony . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that was something worthwhile . He wanted to go abroad and study in Paris , but he knew he would have to broach the subject to his mother very carefully . They had wonderful times together . Kate was the chatelaine of vast estates . She had acquired homes in Palm Beach and South Carolina , and a stud farm in Kentucky , and she and Tony visited all of them during his vacations . They watched the America 's Cup races in Newport , and when they were in New York , they had lunch at Delmonico 's and tea at the Plaza and Sunday dinner at Luchow 's . Kate was interested in horse racing , and her stable became one of the finest in the world . When one of Kate 's horses was running and Tony was home from school , Kate would take him to the track with her . They would sit in her box and Tony would watch in wonder as his mother cheered until she was hoarse . He knew her excitement had nothing to do with money . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important . " They had quiet , lazy times at Dark Harbor . They shopped at Pendleton and Coffin , and had ice-cream sodas at the Dark Harbor Shop . In summer they went sailing and hiking and visited art galleries . In the winter there was skiing and skating and sleigh riding . They would sit in front of a fire in the large fireplace in the library , and Kate would tell her son all the old family stories about his grandfather and Banda , and about the baby shower Madam Agnes and her girls gave for Tony 's grandmother . It was a colorful family , a family to be proud of , to cherish . " Kruger-Brent , Limited , will be yours one day , Tony . You 'll run it and ? "  | " I d-do n't want to r-run it , Mother . I 'm not interested in big business or p-power . " And Kate exploded . " You bloody fool ! What do you know about big business or power ? Do you think I go around the world spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of ruthless money machine crushing anything that gets in its way ? Well , let me tell you something , Son . It 's the next best thing to Jesus Christ . We 're the resurrection , Tony . We save lives by the hundreds of thousands . When we open a factory in a depressed community or country , those people can afford to build schools and libraries and churches , and give their children decent food and clothing and recreation facilities . " She was breathing hard , carried away by her anger . " We build factories where people are hungry and out of work , and because of us they 're able to live decent lives and hold up their heads . We become their saviors . Do n't ever again let me hear you sneer at big business and power . " All Tony could say was , " I 'm s-s-sorry , M-m-mother . " And he thought stubbornly : I 'm going to be an artist . When Tony was fifteen , Kate suggested he spend his summer vacation in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get away just now , Tony , but you 'll find it a fascinating place . I 'll make all the arrangements for you . " " I was s-sort of h-hoping to spend my vacation at Dark Harbor , M-mother . " " Next summer , " Kate said firmly . " This summer I would like you to go to Johannesburg . " Kate carefully briefed the company superintendent in Johannesburg , and together they laid out an itinerary for Tony . Each day was planned with one objective in view : to make this trip as exciting as possible for Tony , to make him realize his future lay with the company . Kate received a daily report about her son . He had been taken into one of the gold mines . He had spent two days in the diamond fields . He had been on a guided tour of the Kruger-Brent plants , and had gone on a safari in Kenya . SIDNEY SHELDON 243  | A few days before Tony 's vacation ended , Kate telephoned the company manager in Johannesburg . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's having a great time , Mrs. Blackwell . In fact , this morning he asked if he could n't stay on a little longer . " Kate felt a surge of pleasure . " That 's wonderful ! Thank you . " When Tony 's vacation was over , he went to Southampton , England , where he boarded a Pan American Airways System plane for the United States . Kate flew Pan American whenever possible . It spoiled her for other airlines . Kate left an important meeting to greet her son when he arrived at the Pan American terminal at the newly built La Guardia Airport in New York . His handsome face was filled with enthusiasm . " Did you have a good time , darling ? " " South Africa 's a f-fantastic country , M-mother . Did you know they f-flew me to the Namib Desert where grandfather s-stole those diamonds from Great-grandfather v-van der Merwe ? " " He did n't steal them , Tony , " Kate corrected him . " He merely took what was his . " " Sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no sea mis , but they s-still have the guards and dogs and everything . " He grinned . " They would n't give me any s-samples . " Kate laughed happily . " They do n't have to give you any samples , darling . One day they will all be yours . " " You t-tell them . They would n't 1-listen to me . " She hugged him . " You did enjoy it , did n't you ? " She was enormously pleased that at last Tony was excited about his heritage . " You know what I loved m-most ? " Kate smiled lovingly . " What ? " " The colors . I p-painted a lot of landscapes th-there . I hated to leave . I want to go back there and p-paint . " " Paint ? " Kate tried to sound enthusiastic . " That sounds like a wonderful hobby , Tony . " " No . I do n't m-mean as a hobby , Mother . I want to be a  | p-painter . I 've been thinking a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really think I might have some talent . " Kate felt herself tensing . " You do n't want to spend the rest of your life painting . " " Yes , I do , M-mother . It 's the only thing I really c-care about . " And Kate knew she had lost . He has a right to live his own life , Kate thought . But how can I let him make such a terrible mistake ? In September , the decision was taken out of both their hands . Europe went to war . " I want you to enroll in the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce , " Kate informed Tony . " In two years if you still want to be an artist , you 'll have my blessing . " Kate was certain that by then Tony would change his mind . It was inconceivable that her son would choose to spend his life slapping daubs of color on bits of canvas when he could head the most exciting conglomerate in the world . He was , after all , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another great opportunity . There were worldwide shortages of military supplies and materials , and Kruger-Brent was able to furnish them . One division of the company provided equipment for the armed forces , while another division took care of civilian needs . The company factories were working twenty-four hours a day . Kate was certain the United States was not going to be able to remain neutral . President Franklin D. Roosevelt called upon the country to be the great arsenal of democracy , and on March 11 , 1941 , the Lend-Lease Bill was pushed through Congress . Allied shipping across the Atlantic was menaced by the German blockade . U-boats , the German submarines , attacked and sank scores of Allied ships , fighting in wolf packs of eight . Germany was a juggernaut that seemingly could not be stopped . In defiance of the Versailles Treaty , Adolf Hitler had built up one of the greatest war machines in history . In a new blitzkrieg technique , Germany attacked Poland , Belgium and  | the Netherlands , and in rapid succession , the German machine crushed Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action when she received word that Jews working in the Nazi-confiscated Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , factories were being arrested and deorted to concentration camps . She made two telephone calls , and the following week she was on her way to Switzerland . When she arrived at the Baur au Lac Hotel in Zurich , there was a message that Colonel Brinkmann wished to see her . Brinkmann had been a manager of the Berlin branch of Kruger-Brent , Ltd . When the factory had been taken over by the Nazi government , Brinkmann was given the rank of colonel and kept in charge . He came to see Kate at the hotel . He was a thin , precise man with blond hair combed carefully over his balding skull . " I am delighted to see you , Frau Blackwell . I have a message for you from my government . I am authorized to assure you that as soon as we have won the war , your factories will be returned to you . Germany is going to be the greatest industrial power the world has ever known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What if Germany loses ? " Colonel Brinkmann allowed a small smile to play on his lips . " We both know that can not happen , Frau Blackwell . The United States is wise to stay out of Europe 's business . I hope it continues to do so . " " I 'm sure you do , Colonel . " She leaned forward . " I 've heard rumors about Jews being sent to concentration camps and being exterminated . Is that true ? " " British propaganda , I assure you . It is true that die Juden are sent to work camps , but I give you my word as an officer that they are being treated as they should be . " Kate wondered exactly what those words meant . She intended to find out . The following day Kate made an appointment with a prominent German merchant named Otto Bueller . Bueller was in his  | fifties , a distinguished-looking man with a compassionate face and eyes that had known deep suffering . They met at a small cafe near the bahnhof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been told , " Kate said softly , " that you 've started an underground to help smuggle Jews into neutral countries . Is that true ? " " It 's not true , Mrs. Blackwell . Such an act would be treason against the Third Reich . " " I have also heard that you 're in need of funds to run it . " Herr Bueller shrugged . " Since there is no underground , I have no need of funds to run it , is that not so ? " His eyes kept nervously darting around the cafe . This was a man who breathed and slept with danger each day of his life . " I was hoping I might be of some help , " Kate said carefully . " Kruger-Brent , Limited , has factories in many neutral and Allied countries . If someone could get the refugees there , I would arrange for them to have employment . " Herr Bueller sat there sipping a bitter coffee . Finally , he said , " I know nothing about these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in helping someone in distress , I have an uncle in England who suffers from a terrible , debilitating disease . His doctor bills are very high . " " How high ? " " Fifty thousand dollars a month . Arrangements would have to be made to deposit the money for his medical expenses in London and transfer the deposits to a Swiss bank . " " That can be arranged . " " My uncle would be very pleased . " Some eight weeks later , a small but steady stream of Jewish refugees began to arrive in Allied countries to go to work in Kruger-Brent factories . Tony quit school at the end of two years . He went up to Kate 's office to tell her the news . " I t-tried , M-mother . I really d-did . But I 've m-made up m-my mind . I want to s-study p-painting . When the w-war is over , I 'm g-going to P-paris. "  | Each word was like a hammerblow . " I kn-know you 're d-disappointed , but I have to 1-live my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good . " He saw the look on Kate 's face . " I 've done what you 've asked me to do . Now you 've got to g-give me my chance . They 've accepted me at the Art I-institute in Chicago . " Kate 's mind was in a turmoil . What Tony wanted to do was such a bloody waste . All she could say was , " When do you plan to leave ? " " Enrollment starts on the fifteenth . " " What 's the date today ? " " D-december sixth . " On Sunday , December 7 , 1941 , squadrons of Nakajima bombers and Zero fighter planes from the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor , and the following day , the United States was at war . That afternoon Tony enlisted in the United States Marine Corps . He was sent to Quantico , Virginia , where he was graduated from Officers ' Training School and from there to the South Pacific . Kate felt as though she were living on the edge of an abyss . Her working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but every moment at the back of her mind was the fear that she would receive some dreaded news about Tony ? that he had been wounded or killed . The war with Japan was going badly . Japanese bombers struck at American bases on Guam , Midway and Wake islands . They took Singapore in February 1942 , and quickly overran New Britain , New Ireland and the Admiralty and Solomon islands . General Douglas MacArthur was forced to withdraw from the Philippines . The powerful forces of the Axis were slowly conquering the world , and the shadows were darkening cverywhere . Kate was afraid that Tony might be taken prisoner of war and tortured . With all her power and influence , there was nothing she could do except pray . Every letter from Tony was a beacon of hope , a sign that , a few short weeks before , he had been alive . " They keep us in the dark here , " Tony wrote . " Are  | the Russians still holding on ? The Japanese soldier is brutal , but you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " What 's happening in the States ? Are factory workers really striking for more money ? ... " " The PT boats are doing a wonderful job here . Those boys are all heroes ... " " You have great connections , Mother . Send us a few hundred F4U 's , the new Navy fighters . Miss you .... " On August 7 , 1942 , the Allies began their first offensive action in the Pacific . United States Marines landed on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands , and from then on they kept moving to take back the islands the Japanese had conquered . In Europe , the Allies were enjoying an almost unbroken string of victories . On June 6 , 1944 , the Allied invasion of Western Europe was launched with landings by American , British and Canadian troops on the Normandy beaches , and a year later , on May 7 , 1945 , Germany surrendered unconditionally . In Japan , on August 6 , 1945 , an atomic bomb with a destructive force of more than twenty thousand tons of TNT was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb destroyed the city of Nagasaki . On August 14 , the Japanese surrendered . The long and bloody war was finally over . Three months later , Tony returned home . He and Kate were at Dark Harbor , sitting on the terrace looking over the bay dotted with graceful white sails . The war has changed him , Kate thought . There was a new maturity about Tony . He had grown a small mustache , and looked tanned and fit and handsome . There were lines about his eyes that had not been there before . Kate was sure the years overseas had given him time to reconsider his decision about not going into the company . " What are your plans now , Son ? " Kate asked . Tony smiled . " As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted , Mother  --  I 'm going to P-paris. "  | Tony had been to Paris before , but this time the circumstances were different . The City of Light had been dimmed by the German occupation , but had been saved from destruction when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered a great deal , and though the Nazis had looted the Louvre , Tony found Paris relatively untouched . Besides , this time he was going to live there , to be a part of the city , rather than be a tourist . He could have stayed at Kate 's penthouse on Avenue du Marechal Foch , which had not been damaged during the occupation . Instead , he rented an unfurnished flat in an old converted house behind Grand Montparnasse . The apartment consisted of a living room with a fireplace , a small bedroom and a tiny kitchen that had no refrigerator . Between the bedroom and the kitchen crouched a bathroom with a claw-footed tub and small stained bidet and a temperamental toilet with a broken seat . When the landlady started to make apologies , Tony stopped her . " It 's perfect . " He spent all day Saturday at the flea market . Monday and Tuesday he toured the secondhand shops along the Left Bank ,  | and by Wednesday he had the basic furniture he needed . A sofa bed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornately carved wardrobe , lamps and a rickety kitchen table and two straight chairs . Mother would be horrified , Tony thought . He could have had his apartment crammed with priceless antiques , but that would have been playing the part of a young American artist in Paris . He intended to live it . The next step was getting into a good art school . The most prestigious art school in all of France was the Ecole des BeauxArts of Paris . Its standards were high , and few Americans were admitted . Tony applied for a place there . They 'll never accept me , he thought . But if they do ! Somehow , he had to show his mother he had made the right decision . He submitted three of his paintings and waited four weeks to hear whether he had been accepted . At the end of the fourth week , his concierge handed him a letter from the school . He was to report the following Monday . The Ecole des Beaux-Arts was a large stone building , two stories high , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the school , Maitre Gessand , a towering , bitter-looking man with no neck and the thinnest lips Tony had ever seen . " Your paintings are amateurish , " he told Tony . " But they show promise . Our committee selected you more for what was not in the paintings than for what was in them . Do you under-stand ? " " Not exactly , maitre . " " You will , in time . I am assigning you to Maitre Cantal . He will be your teacher for the next five years  --  if you last that long . " I 'll last that long , Tony promised himself . Maitre Cantal was a very short man , with a totally bald head which he covered with a purple beret . He had dark-brown eyes , a large , bulbous nose and lips like sausages . He greeted Tony with , " Americans are dilettantes , barbarians . Why are you here ? " " To learn , maitre. "  | Maitre Cantal grunted . There were twenty-five pupils in the class , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and Tony selected one near the window that overlooked a workingman 's bistro . Scattered around the room were plaster casts of various parts of the human anatomy taken from Greek statues . Tony looked around for the model . He could see no one . " You will begin , " Maitre Cantal told the class . " Excuse me , " Tony said . " I  --  I did n't bring my paints with me . " " You will not need paints . You will spend the first year learning to draw properly . " The maitre pointed to the Greek statuary . " You will draw those . If it seems too simple for you , let me warn you : Before the year is over , more than half of you will be eliminated . " He warmed to his speech . " You will spend the first year learning anatomy . The second year  --  for those of you who pass the course  --  you will draw from live models , working with oils . The third year  --  and I assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , in my style , greatly improving on it , naturally . In the fourth and fifth years , you will find your own style , your own voice . Now let us get to work . " The class went to work . The maitre went around the room , stopping at each easel to make criticisms or comments . When he came to the drawing Tony was working on , he said curtly , " No ! That will not do . What I see is the outside of an arm . I want to see the inside . Muscles , bones , ligaments . I want to know there is blood flowing underneath . Do you know how to do that ? " " Yes , maitre . You think it , see it , feel it , and then you draw it . " When Tony was not in class , he was usually in his apartment sketching . He could have painted from dawn to dawn . Painting gave him a sense of freedom he had never known before . The simple act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand made him feel godlike . He could create whole worlds with  | one hand . He could make a tree , a flower , a human , a universe . It was a heady experience . He had been born for this . When he was not painting , he was out on the streets of Paris exploring the fabulous city . Now it was his city , the place where his art was being born . There were two Parises , divided by the Seine into the Left Bank and the Right Bank , and they were worlds apart . The Right Bank was for the wealthy , the established . The Left Bank belonged to the students , the artists , the struggling . It was Montparnasse and the Boulevard Raspail and Saint-Germaindes-Press . It was the Cafes Flore and Henry Miller and Elliot Paul . For Tony , it was home . He would sit for hours at the Boule Blanche or La Coupole with fellow students , discussing their arcane world . " I understand the art director of the Guggenheim Museum is in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to wait for me ! " They all read the same magazines and shared them because they were expensive : Studio and Cahiers d'Art , Formes et Couleurs and Gazette des Beaux-Arts . Tony had learned French at Le Rosey , and he found it easy to make friends with the other students in his class , for they all shared a common passion . They had no idea who Tony 's family was , and they accepted him as one of them . Poor and struggling artists gathered at Cafe Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint-Germain , and ate at Le Pot d'Etian on the Rue des Canettes or at the Rue de 1'Universite . None of the others had ever seen the inside of Lasserre or Maxim 's . In 1946 , giants were practicing their art in Paris . From time to time , Tony caught glimpses of Pablo Picasso , and one day Tony and a friend saw Marc Chagall , a large , flamboyant man in his fifties , with a wild mop of hair just beginning to turn gray . Chagall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with a group of people . " We 're lucky to see him , " Tony 's friend whispered . " He comes to Paris very seldom . His home is at Vence , near the Mediterranean coast . " There was Max Ernst sipping an aperitif at a sidewalk cafe ,  | and the great Alberto Giacometti walking down the Rue de Rivoli , looking like one of his own sculptures , tall and thin and gnarled . Tony was surprised to note he was clubfooted . Tony met Hans Belmer , who was making a name for himself with erotic paintings of young girls turning into dismembered dolls . But perhaps Tony 's most exciting moment came when he was introduced to Braque . The artist was cordial , but Tony was tongue-tied . The future geniuses haunted the new art galleries , studying their competition . The Drouant-David Gallery was exhibiting an unknown young artist named Bernard Buffet , who had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts , and Soutine , Utrillo and Dufy . The students congregated at the Salon d'Automne and the Charpentier Gallery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent their spare time gossiping about their successful rivals . The first time Kate saw Tony 's apartment , she was stunned . She wisely made no comment , but she thought , Bloody hell ! How can a son of mine live in this dreary closet ? Aloud she said , " It has great charm , Tony . I do n't see a refrigerator . Where do you keep your food ? " " Out on the w-windowsill . " Kate walked over to the window , opened it and selected an apple from the sill outside . " I 'm not eating one of your subjects , am I ? " Tony laughed . " N-no , Mother . " Kate took a bite . " Now , " she demanded , " tell me about your painting . " " There 's n-not much to t-tell yet , " Tony confessed . " We 're just doing d-drawings this year . " " Do you like this Maitre Cantal ? " " He 's m-marvelous . The important question is whether he I-likes me . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to next year . " Not once did Kate mention Tony 's joining the company . * * *  | Maitre Cantal was not a man to lavish praise . The biggest compliment Tony would get would be a grudging , " I suppose I 've seen worse , " or , " I 'm almost beginning to see underneath . " At the end of the school term , Tony was among the eight advanced to the second-year class . To celebrate , Tony and the other relieved students went to a nightclub in Montmartre , got drunk and spent the night with some young English women who were on a tour of France . When school started again , Tony began to work with oils and live models . It was like being released from kindergarten . After one year of sketching parts of anatomy , Tony felt he knew every muscle , nerve and gland in the human body . That was n't drawing  --  it was copying . Now , with a paintbrush in his hand and a live model in front of him , Tony began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the feel , " he said grudgingly . " Now we must work on the technique . " There were about a dozen models who sat for classes at the school . The ones Maitre Cantal used most frequently were Carlos , a young man working his way through medical school ; Annette , a short , buxom brunette with a clump of red pubic hair and an acne-scarred back ; and Dominique Masson , a beautiful , young , willowy blonde with delicate cheekbones and deep-green eyes . Dominique also posed for several well-known painters . She was everyone 's favorite . Every day after class the male students would gather around her , trying to make a date . " I never mix pleasure with business , " she told them . " Anyway , " she teased , " it would not be fair . You have all seen what I have to offer . How do I know what you have to offer ? " And the ribald conversation would go on . But Dominique never went out with anyone at the school . Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony was finishing a painting of Dominique , she came up behind him unexpectedly . " My nose is too long . " Tony was flustered . " Oh . I 'm sorry , I 'll change it . "  | " No , no . The nose in the painting is fine . It is my nose that is too long . " Tony smiled . " I 'm afraid I ca n't do much about that . " " A Frenchman would have said , Your nose is perfect , cherie . ' " " I like your nose , and I 'm not French . " " Obviously . You have never asked me out . I wonder why . " Tony was taken aback . " I  --  I do n't know . I guess it 's because everyone else has , and you never go out with anybody . " Dominique smiled . " Everybody goes out with somebody . Good night . " And she was gone . Tony noticed that whenever he stayed late , Dominique dressed and then returned to stand behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she announced one afternoon . " You are going to be an important painter . " " Thank you , Dominique . I hope you 're right . " " Painting is very serious to you , oui ? " " Oui . " " Would a man who is going to be an important painter like to buy me dinner ? " She saw the look of surprise on his face . " I do not eat much . I must keep my figure . " Tony laughed . " Certainly . It would be a pleasure . " They ate at a bistro near Sacre-Coeur , and they discussed painters and painting . Tony was fascinated with her stories of the well-known artists for whom she posed . As they were having cafe au lait , Dominique said , " I must tell you , you are as good as any of them . " Tony was inordinately pleased , but all he said was , " I have a long way to go . " Outside the cafe , Dominique asked , " Are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 'd like to . I 'm afraid it is n't much . " When they arrived , Dominique looked around the tiny , messy apartment and shook her head . " You were right . It is not much . Who takes care of you ? "  | " A cleaning lady comes in once a week . " " Fire her . This place is filthy . Do n't you have a girl friend ? " " No . " She studied him a moment . " You 're not queer ? " " No . " " Good . It would be a terrible waste . Find me a pail of water and some soap . " Dominique went to work on the apartment , cleaning and scrubbing and finally tidying up . When she had finished , she said , " That will have to do for now . My God , I need a bath . " She went into the tiny bathroom and ran water in the tub . " How do you fit yourself in this ? " she called out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would like to see that . " Fifteen minutes later , she came out of the bathroom with only a towel around her waist , her blond hair damp and curling . She had a beautiful figure , full breasts , a narrow waist and long , tapering legs . Tony had been unaware of her as a woman before . She had been merely a nude figure to be portrayed on canvas . Oddly enough , the towel changed everything . He felt a sudden rush of blood to his loins . Dominique was watching him . " Would you like to make love to me ? " " Very much . " She slowly removed the towel . " Show me . " Tony had never known a woman like Dominique . She gave him everything and asked for nothing . She came over almost every evening to cook for Tony . When they went out to dinner , Dominique insisted on going to inexpensive bistros or sandwich bars . " You must save your money , " she scolded him . " It is very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are good , cheri . " They went to Les Halles in the small hours of the morning and had onion soup at Pied de Cochon . They went to the Musec Carnavalet and out-of-the-way places where tourists did not go ,  | like Cimetiere Pere-Lachaise  --  the final resting place of Oscar Wilde , Frederic Chopin , Honorer de Balzac and Marcel Proust . They visited the catacombs and spent a lazy holiday week going down the Seine on a barge owned by a friend of Dominique 's . Dominique was a delight to be with . She had a quixotic sense of humor , and whenever Tony was depressed , she would laugh him out of it . She seemed to know everyone in Paris , and she took Tony to interesting parties where he met some of the most prominent figures of the day , like the poet Paul $luard , and Andre Breton , in charge of the prestigious Galerie Maeght . Dominique was a source of constant encouragement . " You are going to be better than all of them , cheri . Believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood to paint at night , Dominique would cheerfully pose for him , even though she had been working all day . God , I 'm lucky , Tony thought . This was the first time he had been sure someone loved him for what he was , not who he was , and it was a feeling he cherished . Tony was afraid to tell Dominique he was the heir to one of the world 's largest fortunes , afraid she would change , afraid they would lose what they had . But for her birthday Tony could not resist buying her a Russian lynx coat . " It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen in my life ! " Dominique swirled the coat around her and danced around the room . She stopped in the middle of a spin . " Where did it come from ? Tony , where did you get the money to buy this coat ? " He was ready for her . " It 's hot  --  stolen . I bought it from a little man outside the Rodin Museum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't cost me much more than a good cloth coat would cost at Au Printemps . " Dominique stared at him a moment , then burst out laughing . " I 'll wear it even if we both go to prison ! " Then she threw her arms around Tony and started to cry . " Oh , Tony , you idiot . You darling , fantastic idiot . " It was well worth the lie , Tony decided . One night Dominique suggested to Tony that he move in with her . Between working at the $cole des Beaux-Arts and modeling  | for some of the better-known artists in Paris , Dominique was able to rent a large , modern apartment on Rue Pretres-Saint Severin . " You should not be living in a place like this , Tony . It is dreadful . Live with me , and you will not have to pay any rent . I can do your laundry , cook for you and ? " " No , Dominique . Thank you . " " But why ? " How could he explain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , but now it was too late . She would feel he had been making a fool of her . So he said , " It would be like living off you . You 've already given me too much . " " Then I 'm giving up my apartment and moving in here . I want to be with you . " She moved in the following day . There was a wonderful , easy intimacy between them . They spent weekends in the country and stopped at little hostels where Tony would set up his easel and paint landscapes , and when they got hungry Dominique would spread out a picnic lunch she had prepared and they would eat in a meadow . Afterward , they made long , sweet love . Tony had never been so completely happy . His work was progressing beautifully . One morning Maitre Cantal held up one of Tony 's paintings and said to the class , " Look at that body . You can see it breathing . " Tony could hardly wait to tell Dominique that night . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the model in my arms every night . " Dominique laughed in excitement and then grew serious . " Tony , I do not think you need three more years of school . You are ready now . Everyone at the school sees that , even Cantal . " Tony 's fear was that he was not good enough , that he was just another painter , that his work would be lost in the flood of pictures turned out by thousands of artists all over the world every day . He could not bear the thought of it . Winning is what 's important , Tony . Remember that . Sometimes when Tony finished a painting he would be filled with a sense of elation and think , I have talent . I really have ' al-  | ent . At other times he would look at his work and think , I 'm a bloody amateur . With Dominique 's encouragement , Tony was gaining more and more confidence in his work . He had finished almost two dozen paintings on his own . Landscapes , still fifes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree , the sun dappling her body . A man 's jacket and shirt were in the foreground , and the viewer knew the woman awaited her lover . When Dominique saw the painting , she cried , " You must have an exhibition ! " " You 're mad , Dominique ! I 'm not ready . " " You 're wrong , mon cher . " Tony arrived home late the next afternoon to find that Dominique was not alone . Anton Goerg , a thin man with an enormous potbelly and protuberant hazel eyes , was with her . He was the owner and proprietor of the Goerg Gallery , a modest gallery on the Rue Dauphine . Tony 's paintings were spread around the room . " What 's going on ? " Tony asked . " What 's going on , monsieur , " Anton Goerg exclaimed , " is that I think your work is brilliant . " He clapped Tony on the back . " I would be honored to give you a showing in my gallery . " Tony looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I do n't know what to say . " " You have already said it , " Goerg replied . " On these canvases . " Tony and Dominique stayed up half the night discussing it . " I do n't feel I 'm ready . The critics will crucify me . " " You 're wrong , cheri . This is perfect for you . It is a small gallery . Only the local people will come and judge you . There is no way you can get hurt . Monsieur Goerg would never offer to give you an exhibition if he did not believe in you . He agrees with me that you are going to be a very important artist . " " All right , " Tony finally said . " Who knows ? I might even sell a painting . " *  | The cable read : ARRIVING PARIS SATURDAY . PLEASE JOIN ME FOR DINNER . LOVE , MOTHER . Tony 's first thought as he watched his mother walk into the studio was , What a handsome woman she is . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands laced through the black . There was a charged vitality about her . Tony had once asked her why she had not remarried . She had answered quietly , " Only two men were ever important in my life . Your father and you . " Now , standing in the little apartment in Paris , facing his mother , Tony said , " It 's g-good to see you , M-mother . " " Tony , you look absolutely wonderful ! The beard is new . " She laughed and ran her fingers through it . " You look like a young Abe Lincoln . " Her eyes swept the small apartment . " Thank God , you 've gotten a good cleaning woman . It looks like a different place . " Kate walked over to the easel , where Tony had been working on a painting , and she stopped and stared at it for a long time . He stood there , nervously awaiting his mother 's reaction . When Kate spoke , her voice was very soft . " It 's brilliant , Tony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pride she felt . She could not be deceived about art , and there was a fierce exultation in her that her son was so talented . She turned to face him . " Let me see more ! " They spent the next two hours going through his stack of paintings . Kate discussed each one in great detail . There was no condescension in her voice . She had failed in her attempt to control his life , and Tony admired her for taking her defeat so gracefully . Kate said , " I 'll arrange for a showing . I know a few dealers who ? " " Thanks , M-mother , but you d-do n't have to . I 'm having a showing next F-friday . A g-gallery is giving me an exhibition . " Kate threw her arms around Tony . " That 's wonderful ! Which gallery ? " " The G-goerg Gallery . "  | " I do n't believe I know it . " " It 's s-small , but I 'm not ready for Hammer or W-wildenstein yet . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're wrong , Tony . I think this ? " There was the sound of the front door opening . " I 'm horny , cheri . Take off your ? " Dominique saw Kate . " Oh , merde ! I 'm sorry . I  --  I did n't know you had company , Tony . " There was a moment of frozen silence . " Dominique , this is my m-mother . M-mother , may I present D-dominique Masson . " The two women stood there , studying each other . " How do you do , Mrs. Blackwell . " Kate said , " I 've been admiring my son 's portrait of you . " The rest was left unspoken . There was another awkward silence . " Did Tony tell you he 's going to have an exhibition , Mrs. Blackwell ? " " Yes , he did . It 's wonderful news . " " Can you s-stay for it , Mother ? " " I 'd give anything to be able to be there , but I have a board meeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can miss it . I wish I 'd known about it sooner , I 'd have rearranged my schedule . " " It 's all r-right , " Tony said . " I understand . " Tony was nervous that his mother might say more about the company in front of Dominique , but Kate 's mind was on the paintings . " It 's important for the right people to see your exhibition . " " Who are the right people , Mrs. Blackwell ? " Kate turned to Dominique . " Opinion-makers , critics . Someone like Andre d'Usseau  --  he should be there . " Andre d'Usseau was the most respected art critic in France . He was a ferocious lion guarding the temple of art , and a single review from him could make or break an artist overnight . D'Usseau was invited to the opening of every exhibition , but he attended only the major ones . Gallery owners and artists trem-  | bled , waiting for his reviews to appear . He was a master of the bon mot , and his quips flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hated man in Parisian art circles , and the most respected . His mordant wit and savage criticism were tolerated because of his expertise . Tony turned to Dominique . " That 's a m-mother for you . " Then to Kate , " Andre d'Usseau does n't g-go to little galleries . " " Oh , Tony , he must come . He can make you famous overnight . " " Or b-break me . " " Do n't you believe in yourself ? " Kate was watching her son . " Of course he does , " Dominique said . " But we could n't dare hope that Monsieur d'Usseau would come . " " I could probably find some friends who know him . " Dominique 's face lighted up . " That would be fantastic ! " She turned to Tony . " Cheri , do you know what it would mean if he came to your opening ? " " Oblivion ? " " Be serious . I know his taste , Tony . I know what he likes . He will adore your paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange for him to come unless you want me to , Tony . " " Of course he wants it , Mrs. Blackwell . " Tony took a deep breath . " I 'm s-scared , but what the hell ! L-let 's try . " " I 'll see what I can do . " Kate looked at the painting on the easel for a long , long time , then turned back to Tony . There was a sadness in her eyes . " Son , I must leave Paris tomorrow . Can we have dinner tonight ? " Tony replied , " Yes , of course , Mother . We 're f-free . " Kate turned to Dominique and said graciously , " Would you like to have dinner at Maxim 's or ? " Tony said quickly , " Dominique and I know a w-wonderfu I little cafe not f-far from here . " They went to a bistro at the Place Victoire . The food was good and the wine was excellent . The two women seemed to get along well , and Tony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the  | best nights of my life , he thought . I 'm with my mother and the woman I 'm going to marry . The next morning Kate telephoned from the airport . " I 've made a half a dozen phone calls , " she told Tony . " No one could give me a definite answer about Andre d'Usseau . But whichever way it goes , darling , I 'm proud of you . The paintings are wonderful . Tony , I love you . " " I 1-love you , too , M-mother . " The Goerg Gallery was just large enough to escape being called intime . Two dozen of Tony 's paintings were being hung on the walls in frantic , last-minute preparation for the opening . On a marble sideboard were slabs of cheese and biscuits and bottles of Chablis . The gallery was empty except for Anton Goerg , Tony , Dominique and a young female assistant who was hanging the last of the paintings . Anton Goerg looked at his watch . " The invitations said seven o'clock . ' People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony had not expected to be nervous . And I 'm not nervous , he told himself . I 'm panicky ! " What if no one shows up ? " he asked . " I mean , what if not one single , bloody person shows up ? " Dominique smiled and stroked his cheek . " Then we 'll have all this cheese and wine for ourselves . " People began to arrive . Slowly at first , and then in larger numbers . Monsieur Goerg was at the door , effusively greeting them . They do n't look like art buyers to me , Tony thought grimly . His discerning eye divided them into three categories : There were the artists and art students who attended each exhibition to evaluate the competition ; the art dealers who came to every exhibition so they could spread derogatory news about aspiring painters ; and the arty crowd , consisting to a large extent of homosexuals and lesbians who seemed to spend their lives around the fringes of the art world . I 'm not going to sell a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tony from across the room .  | " I do n't think I want to meet any of these people , " Tony whispered to Dominique . " They 're here to rip me apart . " " Nonsense . They came here to meet you . Now be charming , Tony . " And so , he was charming . He met everybody , smiled a lot and uttered all the appropriate phrases in response to the compliments that were paid him . But were they really compliments ? Tony wondered . Over the years a vocabulary had developed in art circles to cover exhibitions of unknown painters . Phrases that said everything and nothing . " You really feel you 're there ... " " I 've never seen a style quite like yours ... " " Now , that 's a painting ! ... " " It speaks to me ... " " You could n't have done it any better ... " People kept arriving , and Tony wondered whether the attraction was curiosity about his paintings or the free wine and cheese . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine and cheese were being consumed rapaciously . " Be patient , " Monsieur Goerg whispered to Tony . " They are interested . First they must get a smell of the paintings . They see one they like , they keep wandering back to it . Pretty soon they ask the price , and when they nibble , voila ! The hook is set ! " " Jesus ! I feel like I 'm on a fishing cruise , " Tony told Dominique . Monsieur Goerg bustled up to Tony . " We 've sold one ! " he exclaimed . " The Normandy landscape . Five hundred francs . " It was a moment that Tony would remember as long as he lived . Someone had bought a painting of his ! Someone had thought enough of his work to pay money for it , to hang it in his home or office , to look at it , live with it , show it to friends . It was a small piece of immortality . It was a way of living more than one life , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A successful artist was in hundreds of homes and offices and museums all over the world , bringing pleasure to thousands  --  sometimes millions of people . Tony felt as though he had stepped into the pantheon of Da Vinci and Michelangelo and Rem-  | brandt . He was no longer an amateur painter , he was a professional . Someone had paid money for his work . Dominique hurried up to him , her eyes bright with excitement . " You 've just sold another one , Tony . " " Which one ? " he asked eagerly . " The floral . " The small gallery was filled now with people and loud chatter and the clink of glasses ; and suddenly a stillness came over the room . There was an undercurrent of whispers and all eyes turned to the door . Andre d'Usseau was entering the gallery . He was in his middle fifties , taller than the average Frenchman , with a strong , leonine face and a mane of white hair . He wore a flowing inverness cape and Borsalino hat , and behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room began to make way for d'Usseau . There was not one person present who did not know who he was . Dominique squeezed Tony 's hand . " He 's come ! " she said . " He 's here ! " Such an honor had never befallen Monsieur Goerg before , and he was beside himself , bowing and scraping before the great man , doing everything but tugging at his forelock . " Monsieur d'Usseau , " he babbled . " What a great pleasure this is ! What an honor ! May I offer you some wine , some cheese ? " He cursed himself for not having bought a decent wine . " Thank you , " the great man replied . " I have come to feast only my eyes . I would like to meet the artist . " Tony was too stunned to move . Dominique pushed him forward . " Here he is , " Monsieur Goerg said . " Mr. Andre d'Usseau , this is Tony Blackwell . " Tony found his voice . " How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Andre d'Usseau bowed slightly and moved toward the paintings on the walls . Everyone pushed back to give him room . He made his way slowly , looking at each painting long and carefully , then moving on to the next one . Tony tried to read his  | face , but he could tell nothing . D'Usseau neither frowned nor smiled . He stopped for a long time at one particular painting , a nude of Dominique , then moved on . He made a complete circle of the room , missing nothing . Tony was perspiring profusely . When Andre d'Usseau had finished , he walked over to Tony . " I am glad I came , " was all he said . Within minutes after the famous critic had left , every painting in the gallery was sold . A great new artist was being born , and everyone wanted to be in at the birth . " I have never seen anything like it , " Monsieur Goerg exclaimed . " Andre d'Usseau came to my gallery . My gallery ! All Paris will read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andre d'Usseau is not a man to waste words . This calls for champagne . Let us celebrate . " Later that night , Tony and Dominique had their own private celebration . Dominique snuggled in his arms . " I 've slept with painters before , " she said , " but never anyone as famous as you 're going to be . Tomorrow everyone in Paris will know who you are . " And Dominique was right . At five o'clock the following morning , Tony and Dominique hurriedly got dressed and went out to get the first edition of the morning paper . It had just arrived at the kiosk . Tony snatched up the paper and turned to the art section . His review was the headline article under the by-line of Andre d'Usseau . Tony read it aloud : " An exhibition by a young American painter , Anthony Blackwell , opened last night at the Goerg Gallery . It was a great learning experience for this critic . I have attended so many exhibitions of talented painters that I had forgotten what truly bad paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony 's face turned ashen . " Please do n't read any more , " Dominique begged . She tried to take the paper from Tony .  | " Let go ! " he commanded . He read on . " At first I thought a joke was being perpetrated . I could not seriously believe that anyone would have the nerve to hang such amateurish paintings and dare to call them art . I searched for the tiniest glimmering of talent . Alas , there was none . They should have hung the painter instead of his paintings . I would earnestly advise that the confused Mr. Blackwell return to his real profession , which I can only assume is that of house painter . " " I ca n't believe it , " Dominique whispered . " I ca n't believe he could n't see it . Oh , that bastard ! " Dominique began to cry helplessly . Tony felt as though his chest were filled with lead . He had difficulty breathing . " He saw it , " he said . " And he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was filled with pain . " That 's what hurts so much . Christ ! What a fool I was ! " He started to move away . " Where are you going , Tony ? " " I do n't know . " He wandered around the cold , dawn streets , unaware of the tears running down his face . Within a few hours , everyone in Paris would have read that review . He would be an object of ridicule . But what hurt more was that he had deluded himself . He had really believed he had a career ahead of him as a painter . At least Andre d'Usseau had saved him from that mistake . Pieces of posterity , Tony thought grimly . Pieces of shit ! He walked into the first open bar and proceeded to get mindlessly drunk . When Tony finally returned to his apartment , it was five o'clock the following morning . Dominique was waiting for him , frantic . " Where have you been , Tony ? Your mother has been trying to get in touch with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read it to her ? " " Yes , she insisted . I ? "  | The telephone rang . Dominique looked at Tony , and picked up the receiver . " Hello ? Yes , Mrs. Blackwell . He just walked in . " She held the receiver out to Tony . He hesitated , then took it . " Hello , M-mother . " Kate 's voice was filled with distress . " Tony , darling , listen to me . I can make him print a retraction . I ? " " Mother , " Tony said wearily , " this is n't a b-business transaction . This is a c-critic expressing an opinion . His opinion is that I should be h-hanged . " " Darling , I hate to have you hurt like this . I do n't think I can stand ? " She broke off , unable to continue . " It 's all right , M-mother . I 've had my little f-fling . I tried it and it did n't w-work . I do n't have what it t-takes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts , but he 's the best g-goddamned art critic in the world , I have to g-give him that . He saved me from making a t-terrible mistake . " " Tony , I wish there was something I could say ... " " D'Usseau s-said it all . It 's b-better that I f-found it out now instead of t-ten years from now , is n't it ? I 've got to g-get out of this town . " " Wait there for me , darling . I 'll leave Johannesburg tomorrow and we 'll go back to New York together . " " All right , " Tony said . He replaced the receiver and turned toward Dominique . " I 'm sorry , Dominique . You picked the wrong fellow . " Dominique said nothing . She just looked at him with eyes filled with an unspeakable sorrow . The following afternoon at Kruger-Brent 's office on Rue Matignon , Kate Blackwell was writing out a check . The man seated across the desk from her sighed . " It is a pity . Your son has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important painter . " Kate stared at him coldly . " Mr. d'Usseau , there are tens of thousands of painters in the world . My son was not meant to be one of the crowd . " She passed the check across the desk . " You fulfilled your part of the bargain , I 'm prepared to fulfill mine .  | Kruger-Brent , Limited , will sponsor art museums in Johannesburg , London and New York . You will be in charge of selecting the paintings  --  with a handsome commission , of course . " But long after d'Usseau had gone , Kate sat at her desk , filled with a deep sadness . She loved her son so much . If he ever found out . . . She knew the risk she had taken . But she could not stand by and let Tony throw away his inheritance . No matter what it might cost her , he had to be protected . The company had to be protected . Kate rose , feeling suddenly very tired . It was time to pick up Tony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , so he could get on with what he had been born to do . Run the company .  | For the next two years , Tony Blackwell felt he was on a giant treadmill that was taking him nowhere . He was the heir apparent to an awesome conglomerate . Kruger-Brent 's empire had expanded to include paper mills , an airline , banks and a chain of hospitals . Tony learned that a name is a key that opens all doors . There are clubs and organizations and social cliques where the coin of the realm is not money or influence , but the proper name . Tony was accepted for membership in the Union Club , The Brook and The Links Club . He was catered to everywhere he went , but he felt like an imposter . He had done nothing to deserve any of it . He was in the giant shadow of his grandfather , and he felt he was constantly being measured against him . It was unfair , for there were no more mine fields to crawl over , no guards shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales of derring-do had nothing to do with Tony . They belonged to a past century , another time , another place , heroic acts committed by a stranger . Tony worked twice as hard as anyone else at Kruger-Brent , Ltd . He drove himself mercilessly , trying to rid himself of memories too searing to bear . He wrote to Dominique , but his letters  | were returned unopened . He telephoned Maitre Cantal , but Dominique no longer modeled at the school . She had disappeared . Tony handled his job expertly and methodically , with neither passion nor love , and if he felt a deep emptiness inside himself , no one suspected it . Not even Kate . She received weekly reports on Tony , and she was pleased with them . " He has a natural aptitude for business , " she told Brad Rogers . To Kate , the long hours her son worked were proof of how much he loved what he was doing . When Kate thought of how Tony had almost thrown his future away , she shuddered and was grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in full power in South Africa , with segregation in all public places . Migration was strictly controlled , and families were split up to suit the convenience of the government . Every black man had to carry a bewyshoek , and it was more than a pass , it was a lifeline , his birth certificate , his work permit , his tax receipt . It regulated his movements and his life . There were increasing riots in South Africa , and they were ruthlessly put down by the police . From time to time , Kate read newspaper stories about sabotage and unrest , and Banda 's name was always prominently mentioned . He was still a leader in the underground , despite his age . Of course he would fight for his people , Kate thought . He 's Banda . Kate celebrated her fifty-sixth birthday alone with Tony at the house on Fifth Avenue . She thought , This handsome twentyfour-year-old man across the table ca n't be my son . I 'm too young . And he was toasting her , " To m-my f-fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to my fantastic old mother . " Soon I 'll be retiring , Kate thought , but my son will take my place . My son ! At Kate 's insistence , Tony had moved into the mansion on Fifth Avenue . " The place is too bloody large for me to rattle around in alone , " Kate told him . " You 'll have the whole east wing to  | yourself and all the privacy you need . " It was easier for Tony to give in than to argue . Tony and Kate had breakfast together every morning , and the topic of conversation was always Kruger-Brent , Ltd . Tony marveled that his mother could care so passionately for a faceless , soulless entity , an amorphous collection of buildings and machines and bookkeeping figures . Where did the magic lie ? With all the myriad mysteries of the world to explore , why would anyone want to waste a lifetime accumulating wealth to pile on more wealth , gathering power that was beyond power ? Tony did not understand his mother . But he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she expected of him . The Pan American flight from Rome to New York had been uneventful . Tony liked the airline . It was pleasant and efficient . He worked on his overseas acquisitions reports from the time the plane took off , skipping dinner and ignoring the stewardesses who kept offering him drinks , pillows or whatever else might appeal to their attractive passenger . " Thank you , miss . I 'm fine . " " If there 's anything at all , Mr. Blackwell ... " " Thank you . " A middle-aged woman in the seat next to Tony was reading a fashion magazine . As she turned a page , Tony happened to glance over , and he froze . There was a picture of a model wearing a ball gown . It was Dominique . There was no question about it . There were the high , delicate cheekbones and the deep-green eyes , the luxuriant blond hair . Tony 's pulse began to race . " Excuse me , " Tony said to his seat companion . " May I borrow that page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress shop and got the name of their advertising agency . He telephoned them . " I 'm trying to locate one of your models , " he told the switchboard operator . " Could you ? " " One moment , please . " A man 's voice came on . " May I help you ? "  | " I saw a photograph in this month 's issue of Vogue . A model advertising a ball gown for the Rothman stores . Is that your ac-count ? " " Yes . " " Can you give me the name of your model agency ? " " That would be the Carleton Blessing Agency . " He gave Tony the telephone number . A minute later , Tony was talking to a woman at the Blessing Agency . " I 'm trying to locate one of your models , " he said . " Dominique Masson . " " I 'm sorry . It is our policy not to give out personal information . " And the line went dead . Tony sat there , staring at the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dominique . He went into Brad Rogers 's office . " Morning , Tony . Coffee ? " " No , thanks . Brad , have you heard of the Carleton Blessing Model Agency ? " " I should think so . We own it . " " What ? " " It 's under the umbrella of one of our subsidiaries . " ' When did we acquire it ? " " A couple of years ago . Just about the time you joined the company . What 's your interest in it ? " " I 'm trying to locate one of their models . She's. an old friend . " " No problem . I 'll call and ? " " Never mind . I 'll do it . Thanks , Brad . " A feeling of warm anticipation was building up inside Tony . Late that afternoon , Tony went uptown to the offices of the Carleton Blessing Agency and gave his name . Sixty seconds later , he was seated in the office of the president , a Mr. Tilton . " This is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problem . Our profits for the last quarter ? " " No problem . I 'm interested in one of your models . Dominique Masson. "  | Tilton 's face lighted up . " She 's turned out to be one of our very best . Your mother has a good eye . " Tony thought he had misunderstood him . " I beg your par-don ? " " Your mother personally requested that we engage Dominique . It was part of our deal when Kruger-Brent , Limited , took us over . It 's all in our file , if you 'd care to ? " " No . " Tony could make no sense of what he was hearing . Why would his mother ? ? " May I have Dominique 's address , please ? " " Certainly , Mr. Blackwell . She 's doing a layout in Vermont today , but she should be back " ? he glanced at a schedule on his desk ? " tomorrow afternoon . " Tony was waiting outside Dominique 's apartment building when a black sedan pulled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic-looking man carrying Dominique 's suitcase . Dominique stopped dead when she saw Tony . " Tony ! My God ! What  --  what are you doing here ? " " I need to talk to you . " " Some other time , buddy , " the athlete said . " We have a busy afternoon . " Tony did not even look at him . " Tell your friend to go away . " " Hey ! Who the hell do you think ? ? " Dominique turned to the man . " Please go , Ben . I 'll call you this evening . " He hesitated a moment , then shrugged . " Okay . " He glared at Tony , got back in the car and roared off . Dominique turned to Tony . " You 'd better come inside . " The apartment was a large duplex with white rugs and drapes and modern furniture . It must have cost a fortune . " You 're doing well , " Tony said . " Yes . I 've been lucky . " Dominique 's fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a drink ? " " No , thanks . I tried to get in touch with you after I left Paris . " " I moved . "  | " To America ? " " Yes . " " How did you get a job with the Carleton Blessing Agency ? " " I  --  I answered a newspaper advertisement , " she said lamely . " When did you first meet my mother , Dominique ? " " I  --  at your apartment in Paris . Remember ? We ? " " No more games , " Tony said . He felt a wild rage building in him . " It 's over . I 've never hit a woman in my life , but if you tell me one more lie , I promise you your face wo n't be fit to photograph . " Dominique started to speak , but the fury in Tony 's eyes stopped her . " I 'll ask you once more . When did you first meet my mother ? " This time there was no hesitation . " When you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to model there . " He felt sick to his stomach . He forced himself to go on . " So I could meet you ? " " Yes , I ? " " And she paid you to become my mistress , to pretend to love me ? " " Yes . It was just after the war  --  it was terrible . I had no money . Do n't you see ? But Tony , believe me , I cared . I really cared ? " " Just answer my questions . " The savagery in his voice frightened her . This was a stranger before her , a man capable of untold violence . " What was the point of it ? " " Your mother wanted me to keep an eye on you . " He thought of Dominique 's tenderness and her lovemaking ? bought and paid for , courtesy of his mother  --  and he was sick with shame . All along , he had been his mother 's puppet , controlled , manipulated . His mother had never given a damn about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown prince , her heir apparent . All that mattered to her was the company . He took one  | last look at Dominique , then turned and stumbled out . She looked after him , her eyes blinded by tears , and she thought , I did n't lie about loving you , Tony . I did n't lie about that . Kate was in the library when Tony walked in , very drunk . " I t-talked to D-dominique , " he said . " You t-two m-must have had a w-wonderful time 1-laughing at me behind my back . " Kate felt a quick sense of alarm . " Tony ? " " From now on I want you to s-stay out of my p-personal 1-life . Do you hear me ? " And he turned and staggered out of the room . Kate watched him go , and she was suddenly filled with a terrible sense of foreboding .  | The following day , Tony took an apartment in Greenwich Village . There were no more sociable dinners with his mother . He kept his relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time Kate made conciliatory overtures , which Tony ignored . Kate 's heart ached . But she had done what was right for Tony . Just as she had once done what was right for David . She could not have let either of them leave the company . Tony was the one human being in the world Kate loved , and she watched as he became more and more insular , drawing deep within himself , rejecting everyone . He had no friends . Where once he had been warm and outgoing , he was now cool and reserved . He had built a wall around himself that no one was able to breach . He needs a wife to care for him , Kate thought . And a son to carry on . / must help him . I must . Brad Rogers came into Kate 's office and said , " I 'm afraid we 're in for some more trouble , Kate . " " What 's happened ? "  | He put a cable on her desk . " The South African Parliament has outlawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kate said , " My God ! " The act had nothing to do with communism . It stated that anyone who disagreed with any government policy and tried to change it in any way was guilty under the Communist Act and could be imprisoned . " It 's their way of breaking the black resistance movement , " she said . " If ? " She was interrupted by her secretary . " There 's an overseas call for you . It 's Mr. Pierce in Johannesburg . " Jonathan Pierce was the manager of the Johannesburg branch office . Kate picked up the phone . " Hello , Johnny . How are you ? " " Fine , Kate . I have some news I thought you 'd better be aware of . " " What 's that ? " " I 've just received a report that the police have captured Banda . " Kate was on the next flight to Johannesburg . She had alerted the company lawyers to see what could be done for Banda . Even the power and prestige of Kruger-Brent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been designated an enemy of the state , and she dreaded to think what his punishment would be . At least she must see him and talk to him and offer what support she could . When the plane landed in Johannesburg , Kate went to her office and telephoned the director of prisons . " He 's in an isolation block , Mrs. Blackwell , and he 's allowed no visitors . However , in your case , I will see what can be done ... " The following morning , Kate was at the Johannesburg prison , face to face with Banda . He was manacled and shackled , and there was a glass partition between them . His hair was completely white . Kate had not known what to expect  --  despair , defiance  --  but Banda grinned when he saw her and said , " I knew  | you 'd come . You 're just like your daddy . You ca n't stay away from trouble , can you ? " " Look who 's talking , " Kate retorted . " Bloody hell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a box . That 's the only way they 're going to let me go . " " I have a lot of fancy lawyers who ? " " Forget it , Kate . They caught me fair and square . Now I 've got to get away fair and square . " " What are you talking about ? " " I do n't like cages , I never did . And they have n't built one yet that can keep me . " Kate said , " Banda , do n't try it . Please . They 'll kill you . " " Nothing can kill me , " Banda said . " You 're talking to a man who lived through sharks and land mines and guard dogs . " A soft gleam cattle into his eyes . " You know something , Kate ? I think maybe that was the best time of my life . " When Kate went to visit Banda the next day , the superintendent said , " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Blackwell . We 've had to move him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not at liberty to say . " When Kate woke up the following morning , she saw the headline in the newspaper carried in with her breakfast tray . It read : REBEL LEADER KILLED WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE PRISON . She was at the prison an hour later , in the superintendent 's office . " He was shot during an attempted prison break , Mrs. Blackwell . That 's all there is to it . " You 're wrong , thought Kate , there 's more . Much more . Banda was dead , but was his dream of freedom for his people dead ? Two days later , after making the funeral arrangements , Kate was on the plane to New York . She looked out the window to take one last look at her beloved land . The soil was red and rich and fertile , and in the bowels of its earth were treasures beyond man 's dreams . This was God 's chosen land , and He had been  | lavish in his generosity . But there was a curse upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kate thought sadly . Never . One of Brad Rogers 's responsibilities was to oversee the Long-Range Planning Department of Kruger-Brent , Ltd . He was brilliant at finding businesses that would make profitable acquisitions . One day in early May , he walked into Kate Blackwell 's office . " I 've come across something interesting , Kate . " He placed two folders on her desk . " Two companies . If we could pick up either one of them , it would be a coup . " " Thanks , Brad . I 'll look them over tonight . " That evening , Kate dined alone and studied Brad Rogers 's confidential reports on the two companies  --  Wyatt Oil &; Tool and International Technology . The reports were long and detailed , and both ended with the letters ms , the company code for Not Interested in Selling , which meant that if the companies were to be acquired , it would take more than a straightforward business transaction to accomplish it . And , Kate thought , they 're well worth taking over . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which eliminated any possibility of a takeover attempt . It was a challenge , and it had been a long time since Kate had faced a challenge . The more she thought about it , the more the possibilities began to excite her . She studied again the confidential balance sheets . Wyatt Oil &; Tool was owned by a Texan , Charlie Wyatt , and the company 's assets included producing oil wells , a utility company and dozens of potentially profitable oil leases . There was no question about it , Wyatt Oil &; Tool would make a handsome acquisition for Kruger-Brent , Ltd . Kate turned her attention to the second company . International Technology was owned by a German , Count Frederick Hoffman . The company had started with a small steel mill in Essen , and over the years had expanded into a huge conglomerate , with shipyards , petrochemical plants , a fleet of oil tankers and a computer division .  | As large as Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , was , it could digest only one of these giants . She knew which company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll see about that , Kate thought . Early the following morning , she sent for Brad Rogers . " I 'd love to know how you got hold of those confidential balance sheets , " Kate grinned . " Tell me about Charlie Wyatt and Frederick Hoffman . " Brad had done his homework . " Charlie Wyatt was born in Dallas . Flamboyant , loud , runs his own empire , smart as hell . He started with nothing , got lucky in oil wildcatting , kept expanding aid now he owes about half of Texas . " " How old is he ? " " Forty-seven . " " Children ? " " One daughter , twenty-five . From what I hear , she 's a raving beauty . " " Is she married ? " " Divorced . " " Frederick Hoffman . " " Hoffman 's a couple of years younger than Charlie Wyatt . He 's a count , comes from a distinguished German family going back to the Middle Ages . He 's a widower . His grandfather started with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built it into a conglomerate . He was one of the first to get into the computer field . He holds a lot of patents on microprocessors . Every time we use a computer , Count Hoffman gets a royalty . " " Children ? " " A daughter , twenty-three . " " What is she like ? " " I could n't find out , " Brad Rogers apologized . " It 's a very buttoned-up family . They travel in their own little circles . " He hesitated . " We 're probably wasting our time on this , Kate . I had a few drinks with a couple of top executives in both companies .  | Neither Wyatt nor Hoffman has the slightest interest in a sale , merger or joint venture . As you can see from their financials , they 'd be crazy even to think about it . " That feeling of challenge was there in Kate again , tugging at her . Ten days later Kate was invited by the President of the United States to a Washington conference of leading international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone call , and shortly afterward Charlie Wyatt and Count Frederick Hoffman received invitations to attend the conference . Kate had formed a mental impression of both the Texan and the German , and they fitted her preconceived notions almost precisely . She had never met a shy Texan , and Charlie Wyatt was no exception . He was a huge man  --  almost six feet four inches  --  with enormous shoulders and a football player 's body that had gone to fat . His face was large and ruddy , and his voice loud and booming . He came off as a good of boy  --  or would have if Kate had not known better . Charlie Wyatt had not built his empire by luck . He was a business genius . Kate had talked to him for less than ten minutes when she knew that there was no way this man could be persuaded to do anything he did not want to do . He was opinionated , and he had a deep stubborn streak . No one was going to cajole him , threaten him or con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Achilles ' heel , and that was enough . Frederick Hoffman was Charlie Wyatt 's opposite . He was a handsome man , with an aristocratic face and soft brown hair tinged with gray at the temples . He was punctiliously correct and filled with a sense of old-fashioned courtesy . On the surface , Frederick Hoffman was pleasant and debonair ; on the inside Kate sensed a core of steel . The conference in Washington lasted three days , and it went well . The meetings were chaired by the Vice-President , and the President made a brief appearance . Everyone there was im-  | pressed with Kate Blackwell . She was an attractive , charismatic woman , head of a corporate empire she had helped build , and they were fascinated , as Kate meant them to be . When Kate got Charlie Wyatt alone for a moment , she asked innocently , " Is your family with you , Mr. Wyatt ? " " I brought my daughter along . She has a little shoppin ' to do . " " Oh , really ? How nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knew his daughter was with him , but what kind of dress she had boughs at Garfinckes that morning . " I 'm giving a little dinner party at Dark Harbor Friday . I 'd be pleased if you and your daughter would join us for the weekend . " Wyatt did not hesitate . " I 've heard a lot about your spread , Mrs. Blackwell . I 'd sure like to see it . " Kate smiled . " Good . I 'll make arrangements for you to be flown up there tomorrow night . " Ten minutes later , Kate was speaking to Frederick Hoffman . " Are you alone in Washington , Mr. Hoffman ? " she asked . " Or is your wife with you ? " " My wife died a few years ago , " Frederick Hoffman told her . " I 'm here with my daughter . " Kate knew they were staying at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Suite 418 . " I 'm giving a little dinner party at Dark Harbor . I would be delighted if you and your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be getting back to Germany , " Hoffman replied . He studied her a moment , and smiled . " I suppose another day or two wo n't make much difference . " " Wonderful . I 'll arrange transportation for you . " It was Kate 's custom to give a party at the Dark Harbor estate once every two months . Some of the most interesting and powerful people in the world came to these gatherings , and the gettogethers were always fruitful . Kate intended to see to it that this one was a very special party . Her problem was to make sure Tony attended . During the past year , he had seldom bothered to show up , and when he did he had made a perfunctory appear-  | ance and left . This time it was imperative that he come and that he stay . When Kate mentioned the weekend to Tony , he said curtly , " I c-ca n't make it . I 'm leaving for C-canada Monday and I have a lot of w-work to clean up before I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Charlie Wyatt and Count Hoffman are going to be there and they 're ? " " I know who they are , " he interrupted . " I t-talked to Brad Rogers . We have n't got a p-prayer of acquiring either one of those companies . " " I want to give it a try . " He looked at her and asked , " W-which one are you after ? " " Wyatt Oil and Tool . It could increase our profits as much as fifteen percent , perhaps more . When the Arab countries realize they have the world by the throat , they 're going to form a cartel , and oil prices will skyrocket . Oil is going to turn into liquid gold . " " What about International T-t-technology ? " Kate shrugged . " It 's a good company , but the plum is Wyatt Oil and Tool . It 's a perfect acquisition for us . I need you there , Tony . Canada can wait a few days . " Tony loathed parties . He hated the endless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this was business . " All right . " All the pieces were in place . The Wyatts were flown to Maine in a company Cessna , and from the ferry were driven to Cedar Hill House in a limousine . Kate was at the door to greet them . Brad Rogers had been right about Charlie Wyatt 's daughter , Lucy . She was strikingly beautiful . She was tall , with black hair and gold-flecked brown eyes , set in almost perfect features . Her sleek Galanos dress outlined a firm , stunning figure . She had , Brad informed Kate , been divorced from a wealthy Italian playboy two years earlier . Katc introduced Lucy to Tony and watched for her son 's reaction . There was none . He greeted both the Wyatts with equal cour-  | tesy and led them into the bar , where a bartender was waiting to mix drinks . " What a lovely room , " Lucy exclaimed . Her voice was unexpectedly soft and mellow , with no trace of a Texas accent . " Do you spend much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She waited for him to go on . Then , " Did you grow up here ? " " Partly. ; ir Kate picked up the conversatiop , adroitly smoothing over Tony 's silence . " Some of Tony 's happiest memories are of this house . The poor man is so busy he does n't get much chance to come back here and enjoy it , do you , Tony ? " He gave his mother a cool look and said , " No . As a matter of fact , I should be in C-canada ? " " But he postponed it so he could meet both of you , " Kate finished for him . " Well , I 'm mighty pleased , " Charlie Wyatt said . " I 've heard a lot about you , son . " He grinned . " You would n't want to come to work for me , would you ? " " I do n't think that 's q-quite what my mother had in mind , Mr. Wyatt . " Charlie Wyatt grinned again . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your mother 's quite a lady . You should have seen her rope and hog-tie everybody at that White House meetin ' . She ? " He stopped as Frederick Hoffman and his daughter , Marianne , entered the room . Marianne Hoffman was a pale version of her father . She had the same aristocratic features and she had long , blond hair . She wore an off-white chiffon dress . Next to Lucy Wyatt she looked washed out . " May I present my daughter , Marianne ? " Count Hoffman said . " I 'm sorry we 're late , " He apologized . " The plane was delayed at La Guardia . " " Oh , what a shame , " Kate said . Tony was aware that Kate had arranged the delay . She had had the Wyatts and the Hoffmans flown up to Maine in separate planes , so that the Wyatts would arrive early and the Hoffmans late . " We were just having a drink . What would you like ? "  | " A Scotch , please , " Count Hoffman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear ? " " Nothing , thank you . " A few minutes later , the other guests began to arrive , and Tony circulated among them , playing the part of the gracious host . No one except Kate could have guessed how little the festivities meant to him . It was not , Kate knew , that Tony was bored . It was simply that he was completely removed from what was happening around him . He had lost his pleasure in people . It worried Kate . Two tables had been set in the large dining room . Kate seated Marianne Hoffman between a Supreme Court justice and a senator at one table , and she seated Lucy Wyatt on Tony 's right at the other table . All the men in the room  --  married and unmarried  --  were eyeing Lucy . Kate listened to Lucy trying to draw Tony into conversatio ' . It was obvious that she liked him . Kate smiled to herself . It was a good beginning . The following morning , Saturday , at breakfast , Charlie Wyatt said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got sittin ' out there , Mrs. Blackwell . How big is it ? " " I 'm really not quite sure . " Kate turned to her son . " Tony , how large is the Corsair ? " His mother knew exactly how large it was , but Tony said politely , " Eighty f-feet . " " We do n't go in much for boats in Texas . We 're in too much of a hurry . We do most of our travelin ' in planes . " Wyatt gave a booming laugh . " Guess maybe I 'll try it and get my feet wet . " Kate smiled . " I was hoping you would let me show you around the island . We could go out on the boat tomorrow . " Charlie Wyatt looked at her thoughtfully and said , " That 's mighty kind of you , Mrs. Blackwell . " Tony quietly watched the two of them and said nothing . The first move had just been made , and he wondered whether Charlie Wyatt was aware of it . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never come up against anyone like Kate Blackwell .  | Kate turned to Tony and Lucy . " It 's such a beautiful day . Why do n't you two go for a sail in the catboat ? " Before Tony could refuse , Lucy said , " Oh , I 'd love that . " " I 'm s-sorry , " Tony said curtly . " I 'm expecting s-some overseas calls . " Tony could feel his mother 's disapproving eyes on him . Kate turned to Marine Hoffman . " I have n't seen your father this morning . " " He 's out exploring the island . He 's an early riser . " " I understand you like to ride . We have a fine stable here . " " Thank you , Mrs. Blackwell . I 'll just wander around , if you do n't mind . " " Of course not . " Kate turned back to Tony . " Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about taking Miss Wyatt for a sail ? " There was steel in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small victory , but it was a victory nevertheless . The battle was joined , and Tony had no intention of losing it . Not this time . His mother no longer had the power to deceive him . She had used him as a pawn once , and he was fully aware she was planning to try it again ; but this time she would fail . She wanted the Wyatt Oil &; Tool Company . Charlie Wyatt had no intention of merging or selling his company . But every man has a weakness , and Kate had found his : his daughter . If Lucy were to marry into the Blackwell family , a merger of some kind would become inevitable . Tony looked across the breakfast table at his mother , despising her . She had baited the trap well . Lucy was not only beautiful , she was intelligent and charming . But she was as much of a pawn in this sick game as Tony was , and nothing in the world could induce him to touch her . This was a battle between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . " Tony , before your phone call comes in , why do n't you show Miss Wyatt the gar-dens ? " There was no way Tony could refuse graciously . " All right . " He would make it short .  | Kate turned to Charlie Wyatt . " Are you interested in rare books ? We have quite a collection in the library . " " I 'm interested in anything you want to show me , " the Texan said . Almost as an afterthought , Kate turned back to Marianne Hoffman . " Will you be all right , dear ? " " I 'll be fine , thank you , Mrs. Blackwell . Please do n't worry about me . " " I wo n't , " Kate said . And Tony knew she meant it . Miss Hoffman was of no use to Kate , and so she dismissed her . It was done with a light charm and a smile , but beneath it was a single-minded ruthlessness that Tony detested . Lucy was watching him . " Are you ready , Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door . They were not quite out of earshot when Tony heard his mother say , " Do n't they make a lovely couple ? " The two of them walked through the large , formal gardens toward the dock where the Corsair was tied up . There were acres and acres of wildly colored flowers staining the summer air with their scent . " This is a heavenly place , " Lucy said . " Yes . " " We do n't have flowers like these in Texas . " " No ? " " It 's so quiet and peaceful here . " " Yes . " Lucy stopped abruptly and turned to face Tony . He saw the anger in her face . " Have I said something to offend you ? " he asked . " You have n't said anything . That 's what I find offensive . All I can get out of you is a yes or a no . You make me feel as though I 'm  --  I 'm chasing you . " " Are you ? " She laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk , I think we might have something . "  | Tony grinned . " What are you thinking ? " Lucy asked . " Nothing . " He was thinking of his mother , and how much she hated losing . Kate was showing Charlie Wyatt the large , oak-paneled library . On the shelves were first edition of Oliver Goldsmith , Laurence Sterne , Tobias Smollett and John Donne , along with a Ben Jonson first folio . There was Samuel Butler and John Bunyan , and the rare 1813 privately printed edition of Queen Mob . Wyatt walked along the shelves of treasures , his eyes gleaming . He paused in front of a beautifully bound edition of John Keats 's Endymion . " This is a Roseberg copy , " Charlie Wyatt said . Kate looked at him in surprise . " Yes . There are only two known copies . " " I have the other one , " Wyatt told her . " I should have known , " Kate laughed . " That good of Texas boy ' act you put on had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? It 's good camouflage . " " Where did you go to school ? " " Colorado School of Mining , then Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship . " He studied Kate a moment . " I 'm told it was you who got me invited to that White House conference . " She shrugged . " I merely mentioned your name . They were delighted to have you . " " That was mighty kind of you , Kate . Now , as long as you and I are alone , why do n't you tell me exactly what 's on your mind ? " Tony was at work in his private study , a small room off the main downstairs hallway . He was seated in a deep armchair when he heard the door open and someone come in . He turned to look . It was Marianne Hoffman . Before Tony could open his mouth to make his presence known , he heard her gasp . She was looking at the paintings on the wall . They were Tony 's paintings  --  the few he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only room in the house where he  | would allow them to be hung . He watched her walk around the room , going from painting to painting , and it was too late to say anything . " I do n't believe it , " she murmured . And Tony felt a sudden anger within him . He knew they were not that bad . As he moved , the leather of his chair creaked , and Marianne turned and saw him . " Oh ! I 'm sorry , " she apologized . " I did n't know anyone was in here . " Tony rose . " That 's quite all right . " His tone was rude . He disliked having his sanctuary invaded . " Were you looking for something ? ' " No . I  --  I was just wandering around . Your collection of paintings belongs in a museum . " " Except for these , " Tony heard himself saying . She was puzzled by the hostility in his voice . She turned to look at the paintings again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry if they do n't appeal to you . " " They 're fantastic ! " She moved toward him . " I do n't understand . If you can do this , why would you ever want to do anything else ? You 're wonderful . I do n't mean you 're good . I mean you 're wonderful . " Tony stood there , not listening , just wanting her to get out . " I wanted to be a painter , " Marianne said . " I studied with Oskar Kokoschka for a year . I finally quit because I knew I never could be as good as I wanted to be . But you ! " She turned to the paintings again . " Did you study in Paris ? " He wished she would leave him alone . " Yes . " " And you quit just like that ? " " Yes . " " What a pity . You ? " " There you are ! " They both turned . Kate was standing in the doorway . She eyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marianne . " I 've been looking everywhere for you , Marianne . Your father mentioned that you like orchids . You must see our greenhouse . "  | " Thank you , " Marianne murmured . " I 'm really ? " Kate turned to Tony . " Tony , perhaps you should see to your other guests . " There was a note of sharp displeasure in her voice . She took Marianne 's arm , and they were one . There was a fascination to watching his mother maneuver people . It was done so smoothly . Not a move was wasted . It had started with the Wyatts arriving early and the Hoffmans arriving late . Lucy being placed next to him at every meal . The private conferences with Charlie Wyatt . It was so damned obvious , and yet Tony had to admit to himself that it was obvious only because he had the key . He knew his mother and the way her mind worked . Lucy Wyatt was a lovely girl . She would make a wonderful wife for someone , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother was a ruthless , calculating bitch , and as long as Tony remembered that , he was safe from her machinations . He wondered what her next move would be . He did not have to wait long to find out . They were on the terrace having cocktails . " Mr. Wyatt has been kind enough to invite us to his ranch next weekend , " Kate told Tony . " Is n't that lovely ? " Her face radiated her pleasure . " I 've never seen a Texas ranch . " Kruger-Brent owned a ranch in Texas , and it was probably twice as big as the Wyatt spread . " You will come , wo n't you , Tony ? " Charlie Wyatt asked . Lucy said , " Please do . " They were ganging up on him . It was a challenge . He decided to accept it . " I 'd be d-delighted . " " Good . " There was real pleasure on Lucy 's face . And on Kate 's . If Lucy is planning to seduce me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt done to Tony by his mother and Dominique had implanted in him such a deep distrust of females that his only association with them now was with high-priced call girls . Of all the female species , they were the most honest . All they wanted was money and told you how much up front . You paid  | for what you got , and you got what you paid for . No complications , no tears , no deceit . Lucy Wyatt was in for a surprise . Early Sunday morning , Tony went down to the pool for a swim . Marianne Hoffman was already in the water , wearing a white maillot . She had a lovely figure , tall and slender and graceful . Tony stood there watching her cutting cleanly through the water , her arms flashing up and down in a regular , graceful rhythm . She saw Tony and swam over to him . " Good morning . " " Morning . You 're good , " Tony said . Marianne smiled . " I love sports . I get that from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pool , and Tony handed her a towel . He watched as she unselfconsciously dried her hair . " Have you had breakfast ? " Tony asked . " No . I was n't sure the cook would be up this early . " " This is a hotel . There 's twenty-four-hour service . " She smiled up at him . " Nice . " " Where is your home ? " " Mostly in Munich . We live in an old schloss  --  a castle  --  outside the city . " " Where were you brought up ? " Marianne sighed . " That 's a long story . During the war , I was sent away to school in Switzerland . After that , I went to Oxford , studied at the Sorbonne and lived in London for a few years . " She looked directly into his eyes . " That 's where I 've been . Where have you been ? " " Oh , New York , Maine , Switzerland , South Africa , a few years in the South Pacific during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , as though he were saying too much . " Forgive me if I seem to pry , but I ca n't imagine why you stopped painting . " " It 's not important , " Tony said curtly . " Let 's have breakfast . " They ate alone on the terrace overlooking the sparkling sweep of the bay . She was easy to talk to . There was a dignity about  | her , a gentleness that Tony found appealing . She did not flirt , she did not chatter . She seemed genuinely in ested in him . Tony found himself attracted to this quiet , sensive woman . He could not help wondering how much of that attraction was due to the thought that it would spite his mother . " When do you go back to Germany ? " " Next week , " Marianne replied . " I 'm getting married . " Her words caught him off guard . " Oh , " Tony said lamely . " That 's great . Who is he ? " " He 's a doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she added that ? Did it have some significance ? On an impulse , Tony asked , " Will you have dinner with me in New York ? " She studied him , weighing her answer . " I would enjoy that . " Tony smiled , pleased . " It 's a date . " They had dinner at a little seashore restaurant on Long Island . Tony wanted Marianne to himself , away from the eyes of his mother . It was an innocent evening , but Tony knew that if his mother learned about it , she would find some way to poison it . This was a private thing between him and Marianne , and for the brief time it existed , Tony wanted nothing to spoil it . Tony enjoyed Marianne 's company even more than he had anticipated . She had a quick , sly sense of humor , and Tony found himself laughing more than he had laughed since he left Paris . She made him feel lighthearted and carefree . When do you go back to Germany ? Next week ... I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a great deal of Marianne . He canceled his trip to Canada , and he was not certain why . He had thought it might be a form of rebellion against his mother 's plan , a petty vengeance , but if that had been true in the beginning , it was no longer true . He found himself drawn to Marianne more and more strongly . He loved her honesty . It was a quality he had despaired of ever finding . Since Marianne was a tourist in New York , Tony took her  | everywhere . They climbed the Statue of Liberty and rode the ferry to Staten Island , went to the top of the Empire State Building , and ate in Chinatown . They spent an entire day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and an afternoon at the Frick Collection . They shared the same tastes . They carefully avoided speaking of any personal things , and yet both were conscious of the powerful sexual undercurren* , between them . The days spilled into one another , and it was Friday , the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When do you fly back to Germany ? " " Monday morning . " There was no joy in her voice . Tony left for Houston that afternoon . He could have gone with his mother in one of the company planes , but he preferred to avoid any situation where he and Kate would be alone together . As far as he was concerned , his mother was solely a business partner : brilliant and powerful , devious and dangerous . There was a Rolls-Royce to pick up Tony at the William P. Hobby Airport in Houston , and he was driven to the ranch by a chauffeur dressed in Levi 's and a colorful sport shirt . " Most folks like to fly direct to the ranch , " the driver told Tony . " Mr. Wyatt 's got a big landin ' strip there . From here , it 's ' bout an hour 's drive to the gate , then another half hour before we git to the main house . " Tony thought he was exaggerating , but he was wrong . The Wyatt Ranch turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They drove through the main gate onto a private road , and after thirty minutes they began to pass generator buildings and barns and corrals and guest houses and servants ' bungalows . The main house was an enormous one-story ranch house that seemed to go on forever . Tony thought it was depressingly ugly . Kate had already arrived . She and Charlie Wyatt were seated on the terrace overlooking a swimming pool the size of a small lake . They were in the midst of an intense conversation when Tony appeared . When Wyatt saw him , he broke off abruptly in the middle of a sentence . Tony sensed that he had been the subject of their discussion .  | " Here 's our boy ! Have a good trip , Tony ? " " Yes , th-thank you . " " Lucy was hopin ' you 'd be able to catch aiearlier plane , " Kate said . Tony turned to look at his mother . " Was sh-she ? " Charlie Wyatt clapped Tony on the shoulder . " We 're puttin ' on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody 's flyin ' in for it . " " That 's very k-kind of you , " Tony said . If they 're planning to serve fatted calf , he thought , they 're going to go hungry . Lucy appeared , wearing a white shirt and tight-fitting , wellworn jeans , and Tony had to admit she was breathtakingly lovely . She went up to him and took his arm . " Tony ! I was wondering if you were coming . " " S-sorry I 'm late , " Tony said . " I had some b-business to finish up . " Lucy gave him a warm smile . " It does n't matter , as long as you 're here . What would you like to do this afternoon ? " ' What do you have to offer ? " Lucy looked him in the eye . " Anything you want , " she said softly . Kate Blackwell and Charlie Wyatt beamed . The barbecue was spectacilar , even by Texas standards . Approximately two hundred guests had arrived by private plane , Mercedes or Rolls-Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds . Half a dozen bartenders dispensed champagne , whiskey , soft drinks and beer , while four chefs busily prepared food over outdoor fires . There was barbecued beef , lamb , steaks , chicken and duck . There were bubbling earthen pots of chili , and whole lobsters ; crabs and corn on the cob were cooking in the ground . There were baked potatoes and yams and fresh peas in the pod , six kinds of salads , homemade hot biscuits , and corn bread with honey and jam . Four dessert tables were laden with freshly baked pies , cakes and puddings , and a dozen flavors of homemade ice cream . It  | was the most conspicuous waste Tony had ever seen . It was , he supposed , the difference between new money and old money . Old money 's motto was , If you have it , hide it . New money 's motto was , If you have it , flaunt it . This was flaunting on a scale that was unbelievable . The women were dressed in daring gowns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side watching the guests gorging themselves , calling out noisily to old friends . He felt as though he were attending some mindless , decadent rite . Every time he turned around , Tony found himself confronted with a waiter carrying a tray containing large crocks of beluga caviar or pate or champagne . It seemed to Tony that there were almost as many servants as guests . He listened to conversations around him . " He came out here from New York to sell me a bill of goods , and I said , You 're wastin ' your time , mister . No good oil deal gets east of Houston ... ' " " You got ta watch out for the smooth talkers . They 're all hat and no cattle ... " Lucy appeared at Tony 's side . " You 're not eating . " She was watching him intently . " Is anything wrong , Tony ? " " No , everything 's fine . It 's quite a party . " She grinned . " You ai n't seen nothin ' yet , pardner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fireworks display ? " " Uh-huh . " She touched Tony 's arm . " Sorry about the mob scene . It 's not always like this . Daddy wanted to impress your mother . " She smiled . " Tomorrow they 'll all be gone . " So will I , Tony thought grimly . It had been a mistake for him to come here . If his mother wanted the Wyatt Oil &; Tool Company so badly , she would have to figure out some other way to get it . His eyes searched the crowd for his mother , and he saw her in the middle of an admiring group . She was beautiful . She was almost sixty years old , but she looked ten years younger . Her face was unlined , and her body was firm and trim , thanks to exercise and daily massage . She was as disciplined with herself as with everyone around her , and in a perverse way , Tony ad-  | mired her . To a casual onlooker , Kate Bkwell seemed to be having a marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaming , laughing . She 's loathing every moment of this , Tony thought . There is n't anything she wo n't suffer to get what she wants . He thought of Marianne and of how much she would have hated this kind of senseless orgy . The thought of her was a sudden ache in him . I 'm marrying a doctor . I 've known him all my life . Half an hour later when Lucy came looking for Tony , he was on his way back to New York . He called Marianne from a telephone booth at the airport . " I want to see you . " There was no hesitation . " Yes . " Tony had not been able to get Marianne Hoffman out of his thoughts . He had been alone for a long time , but he had not felt lonely . Being away from Marianne was a loneliness , a feeling that a part of him was missing . Being with her was a warmth , a celebration of life , a chasing away of the ugly dark shadows that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he let Marianne go , he would be lost . He needed her as he had never needed anyone in his life . Marianne met him at his apartment , and as she walked in the door , there was a hunger in Tony that he had thought forever dead . And looking at her , he knew the hunger was hers , too , and there were no words for the miracle of it . She went into his arms , and their emotion was an irresistible riptide that caught them both up and swept them away in a glorious explosion , an eruption , and a contentment beyond words . They were floating together in a velvety softness that knew no time or place , lost in the wondrous glory and magic of each other . Later they lay spent , holding each other , her hair soft against his face . " I 'm going to marry you , Marianne . " She took his face in her hands and looked searchingly into his eyes . " Are you sure , Tony ? " Her voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p 300 " Your engagement ? " " No . I 'll break it off . I 'm concerned about your mother . " " She has nothing to do with ? " " No . Let me finish , Tony . She 's planning for you to marry Lucy Wyatt . " " That 's her plan . " He took her in his arms again . " My plans are right here . " " She 'll hate me , Tony . I do n't want that . " " Do you know what I want ? " Tony whispered . And the miracle started all over again . It was another forty-eight hours before Kate Blackwell heard from Tony . He had disappeared from the Wyatt Ranch without an explanation or good-bye and had flown back to New York . Charlie Wyatt was baffled , and Lucy Wyatt was furious . Kate had made awkward apologies and had taken the company plane back to New York that night . When she reached home , she telephoned Tony at his apartment . There was no answer . Nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office when the private phone on her desk rang . She knew who it was before she picked it up . " Tony , are you all right ? " " I 'm f-fine , Mother . " " Where are you ? " " On my h-honeymoon . Marianne Hoffman and I were mmarried yesterday . " There was a long , long silence . " Are you there , M-mother ? " " Yes . I 'm here . " " You might s-say congratulations , or m-much happiness or one of those c-customary phrases . " There was a mocking bitterness in his voice . Kate said , " Yes . Yes , of course , I wish you much happiness , Son . " " Thank you , M-mother . " And the line went dead . Kate replaced the receiver and pressed down an intercom button . " Would you please come in , Brad ? "  | When Brad Rogers walked into the office , Kate said , " Tony just called . " Brad took one look at Kate 's face and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " " Tony did it , " Kate smiled . " We 've got the Hoffman empire in our lap . " Brad Rogers sank into a chair . " I ca n't believe it ! I know how stubborn Tony can be . How did you ever get him to marry Marianne Hoffman ? " " It was really very simple , " Kate sighed . " I pushed him in the wrong direction . " But she knew it was really the right direction . Marianne would be a wonderful wife for Tony . She would dispel the darkness in him . Lucy had had a hysterectomy . Marianne would give him a son .  | Six months from the day Tony and Marianne were married , the Hoffman company was absorbed into Kruger-Brent , Ltd . The formal signing of the contracts took place in Munich as a gesture to Frederick Hoffman , who would run the subsidiary from Germany . Tony had been surprised by the meekness with which his mother accepted his marriage . It was not like her to lose gracefully , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride returned from their honeymoon in the Bahamas , and had told Tony how pleased she was with the marriage . What puzzled Tony was that her sentiments seemed genuine . It was too quick a turnaround , out of character for her . Perhaps , Tony decided , he did not understand his mother as well as he thought he did . The marriage was a brilliant success from the beginning . Marianne filled a long-felt need in Tony , and everyone around him noticed the change in him  --  especially Kate . When Tony took business trips , Marianne accompanied him . They played together , they laughed together , they truly enjoyed each other . Watching them , Kate thought happily , I have done well for my son .  | It was Marianne who succeeded in healing the breach between Tony and his mother . When they returned from their honeymoon , Marianne said , " I want to invite your mother to dinner . " " No . You do n't know her , Marianne . She ? " " I want to get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , but in the end he gave in . Tony had been prepared for a grim evening , but he had been surprised . Kate had been touchingly happy to be with them . The following week Kate invited them to the house for dinner , and after that it became a weekly ritual . Kate and Marianne became friends . They spoke to each other over the telephone several times a week , and lunched together at least once a week . They were meeting for lunch at Lutece , and the moment Marianne walked in , Kate knew something was wrong . " I 'd like a double whiskey , please , " Marianne told the captain . " Over ice . " As a rule , Marianne drank only wine . " What 's happened , Marianne ? " " I 've been to see Dr. Harley . ' Kate felt a sudden stab of alarm . " You 're not ill , are you ? " " No . I 'm just fine . Only . . . " The whole story came tumbling out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been feeling well , and she had made an appointment with John Harley .... " You look healthy enough , " Dr. Harley smiled . " How old are you , Mrs. Blackwell ? " " Twenty-three . " " Any history of heart disease in your family ? " " No . " He was making notes . " Cancer ? " " No . " " Are your parents alive ? "  | " My father is . My mother died in an accident . " " Have you ever had mumps ? " " No . " " Measles ? " " Yes . When I was ten . " " Whooping cough ? " " No . " " Any surgery ? " " Tonsils . I was nine . " " Other than that , you 've never been hospitalized for any-thing ? " " No . Well , yes  --  that is , once . Briefly . " " What was that for ? " " I was on the girls ' hockey team at school and during a game I blacked out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there two days . It was really nothing . " " Did you suffer an injury during the game ? " " No . I  --  I just blacked out . " " How old were you then ? " " Sixteen . The doctor said it was probably some kind of adolescent glandular upset . " John Harley sat forward in his chair . " When you woke up , do you remember if you felt any weakness on either side of your body ? " Marianne thought a moment . " As a matter of fact , yes . My right side . But it went away in a few days . I have n't had anything like it since . " " Did you have headaches ? Blurred vision ? " " Yes . But they went away , too . " She was beginning to be alarmed . " Do you think there 's something wrong with me , Dr. Harley ? " " I 'm not sure . I 'd like to make a few tests just to be on the safe side . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a cerebral angiogram . Nothing to be concerned about . We can have it done right away . " Three days later , Marianne received a call from Dr. Harley 's  | nurse asking her to come in . John Harley was waiting for her in his office . " Well , we 've solved the mystery . " " Is it something bad ? " " Not really . The angiogram showed that what you had , Mrs. Blackwell , was a small stroke . Medically , it 's called a berry aneurysm , and it 's very common in women  --  particularly in teenage girls . A small blood vessel in the brain broke and leaked small amounts of blood . The pressure is what caused the headaches and blurred vision . Fortunately , those things are selfhealing . " Marianne sat there listening , her mind fighting panic . " What  --  what does all this mean , exactly ? Could it happen again ? " " It 's very unlikely . " He smiled . " Unless you 're planning to go out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " Tony and I like to ride and play tennis . Is that ? ? " " As long as you do n't overdo , everything goes . From tennis to sex . No problem . " She smiled in relief . " Thank God " As Marianne rose , John Harley said , " There is one thing , Mrs. Blackwell . If you and Tony are planning to have children , I would advise adopting them . " Marianne froze . " You said I was perfectly normal . " " You are . Unfortunately , pregnancy increases the vascular volume enormously . And during the last six to eight weeks of pregnancy , there 's an additional increase in blood pressure . With the history of that aneurysm , the risk factor would be unacceptably high . It would not only be dangerous  --  it could be fatal . Adoptions are really quite easy these days . I can ar-range ? " But Marianne was no longer listening . She was hearing Tony 's voice : I want us to have a baby . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't bear to hear any more , " Marianne told Kate . " I ran out of his office and came straight here . "  | Kate made a tremendous effort not to let her feelings show . It was a stunning blow . But there had to be a way . There was always a way . She managed a smile and said , " Well ! I was afraid it was going to be something much worse . " " But , Kate , Tony and I want so much to have a baby . " " Marianne , Dr. Harley is an alarmist . You had a minor problem years ago , and Harley 's trying to turn it into something important . You know how doctors are . " She took Marianne 's hand . " You feel well , do n't you , darling ? " " I felt wonderful until ? " " Well , there you are . You are n't going around having any fainting spells ? " " No . " " Because it 's all over . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the risks ? " Kate sighed . " Marianne , every time a woman gets pregnant , there 's always a risk . Life is full of risks . The important thing in life is to decide which risks are the ones worth taking , do n't you agree ? " " Yes . " Marianne sat there thinking . She made her decision . " You 're right . Let 's not say anything to Tony . It would only worry him . We 'll keep it our secret . " Kate thought , I could bloody well kill John Harley for scaring her to death . " It will be our secret , " Kate agreed . Three months later , Marianne became pregnant . Tony was thrilled . Kate was quietly triumphant . Dr. John Harley was horrified . " I 'll arrange for an immediate abortion , " he told Marianne . " No , Dr. Harley . I feel fine . I 'm going to have the baby . " When Marianne told Kate about her visit , Kate stormed into John Harley 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion ? " " Kate , I told her that if she carries that baby to term , there 's a chance it might kill her . "  | " You do n't know that . She 's going to be fine . Stop alarming her . " Eight months later , at four A.M. in early February , Marianne 's labor pains began prematurely . Her moans awakened Tony . He began hurriedly dressing . " Do n't worry , darling . I 'll have you at the hospital in no time . " The pains were agonizing . " Please hurry . " She wondered whether she should have told Tony about her conversations with Dr. Harley . No , Kate had been right . It was her decision to make . Life was so wonderful that God would not let anything bad happen to her . When Marianne and Tony arrived at the hospital , everything was in readiness . Tony was escorted to a waiting room . Marianne was taken into an examining room . The obstetrician , Dr. Mattson , took Marianne 's blood pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said to his nurse , " Get her into the operating room  --  fast ! " Tony was at the cigarette machine in the hospital corridor when a voice behind him said , " Well , well , if it is n't Rembrandt . " Tony turned . He recognized the man who had been with Dominique in front of her apartment building . What had she called him ? Ben . The man was staring at Tony , an antagonistic expression on his face . Jealousy ? What had Dominique told him ? At that moment , Dominique appeared . She said to Ben , " The nurse said Michelline is in intensive care . We 'll come ? " She saw Tony , and stopped . " Tony ! What are you doing here ? " " My wife is having a baby . " " Did your mother arrange it ? " Ben asked . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Dominique told me your mother arranges everything for you , sonny . " " Ben ! Stop it ! " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby ? Is n't that what you said ? " Tony turned to Dominique . " What is he talking about ? "  | " Nothing , " she said quickly . " Ben , let 's get out of here . " But Ben was enjoying himself . " I wish I had a mother like yours , buddy boy . You want a beautiful model to sleep with , she buys you one . You want to have an art exhibition in Paris , she arranges it for you . You ? " " You 're crazy . " " Am I ? " Ben turned to Dominique . " Does n't he know ? " " Do n't I know what ? " Tony demanded . " Nothing , Tony . " " He said my mother arranged the exhibition in Paris . That 's a lie , is n't it ? " He saw the expression on Dominique 's face . " Is n't it ? " " No , " Dominique said reluctantly . " You mean she had to pay Goerg to  --  to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your paintings . " " Tell him about the art critic , " Ben urged . " That 's enough , Ben ! " Dominique turned to go . Tony grabbed her arm . " Wait ! What about him ? Did my mother arrange for him to be at the exhibit ? " " Yes . " Dominique 's voice had dropped to a whisper . " But he hated my paintings . " She could hear the pain in his voice . " No , Tony . He did n't . Andre d'Usseau told your mother you could have become a great artist . " And he was face to face with the unbelievable . " My mother paid d'Usseau to destroy me ? " " Not to destroy you . She believed she was doing it for your own good . " The enormity of what his mother had done was staggering . Everything she had told him was a lie . She had never intended to let him live his own life . And Andre d'Usseau ! How could a man like that be bought ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilde could have been referring to Kate when he talked of someone who knew the price of everything , the value of nothing . Everything had always been for the company . And the company was Kate Blackwell . Tony turned and walked blindly down the corridor .  | In the operating room , the doctors were fighting desperately to save Marianne 's life . Her blood pressure was alarmingly low , and her heartbeat was erratic . She was given oxygen and a blood transfusion , but it was useless . Marianne was unconscious from a cerebral hemorrhage when the first baby was delivered , and dead three minutes later when the second twin was taken . Tony heard a voice calling , " Mr. Blackwell . " He turned . Dr. Mattson was at his side . " You have two beautiful , healthy twin daughters , Mr. Blackwell . " Tony saw the look in his eyes . " Marianne  --  she 's all right , is n't she ? " Dr. MattsoI took a deep breath . " I 'm so sorry . We did everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She what ? " It was a scream . Tony grabbed Dr. Mattson 's lapels and shook him . " You 're lying ! She 's not dead . " " Mr. Blackwell ? " " Where is she ? I want to see her . " " You ca n't go in just now . They 're preparing her ? " Tony cried out , " You killed her , you bastard ! You killed her . " lie began attacking the doctor . Two interns hurried in and grabbed Tony 's arms . " Now take it easy , Mr. Blackwell . " Tony fought like a madman . " I want to see my wife ! " Dr. John Harley hurried up to the group . " Let him go , " he commanded . " Leave us alone . " Dr. Mattson and the interns left . Tony was weeping brokenly . " John , they k-killed Marianne . They m-murdered her . " " She 's dead , Tony , and I 'm sorry . But no one murdered her . I told her months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " It took a long moment for the words to sink in . " What are you talking about ? " " Marianne did n't tell you ? Your mother did n't say any-thing ? "  | Tony was staring at him , his eyes uncomprehending . " My mother ? " " She thought I was being an alarmist . She advised Marianne to go ahead with it . I 'm so sorry , Tony . I 've seen the twins . They 're beautiful . Would n't you like to ? ? " Tony was gone . Kate 's butler opened the door for Tony . " Good morning , Mr. Blackwell . " " Good morning , Lester . " The butler took in Tony 's disheveled appearance . " Is everything all right , sir ? " " Everything is fine . Would you make me a cup of coffee , Les-ter ? " " Certainly , sir . " Tony watched the butler move toward the kitchen . Now , Tony , the voice in his head commanded . Yes . Now . Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cabinet that held the gun collection , and he stared at the gleaming array of instruments of death . Open the cabinet , Tony . He opened it . He selected a revolver from the gun rack and checked the barrel to make sure it was loaded . She 'll be upstairs , Tony . Tony turned and started up the stairs . He knew now that it was not his mother 's fault that she was evil . She was possessed , and he was going to cure her . The company had taken her soul , and Kate was not responsible for what she did . His mother and the company had become one , and when he killed her , the company would die . He was outside Kate 's bedroom door . Open the door , the voice commanded . Tony opened the door . Kate was dressing in front of a mirror when she heard the door open . " Tony ! What on earth ? " He carefully aimed the gun at her and began squeezing the trigger .  | The right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title or estate  --  is deeply rooted in history . Among royal families in Europe a high official is present at every birth of a possible heir to a queen or princess so that should twins be born , the right of succession will not be in dispute . Dr. Mattson was careful to note which twin had been delivered first . Everyone agreed that the Blackwell twins were the most beautiful babies they had ever seen . They were healthy and unusually lively , and the nurses at the hospital kept finding excuses to go in and look at them . Part of the fascination , although none of the nurses would have admitted it , was the mysterious stories that were circulating about the twins ' family . Their mother had died during childbirth . The twins ' father had disappeared , and there were rumors he had murdered his mother , but no one was able to substantiate the reports . There was nothing about it in the newspapers , save for a brief item that Tony Blackwell had suffered a nervous breakdown over the death of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question Dr. Harley , he gave them a brusque , " No comment . " The past few days had been hell for John Harley . As long as  | he lived , he would remember the scene when he reached Kate Blackwell 's bedroom after a frantic phone call from the butler . Kate was lying on the floor in a coma , bullet wounds in her neck and chest , her blood spilling onto the white rug . Tony was going through her closets , slashing his mother 's clothes to shreds with a pair of scissors . Dr. Harley took one quick look at Kate and hurriedly telephoned for an ambulance . He knelt at Kate 's side and felt her pulse . It was weak and thready , and her face was turning blue . She was going into shock . He swiftly gave her an injection of adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate . " What happened ? " Dr. Harley asked . The butler was soaked in perspiration . " I  --  I do n't know . Mr. Blackwell asked me to make him some coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of gunfire . I ran upstairs and found Mrs. Blackwell on the floor , like this . Mr. Blackwell was standing over her , saying , It ca n't hurt you anymore , Mother . I killed it . ' And he went into the closet and started cutting her dresses . " Dr. Harley turned to Tony . " What are you doing , Tony ? " A savage slash . " I 'm helping Mother . I 'm destroying the company . It killed Marianne , you know . " He continued slashing at the dresses in Kate 's closet . Kate was rushed to the emergency ward of a midtown private hospital owned by Kruger-Brent , Ltd . She was given four blood transfusions during the operation to remove the bullets . It took three male nurses to force Tony into an ambulance , and it was only after Dr. Harley gave him an injection that Tony was quiet . A police unit had responded to the ambulance call , and Dr. Harley summoned Brad Rogers to deal with them . Through means that Dr. Harley did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shooting . Dr. Harley went to the hospital to visit Kate in intensive care . Her first words were a whispered , " Where 's my son ? " " He 's being taken care of , Kate . He 's all right . " Tony had been taken to a private sanitarium in Connecticut .  | " John , why did he try to kill me ? Why ? " The anguish in her voice was unbearable . " He blames you for Marianne 's death . " " That 's insane ! " John Harley made no comment . He blames you for Marianne 's death . Long after Dr. Harley had left , Kate lay there , refusing to accept those words . She had loved Marianne because she made Tony happy . Everything I have done has been for you , my son . All my dreams were for you . How could you not know that ? And he hated her so much he had tried to kill her . She was filled with such a deep agony that she wanted to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done what was right . They were wrong . Tony was a weakling . They had all been weaklings . Her father had been too weak to face his son 's death . Her mother had been too weak to face life alone . But I am not weak , Kate thought . I can face this . I can face anything . I 'm going to live . I 'll survive . The company will survive .  | Kate recuperated at Dark Harbor , letting the sun and the sea heal her . Tony was in a private asylum , where he could get the best care possible . Kate had psychiatrists flown in from Paris , Vienna and Berlin , but when all the examinations and tests had been completed , the diagnosis was the same : Her son was a homicidal schizophrenic and paranoiac . " He does n't respond to drugs or psychiatric treatment , and he 's violent . We have to keep him under restraint . " " What kind of restraint ? " Kate asked . " He 's in a padded cell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straitjacket . " " Is that necessary ? " " Without it , Mrs. Blackwell , he would kill anyone who got near him . " She closed her eyes in pain . This was not her sweet , gentle Tony they were talking about . It was a stranger , someone possessed . She opened her eyes . " Is there nothing that can be done ? " " Not if we ca n't reach his mind . We 're keeping him on drugs ,  | but the moment they wear off , he gets manic again . We ca n't continue this treatment indefinitely . " Kate stood very straight . " What do you suggest , Doctor ? " " In similar cases , we 've found that removing a small portion of the brain has produced remarkable results . " Kate swallowed . " A lobotomy ? " " That is correct . Your son will still be able to function in every way , except that he will no longer have any strong dysfunctional emotions . " Kate sat there , her mind and body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menninger Clinic , broke the silence . " I know how difficult this must be for you , Mrs. Blackwell . If you 'd like to think about ? " " If that 's the only thing that will stop his torment , " Kate said , " do it . " Frederick Hoffman wanted his granddaughters . " I will take them back to Germany with me . " It seemed to Kate that he had aged twenty years since Marianne 's death . Kate felt sorry for him , but she had no intention of giving up Tony 's children . " They need a woman 's care , Frederick . Marianne would have wanted them brought up here . You 'll come and visit them often . " And he was finally persuaded . The twins were moved into Kate 's home , and a nursery suite was set up for them . Kate interviewed governesses , and finally hired a young French woman named Solange Dunas . Kate named the first-born Eve , and her twin , Alexandra . They were identical  --  impossible to tell apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mirror , and Kate marveled at the double miracle that her son and Marianne had created . They were both bright babies , quick and responsive , but even after a few weeks , Eve seemed more mature than Alexandra . Eve was the first to crawl and talk and walk . Alexandra followed quickly , but from the beginning it was Eve who was the leader . Alexandra adored her sister and tried to  | imitate everything she did . Kate spent as much time with her granddaughters as possible . They made her feel young . And Kate began to dream again . One day , when I 'm old and ready to retire .. . On the twins ' first birthday , Kate gave them a party . They each had an identical birthday cake , and there were dozens of presents from friends , company employees and the household staff . Their second birthday party seemed to follow almost immediately . Kate could not believe how rapidly the time went by and how quickly the twins were growing . She was able to discern even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stronger , was more daring , Alexandra was softer , content to follow her sister 's lead . With no mother or father , Kate thought repeatedly , it 's a blessing that they have each other and love each other so much . The night before their fifth birthday , . Eve tried to murder Alexandra . It is written in Genesis 25 : 22-23 : And the children struggled together within her .. . And the Lord said unto her , Two nations are in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger . In the case of Eve and Alexandra , Eve had no intention of serving her younger sister . Eve had hated her sister for as long as she could remember . She went into a silent rage when someone picked up Alexandra , or petted her or gave her a present . Eve felt she was being cheated . She wanted it all for herself  --  all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She could not have even a birthday of her own . She hated Alexandra for looking like her , dressing like her , stealing the part of her grandmother 's love that belonged to her . Alexandra adored Eve , and five despised her for that . Alexandra was generous , eager to  | give up her toys and dolls , and that filled Eve with still more contempt . Eve shared nothing . What was hers belonged to her ; but it was not enough . She wanted everything Alexandra had . At night , under the watchful eye of Solange Dunas , both girls would say their prayers aloud , but Eve always added a silent prayer begging God to strike Alexandra dead . When the prayer went unanswered , Eve decided she would have to take care of it herself . Their fifth birthday was only a few days away , and Eve could not bear the thought of sharing another party with Alexandra . They were her friends , and her gifts that her sister was stealing from her . She had to kill Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in her bed , wide awake . When she was sure the household was asleep , she went over to Alexandra 's bed and awakened her . " Alex , " she whispered , " let 's go down to the kitchen and see our birthday cakes . " Alexandra said sleepily , " Everybody 's sleeping . " " We wo n't wake anyone up . " " Mademoiselle Dunas wo n't like it . Why do n't we look at the cakes in the morning ? " " Because I want to look at them now . Are you coming or not ? " Alexandra rubbed the sleep out of her eyes . She had no interest in seeing the birthday cakes , but she did not want to hurt her sister 's feelings . " I 'm coming , " she said . Alexandra got out of bed and put on a pair of slippers . Both girls wore pink nylon nightgowns . " Come on , " Eve said . " And do n't make any noise . " " I wo n't , " Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long corridor , past the closed door of Mademoiselle Dunas 's bedroom , down the steep back stairs that led to the kitchen . It was an enormous kitchen , with two large gas stoves , six ovens , three refrigerators and a walk-in freezer . In the refrigerator Eve found the birthday cakes that the cook ,  | Mrs. Tyler , had made . One of them said Happy Birthday , Alexandra . The other said Happy Birthday , Eve . Next year , Eve thought happily , there will only be one . Eve took Alexandra 's cake out of the refrigerator and placed it on the wooden chopping block in the middle of the kitchen . She opened a drawer and took out d package of brightly colored candles . " What are you doing ? " Alexandra asked . " I want to see how it looks with the candles all lighted . " Eve began pressing the candles into the icing of the cake . " I do n't think you should do that , Eve . You 'll ruin the cake . Mrs. Tyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . " Eve opened another drawer and took out two large boxes of kitchen matches . " Come on , help me . " " I want to go back to bed . " Eve turned on her angrily . " All right . Go back to bed , scaredy cat . I 'll do it alone . " Alexandra hesitated . " What do you want me to do ? " Eve handed her one of the boxes of matches . " Start lighting the candles . " Alexandra was afraid of fire . Both girls had been warned again and again about the danger of playing with matches . They knew the horror stories about children who had disobeyed that rule . But Alexandra did not want to disappoint Eve , and so she obediently began lighting the candles . Eve watched her a moment . " You 're leaving out the ones on the other side , silly , " she said . Alexandra leaned over to reach the candles at the far side of the cake , her back to Eve . Quickly , Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box she was holding . As they burst into flames , Eve dropped the box at Alexandra 's feet , so that the bottom of Alexandra 's nightgown caught fire . It was an instant before Alexandra was aware of what was happening . When she felt the first agonizing pain against her legs , she looked down and screamed , " Help ! Help me ! " Eve stared at the flaming nightgown a moment , awed by the  | extent of her success . Alexandra was standing there , petrified , frozen with fear . " Do n't move ! " Eve said . " I 'll get a bucket of water . " She hurried off to the butler 's pantry , her heart pounding with a fearful joy . It was a horror movie that saved Alexandra 's life . Mrs. Tyler , the Blackwells ' cook , had been escorted to the cinema by a police sergeant whose bed she shared from time to time . On this particular evening , the motion-picture screen was so filled with dead and mutilated bodies that finally Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a beheading , she said , " This may all be in a day 's work for you , Richard , but I 've had enough . " Sergeant Richard Dougherty reluctantly followed her out of the theater . They arrived back at the Blackwell mansion an hour earlier than they had expected to , and as Mrs. Tyler opened the back door , she heard Alexandra 's screams coming from the kitchen . Mrs. Tyler and Sergeant Dougherty rushed in , took one horrified look at the scene before them and went into action . The sergeant leaped at Alexandra and ripped off her flaming nightgown . Her legs and hips were blistered , but the flames had not reached her hair or the front of her body . Alexandra fell to the floor , unconscious . Mrs. Tyler filled a large pot with water and poured it over the flames licking at the floor . " Call an ambulance , " Sergeant Dougherty ordered . " Is Mrs. Blackwell home ? " " She should be upstairs asleep . " " Wake her up . " As Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry from the butler 's pantry , and Eve ran in carrying a pan of water , sobbing hysterically . " Is Alexandra dead ? " Eve screamed . " Is she dead ? " Mrs. Tyler took Eve in her arms to soothe her . " No , darling , she 's all right . She 's going to be just fine . " " It was my fault , " Eve sobbed . " She wanted to light the candles on her birthday cake . I should n't have let her do it . "  | Mrs. Tyler stroked Eve 's back . " It 's all right . You must n't blame yourself . " " The m-matches fell out of my hand , al:0 Alex caught on fire . It was t-terrible . " Sergeant Dougherty looked at Eve and said sympathetically , " Poor child . " " Alexandra has second-degree burns on her legs and back , " Dr. Harley told Kate , " but she 's going to be fine . We can do amazing things with burns these days . Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Kate said . She had seen Alexandra 's burns , and they had filled her with horror . She hesitated a moment . " John , I think I 'm even more concerned about Eve . " " Was Eve hurt ? " " Not physically , but the poor child blames herself for the accident . She 's having terrible nightmares . The last three nights I 've had to go in and hold her in my arms before she could go back to sleep . I do n't want this to become more traumatic . Eve is very sensitive . " " Kids get over things pretty quickly , Kate . If there 's any problem , let me know , and I 'll recommend a child therapist . " , " Thank you , " Kate said gratefully . Eve was terribly upset . The birthday party had been canceled . Alexandra cheated me out of that , Eve thought bitterly . Alexandra healed perfectly , with no signs of scars . Eve got over her feelings of guilt with remarkable ease . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . You must n't blame yourself . " Eve did n't . She blamed Mrs. Tyler . Why did she have to come home and spoil everything ? It had been a perfect plan . The sanitarium where Tony was confined was in a peaceful , wooded area in Connecticut . Kate was driven out to see him once a month . The lobotomy had been successful . There was no longer the slightest sign of aggression in Tony . He recognized  | Kate and he always politely asked about Eve and Alexandra , but he showed no interest in seeing them . He showed very little interest in anything . He seemed happy . No , not happy , Kate corrected herself . Content . But content  --  to do what ? Kate asked Mr. Burger , the superintendent of the asylum , " Does n't my son do anything all day ? " " Oh , yes , Mrs. Blackwell . He sits by the hour and paints . " Her son , who could have owned the world , sat and painted all day . Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind gone forever . " What does he paint ? " The man was embarrassed . " No one can quite figure it out . "  | During the next two years , Kate became seriously concerned about Alexandra . The child was definitely accident-prone . During Eve and Alexandra 's summer vacation at the Blackwell estate in the Bahamas , Alexandra almost drowned while playing with Eve in the pool , and it was only the prompt intervention of a gardener that saved her . The following year when the two girls were on a picnic in the Palisades , Alexandra somehow slipped off the edge of a cliff and saved herself by clinging to a shrub growing out of the steep mountainside . " I wish you would keep a closer eye on your sister , " Kate told Eve . " She ca n't seem to take care of herself the way you can . " " I know , " Eve said solemnly . " I 'll watch her , Gran . " Kate loved both her granddaughters , but in different ways . They were seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft blond hair , exquisite features and the McGregor eyes . They looked alike , but their personalities were quite different . Alexandra 's gentleness reminded Kate of Tony , while Eve was more like her , headstrong and self-sufficient . A chauffeur drove them to school in the family Rolls-Royce . Alexandra was embarrassed to have her classmates see her with  | the car and chauffeur ; Eve reveled in it . Kate gave each girl a weekly allowance , and ordered them to keep a record of how they spent it . Eve invariably ran short of money before the week was out and borrowed from Alexandra . Eve learned to adjust the books so that Gran would not know . But Kate knew , and she could hardly hold back her smile . Seven years old and already a creative accountant ! In the beginning , Kate had nurtured a secret dream that one day Tony would be well again , that he would leave the asylum and return to Kruger-Brent . But as time passed , the dream slowly faded . It was tacitly understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a male nurse , he would never again be able to participate in the outside world . It was 1962 , and as Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , prospered and expanded , the demands for new leadership grew more urgent . Kate celebrated her seventieth birthday . Her hair was white now , and she was a remarkable figure of a woman , strong and erect and vital . She was aware that the attrition of time would overtake her . She had to be prepared . The company had to be safeguarded for the family . Brad Rogers was a good manager , but he was not a Blackwell . I have to last until the twins can take over . She thought of Cecil Rhodes 's last words : " So little done  --  so much to do . " The twins were twelve years old , on the verge of becoming young ladies . Kate had spent as much time with them as she possibly could , but now she turned even more of her attention to them . It was time to make an important decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dark Harbor in a company plane . The girls had visited all the family estates except the one in Johannesburg , and of them all , Dark Harbor was their favorite . They enjoyed the wild freedom and the seclusion of the island . They loved to sail and swim and water-ski. and Dark Harbor held all these things for them . Eve asked if she could bring some schoolmates along , as she had in the past , but this time her grandmother refused . Grandmother , that powerful , imposing figure who swept in and out , dropping off a pres-  | ent here , a kiss on the cheek there , with occasional admonitions about how young ladies behaved , wanted to be alone with them . This time the girls sensed that something different was happening . Their grandmother was with them at every meal . She took them boating and swimming and even riding . Kate handled her horse with the sureness of an expert . The girls still looked amazingly alike , two golden beauties , but Kate was interested less in their similarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they finished a tennis game , Kate summed them up in her mind . Eve was the leader , Alexandra the follower . Eve had a stubborn streak . Alexandra was flexible . Eve was a natural athlete . Alexandra was still having accidents . Only a few days before , when the two girls were out alone in a small sailboat with Eve at the rudder , the wind had come behind the sail and the sail had luffed , swinging it crashing toward Alexandra 's head . She had not gotten out of the way in time and had been swept overboard and nearly drowned . Another boat nearby had assisted Eve in rescuing her sister . Kate wondered whether all these things could have anything to do with Alexandra having been born three minutes later than Eve , but the reasons did not matter . Kate had made her decision . There was no longer any question in her mind . She was putting her money on Eve , and it was a ten-billion-dollar bet . She would find a perfect consort for Eve , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alexandra , she would have a life of wealth and comfort . She might be very good working on the charitable grants Kate had set up . Yes , that would be perfect for Alexandra . She was such a sweet and compassionate child . The first step toward implementing Kate 's plan was to see that Eve got into the proper school . Kate chose Briarcrest , an excellent school in South Carolina . " Both my granddaughters are delightful , " Kate informed Mrs. Chandler , the headmistress . " But you 'll find that Eve is the clever one . She 's an extraordinary girl , and I 'm sure you 'll see to it that she has every advantage here . "  | " All our students have every advantage here , Mrs. Blackwell . You spoke of Eve . What about her sister ? " " Alexandra ? A lovely girl . " It was a pejorative . Kate stood up . " I shall be checking their progress regularly . " In some odd way , the headmistress felt the words were a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve . She enjoyed the freedom of being away from home , of not having to account to her grandmother and Solange Dunas . The rules at Briarcrest were strict , but that did not bother Eve , for she was adept at getting around rules . The only thing that disturbed her was that Alexandra was there with her . When Eve first heard the news about Briarcrest , she begged , " May I go alone ? Please , Gran ? " And Kate said , " No , darling . I think it 's better if Alexandra goes with you . " Eve concealed her resentment . " Whatever you say , Gran . " She was always very polite and affectionate around her grandmother . Eve knew where the power lay . Their father was a crazy man , locked up in an insane asylum . Their mother was dead . It was their grandmother who controlled the money . Eve knew they were rich . She had no idea how much money there was , but it was a lot  --  enough to buy all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was only one problem : Alexandra . One of the twins ' favorite activities at Briarcrest School was the morning riding class . Most of the girls owned their own jumpers , and Kate had given each twin one for her twelfth birthday . Jerome Davis , the riding instructor , watched as his pupils went through their paces in the ring , jumping over a onefoot stile , then a two-foot stile and finally a four-foot stile . Davis was one of the best riding teachers in the country . Several of his former pupils had gone on to win gold medals , and he was adept at spotting a natural-born rider . The new girl , Eve Blackwell , was a natural . She did not have to think about what she was  | doing , how to hold the reins or post in the saddle . She and her horse were one , and as they sailed over the hurdles , Eve 's golden hair flying in the wind , it was a beautiful sight to behold . Nothing 's going to stop that one , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra . Mr. Davis watched Alexandra saddle up her horse , preparing for her turn . Alexandra and Eve wore different-colored ribbons on their sleeves so he could tell them apart . Eve was helping Alexandra saddle her horse while Tommy was busy with another student . Davis was summoned to the main building for a telephone call , and what happened after that was a matter of great confusion . From what Jerome Davis was able to piece together later , Alexandra mounted her horse , circled the ring and started toward the first low jump . Her horse inexplicably began rearing and bucking , and threw Alexandra into a wall . She was knocked unconscious , and it was only by inches that the wild horse 's hooves missed her face . Tommy carried Alexandra to the infirmary , where the school doctor diagnosed a mild concussion . " Nothing broken , nothing serious , " he said . " By tomorrow morning , she 'll be right as rain , ready to get up on her horse again . " " But she could have been killed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Mrs. Chandler thought she had never seen such devotion in a sister . It was truly touching . When Mr. Davis was finally able to corral Alexandra 's horse to unsaddle it , he found the saddle blanket stained with blood . He lifted it off and discovered a large piece of jagged metal from a beer can still protruding from the horse 's back , where it had been pressed down by the saddle . When he reported this to Mrs. Chandler , she started an immediate investigation . All the girls who had been in the vicinity of the stable were questioned . " I 'm sure , " Mrs. Chandler said , " that whoever put that piece of metal there thought she was playing a harmless prank , but it could have led to very serious consequences . I want the name of the girl who did it . "  | When no one volunteered , Mrs. Chandler talked to them in her office , one by one . Each girl denied any knowledge of what had happened . When it was Eve 's turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you have any idea who could have done this to your sister ? " Mrs. Chandler asked . Eve looked down at the rug . " I 'd rather not say , " she mumbled . " Then you did see something ? " " Please , Mrs. Chandler ... " " Eve , Alexandra could have been seriously hurt . The girl who did this must be punished so that it does not happen again . " " It was n't one of the girls . " " What do you mean ? " " It was Tommy . " " The groom ? " " Yes , ma'am . I saw him . I thought he was just tightening the cinch . I 'm sure he did n't mean any harm . Alexandra orders him around a lot , and I guess he wanted to teach her a lesson . Oh , Mrs. Chandler , I wish you had n't made me tell you . I do n't want to get anyone in trouble . " The poor child was on the verge of hysteria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her . " It 's all right , Eve . You did right to tell me . Now you just forget about everything . I 'll take care of it . " The following morning when the girls went out to the stables , there was a new groom . A few months later , there was another unpleasant incident at the school . Several of the girls had been caught smoking marijuana and one of them accused Eve of supplying it and selling it . Eve angrily denied it . A search by Mrs. Chandler revealed marijuana hidden in Alexandra 's locker . " I do n't believe she did it , " Eve said stoutly . " Someone put it there . I know it . " An account of the incident was sent to Kate by the headmis-  | tress , and Kate admired Eve 's loyalty in shielding her sister . She was a McGregor , all right . On the twins ' fifteenth birthday , Kate took them to the estate in South Carolina , where she gave a large party for them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exposed to the proper young men , and every eligible young man around was invited to the girls ' party . The boys were at the awkward age where they were not yet seriously interested in girls , but Kate made it her business to see that acquaintances were made and friendships formed . Somewhere among these young boys could be the man in Eve 's future , the future of Kruger-Brent , Ltd . Alexandra did not enjoy parties , but she always pretended she was having a good time in order not to disappoint her grandmother . Eve adored parties . She loved dressing up , being admired . Alexandra preferred reading and painting . She spent hours looking at her father 's paintings at Dark Harbor , and she wished she could have known him before he became ill . He appeared at the house on holidays with his male companion , but Alexandra found it impossible to reach her father . He was a pleasant , amiable stranger who wanted to please , but had nothing to say . Their grandfather , Frederick Hoffman , lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him . In her second year at school , Eve became pregnant . For several weeks she had been pale and listless and had missed some morning classes . When she began to have frequent periods of nausea , she was sent to the infirmary and examined . Mrs. Chandler had been hastily summoned . " Eve is pregnant , " the doctor told her . " But  --  that 's impossible ! How could it have happened ? " The doctor replied mildly , " In the usual fashion , I would presume . " " But she 's just a child . " " Well , this child is going to be a mother . "  | Eve bravely refused to talk . " I do n't want to get anyone in trouble , " she kept saying . It was the kind of answer Mrs. Chandler expected from Eve . " Eve , dear , you must tell me what happened . " And so at last Eve broke down . " I was raped , " she said , and burst into tears . Mrs. Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and demanded , " Who was it ? " " Mr. Parkinson . " Her English teacher . If it had been anyone else but Eve , Mrs. Chandler would not have believed it . Joseph Parkinson was a quiet man with a wife and three children . He had taught at Briarcrest School for eight years , and he was the last one Mrs. Chandler would have ever suspected . She called him into her office , and she knew instantly that Eve had told the truth . He sat facing her , his face twitching with nervousness . " You know why I 've sent for you , Mr. Parkinson ? " " I  --  I think so . " " It concerns Eve . " " Yes . I  --  I guessed that . " " She says you raped her . " Parkinson looked at her in disbelief . " Raped her ? My God ! If anyone was raped , it was me . " In his excitement he lapsed into the ungrammatical . Mrs. Chandler said contemptuously , " Do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's not a child . " His voice was venomous . " She 's a devil . " He wiped the perspiration from his brow . " All semester she sat in the front row of my class , with her dress hiked up . After class she would come up and ask a lot of meaningless questions while she rubbed herself against me . I did n't take her seriously . Then one afternoon about six weeks ago she came over to my house when my wife and children were away and ? " His voice broke . " Oh , Jesus ! I could n't help it . " He burst into tears . They brought Eve into the office . Her manner was composed . She looked into Mr. Parkinson 's eyes , and it was he who turned  | away first . In the office were Mrs. Chandler , the assistant principal and the chief of police of the small town where the school was located . The chief of police said gently , " Do you want to tell us what happened , Eve ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calm . " Mr. Parkinson said he wanted to discuss my English work with me . He asked me to come to his house on a Sunday afternoon . He was alone in the house . He said he wanted to show me something in the bedroom , so I followed him upstairs . He forced me onto the bed , and he ? " " It 's a lie ! " Parkinson yelled . " That 's not the way it happened . That 's not the way it happened ... " Kate was sent for , and the situation was explained to her . It was decided that it was in everyone 's interest to keep the incident quiet . Mr. Parkinson was dismissed from the school and given forty-eight hours to leave the state . An abortion was discreetly arranged for Eve . Kate quietly bought up the school mortgage , carried by a local bank , and foreclosed . When Eve heard the news , she sighed , " I 'm so sorry , Gran . I really liked that school . " A few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandra were registered at L'Institut Fernwood , a Swiss finishing school near Lausanne .  | There was a fire burning in Eve that was so fierce she could not put it out . It was not sex alone : That was only a small part of it . It was a rage to live , a need to do everything , be everything . Life was a lover , and Eve was desperate to possess it with all she had in her . She was jealous of everyone . She went to the ballet and hated the ballerina because she herself was not up there dancing and winning the cheers of the audience . She wanted to be a scientist , a singer , a surgeon , a pilot , an actress . She wanted to do everything , and do it better than anyone else had ever done it . She wanted it all , and she could not wait . Across the valley from L'Institut Fernwood was a boys ' military school . By the time Eve was seventeen , nearly every student and almost half the instructors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs indiscriminately , but this time she took proper precautions , for she had no intention of ever getting pregnant again . She enjoyed sex , but it was not the act itself Eve loved , it was the power it gave her . She was the one in control . She gloated over the pleading looks of the boys and men who wanted to take her to bed and make love to her . She enjoyed teasing them and watching their hunger grow . She en-  | joyed the lying promises they made in order to possess her . But most of all , Eve enjoyed the power she had over their bodies . She could bring them to an erection with a kiss , and wither them with a word . She did not need them , they needed her . She controlled them totally , and it was a tremendous feeling . Within minutes she could measure a man 's strengths and weaknesses . She decided men were fools , all of them . Eve was beautiful and intelligent and an heiress to one of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen serious proposals of marriage . She was not interested . The only boys who attracted her were the ones Alexandra liked . At a Saturday-night school dance , Alexandra met an attentive young French student named Rene Mallot . He was not handsome , but he was intelligent and sensitive , and Alexandra thought he was wonderful . They arranged to meet in town the following Saturday . " Seven o'clock , " Rene said . " I 'll be waiting . " In their room that night , Alexandra told Eve about her new friend . " He 's not like the other boys . He 's rather shy and sweet . We 're going to the theater Saturday . " " You like him a lot , do n't you , little sister ? " Eve teased . Alexandra blushed . " I just met him , but he seems ? Well , you k now . " Eve lay back on her bed , hands clasped behind her head . " No , I do n't know . Tell me . Did he try to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of boy at all . I told you . . . he 's  --  he 's s y . " Well , well . My little sister 's in love . " " Of course I 'm not ! Now I wish I had n't told you . " " I 'm glad you did , " Eve said sincerely . When Alexandra arrived in front of the theater the following Saturday , Rene was nowhere in sight . Alexandra waited on the street corner for more than an hour , ignoring the stares of passers-by , feeling like a fool . Finally she had a bad dinner alone in a small cafe and returned to school , miserable . Eve was not in their room . Alexandra read until curfew and then turned out the  | lights . It was almost two A.M. when Alexandra heard Eve sneak into the room . " I was getting worried about you , " Alexandra whispered . " I ran into some old friends . How was your evening  --  di-vine ? " " It was dreadful . He never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , " Eve said sympathetically . " But you must learn never to trust a man . " " You do n't think anything could have happened to him ? " " No , Alex . I think he probably found somebody he liked better . " Of course he did , Alexandra thought . She was not really surprised . She had no idea how beautiful she was , or how admirable . She had lived all her life in the shadow of her twin sister . She adored her , and it seemed only right to Alexandra that everyone should be attracted to Eve . She felt inferior to Eve , but it never occurred to her that her sister had been carefully nourishing that feeling since they were children . There were other broken dates . Boys Alexandra liked would seem to respond to her , and then she would never see them again . One weekend she ran into Rene unexpectedly on the streets of Lausanne . He hurried up to her and said , " What happened ? You promised you would call me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He stepped back , suddenly wary . " Eve . . . ? " " No , Alexandra . " His face flushed . " I  --  I 'm sorry . I have to go . " And he hurried away , leaving her staring after him in confusion . That evening when Alexandra told Eve about the incident , Eve shrugged and said , " He 's obviously fou . You 're much better off without him , Alex . " In spite of her feeling of expertise about men , there was one male weakness of which Eve was unaware , and it almost proved to be her undoing . From the beginning of time , men have boasted of their conquests , and the students at the military  | school were no different . They discussed Eve Blackwell with admiration and awe . " When she was through with me , I could n't move ... " " I never thought I 'd have a piece of ass like that ... " " She 's got a pussy that talks to you ... " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since at least two dozen boys and half a dozen teachers were praising Eve 's libidinous talents , it soon became the school 's worst-kept secret . One of the instructors at the military school mentioned the gossip to a teacher at L'Institut Fernwood , and she in turn reported it to Mrs. Collins , the headmistress . A discreet investigation was begun , and the result was a meeting between the headmistress and Eve . " I think it would be better for the reputation of this school if you left immediately . " Eve stared at Mrs. Collins as though the lady were demented . " What on earth are you talking about ? " " I 'm talking about the fact that you have been servicing half the military academy . The other half seems to be lined up , eagerly waiting . " " I 've never heard such terrible lies in my whole life . " Eve 's voice was quivering with indignation . " Do n't think I 'm not going to report this to my grandmother . When she hears ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would prefer to avoid embarrassment to L'Institut Fernwood , but if you do not leave quietly , I have a list of names I intend to send to your grandmother . " " I 'd like to see that list ! " Mrs. Collins handed it to Eve without a word . It was a long list . Eve studied it and noted that at least seven names were missing . She sat there , quietly thinking . Finally she looked up and said imperiously , " This is obviously some kind of plot against my family . Someone is trying to embarrass my grandmother through me . Rather than let that happen , I will leave . " " A very wise decision , " Mrs. Collins said dryly . " A car will drive you to the airport in the morning . I 'll cable your  | grandmother that you 're coming home . You 're dismissed . " Eve turned and started for the door , then suddenly thought of something . " What about my sister ? " " Alexandra may remain here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , she found Eve packing . " What are you doing ? " " I 'm going home . " " Home ? In the middle of the term ? " Eve turned to face her sister . " Alex , do n't you really have any idea what a waste this school is ? We 're not learning anything here . We 're just killing time . " Alexandra was listening in surprise . " I had no idea you felt that way , Eve . " " I 've felt like this every damn day for the whole bloody year . The only reason I stuck it out was because of you . You seemed to be enjoying it so much . " " I am , but ? " " I 'm sorry , Alex . I just ca n't take it any longer . I want to get back to New York . I want to go home where we belong . " " Have you told Mrs. Collins ? " " A few minutes ago . " " How did she take it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was miserable ? afraid it would make her school look bad . She begged me to stay . " Alexandra sat down on the edge of the bed . " I do n't know what to say . " " You do n't have to say anything . This has nothing to do with you . " " Of course it has . If you 're that unhappy here ? " She stopped . " You 're probably right . It is a bloody waste of time . Who needs to conjugate Latin verbs ? " " Right . Or who gives a fig about Hannibal or his bloody brother , Hasdrubal ? " Alexandra walked over to the closet , took out her suitcase and put it on the bed .  | Eve smiled . " I was n't going to ask you to leave here , Alex , but I 'm really glad we 're going home together . " Alexandra pressed her sister 's hand . " So am I. " Eve said casually , " Tell you what . While I finish packing , call Gran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . Tell her we ca n't stand this place . Will you do that ? " " Yes . " Alexandra hesitated . " I do n't think she 's going to like it . " " Do n't worry about the old lady , " Eve said confidently . " I can handle her . " And Alexandra had no reason to doubt it . Eve was able to make Gran do pretty much what she wanted . But then , Alexandra thought , how could anyone refuse Eve anything ? She went to make the phone call . Kate Blackwell had friends and enemies and business associates in high places , and for the last few months disturbing rumors had been coming to her ears . In the beginning she had ignored them as petty jealousies . But they persisted . Eve was seeing too much of the boys at a military school in Switzerland . Eve had an abortion . Eve was being treated for a social disease . Thus , it was with a degree of relief that Kate learned that her granddaughters were coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile rumors . The day the girls arrived , Kate was at home waiting for them . She took Eve into the sitting room off her bedroom . " I 've been hearing some distressing stories , " she said . " I want to know why you were thrown out of school . " Her eyes bored into those of her granddaughter . " We were n't thrown out , " Eve replied . " Alex and I decided to leave . " " Because of some incidents with boys ? " Eve said , " Please , Grandmother . I 'd rather not talk about it . " " I 'm afraid you 're going to have to . What have you been doing ? "  | " I have n't been doing anything . It is Alex who ? " She broke off . " Alex who what ? " Kate was relentless . " Please do n't blame her , " Eve said quickly . " I 'm sure she could n't help it . She likes to play this childish game of pretending to be me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the girls started gossiping about it . It seems she was seeing a lot of  --  of boys ? " Eve broke off in embarrassment . " Pretending to be you ? " Kate was stunned . " Why did n't you put a stop to it ? " " I tried , " Eve said miserably . " She threatened to kill herself . Oh , Gran , I think Alexandra is a bit " ? she forced herself to say the word ? " unstable . If you even discuss any of this with her , I 'm afraid of what she might do . " There was naked agony in the child 's tear-filled eyes . Kate 's heart felt heavy at Eve 's deep unhappiness . " Eve , do n't . Do n't cry , darling . I wo n't say anything to Alexandra . This will be just between the two of us . " " I  --  I did n't want you to know . Oh , Gran , " she sobbed , " I knew how much it would hurt you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's beautiful outside and rotten inside , Kate thought . It was bad enough that Alexandra was involved in a series of sordid affairs , but to try to put the blame on her sister ! Kate was appalled . During the next two years , while Eve and Alexandra finished school at Miss Porter 's , Eve was very discreet . She had been frightened by the close call . Nothing must jeopardize the relationship with her grandmother . The old lady could not last much longer  --  she was seventy-nine ! ? and Eve intended to make sure that she was Gran 's heiress . For the girls ' twenty-first birthday , Kate took her granddaughters to Paris and bought them new wardrobes at Coco Chanel . At a small dinner party at Le Petit Bedouin , Eve and  | Alexandra met Count Alfred Maurier and his wife , the Countess Vivien . The count was a distinguished-looking man in his fifties , with iron-gray hair and the disciplined body of an athlete . His wife was a pleasant-looking woman with a reputation as an international hostess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , except for a remark she overheard someone make to the countess . " I envy you and Alfred . You 're the happiest married couple I know . How many years have you been married ? Twenty-five ? " " It will be twenty-six next month , " Alfred replied for her . " And I may be the only Frenchman in history who has never been unfaithful to his wife . " Everyone laughed except Eve . During the rest of the dinner , she studied Count Maurier and his wife . Eve could not imagine what the count saw in that flabby , middle-aged woman with her crepey neck . Count Maurier had probably never known what real lovemaking was . That boast of his was stupid . Count Alfred Maurier was a challenge . The following day , Eve telephoned Maurier at his office . " This is Eve Blackwell . You probably do n't remember me , but ? " " How could I forget you , child ? You are one of the beautiful granddaughters of my friend Kate . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing you , but I was told you 're an expert on wines . I 'm planning a surprise dinner party for Grandmother . " She gave a rueful little laugh . " I know what I want to serve , but I do n't know a thing about wines . I wondered whether you 'd be kind enough to advise me . " " I would be delighted , " he said , flattered . " It depends on what you are serving . If you are starting with a fish , a nice , light Chablis would be ? " " Oh , I 'm afraid I could never remember all this . Would it be possible for me to see you so that we could discuss it ? If you 're free for lunch today . . . ? " " For an old friend , I can arrange that . "  | " Oh , good . " Eve replaced the receiver slowly . It would be a lunch the count would remember the rest of his life . They met at Lasserre . The discussion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse impatiently , and then interrupted . " I 'm in love with you , Alfred . " The count stopped dead in the middle of a sentence . " I beg your pardon ? " " I said I 'm in love with you . " He took a sip of wine . " A vintage year . " He patted Eve 's hand and smiled . " All good friends should love one another . " " I 'm not talking about that kind of love , Alfred . " And the count looked into Eve 's eyes and knew exactly what kind of love she was talking about . It made him decidedly nervous . This girl was twenty-one years old , and he was past middle age , a happily married man . He simply could not understand what got into young girls these days . He felt uneasy sitting across from her , listening to what she was saying , and he felt even uneasier because she was probably the most beautiful , desirable young woman he had ever seen . She was wearing a beige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of a full , rich bosom . She was not wearing a brassiere , and he could see the thrust of her nipples . He looked at her innocent young face , and he was at a loss for words . " You  --  you do n't even know me . " " I 've dreamed about you from the time I was a little girl . I imagined a man in shining armor who was tall and handsome and ? " " I 'm afraid my armor 's a little rusty . I ? " " Please do n't make fun of me , " Eve begged . " When I saw you at dinner last night , I could n't take my eyes off you . I have n't been able to think of anything else . I have n't slept . I have n't been able to get you out of my mind for a moment . " Which was almost true . " I  --  I do n't know what to say to you , Eve . I am a happily married man . I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I envy your wife ! She 's the luckiest  | woman in the world . I wonder if she realizes that , Alfred . " " Of course she does . I tell her all the time . " He smiled nervously , and wondered how to change the subject . " Does she really appreciate you ? Does she know how sensitive you are ? Does she worry about your happiness ? I would . " The count was becoming increasingly uncomfortable . " You 're a beautiful young woman , " he said . " And one day you 're going to find your knight in shining , unrusted armor , and then ? " " I 've found him and I want to go to bed with him . " He looked around , afraid that someone might have overheard . " Eve ! Please ! " She leaned forward . " That 's all I ask . The memory will last me for the rest of my life . " The count said firmly , " This is impossible . You are placing me in a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers . " Slowly , Eve 's eyes filled with tears . " Is that what you think of me ? That I go around  --  I 've known only one man in my life . We were engaged to be married . " She did not bother to brush the tears away . " He was kind and loving and gentle . He was killed in a mountain-climbing accident . I saw it happen . It was awful . " Count Maurier put his hand over hers . " I am so sorry . " " You remind me so much of him . When I saw you , it was as though Bill had returned to me . If you would give me just one hour , I would never bother you again . You 'd never even have to see me again . Please , Alfred ! " The count looked at Eve for a long time , weighing his decision . After all , he was French . They spent the afternoon in a small hotel on Rue SainteAnne . In all his experience before his marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a hurricane , a nymphet , a devil . She knew too much . By the end of the afternoon , Count Maurier was completely exhausted .  | As they were getting dressed , Eve said , " When will I see you again , darling ? " " I 'll telephone you , " Maurier said . He did not plan ever to see this woman again . There was something about her that was frightening  --  almost evil . She was what the Americans so appropriately called bad news , and he had no intention of becoming involved further with her . The matter would have ended there , had they not been seen coming out of the hotel together by Alicia Vanderlake , who had served on a charity committee with Kate Blackwell the previous year . Mrs. Vanderlake was a social climber , and this was a heaven-sent ladder . She had seen newspaper photographs of Count Maurier and his wife , and she had seen photographs of the Blackwell twins . She was not sure which twin this was , but that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked in her private telephone book and found Kate Blackwell 's number . The butler answered the telephone . " Bonjour . " " I would like to speak with Mrs. Blackwell , please . " " May I tell her who is calling ? " " Mrs. Vanderlake . It 's a personal matter . " A minute later , Kate Blackwell was on the phone . " Who is this ? " " This is Alicia Vanderlake , Mrs. Blackwell . I 'm sure you 'll remember me . We served on a committee together last year and ? " " If it 's for a donation , call my ? " " No , no , " Mrs. Vanderlake said hastily . " It 's personal . It 's about your granddaughter . " Kate Blackwell would invite her over to tea , and they would discuss it , woman to woman . It would be the beginning of a warm friendship . Kate Blackwell said , " What about her ? " Mrs. Vanderlake had had no intention of discussing the matter over the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I thought it my duty to tell you that a few  | minutes ago I saw her sneaking out of a hotel with Count Alfred Maurier . It was an obvious assignation . " Kate 's voice was icy . " I find this difficult to believe . Which one of my granddaughters ? " Mrs. Vanderlake gave an uncertain laugh . " I  --  I do n't know . I ca n't tell them apart . But then , no one can , can they ? It ? " " Thank you for the information . " And Kate hung up . She stood there digesting the information she had just heard . Only the evening before they had dined together . Kate had known Alfred Maurier for fifteen years , and what she had just been told was entirely out of character for him , unthinkable . And yet , men were susceptible . If Alexandra had set out to lure Alfred into bed .. . Kate picked up the telephone and said to the operator , " I wish to place a call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned home late that afternoon , she was flushed with satisfaction , not because she had enjoyed sex with Count Maurier , but because of her victory over him . If I can have him so easily , Eve thought , I can have anyone . I can own the world . She walked into the library and found Kate there . " Hello , Gran . Did you have a lovely day ? " Kate stood there studying her lovely young granddaughter . " Not a very good one , I 'm afraid . What about you ? " " Oh , I did a little shopping . I did n't see anything more I really wanted . You bought me everything . You always ? " " Close the door , Eve . " Something in Kate 's voice sent out a warning signal . Eve closed the large oak door . " Sit down . " " Is something wrong , Gran ? " " That 's what you 're going to tell me . I was going to invite Alfred Maurier here , but I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to spin . This was impossible ! There was no  | way anyone could have found out about her and Alfred Maurier . She had left him only an hour earlier . " I  --  I do n't understand what you 're talking about . " " Then let me put it bluntly . You were in bed this afternoon with Count Maurier . " Tears sprang to Eve 's eyes . " I  --  I was hoping you 'd never find out what he did to me , because he 's your friend . " She fought to keep her voice steady . " It was terrible . He telephoned and invited me to lunch and got me drunk and ? " " Shut up ! " Kate 's voice was like a whiplash . Her eyes were filled with loathing . " You 're despicable . " Kate had spent the most painful hour of her life , coming to a realization of the truth about her granddaughter . She could hear again the voice of the headmistress saying , Mrs. Blackwell , young women will be young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , it is none of my business . But Eve was so blatantly promiscuous that for the good of the school .. . And Eve had blamed Alexandra . Kate started to remember the accidents . The fire , when Alexandra almost burned to death . Alexandra 's fall from the cliff . Alexandra being knocked out of the boat Eve was sailing , and almost drowning . Kate could hear Eve 's voice recounting the details of her " rape " by her English teacher : Mr. Parkinson said he wanted to discuss my English work with me . He asked me to come to his house on a Sunday afternoon . When I got there , he was alone in the house . He said he wanted to show me something in the bedroom . I followed him upstairs . He forced me onto the bed , and he .. . Kate remembered the incident at Briarcrest when Eve was accused of selling marijuana and the blame had been put on Alexandra . Eve had not blamed Alexandra , she had defended her . That was Eve 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , she was clever . Now Kate studied the beautiful , angel-faced monster in front of her . I built all my future plans around you . It was you who war going to take control of Kruger-Brent one day . It was you I loved  | and cherished . Kate said , " I want you to leave this house . I never want to see you again . " Eve had gone very pale . " You 're a whore . I think I could live with that . But you 're also deceitful and cunning and a psychopathic liar . I can not live with that . " It was all happening too fast . Eve said desperately , " Gran , if Alexandra has been telling you lies about me ? " " Alexandra does n't know anything about this . I just had a long talk with Mrs. Collins . " " Is that all ? " Eve forced a note of relief in her voice . " Mrs. Collins hates me because ? " Kate was filled with a sudden weariness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's over . I 've sent for my lawyer . I 'm disinheriting you . " Eve felt her world crumbling around her . " You ca n't . How ? how will I live ? " " You will be given a small allowance . From now on , you will live your own life . Do anything you please . " Kate 's voice hardened . " But if I ever hear or read one word of scandal about you , if you ever disgrace the Blackwell name in any way , your allowance will stop forever . Is that clear ? " Eve looked into her grandmother 's eyes and knew this time there would be no reprieve . A dozen excuses sprang to her lips , but they died there . Kate rose to her feet and said in an unsteady voice , " I do n't suppose this will mean anything to you , but this is  --  this is the most difficult thing I 've ever had to do in my life . " And Kate turned and walked out of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened bedroom alone , wondering why everything had gone wrong . If David had not been killed , and Tony could have known his father .. . If Tony had not wanted to be an artist .. .  | If Marianne had lived .. . If A two-letter word for futility . The future was clay , to be molded day by day , but the past was bedrock , immutable . Everyone I 've loved has betrayed me , Kate thought . Tony . Marianne . Eve . Sartre said it well : " Hell is other people . " She wondered when the pain would go away . If Kate was filled with pain , Eve was filled with fury . All she had done was to enjoy herself in bed for an hour or two , and her grandmother acted as though Eve had committed some unspeakable crime . The old-fashioned bitch ! No , not old-fashioned : senile . That was it . She was senile . Eve would find a good attorney and have the new will laughed out of court . Her father and grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Kruger-Brent was her company . How many times had her grandmother told her that one day it would belong to her . And Alexandra ! All this time Alexandra had been undermining her , whispering God-knows-what poison into their grandmother 's ears . Alexandra wanted the company for herself . The terrible part was that now she would probably get it . What had happened this afternoon was bad enough , but the thought of Alexandra gaining control was unbearable . I ca n't let that happen , Eve thought . I 'll find a way to stop her . She closed the snaps on her suitcase and went to find her sister . Alexandra was in the garden reading . She looked up as Eve approached . " Alex , I 've decided to go back to New York . " Alexandra looked at her sister in surprise . " Now ? Gran 's planning a cruise to the Dalmatian coast next week . You ? " " Who cares about the Dalmatian coast ? I 've been thinking a lot about this . It 's time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a big girl now . So I 'm going to find the most divine little apartment , and if you 're good , I 'll let you spend the night once in a while . " That 's just the right note , Eve thought . Friendly , but not gushy . Do n't let her know you 're on to her . Alexandra was studying her sister with concern . " Does Gran know ? " " I told her this afternoon . She hates the idea , of course , but  | she understands . I wanted to get a job , but she insisted on giving me an allowance . " Alexandra asked , " Would you like me to come with you ? " The goddamned , two-faced bitch ! First she forced her out of the house , and now she was pretending she wanted to go with her . Well , they 're not going to dispose of little Eve so easily . I 'll show them all . She would have her own apartment  --  she would find some fabulous decorator to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and go as she pleased . She could invite men up to her place and have them spend the night . She would be truly free for the first time in her life . It was an exhilarating thought . Now she said , " You 're sweet , Alex , but I 'd like to be on my own for a while . " Alexandra looked at her sister and felt a deep sense of loss . It would be the first time they had ever been parted . " We 'll see each other often , wo n't we ? " " Of course we will , " Eve promised . " More than you imagine . "  |  When Eve returned to New York , she checked into a midtown hotel , as she had been instructed . An hour later , Brad Rogers telephoned . " Your grandmother called from Paris , Eve . Apparently there 's some problem between you two . " " Not really , " Eve laughed . " It 's just a little family ? " She was about to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay in that direction . From now on , she would have to be very careful . She had never had to think about money . It had always been there . Now it loomed large in her thoughts . She had no idea how large her allowance was going to be and for the first time in her life Eve felt fear . " She told you she 's having a new will drawn up ? " Brad asked . " Yes , she mentioned something about it . " She was determined to play it cool . " I think we had better discuss this in person . How 's Monday at three ? " " That will be fine , Brad . " " My office . All right ? " " I 'll be there . "  | At five minutes before three , Eve entered the Kruger-Brent , Ltd. , Building . She was greeted deferentially by the security guard , the elevator starter and even the elevator operator . Everyone knows me , Eve thought . I 'm a Blackwell . The elevator took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Eve was seated in Brad Rogers 's office . Brad had been surprised when Kate telephoned him to say she was going to disinherit Eve , for he knew how much Kate cared about this particular granddaughter and what plans she had for her . Brad could not imagine what had happened . Well , it was none of his business . If Kate wanted to discuss it with him , she would . His job was to carry out her orders . He felt a momentary flash of pity for the lovely young woman before him . Kate had not been much older when he had first met her . Neither had he . And now he was a gray-haired old fool , still hoping that one day Kate Blackwell would realize there was someone who loved her very deeply . He said to Eve , " I have some papers for you to sign . If you 'll just read them over and ? " " That wo n't be necessary . " " Eve , it 's important that you understand . " He began to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust fund currently in excess of five million dollars . Your grandmother is the executor . At her discretion , the money can be paid to you at any time from the age of twentyone to thirty-five . " He cleared his throat . " She has elected to give it to you when you reach age thirty-five . " It was a slap in the face . " Beginning today , you will receive a weekly allowance of two hundred fifty dollars . " It was impossible ! One decent dress cost more than that . There was no way she could live on $250 a week . This was being done to humiliate her . This bastard was probably in on it with her grandmother . He was sitting behind his big desk , enjoying himself , laughing . She wanted to pick up the large bronze paperweight in front of him and smash his head in.  | She could almost feel the crunch of bone under her hand . Brad droned on . " You are not to have any charge accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blackwell name at any stores . Anything you purchase must be paid for in cash . " The nightmare was getting worse and worse . " Next . If there is any gossip connected with your name in any newspaper or magazine  --  local or foreign  --  your weekly income will be stopped . Is that clear ? " " Yes . " Her voice was a whisper . " You and your sister Alexandra were issued insurance policies on your grandmother 's life for five million dollars apiece . The policy you hold was canceled as of this morning . At the end of one year , " Brad went on , " if your grandmother is satisfied with your behavior , your weekly allowance will be doubled . " He hesitated . " There is one final stipulation . " She wants to hang me in public by my thumbs . " Yes ? " Brad Rogers looked uncomfortable . " Your grandmother does not wish ever to see you again , Eve . " Well , I want to see you one more time , old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brad 's voice trickled through to the cauldron of Eve 's mind . " If you have any problems , you are to telephone me . She doeli not want you to come to this building again , or to visit any of the family estates . " He had tried to argue with Kate about that . " My God , Kate , she 's your granddaughter , your flesh and blood . You 're treatin her like a leper . " " She is a leper . " And the discussion had ended . Now Brad said awkwardly , " Well , I think that covers every thing . Are there any questions , Eve ? " " No . " She was in shock . " Then if you 'll just sign these papers ... " Ten minutes later , Eve was on the street again . There was ? check for $250 in her purse . *  | The following morning Eve called on a real-estate agent and began looking for an apartment . In her fantasies , she had envisioned a beautiful penthouse overlooking Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a terrace where she could entertain guests . Reality came as a stunning blow . It seemed there were no Park Avenue penthouses available for someone with an income of $250 a week . What was available was a one-room studio apartment in Little Italy with a couch that became a bed , a nook that the real-estate agent euphemistically referred to as the " library , " a small kitchenette and a tiny bathroom with stained tile . " Is  --  is this the best you have ? " Eve asked . " No , " the agent informed her . " I 've got a twenty-room townhouse on Sutton Place for a half a million dollars , plus maintenance . " You bastard ! Eve thought . Real despair did not hit Eve until the following afternoon when she moved in . It was a prison . Her dressing room at home had been as large as this entire apartment . She thought of Alexandra enjoying herself in the huge house on Fifth Avenue . My God , why could n't Alexandra have burned to death ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eve had been the only heiress , things would have been different . Her grandmother would not have dared disinherit her . But if Kate Blackwell thought that Eve intended to give up her heritage that easily , she did not know her granddaughter . Eve had no intention of trying to live on $250 a week . There was five million dollars that belonged to her , sitting in a bank , and that vicious old woman was keeping it from her . There has to be a way to get my hands on that money . I will find it . The solution came the following day . " And what can I do for you , Miss Blackwell ? " Alvin Seagram asked deferentially . He was vice-president of the National Union Bank , and he was , in fact , prepared to do almost any-  | thing . What kind Fates had brought this young woman to him ? If he could secure the Kruger-Brent account , or any part of it , his career would rise like a rocket . " There 's some money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five million dollars . Because of the rules of the trust , it wo n't come to me until I 'm thirty-five years old . " She smiled ingenuously . " That seems so long from now . " " At your age , I 'm sure it does , " the banker smiled . " You 're ? nineteen ? " " Twenty-one . " " And beautiful , if you 'll permit me to say so , Miss Blackwell . " Eve smiled demurely . " Thank you , Mr. Seagram . " It was going to be simpler than she thought . The man 's an idiot . He could feel the rapport between them . She likes me . " How exactly may we help you ? " " Well , I was wondering if it would be possible to borrow an advance on my trust fund . You see , I need the money now more than I 'll need it later . I 'm engaged to be married . My fiance is a construction engineer working in Israel , and he wo n't be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seagram was all sympathy . " I understand perfectly . " His heart was pounding wildly . Of course , he could grant her request . Money was advanced against trust funds all the time . And when he had satisfied her , she would sent him other members of the Blackwell family , and he would satisfy them . Oh , how he would satisfy them ! After that , there would be no stopping him . He would be made a member of the executive board of National Union . Perhaps one day its chairman . And he owed all this to the delicious little blonde seated across the desk . " No problem at all , " Alvin Seagram assured Eve . " It 's a very simple transaction . You understand that we could not loan you the entire amount , but we could certainly let you have , say , a million immediately . Would that be satisfactory ? " " Perfectly , " Eve said , trying not to show her exhilaration . " Fine . If you 'll just give me the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen .  | " You can get in touch with Brad Rogers at Kruger-Brent . He 'll give you all the information you need . " " I 'll give him a call right away . " Eve rose . " How long will it take ? " " No more than a day or two . I 'll rush it through personally . " She held out a lovely , delicate hand . " You 're very kind . " The moment Eve was out of the office , Alvin Seagram picked up the telephone . " Get me Mr. Brad Rogers at Kruger-Brent , Limited . " The very name sent a delicious shiver up his spine . Two days later Eve returned to the bank and was ushered into Alvin Seagram 's office . His first words were , " I 'm afraid I ca n't help you , Miss Blackwell . " Eve could not believe what she was hearing . " I do n't understand . You said it was simple . You said ? " " I 'm sorry . I was not in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation with Brad Rogers . " Yes , there is a five-million-dollar trust fund in Eve Blackwell 's name . Your bank is perfectly free to advance any amount of money you wish against it . However , I think it only fair to caution you that Kate Blackwell would consider it an unfriendly act . " There was no need for Brad Rogers to spell out what the consequences could be . Kruger-Brent had powerful friends everywhere . And if those friends started pulling money out of National Union , Alvin Seagram did not have to guess what it would do to his career . " I 'm sorry , " he repeated to Eve . " There 's nothing I can do . " Eve looked at him , frustrated . But she would not let this man know what a blow he had dealt her . " Thank you for your trouble . There are other banks in New York . Good day . " " Miss Blackwell , " Alvin Seagram told her , " there is n't a bank in the world that will loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled . In the past , her grandmother had made it obvious in a hundred ways that she favored Eve . Now ,  | overnight everything had changed . She knew something terrible had happened between Kate and Eve , but she had no idea what it could have been . Whenever Alexandra tried to bring up the subject , her grandmother would say , " There is nothing to discuss . Eve chose her own life . " Nor could Alexandra get anything out of Eve . Kate Blackwell began spending a great deal of time with Alexandra . Alexandra was intrigued . She was not merely in her grandmother 's presence , she was becoming an actual part of her life . It was as though her grandmother were seeing her for the first time . Alexandra had an odd feeling she was being evaluated . Kate was seeing her granddaughter for the first time , and because she had been bitterly deceived once , she was doubly careful in forming an opinion about Eve 's twin . She spent every possible moment with Alexandra , and she probed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was satisfied . It was not easy to know Alexandra . She was a private person , more reserved than Eve . Alexandra had a quick , lively intelligence , and her innocence , combined with her beauty , made her all the more endearing . She had always received countless invitations to parties and dinners and the theater , but now it was Kate who decided which invitations Alexandra should accept and which ones she should refuse . The fact that a suitor was eligible was not enough  --  not nearly enough . What Kate was looking for was a man capable of helping Alexandra run Kate 's dynasty . She said nothing of this to Alexandra . There would be time enough for that when Kate found the right man for her granddaughter . Sometimes , in the lonely early-morning hours when Kate had trouble sleeping , she thought about Eve . Eve was doing beautifully . The episode with her grandmother had bruised her ego so badly that for a short time she had forgotten something very important : She had forgotten how attractive she was to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved into her own apartment , she gave her telephone number  | to six men  --  four of them married  --  and within twenty-four hours she had heard from all six of them . From that day on , Eve knew she would no longer have to worry about money . She was showered with gifts : expensive jewelry , paintings and , more often , cash . " I 've just ordered a new credenza , and my allowance check has n't come . Would you mind , darling ? " And they never minded . When Eve went out in public , she made sure she was escorted by men who were single . Married men she saw afternoons at her apartment . Eve was very discreet . She was careful to see that her name was kept out of gossip columns , not because she was any longer concerned about her allowance being stopped , but because she was determined that one day her grandmother was going to come crawling to her . Kate Blackwell needed an heir to take over Kruger-Brent . Alexandra is not equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One afternoon , leafing through a new issue of Town and Country , Eve came across a photograph of Alexandra dancing with an attractive man . Eve was not looking at Alexandra , she was looking at the man . And realizing that if Alexandra married and had a son , it would be a disaster for Eve and her plans . She stared at the picture a long time . Over a period of a year , Alexandra had called Eve regularly , for lunch or dinner , and Eve had always put her off with excuses . Now Eve decided it was time to have a talk with her sister . She invited Alexandra to her apartment . Alexandra had not seen the apartment before , and Eve braced herself for pity . But all Alexandra said was , " It 's charming , Eve . It 's very cozy , is n't it ? " Eve smiled . " It suits me . I wanted something intime . " She had pawned enough jewelry and paintings so that she could have moved into a beautiful apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded to know where the money had come from . For the moment , the watchword was discretion . " How is Gran ? " Eve asked . " She 's fine . " Alexandra hesitated . " Eve , I do n't know what  | happened between you two , but you know if there 's anything I can do to help , I 'll ? " Eve sighed . " She did n't tell you ? " " No . She wo n't discuss it . " " I do n't blame her . The poor dear probably feels as guilty as hell . I met a wonderful young doctor . We were going to be married . We went to bed together . Gran found out about it . She told me to get out of the house , that she never wanted to see me again . I 'm afraid our grandmother is very old-fashioned , Alex . " She watched the look of dismay on Alexandra 's face . " That 's terrible ! The two of you must go to Gran . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane accident . " " Oh , Eve ! Why did n't you tell me this before ? " " I was too ashamed to tell anyone , even you . " She squeezed her sister 's hand . " And you know I tell you everything . " " Let me talk to Gran . I 'll explain ? " " No ! I have too much pride . Promise me you 'll never discuss this with her . Ever ! " " But I 'm sure she would ? " " Promise ! " Alexandra sighed . " All right . " " Believe me , I 'm very happy here . I come and go as I please . It 's great ! " Alexandra looked at her sister and thought how much she had missed Eve . Eve put her arm around Alexandra and began to tease . " Now , enough about me . Tell me what 's going on in your life . Have you met Prince Charming yet ? I 'll bet you have ! " " No . " Eve studied her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was determined to destroy it . " You will , darling . " " I 'm in no hurry . I decided it 's time I started earning a living . I talked to Gran about it . Next week I 'm going to meet with the head of an advertising agency about a job . " They had lunch at a little bistro near Eve 's apartment , and Eve insisted on paying . She wanted nothing from her sister .  | When they were bidding each other good-bye , Alexandra said , " Eve , if you need any money ? " " Do n't be silly , darling . I have more than enough . " Alexandra persisted . " Still , if you run short , you can have anything I 've got . " Eve looked into Alexandra 's eyes and said , " I 'm counting on that . " She smiled . " But I really do n't need a thing , Alex . " She did not need crumbs . She intended to have the whole cake . The question was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekend party in Nassau . " It would n't be the same without you , Eve . All your friends will be here . " The caller was Nita Ludwig , a girl whom Eve had known at school in Switzerland . She would meet some new men . The present crop was tiresome . " It sounds like fun , " Eve said . " I 'll be there . " That afternoon she pawned an emerald bracelet she had been given a week earlier by an infatuated insurance executive with a wife and three children , and bought some new summer outfits at Lord &; Taylor and a round-trip ticket to Nassau . She was on the plane the following morning . The Ludwig estate was a large , sprawling mansion on the beach . The main house had thirty rooms , and the smallest was larger than Eve 's entire apartment . Eve was escorted to her room by a uniformed maid , who unpacked for her while Eve freshened up . Then she went down to meet her fellow guests . There were sixteen people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common : They were wealthy . Nita Ludwig was a firm believer in the " birds of a feather " philosophy . These people felt the same way about the same things ; they were comfortable with one another because they spoke the same language . They shared the commonality of the best boarding schools and colleges , luxurious estates , yachts , private jets and tax problems .  | A columnist had dubbed them the " jet set , " an appellation they derided publicly and enjoyed privately . They were the privileged , the chosen few , set apart from all others by a discriminating god . Let the rest of the world believe that money could not buy everything . These people knew better . Money bought them beauty and love and luxury and a place in heaven . And it was from all this that Eve had been excluded by the whim of a narrow-minded old lady . But not for long , Eve thought . She entered the drawing room and the conversation dropped as Eve walked in . In a room full of beautiful women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Eve around to greet her friends , and to introduce her to the people she did not know . Eve was charming and pleasant , and she studied each man with a knowing eye , expertly selecting her targets . Most of the older men were married , but that only made it easier . A bald-headed man dressed in plaid slacks and Hawaiian sport shirt came up to her . " I 'll bet you get tired of people telling you you 're beautiful , honey . " Eve rewarded him with a warm smile . " I never get tired of that , Mr. ? ? " " Peterson . Call me Dan . You should be a Hollywood star . " " I 'm afraid I have no talent for acting . " " I 'll bet you 've got a lot of other talents , though . " Eve smiled enigmatically . " You never know until you try , do you , Dan ? " He wet his lips . " You down here alone ? " " Yes . " " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could take a little cruise tomorrow ? " " That sounds lovely , " Eve said . He grinned . " I do n't know why we 've never met before . I 've known your grandmother , Kate , for years . " The smile stayed on Eve 's face , but it took a great effort . " Gran 's a darling , " Eve said . " I think we 'd better join the others . " " Sure , honey . " He winked . " Remember tomorrow . " * * *
