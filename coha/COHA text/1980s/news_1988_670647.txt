But Mr. Roh added that his setback in Tuesday ' s balloting could eventually prove to be a boon . " Depending on how we do from now on , the election results could expedite the process of political maturity , " he said. // Still , for the most part the ruling camp made no attempt to put a good face on the election , in which Mr. Roh became the first leader in South Korea ' s 40-year history to lose absolute legislative control. // The governing Democratic Justice Party still has the largest number of National Assembly seats , 124 of a total of 299 , according to an unofficial tally by the state-run television network . But that is well short of the 150 needed for firm control . The party ' s share of popular vote , 33. 6 percent with nearly all ballots counted , also declined from Mr. Roh ' s 36. 6 percent in South Korea ' s presidential election last December . <> <> Regular Compromise Ahead // To accomplish anything of importance , like passing the budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that will force Mr. Roh into something no South Korean leader has had to face : regular compromise with opposition parties committed to toppling his Government. // Korean political scientists and foreign diplomats predicted that when the legislature convenes in May it will become a focal point for a debate on delicate , even once taboo , subjects like high-level Government corruption and United States-South Korean relations. // Some , including members of the business community , expressed concern about political instability . On the Seoul Stock Exchange prices suffered their largest single-day decline ever. // Other Koreans , interviewed at polling places on Tuesday , said they had voted for Mr. Roh in the presidential election , but said they were now voting for opposition candidates to provide a counterbalance. // Still others argued that the Roh Government , an outgrowth of an authoritarian , military-installed regime , was getting its comeuppance after years of treating the legislature as a rubber stamp . <> <> Cabinet Overhaul Predicted // A more immediate concern for Mr. Roh is an imminent shake-up in his party ' s leadership and perhaps also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he has sought to distance himself from his unpopular predecessor , Chun Doo Hwan , Mr. Roh retained many Chun holdovers . These officials are likely to be among the first to go in a Cabinet reorganization , political commentators said. // For the next four years in the National Assembly , the ruling party must contend with three fragmented opposition parties , whose dominant figure once again is the hard-line Kim Dae Jung. // Mr. Kim was severely criticized for the split in the anti-Government forces that helped Mr. Roh win the presidency . Now , for the first time in more than 15 years , he is back in the assembly as perhaps the Government ' s most implacable enemy . <> <> Strength in the Southwest // By concentrating its strength in the southwestern Cholla region , Mr. Kim ' s Party for Peace and Democracy parlayed a relatively poor showing in the popular vote into a startling gain in assembly seats . It tripled its total , to 70 seats in unofficial tallies , including those won in district races and those awarded to it nationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reunification Democratic Party of Kim Young Sam , with 59 seats . After Mr. Roh , Kim Young Sam was Tuesday ' s big loser , even though his share of the popular vote was higher than the other Kim ' s , 23. 7 percent to 19. 2 percent. // Assuming the rival Kims can get back together again - not an immediate likelihood - Kim Young Sam is certain to be the junior partner. // The two men might also seek as allies 10 assemblymen elected from minor parties or as independents . <> <> A New Man to Watch // At a news conference , Kim Dae Jung said today that there was " no reason why I should not cooperate with Kim Young Sam . " He added : " I have learned my lesson in this election , and I believe Kim Young Sam has learned his lesson , too. " // The last big block of legislative seats , 35 , went to still another Kim , Kim Jong Pil , who emerged surprisingly as the man to watch . Mr. Kim , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular vote , is likely to be the power broker because his assembly votes will be courted both by the Government and the other two Kims . Without him , no side can put together a working majority. // A former Prime Minister in the regime of President Park Chung Hee , Mr. Kim also lost in the December presidential election and is widely believed to be looking to run again in four years . He ruled out any coalition with the Government , which he intensely dislikes . But then he also has no affection for the other opposition leaders , especially Kim Dae Jung . <> <> To Float Back and Forth // So he is expected to float back and forth between the various camps , depending on the issue . " I know we hold the casting vote , and we are ready to exercise it in a very constructive way , " he said today. // The opposition parties are likely to spend the next few weeks and months figuring out new working relationships to press their various agendas effectively . Because of their relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological and class lines , all they can do for now is say no to the Government . They can not put through programs of their own. // Kim Dae Jung in particular is expected to be a gadfly in the legislature . Among sensitive topics that might be raised , they said , are corruption scandals surrounding former President Chun Doo Hwan , calls for an investigation of the 1980 Kwangju massacre , demands for local autonomy and even foreign-policy matters such as South Korea ' s increasingly nasty trade disputes with the United States . <> <> Every Issue a Battle // " Quiet government-to-government diplomacy is not going to work , " a diplomat said . " Every major issue is going to be battled over in the National Assembly. " // A big factor in the election was South Korea ' s deep regional antagonisms . They figured prominently in the December presidential balloting , and , if anything , they have solidified. // None of the four major parties could claim true national support . Mr. Roh ' s strength was centered on Taegu ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won only 9 of 42 seats. // Kim Young Sam dominated in and around Pusan , and Kim Jong Pil in southern Chungchong Province. // But Kim Dae Jung ' s party demonstrated the regional problem most vividly . It captured all 37 seats but one in his native Cholla , and that one is expected to switch over to the party soon . At the district level , Mr. Kim ' s group did not win a single seat anywhere else except in Seoul , where many former Cholla residents live. //
