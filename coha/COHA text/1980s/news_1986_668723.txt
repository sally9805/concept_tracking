Although he ' s a communications major , Louisville point guard Milt Wagner has more than a passing interest in chemistry . Not the kind that is practiced in laboratories by mad scientists in white smocks , but the kind that is formulated on a basketball court by talented athletes in white socks . It is chemistry , Wagner postulates , that has Louisville , despite seven defeats , still hopeful of making its fourth Final Four appearance of the decade . It is chemistry , he further speculates , that may have De Paul precariously balanced on the brink of extinction . " De Paul has great individual players , " Wagner said . " They ' re very physical . They can beat you on any night . They just haven ' t been able to put the chemistry together . " Indeed , De Paul has performed on occasion as if Dr. Jekyll were the team chemist . Unless coach Joey Meyer is able to find the proper mix Saturday , when the Blue Demons ( 13-8 ) meet the Cardinals ( 17-7 ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 : 30 p. m. ) , the whole season could blow up in his face . A fourth home defeat , even to a team as talented as Louisville , would not sit well with the NCAA selection committee . " When you ' re 13-8 , " Meyer observed wryly , " you ' ve got to look at every game like that . " Wagner , meanwhile , has been the catalyst on a Louisville team that seems to be following coach Denny Crum ' s time-tested formula to perfection . Crum always has brought his Louisville teams to the flashpoint at the proper moment of the season , losing big games early and winning them late . Of the Cardinals ' seven losses , six have come on the road and five to top 10 teams . Saturday ' s game is their fourth in a row on the road in an eight- game stretch , and victories at Virginia Tech on Monday and Cincinnati on Thursday indicate Louisville is again reaching its potential at the right time . " We ' re finding that chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really rough . But it ' s good preparation for the tournament . We ' re learning from our mistakes on the road . We ' ve been close to winning a lot of times . ( Louisville lost by two points at Kansas and Memphis State and by five at Kentucky . ) " It helps our freshmen out playing against the top teams early . It gives them the feel of how the tournament is going to be . The older guys have experienced it already . " Wagner has experienced the Final Four twice , as a freshman and sophomore , and says the current team " has as many tools as we had in those years . " In Wagner ' s junior year , the Cardinals were knocked out of the tournament by Kentucky in the Mideast Regional semifinals . And last season , they did not even receive a bid . But last season there was a significant missing ingredient  --  Wagner . After scoring 17 points in a season-opening victory at Indiana , Wagner broke his right foot in the next game . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he recalled , " and I came down on his foot . Usually you twist an ankle when you do that , but I broke the foot . " Wagner initially was told he ' d be out six weeks . " But I knew I wouldn ' t be back until tournament time , so I decided to sit out the season . I thought it would be best for me and the team . " Wagner could have entered the National Basketball Association draft last June . " But I wouldn ' t have gone as high as I wanted because of the injury , " he said . " There were a lot of doubts out there and I wanted to prove to the doubters that it ' s all right . " He has proved it without a doubt , averaging 15 points a game to lead a team that is tremendously balanced in scoring . All five starters are averaging in double figures . Wagner says the injured foot is 100 percent healed . " I ' m playing some of the best basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came around . I lost a lot of rhythm on my jump shot and , at first , my shooting percentage was off . But once I got in the flow , my total game came around . " It is the jumper , says Meyer , that defines Wagner as a basketball player . " When you talk about Milt Wagner , you see that picture-book jumper . It ' s the first thing I think about . " But Wagner , with time to think about a lot of things in his year off the court , has worked hard to improve his overall game . " I worked a lot on ballhandling , " he said , " and I ' ve become a team leader . I ' ve matured a lot after sitting out a year .
