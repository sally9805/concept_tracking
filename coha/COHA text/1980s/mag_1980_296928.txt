Researchers cast new doubts on their methods and results <P> The publication in 1970 of Human Sexual Inadequacy , by Dr. William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson , was one of those events that transform the clinical landscape . Afterward sex therapy seemed a brave new world , and Masters and Johnson were its gurus . Already known for their significant findings about the physiological processes involved in sex , the pair devoted the book to the therapies they had developed at their St. Louis clinic for such problems as frigidity , impotence and premature ejaculation . Over a period of 16 years , they reported , they treated 790 cases , mostly involving married couples ; in each case they conducted intensive sessions for a few weeks , then followed up with consultations for five years . They laid claim to a remarkable success rate : only 20% of their patients , they said , failed to respond . <P> Last year Masters and Johnson published Homosexuality in Perspective , describing a similar program for homosexuals ; this time , they said , only 28% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters and Johnson record in sex therapy was unparalleled , even unique , and therein lay the catch . Other sex therapists have since been unable to match their success rate and consequently have been growing increasingly skeptical of the reliability of their findings . Now two California psychologists , Bernie Zilbergeld and Michael Evans , in the current issue of Psychology Today , have written the sharpest , most substantial attack yet . " Masters and Johnson 's research is so flawed by methodological errors and slipshod reporting that it fails to meet customary standards-and their own-for evaluation research , " say Zilbergeld and Evans . " This raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the ten-year-old discipline they created . " <P> The key to evaluating any research - " the only impeccable yardstick , " as Masters and Johnson themselves put it - is the ability of other researchers to duplicate the results using the same techniques . But , say Zilbergeld and Evans , it is impossible to tell from Masters and Johnson 's own account precisely what they did and how they did it . Among many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Masters and Johnson define success and failure in sex therapy ? Who decided if treatment had succeeded ? By what criteria ? <P> Many of Masters and Johnson 's patients tended to be highly motivated and prescreened through referrals by psychiatrists and psychologists ; hence they were probably likely to respond to treatment . Zilbergeld and Evans fault Masters and Johnson for not being more candid about the special nature of their sample . Masters and Johnson never divulged how many applicants they considered and how many they rejected , nor how many were accepted and then later quit or were asked to leave . Similarly , in their study of homosexuality , Masters and Johnson used a Kinsey-developed system of seven categories of sexual preference . Of their 67 patients , 82% fell under the heading of bisexuals , or " flawed " heterosexuals . This calls into question their claim to have turned true homosexuals to heterosexuality , say Zilbergeld and Evans .
