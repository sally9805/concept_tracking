The words are attributed to the late Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois , but they are beginning to apply , on a much smaller scale , to individual retirement accounts . A husband and wife , for example , who have both made the maximum $2 , 000 annual IRA contributions every year since IRAs were opened to the general public in 1982 , could have $16 , 000 , plus interest , in their retirement funds as of this year . At that level , financial planners say , it ' s time to begin thinking about diversification. // ' ' In some ways investing in an IRA is no different than any other kind of investing , ' ' says Joshua Young , a vice-president in the trust division at State Street Bank in Boston . ' ' We definitely agree that diversification is a sensible thing to do . If you ' re going to invest in stocks or equities , you should also invest in some kind of fixed income security. ' ' // // When IRAs were first opened to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed foolhardy to many people . This is , after all , retirement money we ' re talking about , and in retirement planning , that means security , which means caution. // ' ' Many people started with product IRAs , ' ' says Dodge Dutcher , director of trust services at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . ' ' A person would go to the bank and open an IRA with CDs . An awful lot of people started with these safe-decision vehicles. ' ' // But that is changing . Now , partly due to falling rates on certificates of deposit and the strength in the stock market , stocks and mutual funds have been getting the lion ' s share of the growth . In 1984 the fastest-growing segment of the $140 billion-plus IRA market was ' ' self-directed ' ' accounts , growing from 9. 2 percent of the market in 1983 to 12. 1 percent . Self-directed IRAs are usually held by brokerages and thus permit customers to buy and sell stocks and bonds . The share of self-directed IRAs matches the 12. 1 percent held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January 1982 , according to the Investment Company Institute , the mutual fund trade group . This left mutual funds and self-directed accounts with over 24 percent of the IRA market , up from about 20 percent the year before. // That still leaves banks , thrifts , mutual savings banks , and credit unions - institutions in which virtually all deposits are insured - with over 65 percent of the IRA market. // But even these institutions are looking for ways to serve the IRA customer who wants diversification . At Bank of America in San Francisco , for instance , a ' ' multi-rate accumulation account ' ' permits switching money between a bank account , a mutual fund , or a discount brokerage account through its Charles Schwab subsidiary . New York-based Citicorp also offers discount brokerage services for IRAs , as do a growing number of banks and thrifts around the country . Citibank figures to have 10 to 15 percent of its IRA customers in mutual funds , stocks , or bonds by the end of the year , says Cindy Colitti , assistant vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more risk with an IRA can also been seen in the expanded list of offerings from insurance companies , brokerages , even from seemingly unlikely places as firms selling limited partnerships in real estate and equipment leasing . With 20 , 30 , or more years to save , more people are recognizing that even a small difference in yield can mean a lot more money at retirement. // ' ' People are not looking so much for diversification as improvements on return , ' ' says W. Wesley Howard , editor of the IRA Reporter , a trade newsletter . While it is possible for an individual to have $8 , 000 plus interest in an IRA this year , most are much smaller than that , so diversification is not yet an issue . Near the end of last year , he figures , the average IRA contained only about $3 , 500. // Even with that amount , though , higher yields can make a difference in the long run , Mr. Howard argues . ' ' Outside of an IRA , a difference of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make more risk worth the effort . But within an IRA , a minor difference in interest rates over 20 or 30 years will make several thousand dollars of difference. ' ' // Many people , however , don ' t have 20 or 30 years before retirement . They should not be thinking about taking on additional risk . If you plan to retire within five years , for example , buying stocks for your IRA could lead to disaster if the market loses strength suddenly . A younger person has time to wait for the market to give back losses and provide new gains ; an older one does not. // Likewise , an older person should not tie up funds in investments that take a long time to mature , like long-term bonds or limited partnerships. // Some financial advisers , in fact , advise against using the IRA as a place to try out newer or riskier investments . ' ' If you want to take risks , do it in your personal account , not in the IRA , ' ' recommends Barbara Drebing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisory firm . Because the earnings in an IRA are tax-free , so are the losses , she notes . ' ' You can ' t take capital gains or losses in the IRA , ' ' which eliminates one of the important incentives for buying riskier investments in the first place. // Mr. Dutcher of Shearson Lehman Brothers agrees . ' ' Professionally , I ' m not sure I approve of the more daring approach , ' ' he says . ' ' In a general account , you can write off losses if the stock drops . There is no credit for these losses in an IRA. ' ' // That does not mean this brokerage executive is against having any stocks in an IRA as long as people recognize that some are more appropriate for an IRA than others . Stocks with a long history of steady growth and dividend payments fit this standard , he says . And because ' ' money can ' t come out of the IRA without penalty , you have money eligible for full-cycle market work. ' ' // If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way is to put a small portion of it into a growth stock or aggressive mutual fund . Some people may be able to sit back and watch the performance , which might contain wild price swings , and remain calm . Others will find themselves getting very uncomfortable with the same trends . If you find yourself in the latter group , retreat to the safer investments. // Mr. Howard at the IRA Reporter also urges caution when going into unfamiliar investments . Although limited partnerships are available , he notes , not that many people - especially those who plan to depend on the IRA as their primary source of retirement income - know enough about these investments to pick the good deals from the bad ones. // One way to balance risk and security could be used by a husband and wife who have their own IRAs . ' ' You could leave the husband ' s IRA in time deposits , and put the wife ' s in stocks , ' ' suggests Warren Branzburg , vice-president for retirement products at Bank of America . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other IRA is safely earning market-level interest rates. // If you do keep all or part of your IRA in time deposits like CDs , keep close tabs on them . One-year yields are now running between 9. 5 and 10 percent , but last year they were in the 12 percent range . Instead of simply letting your bank roll your old 12 percent CD into a 9. 5 percent successor , consider looking for a better deal elsewhere. // That may mean another bank or a savings and loan . Or it may be a mutual fund or a brokerage , two busineses that have been advertising heavily to capture people who are dissatisfied with the performance of their IRAs as well as those who are looking for diversification. // For investors who want to diversify but don ' t want to keep track of several separate accounts , mutual funds are the easiest way to go . Even if you invest with a single fund , your risk is spread among dozens of securities managed by professional investors . Spreading your investment around is even easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can put some money in a money market fund , some in stocks or bonds ( choose your degree of risk ) , or some in government securities . In a no-load fund group you can move between different funds without having fees deducted for every switch. // The attractiveness of mutual funds is a major reason banks and S &; Ls are offering them , whether through their own brokerage subsidiaries or through outside discount brokers . But since an important criterion for selecting a mutual fund is long-term performance , people interested in a fund for a long-term IRA relationship may want to keep this in mind before moving over to a fund set up to capture IRAs. // Wherever you go , there are some things that need checking before signing up for the new account . For example , all institutions offering IRAs are required to provide a disclosure statement showing how $1 , 000 a year deposited in an IRA will grow until you reach age age 70. // But the statements provided by some of these firms may be using a slightly higher yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer . This may be simply a matter of failure to update the calculations when rates change , but whatever the reason , it is worthwhile to double-check the rate on the account with the figure on the disclosure statement . Not doing so could mean a difference of nearly $100 , 000 after 40 years of $2 , 000 annual deposits. // //
