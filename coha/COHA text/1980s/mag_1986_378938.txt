Reporting the news is rarely a Monday-through-Friday job , and TIME often goes to extraordinary lengths to cover late-breaking events . By any standard , however , last weekend 's Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Reykjavik posed a challenge . It was a big story , of course , big enough for TIME to send eight reporters and five photographers to Iceland . The meeting , moreover , was set to conclude early Sunday afternoon , well past the hour that TIME 's presses normally start to roll . <P> Printing deadlines can be set back , and they were . But to ensure that the magazine reached its readers with the smallest possible delay , all aspects of the process , which normally takes most of the week , had to be compressed into less than a day . To handle the abundance of late reporting transmitted from Iceland , where clocks are four hours later , writers and editors assigned to the story in New York City began their work before dawn on Sunday . <P> One of the weekend 's toughest tasks was to get color photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state-of-the-art relay system that converts images into computer digits and sends them via satellite . " This allows us to get pictures of Sunday events and still ship the magazine to readers at or near the usual delivery time , " explains TIME Corporate Production Director Bob McCoach . To transmit the photos , Britain 's Crosfield Electronics , maker of the complex system , rounded up the sophisticated and bulky equipment and shipped it by air from London to Reykjavik . <P> At TIME 's Manhattan headquarters , the data were changed back into pictures at our high-tech facility known as IMPACT , for Image Processing and Color Transmission , where the magazine 's stories and illustrations are assembled into pages each week . IMPACT then beamed the late-closing pages to TIME 's U.S. and overseas printing plants . " Because the pages dealing with Reykjavik were held past deadline , we had to arrange special late crews at all ten U.S. plants , " said Corporate Operations Manager Elaine Fry . " Extra delivery trucks were dispatched in some cities to rush the issue to the newsstands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted by the opportunity that the Reykjavik story gave IMPACT to show its mettle . After all , she says , " the whole purpose of IMPACT is to reduce the time it takes to get news from the writer 's desk to the readers . " A Sunday-morning presidential meeting in Iceland was a special test , but that goal is one that TIME pursues each week of the year . <P> Richard B. Thomas
