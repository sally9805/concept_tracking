ALICE IN CONCERT A musical by Elizabeth Swados <P> This is a tale of two ladies . One of them ( Meryl Streep ) is very , very good , and the other ( Elizabeth Swados ) is very nearly horrid . Her work , that is . For a woman who has acquired an exaggerated reputation as a composer , Swados displays an anemic talent for making anything remotely resembling good music . For someone who is 29 , she is strangely fixated on the ' 60s . Her songs , both for Alice in Concert and her previous show Runaways , a short-lived paean to urchin street vandals , sound , at their very best , like numbers that the composers of Hair threw in the wastebasket . <P> If a " truth in packaging " law applied in the theater , Lewis Carroll 's name would have to be removed from the label . A footnote in the program asserts that the show is based on Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass . This is rather like claiming that a bag lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic can produce ironic historic resonances , as in Jean Giraudoux 's sophisticated reshaping of the Greek myths . At other times , sloppy , inane , incongruous desecration masquerades as creative reincarnation , and the people involved spout rubbish about " making the work speak to our own time . " In the present instance , Joseph Papp , who took over as director from Andrei Serban and at whose off-Broadway Public Theater Alice in Concert is being presented , reveals no guiding wisdom or purpose . <P> Neither he nor Swados has the foggiest notion of Carroll 's substance or sensibility . The Alice books are funny . This show is frowningly earnest . Wit requires a surrounding quiet in order to be heard . This show is noisy , bustling , full of motion but lacking in any discernible destination . Carroll was a master of wordplay . In this " adaptation , " whatever words survive from the original are drowned in the nondescript tunes . Above all , Carroll saw the adult world through a child 's eyes , that is , as a theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as illogic by a child , and its arbitrary punishments are edged with psychological menace . This production contains no hint of these elements ( they were rewardingly incorporated in Andre Gregory 's brilliantly intuitive off-Broadway re-creation of ten years ago ) . <P> Even Streep , whose lustrous presence and finely pitched acting skills provide the only reasons for purchasing a ticket , is not cast with total precision . Carroll had a predilection for small girls . Streep is so far from being petite that she might have intimidated that slight figure of a man . However , the radiant tightness of her features , her gestures , her bearing and her voice leads us into the vernal garden of childhood and the willing sus pension of disbelief . She turns two scenes into acting marvels . In one she mimics Humpty Dumpty about to fall off the wall but retaining full possession of a frog-horned comic baritone voice , and in the other she conducts the dialogue between Alice and the White Queen , taking both parts in a way that would have enchanted Oscar Wilde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare or Shaw , instead of gracing this cacophonous chicken coop of a musical ?
