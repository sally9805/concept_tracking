His meek appearance masked the fact that Larry Wu-Tai Chin was a master of deception . For nearly 30 years , Chin , 63 , a naturalized American citizen who had been born in Peking , lived a double life . While working as a highly valued translator and analyst for the CIA , he also passed classified documents to the People 's Republic of China . His duplicity earned him at least $300,000 , and though he gambled much of it away , he had parlayed his take into real estate and other investments worth $700,000 . Throughout his four-day trial , Chin insisted that he had only intended to improve relations between his homeland and his adopted country . Nevertheless , he became the first American to be convicted of spying for China , and faced life in prison . <P> When the jury found him guilty , Chin showed no emotion . But that too , it seems , was just another ruse . Last week in a Virginia county jail , where he was being held pending a March 17 sentencing , Larry Chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought breakfast to his cell . But later in the morning , they found the inmate lying unconscious with a plastic bag wrapped around his head . Efforts to revive him failed .
