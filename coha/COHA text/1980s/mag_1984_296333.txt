THE SICILIAN by Mario Puzo Simon &; Schuster ; 410 pages ; $17.95 <P> The Godfather was an irresistible tale of corruption and an equally tempting celebration of two sacred institutions , the family and free enterprise . The Sicilian , an offshoot of the 1969 bestseller , is also an offer of evil and romance that can not be refused . Mario Puzo remains one of America 's best popular storytellers , though his years of whittling movie scripts have resulted in chapters that seem spindly next to those in the full-bodied Godfather . In fact , the novel could be cut down and inserted in the earlier book . Offstage , at Mafia Central on Long Island , Don Corleone directs events that have profound effects in Sicily and teach Son Michael a cruel lesson in survival . <P> The time is 1950 , and young Corleone is preparing to end the two-year exile imposed after he killed Sollozzo the Turk and the corrupt Police Captain McCluskey . Michael 's final assignment is to arrange the escape of a Sicilian outlaw who has become an endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the runaround and a chance to witness treacheries that seem to have originated in the Punic Wars . <P> Puzo works hard to make his story back-lot mythic . Spartacus led his slave army out of the Cammarata hills to fight the Romans . A skeleton dug out of the rocky soil is said to have belonged to one of Hannibal 's elephants . The novel 's hero , Turi Guiliano , is a Latin Robin Hood who can recite the Song of Roland and the basic guerrilla manual with matching ease . When he is not slipping into Montelepre for his mother 's cooking and the attractions of a young widow , Turi muses under starry skies : " He no longer doubted that he had some magnificent destiny before him . He shared the magic of those medieval heroes who could not die until they came to the end of their long story , until they had achieved their great victories . " <P> Guiliano dreams of smashing the power of the " Friends of the Friends . " Sicilians , Puzo tells us , never say Mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years later , the word is dark with irony . Founded to fight foreign oppressors , the organization has come to include the island 's most terrible despots . Their fingers can be found in every business and social institution from Palermo to Catania , their hands behind countless murders . Puzo offers swatches of sad history and exotic sociology . Mussolini nearly wiped out the Mafia , but the U.S. Army ensured its comeback when it unlocked Fascist prisons . Kidnaping is a cottage industry , monks fake relics , and omert , the code of silence , is so pervasive that strangers often can not get directions to their hotels . Casting a large shadow over all this is Puzo 's Don Croce Malo , a model of the fatal charm and intricate cunning of a successful mafioso . <P> With the exception of Michael Corleone , Turi Guiliano is the shallowest major character in the novel . He reads good books , idealizes justice and respects religion . But if he has a thought subtler than how to trap his enemies , he keeps it to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and chief lieutenant , has a vivid psychology that eventually sustains Horace 's 2,000-year-old observation that " Sicilian tyrants never invented a greater torment than envy .
