The figures supplement a report made available in September showing that overall reading achievement in the school system increased in 1980 from the year before . " We have some positive signs , but we ought not to overstate the meaning of individual test results , " School Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola said then. // The proportion of pupils in grades 2 through 9 reading at or above the national average in 1980 was 46. 7 percent , according to the figures , and in 1979 it was 40. 3 percent. // For each of the city ' s 32 community school districts , the table lists schools in order of their students ' performance on the test , with the schools that scored highest listed first . The percentages show the proportion of pupils in each school reading at or above their grade levels . The next column gives each school ' s rank in the city as a whole . Elementary schools are ranked 1 to 630 and junior high schools are ranked 1 to 182. // Educators suggest that the figures be interpreted cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent families , they are at a disadvantage when their scores are compared with school systems in the suburbs and other wealthier areas. // Students with limited proficiency in English were excused from taking the New York City test , and their scores were automatically put at below grade level , according to the report . <> <> MANHATTAN District 1 <> <> Lower East Side <> <> School%Rank <> 11053. 2241 <> 14043. 8338 <>

Farrell // Alfred Grossman needs a modest city rent subsidy to maintain a marginal middle-class existence that is threatened by an impending rent increase. // The management company won ' t give the needed permission for the subsidy in the middle-class apartment building at 50 West 97th Street , where Mr. Grossman lives , for fear of setting a precedent that smacks of welfare. // Alfred Grossman , the tenant , is upset by the stalemate . But Alfred Grossman , the author of dark and scathing urban satire , sees the impasse as the sort of mordantly funny thing that finds its way into his sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had multiple sclerosis . A year later , the progressive disease confined him to a wheelchair . Today , the 53-year-old writer lives alone in a sunny apartment , no longer able to control the anarchy of his body but very much in control of a mind that is often wickedly funny . Mr. Grossman copes. // He speaks with great difficulty , the words coming much slower than the thoughts that impel them . Everyday , a housekeeper , paid for by Medicaid , calls on Mr. Grossman and fixes him a hot dinner that she feeds him . She leaves him food for his other meals that he can handle without having to use a utensil. // Some time ago , he was informed he was eligible for housing assistance from the city to augment the Social Security check he lives on . The particular city program he is eligible for would provide a stipend of about $90 a month . An official of the New York Housing Authority , familiar with Mr. Grossman ' s case , says the program requires a landlord ' s consent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s part. // John E. Zuccotti , a lawyer and deputy mayor during the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame , is attempting , so far without success , to persuade the building ' s agent , Goodstein Management , 211 East 46th Street , which acts for the landlord , Central Park Gardens Inc. , to sign. // Jack Goodstein , a partner in the management company , is on a three-week vacation and unavailable for comment , according to Mr. Goodstein ' s office . His partner and brother , Steve Goodstein , says he does not deal with rental matters and is unfamiliar with the case. // The city housing authorization for the stipend will expire next Friday unless all three parties involved - the tenant , the housing authority and the landlord - sign. // A decade ago , about the time when Mr. Grossman ' s fourth novel , " The Do-Gooders , " was published , Anthony Burgess , the British writer , labeled Mr. Grossman " one of the most brilliant of the younger American novelists " because his work was " vital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In a favorable review of the novel , John Leonard said that Mr. Grossman ' s world was " like entering a crypt and hearing laughter , finding in the dark a joke-machine cycled all the way up to hysteria. " // " I ' m afraid of falling into one of my own books , " says Mr. Grossman , sitting in a wheelchair in his apartment and reminiscing about a boyhood in " darkest Larchmont " and his eventual arrival in New York " to have the handcuffs sawed off. " // " For a year or so , I was sunk in apathy , " he says of his illness . " I used to batter the typewriter myself . Eventually , I realized that if I was to keep on writing , then I would damned well do it by voice , however peculiar and croaking that voice is. " // He writes , he says , for about five hours a day , carefully composing in his head , then dictating into a tape recorder .
