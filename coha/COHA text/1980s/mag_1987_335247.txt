Whether or not the Conservatives remain in power , Britain 's new Parliament will almost surely be different in one significant respect : color . Although about 4% of the country 's 56 million people are nonwhite  --  mostly of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin  --  there have been no nonwhite members in the House of Commons in 58 years . Three Asians served briefly between 1892 and 1929 , but no black has ever taken a seat . This time three nonwhite candidates , all running on the Labor Party ticket , are expected to be among the 650 members of the new Commons . Says Marc Wadsworth , a black television journalist who is not a candidate : " Our time has come . " <P> Political momentum appears to be on the side of further change : last year more than 140 nonwhite candidates were elected to local councils in Greater London . In the current campaign for Parliament , the Tories , the Labor Party and the Social Democratic-Liberal Party Alliance are fielding a total of 27 nonwhite candidates . Virtually assured of winning are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Council Leader Bernie Grant , a Guyanan ; and former local Councilor Diane Abbott , who was born in London of West Indian parents . All are Labor candidates in London constituencies with substantial Labor majorities . More than 30% of the districts ' voters are nonwhite . <P> Future gains , however , may not come easily , in part because of Labor 's poor showing in opinion polls . As the political home for most Asian and black voters , the party has long championed racial equality . But its leaders are fearful of a white backlash if Labor appears to support too many black candidates , some of whom are outspoken radicals associated with the party 's " loony left . " Racism also poses a formidable electoral hurdle . " In the U.S. , at least it is never questioned that blacks are Americans , " says Boateng . " The tragedy is that however long you are here , even if you were born here , you can never be British . " <P> Abbott , 33 , a Cambridge history graduate and now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her politics was influenced by U.S. civil rights activists . " People like me in their 30s had our ideas shaped by Angela Davis and the black-power movement , " she says . Grant , who heads the local council in Haringey , has been unflatteringly labeled Barmy Bernie by conservative tabloids . It was he who declared that police had been given a " bloody good hiding " after a 1985 race riot in Tottenham during which a patrolman was hacked to death . Grant has since kept a relatively low profile . <P> More militant blacks have meanwhile seized public attention with calls for affirmative action at the highest levels of the Labor Party . Journalist Wadsworth , for example , is chairman of the four-year-old Black Sections National Committee , which demands that nonwhites be named to all of Labor 's decision-making groups . Party Leader Neil Kinnock , eager to soften Labor 's radical image , is in no mood to bow to such demands . Nonetheless , Black Sections leaders have turned up the heat . At their fourth annual conference last March in Nottingham  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repeal of Britain 's immigration controls . They also drafted a statement describing the police as a " force of intimidation " in local housing projects and demanding an " end to their dubious presence in the schools . "
