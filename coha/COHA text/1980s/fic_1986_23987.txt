S T OR Y THE ART OF CARTOGRAPHY By J. S. Marcus Iread , in several newspapers , about a man from Los Angeles who wanted to go to Oakland . Nothing unusual . A business trip . A family visit . Accounts varied . Some hours later , when his plane landed in Auckland , New Zealand , hands went up in the air . The passenger , the airline , and certain readers considered explanations . Had there been a clerical error ? An auditory hallucination ? A conspiracy ? It 's like all those bombs that never seem to go off . Physically , economically , politically , nobody wants to be in the middle . Everybody wants to be on the edge . The effort made , the money spent , the stance taken , only the furniture remains . People are leaving their homes , their families , their careers , some  --  like our man in Auckland without even knowing it . Jaunts to the Horn of Africa . Forays into Eastern Europe . Helicopter drops in South American jungles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the room . Our film director , a man renowned for his bitterness , bloomed during his month in Belgrade . He toured studios , drank seriously with other directors , wooed young actresses in pidgin Serbo-Croatian . Back in London , with news from the front , he 's full of unassailable epigrams . " There used to be alchemists and goldsmiths . Now there are only goldsmiths . " He raises a glass of whiskey . " One can no longer create , " he says . One can only refine . " The star of our film , a rock singer from Glasgow , is mumbling about bootleg rapes in BangJ . S. Marcus 's fiction has appeared in the New Yorker . His first book , a collection of stories , will be published by Alfred A. Knopf , kok . A graphic designer , who is not connected with our film , is trying to play a joke on the other guests by pretending to be an ex-convict . The production assistant goes to make coffee ; she is certain all her guests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do " a little bit of everything , " and 1 often feel the need to ease tensions  --  at parties , on the set . I bring a cup of coffee to the rock star . I ask the graphic designer about the wallpaper at Reading Gaol . I begin a conversation with our editor 's little sister . She is in London for a week , before spending another week someplace else , and she tells me about a bomb scare in a boutique on the King 's Road , a bomb scare in Harrods , a bomb scare in a restaurant . " That 's one bomb scare for every day I 've been here , " she says . I get her a second cup of coffee , and she tries not to stare at the rock star , now lying on the floor with his pants undone . Our director , more disgusted than usual , says , " There used to be alchemists and goldsmiths . Now there are only rock-and-roll singers . " And terrorists . Ikeep moving to new places for indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to shoot on location in Dubrovnik . Our producer , a kind man with a large retinue , made the trip to Dubrovnik , but he and certain members of the retinue came down with dysentery . Our producer is holding a grudge . The Scottish rock star goes on tour in six months . Talks are at a standstill . We could fire the director , or wait for him to quit , or hold out on principle . Or I could quit , or hold out for more money . But none of us seems to do anything , except wait  --  at parties , in restaurants , on the telephone . As an employee of the production company , my professional allegiances are with our producer . As someone who has never been to Dubrovnik , my personal allegiances are with our director . I have no choice , then , but to wait  --  in the middle . Our director has given a party and not invited our producer . A playwright , standing in the pantry , is discussing his day : " My day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lemon . Later , I have a hard-boiled egg . Before I go to sleep , I have another glass of water , and perhaps another slice of lemon . " The director 's wife , an Austrian ? migr ? , puts on a record called The Unknown Kurt Weill . She translates a song for the people at the bar : " This is a song of the Brown Islands . The men are evil and the women are sick . A lady ape does business there , and the fields are withering from the stench of oil . " A woman with dyed hair comes up to the bar , carrying the director 's signed photograph of Samuel Beckett . " Beckett , " she says . " Beckett . Is there a more beautiful word in the English lan-guage ? " The other day , in the backseat of a taxi , I found a Gothic romance entitled Mistaken Intentions . The cover showed a man and two women . The first woman was staring at the man , who was staring at the second woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman seemed tobe in love with the man , and probably assumed he was in love with her . But he was n't . He was looking affectionately at the second woman , who seemed to be the first woman 's friend , or neighbor , or sister . Something . I assumed the Gothic romance belonged to a previous rider , or perhaps it was the taxi driver 's . After I left the taxi , the driver yelled out the window : " You 've left your book here ! You 've left it in this cab ! " I read Mistaken Intentions , and as it turns out , the second woman was not related to the first ; they were , at least according to the author , total strangers . And what seemed like betrayal was , in fact , a coincidence . Xlistaken intentions are everywhere . Our The production assistant 's neighbor , boasting connections , invited us to the opening of a political advertising firm . Fifty people were marching in front of the office building , shouting anti-apartheid slogans , banging their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose connections amounted to having slept with the secretary , assured us , over the screams , there would be cases of champagne . The political advertising firm , it turned out , had been established to represent certain interests of the South African government , and certain individuals in Zimbabwe . A man with a polka-dot tie approached us to deny the rumor he 'd planned the demonstration as a publicity stunt . The sec-retary kept apologizing for the sudden disappearance of all the champagne . I kept drinking Scotch and innocently speaking to guests . One of them , a man from the Foreign Office , tried to describe certain repatriation legislation pending in the House of Commons : " The idea , of course , is to pay every West Indian three thousand pounds , how shall I say , to go from whence they came . " During much of his description , I felt like I was passing out . He kept filling my glass , exposing statistics , offering personal tours of Whitehall . Later , a woman from Cape Town gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man I have to share a flat with  --  about the man from the Foreign Office , he was n't surprised . He was barely interested . Peter talks about nothing but sex and money . He has stacks of imported pornography , and books with titles like A Wine-Lover 's Guide to Opera and A Porcelain-Lover 's Guide to Great English Country Houses . He lives beyond his means , and needs to share his flat so he can continue buying expensive wine , going to the opera , paying the mortgage on his country house . I 'm not sure where the porcelain fits in . I have n't seen any porcelain around the flat . Perhaps he hides it instead of the pornography . When he 's in London , which is usually one night a week , Peter brings friends over for drinks . First , they drink all the wine , then the gin , and finally the beer . The guests are always doctors , lawyers , stockbrokers , and occasionally inheritors like Peter . At around one in the morning , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter tells his Princess Margaret story . A few years ago there was a luncheon given which included among its guests both Peter and Princess Margaret . To the astonishment of everyone , Peter fell sound asleep . According to Peter , he and Princess Margaret have n't spoken since . Each time he tells the story , the guest list becomes smaller and smaller , and his nap becomes longer and longer , until there 's no one but Princess Margaret and Peter , with his head in a salad . After all the guests have gone , Peter puts the glasses on the mantel and calls a woman named Chloe . He gets ready to leave , and I wo n't see him again until the next week , when he arrives with new friends and more bottles . He always looks embarrassed when he leaves , like he knows that I know Chloe is a prostitute . he old questions . The old answers and the old questions are best , but people still want the most for their money . I found my flat through an agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I walked in , a middle-aged woman sat me in a chair and said , " You know , we do n't take just anybody . " I smiled , trying to be civilized . She told me about her first husband 's childhood in India , and her first husband 's family , once prominent in Madras , former collectors of Chandrapure . I continued smiling . She told me about her own childhood in Kenya , and her difficult romance with her second husband , an army officer who spent a good deal of time away from home . Now that I think about it , Kenya was the test . Peter 's flat was the least expensive , but the middle-aged woman insisted I first look at something respectable . She sent me to a flat in St. John 's Wood owned by two middle-aged sisters . The sisters worked at the same office , slept in the same bedroom , and seemed quietly insane . I was then sent to a flat in Fulham owned by a psychiatrist , who told me about a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to pin down the problem on appearances alone , " he said . " For instance , certain schizophrenics shake in certain ways . Bulimics have marks on their knuckles from sticking their fingers down their throats . " He showed me a photograph of a woman with blue hair and blue tattoos all over her body . " She wants to change colors , therefore she wants to change sexes . " He pointed at her mouth . You ca n't actually tell from the photograph , but she 's even had the dentist put little blue stones in all her teeth . " The psychiatrist was a nervous wreck . He kept checking his watch , running into the kitchen . His hands shook when he talked , I spent an entire afternoon at the house of impoverished German aristocrats . The mother refused to speak English , the father was dead , and the family estate was now in Poland . The son , who seemed to be in his thirties , met me at the door . He told me that he wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a movie star . I drank hot chocolate while he talked about great conductors , how von Karajan or Furtwangler would n't hesitate to slap a soloist or storm offstage during a concert . The daughter , who came home later , was a Judy Garland fan and had just seen Babes on Broadway . She translated the lyrics for her mother : " Wit verliessen Topeka , verliessen Eureka , um eine neue Karriere anzufangen . " She stopped for a moment . " Oh , I 've forgotten ! " she said to me . " Except for the last part . " She turned to her mother . " Und wir sind Babys am Broadway jetzt ? " The old questions . In German , " wo " looks and sounds like " who , " but actually means " where . " And " wer " looks and sounds very much like " where , " but actually means " who . " With the German aristocrats , I tried using my high school German . The mother was describing a restaurant , and 1 asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gegessen ? " And who did you eat , meine Dame ? The daughter , Ulrike , laughed . The mother , Frau von Heuren , stared . And the son  --  the son , Gunter  --  acted impatient . Like I should be slapped . The only cast member who has been to Dubrovnik is an actor who is actually a musician . He has a supporting role as the rock singer 's best friend . In real life he 's a lutanist and an authority on Renaissance music . One afternoon , we met for tea in Clapham . He explained that he was scheduled to play a cruise later in the summer , and that in the fall , he was scheduled to write the music for a television biography of Rubens . He does n't want to give up the cruise , which is going to the Galapagos Islands . On his last cruise , in the eastern Mediterranean , he 'd had an affair with an Israeli soldier in Tel Aviv . " I learned how to fire a gun , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score for our film , but the story takes place in the late 1970s , and it would be his first attempt at anything contemporary . " I distrust the new , " he said . " Of course , most people feel that way now , which helps explain this place . " He told me about the wave of nostalgia flooding England : people are taking out their central heating , combing deserted warehouses for authentic Victorian fabric , using Georgian recipes , rereading Restoration comedies , listening to troubadour music , fawning over Romanesque architecture . " And they 're flocking to these sorts of places , tearooms that play Gracie Fields records and put Gentlemen 's Relish on toast  --  as if it were 193 7 . " He finished his own toast and offered me a ride back to Belgravia . From whence they came . Back where they came from . Homeward bound . Accounts did vary , but they concurred on one thing : the man in New Zealand did n't get a free ride . The airline refused to fly him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends could get money together for the plane ticket . He had wanted to go to Oakland , and he ended up in debt . His instincts  --  to get on the plane , not to get off the plane , to leave home in the first place  --  had betrayed him . " Because I love you " is an old answer . Lately , I 've been calling old girlfriends long-distance , suggesting they quit their jobs and immediately move to London . They always ask why . Why should I quit my job as a social worker , which pays me twelve thousand dollars a year ? Why should I leave my rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan , which costs me eight hundred dollars a month and still has your name on the lease ' Why ? I always present an economic argument  --  discount flights , cheap theater tickets , favorable exchange rates . It 's more efficient for you to live in London . You really have no other choice . They always say yes , yes , see you next week . And we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing , positively believing , that we 're both kidding ; knowing , instinctively , that it 's all a joke . At a party , I met a mercenary . He had just left Afghanistan , where he 'd been fighting the communists , and was on his way to Nicaragua to fight more communists . He described a process invented by the Russians to strip the skin off Afghan rebels . " It 's psychological warfare disguised as chemical warfare , " he said . " The Moslems believe in the ' pure warrior , ' sanctity of the body , that sort of thing . When they see rows of bodies with the skin peeling off , they go mad . " He drank his champagne . " They believe the skinless soul is doomed , gone to hell . " At a restaurant in Chelsea , everything is ' a la carte . The waitress is Canadian , and she insists that I am Canadian . She wo n't take no for an answer . " Well , where are you from , then ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown Islands . " I just walked over from Belgravia , " I tell her . he effort made , the stamp licked , the ticket stamped , and still things end up in wrong places . A bomb in Antwerp was scheduled for a synagogue , but the terrorist misread the map and blew up a block of jewelry stores . Diamonds filled the streets , clogged up ventilation systems , dropped out of rain gutters . In a rare moment , our director and producer met for lunch . The film will be shot in Blackpool , the director 's birthplace . Dubrovnik will be saved for later . Everyone is relieved . The rock star is relieved ; tickets for his first stadium date go on sale next week . The production assistant is relieved ; she 'll be home in time for the new television season . My flatmate is relieved . He thinks he can get twenty pounds more a week from the next American . I tell all this to the Canadian waitress , and she says , " Where 's your next movie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you go ? And then where ? ?
