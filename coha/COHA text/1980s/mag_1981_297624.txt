But when the French liner burned and capsized at its Manhattan dock in 1942 , it was not so much its beauty that was mourned as the loss of one of the fastest passenger ships ever built , then being refitted as an Allied troop transport that could outrun any U-boat . In Normandie Triangle ( Arbor House ; 475 pages ; $13.95 ) , Novelist Justin Scott evokes the grace and power of the great ship even as he describes its destruction and welds an ambitious Nazi stratagem to the smoldering hulk . <P> The U.S. Navy insists that the Normandie 's sinking was accidental .

Father Leo Tunney , a Roman Catholic missionary and sometime CIA operative , totters back to civilization from the Cambodian jungle , where he has been missing for 20 years . Why ? Before shipping him back to his order in Florida , the Company does its unsubtle best to pry the answer from the emaciated priest . Back home , Tunney attracts a lot of professional interest . There is a top KGB operative from Moscow , a sacerdotal snooper from the Vatican , a cold-blooded loner from a <P> Washington intelligence unit and enough assorted goons to fill a San Quentin production of A Chorus Line . <P> What they are all after is a journal in which the priest describes a Cambodia-based Soviet military project that could trigger World War III .
