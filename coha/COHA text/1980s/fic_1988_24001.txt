MI S C E L L A N Y MAN AND HIS WATCH Esquire 's promotional advertising ... will lead off with a picture of a man ... fin ) a sports shirt open to expose a hairy chest upon which nestle nine gold chains with pendants . The ... copy . . . sets the tone for the campaign to follow : It may surprise you to learn how few men have the taste or the means to acquire the finer things in life . In fact , fewer than 1 percent of American men spent $1,000 or more on a watch in the past year . " ? " Advertising " column , New York Times , April I 1988 Jack Magnuson braced his big rancher 's hands on the glass display case and looked down at the rows of wristwatches . Not that looking meant he was set on buying . He could tell from the slant of sunlight on the Mobil pump across the street that it was exactly one-thirty  --  time to mosey on home , sit down at the old burled-walnut desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , where it was two-thirty , as any damn fool could figure out . Veronica Geng 's second collection of fiction , Love Trouble is My Business , will be published this fall by Harper &; Row . A story for our time By Veronica Geng The store manager , Alvin Seitz , stood behind the counter in attentive patience , for Jack Magnuson was the most prominent man in town and a favored customer at Walgreen 's , which took pride in its tradition of supplying the Magnuson Ranch with the finest in dishrags , rubbing alcohol , and other sundries . From above the open neck of Jack 's plaid flannel shirt , a chest hair drifted down onto the glass countertop . Alvin courteously leaned over and blew it off . Jack was thinking that he already had Great-Grandaddy 's gold pocket watch . Of course , Jack had n't spent his own money on that ; it was a reflection of somebody else 's taste and means . Great-Grandaddy had bought it , so the story went , from a peddler on the Chisholm Trail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The watch had some sentimental value it had saved Gran-daddy 's life when a Comanche axe glanced off it , and Daddy had worn it as ambassador to the Court of St. James 's . Still , the resale value was n't but a couple of hundred dollars . And now this morning on the telex from New York City , Jack Magnuson 's investment counselor had asked him out of the blue whether he 'd spent a thousand dollars or more on a watch in the past year . So Jack had got to wondering why he never had , and what it would be like if he did , and whether it was the kind of thing a man ought to do . He tried to remember watches he 'd seen on men he respected  --  men in a position to know and appreciate the best that life could offer . There was Judge Burleigh , a connoisseur of rare bourbons and fine-looking female civil-liberties lawyers . But the Judge had been in Washington during the New Deal , and still favored the Brain Trust fashion for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yam . Alvin cleared his throat and said , " Any particular one catch your eye , Jack ? " " Well , now , Alvin , 1 do n't know . They all look right nice . " He thought of Jody Windermere , trustee of the Grange Hall Art Museum . Considering the impeccable cut and sheer luxuriousness of the string tie Jody had on at the champagne reception for the exhibit of all those fine-looking Minoan pendants , he surely had the wherewithal for the perfect watch . But Jody traveled a lot on museum business , and had picked up the continental curators ' style of just carrying an alarm clock in a briefcase . Alvin was looking awfully eager to oblige , so Jack said , " What is the price range on these ? " " These here are forty dollars . " Jack 's face fell , and Alvin added , " These other ones go on down to ten . You can get yourself a pretty good watch for ten dollars , and I would n't try to tell you different . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriends in Paris and have her send somebody over to that Cartier place , but instinctively he rebelled against the notion that a man could n't spend a grand on a watch in his own hometown , if he happened to feel like it . Jack wondered if it would count to buy twenty-five forty-dollar watches . He guessed that Coach Whitehead , his hero from his days at Trinity College , Cambridge , would have said that was cheating . Anyway , the Coach had been famous for just drawing the numbers from one to twelve on his wrist with a fountain pen and then telling time by the way the angles of his wrist hairs reacted to momentary changes in atmospheric pressure . But what about getting a hundred ten-dollar watches ? Maybe that would be eccentric enough to qualify as a costly personal statement . Like the time that little operator at Drexel Burnham Lambert had tried to get him to take over Walgreen 's and liquidate its assets , and just to spite that sucker he 'd gone out and bought him-self 14,000 head of prize longhorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tawny flanks to the fine sheen of a premium motorcar 's custom enamel . A hundred watches , though  --  Alvin would think he 'd gone loco . And no way to claim they were presents for the ranch hands ; it was common knowledge that all Jack 's men had taken up the new Schick disposable watches , grateful that nowadays a man could spend a long hard day out on the range , mending fences till the barbed wire took on the hand-honed keenness and lustrous patina of the finest set of imported kabob-skewers , and then ride home , wash off the dust , put a pot of coffee on to perk , and throw away his watch . As Jack stood there trying to think of a different excuse for buying a hundred watches without getting a reputation around town as a wastrel frittering away the family fortune on accessories , old Yancy Beeb came into the store for a dozen of the Anchor Hocking pilsner glasses on sale . If there was anybody in this neck of the woods who qualified as a genuine celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once taken Ernest Hemingway on a snipefishing trip . Jack noticed that fancy did n't have on a watch , so he went over and said howdy , and one way and another he finally worked Yancy around to the subject of watches . " Used to wear one , " said Yancy . " That was years back . And then Papa told me  --  this was around the rime of the snipefishing trip , you know , and he was real mad at me  --  he told me it was decadent to wear a watch . He said that Coop  --  that was Gary Cooper , you know  --  Coop said any real man could tell the time of day lust by checking the amount of wear on his boot heels . Well , in spite of the fact that it was Papa talking , that just sounded like plain common sense . So I tried it . Never worn a watch since . " Jack speculated as to how Yancy might he having some fun with him . But to humor the old man , he lifted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot , which gave off a fine aroma like the subtlest master blend of calfskin-bound first editions , wet Donegal tweeds , pre-war Havana Per-fecto Perfecto stubs , overpriced designer cologne , and burning plastic collectibles . The tiny scratches and abrasions on the heel formed a pattern he 'd never noticed before-a pattern unique to that moment , which was two o'clock , three in Chicago , closing time on Wall Street , and sunset on Madison Avenue . ?
