From smoggy Seoul to the bustling port of Pusan , usually industrious South Koreans last week simply refused to do any more work . Strikers shut down the country 's showcase automobile industry as well as textile factories and chemical plants . Taxi drivers and bus operators in Seoul and Kwangju declined to accept passengers . In all , some 200,000 workers were idled by job actions . A striker in Pusan expressed the pent-up frustrations of many : " It is our turn to receive humane treatment . We have the right to a decent living . " <P> The strikers were doubtless encouraged by the success of the militant students , who , after months of periodic rioting , finally won major political concessions from the government . South Korea 's 10 million workers , on the other hand , have gained comparatively little from their country 's vaunted 20- year-old economic miracle . While industrialists have reaped huge profits , little of the wealth has trickled down to those manning the factories . South Koreans last year put in the longest workweek in the industrialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only $1.55 an hour in manufacturing jobs , compared with $7 for their Japanese counterparts and $13 for those in the U.S. <P> Under the government of Chun Doo Hwan , striking for better pay has been almost unheard of . Walkouts were virtually banned , and unions were strictly under the thumb of Seoul . But since June , when Chun capitulated to popular demands for democratic reform , both the government and the opposition have expressed sympathy for the workers ' plight . " It is true that the government has sided with management in the past out of the need for growth and stability , " said Roh Tae Woo , who heads the ruling Democratic Justice Party , " but it must now side with labor to compensate for sacrifices made for the nation 's economic development . " <P> Independent labor organizers took advantage of the new atmosphere to spark a series of work stoppages that reached new peaks last week . Assembly lines ground to a halt at the electronics giants , Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar . Earlier , Hyundai Motor Co. , producer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to ship 6,000 cars . Though the government is leaving the search for solutions to labor and management , it began to move against the violence prone , arresting two workers for destroying an auto-parts factory and three fishermen for wrecking equipment in a Pusan market . Warned Labor Minister Lee Hun Ki : " If the current disputes are further aggravated to threaten the national economy and the security of our society , the government will take tough actions .
