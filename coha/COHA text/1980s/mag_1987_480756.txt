Not long ago I borrowed a car , loaded it with 211 phonograph albums that had been sent to me by record companies over the past three years , and drove to a secondhand record store , where I sold them for about $150 . This was illegal ; the albums were plainly marked " demonstration ? not for sale " ( though every record company knows that many of the critics on its mailing list derive a sizable share of their income by selling these albums ) . I did n't set out to break the law ; but I 'd offered a dozen or so people as many records as they could carry away , and I 'd gotten no takers . Selling the records seemed somehow better than simply dumping them in the street ? or keeping them . Of the roughly 500 albums I 've received in the past five years , maybe thirty were worth keeping . It 's not easy for me to say that . Since the age of thirteen ? that 's twenty-one years ago ? I have lived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereos Mark Hunter writes about music for the International Herald Tribune . and in rock clubs , listening , dancing , performing , falling in and out of love . I believed , as a California dance-hall queen told me once , that " rock-and-roll will keep you young . " That the music itself would one day grow old was beyond imagining . Yet from what I hear , and I have heard an awful lot , the great creative period of this music is over . What has aged rock music is n't merely or mainly laziness or a lack of imagination ? though there has been more than enough of that . The overwhelming problem is the new technology behind the backbeat and the changes it has set in motion , changes that demand an entirely different approach to music from the one that initially made rock a fresh and exciting form . Technology , in music as in every other field , has its imperatives as well as its possibilities . For rock , the imperatives have proved deadly . am fully aware that most rock fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology involved in making records . But given the extraordinary extent to which rock music has penetrated our lives ? a number-one pop hit today could be defined as a song that nearly everyone in the world will hear at least once ? one might well take an interest in how it was recorded , and how this in turn shapes the kind of music being made . The fact is that what might be called the content of rock ? the songs , the sound ? follows to a great extent from formulas imposed by recording techniques . And these formulas are giving us music that is murderously dull . he worldwide rock explosion began in 1963 when the Beatles set off what would become , within a decade , a doubling of global record and tape sales ( to about $2 billion worth ) . The Beatles represented something new in pop music , but it was not their beat that was new so much as the fact that they were a self-contained composing , arranging , and performing unit . In this way they were quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by pop composers and arranged by record label " A &R"; ( artist and repertoire ) directors . The great bands of the " British Invasion " of the mid1960s ? the Who , the Animals , the Rolling Stones ? were similarly self-reliant , as were the literally thousands of rock bands that sprang up in England and the United States in the wake of their success . The Beatles and the other great British bands arrived on the scene just ahead of a profound change in recording techniques ? the move from monophonic taping , in which all the instruments used in a composition are recorded simultaneously on the entire width of the tape , to " multitracking , " in which each instrument is recorded on a separate band of tape and then " mixed down " into the final product . The shift to multitracking took time , and its progress was reflected in the argot of the recording studio . In the 1960s , when a recording artist or engineer spoke of a " track , " he meant an entire song ( as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical pop album as " a hit single and ten tracks of shit " ) . Since the mid-1970s , " track " has been used to describe one instrumental or vocal part of a composition . In the monophonic era , recording a song meant gathering an ensemble in a room , putting out one or more microphones , and recording the music in one " take , " live . If you did n't like the take , you did it over , period . This was how Elvis Presley 's epochal first recordings for the Sun label were made in the early fifties , and it remained the standard technique ( there were some exceptions ) through the mid-sixties . The advantage of this method , in retrospect ? at the time , engineers and producers simply had no other methods available ? was that players could inspire one another to the kind of extra effort that comes only in ensemble work . If you have ever played in a good group , you know what those moments are like : suddenly , each musician seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens on Elvis 's " Mystery Train " ; Scotty Moore ( on guitar ) and Elvis ( singing ) anticipate each other 's phrases , arriving together just ahead of where the ear would expect the beat to fall , driving the song toward a mounting excitement . There is no drummer on " Mystery Train , " but that does n't keep you from dancing to it . The disadvantages of this method were considerable , however , and evident even at the time ? in particular , the difficulty in getting a distinct sound color , or timbre , for each instrument , and in capturing a performance in which every musician and singer was at a peak . Producers went crazy when one verse on a take was poorly sung but the rest were superb , because there was no way to cut out the bad and keep the good . Engineers went crazy trying to keep the sounds of drums and amplified guitars from ending up in the singer 's microphone . It could be done , but it was hard , and it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into wide use and made possible a rhythm-section sound of extraordinary power . Engineers developed techniques that ameliorated these problems , but they could not solve them entirely . By recording the instruments first , for example , and then rerecording this tape onto another , simultaneously with a live take of the singer , the problem of instruments fouling up a brilliant vocal could be eliminated . Unfortunately , every time sounds are transferred from one tape to another , there is a loss in quality . Producers tried to get as much of the sound on tape in a single take as possible , and to limit the number of times they made additions to the original performance . That is why Phil Spector introduced bigger rhythm sections to pop , and why he used such innovations as " massed pianos " on the sessions he produced for the Crystals in 1961 and 1962 . The only way to achieve orchestral depth was to record an orchestra . All this changed with the invention of stereo machines with three recording heads ( or " capstans " ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record the vocals and instruments on separate tracks . He could " punch in " a performer at a given moment on a recording , and then " punch out " in confidence that the new , punched-in sounds would be in sequence with the rest of the composition . Simply put , it was no longer necessary to record a song from beginning to end . " Synchronization " opened the way to true multitrack recording . The pop album that most profoundly signaled this shift was the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released in 1967 . The album was recorded on a four-track machine , the best then available , and the shock it caused when it was released , for rock musicians and listeners alike , was manifold . To start with , all the lyrics are comprehensible on first listening ? this was a rock rarity in 1967 . Moreover , by recording the various parts ? bass , drums , vocals , horns , guitars ? on separate tracks , stopping periodically for " premixes " in order to combine several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the final stereo product , the Beatles achieved a precision and clarity of each instrument and effect that was unprecedented in pop . When next you hear that album , note how McCartney 's bass line on " Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! " is distinctfrom the rest of the sound ; on the Beatles ' earlier records , the bass blends in with the drums and rhythm guitars , an angry roar at the bottom of the sound . In essence , the techniques used to make Sgt. Pepper allowed the Beatles to compose an album , instead of performing it as they would onstage . When it soared to number one on the charts , those techniques became a commercial imperative . ( Think of the Stones , who rushed onto the market the slipshod Their Satanic Majesties Request ? a hash of psychedelic effects and chopped-up song structures . ) In the wake of Sgt. Pepper , rock performance and rock recording became sharply divided domains . Eventually , that gap became the gulch where rock ran dry . ith multitracking , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present at the same time ( a point underlined by the Beatles in 1969 in the making of Abbey Road ; rarely were all of them in the studio together ) . Once the bass line was on tape , the bass player could go home . Conversely , if one player made a mistake , only his part needed to be rerecorded . Moreover , thanks to the process of overdubbing , which allows the engineer to record over selected portions of a track , the performance of a given player on a song no longer had to be continuous . If one verse was no good , the singer could re-take it . And the engineer could " treat " the sounds electronically during recording or mixing to alter their timbre . These techniques all but eliminated what had always been an essential element in rock , the concept of ensemble spontaneity . Cream 's marvelous recording of Robert Johnson 's " Crossroads , " for example , contains some notes that might as well not have been played , but one hardly notices them because the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass , and Ginger Baker on drums ) adapt their individual intensity and attack to one another 's work , moving in and out of the lead as the moment demands . In multitrack work , where musicians take turns recording their parts , it is nearly impossible for an individual player to alter the ensemble 's direction in this manner . A mistake will sound like a mistake , instead of a cue for the rest of the ensemble to incorporate an accident into a large effect . Multitracking also changed the dynamic flow of individual performances . All music achieves its effects through contrast ; soft moments set up the tough ones , which in turn give way , relax . This follows naturally from performing a song in its entirety . In the version of " Try a Little Tenderness " that Otis Redding and his backup band , the Bar-Kays , recorded in the mid ? sixties , Redding keeps a certain power in reserve until the final measures , when he pleads outright with the listener to " love her , please her , never leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frenzied crescendo . In the multitrack era , when a musician will cut an entire track and then go back to " correct " certain passages , often phrase by phrase , performances tend to settle at a single dynamic level . Vocalists in particular seem to lose a sense of overall dynamic flow . Listen to Madonna 's " Material Girl " : the final chorus sounds just like the first . Along with this loss of dynamism there is , on an overwhelming number of records , an absence of rhythmic invention . On one disc after another there is the " boom-BOOM " of a thudding bass drum followed by a snare enveloped in reverberation ? a " handclap " effect . Part of the reason for this awful sameness is that multi-tracking has led musicians and producers to think of rhythm as a domain unto itself , which it decidedly is not . When you listen to the records Marvin Gaye made for Motown in the monophonic era , records like " Ai n't That Peculiar , " you ca n't help but notice that piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single timbre . It is practically impossible to hear the sound of the bass drum separately from the sound of the bass guitar on this record , which is no doubt why the drummer chose to rely on his sharply percussive snare drum to set the beat . The way the timbres of their instruments would eventually come through on tape forced the musicians to think of rhythm as being the domain of no one instrument , but rather as an element emerging from a dynamic equilibrium among the members of the ensemble . When multitracking made it possible to record the bass and drums separately , and to hear them distinctly even at high volumes , the role of rhythm musicians was deeply altered . Their sound was no longer far back in a percussive cloud , but could be moved right to the front of the mix ? which works just fine in discos and dance clubs , where you listen mostly with your feet , but not at home in front of the stereo . You can hear the difference on a collection of " never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early seventies and put on the market last year under the title Motown Remembers Marvin Gaye . Some remembrance : on nearly every song new bass and drum parts have been added through multitrack overdubs and mixed into the forefront . You can follow the beat more easily ? even a deaf person could feel the impact of the bass drum ? hut its texture has been impoverished , cut off from the rest of the sound . Before mulritracking came along , a " groove " meant the sense of swing inherent in an entireways . For one thing , it cut short a revolution in the creative politics of the music industry . The people who rose to the top of the industry in the sixties , people like Clive Davis of Columbia , believed in letting rock bands " do their own thing " in the studio . That made sense when what counted on a record was the ensemble creation . It no longer made sense with multitrack machines . Aside from the fact that the entire ensemble is no longer needed to finish a record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who understand the new techniques better than most musicians do . Moreover , anyone who has recorded both monophonically and multitrack will tell you that it takes far longer to make a record one sound at a time . In the studio , time is money , and in the multitrack era time costs more money than ever : studios have to update their equipment constantly to remain competitive , and the price of the investment is passed on to musicians and their record companies . In the early sixties , the cost of recording a typical " commercial " album ? that is , one whose sound quality appeals to radio programmers and the average record buyer ? was a few thousand dollars ; the cost rose to $100,000 in the mid-seventies , and now often reaches twice that figure . With that much money at stake , most contracts now specify that the record company has the right to choose the producer ; and , to an extent unmatched since the pre ? Beatles days , those producers tend to impose proven commercial styles on artists . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Police made their first and , in terms of dynamic variation , perhaps their best album , Out/andos d'Amour , they recorded each song as an ensemble , overdubbing only vocals and a few lead parts . In an attempt to retain control of their sound and hold down costs the group re56 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE /MAY corded the songs in a sixteen-track studio . ( The standard number of tracks is now twenty-four ; Yoko Ono has actually recorded on ninety-six tracks . ) In effect , the Police made a multitrack record by a monophonic method . ( By contrast , consider the fate of the Humans , an idiosyncratic Santa Cruz band whose first ? twenty-fourtrack ? album , Happy How , has a flat , compressed sound quite unlike the group 's roaring surf-meets-psychedelia live sound , but quite like their producer 's last hit . Not surprisingly , it bombed , taking the Humans down with it . ) Multitrack technology long ago altered the terms of live performance as well as audience expectations . In the sixties , rock bands typically amplified each instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood garage band or the Jimi Hendrix Experience . The result was a charged , erratic , stormy sound . But when multitracking took hold , the rock public began to demand that live concerts sound as " clean " as studio recordings , and so stage amplification moved in the direction of complex live-mixing systems that could faithfully reproduce studio sound . These mixing systems sent the cost of concert production through the roof . And , in doing so , they drove a wedge between the thousands of Local groups that constitute the amateur base of the rock movement and its better-heeled professional practitioners , who are the only ones who can afford the new equipment . The punk movement of the mid-seventies angrily attempted to restore sonic amateurism to rock . When you listen to the Sex Pistols ' Never Mind the Bollocks , it is like having hot metal poured over your head . But punk did n't sell ? not much , anyway ? and the New Wave music that followed ( and drew on punk ) confirmed the takeover of the technicians . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as went music , so went the clubs where it was played . Rock club owners began to realize that their expensive sound systems could be amortized ? without the hassles and expense of hiring musicians ? simply by using them to play records for people who did n't care how the sound was made , so long as they could dance to the beat . The result was that the club scene sharply declined . Today , no major city boasts more than a few live-rock clubs of any distinction . And almost all rockers now mix records for dance clubs , which have become a crucial promotional route . The most pronounced sound on these " disco mixes " is the monotonous domination of bass and drums . The decline of the club scene has wiped out the major training ground for rock musicians , and destroyed whatever claims rock had to the status of modern-day folk music . Folk music is , above all , local music , made by musicians playing their own arrangements of a broad standard repertoire as well as their own compositions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Bruce Springsteen , for that matter , got their start . These artists began by copying songs from records , then changed the arrangements to suit their own ideas and talents . A good example is the way the Band rearranged " Mystery Train , " substituting Rick Danko 's stuttering bass for the guitar that drives Elvis 's classic . By the time these musicians started writing their own material , they had already developed large repertoires and coherent , instantly recognizable ensemble styles . And they had been able to refine their styles over time before live audiences . In the mid-1980s , such an apprenticeship is no longer possible for new bands . With club space reduced to a few showcases in major cities , most bands do n't have the opportunity to play four sets a night in the same club for a week . They have to play forty-five minutes ' worth of music ? enough to prove to any record company executives in the audience that they can make an album . When Spandau Ballet , one of the aurally anonymous " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded its first recording contract , the members of the group had been playing together for six months , and knew one set of material .
