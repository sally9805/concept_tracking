PARTY SHAPES YOUNGER FUTURE headlined the English-language China Daily last week , shortly after the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had &lt; ended a closed meeting at Peking 's Great Hall of the People . It was an unprecedented gathering , with dozens of senior officials voting " voluntarily " for their own retirement . As expected , China 's leader , Deng Xiaoping , 81 , had successfully cleared the way for the promotion to positions of power of some 70 of his younger loyalists . The only surprise , in fact , was the extent to which he had carried the day . All told , the party announced the retirement of ten of the 24 members of the ruling Politburo and 64 of the 340 permanent and alternate members of the Central Committee . <P> Among the 131 senior party officials who resigned were a few supporters of Deng 's modernization drive and daring economic reforms . The majority , however , belonged to an older , revolutionary generation whose primary loyalties were to the past . Gone were half a dozen aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 88 , who had helped Mao Tse-tung plan the Long March of 1934-35 ( see SPECIAL SECTION ) . Gone too was Politburo Member Deng Yingchao , 81 , the widow of Premier Chou En-lai and the country 's highest-ranking woman official . Also on the retirement list were three former Ministers of Public Security , as well as such veterans of the Cultural Revolution as Wang Dongxing , 69 , a onetime Mao bodyguard who in the mid-1970s rose to become a vice chairman of the party . <P> The most significant changes involved the People 's Liberation Army , a bastion of reactionary opposition to Deng 's economic and political reforms . Defense Minister Zhang Aiping , 75 , though widely credited with having helped to modernize the armed forces , was dropped from the Central Committee , leading to speculation that he might soon lose his government post as well . Among other military retirees was Zhang Zhixiu , 67 , former commander of Chinese forces along the Vietnamese border . Zhang had reportedly been eager to teach the Hanoi government , a bitter enemy of Peking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than successfully in 1979 . Zhang was overruled by Deng , who was said to have feared that the general was developing a " mountain-stronghold mentality , " a tendency to take matters into his own hands . <P> Obviously age was not the only consideration in deciding which generals should shed their uniforms . Both Chief of Staff Yang Dezhi , 75 , and Peking Garrison Commander Qin Jiwei , 74 , are older than some of the retirees , but both are staunchly loyal to Deng , and both remain in their posts . Generally , as in his decision earlier this year to decrease by one-fourth the 4 million- strong armed forces , Deng 's aim is to reduce the power and influence of the military establishment , thereby strengthening his own leadership and programs . The process should be completed this week when the Central Committee , in another closed session , chooses the younger and for the most part better- educated Deng loyalists who will replace the retiring veterans .                @ @ @ @ @
