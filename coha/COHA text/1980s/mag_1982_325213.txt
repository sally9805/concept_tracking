While the military sulks , the voters look left to Gonzlez <P> Felipe ! Felipe ! " came the joyous chants from 10,000 supporters who had gathered at the soccer stadium in the industrial city of Valladolid for the campaign rally . As the candidate with the flashing smile and thick black hair took the stage , the crowd clapped and cheered its approval . " After 150 years of govern-ment by the right , we must try to put this country on the march , " he declared , stabbing the air in a gesture of challenge . " And that can only be done by the Socialist Party ! " <P> The speaker was Socialist Leader Felipe Gonzlez , 40 , the most popular politician in Spain and the overwhelming favorite to win next week 's parliamentary elections . That would put him in position to become Spain 's first leftist Prime Minister since the end of the civil war in 1939 . Gonzlez 's remarkable ascendancy reflects , at least in part , the fact that Spanish democracy has matured in the seven years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while not endorsing any party in the campaign , is understood to believe that the country 's fragile institutions can be strengthened and even improved by successful alternations of power . <P> But the prospect of a Socialist victory has also raised fears that military right-wingers might try to intervene .

" <P> The growing popularity of the Socialists has largely coincided with the collapse of the Union of the Democratic Center ( U.C.D. ) , the coalition of right-wing and center parties that has governed the country since its first democratic elections in 1977 . After 45 deputies defected from both the right and left wings of the party over the past eight months , wiping out its effective majority in the Congress of Deputies , Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo asked King Juan Carlos to dissolve parliament and hold new elections five months ahead of schedule . <P> Since he took over the Socialist leadership in 1974 , Gonzlez has built a reputation for moderation . In 1979 , for example , he persuaded the party to drop the term Marxist from its platform . He has supported the government on such issues as antiterrorist laws and regional autonomy , and proceeded to mold the party in the pattern of social democratic parties elsewhere in Western Europe .
