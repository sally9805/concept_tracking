A shotgun approach to p.r . <P> Mike Martin is a piece of work . He was rated one of the ten worst legislators in the state by Texas Monthly magazine-in his first term . His mania for publicity alarmed even close associates . Says Leslie Smith , Martin 's former public relations spokesman : " He was always intent on staging something to show himself as the clean-cut Christian battling the forces of evil . " But Martin 's earlier stunts were trifling compared with what happened at 2 a.m. on July 31 . <P> Returning to his mobile home in Austin , the Republican representative was struck in the left arm by three buckshot pellets from a twelve-gauge shotgun , and his car was riddled with dime-sized holes . At various times since then , Martin , 29 , has said his arm was raised to protect himself , to yawn and to check the time . Wayne House , then a legislative aide to Martin , took him to a hospital . But even then , House started to wonder : Had Martin staged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had . Martin , a conservative Baptist , had set his sights on a state senate seat , and the assassination try sounded suspiciously like a p.r . gambit . Before the shooting , he had composed an " emergency list " of people to contact should anything happen to him ; at the top , above his family , was his public relations man . Associates also noticed tiny discrepancies every time Martin recounted the shooting . <P> Martin ignored a subpoena to appear before a grand jury on Aug. 11 , and then hatched a more outlandish version of what had happened : a black-masked member of " the Guardian Angels of the Underworld " had carried out the ambush to prevent him from exposing the satanic cult . On Aug. 17 , Martin ducked another grand jury appearance-for his own safety , he said . <P> A few days later Martin 's cousin , Charles Goff , 29 , swore to police that he not only fired the shots , but also made three threatening telephone calls to a Martin aide to bolster the satanic cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stereo cabinet in his mother 's house and arrested him on an old assault charge . Free on bail , Martin denies everything . The grand jury will hear more evidence this week . If Martin is charged , it will probably be with a misdemeanor . Two possibilities : reckless conduct and making a false statement to police . <P> " This is a ridiculous saga , " Martin concedes . " I can hardly believe it myself . If the court says I am guilty , then I do n't want them to put me in jail . I want them to put me in the nuthouse . " Major Don Doyle of the Austin police department agrees : " Nobody wants to send the dumb s.o.b . to the penitentiary. "
