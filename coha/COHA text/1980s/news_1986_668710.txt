This clean , prosperous sugar-mill town on the southern peninsula did not look very different from a week ago when it was under the rule of President- for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier . But youths are no longer milling around angrily . At the Holy Cross Hospital , the American medical director , David McNeelly , is spending more time in the maternity ward than patching up bullet holes that were fired by the now-disbanded Duvalier militia called Ton Ton Macoutes . Most have turned in their weapons or disappeared . The troubles , however , are not yet over . Four people were badly beaten by the Ton Ton Macoutes hiding in the mountains on Tuesday . McNeelly said he spent six hours stitching up the head of a fifth man he says was " chopped up like a coconut " by a machete-wielding Ton Ton Macoute . In Leogane , population 5 , 000 , as in much of this desperately poor nation , the troubles began over economic issues . The field workers of Leogane were weary of going to the Dominican Republic , across the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . They began protesting . " On Jan. 31 , all of the people , like one man , just rose up , " recalled Jacques Renauld , 35 , an engineer . They drove the Ton Ton Macoutes out of town one by one . The few who who stayed in the town remained in their boarded up homes . But several dozen returned every morning until Feb. 7 , when Duvalier fled the country . They would fire weapons in the air and intimidate the townspeople . Days before Duvalier left , the people sacked the homes of army Col. Samuel Jeremie and took his tractor and two trailors and triumphantly drove around town and over the mountains to the town of Beloc . Jeremie went to Port-au-Prince and , according to townspeople , returned with four truckloads of Ton Ton Macoutes and fired into a crowd . People in Leogane say more than 100 people were killed or wounded . Evidence of this is not conclusive but McNeelly did record a high rate of casualties being dragged in from the cane fields . Renauld recalled learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 4 a. m . Feb. 7 . He told a few relatives and then sat on the porch of his centrally located house and watched . " There were still some Ton Ton Macoutes walking with Uzis , " he said . " They didn ' t know what was happening . They tried to still have people afraid of them . " But people were no longer afraid and one by one throughout the morning the once-dreaded militiamen left town . By 7 : 30 a. m. the townspeople began shouting that the Ton Ton Macoutes were all gone . They went to the militia headquarters and found it abandoned . Paul Cellies , 32 , left his house for the first time in weeks . " I was scared to ride my bicycle even , " he said . " I just stayed home until then . " The townspeople made every Ton Ton Macoute they could find turn in his card , uniform and weapon . The card and dark blue uniforms were burned . The weapons were turned over to the army . The people cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they called Pere ( Father ) Roget . Antoine had a reputation for standing up to government and in this part of the country it is said that he is the only popularly elected official in the country since he would clearly be elected mayor under any democratic system . The people then went into the mountains and destroyed , stone by stone , a voodoo temple of the Duvalier family . A process of retribution is in progress . Friends of the old regime are being forced out of town . " Everyone who is evil is being weeded out of the Leogane population , " said Sanfort Emanuel . But the Ton Ton Macoutes are fighting back , raiding from the mountains , burning houses and attacking townspeople . Many of the people in Leogane do not think their troubles are over . They are uneasy about the new government that was installed this week . They say most of the Cabinet are Duvalier supporters . Renauld said : " There are many other people who can do the job . We are asking ourselves why Duvalier went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CAPTION : PHOTO : A member of ousted Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier ' s notorious militia , the Tontons Macoute , is escorted from an angry crowd at the Port au Prince airport .
