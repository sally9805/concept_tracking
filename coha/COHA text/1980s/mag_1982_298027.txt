More precious than precocious at age seven , the little charmer is already a veteran of several commercials and films ( Altered States ) , and this summer she is a star of the new smash movie E.T . But for Actress Drew Barrymore this line of work is a bloodline . So it was easy helping the U.S. Postal Service last week to introduce a commemorative stamp of her grandfather John Barrymore ( 1882-1942 ) , great-aunt Ethel ( 1879-1959 ) and great-uncle Lionel ( 1878-1954 ) . Even competing with the Great Profile , the left side Granddad preferred to have depicted , Drew effortlessly upstaged , or rather understaged , her famous forebears . The daughter of Writer and Actor John Drew Barrymore , 50 , Drew has also already learned how to get more lines : she talked with E.T . Director Steven Spielberg , who let her make up her own background dialogue . <P> As for Spielberg , 34 , he too was dealing with-and for-legends last week . Making a long-distance telephone bid of $60,500 to an auction at Sotheby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cinematic props , the symbolic sled Rosebud from Orson Welles ' masterpiece , Citizen Kane . It was the highest amount of money ever paid for a piece of movie memorabilia , but Spielberg was unfazed . " It would have been an insult , " he said , " if it had gone for only $20,000 " - the expected price tag . " Rosebud , " promises the hot hit-making director , " will go over my typewriter to remind me that quality in movies comes first . " <P> <P> When one is accused of homosexual practices by a belligerent member of the opposite sex , one 's spouse is likely to consider those fighting words . And Nancy Kissinger , 48 , did . Last winter when she was accompanying her husband to Boston , where he was to undergo heart-bypass surgery , a pro-nuclear energy activist named Ellen Kaplan accosted the couple at Newark International Airport , baiting Henry Kissinger with the question , " Do you sleep with young boys at the Carlyle Hotel ? " Quick as a flash , Nancy grabbed Kaplan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slugged ? " Though unharmed , Kaplan pressed assault charges . Last week Newark Municipal Court Judge Julio Fuentes pronounced Nancy 's reaction " spontaneous " and " somewhat human , " then found her innocent . " Justice has been done , " said Kissinger after the verdict . And his honor fairly defended . <P> <P> " I know you , I know you , " says the clownish John Styx , greeting an arrival at the gates of hell in Jacques Offenbach 's comic opera Orpheus in the Underworld . " You do look familiar , " replies the rubbery-faced Miss Public Opinion . He should ; Styx is being played by Sid Caesar , 59 , and Opinion by Imogene Coca , 73 , stars from 1950 to 1954 of Your Show of Shows , a TV comedy classic . This week , in a rare appearance together , they will be reprising many of their best bits with some singing and much mugging in four performances of Orpheus at the Opera Company of Boston . The idea was cooked up by Director Sarah Caldwell , 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloonfoolery during rehearsals . Though opera was regularly and hilariously parodied by Caesar and Coca , both profess to find the real thing " kind of scary , " in Caesar 's words . But not serious . " Wagner is serious . This is not serious . "
