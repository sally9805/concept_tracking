Interviewed in his Jerusalem office a day after his meeting with President Anwar el-Sadat in Alexandria , Mr. Begin appeared relaxed and calm , discussing a range of issues without any of the passionate arguments that have marked most of his public statements in recent months. // He expressed regret over the killing of civilians in the Israeli bombing of Beirut last month , calling it " a tragedy . " But he defended the attack , which was aimed at Palestinian headquarters in the Lebanese capital , as having been decisive in pushing the Palestine Liberation Organization to agree to a cease-fire along the Israeli border. // He chided the Reagan Administration for not sending Philip C. Habib , the special American envoy , back to the Middle East to pursue his effort to have Syria remove antiaircraft missiles from eastern Lebanon . Israel has threatened to destroy the missiles if they are not withdrawn . <> <> Significant Accord on Palestinians // Mr. Begin also said that his sessions with President Sadat , lasting a total of three hours over two days , had been most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of autonomy for Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. // Egypt suspended the talks after Israel enacted legislation last year reaffirming its often-stated claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital , including the Arab sector captured from Jordan in the 1967 war . " If you have a difference of opinion , " Mr. Begin said , " and admittedly we have a difference of opinion , and you negotiate , you may not reach an agreement . But if you don ' t negotiate , it is an objective impossiblity to reach an agreement . It means do nothing . And that wasn ' t good at all. " // The Egyptian-Israeli differences center on Mr. Begin ' s narrow definition of autonomy and his efforts to restrict the Palestinians ' self-rule to municipal and administrative matters , while Mr. Sadat advocates broader powers that the Israelis fear could evolve into an independent state . Mr. Begin reiterated his longstanding pledge to prevent the establishment of such a state , which he said would develop into a Soviet base. // On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yosef Burg , said in an Israel radio interview today that the autonomy plan would provide the Palestinians with " more than 80 percent of statehood , " and that the Palestinians should therefore seize the opportunity and join the talks . <> <> ' Don ' t Hurt Civilians ' // On the Lebanon issue , the Prime Minister made his strongest expression of regret to date over the civilian casualties caused when Israeli planes attacked targets in a heavily populated Beirut neighborhood July 17. // " I will not deny it , " he said . " There was a tragedy involved . Civilians were hurt . This is not our method of fighting , as you know , since the underground times . And especially when I became Prime Minister , every officer knows that I said , ' Whatever you do , don ' t hurt civilians. ' " // Mr. Begin said that he had once called in Maj. Saad Haddad , commander of Christian forces in southern Lebanon , who receive Israeli arms , and asked him to stop shelling the Lebanese towns of Tyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you orders , " he quoted himself as having told Major Haddad . " We know you , and we can not . We have influence with you , moral influence . But it is bad for your cause and for our cause. " // But in the case of Beirut , the Prime Minister said , the hardship of Israel ' s northern settlements , which were being hit day and night by artillery and rockets , gave him no choice . Another official said that an invasion and occupation were contemplated but rejected . <> <> Death Toll Claims Denied // Mr. Begin denied Lebanese claims that 300 civilians were killed in the attack on Beirut ; he said Israeli intelligence put the figure at between 60 and 80 . " The civilians were a tragedy , which I regret very much , " he declared . " I say so openly , I never denied it . But we hit them so hard in that operation , they were almost immobilized . I have a full list of the damage we did to them . I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Believe me , there was no option . If we wanted to stop it , there was no option . And we had to stop it . We had to stop it. " // Since the cease-fire , Mr. Begin and other officials reported , the Lebanese have rebuilt bridges that had been destroyed by Israeli planes , and the P.L.O. has moved new weapons and ammunition south . So far , aerial photography has spotted 18 Soviet-built 130-milimeter artillery pieces , some of them in range of Israel ' s northern town of Kiryat Shemona , which was hit hard during the July shelling. " // In a speech tonight to a delegation of the United Jewish Appeal , Mr. Begin said that the artillery pieces had been supplied directly by the Soviet Union. // When Israel agreed to the cease-fire , Mr. Begin said , the American negotiator , Mr. Habib , had been told that it would do so on the condition that the P.L.O. not introduce more heavy weapons . " From this point of view it is a violation , " the Prime Minister asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t get heavy weapons . " But would Israel attack the new emplacements ? // " No , " Mr. Begin said quietly . " As long as they are silent , we won ' t . If they should shoot , that is a different story . But as long as they don ' t shoot , we won ' t . As I said , we would like the ceasefire to go on indefinitely. " // Nevertheless , he expressed concern about the flagging diplomatic effort to remove Soviet-made SAM-6 antiaircraft missiles deployed by Syria in April. //
