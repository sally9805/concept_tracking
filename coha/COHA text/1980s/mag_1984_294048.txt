At 25 , Castro 's revolution has already reached middle age <P> It was hailed as an anniversary of popular triumph , but the subdued ritual that took place last week in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba looked more like an exercise in lonely defiance . As a chilly evening rain fell on the tiny colonial plaza of Cuba 's second-largest city ( pop . 360,000 ) , a crowd of 5,000 carefully selected guests waited patiently as the country 's aging revolutionary leadership filed into place on the carved wooden balconies of the venerable city hall . Soaked to the skin , the audience heard Army Chief Ral Castro declare all of Santiago a " hero of the republic " and bestow upon the city Cuba 's highest honor , the Order of Antonio Maceo . Then all eyes shifted to the central balcony , where President Fidel Castro , 56 , stood alone , his head bowed . Stepping to the lectern , Castro used words he had first uttered to a frenzied and much larger crowd from the same spot exactly 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The revolution begins now . " <P> Notably absent on this occasion was the kind of flamboyant improvisational rhetoric that Castro introduced to the world a quarter-century ago . The graying revolutionary jefe read from a prepared text for a mere 90 minutes-a brief span compared with the five-and six-hour Castro stemwinders of the past . In a detailed litany of the accomplishments of his Communist regime , Castro described Cuba 's socialist state as " the most advanced political and social system known in the history of mankind . " <P> With that , Castro launched into venomous language to describe the No. 1 enemy of his revolution and , in his view , of mankind : the Reagan Administration and U.S. " imperialism . " The U.S. leadership , said Castro , is composed of " new Nazi-fascist barbarians , blackmailers by nature , cowardly , opportunistic and calculating like their Hitlerian predecessors . " The Reagan Administration , he charged , is pushing the world toward nuclear holocaust . Citing in particular the deployment of new U.S. medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe , Castro declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " necessary and just response " from Cuba 's main ally , the Soviet Union . <P> Above all , Castro singled out the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada . Referring to the 24 Cubans who died in the invasion , Castro declared to loud applause that " the blood shed by the heroic collaborators who fell in Grenada will never be forgotten . " Nor , he said , would the Cuban revolution " tremble or vacillate " should the time come to defend itself . Harking back yet again to the Santiago triumph of 1959 , Castro invoked the " heroism , patriotism and revolutionary spirit " of that day to achieve the same aim : " Victory . "
