txt // Crazy Quilt To make a crazy quilt , empty all the fabric scraps from your ragbag . The scraps may be of any color or size . If you prefer that your quilt be washable , choose pieces that are colorfast and will shrink minimally . Iron them so that they are . smooth and wrinkle free . Then group the scraps as to light and dark shades . From some soft , loosely woven material , like muslin or cambric , cut a block sixteen inches square for a foundation . A full-sized quilt will require twenty such foundation blocks . For sewing , use a short needle 11/8 inches in length and white thread ( # 50 or #60 ) , which is stronger than colored thread and tends to knot less . Baste a 16-inch-square block of cotton or dacron batting to the foundation block . Dacron will make a fluffy quilt filling . Bulky to work with when fine stitching is required , it is particularly suitable for a crazy quilt , which does not call for delicate sewing . Batting can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap on the batting in one corner . Fold under the edges on the sides bordering the edges of the block , and baste them in place . Repeat this procedure in the other three corners . Complete the block by placing patches with two basted edges on the unbasted edges of those patches already in the block . Begin in a corner . Working from left to right , use a hemming stitch to sew the patches in place . Produce a pleasing effect by choosing colors that harmonize or make an interesting contrast of light and dark hues . When the entire block is filled in , cover all patch seams with yarn . Use a simple embroidery stitch . After all twenty blocks have been completed with patches of varying shapes and colors , it is time to " set " your quilt . First , sew the blocks in rows . Since your quilt will be four blocks wide and five long , you may make either four rows of five blocks each or five rows of four blocks each . Now sew the rows together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of alternate blocks with decorative stitches . Finish your quilt by binding the three layers ? patches , batting , and foundation ? with bias tape purchased in a ' store or with bias strips you have cut yourself . You may make the bias strips from material that contrasts with the quilt or repeats a predominant color in it . Homemade binding is usually sturdier than store-bought tape . // Puffed Quilt Making a puffed quilt is simple . Each puff is a square of velvet ( you will find cotton velvet easier to use than slippery rayon velvet ) or silk sewn to a muslin square and stuffed with batting . The puffs are then sewn together . A quilt of any size can be made by this method . Cut 3-inch squares of velvet or silk ( here 's a chance to put those discarded or out-of-date silk ties to use ) and 21/4-inch squares of muslin . Putting the wrong sides of the material together , pin the corners of the velvet or silk squares to those of the muslin squares . Pleat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and pin in place to the muslin . Through the fourth side , fill the puff with batting . Pleat this side and pin it in place . Baste around all sides . Stitch close to the edge . Keeping the velvet-silk sides facing , and allowing for a 1/4-inch seam , sew the puffs together . Then iron the seams open and make rows of either the desired width or length of the quilt . Line the puffed quilt with some plain soft material . Finally , tack it on the back at regular intervals and catch the seams under the squares so that no tacking shows on top . RUGS Braided Cloth Rug Before attempting to make a braided cloth rug , try a small sample one . In this way you will learn to do even work and to properly calculate the amount of needed materials . A larger rug may then be designed more accurately , insuring satisfac-tory results . Assemble the following equipment and materials : 12 ( or more ) straight pins a few large safety pins 1 large needle for stitching braids or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacing them 1 smaller needle for splicing strips scissors cloth strips , from 1 to 6 inches wide , the width depending upon the weight of the material and the intended rug design Be sure all cloth is clean and well ironed . Roughly nine // ounces of fabric are needed for each square foot of a braided rug . Do not mix materials that have different degrees of shrinkage or varying rates of wear . If you are using old cloth , remove any weak areas . Cut the material into even strips . When the material is of different weights , the width of strips should be relative to the thickness of the cloth . ( Best results are obtained , however , when all the cloth is of uniform weight . ) Cut thin cloth in 6-inch widths , medium cloth in 3-inch widths , and heavy cloth in 21/2-inch widths . It is wise to use woven , rather than knitted , material . Because the warp is sturdier than the weft , strips should be cut lengthwise on the material . For easy handling , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strips in half lengthwise , and iron them with their raw edges turned in . To obtain a pleasing proportion of colors in a rug , arrange and rearrange the bundles of materials on the floor until the desired effect is reached . Put three or more cloth strips on a safety pin ? or fasten them to something stationary ? for braiding . You could anchor the strips by closing a window on them . Begin with the lefthand strip . Bring it over the second one and under the third . If your braid is composed of more than three strips , continue in the same manner , placing the strip over the fourth strand and under the fifth . Eventually , you will learn to braid from both sides . Maintain an even braid by folding the outer strip as it is brought back rather than pulling it around as you would with a round cord . When nearly at the end of a strand , attach another by opening it out , cutting a bias at its end and the end of the new one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to each other in the same braid . Your first braid is the central one . Its length should equal the difference between the width and length of the completed rug . For example , a rug that 's 36 inches by 48 inches would have a central braid of 12 inches . Indicate the center of your rug by attaching a safety pin at the starting point . In this way you can gauge whether you have an identical number of braided rows on each side and at each end . In an oval rug , turn the end of the central braiding by easing it around and along its side . Avoid cupping . You can do this by pulling the inside strip a bit at the turn and stretching the outside one . When the opposite end is arrived at , the tips of the braid should be fastened in place with pins . The lengths of the parallel braids may then be sewed together . // In an oblong rug , the corners must be turned at each round . When flat strips are used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip of a braid to the point of turning back , over , and then under the other strips parallel to it . Follow the same procedure with the other strips ; then commence braiding as for the straight braid . In the case of round strips , turn corners by easing the tension of the outside ones and drawing up the inside ones . Sew the contiguous sides of the braids together with a slip stitch or blind stitch ; the stitching should not be visible on either side . While sewing , keep the rug flat on a table top to maintain its proper shape . After sewing one side of the rug , braid as far as the next turn . Then sew the braid in place . By alternately sewing and braiding for only short distances , you 'll find it easier to prevent cupping and make the braids fit smoothly together . Add new color while working by fastening a new color , one strip at a time , to the braid . The most favorable effect is achieved when each series of a braid color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , rectangular stripe in an oblong rug . The border may be composed of colors located in the middle of the rug , but will be more interesting if they are of either brighter or darker hues . The size of the border will vary in proportion to the size of the rug 's center according to the vividness of its color . As your rug nears completion , especially when it is a large one , you may want to transfer it to the floor to keep it perfectly flat as you work . When the rug has reached its planned dimensions , check for an even number of braids on all sides . Now snip the final braid at the rug 's curve . Insert the ends of the braid beneath the last braiding row and pull it into shape , making the two oval rug ends match . Cut the ends of the last braid at uneven lengths so that they terminate at different places . Sew the ends of the strands firmly to the rug 's edge . For a stronger rug , you may fasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bodkin or safety pin for lacing . Thread the bodkin with a strip of material , or fasten the strip to a safety pin . Starting at the turn , lace the braids together . Do this by first sewing the tip of the lacing material to the braid . Now push the threaded bodkin or safety pin through the first loop on the side of the braid on the left , then over to the adjacent braid , and through the first loop on its side . Keep the lacing strand flat by folding it as it turns from loop to loop . // After aligning the braid loops , push the bodkin downward through the left loop , fold it back , and push it up through the right loop . Fold back once more and again pass the bodkin down through the left and up through the right side , thus lacing the two braid lengths together . Continue to braid and lace until the rug is completed . At the turns , extra lacing stitches will be required to avoid cupping . Instead of a strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin cord for a different effect . Crocheted Rug Crochet a low-cost rug quickly and easily by using fabric from cheap , secondhand clothing and a large crochet needle . Explore resell shops and rummage sales for bathrobes , coats , and wide-skirted dresses with plenty of material in them . Whittle your crochet needle from a 3/4-inch-thick wooden dowel , and smooth it with sandpaper . Rip the garments into strips . Avoid having to sew short strips together by tearing the cloth one way to within 1/2 inch of the end ; then reverse your direction and tear the opposite way . The kind of cloth determines the width of the strips . Those of cotton should be at least two inches wide ; wool strips can be one inch in width . You wo n't need to hem them if you turn under the raw edges as you work . Begin the rug with three chain stitches , and continue with a single crochet stitch in concentric circles . Occasionally , when the rug 's edges start to curl up , make two single crochets in one stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sew or tie on another . Keep loose ends on the underside . WAYS WITH CLAY ADOBE BRICKS Adobe is derived from a wide variety of clayey soils , heavy in texture and composed of very fine grained material . The name designates the sun-dried bricks , the clay of which they are composed , and structures built of the stuff . The word adobe comes from the Spanish adobar , to plas-ter . Its use as building material is said to have originated in northern Africa centuries ago . From there it was introduced into Spain . Not long after the discovery of America , Spanish conquerors brought the method to dry areas of the New World . Indians of Arizona and New Mexico began making adobe as early as the 1500 's . Adobe making is an uncomplicated procedure . Put sim-ply , correct proportions of sand and suitable clay are combined and wet down , a small quantity of some fibrous material is added , and the whole is mixed thoroughly either in a machine or with bare feet . // Ingredients of Adobe Brick Mix The chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waterproofing substance . The sand acts as filler ; the clay is the binder . Adobe brick mix generally contains more sand than clay . Clay content should be greater than 25% but less than 45% . Too little clay makes the dry bricks weak and crumbly ; too much clay causes cracking as the bricks dry . * SAND : Use sharp , coarse sand . If no natural sources of such sand are available , it can be purchased from a building supply company . ( Avoid sand from ocean shores because of its salt content. ) * CLAY . Although many types of clay are usable in making adobe , one of high kaolin content is preferable . Such material not only is less sticky to handle than others , but also results in stronger bricks . To learn the location of kaolin clay deposits , consult local geologists or those connected with government offices , such as the Division of Mines and Geology . * STRAW The incorporation of straw in the mix causes the drying brick to shrink as a unit , thus preventing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material in four-inch lengths . Straw can be bought at feed stores . Avoid using hay , if possible . * STABILIZER ( waterproofing substance ) : Use emulsified asphalt as a waterproofing agent , or stabilizer , so that the bricks will absorb only a small , safe percentage of water . ( A stabilizer is required by the Uniform Building Code when adobe bricks are intended for construction of any type of building . ) The liquid is available from road-paving companies or oil dealers . If your bricks are to be used for outdoor walkways , garden walls , porch floors , and the like , Portland cement added to soil will produce strong bricks that will not be harmed by water . They will be very hard but not waterproof . ( Bricks of this type would not comply with building code requirements and must not be used for inhabited structures . ) Use 15% cement , and insure that it cures properly by keeping the bricks damp for several days . // Soil Testing Test the suitability of soil for adobe ? brick making in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sod , and other organic matter from a small area of the test site . * Dig a hole as deeply as you intend to go when excavating for soil . Mix the dirt removed from the hole so that all layers of earth are well blended . * Put 8 ounces of the soil sample in a one-quart jar , and fill it with water . Add a teaspoon of table salt to speed settling of the clay . Shake the jar well , and let the contents settle for one hour or until the water is clear . * Examine the jar 's solid contents . You will see successive layers : lowermost will be small bits of rock ; next will be sand , varying from coarse at the bottom to particles of silt size ; the top layer will be clay , characterized by no perceptible particles . Rub some clay between your fingers . It should feel rather like soap and be free of grit . * To determine clay ? sand proportions , measure the height of the clay layer and estimate its percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers . Clay material must range between 25 and 45% . When the soil test indicates an excess in either clay or sand , you can procure high-clay soil or sand at a building materials outlet . Mix in the proper amount to correct whichever is deficient . Making Test Bricks If the soil tests properly , make a stiff mud with some of it and form several bricks of full size . Dry a few in the sun ; dry others in shade . By so doing , you can determine which drying conditions are most favorable . Cracks will appear within the first few days if they are going to occur . A high degree of cracking can be remedied by shading the bricks or by adding more straw or sand . Once the adobe drying test proves satisfactory , shape bricks that include emulsified asphalt to judge how much of it will be required . // Testing to Stabilize Bricks * Fill a 1-cubic-foot box with loose soil that has already been tested and found acceptable for use . Record the number of shovelfuls required to fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoe in sufficient water to form stiff mud . * Gradually pour in 1/2 gallon of emulsified asphalt while continually blending it with the mud . Mix the whole thoroughly until you can no longer discern any asphalt . ( A half-gallon of asphalt to 1 cubic foot of soil is a good ratio. ) * Shape the test bricks from the mud by hand . Make them some convenient size , perhaps 2 by 3 by 4 inches . * Dry these bricks in a warm oven to shorten the drying time , which would be much longer in the sun . * Immerse one of the dry bricks in water for a few hours . No softening should result , even at the edges . If softening does occur , repeat the test but this time use more stabilizer . Even though test results are good , follow the procedure again to determine if using less emulsified asphalt will bring equally satisfactory results . * After determining the stabilizer-soil ratio , you can estimate what amount is needed for each mixer load according to the soil capacity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a bit more emulsified asphalt than the minimum required in testing , since conditions may alter somewhat during production . Always allow sufficient time for the stabilizer to thoroughly mix with the mud . Molds Make your molds from Douglas fir lumber . Besides being a strong wood , it holds screws and nails better than redwood or pine . Use fine-grained , finished wood . Rough lumber is difficult to separate from the wet bricks . Molds range in size from eight inches square and two inches thick to two yards long , one foot wide , and 6 to 8 inches thick . However , the standard dimensions for an adobe brick are 4 by 71/2 by 16 inches . So that the finished brick will be four inches thick , make the mold depth 4N inches to compensate for slight sagging of the mud as the mold is removed and to allow for some shrinkage during drying . Cut four boards of the proper size and waterproof them . // For a stronger mold , fasten the boards with wood screws instead of nails . Reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Countersink them so that they are flush with the wood 's surface . At each end of the form , add wooden rectangles of a convenient size to serve as handles . Tack a thin metal strip on the top edges of the form to prevent wear as your trowel scrapes away excess mud after the mold has been filled . For ease in separating the mold from the mud , either line the form with a thin sheet of tin or make the mold 's bottom 1/16 inch wider on each side . Making Adobe Bricks Necessary Equipment : * rectangular mason 's trowel * wooden molds * pick ( for hard earth ) * 2 shovels : a pointed one for digging soil ; a square one for shoveling mud * deep wheelbarrow * containers for the stabilizer * buckets * large drum for storing water * mechanical mud mixer equipped with paddles ( A dough , plaster , or pug mixer works well ; a concrete mixer is not satisfactory . ) This piece of equipment is essential if your bricks are intended for any type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For other purposes not requiring a stabilizer , the ingredients can be deposited in a pit and trampled and mixed with your bare feet . * casting surfaces : You can cast bricks on flat ground , but a smooth surface is preferable . Use boards or scrap plywood supported on a framework of two-by-fours. * shading material : If you plan to dry bricks out of the sun , provide shade with plywood supported several inches above the bricks . // Mixing Break up any dirt chunks , and thoroughly mix the soil during excavation to create a homogeneous blend of the various layers of earth . Speed the breakdown of hard , stubborn clay masses by wetting the soil and keeping it covered with a sheet of plastic . Now multiply the previously noted shovelfuls ( required to fill the 1-cubic-foot box ) by the cubic-foot capacity of the mixer . This quantity will be shoveled into the machine as you charge it . To mix the mud , turn on the mixer and add most of the estimated amount of water required . Put in the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the paddles have beaten all lumps from the mud , gradually add the correct quantity of emulsified asphalt . Allow several minutes for this to be thoroughly mixed in . Lastly , add the straw . When it has been introduced , the mixer will labor due to the mud clotting and creating more resistance to the paddles . If left in too long , the straw tends to wrap about the paddles ; therefore , just as soon as it is evenly dispersed throughout the mud , discharge the mixer 's contents into a wheelbarrow . Casting Sprinkle the casting surface with sand or straw to keep the mud from adhering to it . Immerse the mold in water to avoid sticking ; place it on the prepared casting surface . Fill the form with mud , making sure the corners are completely filled . Press the mud in with your hands . Using your trowel , strike the mold 's contents even with its top . Now slowly and evenly lift the form from the fresh adobe brick . It is not necessary to let the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating each adobe brick , plunge the mold into a tub of water to clear off any bits of clinging mud . Then proceed with making the next brick . Drying and Curing Bricks Freshly created adobe bricks must be allowed to dry evenly . During the initial four days , protect them from rain or foggy , cold weather with a sheet of scrap plywood supported // several inches over them . Leave the ends open to the wind for further drying . Mild spring days are most favorable for the drying process . When the weather is hot , dry , and windy , however , hang burlap bags over the edges of the plywood protectors to avoid cracking caused by dry winds . After four days set the bricks on one side to promote rapid , even drying . From this time on , the plywood protector will not be needed . Let the bricks dry in the sun for six weeks . The molds , when not in use , should be kept in a container of water to prevent their drying out , warping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good protective covering for adobe walls , both inside and out , is linseed oil . Apply three brush coats . These may be followed by two coats of household paint for interior walls . Inside walls can also be treated by first applying waterproof glue . Make it of one part quicklime , six parts cottage cheese , and enough water to create a smooth-flowing mixture . Over this primer coat of glue , apply buttermilk paint : 1 gallon of buttermilk to 41/2 pounds of white cement . POTTERY Clay Sources The amateur potter may buy commercial clay directly from a pottery supplier . He will advise you on the clay best suited to your purpose . It will have proper consistency and texture and already have been subjected to necessary tests , particularly firing . An alternative is to dig and prepare the clay yourself . Clay so obtained will be just as good as commercial clay , cost nothing , and provide you with adventure while seeking it plus satisfaction in literally creating your pottery from start to finish . Likely sources are pond or stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brick or pottery works . If you fail to find clay through your own efforts , consult a surveyor or local builder . In most states a published geological survey is available that offers tips on locations of clays . // Preparation of Clay Two kinds of commercial clay may be bought , either of dry body or plastic body . Clay of dry body comes in powder form and has to be mixed with water for a very considerable time . Clay of plastic body has already been prepared and is ready for use . Clay you have dug yourself will probably require preparation , though some can be used as is . Others , being too soft , too hard , or full of vegetable matter , stones , and other impurities , will require special treatment : * First , let the clay dry thoroughly . * Then break it into walnut-sized pieces . * Soak them in a pail of water . * Let the clay soak for one to two days until it becomes a thick slop . The slop will remain as a sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top . * Blend the clay and water in the pail to make a thin slop . With your hands or a stiff brush , pass the material through a fine garden sieve into a second pail to eliminate undesirable impurities. * Let the slop settle once more . During the settling , water can be poured off little by little , and the thickening clay will stay on the pail 's bottom . If the clay is needed urgently , it can be spread on a cloth to dry more quickly outdoors . When clay is not needed immediately , however , the ideal way is to let it dry naturally through evaporation until the proper consistency for modeling is reached . This would require several weeks . If the clay lacks sufficient plasticity , combine it with some bought clay by making alternate layers of both and kneading them together . Storing Clay Clay of ideal consistency , neither so soft as to stick to the hands nor so hard as to be unyielding to the touch , should be stored to maintain it in this condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of metal , which develop rust , although the rust has no adverse effect on the clay . To insure that the clay is kept free from air , cover it with a plastic sheet or damp sack . Check it often for drying . If suitable containers are not available , closely wrap the clay in a plastic sheet . Unfinished clay work must also be kept free // from air to prevent hardening . Wrap objects in plastic bags or sheets Slip Slip is clay thinned to the consistency of cream . It is used for binding sections or coils of clay together . Make it by soaking pieces of clay in water until they become refined slop . Sieve it through an 80- or 100-mesh sieve , obtainable from a pottery supplier or lumberyard . Wedging and Kneading To prevent the explosion of clay articles during firing , trapped air must be expelled from the clay . This is done through wedging and kneading home-prepared clay . Bought clay will not require such treatment . Wedge the clay by cutting it into thick slices and forcefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Form them into a mass again , and repeat the procedure ten to twenty times . Knead the clay by pressing down on it with the base of your palms and pushing it from the body . Lifting the farthest edge of the clay , bring it over and toward you , and then press down again with the palms . The clay has been sufficiently kneaded when a cross section , cut by a wire , shows close , even texture without air pockets . Clay that is to be fired in a primitive kiln must be strengthened with sand . Slice the clay , and make alternate layers of it and the sand . Then knead them together . Since sand tends to dry clay , you may need to put a thin layer of slop between each clay slice . Use one part sand to two or three of clay . Techniques of Pottery Making * PINCH TECHNIQUE : Shape a chunk of clay ( the size of a small orange ) in your hands as if shaping a snowball . When a smooth ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thumb of your other hand into its center , thus making a deep hole . Now you have the beginnings of a pot with thick walls . Still cupping the clay in your palm , pinch the wall between // thumb and fingers , with the thumb inside and the fingers outside . Slowly rotating the pot in your hand , very gradually pinch out all sides of the pot and gently ease the clay . If cracks begin to appear as you are working , smooth over them with a wet finger . * COIL TECHNIQUE : Roll clay backward and forward beneath your fingers to form long coils . A beginner should make the coils somewhat thick ? approximately the diameter of a fountain pen . Although it is not essential , try to keep them fairly uniform in length and thickness . Flatten a sphere of clay into a disc roughly as thick as the coils . This is the pot 's base . Now start the coiling . Shape the first coil around the inner edge of the disc , and press the coil 's inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle , guide it around on the top of the primary coil , pressing it firmly in place by smearing the inner edge down on the coil under it . Continue this procedure , coil upon coil , until the pot is finished . Control its shape by the placement of the coils . If you want the pot to swell out , place the coils on the outer edge of the coil below . If the pot is to be narrower , place the coils on the inner circumference . To join the ends of coils , simply smear one against the other . After a wall of seven to ten coils has been built up , permit the clay to become a bit firm in order to prevent sagging when the weight of more coils is added . Generally , one hour is needed for the clay to firm up sufficiently . If the clay overhardens , soften the top coil by scoring it and applying thick slip until it acquires the same consistency as the new coils . * SLAB TECHNIQUE : With the slab technique , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rolling pin ( or a section of broom handle , a bottle , or a metal pipe ) , roll out a lump of clay into a flat sheet or slab of the desired thickness . Rolling should be done on a piece of cloth or paper to keep the clay from sticking to the work surface . Clay for the slab technique should be just a bit firmer than that for pinch or coiling work . If it is too soft , allow time for it to harden slightly . Slabs can be cut into tiles with a knife and decorated with pictures that are incised or impressed on their surfaces . Containers can also be made . For example , to make a round pot , first cut out the base . Then mark it by outlining on the clay some circular object of suitable size . Holding a table knife vertically , cut around the outline . Then cut a long , narrow strip // to form the side . Score all edges to be joined with a matchstick or modeling tool . Paint the scored edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together securely without scoring and slipping . Stand the narrow strip on its side around the inside circumference of the base ; attach it by firmly pressing the pieces together and smoothing over the joinings with a tool . Clay slabs may be wrapped around cardboard tubes of various lengths . Remove the tube as soon as feasible . A disc of appropriate size cut from a slab forms the base . Make a simple dish by pinching up the edge of a circular slab . Any number of articles found about the house ? plates , bowls , cardboard boxes , etc. ? can be utilized as molds in slab work . Roll out a slab of clay a little larger than the selected mold . Using a damp sponge , gently press the clay , still on its cloth ( to prevent sticking ) , into the mold . Cut away excess clay . Hold the clay down in the mold while cutting in case it should stick to the knife and be pulled out . With a damp sponge , smooth off the rim of the receptacle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloth . Decorating While a finished clay article is yet in its soft , plastic stage , it can be decorated by impressing . Experiment by pressing small objects on the clay to make interesting patterns . In slab work , the design may be pressed on with the clay still in sheet form , prior to building up the final shape . Relief decorations ? small clay pieces applied to the object 's surface-are pressed on while the clay is soft . If the clay is not soft enough , score and coat the surfaces to be bonded together with slip ( a small brush is handy for this ) . Clay surfaces can be decorated by incising . The clay should be almost completely dry . Experiment with simple tools to scratch , score , or carve . Kilns and Firing The beginner can fire his pots in a simple , homemade sawdust kiln . Select a kiln site where the ground is free of vegetation and well away from buildings . Collect dry fuel ? wood shavings , twigs , wood ? the amount depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay a groundwork of shavings and twigs . Cover this with a 3- to 4-inch layer of sawdust . Fill the articles to be fired with sawdust . Place a layer of pots , 2 inches apart , in the bed of sawdust . Be sure the articles do not touch each other and are not too close to the edge of the foundation . Cover the pots with a layer of sawdust . Continue to build alternating layers of pots and sawdust . The complete mound should then be thickly covered with sawdust , followed by shavings , twigs , and wood . The purpose of the foundation of shavings and twigs and the outer layer of the same materials is to ignite the sawdust . The firewood will burn strongly for about ten minutes and then die out . The sawdust , once lit , will smoulder for quite some time . Sudden changes in temperature would cause the pots to explode . However , the temperature within your kiln will rise gradually because of the slowly burning covering of sawdust . As the sawdust is consumed , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Depending on the kiln 's size , firing time will last anywhere from twelve to twenty-four hours . When the pots are cool enough to be lifted from the kiln , wash or brush them clean . Firing of clay articles can also be done in a metal drum with holes pierced around its sides . Fill it completely with dry sawdust . The articles should be dispersed throughout the sawdust . Light the fire from the top . It will slowly smoulder downward and require no additional attention . There are small electric kilns on the market that have been designed for testing purposes . If firing out of doors is not feasible , small objects can be fired indoors in such a kiln . Should these first attempts at pottery-making spur you to work on a larger scale , a more sophisticated kiln may be constructed . TANNING HIDES AND FUR SKINS Time and patience are the initial requirements for tanning hides and furs . Choose the hide and fur of deer and squirrel for your first attempts . They are more easily readied for tanning than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require greater skill in preparation to avoid damage . For all soaking and tanning operations , use a wooden , earthenware , or plastic container . Metal containers react with the salt and tanning chemicals . Preparations After skinning the animal , flesh the hide ; that is , remove all meat remaining on it . Be sure it is also free of blood and mud . Cutting from the skin side , trim any ragged edges . The hide is now ready for the tanning process , unless you plan to tan a deerskin into buckskin . In that case , the hair must first be removed . In 5 gallons of water , mix 5 quarts of hydrated lime . Leave the hide in this solution until the hair is easily pushed frorn the skin with your hand , generally between // six and ten days . Spread the hide on a board , and push off the remaining hair with the blunt side of a knife . Then work over both sides of the skin with the back edge of a knife . Hold it nearly flat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This is known as scudding . ) The remains of the liming process ? fleshings , limewater sludge , and lime ? can be put to good use as fertilizer because they are particularly suitable for acid soil . The hair , collected as it is removed from the hide and rinsed several times , can be utilized in plastering . After being washed thoroughly in repeated changes of water and dried completely , it is useful in padding , upholstery , and in the insulation of pipes . The body hair of deer is valuable for making the bodies of fishing flies . By adding a water-repellent dressing to the already naturally buoyant deer hair , dry flies can be fashioned that will remain afloat almost indefinitely . Without the protective dressing , a fly of deer hair will become soaked after a time and will serve only as a wet fly . Now soak the hide in clean water for five hours . Scud again . Fill a 10-gallon container with water . Stir in 1 pint of vinegar with a wooden paddle . ( You may substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave the hide in this mixture for twenty-four hours to halt the action of the lime . Then proceed with tanning . Tannage Procedures * SALT AND ALUM TANNAGE : Prepare the salt-alum solution by dissolving 1 pound of ammonia alum ( or potash alum ) in 1 gallon of water . In another container , dissolve 8 ounces of salt and 4 ounces of washing soda in 1/2 gallon of water . Slowly empty the salt-soda solution into the alum solution , while stirring rapidly . Immerse a clean skin in this solution for two to five days ? according to its thickness . Due to the effect of alum on certain furs , it might be advisable , in general , to apply the tanning solution in paste form , and only on the flesh side . Gradually , add flour mixed with a little water to the tanning solution until a thin paste forms . Blend well to avoid lumps . Spread the skin smoothly and tack it , flesh side out . Completely coat the skin with the paste to a thickness of approximately 1/8 inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second coat . Thick skins will require an addiOILING // tional coating on the third day . The final coating should be left on for four days . Then scrape away the paste , wash the skin in 1 gallon of water with 1 ounce of borax , and rinse in fresh water . Lay the skin out on the board and , using a dull edge , press out much of the water . Proceed with oiling and finishing . * ALCOHOL AND TURPENTINE TANNAGE : Tannage with alcohol and turpentine is easiest for a small fur skin . Mix 1/2 pint each of wood alcohol and turpentine in a widemouthed gallon jar having a screw-on lid . Put in the small fur skin . Since alcohol and turpentine tend to separate , shake or stir the solution daily . After a week to ten days , take out the skin . Wash it in detergent water , removing grease , alcohol , and turpentine . Rinse thoroughly several times to get rid of the detergent . Squeeze water from the skin without wringing . When it is partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Finishing Allow the tanned , wet leather to dry somewhat . While it is yet fairly damp , apply a coat of sulfated neat's-foot oil . The amount of oil will vary according to the natural oiliness of the skin . For example , a racoon skin , being normally more fatty than a deerskin , would require less oil . For a 10-pound deerhide , the following solution is recommended : In 31/2 ounces of warm water , mix a like amount of sulfated neat's-foot oil with 1 ounce of ammonia . Lay the skin , hair side down , on a smooth surface . Evenly spread one half of the mixture over the hide with your hand or a paint brush . Wait thirty minutes . Then apply the remainder in the same manner . Cover the hide with a plastic sheet . Keep it covered overnight . If several skins have been coated , stack them , flesh sides together , overnight . The next morning hang the skin , fur side out , over a sawhorse to permit drying of the hair . Then nail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretch it slightly . Hammer the nails ( no. 6 finish ) 1/2 inch in from the edge , spaced about 6 inches apart . The flesh side should be dried at room temperature . While the skin is still slightly damp , stretch it from corner to corner . Work the flesh side over some wooden edge , such // as a chair back . Achieving a soft skin depends on repeatedly working it while it is in the process of drying . When softening and drying are complete , give the skin a quick bath in unleaded or white gasoline to deodorize it and remove any excess grease . ( Do this outdoors , away from flame or fire . ) Clean and brighten the pelt by tumbling it again and again in warm , dry , hardwood sawdust . Shaking , beating , and brushing will clean sawdust particles from the fur . If need be , you may smooth the flesh side with a sandpaper block . Also , this will further soften the skin . Preservation of Pelts Unless tanning is to take place within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured to avoid deterioration . Preserve a small animal pelt by air-drying it . Tack it flat , hair side down , on a board . A large pelt must be salted immediately . Place it , flesh side up , on a smooth surface . Sprinkle the hide thoroughly with salt and work it into wrinkles , neck , legs , and cut edges . For every pound of hide , use 1 pound of salt . If you are curing more than one hide , lay one on top of another , hair side down , and thoroughly salt the flesh side of each . The surface on which the pelts are stacked should have a slight incline to aid drainage of any liquid from the pile . In two weeks you may hang the hides for complete drying . If salted a second time , they may be stored as late as May , but no longer . A cured skin must be softened prior to tanning by soaking it several times in a 5- to 10-gallon container of cool water . Renew the water for each soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . Some may require two hours ; others , more . As the skin starts to soften , spread it on a flat board . Begin scraping the flesh side with an old hacksaw blade to break up tissue and fat . To do a thorough job of removing the adhering tissue , you may need to alternately scrape and soak the hides . While scraping , take care not to damage the true skin . Now mix a solution of 1 ounce of borax or soda to every gallon of lukewarm water . You may also add soap . Put in the skin when it is just short of being soft . Stir it about with a // paddle . This procedure cleanses the skin , cuts grease , and induces the final softening . Again place the skin on a board , and scud it . Then rinse it well in lukewarm water . Press out the water without wringing the skin . Unless you intend to dehair it , proceed with the tanning operation as previously described . American Indians removed the hair from hides with wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make buckskin soft , weary jawed squaws laboriously chewed the hides . Though these methods are of interest , we feel sure you will prefer those already set forth . MAKING RAWHIDE Hide that has been taken as quickly as possible after the death of an animal is called " green hide " ; from it the best rawhide is made . First , stake out a green hide on the ground in some shaded spot for roughly two hours . To stake it properly , pull outward from the center before fastening it down . After two hours Nature will have changed it from green hide to rawhide , which should be sufficiently stiff to work with . Cut off any bits of hanging flesh . Using heavy shears , cut the hide in an oval or round shape , and remove legs , neck , and other projecting portions . Now cut the oval or disc into one continuous strip about 2% inches in width by scissoring around the circle until you reach its center . In thinner areas ( such as the belly ) , cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried it will shrink to approximately two-thirds of its original width . When rawhide is neither too dry nor too damp , it can be cut with ease . If the strip becomes difficult to cut due to excess dryness , dampen the hide somewhat . Attach one end of the long strip to a post , pull taut a section at a time , and grain off the hair with a keen-edged knife . Hold the blade almost flat . Guard against cutting the top skin ( scarf skin ) , which gives strength to the rawhide string . Once the hair has been removed , stretch the rawhide strip between posts or trees in complete shade . Leave it for five days to dry thoroughly . Then it will be ready for cutting into strings . Bevel rawhide strings on the hair side to prevent the sharp edges from curling up . If the rawhide strip or strings are to be softened , rub them well with saddle soap ( yellow laundry soap // is also effective ) and work them back and forth against a piece of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR LEATHER Fabricate a needle for sewing leather articles from the " key " used to open sardine cans . Straighten the handle end , and hammer and file ? or grind ? it to a point . Thread sewing material through the slot at the opposite end . PRESERVING AND MOUNTING SNAKESKINS Carefully skin the snake by centrally slitting the underside of the skin from top to bottom . If the snake is a rattler , take care not to disjoin the rattles . Using steel wool and borax , scrub the skin to remove all meat . Leave the skin overnight . The following day , paint both sides with a mixture of one-half wood alcohol and one-half glycerin . After twenty-four hours , paint on a second coat . The skin will now be pliable as well as durable . Select a board of interesting grain , saw it to the correct length , and finish it . Fasten the snakeskin on the board with any good glue . SHOE REPAIRS In olden times the shoemaker was itinerant , as were tinkers and other tradesmen . His kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to work , an awl , knives , pincers , handforged nails , a hammer , wax filched from beehives along the way , and sturdy , bark-tanned leather heavily impregnated with whale oil . The shoemaker was welcome in every home not only for his craft , but also for the " news " he dispensed . Ensconced in a chimney corner with his last , he would fashion new boots and shoes or repair old ones . However , a good many rural folks were often obliged to tan hides and make their own rough footwear , either for the sake of frugality or because the shoemaker 's calls were too infrequent . Whether for purposes of economy or the pure // satisfaction involved , you can repair your own boots and shoes by using these guidelines . Ripped Seams The repairing of ripped seams in shoe and boot uppers requires a very small outlay for tools and materials . You will need a kit of hand-sewing needles , which can be purchased inexpensively at any dime store or shop selling sewing supplies . The packet contains five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for a specific purpose . You will also need extra-strong thread , either the kind used over the years for sewing carpets and buttons or the more recently manufactured polyester-cotton-wrapped thread . Follow these steps to repair the seams in footwear : * Pull apart the seam until you meet with resistance . Stop at this point . Remove all old stitching with the help of a penknife. * Choose the proper needle from the kit . If your hand will fit behind the seam , a straight needle will be appropriate . If the seam is located close to the shoe 's toe , select the curved needle . * To sew a fine seam , use single thread . Use double or even triple strands of thread when the original holes in the leather are large enough . For a more water-resistant seam , first coat the thread with the wax from a beeswax candle . If beeswax is unavailable , ordinary candle wax will do . * Close the seam by sewing through the original holes . Take care not to enlarge them . Make the stitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final stitch several times ; a knot is unnecessary . To achieve a smooth finish , pound or rub the stitching into the leather . Attaching Leather Half Soles Sewing on new half soles will require a last , an item not as easily come by today as in the 1930 's and 40 's , but nonetheless available to the adventurous of spirit . Search secondhand stores and you may find one for a dollar or two . Antique shops are sometimes a source , but there a last would sell for considerably more . Made of metal , it resembles an inverted leg with a // foot ( for holding a shoe ) and is attached to a wooden base . In addition to a last , you will need clinching nails and an awl for making new holes in leather . Fashion one from a hardwood dowel of a size that fits comfortably in your grip . Drive a long , heavy nail perpendicularly through the center of the dowel , allowing a portion of the point to extend beyond the wood . Hammer this extension flat against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flatten the nail head with a hammer , and grind it to a smooth point with a coarse file . Follow this procedure for stitching on leather half soles : * Buy precut half soles , or purchase leather and cut your own . * Soak the half sole or leather piece for ten minutes in tepid water . This step will make cutting and sewing easier . Then wrap newspaper around the leather to absorb excess water . * If you 're making a sole , place the sole of the shoe on the new leather and trace around it . Carefully cut along the outline with a sharp knife . * Place the shoe on the last . With a penknife or razor blade , cut the old threads on the original half sole . Lift the sole and separate it from the shoe with a somewhat diagonal cut at the arch . * Bevel the half sole so that it slightly extends over what remains of the old sole . * Clinching-shoe nails range from % inch to 7/s inch in length . Choose one a half size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe . Hammer in about nine nails along the juncture of the new and old half soles . Next nail down the tip and sides of the half sole . * Using a sharp knife , trim the edge of the sole for neatness . * Cut a shallow depression or trough on the sole 's bottom where the stitching will be . Having the stitches slightly recessed protects them from wear . * With the old holes of the shoe welt ( a strip of leather sewn in the seam between the upper of a shoe and the sole to reinforce their joining ) to guide you , use the awl to make holes from the topside in the half sole . Every other hole will be enough . * Take a waxed strand of thread 3 feet long and thread two needles , one at each end of the thread . Begin at the first hole closest to the arch . Run the needles consecutively through the same opening , one needle in one direction and the second needle in the other direction . Sew such // opposing stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either sew the last stitch several times or make a knot . Snip off excess thread . * Complete your work by pounding down the depression made for the stitches in the sole . Rub all the needle holes , stitches , and cracks with beeswax or shoe polish . WAYS WITH WAX CANDLES Materials and Equipment For simple candlemaking , assemble the following materi als and equipment : PARAFFIN FLAKES : They can be bought in bags by the pound from a candlemakers ' supply shop . Paraffin wax is quite hard and makes a smooth-burning candle . BEESWAX : When a small amount of beeswax is added to the paraffin , the candle has a smooth finish , gives off the aroma of honey while burning , and drips only minimally . Small bees-wax discs can be purchased as an addition . STEA BIN ( sometimes known as sterene or stearic acid ) : This flaky white substance , when melted separately and added to the melted paraffin , facilitates the removal of the candle from the mold , gives it a harder finish , and prevents guttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stearin to 90% paraffin-beeswax mixture . It can be bought by weight at a candlemak ers ' supply shop . // * COMMON WHITE STRING : Use ordinary white string to make your wicks . Closely braid it in two or more strands according to the thickness desired . To achieve a smoothly burning wick , it is necessary to correlate the wick size with the candle size , particularly with its diameter . The bigger the candle , the bigger the wick . Experience will teach you to gauge the wick size correctly . Now make a solution of 8 ounces of water , 1 tablespoon of salt , and 2 tablespoons of borax . Soak the wicks in this mixture for about six hours . Then hang them up . Once they are completely dry , they will be ready for use . ( You may purchase ready-made wicks very reasonably . Most have a label indicating the diameter of the candle for which they are suited. ) * WAX-BASED DYE : If you care to color your candles , use commercial wax dyes . Buy them in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your candles is optional . Oilbased perfumes for wax are available at your supplier . * TWO OLD SAUCEPANS : One pan should be small enough to fit into the other . * SUGAR THERMOMETER : Measure the temperature of the wax with it . * SCISSORS : You will need a pair of scissors to cut and trim wicks. * PLASTICINE : Use this to keep melted wax from leaking through the wick hole in the bottom of the candle mold and to attach bases on bottomless molds. * KNIFE : Have a sharp one handy for evening the bottoms of candles and doing other small jobs . * CANDLE MOLD : Almost any container can serve as a candle mold as long as it has straight sides and a mouth with at least the same width as its base . You can probably find many appropriate containers in your kitchen ? vases , cups , mugs , and jugs . By exploring secondhand stores , you can often turn up interesting and inexpensive containers to use as candle // molds , and various types can be bought at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow for easy removal of the finished candle . Check this by oiling their interior and compactly filling them with Plasticine . If the " candle " of Plasticine slips out easily , the chosen container is acceptable as a mold . Copper and plastic piping provide excellent molds . Purchase off-cuts from a builders ' supply center . Making certain that they are perfectly level when standing on end , saw them to the desired length . Smooth the edges with fine sandpaper . Make notches opposite one another on the rim of the top to hold a skewer or pencil from which to hang the wick . Find a jar lid the size of the mold 's bottom ( or cut one from cardboard , plastic , etc . ) . Make a central hole in it for the wick , and seal its edges to the bottom of the mold with Plasticine. * WICK RETAINERS : These are metal discs for candle molds lacking wick holes . Fasten the wick to one and lower it into the bottom of the container . Wick retainers can be bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger of your saucepans one quarter full of water , and place it on a lighted stove burner . Bring the water to the boiling point . Put the required amount of paraffin wax in the smaller saucepan , and lower it into the hot water . Reduce the heat so that the water barely simmers , and let the wax melt . Cut wicking to correct lengths , somewhat longer than the molds ' height , and knot one end of each . Dip them in the melted wax and hang them until dry . Make sure your molds are absolutely clean . Then insert wicks in their bases , pulling the unknotted ends through the holes until the knot is firmly against the bottom . Carefully seal the hole with Plasticine . For molds without wick holes , use a wick retainer by attaching the wick to it and lowering it into the middle of the bottom . Now tie or tape the free end of a wick around a metal skewer or pencil placed horizontally and centrally across the opening of the mold . Be sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mold is not recessed , the wick knot will cause imbalance . Remedy this by placing your mold on an // improvised platform made of two slightly spaced wood blocks , bricks , or any objects of exactly the same height . When the paraffin has melted , add a small amount of the beeswax . Gently introduce it into the molten paraffin ; let it melt . In a separate pan , melt stearin in an amount equaling 10% of the total of the paraffin wax plus beeswax . Add the dye immediately if you desire tinted candles . When melted simultaneously with the wax dye , stearin imparts a more vivid color to the finished product . Tint the mixture a slightly lighter shade than is desired , since the finished candle , being denser , will be darker in color . Carefully spoon the tinted stearin into the paraffin ? beeswax mixture . Insert the sugar thermometer into the saucepan of wax . Check for the temperature to reach 180 ? F. At this point , take the container from the stove . Using a spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax mixture into a warm metal jug with a long spout ) , pour the wax very carefully into the candle mold at its center . Be sure to avoid wax drips on inner side surfaces . Then tap the mold to release air , thus preventing air bubbles from forming on the surface . Now let your candle set . Depending upon its size , this may require as many as twenty-four hours . During the setting period , " top up " the candle . As the candle sets , the wax will contract and a depression will appear around the wick . Fill in this hollow with leftover wax from the batch made up for your candles . At the first appearance of the depressed area , make several holes in the surface of the wax . As the candle firms up , pierce more holes and pour in melted wax until level with the surface . You may need to repeat this procedure three times before the surface hardens without forming a hollow . When your candle has shrunk from the mold 's sides , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wick from the skewer or pencil . Then , holding your hand over its mouth , invert the mold . Remove the Plasticine seal around the wicking knot . Cut off the knot with a sharp knife . Handling the candle delicately in order not to mar its surface , gently shake the candle from the mold . If the surface does not appear sufficiently smooth and shiny , hold on to the wick and dip the candle in boiling water and then ice water . Stand your candle upright . You may need to trim the wick with scissors . It should be about 1/4 inch in height . Cure the finished candle in a cool , dry place for three days before using it . // Candle in a Glass To make a candle that will remain in its glass container requires but one item in addition to the supplies already mentioned ? glue . Select some transparent glass container that is eye-catching . Make sure it is thoroughly clean . Wax a wick somewhat beyond the usual size appropriate for the container 's diameter . ( The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; therefore , a too-small wick would fall over and be extinguished . ) Turn a short span of the wick at a right angle , and glue it in the middle of the container 's bottom . Fasten it at the top in the customary way . Pour in melted wax that does not exceed 180 ? F. , or you will risk cracking the glass . Let the candle set , and top up in the usual manner . Try to achieve as smooth a surface as possible . Trim the wick to 1/4 inch . Your dripless candle in glass will need no other holder . Dipped Candles Fill a vessel with a prepared candle ? wax mixture . Choose one that is somewhat taller than the length of candle intended . Cut a wick about 3 inches longer than necessary . Completely soak the wick in the melted wax , and hang it to dry , keeping it as straight as possible . Tie the dry wick on the horizontal bar of a wooden coat hanger . Now add stearin to the wax ? about 20% for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the temperature of the wax is 160 ? F. , dip the suspended wick slowly into the wax . Be careful to hold the coat hanger as nearly on a level as possible . Leave the wick in the wax for approximately five seconds ; then slowly lift it out . Suspend the hanger from a hook located away from a wall , and let the taper dry for roughly two minutes . Continue dipping and drying until the taper reaches the desired thickness . Allow the candle to set hard , an hour or more , before cutting it from the hanger . Trim the base evenly with a sharp knife . More than one taper can be made at a time by using a // vessel with a wider mouth to hold the wax and by hanging more wicks on a longer rod which , after the dipping process , can be suspended across the backs of spaced chairs . Remember to place newspapers beneath the tapers to catch drips . OUTDOOR GEAR HAMMOCK You will need these materials to make an inexpensive hammock : * 25 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 10-foot piece of lumber , 1 by 3 inches * 12 11/2-inch wood screws * 1 piece of canvas , 21/2 by 7 feet Cut the wood into four 21/2-foot sections . Place each canvas end between two of the boards . To secure the canvas , insert six screws in each set of boards . Drill holes through the wood 3 inches in from the ends to accommodate the rope . Run the equal lengths of rope through the holes at either end , and knot them on the underside of the fastened boards . WALKING CANE The first step in making a walking cane should be taken in the woods . Explore the ground for a fallen branch that approximates the diameter of cane you have in mind . // Make the next stop a junkyard . Buy a rod of lightweight steel to reinforce your walking stick . Saw the chosen branch into cross sections about 1 Y2 inches in thickness . Bore out their centers , and string them on the steel rod . Glue each addition to the one before . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost anything that strikes your fancy ( the more unique the better ) will serve , provided it fits comfortably in your grip . GOLF TEES Purchase a polyethylene rod , 3/16 inch in diameter . Cut it in 2-inch segments . While holding one end of a segment with pliers , immerse the opposite end in boiling water . After a few seconds it will be soft . Press the softened end on a golf ball . It will expand slightly and become molded to the ball 's curve . Keep it against the ball for several seconds until cooling and hardening take place . Sharpen the other end in a pencil sharpener . TRUCKWAGON Cut four wheels by sawing 2-inch-thick cross sections of logs . The wheels may be of any desired size as long as all four diameters are similar ; a suggested satisfactory diameter is 12 inches . In the center of each wheel , bore a 2-inch hole to accommodate the axle hub . Make the axle from a hardwood pole , 30 inches long and 3 inches in diameter . If desired , the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim the ends of the hubs , and fit them in their holes so that they extend about 1 inch beyond the wheels . Bore a hole close to the end of each axle ; insert a peg to keep the wheel on the hub . Connect the axles with a narrow coupling board that runs from the center of the rear axle to the middle of the one in front . Bore a hole through the coupling board and front axle for a metal bolt , which will enable the front wheels and axle to rotate at almost 180 degrees . Bolt the rear axle in similar fashion , but do not allow it to rotate . Run short boards , as braces , at an angle from a position near the wheels on the rear axle to the coupling board . Secure the braces with bolts or pegs . If your truckwagon is intended for the fun of racing down // a hillside , fasten a board seat to the back axle and braces . Control direction by foot pressure on either side of the front axle or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the axle close to the wheels . If hauling is your truckwagon 's purpose , build a wagon bed at the rear instead of a seat , or nail on a good-sized wooden box . BOW SAW If you have an old bicycle-tire rim from a 26-inch wheel , a few scraps of wood , some nuts and bolts , and a metal rod on hand , you are well equipped for making a bow saw . The only expense involved ? from wooden dowels of a circumference to fit within the tire rim 's groove . One handle should be 16 inches long ; the other , 22 inches in length . Fasten the saw blade , its cutting edge lowermost , at one end of the 16-inch handle with a nut and bolt ; the free end of the dowel should project downward . Fasten the opposite blade end approximately at the 16-inch point on the other handle so that the lower ends of the dowels are on an even plane . Six inches of the longer handle should project above the back of the blade . Cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fit its groove around the inner side of the dowels , close to the blade 's cutting edge ; the arch of the bow should face downward . Run a metal rod along the groove of the arch and through holes bored in the handles . Secure the rod with nuts . It will create tension in the rim and pull the blade taut . When preparing stove or fireplace wood with your bow saw , grip the extension of the 22-inch handle . The bowed rim will act like a pendulum weight , keeping the saw blade vertical . If you need to cut a log that is too large to fit within the saw 's frame , the blade can easily be reversed . BACKPACK Make a roomy , serviceable backpack from an old pair of bib overalls . Simply knot each lower leg securely , and the pack is ready to be filled . Slip the suspenders over your shoulders . // OLD-FASHIONED LANTERN An old-fashioned lantern can be completed in no time with a few discarded materials . Begin with a 1-pound can , preferably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not at hand , almost any tin with a diameter of about 5 inches will serve as well ? a 1-pound lard can , a large tobacco tin , etc . From the bail of a paint can , a piece of coat hanger , or any stiff wire , fashion a handle shape . Lay the can sideways , and punch one hole in the front edge and two more holes straight across at the rear edge . Hook the handle ends into these holes . Through the side directly opposite the handle , cut a crisscross midway between the front and back of the can . Use a strong , sharply pointed knife to make each crosscut , which should be from 1 V/2 to 2 inches in length . Gently push a utility candle , one that is thick and slow-burning , through the middle of the slits until it protrudes about 2 inches inside the container . The sharp metal points in the center of the slits will be forced inward and will secure the candle in place . As the wax is consumed in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candle is lit , the can acts as a shield against wind , rain , or snow and as a reflector , spreading illumination over a wide area . To store your candle lantern , hang it by the handle . SNOWSHOES If you need snowshoes , make a pair from string and saplings . They wo n't have much eye appeal , but they will serve their purpose well . Cut four fairly straight saplings having a circumference approximating that of a man 's thumb . Trim each to a length of 4 feet if the shoes are intended for a person of average height ; for a taller person , make them 5 feet long . These sticks should be sufficiently supple to bend a little without breaking . They will serve as the frame of the snowshoes . Slice one side of their ends at an angle so that the resulting flat surfaces of each pair of sticks will fit together , forming a point . Bind together the ends of each pair in the following way : Tie string ( heavy cotton string or nylon fishnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several inches before the two saplings join . Next , encircle both sticks with the string , spiraling toward the pointed end and stopping a few inches short of the tip . Now // reverse your direction . Wind backward and finish by securing the string on the other stick , opposite the starting point on the first one . While working , keep the string taut . Make cross supports for the frame by cutting four 1- by 2-inch bars roughly 8 to 10 inches in length . Using your knife , carve a concave opening in the ends of these crossbars so that they will fit snugly around the contour of the long saplings . Insert each cross support between the vertical sticks of the frame at the point where they are no longer parallel but begin to taper toward the pointed ends . Bind the frame and crossbars together with a webbing of string . Tie strings securely near the ends of the long vertical sticks , and crisscross them rather closely for the length of the frame . Now run strings vertically , weaving them in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the string taut as you weave , the tension will be evenly distributed throughout the snowshoes . Make a rope bridle across each snowshoe to fit around the toes of your boots . Bind the bridle in place just in front of the snowshoe 's center of balance . The toe of the snowshoe will then be raised each time you lift your foot and move forward . Fasten on your new footgear by running a loop of rope around your ankle and hooking it into the bridle rope with a bent nail or some other workable contrivance . Add extra strength to the areas where your boots will be resting ; use a piece of rawhide , a sturdy fabric , or rope for reinforcement purposes . Binding short sticks on the inner sides of the long saplings , from one cross support to the other , will strengthen the main part of the frame , especially the boot area . Your homemade snowshoes are now ready to be strapped on for a long trek over the snow . ICE CHOPPER An ax may be used to chip holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade near a fire or , at least , of blowing on it . A cold blade , being very brittle , can easily break . Avoid the risk of damaging ax blades by making an ice chopper for winter fishing . Assemble these materials : * a chisel having a very wide blade ( the kind used on brick or wood ) * a section of iron water pipe , 4 feet in length // * 1 bicycle handlebar grip * 15 feet of rope Drive the chisel into the pipe . In doing so , you may dull the cutting edge . Grind or file it sharp when your ice chopper is completed . Push the bicycle handlebar grip on the other end of the pipe to provide a comfortable handle . Tie the length of rope to the ice chopper so that you can retrieve it should the tool slip into the water . NECKERCHIEF HOOD Make a protective hood from a plain , 36-inch-square neckerchief . Spread it flat . Fold the two upper corners down to form contiguous right triangles . Now roll up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roll . Put your head in the gap between the two triangles . The ends of the roll can be carried forward to be knotted beneath the chin . Since the hood covers the back of the neck , you have only to pull your coat collar close against it to keep out chill air and wind . It also protects the back of the neck from sunburn on hikes and fishing trips . Cowpokes of the old days originated these useful hoods . HOBNAILED BROGANS Hobnailed wading brogans are a boon to the sportsman fishing in streams where slippery , moss-covered rocks abound . Those on the market are expensive . It is a simple matter to make your own hobnails from ordinary work shoes that have leather soles . Depending on the soles ' thickness , you will need wood screws about 1/2 to 3/4 inches in length . Although brass screws do n't rust , they wear down more quickly than steel ones . Do n't drive in too many screws or place them too near each other , or else they will fail to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply . Screw them into the heels and soles , and leave 1/4 inch to function as hobs . You 'll discover that the sharp screw edges do a better gripping job on slimy rocks than rounded hobnails. // TYING FISHING FLIES AND DEVISING LURES You will need the following tools and materials for tying flies : Required Tools and Materials * VISE : You must have a steel vise with a clamp for fastening it securely to the work surface . The height should be adjustable for ease in working ; the jaws should be adjustable to accommodate small and large hooks . * RUBBER BUMPER : A bumper can be purchased at a hardware store . Attach this rubber button by its screw center to the edge of your work table some 8 inches on the right side of the vise . It will serve to grip the tying thread , maintaining the necessary tension on it . Drive a small nail into the work surface , several inches to the right of the button , as a spindle for the spool of thread . * SCISSORS : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 4 inches in overall length , with strong , straight blades that taper to a sharp point . * STYLET . The stylet is used for many small jobs , such as the removal of hardened lacquer from the eyes of hooks . Make this handy tool by embedding a needle in a dowel of wood . A hat pin is a good substitute . * HOOK HONE : Have a 4-inch hone at hand to keep sharp points on the hooks . * THREAD : You will need a spool of white nylon thread . * WAX : Wax for the tying thread can be made as follows : Fill a wide-mouthed jar ( about 2r/2 to 2% inches wide and 3 or 4 inches high ) with powdered rosin to a 1-inch depth . Add only enough turpentine to permeate the rosin . Put the open jar in hot water over low heat . When the contents become syrupy in consistency and clear amber in color , remove the jar from the stove , cover , and let cool . The cooled wax will be sernifirm and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dissolve in water . * WAX PAD : A 2-inch square of oilcloth will serve to hold wax , making it accessible when you need to wax the tying thread . Simply pull the thread slowly through the wax . * LACQUER : Coat the fly head and other areas wound in thread with waterproof varnish . Colorless nail polish is inexpensive and convenient to use . For ease of application , sharpen the small brush . Attaching Thread to the Hook The curve of the hook must be firmly clamped in the vise , with the barb below . Wax the thread by folding the wax pad over it and pulling it through the wax . Wax 6 inches at one time . The thread binds all parts of the fly to the hook in one continuous piece . Slip the thread over the hook shank a short distance from the eye end . This spot will be designated as the wing site . Always keep the thread taut in your hands as you work . Bring the thread in your right hand down under the hook shank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the shank . Follow this procedure three times . There should now be a spiral winding of thread , with the thread of the left hand bound firmly against the hook shank . Press the middle finger of your left hand against the wound thread to keep it from loosening . Slide your right hand down the thread , and wedge it behind the rubber button to hold it taut . With your free right hand , cut the thread 's short end close to the hook . Making Fly Bodies Two simple fly bodies that can be fashioned successfully with little practice are made of flat tinsel and chenille. * FLAT TINSEL BODY After attaching the tying thread at the wing site , cut diagonally a 1-foot length of mediumwidth flat tinsel . Holding the strip between the left forefinger and thumb , press the thread windings against the hook shank with the middle finger . Free the thread from the button with your right hand . Lay the diagonally cut end of tinsel against // the hook 's side at the wing site . Carry the thread up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook shank , up , and across the tinsel again . The second turn of the tying thread should be on the right side of the preliminary one . As the thread is brought down behind the shank the last time , slide your thumb and forefinger down the thread ; catch it in back of the rubber button . Using the right thumbnail , bend the tinsel point back over the windings of thread . Holding the thread windings in place with the left hand 's middle finger , free the thread with your right hand . Wind a fourth turn of thread over the folded tinsel and secure it . Fasten the thread behind the button . Keeping it flat , carry the tinsel forward and beneath the hook . Hold it slanted in the direction of winding ? in this case toward the hook 's curve . Bring it over the hook shank and down behind . Take it with the left hand as the right is on the point of meeting the thread . Make each turn of tinsel contiguous to the preceding strip but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hook , changing hands when required . Continue wrapping the tinsel around the hook shank until it reaches a point parallel to the barb . Be careful not to snag the tinsel on the tip of the hook as you near the curve . The point on the shank parallel to the barb marks the end of the body of your fly . It is the tail site . At this point , reverse the direction in which the tinsel is held . Holding it taut and slanting forward , wrap it over itself toward the eye of the hook . Wind as previously described , with each turn flat and each edge touching the preceding one . Guard against overlapping . When the spot where the tinsel was tied to the hook is covered , press a left-hand finger on the tying thread , and free the thread from the button with your right hand . Wrap two turns of thread about the tinsel , winding in the direction of the hook eye . This will secure the tinsel . Catch the thread behind the button . Diagonally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tinsel over the thread with the left hand . After releasing the thread with your right hand , bind the folded tinsel with one turn of thread . The body is now finished . * CHENILLE BODY Clamp the curved end of the hook in the vise with the barb down . Wax about 6 inches of tying thread in the manner already described . Fasten the thread at the tail site . Hold the short end in the left hand , and with the right hand , place the thread against the hook at the spot above and parallel to the hook 's point . Bring the thread down and in back of the hook shank and then up // in front , crossing over the piece held in the left hand . Repeat this procedure four times , spiraling toward the curve of the hook and ending the windings just in front of the spot above the barb . Catch the thread behind the button . Cut off the short end of the thread . Pull fuzz from one end of a chenille strand , and expose 1/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thread directly over the spot above the barb . Have its end face in the direction of the hook eye . With the right hand , remove the thread from the rubber button and , spiraling toward the hook eye , wind it around the core . Continue winding an open spiral of thread ; stop at the wing site . Catch the thread behind the button . Now begin wrapping the chenille around the shank of the hook . Make close spirals to completely cover the hook and the tying thread . Release the thread from the button . Carry it over the end of the chenille body at the wing site , and bind it twice to the hook shank . Secure the thread at the button . Clip off excess chenille . Bind down any fibers of chenille or core visible in front of the windings of thread . The chenille body is finished . Making Tails and Wings The tail hair of a deer is good material for tails and wings of fishing flies , particularly when the hair is slightly wavy . Such hair undulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * BUCKHAIR TAIL : Put the hook in the vise ; fasten on thread at the tail site . Cut a small hair tuft from a buck 's tail . Try to avoid trimming the edges to give a uniform appearance ; take advantage of the naturally tapering hair ends . In order to even the tips , remove all short and long hairs . Longer hairs may sometimes be replaced lower in the wisp . Eliminate those with broken ends . The length of the tail should equal the length of the hook shank . Grasp the hair tuft in the left hand just short of the middle , and put a dab of nail polish on its center where the thread will cross over it . Hold the tuft on the hook shank at the tail site . Free the thread with the right hand . Carrying it up and over the hook , slide it between the tuft and thumb and then between the tuft and forefinger on the farther side . Maintain the // tuft on the top side of the shank , slightly in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with thread . Raise the tuft , and bring the thread under and behind it to the other side . Encircle the tail 's base with a complete turn of tying thread . Next , make two thread windings around both hair and hook shank . Have them spiral forward . The tail is now securely bound to the shank . Catch the thread at the rubber button . Clip away the hair projecting toward the hook eye at the spot just after the thread windings . Cut at an angle so that the ends will taper. * BUCKHAIR WING : Fasten thread on the hook at the wing site . Cut a slender tuft of hair from a buck 's tail . Make the ends uniform as you did for the fly tail . The wing length should extend just beyond the curve of the hook . Put a dab of nail polish on the tuft where the thread will cross over it . Make two complete windings of thread around the hair and hook shank to anchor the tuft . Now lift the wing ; bring the thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farther side and above the hook . Repeat this procedure . Holding the hair close to the shank , make a turn of thread over the spot where the encircling thread meets on the top side of the hook . This will keep the wing down in the correct position . Wind the thread twice more around the hook and hair ; again , it should spiral forward . Catch the thread at the button . Cut off the forward shaft of hair , tapering it at an angle . Wind one more turn of tying thread around the cut ends . The wing should recline along the hook shank . Practice Practice tying each part separately until you develop skill and speed . When you have thoroughly mastered these steps , make a fly from start to finish with one continuous thread , beginning with the tail and ending at the head ? formed by the final knot ? known as the wrap knot . As you add each material , it must conceal the thread already in place and the snipped ends of materials already used . Cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snipped end of the body with the wing , and cover the ends of wing material with the head , composed of the wrap knot . // Making the Fly Head Attach the tying thread at the wing site . The thread should enter the right hand beneath the fourth finger , across the underside of the fingertips , and should be held by the thumb and index finger . With the left hand , seize the thread coming from the right hand , and hold it against and in front of the hook shank by extending the middle and fourth fingers and catching the tying thread between them . It should be parallel with the hook shank and on the side nearer you . The thread now forms a large loop from hook to fingers . In your right hand , tautly grasp the thread descending from the hook . Carry it up and then across the parallel thread that is in front of the shank . With the taut thread holding the parallel thread against the hook shank , the left hand is free to aid in wrapping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shank . Going up , over , and around the hook shank and parallel thread four times , wind the taut thread spiralling closely in the direction of the hook eye . While gripping the taut thread in the right hand , begin pulling the long end of the parallel thread with the left hand . The loop of thread will start to diminish in size . As it grows smaller , press it from in back against the thread windings on the hook with your right middle finger . The loop will constantly diminish as you pull . Release your right hand 's hold on the thread , but continue pressing on the threads with the middle finger until the loop completely disappears . Cut off the long end of the thread . The tying thread is now securely bound on the hook by the wrap knot , terminating your fishing fly . Several applications of nail polish or lacquer will completely cover the separate thread windings and give a finished appearance . Fly Varieties There are many types of flies and a variety of materials from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silk , or synthetic floss , chenille , tinsel , wool , fur , and feathers . As much as possible , try to use recycled materials : scraps of fur that you can obtain free from furriers ; local reed fibers ; and discarded tinfoil . Let your dog donate a snip of hair ! After conquering the preliminaries , you may want to use a wider range of ' materials and progress to more complicated // flies . You may also want to increase your supply of tools by adding fly-tying pliers with strongly gripping jaws and a hackle gauge to determine the correct hackle size for the different hook sizes . * RUBBER-BAND FLY Here is a fly requiring no skill and only a few seconds to make . Take a handful of rubber bands , preferably green or white , and push them through the eye of a short-shanked hook . When they are centered in the eye , cut off the looped edges with scissors . Now encircle the rubber bands just below the eye with several windings of thread , and tie them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they move through the water . For extra weight a small spinner may be added above the fly . Nail Lure An excellent and inexpensive homemade lure requires nothing more than a twenty-penny nail , two split rings , and a treble hook . Using a saw and file , remove both ends of the nail so that a 31/2-inch length remains . Near each end drill a hole , and on either side of it file a bevel . Insert a ring in each hole . Fasten your fishing line to one ring ; attach a treble hook to the other . A nail lure can be cast to a surprising distance right on target . You will find it especially effective where fish are schooling . Spinner-Blades and Spoons From the shallows and shores of lake and stream , gather freshwater mussel shells . You may find some quickly and in one spot , thanks to raccoons . They know the location of mussel beds ; shells will be left on the banks as evidence of their feasting . The mother-of-pearl interiors of the mollusks , shining with iridescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shape shell pieces into spinner-blades and spoons with a coarse hand file . Drill a hole at each end to accommodate split ring , swivel , and treble hook . Make small pearl spoons for trout lures ; fashion bigger ones to attract large pike and bass . // COLLAPSIBLE FISH LANDING NET Make the handle for your landing net from a sturdy broomstick . A length of 13 inches is generally satisfactory , but this dimension may be adjusted to suit your preference . From an electrical supply shop , acquire a 3/4-inch piece of brass tubing . Turn the cut end of the handle on a lathe or use a wood rasp to diminish its circumference so that the tubing will slip on to a depth of 31/4 inches . Fashion the hoop for the net from a piece of telegraph wire with a 3/16-inch diameter . To shape it smoothly and evenly , wrap it about a large crock or anything round of the proper circumference . Just short of closing the circle , bend the remaining two ends of wire ( which should measure about 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them parallel . The space between the parallel wires should be sufficient to accommodate the narrow end of the handle . Then bend the tips of the wires inward , forming small right angles , by holding them in a vise or the jaws of a monkey wrench and hammering them down . Bore a 3/I6-inch hole on either side of the handle for inserting the right angle hooks . From these holes , gouge a groove along the handle for the wire to fit in flush with the wood . If you lack a gouge , use a piece of red-hot wire to burn in the groove . Buy an inexpensive net and attach it to the hoop . Slide the piece of brass tubing to the far end of the thinner portion of the handle . Fit the ends of the wire in the grooves , inserting the hooks in their holes . Now move the tubing forward and cover the wire . Your landing net is assembled . Wind a good length of the handle with some old fish line to make it easy to grip . Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle will enable you to hang the net from a hook in your belt . For storage or carrying , slip the tubing back and fold the net back over the handle . CREEL An excellent creel can be fashioned from the simplest of materials . Use shingles , preferably of cedar , for the sides and ends . Make the top and bottom of 1/4- or 1/2-inch boards . These boards should be cut curved to fit the shingle sides of the creel , which will bend accommodatingly without splitting . Use small nails to tack the shingles to the top // and bottom boards . Before nailing on the front , saw a generous notch in it for the insertion of fish . Make a cover for the opening , attaching it to the creel by a strap or a small pair of hinges . Tack a shoulder strap onto the back . The creel can be made in whatever size suits you . A box of this kind will maintain your catch in a firm , fresh condition , especially if you layer leaves , moss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time at all , you can make an efficient little device for removing scales from fish . It requires a short piece of wood suitable for a handle and a bottle cap having sharp , scalloped edges . Tack the cap on one end of the handle , hammering the nail through the underside of the cap . Bend down any extension of the nail on top to attach the cap more securely . You will find this contrivance a very serviceable scaler . SIMPLE SMOKER FOR FISH Here is an easy way to make a cheap fish smoker : Take a good-sized , firm cardboard carton . Open one end , and tape or tie the flaps so that the box can be set upright on them . Pierce the carton , 6 inches below the other end , with metal coat hangers or skewers to form a level grillwork . Add a little brown sugar to a brine solution so salty as to float a potato . Steep any fish of solid meat in this solution for a minimum of four hours , overnight being preferable . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let dry completely in the air . When dry , it will exhibit a slight glaze . Build a small charcoal fire . When the coals become white , add hardwood chips . Hickory or apple impart a distinctive flavor . Lay the brined fish on the grill . Set the box on its flap legs over the smoldering chips . Close the flaps on top , and weight them shut with a rock . Fish about two inches thick will need to smoke approximately four hours . Less time is required for thinner pieces . The wood chips should be hindered from flaring up by the lack of oxygen in the closed box . However , if the lower portions of the carton become hot to the touch , sprinkle them with // water as a precautionary measure . If the lower edges of the box ignite , quickly dowse them with water . FIRE RACK To keep frying pans and coffee pots from tipping over into your campfire , make a fire rack from hinges . You will need a stove bolt and three 8-inch strap hinges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , and line up their middle holes . Put a stove bolt through them . Now you have the top of your fire rack ; the remaining hinge segments will act as legs . When the rack is not in use , it can be conveniently folded for storage or for carrying in a pocket of your camping clothes . CROW DECOYS You will need one wire coat hanger for each crow decoy . Straighten the hook with pliers to make the feet for anchoring it in the ground . Bend the rest of the hanger in the outline of a crow . To achieve a realistic shape , compare it as you work with a picture of a crow in profile . Cut newspaper in strips . Saturate them with a papiermache paste of flour and water . Vertically wrap the wire framework with the moist strips . Let dry overnight . Fasten a wire hook on the bird 's back if you plan to hang it in a tree . More papier-mache may be added on the sides to give the crow a fuller body , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decoy . DECOY WEIGHTS You can make excellent weights for floating decoys with small expenditure in money and effort . Purchase premixed concrete at a hardware store . Add water according to directions . Fill paper cups with the concrete , and insert spread cotter keys for a string eye . Twelve weights can be made from a 1 ' /2-pound bucket of cement . // DUCK RETRIEVER To make a lightweight duck retriever that can be carried easily in your hunting coat , cut strong cord or a heavy fishing line to a length of 6 feet . At each end tie a loop . In the center of the cord ( or fish line ) , tie another strong string , from 75 to 150 feet long . Take a small scrap of wood about 2 by 4 inches in size , and wind the string around it . Start with the free end of the longer length , leaving the cord with the loops to be rolled on last . Tuck it in your pocket . When the duck you have killed lies far out of reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet long . Slide a loop of your duck retriever over each end ; draw it tight . Throw the stick out beyond the bird . Pull the triangle over your duck , and haul the fowl in to shore . Toss aside the stick . Roll up your string retriever as before , and put it in your hunting coat . PLAYTHINGS BEAN BAG In times past , a bean bag was generally found in most every child 's collection of toys . It was fun to throw back and forth and could be used for playing games of skill , such as tossing it into a receptacle placed at a distance . A bean bag had the advantage of staying put if it failed to be caught or missed its mark , not rolling out of reach like a ball . Make your bean bag of some heavy material that will stand up well under hard use . Cut two 6-inch squares . With their right sides facing , sew them strongly together , allowing a seam depth of 1/2 inch . Leave a few inches open through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turn it on the right side . If there is any chance that the bag might become wet , first heat the beans in a 200-degree oven for about one hour to keep them from germinating . Do not overstuff the bag so that it is rigid . It should be somewhat limp and flexible , no more than 1 Y2 inches in thickness . Turn in the raw edges of the gap , and stitch the bean bag closed . // CLOTH BALL Ransack your rag bag for cloth scraps too small for patchwork . These odds and ends can be used to create a safe toy for babies and toddlers : a cloth ball . The more variety in the color and texture of the fabrics , the more attractive the plaything . Suedes , sailcloth , and other such sturdy materials are especially suitable for cloth balls , but any fabric will do nicely . You will need a cardboard pattern in the shape of an equilateral pentagon when cutting the cloth remnants . A size 3 inches across between the farthest points is about right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more you increase the pattern size , the bigger will be the completed ball . Cut twelve pentagons , allowing an extra % inch for seams as you scissor about the pattern . Sew down the seam allowance on all five sides of each piece . Iron the stitched areas so that the cloth will lie flat . Now begin assembling the patches . Sew together three pentagons , which will form the top of the ball . First , put two patches together , and whipstitch their common seam line . After fitting the third piece against them , sew one of its sides to each patch . The three pieces will have formed a sort of dome . Fit the points of three more patches against the triangular edges beneath the dome , and stitch them in place . You have finished the top half of the ball . To make the bottom half , repeat the same steps . Complete the toy by matching up the jogs in the two halves and sewing the remaining seams . Leave an opening in one to insert stuffing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings snipped in pieces . Sew the opening shut with the blind stitch . Just before closing the last seam , tuck a big jingle bell in the center of the stuffing . It wo n't ring but will rattle as the toy is rolled or tossed . DISC TOP Cut the disc for your top from a 5-inch square of pine wood , 1 inch thick . In the center of the disc , make a hole having a 1-inch diameter . Saw 3 inches from the tip of an old broom handle . Push the flat end into the hole in the disc until // it is flush with the wood 's surface . Secure it with glue . Use a slender 5-inch-long dowel for the top 's stem . Bore a hole in the middle of the flat end of the broom handle nub . Insert the stem , and reinforce it with glue . Into the rounded tip of the broom handle section , hammer a domed tack to facilitate the top 's spinning smoothly . Paint the toy a bright color . Drill a small hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoelace through it . Thread the other end of the cord through the width of a short dowel to use as a grip , and knot it on the far side of the hole . Make winding the cord or shoelace about the stem easier by placing the top 's tip in a hole cut in a wooden.block . After winding the cord around the stem , set the toy on the floor , give the cord a quick pull , and let your top spin . SOCK DOLL Use a boy 's or man 's sock to make a sock doll . Lay it flat , and cut off the upper half of the ankle section . Vertically cut through its double thickness in the center so that you have two folded portions for the arms . Turn the pieces on the wrong side , and sew seams 1/8 inch deep , except on one end . Fill the arms wi l ' stuffing through the open ends ; then sew them closed . Vertically cut open the remainder of the ankle section at each side to form the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body , sew the leg seams on the wrong side , 1/8 inch from the edge . Turn the material right side out again . Cut off the toe . Through this opening you can stuff the legs , body , and head with cotton . Fill the doll until firm but not stiff . Sew the head closed and stitch on the arms . To form the neck , tightly tie a piece of string around the doll just below the face area . Shoe buttons make good eyes . For a realistic touch , you might stick on two of the white circles used to reinforce the pages of looseleaf notebooks . Then sew small black shoe buttons in the center of each . Embroider the other features . Use yarn for hair , and dress the sock doll according to whim . // SOCK PUPPET I To create a sock puppet , select a size of sock appropriate for the hand that will work it . Lay the sock flat , and cut a slit several inches deep for the mouth , starting from the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slit will depend upon how big or small you want the mouth to be . ) For the interior of the mouth , cut a piece from felt to fit the opening , crease the fabric in half across its width , and sew it in place . Complete the puppet with embroidered or button eyes , yarn hair , ears , and clothing . Let imagination be your guide . Now put your hand in the sock , the thumb below and four fingers in the upper section above the mouth . By opening and closing your hand , the puppet will speak . The resiliency of the material allows you to make your creation smile , look grumpy , or move its head in any direction . This type of puppet is particularly adaptable to animal characters . SOCK PUPPET II Turn the sock inside out . The closely knitted sole is just right for the puppet 's face . Roll thin cardboard or heavy paper into a tube with a circumference to fit around the index finger and a length of about 5 inches . Glue or tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sock . Stuff the part intended for the puppet 's head with cotton , using enough to give it a round shape . Let the tube extend from the stuffed portion downward , forming a neck . At the point where you judge the head should end , tightly tie string or thread around the tube . At appropriate places on each side of the body , cut slits for arm holes . Sew on simple arms shaped like glove fingers . Embroider or paint on features ( use poster paint ) . Add hair and clothing . To work the puppet , put hand and arm into the sock leg , using thumb and center finger to manipulate the arms and the index finger in the tube to move the head . HAND PUPPET Design a cloth puppet according to the hand dimensions of the person who will use it . Place the hand flat on a piece of // paper with the three middle fingers together and the thumb and little finger spread at a comfortable distance . Trace around the hand , including several inches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern on some heavy cloth ( wool , drapery material , etc. ) , and cut two sides . With the right sides facing , sew them together . Hem the edge of the " sleeve . " Turn the puppet back to the right side of the material . It should cover the hand like a glove , but a glove with three fingers : a large middle one for the head area , flanked by two smaller ones for the arms . You may transform the puppet into any character you wish , human or animal , by adding yarn hair or ears , embroidering facial features , and dressing it . Insert your middle fingers in the head to move it , using the thumb and little finger for arm actions . TOY PARACHUTE A square of lightweight scrap material or a man 's old handkerchief can act as the chute . To each corner tie a piece of string 12 inches long . If you use a square of fabric larger than handkerchief size , increase the string length proportionately . Saw several inches off the rounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washers of about the same circumference as the nub of the broom handle , and run a screw eye through their centers and into the flat end of the broomstick tip . Now you have a weight for the parachute . Attach it by knotting the four strings to the eye of the screw . MODELING CLAY To make an excellent modeling clay for children , blend 1 cup of cornstarch with 2 cups of baking soda . Stir in 1 ? cups of cold water , and add food coloring , if desired . Heat the mixture over a medium flame . Stir constantly until it reaches a doughlike consistency . Cool the clay , and cover it with a moist cloth until ready for use . Finished pieces can be preserved by coating them with shellac . // WOODEN BLOCK PUZZLE Cut cubes of white pine wood , 11/2 by 11/2 inches . Select six paper pictures , and cut precisely around each . Next , brush three sides of the cubes with several coats of lacquer . When the sides are dry , repeat the procedure with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will form six different puzzles when correctly assembled . Using wooden blocks to construct picture puzzles originated long ago in Germany . RUBBER-BAND BOAT Cut a piece of wood 8 ? inches long , 2% inches wide , and 1 inch thick for the hull of your boat . Shape the front in a tapered curve for the bow . Cut out a rectangle at the stern , 2 inches deep and 1V8 inches across , to accommodate the paddle wheel . Cut notches 1/s inch deep on the outer edge of the resulting projections , 1/2 inch in from their ends , to hold a rubber band . Make the four-blade paddle wheel of two lapjoined pieces of thin board , fitted together as in egg-carton construction . Reinforce the joining with waterproof glue . If you like , you may make a cabin of a block of wood 31/2 inches by 13/4 inches by 1 inch , fastening it in place with waterproof glue . Fit the rubber band into the notches in the stern . You may need to test different sizes of rubber bands to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber band and wind . SIMPLE SAILBOAT Cut a hull about 8 inches long and 2% inches wide from a sheet of cork . Taper the front of the boat to shape its bow . Sharpen a straight twig somewhat , and drive it into the cork for a mast . Make a sail from paper or thin cardboard . A hole at the bottom and top of the sail will allow you to slip it on the twig mast . If a strong gale is up , the owner of the craft may request that a small hole be punched in the stern for attaching a long string to keep his sailboat from being carried out of sight . // DIAMOND-SHAPED KITE A diamond-shaped kite is the easiest of all kites to make . Essential materials are these : * one straight strip of wood for the vertical piece , 3/16 by % by 36 inches in length * one straight strip of wood for the cross piece , 3/16 by % by 30 inches in length * tissue paper or lightweight cloth for the covering material , 30 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of both sticks , make a 1/4-inch deep cut with a saw . Center the cross strip perpendicularly on the vertical strip at a point 9 inches from one end . Bind the strips together using string . Glue the binding . Run a string around the edges of this framework through the slits at the ends of the strips , and tie it . Place the framework on top of the covering material , and cut it 1 inch larger than the kite 's framework . Fold the extra 1 inch over the taut string . In the case of tissue paper , glue it down ; if cloth is used , sew it . Bow the cross piece to a depth of 4 inches , with the convex curve away from the covering . Keep it in this bowed position by tying a piece of string from one end to the other . Fasten the bridle string to the vertical strip at the kite 's top . Then punch a small hole in the paper 10 inches from the bottom , and again tie the string to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attach the main string to the bridle . When the wind is blowing at 12 miles an hour or more , test your kite . If the kite has a tendency to dive downward , add a tail string with rags tied to it at intervals .
