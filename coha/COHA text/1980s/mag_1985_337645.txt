Cynics should run for cover . Anyone for whom the USA for Africa project has assumed a nearly impenetrable smog of sanctimony will be hard pressed to clear the air . All right , everyone got sore at Prince for not jumping in . And yes , Waylon Jennings walked out of the session , but he was bushed and besides joked later about his best friend : " That recording studio was n't big enough for me and Willie Nelson . " <P> Slim pickings indeed . On every other front , the success of the project continues to be phenomenal . We Are the World , currently No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart , is the fastest-climbing single of the decade , and the biggest seller in the history of Columbia Records . To date , at least 4 million copies have been snapped up and often passed along . " People buy three , four , even five at a time , " says Mark Tindle , marketing director of a Dallas distributor . " It 's their way of giving to charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at No. 9 on Billboard 's chart . It contains nine previously unreleased tracks by participating artists , including some particularly nifty contributions from Bruce Springsteen ( a searing version of Jimmy Cliff 's Trapped ) , Huey Lewis and the News and Tina Turner . Prince even sent over a tune , 4 the Tears in Your Eyes , which is a standout . <P> Two million copies of the album have already been shipped to stores , and conservative estimates are that the record will continue to sell well for at least another month and a half . At that point it will probably need another single to keep it going , and , says Personal Manager Ken Kragen , one of the key organizers of USA for Africa : " We told the artists we would n't do anything without getting back to them . I hope we release more singles . " One performer , at least , has an answer ready . Steve Perry , who thought no old song of his was " worthy for release , especially for such a cause , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in with no strings attached . " It 's my gift to the cause , " he says . " That We Are the World session was one of the highlights of my life . " <P> On Good Friday , thousands of radio stations , from Rome , Ga. , to the Voice of America , broadcast We Are the World simultaneously ; even Muzak shattered its sacrosanct format to chime in . In New York City , radio station WYNY-FM invited citizens to join a chorus on the steps of St. Patrick 's Cathedral ; hundreds showed up and let loose . In Indianapolis , three clubs donated their facilities and three local bands their talents . Latin artists , featuring Jose Feliciano and Julio Iglesias , have already made their own recorded contribution , Cantare Cantaras , which is projected to pull in $15 million for hunger relief ; gospelers have cut Do Something Now ; and an array of heavy- metal performers , from Judas Priest to Quiet Riot , have formed an outfit called Hear ' n Aid to record Stars , probably in mid-May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hopping on it can get . Twenty million dollars has been raised since March 6 , according to Kragen , on behalf of USA for Africa alone . He expects to have $50 million by summer 's end . By that time , the first medical and financial support should already have reached Africa , and a single song will have begun , really and directly , to save lives .
