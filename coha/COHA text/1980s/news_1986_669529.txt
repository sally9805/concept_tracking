This peculiarly Afrikaner mission to survive , inherited by President Pieter W. Botha , has rarely seemed more difficult , or more urgent , than it does today . In a country beset by black rebellion , white confusion , economic recession , and international criticism , he is under great pressure to shape a new identity for himself , his party , and his people . ' ' We must offer our supporters a clear vision of the future , ' ' a Botha aide says privately . ' ' We have not yet done so. ' ' // In the short term there will be more violence . The 16th of June - next Monday - marks the anniversary of the blacks ' Soweto uprising of 1976 , during which an estimated 575 people , mostly black , were killed . Despite the government ' s recent ban on any indoor or outdoor commemoration ceremonies , blacks pledge to hold memorial ceremonies , rallies , and work boycotts. // // This will provide a focal point for new pressure from South Africa ' s black majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation - not reform it , as the government is attempting to do . But in a proposal of toughened security laws and in President Botha ' s recent remark that the state still has huge police muscle in reserve , he has signaled it is ready to meet force with force. // For the government , August is the month that really matters . President Botha has called a rare federal congress of his National Party , to be followed by a reconvened session of Parliament . His supporters have hinted at party fund-raisers that there may be a national referendum later in the year seeking a ' ' constitutional dispensation ' ' for blacks , similar to the 1983 vote that led to the creation of separate parliamentary houses for mixed-race ' ' Coloreds ' ' and for Asians. // According to Mr. Botha ' s colleague : ' ' A clear vision of the future - that is what August is all about. ' ' // It is likely to be an Afrikaner ' s vision , for Afrikaners alone . Some outsiders posit a new National Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emerging black middle class for the kind of transition to black majority rule that has occurred in Zimbabwe . But Afrikaner history seems to cry out against the analogy. // The National Party not only represents , but embodies , Afrikanerdom . Many of the 2 million English-speakers , who are part of the country ' s roughly 5 million whites , openly accept or support the idea of a ' ' Zimbabwean ' ' experience for South Africa . And , especially at a time when President Botha appears threatened by opposition from the Afrikaner right , the government figures that most English-speakers will back it - to avert a right-wing victory. // The government , however , has no intention of presiding over the ' ' Zimbabweization ' ' of South Africa. // A senior government minister confides : ' ' My aim is to share power , without abdicating power. ' ' // Most Afrikaners still seem to cherish that aim - to somehow share power without losing control. // At Stellenbosch University , some student leaders have made headlines in the past 18 months by proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Last year , President Botha withdrew the passports of eight students to keep them from traveling to Zambia to meet with exiled leaders of the African National Congress ( ANC ) , the most powerful black nationalist group fighting to overthrow the white-ruled regime. // Last month , several student leaders called on the government to legalize the outlawed ANC and release Nelson Mandela , a founder of its military wing , from jail . Mr. Mandela has been in prison since the early 1960s when he was convicted of plotting a revolution. // ' ' These so-called student leaders are on an ego trip , ' ' complains one law student . ' ' Most of the students aren ' t in favor of the things they ' re announcing . We know the dangers. ' ' // Other students , although critical of the government ' s interference with the students ' Zambia trip , say they have misgivings about any ANC role in negotiating the country ' s future. // Gerrit Olivier , a Stellenbosch graduate who teaches Afrikaans at a university in Johannesburg , recently edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambia mission . He sensed ' ' a fundamental change with these students - in the sense that more and more people seem to want more open discussion . ' ' But , he adds : ' ' It is all still very tentative . . . a bit naive in certain respects . I think most students don ' t realize that any future ( ANC-negotiated ) constitution will also entail a redistribution of wealth. ' ' // In Pretoria , veteran apartheid foe Willem Kleynhans says he has noted a change in tone among Afrikaner students taking his political science course . ' ' But I can count on the fingers of one hand the number who accept genuine power-sharing and reform as I ' d define it : the idea of a single , fully integrated Parliament. ' ' // Rebel Afrikaner cleric Beyers Naude concurs : ' ' Even among Afrikaner students there is only a very small percentage that would be willing to share power - one man , one vote - in a single system . . . . Among the rest of the Afrikaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government seems to agree . Asked whether he feared political rebellion among Afrikaner youth , Deputy Minister for Information Louis Nel replies : ' ' Yes , there are Stellenbosch students who criticize . But they will , nevertheless , vote for the National Party. ' ' // It is on the Afrikaner right that the party feels vulnerable . In Parliament , the Nationalists today hold a commanding 117 of 166 elected seats . A 1982 defection of party right-wingers into a new Conservative Party , under apartheid theologian Andries Treurnicht , siphoned off fewer than 20 . The further right-wing Herstigte ( reconstituted ) National Party holds one seat. // But the 1982 split put an end to the unquestioned assumption that the interests of the National Party and those of Afrikanerdom were necessarily one and the same. // ' ' The ethnic glue of Afrikanerdom has dissolved , ' ' wrote Prof. Hermann Giliomee from Stellenbosch at the time. // The Conservative Party has won two by-elections in the rural Transvaal . It came close to capturing a third from a reformist party youngster named Piet Coetzer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The surveys show 45 percent to 50 percent of the electorate support the National Party , ' ' an NP leader remarks . ' ' But in a by-election like Springs , in the type of constituency where the NP should get at least double , according to the surveys , you find we won by a very narrow margin . . . . The right wing is a very real risk. ' ' // Most South African pundits now predict the right-wingers could seriously trim - but not erase - the government ' s majority in a national election. // Botha ' s attempt to preempt the right-wing ' s opposition to reforms seems to have made the problem worse . The new Constitution that caused the right-wing split in the first place changed the locus of power from prime minister to a more powerful president . Botha , who was prime minister , became president. // In addition , national elections had been due by this spring at the latest . But , using the argument that the expanded tricameral Parliament was an entirely new system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out only three years from now . ' ' We have an unelected government ! ' ' complained a 33-year-old NP defector earlier this month , when right-wingers staged a rally in the shadow of the Voortrekker Monument . Criticizing the deferral of a national election , he charged , ' ' P. W. ( Botha ) is a dictator ! ' ' // The right-wing anger no longer seems confined to its earliest exponents , the farmers of the Transvaal veld and blue-collar workers in cities. // A protester at an earlier such rally several weeks ago confided that he had only recently quit the National Party . ' ' I left because the party has stopped listening to its own people , ' ' he said. // There seemed an equally sobering message for the government in May , when right-wingers disrupted a rally by President Botha ' s foreign minister , scheduled at a northern Transvaal site. // Less surprising than the right-wing turnout was the inability of the National Party to muster more than a few hundred to carry its side of the battle . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleynhans remarks . ' ' They could not be mobilized. ' ' // In the heyday of apartheid , the strength of the National Party lay in its organization . The Dutch Reformed Church worked in tandem with a group that promoted and protected the Afrikaners ' cultural identity and political dominance and a network of annual party congresses in each province . The party ' s rule was as monolithic as the Voortrekker Monument on the hill outside Pretoria. // Now , in Kleynhans ' s view , ' ' The leadership is estranged from its electorate . . . . The right wing are the only whites with a clear cause. ' ' // Afrikanerdom , now as in 1948 when it rose to power , thrives on such clarity . It is no accident that the most ardent voice on the Afrikaner left is not the quiet agony of a Nico Smith or the reasoned analysis of a Hermann Giliomee , but the messianic protest of Reverend Naude. // Nor is it surprising that the most influential voice of reform on Nationalist Party benches seems to belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the same ardor we set about implementing apartheid and separate development , we will implement the new system that is being evolved here. ' ' // President Botha ' s apparent hope is to convey a clearer vision of that ' ' evolving system ' ' - perhaps at the August convention - and then seek a specific mandate via referendum rather than risk Afrikaner chaos via election. // That task will be difficult enough. // In selling reform , the National Party must combat the effects of decades of its own teachings . ' ' They brainwashed generations of Afrikaners with white supremacy , instilled fear in them , ' ' Professor Kleynhans says . To this Mr. Naude adds : ' ' How do you undo the fruits of your own indoctrination ? ' ' // But even more daunting for Botha will be the task of getting credible leaders from another quarter - the more than 22 million South Africans who are neither Afrikaner , nor white , nor on the national voting rolls - to negotiate , much less agree , on whatever he proposes. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ' s bankers and businesses to reverse the South African currency ' s downward spin and refuel the economy. // ' ' Afrikaners with money are losing their money , ' ' right-wing chief Eugene Terre Blanche remarks . ' ' Our enemies have helped me. . . . ' ' // An Afrikaner executive with one of the country ' s largest firms agrees : ' ' We ' ve had to lay off some 3 , 000 people in the past year or so . Where do they go ? The blacks cross the border , join the ANC . The whites join Terre Blanche. ' ' // After a pause , he continues : ' ' I am an Afrikaner who feels Botha can ' t possibly provide the reforms we need . He ' s a man who has spent his whole career building and enforcing apartheid ; how can I believe he ' ll really dismantle it ? // ' ' This is my country , and I ' ve come to see that only by accepting that this is a black country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a united and peaceful South Africa , the place I want my children to grow up in. // ' ' I can ' t bring myself to leave . I would never leave , unless I felt my family was in immediate physical danger . But in the present political situation , so far from the kind of change we need , I feel so helpless sometimes . What on earth can I , as an individual , hope to do ? ' ' // Last of a three-part series . The earlier articles appeared June 11 and 12. // //
