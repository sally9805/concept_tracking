The institutional identity of the Salvadoran Army was formed in bloodshed : In 1932 , when the people of El-Salvador first rose in rebellion , the army slaughtered what we have painstakingly calculated to be between 20,000 and 25,000 people .. The matanza ( massacre ) left a legacy of fear that remainsto this day . In the succeeding years the power of the army has grown . Thanks to the largesse of the United States , which endowed El Salvador with some $16.7 million in military aid between 1946 and 1979 , the army has become better trained and better equipped and has developed into a formidable force in Central American terms . Since 1979 the United States has lavished an additional $398.4 million in military aid and $257.9 million in economic aid ( and sponsored some $372.9 million in multilateral aid ) that the military , has been able to tap . With this measure of economic independence , the army has established its own " military culture , " insulated within Salvadoran society , an imperium in imperiohermetic , accountable to no one , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire power and money . There are 500 officers in the security forces  --  the army , National Guard , National Police and Treasury Police  --  more than 90 percent of whom attended El Salvador 's military school . Each officer belongs to a tanda ( graduating class ) and each tanda has a president . During their thirty-year careers , the officers seek contacts and form alliances with members of other tandas , using them to prepare for political power . In past elections , no matter which party received the most votes , the military candidate won . The outgoing president would choose his successor , and together they would assemble a coalition of officers from one major tanda and several allied tandas to enjoy the spoils of office . The tanda system , whose sole objective is the accumulation of wealth through criminal means , remains in power today . The Salvadoran Army is held together not so much by anticommunism , though that sentiment is strong , as by -a vast network of corruption which now controls the country 's nationalized banks , 15 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Center for Investigative Reporting .

After several attempts on his life , he fled El Salvador and has applied for political asylum in the United States . ' land , all export-import activities and a good portion of U.S. aid . A few examples suggest the nature of this corruption . q In 1976 , police officers in Mount Kisco , New York , arrested Manuel Rodriguez , then the ' chief of staff of the Salvadoran Army and the man who was assumed to be El Salvador 's next president . Two Mount Kisco detectives had been working undercover , posing as Mafia figures . Rodriguez approached them , offering to sell millions of dollars ' worth of armaments that had been shipped to El Salvador by the United States . According to the detectives ' report ( Case File No . S-124 ) , " the total monetary value of the arms we were to purchase through the subjects in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be equipped with heavy armament , all types of automatic weapons and ammunition . " One of the detectives , Sgt. Robert Cercena , later added , " Rodriguez told me that he was the same as us , thinking we were Mafia . " The Salvadoran officer was sentenced to two consecutive five-year terms in a Federal detention center ; after two and a half years he was deported and now lives in an elegant section of San Salvador . q According to the Congressional testimony of Robert White , former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador , last February , " There are reports that I consider reliable that some military officers are selling arms before they even get out of the crates to the revolutionaries , because at this point a number of military officers are seeing the end of the road and they want to make sure they have something left when they have to flee . " q James Ronald Richardson , an American citizen touring the country , was killed by Salvadoran security forces while in their custody . Ignacio Lozano , the Ford Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook an investigation of the case . But , he later testified to the House Subcommittee on International Organizations , " we felt that we had great difficulty in getting Washington to focus on this particular case , which we considered to be of extreme seriousness . " When the Carter Administration took over , the investigation was ended and a freeze on impending loans lifted . It seemed to be a clear and unfortunate signal to the Salvadoran Army that it could operate with impunity against citizens of the United States on its own soil and that the human rights policy need not be taken seriously . ? Jose Rodolfo Viera , the first campesino president of El Salvador 's Institute for Agrarian Transformation , the government agency in charge of the land reform program , attempted in 1980 to expose an example of army corruption . He had discovered that the properties the institute had bought before he came to office in October 1979 had been overpriced by at least $40 million  --  some had actually been sold to the government twice  --  with a cut of the inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to members of the leading tandas . Viera went on national television to expose the overpayments . The government did nothing . On January 3 , 1981 , Viera and two American land-reform advisers were gunned down in the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador . After more than a year and a half of inaction , amid increasing international pressure , the Salvadoran government in September charged National Guard Lieut . Rodolfo Lopez Sibrian and Army Capt . Eduardo Avila with directing the crime . After flunking F.B.I.-administered polygraph tests , Avila disappeared and Lopez Sibrian was ordered released by a judge who claimed there was " insufficient evidence " ; both men are closely tied to former Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson , head of the Constituent Assembly , . whose powerful tanda now controls the army garrisons . The Salvadoran military is unlikely to move against its own , so deep is the institutionalization of its corruption , no matter what the United States may direct it to do . It was the consistent pattern of abuses of human rights by the military that prompted Congress to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reforms . The Reagan Administration has twisted itself into many different knots in trying to live up to that provision , and its most recent certification report on El Salvador ( July 27 ) attempts to reassure Congress that progress is being made . " Although serious human rights problems continue to plague El Salvador , " the report says , " and although progress in this area has not been as great as hoped , it is our conclusion that the strong private and public statements made on behalf of human rights by the leadership of the government of El Salvador show that it is making a concerned and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights , " Yet even the new provisional President of El Salvador , Alvaro Magaila , admits that " it is a difficult and complicated matter to control abuses by security forces . " One recent example was reported in The Washington Post . A Green Cross volunteer was repeatedly tortured in the headquarters of the National Police : " In one torture session , the victim was strapped to a rotating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . He was beaten severely and forced to inhale lime . " ( According to Elliot Abrams , Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights , such events should be viewed in the context of " a steady improvement in El Salvador 's human rights performance , especially on the part of the National Police . " ) The United States seems to be in a bind . On the one hand , the inability of either side to achieve a military victory suggests the likelihood of a protracted war  --  which in turn would mean an unending Salvadoran demand for American aid both to continue the fighting and to keep the officers happy in the lucrative business of running the country . On the other , if the war goes on for a long time and the economy continues to suffer , the army may face greater opposition in the countryside or may collapse from within as a result of its own corruption , leaving Washington with only a few absentee oligarchs for its allies . Interestingly , it is a spokesman for the rebels who suggests the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guarantee of American interests is to avoid the total defeat of the army , " says Roberto Roca , one of-the five commandantes of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) . " We 're calling for negotiations before the collapse of the army . " If there is ever to be a settlement in El Salvador  --  and we believe a cease-fire is possible at this moment  --  the future status of the army will have to be carefully determined . F.M.L.N . leaders are willing to accept the " institutionality " of the Salvadoran Army , but they insist that it conduct a " self-purge " ? specifically that it rid itself of the upper echelons of corruption ; the minister of defense , the heads of the Treasury Police and the National Guard , and the infamous Col. Nicolas Carranza , former vice-minister of defense . In addition , of course , d'Aubuisson would have to remove himself from the Constituent Assembly . The people of El Salvador have learned much over the years from the spectacle of a brutal military and an intransigent oligarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget , but they are willing to seek political solutions . Perhaps this is the moment for the Salvadoran Army and the United States to reclaim a measure of moral influence . ? Mil EL SALVADOR ? II Books to Fill the Information Gap To provide additional background information on El Sal- . vador , we asked one of our regular Latin America specialists to review the pertinent books published during the last year . Elizabeth Farnsworth has written widely on U. S. - Latin American relations and was co-author of the ' Dispatches " column in The Nation . She recently won the Freelance Writing Award of the Media Alliance in San Francisco for her journalism over the past five years . ? The Editors ELIZABETH FARNSWORTH W hen the Carter Administration first decided to try to avert a revolution in El Salvador in mid-1979 , it looked , as if events were unfolding in an all-too-familiar sequence .

Robert Armstrong , a lawyer and former Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador , and Janet Shenk , a longtime staff member of the North American Congress on Latin America ( NACLA ) , have written voluminously about El Salvador in recent years  --  mostly in NACLA 's bimonthly Report on the Americas . This book builds on their earlier * writings . It is anecdotal ; enriched by poems , photographs and tables .

Tommie Sue Montgomery 's Revolution in El Salvador : Origins and Evolution covers much of the same ground . But Montgomery , a political scientist who spent eleven months in El Salvador interviewing more than 100 people , excels in chronicling the seemingly endless cycle of coup and repression that began in 1932 and that by 1979 had left the government of Carlos Humberto Romero without legitimacy , precipitating the young officers ' bloodless overthrow of that year . Her history of that coup is the most complete I have read . The book contains photographs and tables of economic data ; it is a good book , but it suffers from trying to cover too much material and is sometimes clumsily organized .
