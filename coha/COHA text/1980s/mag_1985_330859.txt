Collecting child support from a divorced father who does not want to pay is almost impossible  --  just ask any single mother who has tried hounding a tightfisted ex . But a set of federal laws that took effect last week should put more pressure on feckless fathers . Called the Child Support Enforcement Amendments , they require states to deduct support obligations from a delinquent 's paycheck or lose out on some federal welfare funds ( 22 states already have similar programs ) . <P> The federal laws aim to improve some shameful statistics . At the latest accounting , children were owed $3 billion by absent parents , contributing to a rising level of poverty among single mothers and adding to state welfare rolls . Fully half of the 4 million divorced mothers in the U.S. who are entitled to support payments get only part or none of the full amount . Although the crackdown has been applauded , some groups have reservations . David Levy , president of the Washington-based National Council for Children 's Rights , says that the laws will be most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments anyway . Marginally employed deadbeats will still be hard to track .
