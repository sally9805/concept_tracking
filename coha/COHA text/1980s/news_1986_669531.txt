' ' When did your father teach you that ? ' ' his mother asked Michael , who ' d never played anything before . When he kept insisting he hadn ' t learned it from his father but was playing it by ear , his exasperated mother sent him to bed without supper - until Dad came home and confirmed the tot ' s story. // Nobody hearing one of Mr. Feinstein ' s sparkling supper-club performances today will doubt that his early promise has been richly realized . Still playing and singing by ear , he presides at the keyboard like a blithe spirit of the ' 30s and ' 40s , deftly ushering in the music of that period with a grace and aplomb that not only have garnered raves in the United States , but have earned him a London debut to be made in July . His record and cassette ' ' Pure Gershwin ' ' ( Parnassus label ) - a sleeper hit - is steadily broadening his audience . ' ' Live at the Algonquin , ' ' a new record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feinstein on the jacket , has just been released . Among his other dates , he performs next year in the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in an all-Gershwin program. // // For many young people , meanwhile , Feinstein is a bridge to a world the rock era has largely overlooked : a gentler age of memorable melodies and gemlike lyrics. // ' ' Younger people are turning more and more to this other kind of music , because they ' re getting the things they need from it , ' ' Feinstein told me as we sat in the fabled Algonquin lobby , near that hotel ' s Oak Room where he was performing twice a night. // ' ' Gershwin and Rodgers and Kern and Vernon Duke , Harold Arlen - they all wrote music that affects people in the heart , in addition to having 40 years of memories connected with them . It ' s therapeutic . Their songs are written to create the effect of joy and enthusiasm . . . . // ' ' I think contemporary music reflects what ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we now have chaotic music - music with values on the beat instead of the lyric - or dissonant music , or punk , or whatever . But many young people are realizing that there is a different type of music that helps them express another part of their personality. // ' ' Music affects people more than they realize . I always perform with the intention of reaching the hearts of people , of creating some sort of harmony in their lives. ' ' // Feinstein ' s theories come delightfully to life in his performances . At a recent session in the mellow ambiance of the Oak Room he had a sophisticated audience both amused and entranced as he played the piano and sang into the mike , wearing a smile that seemed to say this is what life is all about . His clear , refreshingly unaffected voice delivered songs like Gershwin ' s ' ' Someone to Watch Over Me , ' ' ' ' Our Love Is Here to Stay , ' ' and ' ' ' S Wonderful ' ' with a boyish elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He grinned fondly at some of the gymnastic lyrics ( ' ' S ' exceptionelle , ' ' ' ' s ' no bagatelle ' ' ) like an amused parent at a child doing somersaults , but the heart of the numbers remained glowingly intact in his reverent hands . And Feinstein linked the songs in a chain of comments ( ' ' I know what you ' re thinking - they don ' t write them like that anymore ' ' ) , anecdotes ( including snippets of his own life story ) , and modest jokes that place the music in its show-business setting . After finishing Gershwin ' s ' ' Embraceable You , ' ' he introduced Ginger Rogers , who first sang the song in the 1930 Broadway musical ' ' Girl Crazy. ' ' // Feinstein ' s winning style springs from a single-minded commitment to show tunes that has been a theme throughout his life and career . His virtually encyclopedic knowledge of the field was extensive enough to earn him the friendship and admiration of the late Ira Gershwin , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together cataloging the Gershwin oeuvre. // At one point , Feinstein recalls , ' ' I was cataloging his phonograph records , and I was humming the verse of an obscure song called ' Beginner ' s Luck . ' Ira ' s back was to me , and he was reading the paper , and he kind of froze . He wheeled around in his swivel chair and said , ' Mike , that ' s the verse of ' ' Beginner ' s Luck ' ' ! I wrote that with George . How do you know it ? ' // ' ' I said , ' Well , I know a lot of your songs . ' Then he started quizzing me , and he became amazed . He started telling me stories and giving me pieces of sheet music . He would play me a record and say , ' What ' s wrong with this interpretation ? ' It was a lot of fun. ' ' // Feinstein remembers vividly the time he was first bitten by the Gershwin bug . It was while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My parents had purchased this Andre Kostelanetz album , and one of the bands was the main theme from ( Gershwin ' s ) ' Rhapsody in Blue . ' I had never heard music that did what that music did to my insides , and I thought , ' What is this ? I want to find out more about it . ' From there I started listening to as much Gershwin music as I could find. ' ' // The first steps toward a career came when Feinstein left high school . ' ' It was an important time , because I didn ' t know what in the world I was going to do with my life . . . . I worked at Ohio State University playing improvisational music for dance classes. ' ' // Confused and directionless , Feinstein moved to Los Angeles when he was 20 . ' ' I had never been there , ' ' he says . ' ' I don ' t know why , to this day , I decided to move there , except I feel there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe very strongly that we are all guided by a divine power that is always giving us information if we can pick up on it , that sometimes filters through to our consciousness . But I find that sometimes we have to work toward getting the information that ' s given to us. ' ' // After making the fateful Ira Gershwin connection , Feinstein says , ' ' I performed from time to time , and eventually started playing at Beverly Hills parties , where I discovered I had something important . . . . I would know an obscure Gershwin song , and people kept saying , ' How do you know these songs ? ' It made me aware that what I always thought was a weakness - in concentrating on this older material - was actually a strength. ' ' // But after Ira ' s passing in 1983 , Feinstein ' s life hit another low point . Because of a legal dispute , he had to stop his work on the Gershwin material. // Then in February of 1983 , he started performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Liza Minnelli started to come in to see me , ' ' he remembers . Minnelli threw a party so Feinstein could become better known . Several celebrities saw his obvious gifts and took him under their wings . From then on his reputation began to grow. // At some point , Feinstein says , he ' d like to sing the works of a different composer entirely - himself . ' ' I ' m writing music , ' ' he says , ' ' and eventually I hope to perform my own work . Primarily music - I ' m less adept lyrically . I ' m working at it , though. ' ' // //
