When a savings and loan crisis hit Maryland last week , depositors knew all too well what to do . They gathered up their lawn chairs , thermos bottles and portable radios and lined up outside the banks as if they were embarking on a familiar American outing . In a sense , they were . Only two months ago , depositors across the U.S. witnessed scenes right out of the Great Depression during a panic that temporarily shut down Ohio 's 69 privately insured thrifts . At the time , Governor Richard Celeste warned several other states that they should prepare for similar events . " You 're sitting on a time bomb , " he told Maryland Governor Harry Hughes . <P> The panic indeed exploded in Maryland last week , prompting Hughes to seize emergency control of his state 's 102 privately insured thrifts .

Federal regulators moved quickly to help . The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation , a U.S. agency that guarantees deposits up to $100,000 , sent an army of auditors to Maryland to rush the process of bringing many of the thrifts under its coverage .
