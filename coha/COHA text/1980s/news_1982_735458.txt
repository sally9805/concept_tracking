txt In a remote village 30 miles south of this parched south-central marketing center , Alion Gueye takes a break from a long day of hoeing , sits down in his thatched-roof but and chronicles an African farmer 's complaints . Under the government-run agricultural system here in Senegal , farm prices are set so low there is little ' real incentive to grow more . Seeds and fertilizer frequently are n't delivered until after the rainy season . The quality of both often is poor . Buyers regularly cheat in weighing the crops at sale time . Marketing is undependable . Years ago , before the state took over , Mr. Gueye says , " Everybody would try to plant more than the next farmer . Now , everyone settles for growing the same . " Mr. Gueye , a farmer of groundnuts , is n't the only one who is down on the home-grown system of state-run agriculture that prevails throughout much of sub-Sahara Africa . the cluster of 45 countries located between the Sahara Desert and the continent 's southern tip . The World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time takes sub-Sahara countries to task , not only for their agricultural systems but also for a broad array of economic policies that the bank and its sister organization , the International Monetary Fund , contend are stifling incentives and impeding economic development . Bulging Bureaucracies True , there is increasing evidence that economies in the region are changing . More and more of the continent 's countnes are beginning to edge away from some of the socialist methods they adopted in the 1960s and toward more market-oriented techniques . Marxist governments in Angola and Guinea , for example , recently have begun courting foreign investment  --  a step they shunned only a few years ago . And Senegal has made even broader changes to streamline its bureaucracy , reduce subsidies and transfer some government-run programs back to the private sector . But the progress is slow , with countries such as Tanzania and Ghana remaining firmly in the Marxist camp . So much still must be done that analysts say it may be years before the results begin to show . Indeed . despite the changes in Senegal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has refused to disburse the second phase of a $30 million loan here . The economic sins that Westerners complain about in sub-Sahara Africa are wideranging : Sharply overvalued exchange rates in many countries push production costs higher and make it harder to export ; bulging bureaucracies and costly subsidies are pushing governments deep into debt ; artificially low farm prices are discouraging agricultural production ; and taxation policies and importexport restrictions are stifling trade . Mr. Clausen 's Warning Socialist economic techniques together with periodic droughts , falling commodity prices and high world-wide interest rates have turned the region into an economic nightmare . World Bank figures show that during the 1970$ , output per person rose more slowly here than in any other region . Of the 30 countries classified as the " poorest of the poor , " two-thirds are African . In seven of these , agricultural output is on the decline . Death rates here are the highest in the world . And economic projections for the 1980s are grimmer still . The situation looks so bleak that the World Bank has made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s . Bank President A.W . Clausen has called for a near-quadrupling of lending by 1990 to sub-Sahara countries , from the present $4.9 billion a year to $17.8 billion . Few believe Mr. Clausen can achieve his new lending target , but he has promised to channel an increasing proportion of the 143-country institution 's resources to the region . Mr. Clausen also has warned African governments that unless they improve their own performance ? by concentrating more on boosting agricultural production and spurring more exports  --  donor countries may get impatient . The Reagan administration already has told developing countries they 'll have to rely more on " the magic of the marketplace "  --  and less on direct aid  --  to spur their economic growth . Black-Market Sales The problems here in Senegal , a nation of 5% million people , are fairly representative of those in many sub-Saharan countries . After 22 years of independence from France , Senegal 's government-run economy clearly is a dream gone sour . Output is stagnating , food production is n't keeping pace with population growth and the tax structure works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy and widespread subsidies are plunging the country deeper into debt . Public and priiate borrowing has soared to $1 billion  --  from less than a third that figure only a few years ago . Senegal has some 1,000 separate staterun cooperatives covering everything from phosphate and fertilizer production to railroads , petroleum , pharmaceuticals , utilities and cement-manufacturing . All but the petroleum and phosphate operations are losing money  --  and sapping the government 's budget . Concedes Mamadou Toure , Senegal 's planning minister : " The cooperative have n't been a big success . " By far the most glaring shortcoming . though . is in agriculture . There has n't been any real incentive for Senegal 's farmers . who account for 80% of the country 's employment , to increase their production ; Over the years , government officials here and in most African countries have kept farmers ' prices low ; in part , that policy exists to ease the burden for urban dwellers , who increasingly have held the political leverage . Those farmers who can do so often sell part of their crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . What gives authorities hope here is that Senegal has begun moving to correct some of these problems . In an ambitious new program , Senegalese President Abdou Diouf has abolished the country 's biggest agricultural cooperative , known as Oncad , and replaced it with six smaller regional models that he hopes will be more efficient . Officials of 12 big nonagricultural state cooperatives have been ordered to sign contracts to meet efficiency goals . And Mr. Diouf has begun to transfer some of the country 's debtridden fishing and **28;1195;TOOLONG operations to private owners . The administration also has sharply limited civil-service payrolls and government wage increases . And it has begun a major push to attract foreign investors . Senegal now has the only functioning free-trade zone in the sub-Sahara . Senegal also has begun moving to reduce costly subsidies and raise incentives for increasing farm production . Farmers complain that agricultural prices are still too low . But over the past few years , prices for groundnuts  --  Senegal 's most important crop  --  have almost doubled . Rice prices are up 31.3% ; wheat flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 25% . In an astonishing move to trim the budget deficit the administration has assessed workers a head tax equivalent to a full month 's wages . To top that off , . the country has undergone an involuntary currency devaluation : The West African franc , the currency of Senegal and several other countries in the region , is tied to the French franc and has plunged to 345 to the U.S. dollar , from 240 a year ago . Says a staffer from one - international lending institution : " If we 'd suggested that ourselves , they 'd never have listened to us . " The results have occasionally been dramatiC . In the capital city of Bakar , business man Matar Nidaye bought a government-operated fish-packing plant that had been run into the ground . Managed haphazardly by administrators from the fisheries ministry , the factory had amassed an oversized work force and a $3.4 million debt . Today , after a year - of steady- belt-tightening , Mr. Nidaye has more than doubled previous sales volume , wiped out the debt and begun investing in modern equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the former banker says . But Senegalese leaders concede that , Mr. Nidaye 's example aside , it may be several years ' , afore the new policies produce widely visible results . And the Diouf government is balking at additional demands by the World Bank and the IMF to increase rice and fertilizer prices further , overhaul the current seed-distribution system and impose a stiff new import duty to help trim the balance-of-payments deficit . The planning ministry 's Mr. Toure pleads : " If we triple the price of rice , we 'll have riots . " The fact that Senegal 's new measures have n't sparked riots is a testimony partly to President Diouf 's political skills and partly to the country 's general political stability . Recent efforts by Morocco and the Sudan to increase prices paid to farmers sparked demonstrations by consumers in those country 's crowded cities . The Senegalese government has helped keep ' tensions down by explaining its steps thoroughly ? and moving gradually . Senegal 's finance minister , Ousmane Seck , says for now , the government will limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing operations , rather than wholesale transfers to the private sector . " The backbone of our economy would collapse if we went any faster , " he says . " It would create a social atmosphere that would jeopardize the political stability of this country . And when a country is unstable , no development is possible . " But many analysts agree that even if the African governments follow everything the World Bank and the IMF prescribe , in exchange for more aid , there still will be problems . Senegal , for instance , has a shortage of experienced managers capable of running private-sector businesses . " You ca n't expect the same bureaucrats who have messed up a publicly run business to make a success out of a private firm , " says one businessman hete . Another problem is that after years of socialism , many Africans simply are n't attuned to the Western system of profits and incentives . In another village near Kaolack , U.S. aid official Peter Halpert coaxed local farmers into setting up a privately run vegetable-farming operation and even helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for irrigation . From a business standpoint , the venture was an unqualified success : Sales to neighboring villages earned the group a profit of 200,000 West African francs the first year  --  only a little more than $800 but a windfall in this economy . But when Mr. Halpert was transferred to another hamlet the next year , the village abandoned the project . Says Ibra N'Daye , a 30-year-old farmer who took part in the effort : " Pulling up all that water was very tedious without a pump . We just did n't want to keep it up . " Authorities concede that moving toward a market-oriented policy does n't guarantee an African country rapid improvement . The impact " would depend upon the country . In some countries , it would n't make any difference at all , " says Elliot Berg , a University of Michigan economist who drafted the World Bank 's sub-Sahara policy report . But Many Africa-watchers believe the continent finally may have reached a turning point . " People in African countries do n't really care about socialism  --  they care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the director of Senegal 's National School of Applied Economics . " I used to believe in socialist theories , but failure has changed my mind , " he says . " Instead of freeing people , socialism has reduced their capacity . to produce . People are readyto reject it . "
