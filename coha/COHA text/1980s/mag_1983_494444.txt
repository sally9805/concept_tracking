THE LEBANON STRATEGY Every policy needs an objective , a strategy , and the means to carry it out . Following the U.S. air raid on Syrian antiaircraft positions in Lebanon , it is clear that the Reagan Administration has the first two . But the losses incurred in the air attack , in lives , planes , and political support at home , raise the question of whether it has the last , The American objective in Lebanon is crystal clear , despite the relentlessly reiterated complaint of the critics that we do n't know what we 're doing there . The aim is simply to ensure the survival of a pro-Western government in Beirut . There is nothing extraordinary about such a policy . It characterizes American foreign policy everywhere . Lebanon is particularly weak and beleaguered , but no less important to the United States than , say , South Korea , where it has invested infinitely more resources and prestige . ( It is worth remembering that this pro-Western government in Lebanon came into being as a direct result of Israel 's war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its present precarious state is in large part a result of severe American pressure at that time to prevent Israel from finishing the job of subduing Syrian and other antigovernment forces . Israel 's actions created an opportunity for the United States ; American policy now is to try to seize it . ) But objectives are n't enough . One needs a strategy to realize them . The perception of incoherence in American policy is derived from the fact that the Marines on the ground in Beirut and the ships offshore seemed unsuited , in fact unrelated , to our aims in Lebanon ( frequently misrepresented by the Administration as " peacekeeping " ; see " The Peacekeeping Fraud , " TNR , November 14 ) . Things are different now . There are many criticisms that can be leveled against the Administration 's current policy in Lebanon , but not that it lacks a strategy . After the Marinemassacre , and after consultation with Israel 's Prime Minister Shamir and Lebanon 's President Gemayel , it has now clearly emerged : strategic cooperation with Israel , a broadened government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goal is to preserve the Beirut government and to extricate the Marines . These two are linked . A withdrawal without securing one 's minimal objective has only one name : defeat . Even those Administration critics most unhappy with the original decision to send the Marines to Beirut recognize that a unilateral withdrawal would be very costly for America in the Middle East and elsewhere . That 's why a wary Congress approved stationing the Marines for up to eighteen months in Beirut . The Gemayel government is dependent on and supported by the United States . It is also friendly to the West , and thus a member of a distinct minority of third world governments . If it is allowed to fall to Syria , whose official dispatches refer to the United States as " the permanent enemy , " that would be bad not only for our friends in Lebanon , but for friends elsewhere who might be persuaded that relying on the United States is both unwise and dangerous . One virtue of the current strategy is that it recognizes that there are two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . At the national level , it is clear that President Gemayel must expand the base of his government . He undoubtedly hears that advice several times a day , and he certainly heard it in Washington from President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz . The advice is simple , but given Mr. Gemayel 's lethargy , it bears reiteration : he needs to bring into his government Druse , Shiite , and other dissident elements if it is to have the stability it needs to survive and to resist outside pressures . Perhaps a bold stroke is needed , such as a declaration that he will undertake a new national census and redistribute power accordingly , or hold elections for the same purpose . Whatever the mechanism , he must be persuaded that the only route to national reconciliation is power sharing , That means that Mr. Gemayel must be prepared to satisfy the domestic claims of his opponents . Instead he 's been preoccupied with regional ones . The national reconciliation conference in Geneva labored for days and issued one result : a declaration that Lebanon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Druse and Moslems and Christians in Lebanon is not over who is more Arab than whom . It is over power , offices , and spoils . The only people interested in the Arab character of Lebanon are the Syrians . What they mean by " national reconciliation " in Lebanon is a Lebanon under Syrian control , cool to the West and hostile to Israel . ( Many in the West see it Syria 's way , and think that abrogation of the May 17 , 1983 , Lebanese-Israeli accord is what " national reconciliation " in Lebanon is all about . ) In fact , the Druse , Shiites , and other domestic opponents of Mr. Gemayel have no inherent stake in such a position . They are forced into supporting it by their military and political dependence on Syria . The Syrians not only have little sympathy for the domestic claims of Mr. Gemayel 's opponents , they also have reason to fear them : if the Lebanese factions came to a true national reconciliation , the first thing they would probably decide is to invite all foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a consummation not to be desired in Damascus . Hence Syria 's strategy in Geneva of preventing all discussion of domestic accommodation until its regional interests ? absorption of Lebanon into Syria 's sphere of influence , abrogation of the treaty with Israel and of close relations with the United States ? are satisfied . None of the local players in Lebanon , neither Mr. Gemayel nor any of his factional opponents , is able to handle that kind of pressure . And yet a true domestic arrangement is impossible until that pressure is counteracted . This can be done only by regional players , Israel and the United States . Hence strategic cooperation . After Israel 's withdrawal from central Lebanon , the United States stepped into the breach as protector of the Lebanese government , but after the Marine massacre had second thoughts about trying to do it alone . Strategic cooperation means that Israel and the United States will try to support each other , a far cry from the situation of only six months ago , when an American Marine who waved a pistol at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the Israeli air strike coming just three days after the Shamir visit , and followed on the next day by the American attack . These were designed to do more than knock out antiaircraft positions . Their purpose was to demonstrate that strategic cooperation is not just a paper agreement . It can mean something on the ground . The idea is to confront Syria with what Secretary Shultz calls the " half-loaf " strategy : we tell Syria that we areprepared to tolerate its existing dominance over half of Lebanon , but only half . It 's not a radical strategy . It aims merely to ratify the status quo that Syria has been intent on overthrowing since September , when it began stirring up the Lebanese civil war to bring down the Gemayel government . Only if Syria is neutralized can there be any hope of a domestic arrangement in Beirut , and neither Israel nor the United States has the stomach to do the job alone . Will it succeed ? It has a far greater chance of succeeding than the original strategy , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon and restoring complete sovereignty and territorial integrity . That is still a desirable goal , and would have been an attainable one under the May 17 agreement , whereby Israel agreed to leave Lebanon if Syria did too . It is now , however , impossible . Syria has no intention of leaving its half of Lebanon , and , emboldened by the passivity and weakness of its adversaries , has decided to go after the other half . But there is no guarantee that the first American air strike ever on Arab forces ( if we except the nonserious engagement in the Gulf of Sidra in 1981 ) will persuade Syria to be content with the status quo . For one thing , it is not clear who " Syria " is anymore , since President Assad has apparently come down with Yuri Andropov 's cold . But whoever is in charge in Damascus , it is not clear that he will be impressed by the American air strike . We come now to the crucial question of means . AMERICAN air strike with no losses is a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , one pilot dead , and one captured is a message to Washington . If the only way to carry out a policy of neutralizing Syria militarily is to engage in a costly war of attrition , the United States will certainly lose . Whatever little political support there is for the strategy will disappear as domestic pressure to disengage mounts . The real problem with the current policy is at the operational level . Israel 's astonishing success using American weapons against Syrian air defenses in the ' 82 war fostered the belief that American forces would meet with similar success . Hence the shock ( Thomas Friedman 's characterization in The New York Times of the Lebanese reaction ) at the loss of two planes in a single American air action against Syrian positions . ( Israel has lost a total of three planes in hundreds of sorties against Syria since June 1982 . ) What are the Americans lacking ? For one thing , experience . Israeli military experts point out that the Syrian positions in Lebanon have the densest concentration of antiaircraft weaponry in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because every second one contains a gun or hides a missile battery . Lack of experience is a curable problem , however . The A-6E and A-7E aircraft that are the backbone of the Navy 's carrier force may not be . These planes are bomb haulers , lumbering trucks that are slow , unmaneuverable , and extremely vulnerable to attack . " They are not obsolete as aircraft ? they are obsolete as concepts , " says Edward Luttwak ( Forbes , April 11 , 1983 ) . " The attack aircraft was the product of a kind of cultural expectation of air superiority , as if having air supremacy over the battlefield was the birthright of any American military force . , . . The Navy saw it as a truck . But if you go against a real air defense , the A-6 and the A-7 just do n't survive . They do n't come home . " Israeli doctrine holds that all attack aircraft should be able to defend themselves . For example , Israel used American made F-16s that travel at more than twice the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But F-16s can not be used from carriers , and the Navy 's F/A-18 , a fast and maneuverable fighter bomber , is not yet available . It 's been held up by those in the Navy and the " small ? and simple ? is beautiful " school of defense critics who oppose weapons with too many missions and too much fancy technology . These are old problems , and will not be solved in time for the war in Lebanon . For now , the only alternatives seem to be to try to adapt the carrier based F-14 fighters to drop perhaps light , " smart " bombs in future ground attacks , or to rely exclusively on offshore naval guns ( the New Jersey 's 16-inch guns can hurl a Volkswagen from Washington to Baltimore ) . To continue to use and lose A-6s and A-7s is a recipe for disaster : it will demoralize domestic American support and , if anything , convince Syria to prolong the fighting . It is ironic that the weakness of the current policy of the United States ? the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most basic operational level . It is nonetheless true . And no matter how legitimate the objectives or coherent the strategy , Administration policy is now dependent on the ability of the military to translate it into action . There is no guarantee that the military will be able to do so and that Syria will be convinced that a deal with the United States and Israel is preferable to a long , mutually costly confrontation . Nevertheless , there is no plausible alternative other than unilateral American withdrawal . Senator Gary Hart , for example , professes a preference for political and diplomatic , as opposed to military , means to solve the current problem . It is not a serious position , Without the Marines , the New jersey , and the aircraft carriers , and without the Israeli Army in South Lebanon , political and diplomatic negotiations over Lebanon 's future would be short indeed . They could be conducted in one afternoon and one room in Damascus , and the Syrians could do it all by themselves .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
