What do such people have in common ? While otherwise engaged , they can listen to a book - recorded on cassette tape . Right now , thousands of people like them are discovering a whole new area of enjoyment , that of hearing books read aloud. // Books on cassette aren ' t exactly new , but their popularity is definitely on the upswing . High school teachers discovered years ago that a cassette of a well-dramatized story - say an Edgar Allan Poe tale - may be the key to getting a whole English class excited about literature. // In a few cities and towns and on several college campuses , libraries have been building tape collections , which have proven quite popular with adults as well as students . The recordings don ' t necessarily take the place of reading books and aren ' t designed for the use of the blind . In fact , they are often enjoyed by the most avid readers , some of whom like to listen when they can ' t be reading . Old-time radio fans are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape . Depending on interest and taste , one can find a classic like Charles Dicken ' s ' ' A Christmas Carol , ' ' a current title like ' ' The Art of Japanese Management , ' ' a book from the New Testament , a Shakespeare play , a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt , or a gripping mystery . Poetry fans can listen to Robert Penn Warren reading his own works. // Although the audio-cassette tape made its appearance in the mid-1960s , books weren ' t recorded in earnest till the ' 70s . Now an estimated 60 percent of Americans have cassette players in their cars , and 75 million to 80 million have them in their homes , according to one books on cassette company owner . These numbers , together with the recent boom in compact , portable players with earphones , suggest to some tapemakers that the market is just beginning . There are no known figures for the numbers of companies . But a number of firms , many of them small operations that aren ' t even listed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest firms , The Mind ' s Eye , in San Francisco , started 10 years ago . The company originally produced dramatized adaptations of books primarily for schools . Its founder , Bob Lewis , who has a PhD in English literature , selected the books and adapted them into scripts . He ' s still selecting and writing , although the company has grown considerably. // In a telephone interview , Dr. Lewis explained that the listening audience has changed over the decade from an academic to a more general one . The Mind ' s Eye is now choosing books to appeal to commuters , postal workers ( who are allowed to listen on the job ) , homemakers , students , and especially to families that may be looking for a new kind of entertainment for car trips . The Mind ' s Eye features dramatized recordings of abridged works , and its products are being marketed in bookstores this fall for the first time. // Recorded Books , in Clinton , Md. , has a different story to tell . Sales manager Sandy Spencer says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Books lists over 150 titles in its catalog , varying from classics to best sellers . The company was started by a traveling salesman , Henry Trenton , who wanted to do more reading but couldn ' t . He called up a California distributor to order tapes of a book to listen to on the road . Soon he and a friend launched their own recording and distribution company. // Recorded Books uses a single reader for an entire text - usually an experienced actor , who , rather than dramatizing the work , simply strives to suggest the characters and to become the author ' s voice , speaking directly to the listener . Some listeners prefer this style of recording to a dramatic rendering. // Recorded Books not only sells but rents out its cassettes . Rental offers significant savings . For example , the seven-cassette package of Judith Guest ' s novel ' ' Second Heaven ' ' sells for $67. 35 . To rent the set for 30 days costs $11. 20 . Recorded Books has a toll-free telephone number for handling orders and can deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Caedmon , which for many years produced the finest-quality spoken LPs available , featuring every subject from plays , poetry , and essays to speeches and letters . Caedmon has quite naturally moved into cassettes in a big way . One of its catalogs , the Spoken-Word Classic series , contains over 300 titles . The current catalog of new recordings , which also contains a backlist of best sellers , includes an extensive list of children ' s books . These recordings range from one individual reading to a full cast. // Caedmon recordings are available only for sale ; there is no rental program . They are available in many book and record stores . The company features attractive offerings for libraries , so their tapes are also available there in some areas. // Books on Tape , in Newport Beach , Calif. , started in 1974 and now offers over 800 full-length recordings of popular best sellers . For example , it offers Robert Ludlam ' s international-intrigue thriller ' ' The Parsifal Mosaic , ' ' which takes 27 hours to play . This set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renting for $4. 50 a part. // Books on Tape offerings are mostly recorded by a single reader . Selections in the catalog include not only books but seminars on business and other subjects , foreign language training , self-improvement - even auto-travel tapes keyed to US National Parks . With such a varied selection , it ' s not surprising that the company has some 25 , 000 customers. // Now 27 hours of one book may sound like too much . However , for a postal worker who doesn ' t have to apply full concentration to routine tasks , it may be only a week ' s involvement . A two-hour-per-day commuter could be occupied for two weeks . But the problem is , once one gets into a book it ' s very hard to put it down , or , in this case , turn it off. // //
