Improving night vision could be an important advance in highway safety , since 55 percent of traffic fatalities occur after dark , even though only 28 percent of driving is done then . Safety officials say one of the biggest problems is that people tend to " overdrive " their headlights - go faster than warranted by the distance illuminated . By the time an obstacle comes into view , there is not enough distance to stop. // With conventional headlights , a typical driver can see a person in dark clothes at 300 feet , according to engineers at the General Motors Corporation ' s Technical Center . Using an experimental night vision system adapted from military technology , the engineers say that person would be visible 1 , 600 feet away - more than five times the distance. <> <> // Infrared rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths slightly longer than visible red light . The most useful infrared wavelengths are from 8 to 12 microns , or millionths of a meter . Visible light is from four-tenths to seven-tenths of a micron. // Because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sensor responsive to those wavelengths can put together a heat picture of objects in its view . That picture can be translated into an image on a video screen. // These heat pictures are not exactly the same as those produced by visible light . Different objects emit different amounts of light at the same temperature , depending upon the characteristics of their surfaces . But heat pictures are usually good enough to produce useful images . The equipment is sensitive enough to detect temperature differences as little as one-tenth of a degree Centigrade. // " It all depends on the temperature and emissivity of the objects involved , " said Harvey A. Burley , an engineer in G.M. ' s advanced product engineering group. // There are enough differences in the temperatures and emissivities of most objects to form relatively detailed pictures of what is in front of a car driving down a road , the engineers say . " The road , the grass beside the road , the light pole alongside the road are all slightly different when you image , " Mr. Burley said. <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera except that its lenses are made of materials like germanium that are transparent to infrared radiation and the image is focused on a silicon chip treated to make it infrared-sensitive. // The chip has been crosshatched into thousands of different picture elements , or pixels . The differing amounts of radiation falling on each pixel produces a different voltage . The image-processing system sweeps rapidly across the chip to " read " the shifting pattern of voltages and convert that information to a moving image on a televisionlike screen. // Infrared sensors developed for military use are often linked to a " lamp " that shines a beam in the 10-micron range at likely targets to create a reflection . The systems being tested by G.M. , though , are passive . Rather than illuminating objects , they simply measure what is received through the optical system. // In the experimental vehicles being evaluated by G.M. , the night vision pictures are displayed on a cathode ray tube that has a flattened screen and is capable of simple color displays . Engineers anticipate that such displays will replace the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infrared system is ready for introduction. // One experimental project has the tube replacing the instruments in the center of the dashboard . The driver controls the display on the tube by selecting from a menu of options at the edge of the image . The selection is made by using switches on the center pad of the steering wheel . The switches function like cursor controls on a word processor , allowing the driver to move up , down or sideways on the menu by pressing an arrow . The options include heating and cooling controls , gauges , radio , cellular telephone and the vision system. // In most of the displays , the time , speed and fuel gauge are shown across the top of the screen for easy viewing . When the night vision screen is called up , they drop to the bottom of the display so the driver can immediately see what is in front of the auto. <> <> // G.M. ' s night vision system is a long way from being put into use . The infrared mechanism is so large that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to a car ' s roof . One reason is that the sensor chip is cooled to 70 degrees Kelvin , or 70 degrees above absolute zero , by liquid nitrogen . The cooling is necessary to supress the electromagnetic interference , or " noise , " emitted by the system itself due to its own heat . Indeed , representatives of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation said they considered such technology so far from practical automotive application that they were not paying much attention to it. // But G.M. ' s engineers said that military needs were forcing the pace of technology development in infrared imaging and that the benefits of those advances would spill over into civilian uses . G.M. ' s link to military development is through its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. <> <> // Developments in semiconductors may make uncooled systems practical within a few years , Mr. Burley said . " It may be possible to use a semiconductor with an amplifier on every element " as the key sensor in an uncooled system if present development trends continue , according to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , the engineers concede , it may not be possible to reduce the costs of infrared imaging systems to the point where they would be practical in a family car. // But with cars becoming more alike in size and design , top auto company executives are looking increasingly to electronics for features that will distinguish one model from another . A reasonably priced night vision option that combines a " gee whiz " factor with practical advances in safety would fit that description nicely. //
