39 A story by Jane Hamilton am 671d AM the Bennie they write about . My Aunt Ruth came to stay for a week and she brought with her a small packet of Mother 's letters ( and she bemoaned the fact that somehow she had thrown out all the others , or mislaid them ) and then last Thursday I was going through some boxes from the farm and I found some notebooks of Dad 's and this story or reflection was one of the few things that was in ink and not smeared . He almost always wrote in pencil , which is hopeless after two months . It floors me  --  this sort of old-fashioned romance my parents carried on . It was only fifteen years ago ? 1967 ? but still this kind of thing , it seems to me , would not happen today . Had my mother left the farm in 1982 she would surely stay in the city , become a flannel-suit sort of person in a publishing house , and never marry again but carry on with this one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then but she would not let herself entertain the notion of crawling back to the farm on all fours , her tail between her legs . My father believed all along that a tide of faith and goodness would sweep them back together . I am the Bennie Sara and Will write about . I am still trying to connect the child they write about with myself . It astounds me that I am the one who was toted around in a crusted Volkswagen for a year , although I do vaguely remember Maine and the isJane Hamilton lives with her husband on a farm in Wisconsin . This is her first published story . land and the nursery school in West Virginia and the little girl , Sally , whom we lived with in the winter . My memories are shapeless but never , surprisingly enough , grim . I remember the feel of my father and how he held me against the dark prairie of his chest . I was not afraid of never seeing my mother again . I knew , just as my father knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We had to get over this hump of a year before we came to our senses  --  my mother had to exhaust her fantasy of dancing with three hundred thousand men and my father had to parade around in foreign lands to know what was priceless to him . I think all along my father wanted to practice something Thoreau said about perfecting his nation 's culture by his own fireside . And I think my mother decided that he should have a little struggle , that everything had come too easily for him : farm , wife , baby . I attribute the fact that my mother wrote bitter poems to her tender age and grand delusions . I say this from my perch of twenty-one . But I do n't know any of this . I have pieced together what I want to believe from a dozen or so scraps . I do know that sometimes I have the urge to run through the lunch-hour crowds chasing two figures that are just beyond my reach . I want to find my parents and shout at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clasp their hands and wave a banner and crown them with laurels . But the farm is gone and they are gone and I am left with this scrap of my father 's journal and a small packet of my mother 's letters . 42 F I WRITE about myself as if I am simply a character in a story I am distanced from my own small misfortune . It is as if I am a cow in the barnyard , standing in my own sweet filth , and suddenly with a torrent of rain I am washed clean . For a moment , at least , this is how I see Bennie and Sara and someone who is me , called Will : Will imagined the moment Sara left and all his travels afterward as scenes , each scene a window , as if his story were a Christmas story or an Easter story portrayed in a series of department-store windows . A full year had passed since Sara left them . Will and Bennie . Last March , a year ago , he remembered how she used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the bare trees , each pair making their own arch to the sky . Even if he made no sound when he came in after the chores she would feel his presence , or perhaps she smelled sheep and billygoat , manure and hay  --  in any case , she would move quickly to the record player and turn off her music and start to the sink with frenzied motions as if she were a rabid cat in the heat of July . She would slink up the loft stairs with ears flat against her head , as if by pasteurizing milk on the stove for fifteen minutes he was bent on destroying her meager solitude . He had always thought they were really just children . He fantasized about their being Russian gypsies in the forest playing hide-and-seek among the trees , but always there was the cauldron steaming and they would come back to it , refreshed and happy . Her departure went like this : she came out to him in the field when he was plowing in early spring . She had her Boy Scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knowing only that there were seagulls following the plow , eating the worms he was turning over in the earth . She must have shouted at him over and over again , because he heard her but did n't know what it was , seeing only the soil turn and the gulls follow . Finally , she ran and scared the gulls away . " Will , " she said breathlessly , " I ca n't anymore . I have to go . I ca n't anymore . Bennie is asleep . " She did not weep as she called to him . " I 'm sorry but I just ca n't do it anymore . " And she ran from the field on down the lane and to the road . Unbelieving , he continued plowing until all the earth was turned , some deep brown , the north end sandy , the west rich black . He walked back to the house slowly , thinking about how his grandfather had plowed this land with a horse and how his fur-trapping great-great-uncle had walked Wisconsin when most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crib sobbing , his nose so runny that Will stuck him in the tub and gave him a full bath . After Sara left , he led a life of " intense rage , " to use her words . He could find nothing in the kitchen because she had rearranged the pots , the bread pans ; where were the potholders , the matches , the scrubbers ; where was the crusted scrub brush , dingy from four years of muddy carrots , that Hilda had given him ? He got in the habit of slamming the cabinet doors . There were three half-filled bottles of molasses , flour all over the floor of the grain shelf , and moths fat with flour or perhaps babies . The loft where Sara and he slept was full of nothing but all her scraps from the multitudinous things she loved to do , or things she thought she ought to do . Some were never finished . She was n't content just sitting I reading a book : she had to be knitting while she was reading or holding a paintbrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps , the next tight with wool left over from hats and scarves and sweaters , mittens and baby booties and blankets . The next was jammed with papers , bits of poems , unused stamped envelopes sent to her by countless political organizations that all pleaded ruin without her contribution . There were also all her books in stacks on the floor , all the books she tried to entice him into . He found himself kicking the ram when the ram charged him ; he was rough with the eggs when he collected them , so that several were broken by the time he got to the house , and once he forgot to feed Bennie lunch and Bennie ran away down the road to his grandfather 's house . Everywhere Will looked there were remnants of Sara . In the sink he found three long black hairs . She did n't have the grace to cover her tracks ; those hairs taunted him . Surely there had to be more of their life together than three solitary hairs glued to the bathroom sink and some drawers full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . Will watched Bennie carry a kitten by the neck or he held Bennie close to him when they slept and he knew that Bennie had not simply sprung from a froth of a wave or been plunked down by some wild long-beaked bird known to deliver babies . He was Will 's . N JUNE Will arranged to rent the farm for a year . He put Bennie in the backseat of the VW with a sack of clothes and apples , and he got himself in the driver 's seat , slammed the door , and drove away without looking back , without waving to the dozens of ancestors who stood on the front stoop . He had left the farm before , during his college years . The thrill of the university and the city wore off after three days . Will spent his freshman year in the library without the beanie they were supposed to wear , reading gardening magazines , novels , some poetry and philosophy , mysteries , fairy tales , sheep bulletins , and once a torrid drugstore novel . He studied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diploma in agriculture he would step back into his real self , his farming self . But in this vagabond year , for the first time in his life , Will stalked adventure , not gingerly but with foam in his mouth , with the same gleam in his eye that a Jehovah 's Witness wears on one 's doorstep . He and Bennie lived in Maine , ate lobster , and built boats ; they picked apples in West Virginia , he worked in a cabinet shop in Richmond , and in the winter they stayed with old friends Tanya and Peter , cooked for the household , and cared for Bennie and Tanya 's little girl , Sally . It was somewhat of an adventure for Will to be a housewife . They were not reckless , they did not fight evil . Will never even smoked a joint  --  they simply went from place to place as if they were on a quest and sometime they might very well come upon just the thing . He wondered if he ought to go straight to Washington or New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least march with the crowds in protest about Vietnam . He had managed to miss all of the wars : he was too young for World War II , he had a hernia at the start of the Korean war , and now he was too old for Vietnam . Yet he remembered something John Donne had written and he felt it  --  how each man 's humiliation was his own . If he were Sara 's age he could shout and march and defy as becomes that age . Will listened quietly and obsessively to the world through his AM transistor . There was nothing more he could do . His year could be catalogued simply as Maine , West Virginia , Richmond , and now spring again , Kentucky . Will was staying with his friend Jim in Kentucky , way up a holler . He was waiting for the red bud to blossom and the peepers to sing from the ooze down the way . He wanted Bennie , who had just turned five , to see the red bud . Bennie sat in the outhouse in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will or Jim came too near he would screech " Aarrrraaaaaaaaah " as he sat on the toilet . One morning a cheetah , the next a tiger , the next a hairy ape , the next an active volcano . He was at the age where he would explain to you that deer meat tasted like malted milk , and spinach leaves were ogre tongues . When Jim , who was a Baptist , told Bennie a story about God the Father , Bennie told Jim it was He the Bennie who had made the world back in Wisconsin . He was at the age where he would tell you to eat his wiener if he got angry or if he temporarily did n't like you . He played Dirty Doctor with Sally in the basement and stuck a harmonica in the crack of her bottom . " A termometer , " he said , when Will startled them one afternoon . One day at the end of apple season last fall , Will was picking winesaps as fast as he possibly could because they were paid by the bushel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was tired by ten in the morning but he could n't stop now . In the frenzy of his epileptic motions he kept hearing Daddy , Daddy , Daddy ... but he dismissed the calls as tired ghosts wandering through his nearly vacant mind.43 The calls came closer and finally arrived at his feet , crying out " Daddy ! " Bennie thumped his head against the ladder again and again and told Will he did n't like him anymore . He had escaped from the nursery school and walked two miles out to the orchards . He just was n't going to be carted around to church buildings where they made you trace daisies and then cut them out and paste them into a paper vase . He was n't going to do that crap anymore . That day Will collected his apple money and his belongings , went to Woolworth 's , bought a kite , and spent the afternoon lying in the grass with Bennie , who held the kite twine in his own two hands . In all these travels , all the faces and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as if he were an old man looking back on something so long ago that it seemed outside himself . There were the small things he longed for , that one phrase of music , that single line of a Handel concerto that Sara used to play , and he hungered for it in a way that a man in war hungers for the soapy smell of his girl , and Will carried the music with him the way his uncle carried in his pocket the spoon he ate with at the ice-cream shop the night before he went back to the trenches ? still crusted with cold hot fudge . There were the larger things he coveted also : he wanted Sara to hide in the pantry from Bennie the way she used to when he was one . She sang in a high-pitched almost whine that sounded like a Japanese harp and it would drive Bennie mad with delight trying to find her . For a long time they could n't understand why Bennie 's first words were high-pitched and utterly nasal . He wanted her to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his noticing . Often he would discover , standing in the line at the bank or at the farmers ' co-op , a clothespin hanging from the crotch of his pants in the back , or from the neck of his sweatshirt . A thousand things . They walked in the woods at night whenever there was a full moon and they climbed to the top of the hill and then they danced . Miss Lucia , their tiger cat , followed them and spoke of such things as beetles and mouse nests as she sat on the hill , watching . They worked together : Will dug holes and filled them with sheep manure and then Sara made the seedbeds and planted the squash seeds or the melons or the pumpkins . He made a trench for the popcorn and she came squatting down the row with the bag of seeds . They ran out , in the cool of an August night , and picked sweet corn and galloped back to the house like a team of workhorses to quick-blanch the corn and scrape it from the cob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lambs when the animals went down to pasture in the summer ; they fell asleep in front of the stove in the winter right after supper ? let the dishes fall away into the deepest pits of hell . They had Bennie between them at the supper table . He was their little fur child , he was their song . 44 ILL REMEMBERED seeing Sara for the first time at the farmers ' market . First she was a customer talking to him about cooking and then all of a sudden she was beside him , giv-:77 /7 ing and receiving change , bundling . broccoli into paper sacks , and telling people how to make raspberry jelly . For years he had made eyes at the slim dark women who stood across the table , across the sea of fruits and vegetables . He grinned at them and stared at them ( and they stared back ) and he held their stare longer than simply meant hello or nice fruit or the mole on your chin has such a blond hair growing from it . But here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sure she might do anything  --  glide across the Rubicon as well as come stand behind his table , It made him feel powerful , having her there ; had she been with him two days before at the supermarket he would have been able to take back the oranges that he realized too late had rotten spots on them . But he had paid for them and standing in the parking lot he had felt too timid to resist . That was what he remembered about meeting her : his sense of power coupled with the dimming memory of once being too timid to do ordinary things . That was before Sara talked about hers instead of theirs , me instead of us , before she ran out into the night without him as if she were fleeing the grasp of a boa constrictor . She had grown tired of her toy husband , her toy farm . because both demanded more work than she could ever have imagined when she first dreamt of the farm life . She had never felt her back in so many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might give out , she had not bargained for life without hot showers . Sara charmed him with the poems she knew by heart and her suitcase plastered with stickers from a dozen airports . But Will realized now that she was perceptive about herself and no one else , that her confidence and maturity were a mannerism only , and that her way , with a running start , was to take a long skid on top of the world . Maybe she no longer respected a man who got up too early each morning and began a day as if there were vengeance in him , as if he must purge himself of a dread disease or an unutterable sin committed when three and a half . But that sounded like the stark language of the Faulkner novel she had read out loud to him . If she had invented this grim tale , well , then , she was wrong . He simply liked to smell the hay and the animals in the early morning , he loved his own strength as he stacked apple boxes before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful than a dewy soybean field just after the first cultivation . It was the rusty cars out in the sheepyard , the grunt a ewe made when she discovered her lamb in a heap of blood and mucus , it was the days when there was so much snow , way up to the backdoor , that you had to stay in and read seedcatalogues and sleep . It was a thousand unsung tasks that woke him up in the black of the night . And there was the other force  --  walking in the kitchen at night he could feel his ancestors around the stove : his great-great-uncle the trapper , his great-grandfather the threshing-machine builder , his grandfather the dairy man , his grandmother the woman who lost seven babies and kept six . They sat and the men smoked pipes and she darned endless socks and they told Will he had planted a little too early , or that he 'd better worm the lambs ; they talked about how it had n't rained enough that year , they talked about the days before apple trees needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them clearly in the steam . He thought of his father haying two years ago and how he tried to throw the bales onto the wagon , He was spent , his hands crooked , his back unforgiving , he could n't see to drive the tractor anymore , and if he could n't throw bales he might just as well be taken out to the burning pile . Throw him on when the next damp day came and the garbage was ready , the winds blowing from the right direction . Will knew his father felt this way . Will looked at his hands ; they were large and strong and he would use them while they lasted . This was the divine scheme . He had always wanted Sara to know this : the strength of his people , the force of the land , more powerful than the single line of Handel . it was a force and a beauty that made death . even his own , inconsequential . He carried his ancestors just as he carried his children , in his blood , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wasting her bones and muscles and joints in a sleazy hamburger caf ? . He did n't realize how troubled she had been until he found a poem , or a scrap , that she had written in one of her notebooks . February 7 I am waiting for the persimmon to ripen . A luxury it owns  --  the swell belly which I will not have by you and I am bitter to the taste a hollow pit chucking out seeds to the wind . I am the old bitch gone in the teeth . He could n't understand this . She had Bennie , after all , he had said out loud . He just could not understand her sense of sterility , and it left him completely bewildered and then he felt as if he had been bitten by a viper for no apparent reason . She left in the spring with no warning . Her rage was no greater than it had been , a sophomoric rage , it had seemed to him . Nevertheless life was even and not unhappy . But the wind changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smelled something mysterious and strong just beyond the horizon . And then she was gone . September 8 , 1960 Ruthie . There are always plenty of adequate words on hand when one feels despondent , depressed , gloomy , woeful , angry , seething , etc. , etc. , but when one is happy , utterly . floating , in rare ecstasy , there are no words to use that do n't sound trite , cutesie-pinksie , etc. , etc . I have not written in my journal for days but those blank pages spell euphoria to me . I am in love with the most stunning man on earth and were he to swipe the David and stand in its place there would be no hullabaloo over the missing masterpiece but great joy over the newfound wonder . He is kind and strong too and smart and he makes me feel as if everything that flows from my ruby lips is a refulgent jewel . I met him in July at the farmers ' market they have here around the capital square . He was selling cattails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking with cattail roots and by and by he got busy with customers and so I boldly jumped in and helped him sell . One thing led to another . We have Saturdays together and then he fires up his truck , a real honker she is , and drives seventy miles back to the farm . I mope in the library and read Russian foktales to console myself . I 'll say no more except that he is thirty-two and he is the first man I 've ever met that I could imagine spending more than seven and a half minutes with . I 'll tell you the details when I see you in two weeks ! ? Come prepared to help your poor dumb sister who is completely mystified by calculus and chemistry . I long to be a Ukrainian Easter egg painter . love , Dear Ruthie , January 12 , 1961 I called Mother to tell her I 'm Mrs. Will Scka and she cried . She told me I 'm too young and don'tmp know my own mind and what about college , and I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful conversation but it 's over . Will is teaching me everything . When he is asleep I look at the fine lines underneath his eyes , a diary of all the days I have not known him , and I think that all the time in the world is not enough time to know him . He is teaching me about sheep and soon we will prune the fruit trees , tree by tree , and then we will plant together , row by row . I am reading George Eliot by the fire . My chemistry lab manual is burning right this minute and keeping me toasty warm ( by a process that is mysterious to me but nonetheless beautiful ) . yourrie ?

I long for the sea in July , or at least a lake . I would gladly settle for a pond , a puddle , an oozing . We are utterly /and/ocked in this Jul wet-heat night- mare . Last night I dreamt of a great white hur-fish , tied by terrific froth3 ' waves ; there were hours of gasping for breath hard h and slapping d down water . I grabbed Will , surely octopus th e on arms , and flailed him about and somewhere in the midst this I felt as if I 'd conceived a child of If ' s true I 'll probably give birth it to a blue gill or Peculation , Not a word to anyone ; a this is pure specul minnow At nineteen I have turned into real hausfrau .

I have my bike through the dark city , have sat on the porch looking out to the lake ( how lucky I w to find this place ) , some friends stopped over with cake and drink and good conversation .

If this is the orgy weekend for you I 'll gladly forgo Isle R maybe next weekend is better . l'm your s Yours but ? A few nights ago something terrible happened , Ruthie . I went to a folk dance and I wore a velvet brown jumper and a crimson grosgrain ribbon in my hair and I felt wild and strong and beautiful . I danced with each man as if he were my own . I was like the old ram finally let into the pasture with the ewes in November : his lip curling up , smelling what must be far better than anything Chanel could ever dream up . I spun with each man down the line in the reel so that the room blurred into a gelatinous realm and there was only that strange mouth and eyes  --  and we were intimate with each other in a way that only strange dancers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I knew him because he was shy and this made me angry and sad , as if he were not allowing me to make love to him . ) After the dance I rode my bicycle home through the cool of the night . My friend Jack was sitting on the steps . He is a high-strung political-science major who I served cream of asparagus soup to one day . He wanted to be a concert pianist but when he realized it was hopeless he decided to study law . He said he had watched me dance . He was very quiet and sort of weepy and I knelt down next to him and put my arms around him and murmured such things as what 's the matter and how can I help . Ruthie , my words put him into a blind rage . ( A drunken rage I might add . ) He jerked himself up and cried out how heartless and insensitive I was and how I was completely selfish and furthermore ignorant about everything political that is going on in the world and on campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would take someone completely irresponsible not to say even deaf , blind , and mute not to become politically involved , His nose was runny and he pouted like a three-year-old and shouted like a fifteen-year-old practicing his first rejection . Finally he shoved me down the stairs and threw a broken wine flask into my face . I just stood there thinking of the intense yellow of the daffodils outside Mother 's flat and I thought of her reading into the night in her nightgown and bed jacket and I wondered for the first time if she was lonely . Jack was a good friend albeit a hysterical one who had just tried to smash my face or blind me , or something , and all I could think of was bright yellow and then the dim yellow of Mother 's night lamp . I think I must have cried out that I was frightened because a neighbor came and then took me right away to the hospital . ( My eyes are fine -- my face a little cut up . ) But for the first time I felt what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying for me . I thought of the young wife in Pound 's poem waiting for her husband and all the pity and terror of it and I felt the horror of bombs flying and white light searing the eyes . I suddenly knew that I did n't want to be alone in this madness . ( And Jack is right , I am not political  --  the whole scene scares me . ) I understand little  --  only that I know Will better than anyone , working next to him , row after row , and that we are partners growing into the earth . I am going back to find him , Ruthie , to be his partner . It is my pledge , it is my promise . a windy morning ; had she been listening to the radio she would have known that there were high-wave alerts .

This probably happened only a few times but I like to think of it as commonplace in my magical , lost childhood . I do remember a real conversation I had with my mother when I was six or seven . I asked her what really happened to us when we died and she said , " We just grow into the earth and all our parts get mixed around and then we climb back up straight to the sky as a beautiful strong oak tree .
