The vote , in which 11 Republicans joined 52 Democrats in supporting the bill , was seen as at least a temporary victory for the White House. // President Reagan has repeatedly said he will veto the bill because it contains a provision requiring companies to provide 60 days ' notice of plant closings or layoffs. // Asked what he would do when the bill reached his desk , President Reagan said , " Just what I promised . " He made the comment as he greeted Canada ' s Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at a state dinner at the White House. // // Labor Pushed for Provision // Organized labor has strongly pushed for the plant-closing provision , which business has opposed as a governmental intrusion in its affairs. // The House approved the bill overwhelmingly last week and is expected to override a veto. // The Democratic leadership in the Senate is expected to continue its lobbying for three more votes , but the prospects of overriding the veto seem unlikely . Roll-call , page D20 . Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri , the ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation , said , " I believe this bill is dead . " The White House is hoping that Congressional leaders will agree to put forward a new trade bill without the plant-closing provision . <> <> Wide Variety of Issues // The bill approved today , nearly three years in the making , is 1 , 000 pages long and contains provisions on a wide variety of issues. // Congressional Democrats warned the Administration not to count on receiving another trade bill that it would find acceptable. // For one thing , they said , it is very difficult to keep amendments out of a reintroduced bill . And some Democrats are expected to try to capitalize on a Reagan veto to make the plant notification issue a political one. // Many Democrats , and some Republican strategists , feel the White House has handed the Democrats a potent political issue by giving such high visibility to plant closings. // " By focusing so much attention on this they have given the Democrats a freebie , " said Norman Ornstein , a scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dole of Kansas , the Republican leader , said , " It puts Republicans on the side , at least the perception out there , of being against the poor working man and woman who get only four-day notice. " // The Senate majority leader , Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , said of the Administration ' s strategy , " Those who gamble on another bill are gambling on a very weak reed . " The Democrats have also suggested that the free-trade agreement with Canada , which is awaiting Congressional approval , could be jeopardized if the President vetoes the trade bill. // But President Reagan told Prime Minister Mulroney that he was confident that Congress would approve the free-trade agreement with Canada , which was signed in January and would end trade barriers between the two countries in the next 10 years . Mr. Mulroney spoke to a joint meeting of Congress , which is expected to vote on the bill during the summer. // A White House spokesman , B.J. Cooper , said , " We ' re encouraged by the vote today . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get responsible trade legislation this year. " // Of the 54 Democrats in the Senate , 52 voted for the bill . Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin , who objects to a provision that reduces the liability of American executives for corrupt practices by their subordinates overseas , voted against it . Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware is in the hospital. // Even if Mr. Biden were to return for the override vote , his presence would increase by one the votes needed for a two-thirds majority to 67 of the 100 senators. 11 Republicans Back Bill In the face of intensive White House lobbying against the bill , 11 of the 46 Republicans supported the measure. // A key question is whether the President ' s veto message will include only the plant-closing provision and a few other items , or whether it will be a longer complaint . Costly agricultural programs , an import fee to finance worker readjustment to imports and sanctions against the Toshiba Corporation because a subsidiary sold sensitive technology to the Soviet Union are among the provisions that some Administration officials have objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long list of objections to protect them against Democratic charges that they opposed benefits for workers. // " Many of us think that there should be stronger reasons that that one issue , " Senator Dole said of the veto message. // Political maneuvering for support continued until the late-afternoon vote , which came on the fourth day of Senate debate on the bill . The Democratic leadership tried to win over Alaska ' s two Republican Senators , Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski , who favor the bill except for a provision hotly contested in their state - capping Alaskan oil exports at 70 , 000 barrels a day. // The bill would permit Alaska to export an additional 50 , 000 barrels daily to Canada , but the oil first has to be shipped aboard American vessels to a port in the lower 48 states , presumably Seattle . Only then would it be permitted to go north again . It is against current law to export any Alaskan oil. // These measures , which are also contained in a free trade agreement between the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional denials of a state ' s right to participate in foreign commerce . Senator Byrd and other Democratic Senators tried to work out possible formulas that might placate the Alaskans. // One idea was a " privileged concurrent resolution " that might strike out or soften the offending sections of the legislation . But such a measure requires unanimous consent , and other Republicans , prodded by the White House , said they would object , according to Senate aides . <> <> Retaliatory Powers Strengthened // The most comprehensive trade legislation since the Trade Act of 1974 , the bill strengthens the powers of the President to retaliate against unfair foreign trade practices . It also incorporates a number of other measures sought by business , labor , farm groups and oil producers. // Motivating several farm-state Republicans to break with the White House and vote for the bill are provisions sharply increasing agricultural export subsidies , including $2. 5 billion for " export enhancement. " // Labor gets expanded programs for workers displaced by imports , including $1 billion for retraining . It also won support for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights abroad to be used as a factor in determining American trade retaliation . <> <> ' Windfall ' Oil Tax Repeal // Oil producers get repeal of the eight-year-old " windfall profits " tax , which oilmen say discourages production. // Business reaps a number of benefits , including a softening of provisions in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act so that American corporate officials would be held liable only if they had direct knowledge that their foreign employees or agents were involved in bribery . Senator Proxmire was an architect of that law and is adamantly opposed to weakening it. // One drug concern , the Warner-Lambert Company , wins a patent extension for a new drug that could be worth more than $100 million in additional sales. // The bill would also overhaul the system under which the United States imposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate against international trade violations and other unfair practices . Authority to retaliate would be transferred from the President to the trade representative. // The President wants a trade bill to give him authority to continue negotiating trade liberalization under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tariffs and Trade , the international body that oversees world trade. // The aim of the negotiations is to open markets for banking , insurance and other services and to curb restrictive investment practices and provide greater protection for patents , copyrights and other intellectual property. // " Following a veto , Congress is unlikely to produce a stripped-down version of the trade bill this year , " predicted C. Michael Aho , director of the international trade project at the Council on Foreign Relations. //
