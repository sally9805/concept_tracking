woe unto Bob Dylan . Since he was blinded by the light and began praising the Lord in 1979 , critics have been treating him badly . He had changed his prophet 's robes once too often and had become in early middle age a caricature of the tribal elders he had once mocked in " With God on our Side . " The cynic who had referred scornfully in " It 's All Right Ma " to " flesh colored christs that glow in the dark " was now wearing a rhinestone-studded crucifix . Whither had they fled , the visions of Johanna , Dylan 's umpteenth dream ? It had been glorious for the young Dylan to preach redemption , to toss out oblique references to trainloads of fools , to wheels of fire and gates of Eden from the bag of eclectic images he had picked up in his journey across American folk culture . He had been a scrawny Walt Whitman improvising an American destiny , a rakish Rimbaud blurring the landscape into a symbolist 's reverie . He had given a mythic resonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brirriztone at his former comrades like Jonah burped up from the belly of the whale , cursing the fleshpots of Nineveh ? It was casting pearls before humanists . How does it feel to be on your own , like a complete unknown ? Unlike the Rolling Stones ? How soon they forget , unless you die young and leave a beautiful corpse . A bluesier-than-thou Robert Palmer chastised Dylan in The New York Times ( September 16 ) for sinking into a " mire of shopworn homilies , " and compared his new album , Shot of Love ( Columbia Records ) , unfavorably with Fire of Love , a record by a trigger-happy Los Angeles punk band called the Gun Club . Dylan , said Palmer , " sounds tired and somewhat confused when compared to the supercharged drive of the Gun Club , " although , condescended Palmer , " one should note that Mr. Dylan is at least 15 years older . " Perhaps Palmer felt that Dylan should have borrowed a weapon from the Gun Club and given himself a blast Carol Flake , arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book about evangelicalism. of punk . After all , punk has been a rejuvenating shot in the arm for aging rock critics who were themselves beginning to sound " tired and somewhat confused " until Johnny Rotten et al . came along with a new bandwagon to hop on . Woe unto Dylan for boarding the slow train bound for glory at a time when it was crowded with flag-waving fundamentalists rather than renegade priests . Dylan found himself in some unlikely company . That train do n't carry no gamblers , no ramblers , no midnight tokers and blessed few rockand-rollers . The soft-strumming Jesus rock that the sons and daughters of the Moral Majority have been swaying to is sickly enough to allow anyone sympathy for the devil . Besides , real rock-and-roll came after the fall and before the flood  --  it was about temptation and rebellion , not self-denial and salvation . Rock was spawned by the blues , and the blues were born of despair . If a man wanted to become a great blues singer , he sold his soul to the devil  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock-and-roll was the devil 's music , as Little Richard shrieked when he gave it up . There is a paradox involved in making righteous rock-and-roll ; it 's like pitching a revival tent on the devil 's campground . You wo n't win many souls , and you surely wo n't be preaching to the converted . In Slow Train Coming , his first born-again album , Dylan seemed to anticipate that by publicly proclaiming his faith , he would be deserted by friends and lovers , yet he still seemed concerned about keeping the multitude . That album was his most polished ever . Unlike Little Richard and Al Green , who decided that turning to the Lord meant leaving rhythm-and-blues to the devil , Dylan 's sense of calling meant a change in the message rather than a change in the medium . Like born-again football players who compete with even greater intensity after their conversions , Dylan did not consider himself hors de combat . He would put Jesus in his own vernacular , as country singers had . ( Remember Bobby Bare 's " Drop-Kick Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Foregoing the ready-made genre of gospel and avoiding the bland pieties of Jesus rock , he would recast his persona from the same folk-and-blues sources he had used in the past . Perhaps he expected his fans to take up the cross of Jesus and follow as they had taken up the cause of Hurricane Carter 's innocence during the Rolling Thunder crusade . But Dylan as disciple of Christ has made few converts , at least in the rock world ; his plain-spoken sermons are as strange to his former fans as his sing-song surrealism once was to the establishment in the 1960s . And since , as Max Weber observed , a hero 's charisma depends on his constituency , Dylan is indeed becoming a voice in the wilderness . Little did he realize when he sang " You Got ta Serve Somebody " that in choosing between God and Mammon he might have to choose between God and rock-and-roll . No wonder Dylan needed a shot of love . In Slow Train , he merged his own past with the nightmare of history and refused to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corrosive edge of self-righteousness melted into the wonder and humility of the newly redeemed and the confident jubilation of the elect . But in Shot of Love , Dylan appears to be assessing the price he has paid and salving his wounds , as though he has begun looking back in regret rather than wrath , picking through the rubble of memories for what can be salvaged . The album is a shambles  --  it has that first-take clutter and off-the-cuff delivery of his early albums , but , in general , the effect is careless rather than fresh . If the bitter pill of his conversion was lacquered smoothly in Slow Train Coming , here it is unevenly sugarcoated . The female chorus that he used in Street-Legal to echo his pronouncements becomes in Shot of Love a kind of bubbly chaser to wash down harsh medicine . In the title song , Dylan insists that the shot of love he needs is not a narcotic ? " Do n't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent . " Yet love is the anodyne ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an injection of fortitude to jolt him out of despair . Perhaps what he needs is a transfusion . A eulogy to Lenny Bruce  --  which , he admitted to radio interviewer Dave Herman , took about five minutes to write  --  is his most dolorous piece of hagiography yet . The song is so bad one wonders how Dylan could keep a straight face while intoning it . It 's the kind of thing Bruce himself would have done as a lacerating parody . As Dylan sings in " Property of Jesus , " he 's no court jester : " Because he does n't tell you jokes and fairy tales/You say he 's failed to make you smile . " In that song , Dylan 's faith becomes an identifying label setting him apart  --  one imagines a T-shirt stigmata , a rubber stamp , a tattoo . He grows defensive as he answers the critics who have " Tattooed my babies with a poisoned pen , mocked my God , humiliated my friends . " The problem with songs like this is not that Dylan has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets a million-dollar check . His songs have little resonance for the unregenerate  --  or , I suspect , for most of the " saved . " Even the devil 's disciples would find themselves clapping to good gospel music . Gospel is participatory ; it calls for a chorus of " amens . " But Dylan 's religious songs are such personal sermons that either we seem to be eavesdropping inside his private confessional or we no longer know where we stand within his litanies of sinners and fools . Dylan is so used to turning his private life into a public epic that he no longer knows where to draw the line . " In the Summertime , " for instance , is a lovely private prayer , but it offers no frissons of recognition for those who overhear it . Ironically , the most effective of Dylan 's exhortations is " Dead Man , " which burns with a fitful reggae beat and dark , almost voodoo-like , incantations : " When will you arise ; /Cobwebs in your mind , dust upon your eyes . " Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its exotic origins  --  and because the music itself , charged with a liberating spirit , is so catchy . We can dance along as ganjahigh Jamaican Rastas warn us we 're lost in Babylon . But we know Dylan too well ; we knew him before . And , as Jesus said , no man can be a prophet in his own home town . There is a song on Shot of Love , however , that takes all of us doubting Thomases and places our hands in the wounds . " Every Grain of Sand " may be the most beautiful song Dylan has ever written ; certainly he has never sung another more movingly . The wrath and the rapture are recollected in tranquillity , as Dylan becomes the pilgrim poised at the still point in the turning world : " In the fury of the moment I can see the Master 's hand/In every leaf that trembles , in every grain of sand .

This is indeed " healing " music , as Dylan told Herman .
