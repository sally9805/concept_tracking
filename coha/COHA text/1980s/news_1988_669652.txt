East German teen-agers are flocking to church pacifist meetings , Yugoslav student journalists are crusading against military leadership , and courageous young Hungarians such as Fabian are challenging the official university union. // These youngsters disdain the moderating advice of opposition elder statesmen .

' ' I would rather go to prison than serve in an army which supports the Reds. ' ' // History taught caution to the older generation . Polish workers are scarred by the brutal martial law that destroyed their independent union in 1981 ; Czechoslovaks , by the 1968 Soviet invasion ; and Hungarians , by the bloody 1956 revolution. // ' ' My parents are always telling me how we lost this war and that war , how 1956 was so bloody , ' ' says Jozsef Szajer , director of the new Hungarian student union . ' ' I tell them , ' that ' s your problem , not mine. ' ' ' // Economic stagnation offers bleak futures for East European youth . Well-paying jobs are rare .

Vaclav Maly , a dissident Czechoslovak priest . ' ' They make room for God. ' ' // After World War II , surviving Hungarian Jews struck a bargain with the authorities . In return for the right to set up Jewish institutions , synagogues , newspapers , and old-age homes , the Jewish establishment refrained from criticizing the authorities. // Younger Jews are more militant . They have created a samizdat ( underground ) magazine called Shalom , which supports Israel and questions the Hungarian role in the Holocaust. // ' ' My grandchild comes to me and says , ' Grandmom , why don ' t you criticize this ? , ' ' ' says Geza Seifert , president of the Hungarian Jewish Community .

' ' Those youngsters are naive , they are slanderous - but they break all the old taboos. ' ' // Breaking these taboos can be dangerous . Mladina ' s reporting has precipitated a steady escalation of tension between Slovenia and the federal authorities in Belgrade , which many Slovenes fear could result in an Army ' ' coup ' ' against their republic. // In Poland , Solidarity leaders fear that radical youth could push them into unwanted boycotts and strikes . ' ' Our youth is radicalizing , ' ' worries Solidarity adviser Bronislaw Geremek . ' ' Young people who think Solidarity failed may turn to violence.
