A raid on striking firemen sends tempers rising <P> Like a large , lumbering bird , the Polish army helicopter hovered for a moment over the startled crowd that had assembled outside Warsaw 's Fire Fighters Academy . A few seconds later , the chopper disgorged on the academy roof a unit of riot police that swiftly vanished into the building . As the helicopter flew off to pick up reinforcements , hundreds of helmeted militiamen entered the academy 's side gate . The 300 men holed up inside quickly surrendered and were marched out of the building by a back exit . <P> That show of strength by the authorities last week was directed against cadet firemen who had staged a peaceable eight-day sit-in at the academy . The cadets had been demanding the same academic reforms being sought by the estimated 100,000 students who had gone on strike at 80 institutions of higher education in Poland . <P> The raid was the government 's biggest show of force against strikers since Poland 's free trade-union movement Solidarity was formed 15 months ago . It was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever in handling the student rebellion and the wave of wildcat strikes that has swept the country in the past two months , could be pushed only so far . The cadets received such firm treatment because firemen in Poland are subject to military discipline and , like police forces , are under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs . <P> Still , the police were under orders not to hurt the beleaguered cadets , and there were no reports of serious injury . In fact , no one was charged with a crime . Driven in buses through Warsaw following their surrender , the unharmed fire fighters made the V-for-victory sign to passersby . Shouted one old woman : " Do n't get discouraged ! Do n't give up , whatever you do ! " Police then took the senior cadets to a student dormitory and the younger ones to two Warsaw railway stations , where they were ordered to return to their home towns . Many refused , joining other student strikers at the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute . At the same time , ten activists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detained and questioned for close to seven hours before being released . <P> The government action against the young fire fighters provoked a heated response from Solidarity locals throughout the country . The movement 's leader , Lech Walesa , immediately told his 9.5 million members to get ready for a strike alert . At an emergency meeting of Solidarity 's twelve-member presidium in the industrial town of Radom , union leaders accused the authorities of having wrecked all chances of national reconciliation . " By opting for violence , " they declared , " the government has jettisoned the possibility of a dialogue with society . "
