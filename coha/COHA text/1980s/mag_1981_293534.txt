The bionic beast is mounted on a pedestal and powered by a 5-h.p. electric motor that is operated by remote control . El Toro has graded levels of difficulty , working up from a bovine shimmy designated One to a shake-and-break Ten . The headless , vinyl-and-steel contraption was developed as a teaching aid for rodeo cowboys by New Mexico Inventor Joe Turner , who sold his patent to Saloonkeepers Mickey Gilley and Sherwood Cryer for $70-000 in 1979 ; it has since cleared at least $1 million profit for the partners , who have sold 400 of the critters . <P> Saloonkeepers who have installed El Toro claim that it can pay for itself in less than a year .

The very prospect of danger can be a potent spur . Peter Szymanski , 26 , a computer technician from Gardner , Mass. , took such a bad fall at Boston 's Celebration that he had to nurse twelve stitches under his cowboy hat . " It has n't scared me , " he shrugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to get hurt . It was only a question of where and when . " Did he plan to ride again ? " No problem . "
