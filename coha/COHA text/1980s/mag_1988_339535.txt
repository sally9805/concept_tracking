Did you hear about the New Jersey garage owner known to his friends as the " jovial giant " ? Seems he was shot to death in his driveway , allegedly by a former Scout leader who was having an affair with his wife . How about the middle-aged beautician in Florida who used to hang out at a bar called Madge 's ? Gave a ride to a drifter one night and wound up with her throat slashed and her body dumped by the railroad tracks . Then there 's the Garden Grove , Calif. , teenager convicted of shooting her stepmother to death . Now she claims she was coaxed into making a false confession by her father , who , she says , committed the crime in cahoots with her stepmother 's sister . Whooo boy . <P> TV 's police blotter is filled to capacity these days , and not just on Murder , She Wrote and Miami Vice . A fresh burst of nonfiction programming  --  news shows , pseudo news shows and other " reality " fare  --  has rediscovered those old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's Most Wanted , the highest-rated show on the Fox network , and Unsolved Mysteries , which joined NBC 's schedule this month , solicit viewer help each week in tracking down fugitives . The syndicated magazine show A Current Affair , drawing good ratings on 125 stations , goes for the gut each night with stories on crime and celebrity scandal . Typical subjects on Fox 's The Reporters , a tabloid version of 60 Minutes , range from a grandmother who tracked down the alleged killer of her daughter to racist youths known as skinheads , in a report titled " Shaved and Dangerous . " <P> You know sensationalism is back in style when Geraldo Rivera , network TV 's original advocacy reporter , is riding high . After getting dumped from ABC 's 20/20 in 1985 , Rivera started an improbable comeback by opening Al Capone 's long-sealed vault on live TV . The cupboard was bare , but ratings were huge , and Rivera followed up with melodramatic specials on such topics as drugs and death row , as well as with a daytime talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-hour special on NBC , Devil Worship : Exposing Satan 's Underground . The sometimes graphic show dwells on criminals purportedly influenced by satanic beliefs , among them a 14-year-old boy who slashed his mother 's throat and then committed suicide , and Robert Berdella , a Kansas City man under investigation for multiple tortures and murders . <P> There 's more , lots more . A string of ABC specials in coming weeks will focus on people who have committed mayhem against those they love ( Crimes of Passion ) , efforts by law enforcement officials to catch parole violators ( Trackdown ) and " infamous events that have shocked a nation " ( Scandals ) . The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper , a syndicated special airing this week , presents new clues on the Victorian bad guy , while Who Murdered J.F.K. ? claims to offer new evidence of an assassination conspiracy . In the meantime , Morton Downey Jr . shouts down guests nightly on his talk show ; a parade of lesbian mothers , sex surrogates and rape victims tell their teary stories to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works , including a Current Affair clone called Inside Edition and a new offering from Rivera dubbed The Investigators .
