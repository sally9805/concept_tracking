" It was not a homicide . . . not a suicide . It was an accident . <P> The only important thing . . . is that . Natalie is gone . All the rest is ghoulish nonsense . " Paul Ziffren , Natalie Wood 's lawyer , spoke as a grieving friend about the national fascination with her death . In a matter of hours , shock turned to pity and then to conjecture . Exactly why did Natalie Wood die ? When a gorgeous movie star full of wine stumbles off a quarter-million-dollar yacht in her nightgown and drowns , while her actor-husband sits oblivious with her film co-star a few yards away , people will talk . And wonder . <P> Wood , 43 , acted in her first movie when she was four , and though the critical praise was niggardly , she always had work . Brainstorm was her 46th movie , and her role required only three more days of filming . On a weekend hiatus , Wood , Husband Robert Wagner ( star of TV 's Hart to Hart ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sea . They relaxed aboard the Wagners ' 60-ft. yacht Splendour , moored in a cove off Santa Catalina Island , 22 miles from the Los Angeles shore . On Saturday afternoon they motored the 100 yds. to the island in a 10-ft. dinghy . They had drinks and dinner at an island restaurant , and six hours later-after four bottles of wine and two of champagne-the Wagners , Walken and the boat 's captain , all giddy , returned to the Splendour . <P> Here accounts diverge . Los Angeles County Medical Examiner Thomas Noguchi says that Walken and Wagner , 51 , had " nonviolent " but " heated discussions . " However , Los Angeles County Homicide Detective Roy Hamilton says : <P> " There was no indication that there was any argument . I think Noguchi was juicing it up a little bit . " <P> Around midnight , Wood left the two men in the boat 's main cabin and went to her stateroom . Some time later , dressed in socks , nightgown and a down jacket , she stepped out on deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear after the day 's rainstorms . She untied the rubber dinghy from the stern and then , according to Noguchi , fell from the Splendour into the 63 F water , bruising her left cheek as she tumbled overboard . <P> " It was not a homicide , " says Noguchi . " It was not a suicide . It was an accident . " His autopsy revealed that she had drunk " seven or eight " glasses of wine . There were about a dozen craft near by . Aboard one was Marilyn Wayne , a Beverly Hills commodities broker , who says she was anchored just 100 yds. from the Wagners . At about midnight , she says , " I could hear someone saying , ' Help me ! Somebody help me ! ' " She claims the cries lasted for more than 15 min. and that from somewhere in the darkness came the answer : " Take it easy . We 'll be over to get you . " Why did n't Wayne try to help ? Says she : " It was laid back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> By 1:30 a.m. , Wagner had become worried about his wife and radioed the harbor master . The call was answered instead by Don Whiting , night manager of the restaurant they had left three hours earlier . Whiting launched a search , and at 3:26 , the Coast Guard was called in . Soon after dawn , a guardsman spotted Wood 's body a mile down current from the yacht and 200 yds. from shore . The empty dinghy , loaded with lifejackets , was not far away , bobbing in the waves .
