; Election night , 1988 . In a darkened Madison Square Garden , a murmur of anticipation ripples through the standing-room-only crowd . On the floor below , the guest of honor stands , head bent , a bit overwhelmed and maybe a bit embarrassed by the spectacle . " Ladies and gentlemen , " booms a voice as the spotlight rakes the now cheering audience , " No. 23 , Miiichaaael Jooordaaan ! " As one , the 19,591 men , women and children rise to pay thunderous tribute to . . . <P> To what ? Has the Chicago Bulls ' star been traded to the host New York Knickerbockers ? Nice dream , if you 're a New Yorker ; nightmare , if a Chicagoan . Is he retiring and , like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , making his farewell appearances ? Maybe he 'll hang up the Air Jordans in a decade or two , but certainly not now . So what 's all the fuss about ? Simply that this is the first time during the 1988-89 season that the world 's most exciting basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign even appears in the stands , a semiserious calling to a higher order . <P> For now , Michael Jeffrey Jordan is high enough , thank you . As he enters his fifth year in the National Basketball Association , he is the hottest player in America 's hottest sport . Only 25 , Jordan has already won every major individual award the NBA has to offer . He was Rookie of the Year after his first season . After his third , he became the first player not named Wilt to break the 3,000-point barrier . Last season he captured an unprecedented triple crown of NBA honors : Most Valuable Player , Defensive Player of the Year and top scorer to boot . This season , averaging more than 34 points a game , Jordan could be headed for his third consecutive scoring title . He has pulled the once dreadful Chicago Bulls into the play-offs four years running and contributed mightily toward rejuvenating a deadly dull league that only seven years ago was being lampooned as the National Buffoon Association . Small wonder some sportscasters call Jordan " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more astounding given Jordan 's size . At 6 ft. 6 in. , he is a full inch shorter than the average NBA player , but he transcends his handicap by spending most of his time above the others . His perfectly proportioned frame ( his 205 lbs . include a minuscule 4% body fat vs. 7% for most well-conditioned athletes and 15% for an average male in the U.S. ) soars up , around and over the mere mortals he opposes . Most guards , being " smaller " men , prefer the quiet of the perimeter to the violent collisions of leviathans under the hoop . But Jordan is most dangerous around the basket , with his arsenal of double-clutch lay-ups and hyperspace dunks over men very nearly a foot taller . Through it all , Jordan 's tongue dangles from his mouth , his universally recognized trademark and a testament to his intense concentration . <P> For Jordan , the world of basketball is a world without bounds . He gyrates , levitates and often dominates . Certainly he fascinates . In arenas around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their seats for fear of missing a spectacular Jordan move to tell their grandchildren about . Bulls assistant coach Phil Jackson admits that the Jordan Freeze affects seasoned veterans . " Even I get caught up in Michael 's show , " he says . " I try not to , but sometimes I just sit back and enjoy . "
