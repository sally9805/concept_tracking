Fed up with interlopers crowding their swimming pools and picnic tables , residents of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn voted last November to close the city 's parks to outsiders . " Racism ! " cried the local office of the A.C.L.U. and the Detroit chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. , which promptly filed a suit against the town and kept the ordinance from being enforced . Dearborn ( pop . 86,960 ) has fewer than 100 black residents , the N.A.A.C.P. argued , so only blacks would routinely be asked to show their city identification cards . " When they said ' residents only , ' they were really talking whites only , " said the Rev. Charles Adams of the Detroit N.A.A.C.P. <P> Last week the ban on nonresidents was struck down altogether when Wayne County Judge Marvin Stempien ruled that a random check of park users ' identification violated constitutional guarantees against illegal search and seizure . Pending a possible appeal , Dearborn 's parks will remain open to outsiders , and the N.A.A.C.P. has called off its ten-month-old boycott of local stores .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
