For months the Presidents of five Central American countries had been signaling new hopes for peace in their embattled region . The focus for that optimism was a proposal they planned to discuss at a June 25 regional summit meeting in Guatemala City . But last week , following a flutter of U.S. diplomacy in the region , the peace initiative appeared to collapse . Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte , Washington 's closest ally in Central America , demanded a postponement of the meeting . Meanwhile , President Reagan held a hastily arranged , one-hour session at the White House with the author of the peace plan , Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez . After the meeting , the White House noted that Reagan had " concerns " about details of the proposal , while Arias stated that there had been agreement " on the end . . . but not the means . " <P> Even before the White House statement , charges had been flying throughout Central America that the U.S. was once again working to stymie the convoluted regional peace process . Nicaraguan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the attacks of U.S.-supported contra rebels , accused the U.S. of a " direct attempt to kill any possibility of a negotiated settlement in the region . " Ortega once again charged the U.S. with foiling peaceful negotiations in order to " isolate Nicaragua and launch a direct invasion against our country . " The Nicaraguan President declared that he would not agree to a summit postponement and would boycott any future meeting . <P> U.S. officials , on the other hand , argued that the problem with the June 25 meeting was a lack of advance preparation that could be solved with only a few weeks ' delay . But that claim rang hollow . Conceded one U.S. diplomat : " We panic at the thought of a Central American agreement with the Sandinistas . " <P> Arias describes his ten-point proposal as a " risk for peace . " As he sees it , the plan is a " balanced proposal " that , at best , could bring an end to nearly a decade of bloodshed in the region . At worst it would call the Sandinistas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they frequently insist they are not ( see box ) . <P> First aired in February , the Arias proposal echoes many of the items included in the so-called Contadora process , a four-year , Latin American effort to negotiate a Central American settlement that still sputters on without appreciable result . Both plans call for a region-wide cease-fire and an end to outside military assistance to all guerrilla groups , including the rebels in El Salvador and the contras . Both schemes propose a general amnesty for insurgents , followed by a peaceful political dialogue between opposition forces and incumbent governments . The Arias plan also follows Contadora in calling for pluralistic democracy in all Central American countries . But the Arias scheme is more specific : it would require all five nations to begin holding free elections within six months of agreeing to the accord . <P> A more important innovation in the Arias scheme is that it calls for a cease-fire to precede the intended reconciliation in each Central American country . As far as Nicaragua is concerned , that amounts to recognition of a long-standing Sandinista refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
