Charlie Brooks walked into the execution chamber , stretched out on the hospital gurney , and a catheter needle was inserted into a vein in each of his arms . Into the left ( on which Brooks had a tattoo reading I WAS BORN TO DIE ) would come the drugs ; the right catheter was a standby . Extending from each needle was a length of clear plastic tubing that ran through a plywood slat to the executioner 's room next door , and there into a standard hospital bag of saline solution . <P> For about half an hour , only the solution , consisting of sterile salt water used routinely as a medium for drug injections , flowed into Brooks . At about 12:10 a.m. , the executioner injected the first of three syringes into the left tube . The dose : two grams of the barbiturate sodium thiopental , about five times the amount given as an anesthetic before surgery . <P> Brooks died from an overdose of the sodium thiopental , an autopsy revealed , just as prison authorities had intended . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second dose was 100 mg of pancuronium bromide , a synthetic muscle relaxant designed to paralyze Brooks and stop his breathing . The last was enough potassium chloride to stop the heart . When , at 12:16 , Brooks was pronounced dead , two-thirds of the potassium chloride remained unused .
