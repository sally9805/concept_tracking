SCIENCE FRICTION , acidly quipped one Paris newspaper . Across the English Channel in London , Britain 's New Scientist magazine howled , NATURE SENDS IN THE GHOST BUSTERS TO SOLVE RIDDLE OF THE ANTIBODIES . After a month of heated controversy and speculation , the curtain fell last week , at least for now , on one of the strangest tales of scientific controversy in recent memory . The story became public on June 30 , when the prestigious British science journal Nature published a report , hedged with " editorial reservation , " on a phenomenon that defied the laws of physics and molecular biology : water apparently retained a " memory " of some molecules it once contained in solution . When such water was mixed with blood cells , that phantom memory seemingly caused a reaction . <P> Even Nature 's editors had a hard time swallowing the results of the research , which was directed by Jacques Benveniste , a laboratory head at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research . The initial findings were apparently reproduced by scientists in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report was accompanied by an editorial by Editor John Maddox that was almost apologetic . " There are good and particular reasons , " he wrote , " why prudent people should , for the time being , suspend judgment . " Last week Nature forthrightly rejected the idea of water with a memory and relegated it to the deep freeze , along with other intriguing scientific " discoveries " that have not panned out under scrutiny . <P> Its demise was the work of a highly unusual investigative team that the magazine dispatched to Paris . Besides Maddox , the Nature group included James ( " the Amazing " ) Randi , the scourge of clairvoyants , faith healers and spoon benders , and Walter Stewart , a free-lance fraud sleuth at the U.S. National Institutes of Health . Their report was merciless : " The hypothesis that water can be imprinted with a memory of past solutes is as unnecessary as it is fanciful . " The behavior of the weird water was only a delusion , they concluded , based on flawed experimentation . But the matter did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism that it lent credence to the whole messy business by publishing the report in the first place . <P> The affair strained credulity from the outset , like the proverbial little man who was n't there . Benveniste 's researchers had diluted a solution of antibodies to such a degree that there was no likelihood that even a single molecule of the antibody remained . But , voila , when human white blood cells were exposed to the superdiluted solution , they apparently responded by releasing a chemical substance , as they would have if they had encountered the initial antibody solution . The effect only worked when the solution was shaken violently . Explained Benveniste : " It 's like agitating a car key in the river , going miles downstream , extracting a few drops of water , and then starting one 's car with the water . " Benveniste was comfortable with his findings but openly admitted that he could not explain the strange goings-on . <P> Nature 's editors were duly skeptical . The magazine had printed , with disclaimers , some dubious reports in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper that claimed Psychic Uri Geller , since discredited by Randi , could predict dice throws a million times as accurately as chance would predict .
