When Suburban Parisians Jean-Francois and Catherine Mayaux ordered a Minitel plugged into their telephone line 18 months ago , they planned to use the toaster-size computer console as an electronic telephone directory . But they soon found the Minitel terminal equally convenient for paying bills , purchasing airline tickets and making theater reservations . Lately they have started shopping a la modem , issuing on-line orders for everything from foie gras to fine wines . " Each wine has a numeric code , " explains Mayaux , as if buying a Burgundy electronically were the most natural thing in the world . " We punch it into the Minitel , and ten days later the wine arrives . " The Mayauxs are not alone . Today some 4.5 million French men and women are shopping , banking , reading and , yes , flirting via Minitel , the state-run experiment in computer-to-computer communications that has grown into the world 's largest home videotext network . Begun with a flourish in 1981 when the French Postes Telephones Telecommunications seeded a village in Brittany with 1,500 free terminals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minitel 's success has been so astounding that the French government is attempting to export the system to the U.S. " To find oneself at a Minitel screen able to converse freely with four or five people is new  --  there is no equivalent , " says Francois de Valence , editor of the glossy Minitel magazine . " It 's like an electronic cafe . " <P> Minitel is not all digitized gossip . Farmers use it to track weather reports and commodity prices . Pharmacists order drugs , investors check stock portfolios , and real estate agents post listings . Collectors sell antique furniture , rare coins and secondhand fur coats . Jacques Toubon , leader of Premier Jacques Chirac 's Rassemblement pour la Republique party , invited voters last August to pose questions to him via Minitel and drew thousands of responses . <P> But the most popular services by far are the messageries , or message centers , where anonymous , person-to-person conversations can get very personal indeed . Someone tuning in to one of the system 's dozens of dating directories earlier this month could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman calling herself Sensitive : <P> She : I like to see the wind blowing through a man 's hair . <P> He : Describe yourself . Do you live in Paris ? <P> She : I 'm tall and blond with freckles and live in Paris . <P> He : Give me your phone number . <P> She : Not yet  --  describe yourself . <P> He : Dark and tall . What do you want from me ? <P> She : Sensitivity and strength . <P> He : I have both  --  meet me at the fountain in the Jardin des Tuileries at 4 p.m. today . <P> At one franc a minute ( roughly $9 an hour ) , electronic chats like these add up . In the first six months of 1986 , Minitel users made 122 million calls , logged 13 million hours and poured $53.7 million into the hands of some 3,000 services , including newspapers , travel agencies and retail shops . One information purveyor , the daily tabloid Le Parisien Libere , fields 50,000 calls a day for its mix of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , half of which is profit .
