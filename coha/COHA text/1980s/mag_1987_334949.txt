It is not the best of times for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone . Even his vaunted friendship with Ronald Reagan could not prevent the imposition last week of stiff U.S. tariffs against $300 million worth of Japanese exports . The move was in retaliation against Tokyo for selling microchips below cost on world markets and refusing to buy more U.S. semiconductors . At home , where the battle cry " Uriage-zei funsai ! " ( Smash the sales tax ! ) has been raised since February , Nakasone 's proposed tax reforms , which include a new 5% sales tax , have won him few friends . Last week the Prime Minister 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered its worst setback in 30 years in local elections . Concluded Tokyo Political Commentator Masayoshi Ito : " The Nakasone administration is in its last days . " <P> Leery of the backlash against Nakasone 's tax proposal , provincial L.D.P. politicians had gone so far as to ask the Prime Minister to stay away from the campaign hustings . Indeed , Nakasone has done little to help his dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past four months . Last week he rammed his new budget , overdue by two months , through a parliamentary committee . In a three-minute session marred by shoving and shouting , L.D.P. Budget Chairman Shigetani Sunada declared the measure passed and adjourned the committee . The national daily Asahi Shimbun called the incident a " rash act that shamelessly tramples down the popular will expressed by the local elections . " Nakasone called the tactic " unavoidable . " <P> The Prime Minister 's supporters argue that the tax-reform bill , along with its unpopular sales levy , must be passed to stimulate domestic economic growth . The plan would reduce income taxes to encourage consumer spending , creating a greater demand for imports . The sales tax , they contend , would make up for revenue lost with the cuts . An increase in U.S. exports to Japan would then take the heat out of the trade war and help stabilize the soaring yen , which has made Japanese goods more expensive abroad . Still , despite an L.D.P. majority in parliament , both the tax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of sanctions suggested , Washington is skeptical about whether Tokyo has the will to correct its $58.6 billion trade imbalance with the U.S. Last week U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker tried to allay Japanese concern about the yen by calling a further decline of the dollar " counterproductive . " Nonetheless Baker complained that Tokyo 's proposed economic reforms " are not yet government policy " and warned that " Japan still must do more . " <P> The Reagan Administration 's new 100% tariffs were levied on some Japanese color TVs , personal computers and power tools . Although the sanctions will affect only a tiny fraction of overall bilateral trade , they will hurt some Japanese manufacturers . But for the middlemen peddling Japanese microchips to foreign buyers , business will probably go on as usual . Already some American enterprises dependent upon inexpensive Japanese chips are busy looking for legal loopholes to exempt them from the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement signed last year . In the meantime , tensions show no sign of abating . When Yasu calls on his friend Ron at the end of the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
