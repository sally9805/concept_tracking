Who would place a $90 million , high-powered radar station so close to an airport that it has to be shut down every time a plane lands ? Someone , it turns out , who should know better : the U.S. Air Force Space Command . The problem exists at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia , where a giant early- warning radar searches for missiles launched from submarines . But the apparatus is only 1.5 miles from the approach end of a runway , and Air Force electronic engineers fear that its emissions could trigger electromagnetic explosive devices on many military aircraft . Those devices are used mainly to discharge fuel tanks or fire air-to-air weapons . To guard against accidental explosions , the radar is manually shut down for up to 90 seconds whenever a plane approaches the field . <P> While the Air Force insists that electronic flight-control circuits inside its aircraft are shielded against radar and radio emissions , it closed the radar station completely during a precision-flying exhibition in November by its Thunderbirds aerobatic team . Several Army BlackHawk helicopters have crashed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost control of their choppers . The Air Force has now compiled a list of 300 powerful radio transmitters in the U.S. that its pilots must avoid by a certain distance . The list is secret .
