SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS by John Updike ; Knopf ; 257 pages ; $18.95 <P> BY PAUL GRAY <P> For more than 30 years , John Updike has borne , with considerable poise and good humor , a terrible burden . He is one of those people whose prayers were answered . Growing up a beloved only child in Shillington , a small town in southeastern Pennsylvania , he dreamed of becoming a writer , of seeing his work appear on the pages of The New Yorker . And  --  presto !  --  these things occurred and were then followed by unanticipated consequences : lots of money , critical recognition and fame . Worse fates have befallen people , and Updike adjusted as best he could : he cashed the checks , entertained intrusive interviewers and basked modestly in the limelight . But several years ago , his equanimity slipped when he heard that someone , somewhere , was planning to write his biography . " To take my life , " he thought , " my lode of ore and heap of memories , from me ! " If anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided , it ought to be Updike . <P> Self-Consciousness is neither a straightforward autobiography nor a decisive pre-emptive strike against future chronicles . There will surely be biographies of Updike someday , all of which , if they are any good , will draw heavily from this book of revelations . Updike 's candor is not of the scandalous or titillating sort . Rather , the six essays assembled here piece together a fascinating self-portrait of an evolving sensibility , of a mind learning to love the world from which it feels , for several reasons , estranged . <P> The love came early , prompted by the sensations and surroundings of childhood . Visiting Shillington , Updike unexpectedly finds himself at loose ends for a couple of hours and wanders about through a soft spring drizzle , trying to recapture his past . He enters familiar ground : " The street , the house where I had lived , seemed blunt , modest in scale , simple ; this deceptive simplicity composed their precious , mystical secret , the conviction of whose existence I had parlayed into a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His first attempts to put this secret into words were , he gently suggests , sometimes misunderstood : " My own style seemed to me a groping and elemental attempt to approximate the complexity of envisioned phenomena and it surprised me to have it called luxuriant and self-indulgent ; self-indulgent , surely , is exactly what it was n't  --  other-indulgent , rather . " <P> The blights on his happy childhood seem small , but , Updike argues , they inexorably determined the life he would lead . As a boy , he developed psoriasis and a sporadic stammer ; he could savor reality 's entrancing parade but never feel comfortable joining it himself . The recurring rashes on his skin kept him apart , drove his attention inward : " You are forced to the mirror , again and again ; psoriasis compels narcissism , if we can suppose a Narcissus who did not like what he saw . " One of the hallmarks of his fiction became elaborate celebrations of the status quo . Updike thinks he knows why : " An overvaluation of the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was not , as I felt myself to be , a monster . "
