Benazir Bhutto , 33 , was back at her Karachi home last week after 25 days in prison . In an interview with TIME , the charismatic leader of the opposition to Pakistan President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq sounded more bitter and less certain than when she was firing up huge crowds with calls for national elections . But she was still defiant , blaming the government for the fact that 40 people have been killed in recent disturbances . " This regime is prepared to shoot at people quite mercilessly , " she said . Nonetheless , Bhutto appeared shaken by her imprisonment , and by the failure of the millions who cheered her return from exile last spring to protest her arrest . She indirectly conceded that this raised doubts about her ability to change the Zia regime 's course and that the government could arrest her anytime it wished . " How long I 'm free I do n't know , " she said . " That depends on their whim . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
