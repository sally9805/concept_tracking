The polls and the pols refer to the nuclear freeze and unemployment , but the dual specters really haunting the upcoming elections are international nuclear holocaust and domestic depression . Given their obvious importance , it may be superfluous for us to urge our readers to evaluate this fall 's candidates in terms of their positions on these inescapable subjects . But we would like to draw attention to two significant races , on opposite sides of the country , which might otherwise escape notice . We are fortunate to have in Betty Goetz La11 , the Democratic/Liberal candidate for the House in this magazine 's own Congressional district , one of the nation 's leading students of and workers for nuclear disarmament . We enthusiastically back her attempt to unseat the Republican incumbent , S. William Green , who characteristically has split the difference on the disarmament issue , belatedly coming out for a freeze on " strategic " nuclear weapons ( excluding the Pershing 2 ) after voting more funds for the neutron bomb , the cruise missile and the MX missile . Across the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil liberties in California , but there is another underreported story in that state : the message Elizabeth Martinez , a former Books and the Arts editor of The Nation , is carrying to the voters as the gubernatorial candidate of the Peace and Freedom Party . Martinez has identified as " Public Enemy Number 1 " the transnational corporations whose drive for superprofits propels the arms race and destroys the global economy . Her thesis  --  that the militarism of the Reagan Administration and the cutbacks in social services are a direct result of its role as servant of these ungoverned conglomerates  --  is not original , and Elizabeth Martinez will not be the next governor of California ; but the logic of her argument will be with us long after next Tuesday 's election is forgotten . The Screw Ti tens The demonstrations in Poland on August 31 ? in which , underground sources report , more than 600,000 people participated , largely the educated and skilled who are the backbone of both Solidarity and the economy  --  signaled that the Polish populace was not going to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally claimed that the street actions were small and sporadic and the work of foreign subversives , but in fact the government took them seriously : within weeks it arrested several members of KOR , the main dissident group in Poland , and made Solidarity permanently illegal . Four Solidarity intellectuals have been charged with attempting to overthrow the government and most likely willreceive lengthy prison terms . The four are Jacek Kuron , a leading militant in KOR see his " ' We Must Move to Resistance , ' " The Nation , May 8 ; Adam Michnik , a historian and longtime activist ; Henryk Wujec , an elected official of the Warsaw branch of the union ; and Jan Litynski , former editor of Robotnik ( Worker ) , a principal publication of the democratic opposition during the late 1970s . In addition , Jan Jozef Lipski , a literary critic , was arrested at the Warsaw airport after returning from London . The arrests of these five , no doubt to be followed by others , do not indicate that the government is planning to bring charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard - line radicals . The Jaruzelski position seems to be that the union militants can be dealt with best by isolating them and keeping them out of any future union , but the intellectuals have to be taken on directly because they played such a crucial part in organizing support for Solidarity  --  and because the regime needs scapegoats who are not prominent public figures . Such a strategy , of course , is standard Eastern European stuff : the poor worker led into rebellion by antisocialist dissidents who are actually agents of the West . We can be sure the new union that the government intends to establish will allow no such riffraff . The debate going on right now in the underground cells of Solidarity is over how to respond to the government 's proposed union . Zbigniew Bujak , head of Solidarity in Warsaw and acting national coordinator since martial law was declared last year , has always taken a " legitimization " line and today argues that Solidarity members should join the new union and win control of it from the inside . The counterargument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the regime 's hands and undermine the ideals of Solidarity . The ' violence we have seen in Poland in these past few weeks is likely to be repeated as the economy limps on and several political anniversaries fall due through the winter . It is difficult to imagine what Jaruzelski thinks he is doing with this long and increasingly vicious period of repression , since it only seems to be laying the groundwork for future upheavals on a scale far greater . By continuing to ignore the simple and legitimate aspirations of the Polish citizenry , he is bringing the day closer when he will be forced to call on the military support of the Soviet Union , an eventuality even he can not desire . An Uneasy Peace 0 n August 31 , Honduran Army Col. LeMidas Torres Arias went public with some startling accusations . From exile in Mexico the former head of military intelligence in Honduras charged the commander of the Honduran Army , Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez , with " leading Honduras into an abyss of internal destruction , " and " embarking on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alvarez has plans , said Torres Arias , " for the physical extermination of all opposition " within Honduras and for " carrying out an international military adventure of incalculable consequences for the nation . " Torre ; Arias 's dramatic charges were recently given some support in Washington . According to a senior U.S. official , in late July Honduran intelligence got wind of a Nicaraguan plan to attack border camps in Honduras that the Nicaraguans allege are home to anti-Sandinist rebels . In order to forestall the attack , Alvarez began moves to involve Honduran troops in strikes against Nicaragua . Only frantic telephone calls from top U.S. officials convinced Alvarez to back down . Craig Johnstone , the director of the State Department 's Office of Central American and Panamanian Affairs , has refused to confirm this account for the record . " In my judgment , it is highly unlikely that that would actually ever occur , " he said . According to the August 22 Baltimore Sun , however , " a State Department official familiar with the area said two weeks ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Nicaraguan border , including giving ground support to former Somoza supporters who wanted to perform hit-and-run operations in Nicaragua . The official , who asked not to be named , said the State Department warned the Hondurans not to take ' rash actions ' that could lead to war . " General Alvarez has been a key U.S. ally in the policy of " drawing the line against communism " in Central America . Under his direction , the Honduran Army has turned a blind eye to the Somocistas ' use of Honduras as a base of operations , and according to reliable reports from international relief workers in the border zone , Honduran officers are actively supporting the exile groups . The close call in July , however , demonstrated that Alvarez may have become too trigger-happy for Washington . One senior Honduran officer went so far as to claim that the United States was behind Torres Arias 's accusations . But Torres Arias insists that he was motivated only by a concern for his country . Last March it was widely reported that President Reagan had approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua . One part of that plan , it was said , involves the training and support of paramilitary forces in Honduras for military operations against the Sandinist government . U.S. officials have refused to confirm or deny the destabilization plan , but it is acknowledged that there are anti-Sandinist refugees along the border . Honduran officers refuse to comment on the use of their territory by Somocista groups . " 1 do n't know if these bands exist , " said a senior officer recently . " But it is very difficult to control the border , which is mountainous and wooded and very rugged . " According to a State Department official , " the ability of the government of Honduras to exercise control of the frontier is very limited . " The hands-off attitude of the Honduran Army appears to stem from fears of a revolutionary nation on its borders . Officers cite  --  as does the Reagan Administration ? Nicaragua 's arms buildup , its support of terrorism in El Salvador and Honduras and its acceptance of Cuban advisers as threats to their country 's stability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful coexistence with the Sandinists is impossible . " We can not come to an understanding , " said a senior military aide , " with the kind of Marxist-Leninist government they are trying to create . We must be patient and look for an internal solution in Nicaragua , so that there is no need for a war . But if political , diplomatic and economic efforts fail , that is , if Nicaragua does not respond to ' massage , ' we would be prepared to cross the frontier . " Rhetoric aside , the Honduran Army as a whole has done little to show that it is raring for a war with Nicaragua . A confidant of Alvarez 's has said : " There is not the desire that existed before to go to war " But by allowing Somocistas to use Honduran territory , the army may be playing with fire . The exiles claim to be " preparing something big these days " and are making macho statements about returning to Managua by December . And Sandinist leader Daniel Ortega Saavedra , according to Business Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honduran border " to take out the Somocistas with surgical precision . " A war may be building no matter what the Honduran officers want . So far the fear that whoever strikes first will lose the war-because world opinion would be almost certain to force international action of some sort against the aggressor-has helped to maintain an uneasy peace . But the margin for error , miscalculation and impatience is huge . " The real danger , " said one Honduran coffee farmer , " is that war would break out without anyone knowing how it really got started . " That would mean a prolonged conflict that might eventually involve a number of Central American nations , " and that would spell disaster for the region . " CYNTHIA ARNSON Cynthia Arnson , a regular contributor to The Nation 's " Central America Watch , " recently returned from a trip to Honduras and Nicaragua . ' War , the Blood-Swollen God ' The indefatigable Ruth Leger Sivard , who has put out a series on World Military and Social Expenditures over the last eight years , has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she presents the startling figures reproduced in the chart below . The story they tell should sober the most bellicose hawk . Since 1960 , just counting hostilities in which more than 1,000 people died , there have been no fewer than sixty-five wars accounting for the deaths , at a conservative estimate , of more than 10.7 million people . These wars have been fought on the territory of forty-nine countries , **25;2641;TOOLONG two-thirds of the world 's population and two-fifths of its land area . These statistics , interestingly enough , were compiled not by the governments that produced this slaughter but largely by private organizations and scholars such as William Eckhardt of the Peace Research Laboratory in St. Louis . They are incomplete , Sivard notes , particularly with regard to civilian deaths , since governments often make no effort to calculate those figures . Ten million humans : could any mere political ends justify the obliteration of those lives ? Everybody , presumably , has their favorite and lasting impression of the President . As he ap- proaches the middle of his term , some prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of the Hinckley . Others speak fondly of his relaxed schedule , his unpunishing routine . Still others treasure his many endearing blunders and falsehoods at press conferences . On every hand , you can hear praise for the way in which he rises above the wreckage of his policies , apparently unscathed . Say what you like , runs the common opinion , but he 's a regular fellow and he 's doing his best . The Republican TV spots in this campaign , which feature various wizened citizens asking us for gosh sakes to give him a chance , are nicely judged to exploit this generous impulse in the breast of the American public . From my Washington garret , I have observed all this and wish to state as follows . Two things happened in the last month that have made me unable to think about the President in this indulgent fashion anymore . The first was his miniconfrontation with Gary Allen , the second his " aside " about the American peace movement . Gary Allen is a Birchite whacko running for office in California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when , at a gathering of loyal candidates , he presumed to criticize the Reagan record thus far , he was told to put a sock in it . This performance  --  and the toadying response of the press ( " ' SHUT UP , ' QUIPS REAGAN " ) ? has curdled my feeling of reverence for Ronnie . That was the best he could do with an unscripted question at a gathering of like-minded colleagues . What a reflection . A day or two later , he grinningly accused the freeze campaigners of being Soviet agents or Soviet dupes . It was done in his usual likable fashion  --  the broad brushstroke , the friendly tones , the impromptu value judgment . Except that in this case , the broad brush left a venomous smear . You can see it sometimes at press conferences when he does n't like ( or does n't grasp ) a question . The ever-ready grin begins to congeal , and the eyes narrow in a nasty way . There is a thuggish streak in the President , a streak we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shows already in his choice of friends and ministers . People talk as if Reagan were somehow not responsible for his government . Political analysts , pollsters and other wiseacres speak of him as if he had some cloak of invulnerability that protected him from his own policies and his own colleagues . Who do they think originated those policies ? Who do they imagine gave jobs to Watt , Donovan , Block , Clark , Gorsuch and all the other nuts and dolts ? If America is rearming into bankruptcy , if the air and water i are being befouled , if other countries are cringing from the American embrace , it is the President who is responsible . Reagan 's the one . Consider , for a moment , his light touch on the international scene . He has offended the Israelis without pleasing the already highly offended Arabs . He has infuriated Taiwan without conciliating China . He has cheated and angered Western Europe without helping Eastern Europe . He has poisoned relations with Central America . He has even outraged the Canadians . And all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit side ( warmer relations with Marcos , Suharto and Botha ) , you get the same point in a different way . At home , the President takes the view that all the bad news is an act of God or of Jimmy Carter , and all the good news is his own responsibility . In practice , he does not like to leave things to such random chance . By letting Gorsuch lift pollution regulations in California , and by offering massive bribes to the grain farmers who feed the Soviet Union , he demonstrates a deft sense of the short-term opportunist maneuver . His claim to have personally sponsored the bull fever on Wall Street is really an admission that his original monetary policy has failed . Supply-side never even got started . Never mind . The Great Communicator will rise above this too . Or take the Constitution . Reagan looks upon it as a document of almost infinite elasticity . Together with his appalling friends , he has made several attempts to cut it and shape it as may suit his immediate purpose . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inconceivable , a ludicrous and superstitious amendment promising a balanced budget is not . Nor is it any thanks to the President that various measures designed to annul the spirit of the Constitution have been defeated . On prayer in school , for instance , those who would tie the hands of the Supreme Court in the future had their hands freed by Reagan in the present . What might he not do if given a free hand himself in the legislature ? Reagan came to power talking out of both sides of his mouth . He promises less government and more liberty whenever he has an audience of people who fancy themselves as entrepreneurs , people who feel that money can be made only if laws are bent or regulations made " flexible . " And he threatens less liberty and more government to all those who desire personal freedom or sexual tolerance . This is not the paradox that many liberals suppose it to be . It 's perfectly natural , indeed automatic , for people like the President to demand freedom for speculation , strict control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military establishment . What the " paradox " ignores in any case is the large category of Americans for whom the President does n't care at all  --  the accumulating underclass who are made neither slave nor free by his policies , but are simply neglected and forgotten . But the time will obviously come when the patient and decent electorate begins to weary of the President 's alternate unctuousness and bullying . His evasions and innuendoes can only postpone the realization . It was a mistake to elect this glorified Babbitt in the first place . After two years the verdict is in . Ronald Reagan is doing to the country what he can no longer do to his wife . " You must get over this , " my wife said . " It 's misplaced sympathy . " I could n't get over it . The minute I saw Forbes magazine 's list of the four hundred richest people in the United States , my heart went out to the person who was four hundred and first . " He 's nothing but some rich creep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . The phrase she had used suddenly conjured up a picture of the poor soul I was worrying about : Rich Creep , the Manhattan megadeal cutter and man about town . He lives in the Carlyle . He dates models . He eats breakfast at the Regency , where deals are made so quickly that a careless conglomerateur could find himself swallowing up a middle-sized corporation while under the impression that he was just mopping up his egg yolk with the end of a croissant . He dines every night at places like La Caravelle and Le Cirque . " Bon soir , Monsieur Cripp , " the headwaiter says when Creep walks in with an icily beautiful fashion model who weighs eighty-eight pounds , twelve of which are in cheekbones . " If I may make a suggestion , the overpriced veal is excellent tonight . " On the way to breakfast one morning , Creep happens to see the cover of Forbes at the Carlyle newsstand . " The Richest People in America , " the headline says . " The Forbes Four Hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing right in the lobby , he starts going through the list  --  at first methodically and then desperately . Finally , he turns and slinks back to his room . He ca n't face the crowd at the Regency . They 'd pretend nothing has changed , but then they 'd start trying to find some smaller corporation for him to swallow up  --  the way a nanny might sort through the picnic basket to find the smallest piece of white meat for the least adventurous child . He cancels his dinner date for that evening . He 's afraid he might be given a cramped table near the kitchen , where the draft from the swinging doors could blow the fashion model into the dessert cart . He 's afraid that the same French waiters who once hovered over him attentively while he ate ( " Is your squab done expensively enough , Monsieur Cripp ? " ) will glance in his direction and whisper to each other " les petites pommes de terre " ? small potatoes . " People are beginning to talk about how often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . That may be true . When everyone else was looking among the impoverished for what Reagan meant by " truly needy , " I called attention to the plight of Philip Caldwell , the chairman of the Ford Motor Company , who was denied an incentive bonus two years in a row even though I have every reason to believe that he was going flat out the whole time . When the Reagan nominee for chairman of the synfuels corporation , a lawyer from Greenwich , Connecticut , said that the proposed salary of $150,000 was so far below a living wage that he might be forced to move out of Greenwich , I tried to bring to the world 's attention what a sadspectacle it would be if everyone who made less than $150,000 a year had to leave Greenwich , moving west in a caravan of station wagons like a preppy Grapes of Wrath . " I suppose you 're going to say , ' The rich are different from you and me , ' " my wife said . s She was referring , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures  --  when Zane Grey said to Will Rogers , " The rich are different from you and me " and Rogers replied , " Yes , they do n't wear cowboy boots . " Was it when rich people began wearing cowboy boots that I included them in my concerns ? No , it was long befOre that . It was when Fortune first published its list of the five hundred largest corporations in America . My . heart went out immediately to the corporation that was five hundred and first . Of course , I had no way of knowing its name  --  that tragic anonymity was the basis for my sympathy  --  but I always thought of it as Humboldt Bolt &; Tube . I felt for the folks at Humboldt Bolt &; Tube . I could see them giving their all to build their corporation into one of the largest corporations in America  --  busting unions , cutting corners on safety specifications , bribing foreign heads of state , slithering out of expensive pollution-control regulations  --  only to remain unrecognized year after year . As the Fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured the scene at the Humboldt Country Club in Humboldt , Ohio , when an important visitor from Wall Street asks casually over drinks , " Do you have any Fortune 500 companies in Humboldt ? " For a moment , no one speaks . The " old man , " as everyone in Humboldt calls Harrison H. Humboldt , the son of Bolt &; Tube 's founder , looks out at the eighteenth green , the hint of a tear in his eye . Finally , someone says , " No , but we 've got the third largest granite pit east of the Mississippi . " " You simply ca n't take this on while you still insist on worrying about that silly bolt company , " my wife said . It 's true that my feelings about the folks at Humboldt remain intense  --  particularly just after the Fortune 500 list comes out each year . I can see old Harrison H. Humboldt sitting in his office , looking disconsolate . Just missed again . Has it all been worth it ? His son is a cipher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose fathers used to call him H.H. are a bunch of Bolshevik hippies . His grandson answered the most recent inquiry about what he intended to make of his life by saying , " I 'm into cocaine , Gramps , and the rock zither . " A trusted aide says , " Cheer up , H.H. You 're one of the richest men in the country . " But is he ? I grabbed Forbes from the coffee table , and raced through the list . Harrison H. Humboldt 's name was not there . Parvenu oilmen were there . New York real estate sharks were there . Coca-Cola bottlers were there . But not Harrison H. Humboldt . Just missed again . " You have to forget about this creep , " my wife said . " You 're right , " I said . " I do n't think Creep even deserves to be listed . Compared to a man like Harrison H. Humboldt , he 's , small potatoes . "                 @ @ @ @
