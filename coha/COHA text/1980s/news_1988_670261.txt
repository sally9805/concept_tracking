ALLIANCE , Neb.  --  " Great God , we thank you " intones the Rev. Donald Nunnally , as members of his flock at the United Methodist Church here bow their heads in prayerful gratitude . After years of being hammered by wind , hail , drought , bugs , heat , frost and just about every other plague that nature can visit on a farmer , somebody is finally smiling on Nebraska ' s Panhandle . Elsewhere , the nation ' s worst drought in a half-century may be searing crops and withering dreams , but farmers here on the High Plains and in a handful of other spots around the nation where rain is plentiful are rediscovering the truism that clouds can have silver linings . Alliance , for example , has received about two more inches of rain than it usually gets by this time of year . The rain , along with the plentiful Ogallala aquifer that is pumped for irrigation in this part of Nebraska , has left the fields of alfalfa , corn and hard red winter wheat in good shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this summer , they will be able to cash in on commodity prices that have been driven through the roof by the drought elsewhere . Wheat , for example , is currently selling here at $3. 32 a bushel compared with $2 at this time last year . Corn should fetch nearly twice last year ' s $1. 50 a bushel . " Things are looking better here than in a lot of the other wheat states , " says Michael Glesinger , who helps compile the crop report for KCOW , the local radio station . Adds wheat and bean farmer James Irwin : " I guess one man ' s downfall is another man ' s gain . " No one here , of course , is reveling in the misfortune of others . ( Mr. Nunnally even adds a postscript to his Sunday sermon , asking for divine help for those who have been hit by the drought . ) But there is a sense of relief that the worst of the weather seems to have picked somewhere else for a change . " People are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Garwood , owner of Alliance Tractor &; Implement Co . A steady procession of smiling farmers in seed caps file through Mr. Garwood ' s front door these days and cluster around the hulking machines parked on the lot outside . Mr. Garwood predicts that for Panhandle farmers  --  and consequently for him as well  --  this could be the best year in a decade . Alliance ' s good fortune comes from a long finger of moisture stretching up from west Texas and Oklahoma that seems to just tickle the southwest corner of the High Plains . Another band of rainfall has soaked farmers along a narrow coastal stretch in the East between New Jersey and Florida . Rain has also fallen on the Pacific Northwest coast and inland on western Washington ' s Palouse wheat country . In a reminder of nature ' s fickleness , the eye of this year ' s drought rests just a couple of hundred miles north of here , along the Red River Valley between Minnesota and North Dakota . In normal years , rainfall in this part of the Panhandle averages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago farmers here were getting emergency shipments of hay from the eastern part of Nebraska because of drought . Local growers routinely leave chunks of land idle to store moisture for the coming year . " This year , we ' re the lucky ones , " says Patrick Deaver , who operates a farm and several grain elevators here . " People are thinking , dreaming , hoping the market stays strong . " Farmers with plenty of rain aren ' t the only winners the drought has produced around the country . Business is booming for irrigation companies and well drillers . Commodities consultants are reaping bushels of bucks . Some 600 farmers showed up recently at a motel in York , Neb. , to listen as consultants hired by the Nebraska Corngrowers Association explained how to make the best of the rollercoaster grain market . " Volatility breeds fear , " says Douglas Hjort , a Des Moines , Iowa , agricultural consultant who says farmers have been paying up to $1 , 200 each to sign up for his service . " These people know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . They need to talk to someone . " Low river levels and record sales of government grain are making railroads happy , too . " We think that grain will be moving quickly into the marketplace , " says Roger P. Sperry , a specialist in commodity transportation for the Burlington Northern Railroad , the nation ' s largest grain hauler . Already grain elevators here in Nebraska and elsewhere around the Midwest are reporting shipments of grain from farmers who have paid off their government loans and reclaimed grain held as collateral . With grain prices up , farmers who have ample grain both in their fields and in storage stand to reap fat profits . Bud Pieper , a Hay Springs , Neb. , farmer , has 70 , 000 bushels of collateralized corn held by the government at prices as low as $1. 90 a bushel . " We ' re planning to buy it back most any day now , " says Mr. Pieper , who expects to get $3 a bushel or more on the resale of the corn . " That ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Farmers in areas hit hard by the drought are also buying back collateralized grain . But with this year ' s crop yields likely to be skimpy in those regions , most will have to hoard the grain to make sure they can feed livestock and miss out on the generous price spread . Texas has both winners and losers this year . " Its kind of a good news-bad news year , " says Rodney Mosier , executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers Association . In several areas where rain has been ample , Texas wheat farmers have more than doubled the state ' s 29-bushel-per-acre average . " If you have the wheat then prices are terrific , " says Mr. Mosier . But those farmers that aren ' t getting the yields because of the drought lose out twice , he says , because the high prices are cutting down on government support payments . In Dumas , Texas , farmer Kenneth D. Keisling late last week sat waiting for the rain to let up so that he could get on with harvesting his 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grain prices will climb still higher as the drought worsens elsewhere around the nation . A sure sign , he says , is that North Dakota wheat farmers have already begun their harvest . " The only way they would do that this early is if their wheat is completely dried up , " Mr. Keisling says . Perhaps nowhere is the contrast between wet and dry as sharply etched on the land as it is along the Atlantic Coast . In South Carolina success or failure this year sometimes depends on which side of the county you farm . " We ' ve got farmers who are doing fine on one side and farmers who are hurting on the other , " says C.C. Adams , agricultural extension agent for Dillon County , S.C. In Williamburg County , not far from the South Carolina coast , a hefty early wheat crop and good rain have prompted some farmers to take a chance planting soybeans for their second crop this year instead of vegetables like cucumbers .

" Some of our people are going to do real well , " Mr. Scott predicts . In the county ' s wheat contest this year Mr. Scott says some farmers turned out 80 bushels an acre . " You hear farmers talk sometimes at the country store about those kinds of yields , but you don ' t often see them when it comes to weighing and measuring time , " Mr. Scott says . " This year though , we sure did . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
