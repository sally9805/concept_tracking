Bill Stokes is a Tribune writer . The spirit of spring sags now as the great green tide moves across the Midwest and builds to surflike dimensions in northern Wisconsin . A cloud filters the sun . A chill sweeps the land . And the laughing cry of the loon slides across the cold lakes with an anthropomorphic message . A fish has come to the spring prom . A walleye with an open dance card is shaking up the party and the music has turned discordant and ugly . Once the fish with the white reflector eyes was common fare for the Indians , who took it with spears during its spawning run , when it was easiest to get . Like gardeners utilizing a crop , the Indians speared and ate the fish . They sat in the lap of Mother Nature like the rest of her babies and they worshiped the harmony that surrounded them . Then came the white man , in great clamoring hordes and with foreign schemes for domination . He shoved everything aside-trees , rivers , hills , swamps and Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land areas in return for a pittance , and in one of the " trades " it was agreed that they would retain the right to take walleye in some places . Who could see that as anything but an absurd trinket in the white man ' s besting of the naive natives ? Over the decades , even centuries , the displaced Indian culture could neither assimilate nor die . It was like an animal injured by traffic that struggles to right itself in the ditch but only manages to squirm and writhe in a kind of endless agony . The invading white man claimed fishing as one of his sports , and to protect himself from his own greed he installed rules and constraints . Multimillion-dollar business structures emerged to service the white fun fishermen , and Mother Nature was forced into an impossible shotgun marriage with Mr. Economics . Then one day the wounded " animal " got up out of the ditch and said , " I think I will go walleye spearing . " Screams of outrage issued forth from the white community . People began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retaining the lion ' s share of the Wisconsin " fish-fry . " They called Indians names and threw things at them and , led by the governor of the state , they asked a judge to stop the Indians ' " intolerable " behavior before somebody got hurt . The judge declined to do so , suggesting that the behavior of the protesters was the problem and not the Indians ' walleye spearing , which was done in accordance with lawfully granted treaty rights . The spearing was stopped by the Indians after they had taken some 15 , 725 walleye , and had made the political point that something of value was still theirs . Before it ended , 217 protesters were arrested . So the ghosts of past misjudgments and atrocities roost like vultures in the pine trees of northern Wisconsin . A modern " conservation " ethic clashes with a treaty right . An incredibly complex problem is beyond the simplistic solution that seems obvious to some . The circumstance provides opportunity for exercising the more unpleasant aspects of the human character and racism flits among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring in the north woods.
