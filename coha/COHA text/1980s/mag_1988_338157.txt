In Beirut the ordeal of the three French hostages ended as abruptly as it had begun . Last Wednesday evening a Mercedes roared up to the Summerland Hotel , carrying Diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine and Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann , who had been held captive since 1985 . Syrian security forces hustled the men to Beirut International Airport , and by the next morning they arrived in Paris for a joyous reunion with their families . <P> Almost simultaneously with the release in the Middle East , the quiet of a South Pacific dawn in Ouvea , New Caledonia , was broken by the dull thud of smoke bombs and the crackle of small-arms fire . Some 300 elite French troops and gendarmes had launched an operation to rescue 23 Frenchmen from a cave where they had been held by Melanesian separatists . In the 7 1/2-hour gun battle that ensued , two gendarmes and 19 militants died . <P> Acting at locations thousands of miles apart , the government of Premier Jacques Chirac had suddenly decided to free its citizens . Though Paris maintained that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but give a badly needed boost to Candidate Chirac 's presidential campaign against Incumbent Francois Mitterrand . <P> For the Lebanese hostages , liberation was the end of a nightmare that began with their capture by the terror group Islamic Jihad . " We did n't live , " said Kauffmann in Paris . " We survived . " The captives were kept in chains for months at a time and were repeatedly moved , sometimes in sealed coffins . But their American counterparts came in for worse treatment . Kauffmann was reported to have said last week that when he was briefly imprisoned with American Educator Frank Reed , his fellow captive was so badly beaten , perhaps after an escape attempt , that he was unable to rise from the floor . <P> How much had France paid for its citizens ' freedom , both to Iran , which brokered the release , and to Islamic Jihad ? Interior Minister Charles Pasqua insisted that " not a franc , not a dollar , not a deutsche mark " was rendered . But another French official said the Iranians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken last summer . They also wanted repayment of a $1 billion loan made to France in 1974 , which they argue has appreciated considerably because of accrued interest . France has so far paid back $660 million . <P> Outside France , feelings were less euphoric . There are now 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon , including nine Americans and three Britons . The French deal raised fears that freeing those still held would be more difficult and that the release might even encourage more kidnapings . Pounding her hand in the House of Commons , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared , " We will not pay ransom ! " In Washington , State Department Spokesman Charles Redman expressed the same view . <P> The French assault on the New Caledonian rebels provoked almost as much controversy . But Overseas Territories Minister Bernard Pons insisted that he took action only because " we believed that at any moment there would be a massacre " of the hostages . Leaders of New Caledonia 's secessionists accused . the French of staging the assault to gain votes . Declared the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood and fire that will increase our resolve .
