The shuttle is " right on the money " and gives the U.S. a mighty lift <P> Suddenly shouts rose from the hot , sunbaked desert floor in Southern California . There it was , high over the distant buttes , a tiny , gleaming dot in the pale blue sky , an apparition from space returning to earth . <P> Inside the cockpit , the 50-year-old commander , with glasses specially fitted into his helmet to correct the farsightedness of middle age , took over the controls for the final critical maneuvers . Expertly , the veteran pilot guided his craft through a long , easy turn . When he completed the maneuver , the ship was lined up perfectly with a runway marked in the ancient , arid bed of Rogers Dry Lake six miles away . " Right on the money , right on the money ! " encouraged Mission Control . <P> Then John Young edged the " stick " forward , and his ship 's porpoise-shaped nose dropped slightly . Plunging earthward , Columbia was falling at an angle about seven times steeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as fast . Powerful as it had been on takeoff , the ship was now functioning as a 102-ton glider with no engine to correct its course . <P> At 1,800 ft. and 35 sec. from landing , Young pulled back the stick to check his dive . Only Columbia 's stubby wings and slightly flared underbelly were giving it lift . But , to his delight , he found the craft far more aerodynamically buoyant than expected . Nineteen seconds before landing , he dropped his wheels . <P> " Gear down , " reported a chase jet , buzzing alongside and counting off the altitude : " 50 feet . . . 40 . . . 5-4-3-2-1-Touchdown ! " As its rear wheels made contact , the flight director in far-off Houston told his tense crew : " Prepare for exhilaration . " Nine seconds later , the nose wheels were down too . Columbia settled softly onto the lake bed . Young had floated the shuttle along 3,000 ft. beyond the planned landing spot , able to use its surprising lift to make a notably smooth touchdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert air , The Star-Spangled Banner rattled forth from hundreds of portable radios tuned to a local station . From Mission Control in Houston 's Johnson Space Center came an exuberant " Welcome home , Columbia . Beautiful . Beautiful . " <P> So it was : simple and flawless , almost as if it had been performed countless times before . Yet the picture-perfect landing on California 's Mojave Desert last week all but obscured the historic nature of those last , breathtaking moments of Columbia 's 54-hr. odyssey . Gone were the great parachutes and swinging capsules of earlier space missions , splashing into the sea , never to travel into space again . For the first time , a man-made machine had returned from the heavens like an ordinary airplane-in fact , far more smoothly than many a commercial jet . So long delayed so widely criticized , Columbia 's flight should finally put to rest any doubts that there will one day be regular commuter runs into the cosmos .                  @ @ @
