The Presidency <P> President Carter now has the body and face of a far younger man . His running has boiled off even the traces of fat , made his stomach almost concave . His muscles and bones have adjusted to the new physical challenge . The corners show . His face seems square from his jaw to his haircut , which has exposed his ears more and flattened the top . More angles . The stringiness so apparent when he first began jogging has disappeared . He is coiled physical vitality behind the desk in the Oval Office or sitting in an overstuffed chair in the family quarters . <P> Carter is a rather small man . <P> He weighs 151 Ibs. , stands 5 ft. 9 in . Plain , muted suits and ties enhance his slenderness . Yet when he talks these days he seems bigger . His principal concern is world peace . His thoughts must embrace the entire globe . For three years he used to rush back from every excursion into Big Power and drop out with town meetings and backyard picnics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the march , and either he plays the central role or no one does . Soviet intentions must be redefined , free-world interests stated , and American power positioned to provide political unity and hold territory . It is not the sort of thing most Presidents like to do . It is dangerous work . Harry Truman , it is said , would just as soon have ducked U.S. involvement in the Greek-Turkish crisis of 1947 . He concluded he could not , and the Truman Doctrine was born . It was perhaps his finest hour . <P> The question : Is this new Carter big enough inside to understand the enormousness of the challenge the U.S. faces and reach beyond anything he has imagined before to establish a principle for free-world survival ? <P> There are some good signs . Carter reads the hot-line messages from Leonid Brezhnev with knitted brows . Question marks . He handles the few pages as if they were radioactive . They could be . He says each critical word as if destiny were buried in its syllables . That could be too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to talk Government reorganization and revenue sharing . His mind probes beyond the merely visible . If the Soviet moves in Afghanistan are unopposed , that confirms to the men in the Politburo that they can invade the soft spots of the free world with impunity . If that attitude survives these months , then cataclysm lies ahead . Carter must move on instinct , something he has avoided for three years . <P> He reads the old documents , like the account of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 . He worries on the phone with France 's President Giscard d'Estaing , and he probes cautiously on a call to India 's newly elected and infuriating Indira Gandhi . The President 's international phoning is now done with the same casualness he uses for Iowa 's caucus votes . His list includes Pakistan 's Zia , Germany 's Schmidt , Egypt 's Sadat , Britain 's Thatcher . He still writes Brezhnev regular personal letters . <P> Carter 's mind has never had to embrace so much . One second it is on China and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf , from there to the Islamic conference in Pakistan and back to U.S. military capability . The breadth and difficulty of these unsolved equations of power are Churchillian.
