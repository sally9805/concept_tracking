Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was in Washington last week to discuss his country 's military and economic needs with President Reagan and top Administration officials . During the visit , Rabin won promises of $1.8 billion in U.S. military assistance but failed to change the Administration 's stance that Jerusalem must first implement domestic austerity programs before increased economic aid can be considered . Later in New York he met with a group of editors and journalists , and next day talked with Time Inc . Editor in Chief Henry Grunwald , Chief of Correspondents Richard L. Duncan and Senior Writer William E. Smith . Excerpts from the two interviews : <P> On Israel 's decision to withdraw unilaterally from southern Lebanon : Our new government decided to focus on one issue : reasonable security for our ( northern ) settlement population , and to ( achieve this ) without remaining in Lebanon . I believe that among the many surprises , and most of them not for the good , that came out of the war in Lebanon , the most dangerous is that the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted that ; I could n't find it in any Israeli intelligence report . The Shi'ites , the largest community in Lebanon , were oppressed by the P.L.O . ( Palestine Liberation Organization ) . They did n't like the struggle against the P.L.O. , and they received us in the beginning as liberators . But in the last year and a half , they looked at us the way they looked at the P.L.O. , as a foreign occupation force . It 's more than that . In trying to forge an identity , they had to have somebody to fight , and so they started a struggle against Israel . If as a result of the war in Lebanon , we replace P.L.O . terrorism in southern Lebanon with Shi'ite terrorism , we have done the worst ( thing ) in our struggle against terrorism . <P> In 20 years of P.L.O . terrorism , no one P.L.O . terrorist ( ever ) made himself a live bomb  --  took a car or pickup , put half a ton of high explosives in it and drove it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shi'ites did it to the ( U.S. ) Marines in Beirut , to the French paratroopers and to us in Tyre . In my opinion , the Shi'ites have the potential for a kind of terrorism that we have not yet experienced . <P> On how the withdrawal will be carried out : We decided to redeploy unilaterally in three phases to the international boundary , and maintain a security zone that will be manned by local Lebanese forces friendly to us , rather than be a daily target for every Shi'ite group , as we are now . I prefer offensive methods . We 'll see what the Shi'ites do . If there is a problem , we 'll bomb them , we 'll shell them . If there is a need , we 'll send an armored column in to cope with the area from which they have come . In any event , Lebanon will remain a center of terror . Terror can not be finished by one war . It 's total nonsense ; it was illusion . I told the people ( of northern Israel ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockets ) will fall on you , any more than I can promise anyone in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem that no plastic bomb will be blown up in a bus or a supermarket . In fighting terror , you can not let it interfere with the normal life of civilians in Israel .
