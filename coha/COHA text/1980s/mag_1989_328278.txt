After weeks of rumblings , federal drug czar William Bennett last week unveiled an $80 million emergency plan for an assault on the drug-and-murder epidemic in Washington . But the proposal looked more like an outline for a skirmish than for an all-out offensive . <P> Bennett snubbed Washington 's embattled local government by failing to invite any of its representatives to the press conference at which the plan was announced . He went on to castigate the administration of Mayor Marion Barry , saying it " has failed to serve its citizens . " Finally , he disclosed a set of measures that may put more dealers behind bars but is likely to do little to curb rampant drug use . Local police will get help from 82 federal agents . A 500-bed detention facility will be built in the District and more beds will be available in a federal prison in Maryland . Drug treatment will gain only 300 beds instead of the 1,040 the city asked for . Will Bennett 's battle plan do much to help the nation 's capital kick the habit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding Barry , whose friendship with an accused drug dealer is under investigation , that is far from certain .
