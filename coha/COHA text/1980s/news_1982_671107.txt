The Democratic Party supports the national movement to control nuclear weapons and prevent their use , including the national nuclear weapons freeze campaign , as a clear expression of the strong desire of the American people to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race . We believe that the United States should pursue , on an urgent basis , serious strategic arms control negotiations consistent with the maintenance of overall parity with the Soviet Union , including , to the fullest extent possible : // - A mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing , production , and deployment of nuclear warheads , missiles and other delivery systems ; // - Major , mutual , balanced and verifiable reductions of nuclear forces to lower equivalent levels , with special attention to destabilizing weapons that are vulnerable to or capable of preemptive attack ; // - Strict adherence by both sides to all arms control agreements negotiated to date ; // - Measures to prevent the use of nuclear weapons by each superpower , such as expanding political and technical mechanisms to reduce the risk of war by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joint United States/Soviet stations to enhance the command and control of nuclear weapons systems ; // - Systematic multilateral efforts , both political and technical , to restrain the reckless commerce in sensitive nuclear materials and technology and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and explosive capabilities to third parties , including terrorists ; // - Conclusion of a verifiable Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ; // - Serious negotiated efforts to increase stability and lessen the risk of war in Europe by reducing the conventional and nuclear force imbalance in Europe and by initiatives such as mutual confidencebuilding measures to provide greater warning time ; // - Expansion of the participation of all nuclear weapons states in arms control negotiations .

Today , women who can find work earn , on the average , only 59 cents for every dollar earned by men . The earnings gap extends to all education levels . Women with four years of college have lower incomes than men with eighth-grade educations . Indeed , fully employed women who are high school graduates earn less on the average than fully employed men who have not completed elementary school. // The Democratic Party is committed to the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) joint worker management pay equity studies to identify and correct internal pay inequities between predominantly female and predominantly male jobs ; ( 2 ) collective bargaining to upgrade undervalued job classifications , regardless of whether they are typically considered male or female jobs ; and ( 3 ) new job classification studies by any Democratic Administration , as well as supporting all other appropriate action , we will ensure that women in both public and private sectors are not only paid equally for work which is identical to that performed by men , but are also paid equally for work which is of comparable value to that performed by men. // The Federal Reserve Board , with the full support and encouragement of the Reagan Administration , has pursued a high-interest-rate , tight-money policy , which has driven our economy into recession , produced unemployment and an unprecedented wave of bankruptcies among farmers and businesses and created a virtual depression in the housing and construction industries. // Among the policies that should be considered in Democratic efforts to lower interest rates and restore some sanity to national monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , appointing labor and consumer representatives to the Federal Reserve Board , returning to a monetary policy based on stabilizing interest rates and targeting available credit to encourage productive investment and discourage sterile mergers and speculation . <> <> New Tax Policy // Democrats will seek to enact a new tax policy . We must restructure the tax laws to make them fairer , simpler and more efficient . We should have a tax code in which all citizens with equal incomes are treated essentially the same way . We should have a tax code that is simple enough for all citizens to have at least a basic understanding of how the system works and how their own tax obligations are determined . We should have a tax code which lets people make investments to make money , not to lose money for tax reasons. // The best way to accomplish this is to adopt a broad-based , low-rate tax system . To achieve simplicity while preserving equity , that system should have a liberal standard deduction , a uniform rate for most taxpayers , and an additional progressive rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low rate tax generates the revenues needed to finance legitimate public purposes we should eliminate most tax credits , exclusions and deductions. // To guarantee fairness for taxpayers at the low end of the income scale , part of the rate reduction should come from increasing the personal exemptions and the zero bracket amount. // Stop the massive revenue drain opened in the 1981 tax bill by scaling back the tax cuts , capping the cuts at $700 per taxpayer ( $700 is the tax cut for a family with $40 , 000 annual income ) and eliminating the worst of the special interest loopholes , such as the " leasing " of tax credits . These steps would provide funds for the job creation programs and would sharply reduce the mammoth deficits now projected . Capping the tax cut at $700 for the 1982 and 1983 fiscal years would give the Federal Government an additional $25 billion ; closing the worst of the tax loopholes could easily supply another $25 billion per year. // The Democratic Party must be the party to call for overhaul of the existing Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes investment in the nation ' s productive capital base . Therefore , our party will lead the national debate over the four major reform alternatives : the progressive expenditure tax , the simplified progressive tax , the value-added tax , and flat-rate tax. // Our present income tax system has grown increasingly inequitable with the steady proliferation of special deductions , exemptions and credits . Common sense dictates that this convoluted system be dramatically simplified . One alternative deserving further study is the gross income tax. // A G.I.T. would be a tax on gross income and would eliminate all current deductions , exemptions , adjustments and credits . Although the gross income tax has generally been conceived as a flat-rate tax , we should also consider a progressive rate structure . Tax rates under this system would be much lower than present marginal rates , because they would be applied to all of a taxpayer ' s income . A G.I.T. could be applied to both personal and corporate income . <> <> Public Works Jobs // Adopt a vigorous and comprehensive jobs program to rebuild , renovate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass transit and other infrastruture facilities . Such a program , creating socially useful jobs for 500 , 000 people , would cost approximately $7. 5 billion . <> <> Balanced Budget // The Democratic Party recognizes that uncontrolled spending and massive deficits are not compatible with a strong national economy . The Administration has embraced a budget which will add a quarter of a trillion dollars to the national debt in just three years , driving up interest rates and unemployment. // We believe the Democratic Party can offer a sound alternative to massive Republican deficits . We support a budget process that employs honest numbers and which no longer relies on the continued and repeated use of the deficit . Rather , we favor a combination of budgetary savings and the raising of sufficient revenues through a just and equitable tax system to pay for the national priorities established through an open debate in the Congress. // Investing in Our People // We are at the dawn of a technological revolution sweeping across our own and our competitors ' economies .

In urban areas , much of the crime encountered was likely to be shoplifting or juvenile vandalism. // The Reagan Administration ' s response to our national crime epidemic has been a mixture of good news and bad news . The good news is that they say they are going to be even tougher on crime fighting agencies. // The Adminstration ' s reaction to the recommencations of the Attorney General ' s hand-picked Task Force on Violent Crime is a case in point .
