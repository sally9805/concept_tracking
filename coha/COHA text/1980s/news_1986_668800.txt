Martina Navratilova received a tough test and a lesson Friday night . Both came from 16-year-old Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina , who hit several passing shots and service returns that Navratilova called " great , fantastic , spectacular , " adjectives regularly used to describe Martina ' s game . But with Sean Connery , the screen ' s original James Bond , watching , Navratilova pulled an escape worthy of Secret Agent 007 himself . The top-seeded world champion regained her lost concentration in time to win a second-set tiebreaker ( 7-2 ) for a 6-2 , 7-6 quarterfinal victory over Sabatini in the Virginia Slims tournament at the Pavilion . " Things have been going too easy for me , " said Navratilova . " This teaches me a lesson not to let up one centimeter . " That could be bad news for No. 8 seed Zina Garrison of Houston , Martina ' s foe in Saturday night ' s semifinal . But the speedy Garrison , who will celebrate her 23d birthday Sunday , goes into the match on a roll . Garrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight winning points and won 29 out of 30 as she demoralized and defeated Bulgaria ' s 17-year old Katerina Maleeva in another quarterfinal . The third player to make the semifinals was Hana Mandlikova , the No. 2 seed and No. 4 ranked player in the world . She outlasted big-hitting 6-foot 2- inch Claudia Kohde-Kilsch of Germany 6-4 , 7-5 . When she wasn ' t hitting the carpet rolling for shots , Hana resembled a groundskeeper , constantly picking objects from the court . " Just little fluffs of dirt , " said Hana . " My room is a mess , but on the court , I like it clean . Hitting the floor is just me . If I ' m playing my best tennis , both my knees are bleeding . " Pam Shriver , the No. 4 seed , completed the semifinal field by knocking off No. 7 seed Kathy Rinaldi 6-3 , 6-4 to move into a Saturday match against Mandlikova . Before playing Navratilova , Sabatini promised , " I ' ll pass her . " And the dark-haired Buenos Aires schoolgirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navratilova seven times at the net for winners . She also drilled nine winners on returns of serves . Her returns of Martina ' s second serves enabled her to break Navratilova ' s service for the first and only time in the tournament . This tied the second set 4-4 and eventually forced the match into a tiebreaker . " That was my plan  --  to pass her  --  and it worked very well , " said Sabatini . " On the returns , I just concentrated and moved my feet . I ' m very happy at the way I played . " Navratilova wasn ' t happy , blaming her loss of serve on a failure to concentrate . " She went for broke , and she made it , " said Martina . " But I hit three first serves in a row all into the net . That ' s lack of concentration . " Against Garrison , Navratilova said she must concentrate on playing her own game , not trying to " play above myself and hit harder and place the ball too perfectly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s speed and wide variety of shots led to her 23 straight winning points in a surge from deuce in the final game of the first set to a 5-0 lead in games and a 15-0 advantage in the sixth game of the second set . During this streak , Garrison sprinted the depth and width of the court to chase down apparent winners by Maleeva and turn them into her own winners . She hit every shot in the book  --  winning serves , serve-and-volley combos , drop shots , drop-and-lob combos , passing shots , a deft lob , backhands , forehands , overheads , half-volleys and acrobatic stretching gets at the net . With each point in the streak , Garrison ' s confidence soared and Maleeva ' s shoulders sagged . " I felt really hyper , " Garrison said . " Like I couldn ' t miss . I hit two unbelievable shots when I raced along the net and she was back at the baseline . After that , I felt I could hit anything . I hit some lines , so I kept hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 40-30 in the first set , Garrison was looking at set point against her and blooping a powder-puff second serve that barely cleared the net . The next moment , she was on fire . " I didn ' t mean to hit that second serve that soft on set point , " she said . " I was lucky to get away with it . Sometimes when you see a really soft shot , it throws off your timing . " Maleeva mis-hit the lollipop second serve and knocked it out to put the game at deuce . Garrison held , making it 5-5 . In the next game , Maleeva missed an easy putaway at the net for a 6-5 lead . That signaled the start of Zina ' s 29-for-30 roll . CAPTION : PHOTO : ( color ) Tribune photo by Ed Wagner Jr .
