txt 3 ? APPRENTICESHIP WE TACKLED our second vegetable garden with the confidence of true sophomores . Preparing the land was considerably easier because most of the small brush and roots had rotted beneath the winter snow , and the previous summer of cultivation meant that there was little remaining sod . Once again we hired other farmers to do the plowing and harrowing . We now had at least some idea of the order in which work was done . As with any new undertaking , one of the first hurdles to overcome was the acquisition of a working vocabulary . The previous season had provided us with names of tasks , tools , machinery , and plant varieties , and with ways of talking about the weather that are peculiar only to farmers . If memory serves me well , the Allens had a chestnut gelding that year . They expected us to borrow their horse again , and they were prepared to advise us through another season . They ordered // extra flats of tomato , pepper , cabbage , and broccoli plants for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of companies that we had become acquainted with over the winter . We added a number of vegetables to our garden , including melons , onions , cauliflowers , summer squashes , radishes , and beans for drying . We did not , however , cut down very much on the amounts of our first-year plantings , so by July we began harvesting prodigious amounts of vegetables . We bought a freezer and began to freeze and can even more of our crops than we had the year before . There was still a surplus of food . One weekend late in June , a neighbor called to tell us that she heard on the radio about a farmers ' market that was being organized in Lewiston , only twenty miles from our farm . She thought we might be interested . Quite on impulse , I called the Cooperative Extension Service that was heading up the effort , and I was told that the first market was open to anyone who had his or her own produce to sell . The markets would begin in two weeks , on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Lewiston 's Franco-American snowshoe clubs . Mark and I decided to go . About eight vehicles showed up for that first market . We were quite a collection . In addition to Mark and me , there were fulltime truck farmers , retired mill workers who were farming parttime , weekend gardeners , and a couple of craftspeople , since the first market was billed as a combination farmers ' and crafters ' market . The vehicles were as varied as the sellers , ranging from station wagons carrying a few baskets of vegetables to threequarter-ton pickups with hundreds of pounds of produce . Since there was no prearranged market plan , we stationed our vehicles on a first-come , first-serve basis . After everyone had arrived , we were randomly positioned in a gravel parking lot , fenced in by a tall chain-link fence and overshadowed by a huge billboard . The early morning sun cast some thankful relief on that rather dingy spot . Mark and I were two of the first to arrive , because we had so 42 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our truck . We had picked most of the vegetables the evening before and outfitted our truck with an assortment of wooden apple crates and pieces of plywood , from which we made a display table . We arranged our goods on the table and marked each item with a quickly lettered price card . You could sense a certain amount of tension on that first market day : each farmer was eyeing the others , wondering what the others had brought , what they would charge , and if there would be enough customers to make the trip worthwhile . Most of the other sellers had a history of selling from their trucks , much as Olive had done . Some had sold produce to local supermarkets and restaurants when they could . This was the first attempt in our area to bring farmers together to cooperate while they were simultaneously competing against one another . Customers began arriving even before we were able to finish setting up . In a matter of one and a half hours , Mark and I had sold all of our extra garden produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money to the effort it had taken to acquire it had no influence on our reactions ; the pleasure came entirely from the experience of producing something tangible and then selling it directly to the consumer . Other farmers also sold all of their produce , and there was an air of excitement and optimism that seemed to be shared by sellers and buyers alike . After packing our truck with empty baskets , boxes , and boards , we headed back to the farm , making plans for the next Saturday market . That same afternoon Mark and I walked up and down the rows of our garden , trying to evaluate the plantings so that we could see what might be ready for harvest by the end of the week , for the second market . And so it went for the next seven weeks . Our weekly sales grew from $18.75 to an all-time high of $61.34 during the middle of August , when all the crops were producing heavily . At the final day of the market in September , we took in $49.38. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cucumbers , summer squashes , and cabbage than we could sell at the farmers ' market , so we brought our produce to a small grocery store where we often bought supplies . The buyer agreed to take our vegetables . Then , at the end of the season , we exchanged twelve bushels of potatoes for sixty dollars ' worth of milk from a neighbor 's dairy . According to my records , our last sale was made on November 1 , when we earned $11.31 for some parsnips and turnips . When we added everything together , we discovered that we had taken in $498.4 3 from our second garden . Our entry into the vegetable-selling business was just this casual and simple . Moreover , we counted every penny of income as real profit , and in the most naive sense , I suppose , it was . Those vegetables would have been given away or discarded if we had not sold them . The naive belief that anything that can be sold is profit would continue to play an ever-increasing role in our notions about farming for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the expenses of farming , in that summer of 1973 , we never complicated the questions of pricing , profits , and losses . We were not at that time a family that needed to sustain itself on an agricultural income . I am able to report our first sales figures to the exact penny because I began taking notes on our selling activities at the outset . I go back now to the first set of records we ever had , notes gathered in an old spiral-bound college notebook left over from one class or another . I continued to use the same notebook for the next four years , until all of its pages were filled , some with statistical data and others with random narrative information . This record keeping , started out of mild curiosity , has been the underpinning of all the business growth and whatever successes we have had . As the years progressed , the notes became more deliberate and more detailed . The weeks of selling were numbered , the crop prices were included , and the field space devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather , the harvest dates for the crops , the peak seasons for production and sales . I 44 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE included a sentence or two about how the weather or holidays affected the crowds at the markets . I gathered some of the information just for its sentimental value , and it has been enjoyable and amusing to reread dates for and comments on setting out the grape arbor , trenching and planting one hundred asparagus roots , and transplanting two young maples to the newly planted lawn on the west side of the farmhouse . After only a couple of years of keeping a journal , I could begin to see some progress in the sales of our crops , and I realized that data collection was becoming increasingly important . But our rather compulsive record keeping was often the subject of ridicule and criticism at the farmers ' market . Other sellers seemed overly aware of our note taking , and we were asked by many members why we bothered to record each and every sale . We were told that it was ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy and we were trying to wait on people . Numerous older farmers at the markets said that they knew how much they planted and approximately how much they made . The challenge for them lay principally in having the earliest crops of the favorite fruits and vegetables ? they were competing to have the first corn , tomatoes , cucumbers , beans , and apples . Beyond that , there was very little sophistication in the marketing strategies of most of our peers in those early days . Despite the criticism we received , I knew instinctively that we needed real information to remind us of our summer 's activities , information that we could interpret in planning for the years ahead . There was an additional reason for my tenacity in record keeping . Mark and I were new and part-time growers , with no plans to give up our city lives . Our farming was limited to weekends and summer vacations , and even at the outset , I was interested in seeing how a finite amount of time and space given to gardening could be managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the winter months ? time we now refer to as farming on the kitchen table ? Mark and I would study our notes , evaluate the same one-acre plot of cultivated land , // count out its rows , estimate the hours of time we would have to work the land , and try to come up with a plan that would give us the greatest returns . We were asking not only for more income but for the opportunity to learn about new vegetable varieties . It became important to be able to compare the relationship of space , costs , and time , because we were having to mete out our energies carefully , divided as we were between urban and rural activities . Although most of the other sellers at the market may not have shared our belief in record keeping , there were a few who recognized the sincerity of our interest in market gardening . As it turned out , they were the most successful growers among the membership , and they became our teachers , along with the Allens As the market grew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location , and so Clarence Bradbury became our constant Saturday neighbor . Clarence , who had retired to Maine from Connecticut , where he had operated a junkyard , was one of the first members of the Lewiston farmers ' market . He farmed about twenty acres of land and specialized in growing tomatoes . Regardless of the season , he always had the first ripe fruit for sale , and over the years many of us tried to challenge his lead . None of us ever succeeded . Raising early tomatoes was only one of Clarence 's skills , however . He paid a great deal of attention to marketing . Regardless of the weather or the time of year , Clarence was the first seller to arrive at the market , so that he would have plenty of time to arrange his produce in an attractive display before the early morning shoppers came . Some of the other producers ( almost always the less successful ones ) would drive their trucks into place once the market was under way , and they never got properly set up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stormy Saturday , or they would not bother to come for the earliest and latest marketing dates , when their gardens were not producing heavily . But Clarence always came , and always arrived first . 46 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Not only was the Bradbury display the most attractive ; the Bradbury display had the best salesman . Clarence loved to sell , or so it appeared . He worked very hard with each potential customer . If he could catch the attention of a passerby , he would engage him or her in conversation about the weather , the quality of his food , his farm , why he chose to raise the particular varieties that he did . He would give customers information about using the food . Inevitably , during the conversation he would bag up a pound of this or that . He never sat on the tailgate of his truck waiting for someone to ask him a question . His manner was friendly and persuasive . Even when he did n't have a customer in front of his stand , he kept busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few farmers I have known who put as much effort into selling his wares as into growing them . Fortunately , Clarence took it upon himself to instruct Mark and me . Frequently he would walk over to our truck and ask us how we were doing . He showed us how to keep a product selling by constantly moving it into smaller and smaller boxes , so that the last of the food still looked plentiful as it mounded up over the top of its container . " You can never sell the last of anything if it is sitting in the bottom of a big box , " he warned us repeatedly . He gave us advice on vegetable varieties , pointing out that some were more reliable than others in our climate . He suggested some varieties that had more eye appeal than others . He critiqued our display , reminding us to set up alternating colors and shapes of produce ? a criticism that embarrassed me , a designer from Boston , working on a national magazine : I had forgotten to apply some basic design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial following at the earliest farmers ' markets . He was the first member of the group to advertise that he farmed organically . He was , in fact , one of the earliest members of the organic farmers ' movement in Maine . Lest you picture him as a hirsute , barefooted young back-to-the - lander , let me inform you that Bud was a chain-smoking , cleanshaven , baseball-cap-wearing fifty-year-old who , like Clarence , // retired to Maine from Connecticut . He was also an informed horticulturalist and , like Clarence , generous with advice for newcomers Bud was perhaps the most intellectually curious farmer in the group , a man who was constantly trying and evaluating new varieties and new planting methods . He was aggressively interested in improved farming techniques , and welcomed both academic and field information that would support the growth of his farm . He was one of the few farmers we had met at that point who was always reading reports from the agricultural experimental stations , attending meetings and seminars . He also gave lectures to groups of farmers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses for the state university . We often consulted Bud when we ran into problems , but there was one time in particular when we called the Wallace farm in a state of panic . Mark and I had been lured by one or another of the gardening magazines that promised unheard-of profits , and we decided to raise a partial acre of onions from sets . We ordered four bushels , or one hundred and twenty pounds of sets , which translates into thousands and thousands of tiny onion bulbs , each the size of a dime . The sets arrived by truck , and we waited for the first suitable gray , cool , misty day to start our planting . We headed out into the field with the four bushels , thinking that we could plant everything in part of one day . Working on our knees , we inched our way down the rows , painstakingly pushing each bulb into the soil , being careful to space them evenly and to point them right side up . Some eight hours and three aching backs later ewe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of the bushels of bulbs . We were so frustrated that we figured there must be some secret to this whole process that we did n't understand , so that evening I called Bud . No , Bud did n't know of any other way to do it . So the next day we carried out only one bushel to plant . After four days of planting on our hands and knees , the entire undertaking went from bad to worse . The weeds grew faster than 48 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE we could control them with mechanical and hand cultivation , and by the end of the season we had five-foot-tall pigweed , knots of witchgrass , and onions not much larger than the bulbs we had originally put in . Years later , Bud remembered our call for help and revised his response , having learned himself that it is possible to drop sets quickly into shallow furrows , cover them , and tamp them down mechanically . The little bulbs will quite nicely sprout upwards to produce onions . As for the weed problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wallace farm will be conducting some experiments on the allelopathic properties of plants that could work as natural herbicides . The notion is that some crops inhibit the growth of other plants . If they were planted in some specific succession , then the soil would contain natural ingredients that keep certain weeds from growing . We look forward to the results of Bud 's work over the next few years . I also hope that there will be continuing pressure to support research for problems that plague organic gardeners . Many of the farmers we became acquainted with at the market had rather sizable amounts of acreage under cultivation . They were farming seven days a week on homesteads that had lots of cleared fields . In our case , the limits on our time to garden and the small space that we had for growing pressed us into thinking about farming in a particular way . Our acreage was very hilly , and most of the land , even if it was cleared , would not be suitable for row cropping . At most we could claim about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing the easiest old field , and that effort had proved to us that clearing land was not only difficult but costly . But even if we had had acres of flat fields , I am not certain that we would simply have continued to plow up more and more land each season . The challenge to us , as we saw it , was to coax small spaces into great productivity . That goal , defined early , has continued with us until this day . It has undergone scrutiny at the same time as we have looked at issues of economy and the aesthetic // development of our farm . Each person who chooses to raise crops ultimately has to find a scale for the operation that matches a whole range of expectations . Fortunately , both Mark and I have always been hungry for new information , and we began augmenting our field experience with as much reading about matters horticultural as we could afford . We began to collect books , reprints , brochures , textbooks , and catalogues . We went to libraries and bookstores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from vegetable gardening to beekeeping . At any given time , the reading material stacked up on my bedstand includes novels , newspapers , magazines , and scores of gardening manuals . As it turned out , some of the most useful information for our particular purposes came from horticultural books produced during the latter half of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth . In those days , farms were diverse operations , and the work was performed primarily by family members or a few hired hands . Land was maintained by careful cultivation and with animal fertilizers available from the farms themselves , and the plots were usually small and planted in rotation . Large-scale monoculture and chemical farming were not yet the predominant methods . Many of the leading positions of organic farming groups today are articulated soundly in the farming manuals of previous generations . One of my favorite old textbooks , titled Farm Management , by G. F. Warren , opens with a preface that reads : Long ages of experience and a generation of scientific research have resulted in a fund of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is less background of tradition concerning business methods on the farm , and colleges have given little attention to this kind of problem . The success of the individual farmer is as much dependent on the application of business principles as it is on crop yields and production of animals . An interesting excerpt , given the fact that it was written in 1913 . Oddly enough , for the past two years the Maine Department of 50 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Agriculture has begun to focus on the need to educate the state 's agricultural producers to become more astute businesspeople and marketers . Special funds have been allocated for seminars in using computers on the farm , assessing marketing opportunities , and looking at farm crops for their value-added potential . Despite the proliferation of gardening books with handsome covers and full-color illustrations , I would be loath to part with a very utilitarian-looking text produced in 1912 by Ralph L. Watts , dean and director of the School of Agriculture and Experimental Station of the Pennsylvania State College . There are chapters on soils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of hot beds , cold frames , and greenhouses . I mention only a few , because I am struck by his attitude in the chapter on insect enemies and diseases , which reads : Spraying is often necessary , but it is expensive and should not be employed ordinarily until all other practical means of prevention have failed . Single cropping or the want of proper rotation frequently causes trouble . When a crop pays unusually well , the temptation is to continue its cultivation upon the same ground for years ? a practice which harbors insects and diseases ... . When plants are kept in a thrifty condition there is reduced danger of serious loss from both insects and diseases . Judicious fertilizing , cultivating and watering may be worth far more in warding off attacks than any amount of spraying . These two reference works ? Warren 's and Watts 's books ? offer over one thousand pages of information and advice , well indexed and in most cases as current as I want . I found each of these for under a dollar at a used-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , and even when we are marshaling our funds very carefully , we almost never feel that we can not afford a book on gardening that offers some new bit of information or an opinion that will be helpful . And since I have become so indiscriminate a collector , I can offer only a somewhat eclectic list of suggested reading in the bibliography at the end of this book . Still , the list might be of some help , if // not in its specific titles , then by its suggestion that there are a number of ways in which to be interested in gardening . Our enthusiasm for literature on farming was not always shared by our neighbors or by members of the farmers ' market . When we referred in conversation to something we had learned by reading , we were often chided for our basic belief in " book learning , " as it was called . There were repeated variations on the opinion that farmers do not write books ; it is just those professors at the agricultural schools who write , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us cautiously edit our conversations with many of our rural peers . We were also criticized for being " publishing farmers " ourselves , as we began to develop some ideas for marketing our products with printed matter . Direct oral information was offered to us freely , and it was up to us to sort out the valid advice from the foolishness . Our farming community was seldom willing to review the questions that we brought from our reading . It was not until we had gardened for a couple of seasons , not until we began selling with other farmers , that I became interested in exploring the agricultural history of our community . Then I began to realize that as a gardener , I was joining the company of millions . And even though I was becoming aware of the fascination that people have always had for growing things , I was in no way prepared for the way in which gardening would become such an obsessive interest . The more we worked in the soil , the more we wanted time for the same . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations turned with increasing frequency to agricultural topics . We began to visit other farms in the state . We started going to meetings and seminars offered by the extension service or by the Department of Soil Conservation . We began to attend the annual agricultural trade shows in Maine and in the rest of New England . We put ourselves on the mailing lists of any agencies or companies that produced relevant publications . As we became more familiar with the people and issues in52 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE volved with agriculture , we began to notice that slight tensions existed between those farmers who used conventional techniques and those who farmed organically . But in our case , the choice to farm without chemicals was less a political statement than the outgrowth of the way we backed into farming for a living . Our first garden , under the Allens ' guidance , had been planted for ourselves , our families , and our friends . We had n't needed to use chemical herbicides or pesticides . When we were first confronted with the choice of whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want our own food to be sprayed . We were quite willing to sacrifice some crops , if necessary , for the advantage of having unadulterated food . Once we began to sell food to the public , it was n't possible , logistically or philosophically , to spray part of the crops for someone we did n't know and leave the rest of it clean for ourselves . There was never any question about our methods . Nor was there the full realization in the early years that our decision to farm without chemicals would affect our choice of crops , of land use , and of marketing strategies . In the early seventies , we were moving ahead much more simply . Now that we were spending so much time in Maine , we began to look a bit more critically at the farmhouse itself . Initially both of us were quite satisfied with its condition . It was superficially livable , and whatever changes I might have considered had more to do with cosmetic painting and papering than with any basic structural changes . When we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more substantial problems to contend with . In the basement , we had to replace a few sills and correct some of the foundation stonework . Each of the three chimneys turned out to be unlined , the bricks were cracking , and the masonry was crumbled or loose . The water from the bathroom and kitchen sinks simply ran through a rubber hose and emptied out of the side of the building onto the back lawn . The septic system was unsafe and threatened to contaminate the drinking well at any time . // If we had had the wit to understand how much work would be involved in putting our house back into shape , we would have been overwhelmed . But we realized the problems little by little , and the work was undertaken over a period of several years . We worked on the house mostly during the late fall and winter weekends . In the process , we undertook our first attempts at carpentry , our first work with bricks and mortar , plumbing and wiring . Mark and I were both fortunate to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , so even though we did not have the skills or the vocabulary of the different trades , we were not intimidated by the things we would need to learn . We bought new and used tools from hardware stores or country auctions . We borrowed from our families and neighbors . Repairing sills and foundations has got to be the most unsatisfying work that we did . All it left us with was the knowledge that the house stood more solidly on its base , but there was nothing to show for the hours of straining and grunting . Tearing down the chimneys was more gratifying , and the job left us with thousands of old bricks that I used to design walkways around the farmhouse . We replaced one of the single-flue chimneys with a double chimney , for a fireplace on one side and a stove on the other . It was a complicated project , so once Mark and I had built the footing for the whole structure , we hired an experienced mason , who agreed to take Mark on as his helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprentice , so that in the future we would be able to do our own simple masonry . We learned a lot of tricks from the mason about estimating materials , mixing mortar , breaking bricks accurately , grouting , pointing up . Like all the other things we were undertaking , the first step was acquiring the vocabulary . In the fall of 1973 , with the crops harvested , we turned our weekend attention to the construction of a root cellar and an addition to the back of the farmhouse . We hired a backhoe to dig the space for the foundation , which would measure sixteen by twenty by eight feet deep . We calculated how many cement blocks we would need and how much masonry cement and sand the job 54 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE would take , and had the supplies delivered . Laying the foundation took all our free time from late October to early December . Mark did most of the work with a friend who was staying at the farm . As the courses of cement blocks increased , the weather grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-gallon drum in the work area and kept a small fire going , so that there was at least one spot to warm your body and hands . On one of the especially dark and raw workdays , I remember , I gathered the speakers of our stereo and placed them close to the work area , thinking that music would ease the chore . Since I was warm and busy inside the farmhouse , I did n't think about the effect of the music on the mood of the workers , and I chose some Buxtehude organ music . It did n't take long for the laborers in the pit to call out that the glories of the Baroque organ did not resound well in a cold , eight-foot-deep hole . The next musical offering was something quite a bit lighter . The root cellar was finished and boarded over just before the snows came that winter . We left the floor uncemented and ran a small duct from the main heating system , located some twentyfive feet away in the front of the farmhouse . With the small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures never dipped below thirty-five to forty degrees , even during the coldest winter months . It became a good place to store our root crops : potatoes , carrots , beets , and turnips . Apples kept for months in the cellar , as did our winter storage cabbages , which we harvested by pulling them , roots and all , from the ground and then hung from hooks in the cellar 's ceiling . The outer leaves of the cabbages dry out after a few weeks , encasing the inner leaves of the heads . This way we always have fresh cabbage to use for months after their harvest . We also used the cellar to overwinter our gladiolus bulbs and dahlia tubers in large plastic bags filled with peat moss . The nicest surprise was the success we had with saving our geraniums , right in their pots , where they were allowed to die down and go dormant for the winter . In early spring we brought the // pots up into the farmhouse , trimmed back the dead tops , watered the rather stubby-looking plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year after year , the majority of the plants would survive , start sprouting new growth , and be ready to set outdoors with flowers already in blossom . It was such a small effort that I began to wonder why gardeners left their plants out to freeze and die each fall . Little by little during the next three years we built a room over the cellar , trying to design it so that it blended into the architecture of the existing farmhouse . We started by going to Mark 's father , a design engineer in Boston , to help us draw up plans for the addition . Aleksander not only gave us advice on how to build the addition , he gave us a wonderful present ? architectural drawings of our whole homestead . Using his plans , we studded the room with strong timbers and roof joists to carry the heavy loads of Maine snow . In retrospect , I realize that we overbuilt the addition , and we took quite a bit of ribbing from our neighbors , who used minimal studding for sheds and sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than small farmhouse additions , but I will say one thing for the addition : it will be standing long after the rest of the farmhouse has grown weary . Once the basic framing was done , we searched around the Boston contractors ' supply houses to find the least expensive sixover-six wooden windows to match those in the other parts of the building . When the room was finished , we were more than a little proud of our work . It blended nicely into the shape of the farmhouse . We now refer to our addition as the summer room , because we close it off when the weather turns cold in late October . But from mid-April until that time , it is the gathering place for family and friends and people who work with us . The room is dominated by a big old oak table that has lots of extra leaves to accommodate however many of us there are at mealtimes . It is interesting to reflect on the skills that we were teaching 56 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE ourselves in the country , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban and our rural lives . In the city we bouts nearly every service . If something happened to the plumbic , we called the building superintendent . If our car began to coug we took it to a mechanic . If we wanted houseplants , we bout them in full bloom from a greenhouse . In the country we were beginning to do most things for ourselves , either because the series were not easily available or because they were too expensi for us to consider . In fat one of the most significant things that we decided to do for ourselves , the winter after our second vegetable garden , was to : tempt to grow our own seedlings . As usual , we went out andought a few books and sent away for some publications . One of these books became our bible , and I would still recommend highly to beginners or experienced gardeners . It is called The Complete Book of Growing Plants from Seed , by Elda Haring . Haring ; ates early on that she is not a botanist but an enthusiast . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book not only provide good basic information about what seeds are and how they perform , it also offers encouragement to novice growers . Over at over , the author points out that this or that works for her , buthat every gardener should trust his or her own observation and experiences and use them to enrich conventional wisdom This spoke directly to the attitudes that I was beginning to devop . Our rst greenhouse , if you can call it that , was so primitive and ill-quipped that it is a wonder anything survived . In fact , it was set up in one of the farmhouse 's second-floor bedrooms . The room Nis on the south side of the house , so it received a modest amour of warmth and light from its one window . We emptied the rocs entirely of its furniture and filled it up again with plant tables fashioned out of four-by-eight plywood sheets that we turned into sIllow trays by nailing boards perpendicular to all four sides . hen we covered the trays with sheets of heavy plastic so that w could water the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description that winter , figuring that we could experiment freely and not have to buy all our seedlings from a commercial greenhouse next spring . With the Haring book always handy , we made our own soil mixes and seeded about fifty flats of vegetables , herbs , and flowers . We drenched everything with water and left the flats sitting in about two inches of water in the homemade plywood trays during the weekdays , when we were away at work . The first weekend after seeding , I think , nothing had germinated , undoubtedly because the farmhouse was heated only to fifty-five degrees on the days we were away . But by the second weekend there were dozens of tiny little cotyledons poking their heads above the soil . This time we had labeled our plants , so we knew what was supposed to be growing in the soil . Nonetheless , we confirmed our labels by comparing the early growth with the illustrations on the endpapers of the Haring book . Yes , our tag said " lupin " and the true leaves looked just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poppies , and that was basil . But no , that flat had a couple of different leaf shapes , and only two of them looked like the illustration for cosmos . About four weeks into our experiment , the plants were beginning to look rather leggy , so we had to rig up artificial lights to compensate for the room 's natural darkness . We made a trip to our favorite wrecking company south of Boston and rummaged around until we found some old industrial fixtures . We also found a supply of used fluorescent tubes and mixed those with a few new growing lights . We suspended the lights above each of the seedling trays and set them on automatic timers , so that the plants would benefit not only from more light but from a longer growing day . Watering was as awkward as the rest of the setup , because there was no plumbing on the second floor and we had to carry hundreds of gallons upstairs to our plants . It 's projects like this one that make you appreciate the phrase " beginner 's luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of greenhouse plants , I wonder that anything survived the con58 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE ditions we provided . When it came time to transplant the seedlings , we had hundreds of young plants in varying stages of vigor and legginess . The undertaking was so simple ; our " flats " were made up of leftover coffee cans , egg cartons , and aluminum baking trays . The look of the room , however , was irrelevant . What mattered was that we did grow some good plants , and we were encouraged to continue . We had watched the Aliens harden off their commercially grown seedlings , and we understood the need to help the plants go from the protected climate of our farmhouse to the stress of temperature changes , sun , and wind in the fields . So next we built our first outside greenhouse , which was even more primitive than the one inside . It consisted of a four-foot-high A-frame covered with plastic . You had to crawl in and out of the thing , which we set up on the south lawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , but as the weather grew milder we began to leave them outside . During the weekdays , my parents or a neighbor would drive over to the farm and water the plants , and if the nights threatened to turn very cold , someone would throw several blankets over the outdoor shelter . I remember being so pleased with our results that I offered to provide the Allens with some seedlings . They politely accepted some marigolds . There was no way that they were going to trust their income crops to our experiments . I remember feeling a bit insulted at the time , but when farming provided my major income some years later , I revised my thinking . If I try to evaluate our earliest years at the farm , I realize that we undertook projects in area after area in which we had little or no experience . In each case , however , people were available as teachers , and there was abundant information that we could borrow , buy , or simply ask to have . We ventured into new territory and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the confidence we had in our urban capabilities . And the satisfactions of learning always reinforced our eagerness to move ahead . // It is fair to say that we take on new projects now in fairly deliberate and aggressive ways , but that whole approach is based on some early achievements in all areas of rural living . Each of the skills was significant , but the most important lesson was our growing willingness to rely on ourselves . It is also pertinent to remember that very little of what we were doing was new in the specific sense . All the plants that we raised as crops had been cultivated for years , if not for centuries . All of the carpentry that we were doing was based on some fairly ancient and standard architectural formulas . The attempts that we later made to construct energy-efficient structures were undertaken only after hours of research into the literature that had been produced over the past two decades . If we challenged or modified existing ideas , we did so only after we had made enough mistakes or observations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more basic skills to our inventory , like working on machinery , welding , and learning how to use a computer . There are few mysteries in the skills we have needed to acquire . We recognize what we need to study when we are struggling from lack of information or ability . And I can now say that probably we are less worried about what we do not know than intrigued by the process of having so many new things to learn , so much new information to gather . The development of these attitudes has become the source of our continuing enthusiasm for life in the country . 4 ? NOTES ON A DOUBLE LIFE FR OM 19 7 3 UNTIL 19 7 8 , Mark and I continued to juggle our professional careers in Boston with what I now think of as our farming apprenticeship in Maine . Initially , it did not occur to either of us that we would want to give up one for the other . They were so different that each served as a vantage point from which we looked at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues in publishing and academia , and our weekends were peopled with colleagues who were laborers and vendors . From early spring until late fall , our Maine work was increasingly dominated by our involvement with the farmers ' markets , first in Lewiston , but eventually throughout the state . The first group of Lewiston sellers adopted as its name the Androscoggin Farmers ' Market , and after a couple of years of sponsoring only one location , we expanded with two more marketing sites . The // first was in Auburn , Lewiston 's twin city , and the second was in Rumford , another Maine mill town , located about twenty miles northwest of our farm . Mark and I also joined a farmers ' association that organized a different membership nearer the Portland area . During these years , farmers ' markets were developing not just in Maine but all over the country . They were springing up in small rural pockets , sometimes with the support of federal funding , sometimes through the efforts of the national organic farming movement . Markets also began to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPhee in a 1978 New Yorker article on the first green market in New York City . The similarities between the large urban markets and the small rural ones could not be missed . Full-time farmers , part-time farmers , and backyard gardeners were given the opportunity to bring their fresh produce into towns and cities , to set up instant stores on makeshift tables or on the tailgates of their trucks , and to sell the best portion of a day 's pick to enthusiastic consumers . It was a simple idea , with a timely political appeal . Coming in the early seventies , the markets coincided neatly with the needs of those cities , large and small , that were witnessing the decline of their original downtown commercial sections . With the growth of suburban malls , large numbers of shoppers had been drawn away from inner cities . As a result , merchants ' associations and chambers of commerce were working to try to stimulate activity once again in the old downtown sections . In Lewiston , Auburn , and Rumford , the farmers were welcomed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even provided with some financial support for advertising and insurance . In Portland , however , the market did not locate in the downtown section , because an outdoor produce market was already there . This market was like the one that McPhee described , made up of a combination of real farmers and food retailers who simply bought and resold produce that might have been grown anywhere in the world , depending on the season . The 3 ? APPRENTICESHIP WE TACKLED our second vegetable garden with the confidence of true sophomores . Preparing the land was considerably easier because most of the small brush and roots had rotted beneath the winter snow , and the previous summer of cultivation meant that there was little remaining sod . Once again we hired other farmers to do the plowing and harrowing . We now had at least some idea of the order in which work was done . As with any new undertaking , one of the first hurdles to overcome was the acquisition of a working vocabulary . The previous season had provided us with names of tasks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of talking about the weather that are peculiar only to farmers . If memory serves me well , the Allens had a chestnut gelding that year . They expected us to borrow their horse again , and they were prepared to advise us through another season . They ordered // extra flats of tomato , pepper , cabbage , and broccoli plants for us , but we chose our own seeds from a variety of companies that we had become acquainted with over the winter . We added a number of vegetables to our garden , including melons , onions , cauliflowers , summer squashes , radishes , and beans for drying . We did not , however , cut down very much on the amounts of our first-year plantings , so by July we began harvesting prodigious amounts of vegetables . We bought a freezer and began to freeze and can even more of our crops than we had the year before . There was still a surplus of food . One weekend late in June , a neighbor called to tell us that she heard on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewiston , only twenty miles from our farm . She thought we might be interested . Quite on impulse , I called the Cooperative Extension Service that was heading up the effort , and I was told that the first market was open to anyone who had his or her own produce to sell . The markets would begin in two weeks , on Saturday mornings at seven-thirty , in a parking lot donated by one of Lewiston 's Franco-American snowshoe clubs . Mark and I decided to go . About eight vehicles showed up for that first market . We were quite a collection . In addition to Mark and me , there were fulltime truck farmers , retired mill workers who were farming parttime , weekend gardeners , and a couple of craftspeople , since the first market was billed as a combination farmers ' and crafters ' market . The vehicles were as varied as the sellers , ranging from station wagons carrying a few baskets of vegetables to threequarter-ton pickups with hundreds of pounds of produce . Since there was no prearranged market plan , we stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone had arrived , we were randomly positioned in a gravel parking lot , fenced in by a tall chain-link fence and overshadowed by a huge billboard . The early morning sun cast some thankful relief on that rather dingy spot . Mark and I were two of the first to arrive , because we had so 42 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE little to sell that it had taken us no time to prepare our truck . We had picked most of the vegetables the evening before and outfitted our truck with an assortment of wooden apple crates and pieces of plywood , from which we made a display table . We arranged our goods on the table and marked each item with a quickly lettered price card . You could sense a certain amount of tension on that first market day : each farmer was eyeing the others , wondering what the others had brought , what they would charge , and if there would be enough customers to make the trip worthwhile . Most of the other sellers had a history of selling from their trucks , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local supermarkets and restaurants when they could . This was the first attempt in our area to bring farmers together to cooperate while they were simultaneously competing against one another . Customers began arriving even before we were able to finish setting up . In a matter of one and a half hours , Mark and I had sold all of our extra garden produce for $18.75 . We were absolutely delighted . The relationship of the money to the effort it had taken to acquire it had no influence on our reactions ; the pleasure came entirely from the experience of producing something tangible and then selling it directly to the consumer . Other farmers also sold all of their produce , and there was an air of excitement and optimism that seemed to be shared by sellers and buyers alike . After packing our truck with empty baskets , boxes , and boards , we headed back to the farm , making plans for the next Saturday market . That same afternoon Mark and I walked up and down the rows of our garden , trying to evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for harvest by the end of the week , for the second market . And so it went for the next seven weeks . Our weekly sales grew from $18.75 to an all-time high of $61.34 during the middle of August , when all the crops were producing heavily . At the final day of the market in September , we took in $49.38. // During the heaviest production in August , we had more cucumbers , summer squashes , and cabbage than we could sell at the farmers ' market , so we brought our produce to a small grocery store where we often bought supplies . The buyer agreed to take our vegetables . Then , at the end of the season , we exchanged twelve bushels of potatoes for sixty dollars ' worth of milk from a neighbor 's dairy . According to my records , our last sale was made on November 1 , when we earned $11.31 for some parsnips and turnips . When we added everything together , we discovered that we had taken in $498.4 3 from our second garden . Our entry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , we counted every penny of income as real profit , and in the most naive sense , I suppose , it was . Those vegetables would have been given away or discarded if we had not sold them . The naive belief that anything that can be sold is profit would continue to play an ever-increasing role in our notions about farming for a living . But since we were not forced to look at the expenses of farming , in that summer of 1973 , we never complicated the questions of pricing , profits , and losses . We were not at that time a family that needed to sustain itself on an agricultural income . I am able to report our first sales figures to the exact penny because I began taking notes on our selling activities at the outset . I go back now to the first set of records we ever had , notes gathered in an old spiral-bound college notebook left over from one class or another . I continued to use the same notebook for the next four years , until all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others with random narrative information . This record keeping , started out of mild curiosity , has been the underpinning of all the business growth and whatever successes we have had . As the years progressed , the notes became more deliberate and more detailed . The weeks of selling were numbered , the crop prices were included , and the field space devoted to crops was noted . I began to include information on the weather , the harvest dates for the crops , the peak seasons for production and sales . I 44 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE included a sentence or two about how the weather or holidays affected the crowds at the markets . I gathered some of the information just for its sentimental value , and it has been enjoyable and amusing to reread dates for and comments on setting out the grape arbor , trenching and planting one hundred asparagus roots , and transplanting two young maples to the newly planted lawn on the west side of the farmhouse . After only a couple of years of keeping a journal , I could begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I realized that data collection was becoming increasingly important . But our rather compulsive record keeping was often the subject of ridicule and criticism at the farmers ' market . Other sellers seemed overly aware of our note taking , and we were asked by many members why we bothered to record each and every sale . We were told that it was ridiculous to try to write down information when the crowds were heavy and we were trying to wait on people . Numerous older farmers at the markets said that they knew how much they planted and approximately how much they made . The challenge for them lay principally in having the earliest crops of the favorite fruits and vegetables ? they were competing to have the first corn , tomatoes , cucumbers , beans , and apples . Beyond that , there was very little sophistication in the marketing strategies of most of our peers in those early days . Despite the criticism we received , I knew instinctively that we needed real information to remind us of our summer 's activities , information that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional reason for my tenacity in record keeping . Mark and I were new and part-time growers , with no plans to give up our city lives . Our farming was limited to weekends and summer vacations , and even at the outset , I was interested in seeing how a finite amount of time and space given to gardening could be managed to yield the best produce and income . Each year , during the winter months ? time we now refer to as farming on the kitchen table ? Mark and I would study our notes , evaluate the same one-acre plot of cultivated land , // count out its rows , estimate the hours of time we would have to work the land , and try to come up with a plan that would give us the greatest returns . We were asking not only for more income but for the opportunity to learn about new vegetable varieties . It became important to be able to compare the relationship of space , costs , and time , because we were having to mete out our energies carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although most of the other sellers at the market may not have shared our belief in record keeping , there were a few who recognized the sincerity of our interest in market gardening . As it turned out , they were the most successful growers among the membership , and they became our teachers , along with the Allens As the market grew in membership and popularity , each of us adopted a permanent location , and so Clarence Bradbury became our constant Saturday neighbor . Clarence , who had retired to Maine from Connecticut , where he had operated a junkyard , was one of the first members of the Lewiston farmers ' market . He farmed about twenty acres of land and specialized in growing tomatoes . Regardless of the season , he always had the first ripe fruit for sale , and over the years many of us tried to challenge his lead . None of us ever succeeded . Raising early tomatoes was only one of Clarence 's skills , however . He paid a great deal of attention to marketing . Regardless of the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seller to arrive at the market , so that he would have plenty of time to arrange his produce in an attractive display before the early morning shoppers came . Some of the other producers ( almost always the less successful ones ) would drive their trucks into place once the market was under way , and they never got properly set up for the day . Some members would fail to show up on a stormy Saturday , or they would not bother to come for the earliest and latest marketing dates , when their gardens were not producing heavily . But Clarence always came , and always arrived first . 46 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Not only was the Bradbury display the most attractive ; the Bradbury display had the best salesman . Clarence loved to sell , or so it appeared . He worked very hard with each potential customer . If he could catch the attention of a passerby , he would engage him or her in conversation about the weather , the quality of his food , his farm , why he chose to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers information about using the food . Inevitably , during the conversation he would bag up a pound of this or that . He never sat on the tailgate of his truck waiting for someone to ask him a question . His manner was friendly and persuasive . Even when he did n't have a customer in front of his stand , he kept busy arranging and adjusting his display . He is one of the few farmers I have known who put as much effort into selling his wares as into growing them . Fortunately , Clarence took it upon himself to instruct Mark and me . Frequently he would walk over to our truck and ask us how we were doing . He showed us how to keep a product selling by constantly moving it into smaller and smaller boxes , so that the last of the food still looked plentiful as it mounded up over the top of its container . " You can never sell the last of anything if it is sitting in the bottom of a big box , " he warned us repeatedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some were more reliable than others in our climate . He suggested some varieties that had more eye appeal than others . He critiqued our display , reminding us to set up alternating colors and shapes of produce ? a criticism that embarrassed me , a designer from Boston , working on a national magazine : I had forgotten to apply some basic design principles to my own wares . Bud Wallace also attracted a substantial following at the earliest farmers ' markets . He was the first member of the group to advertise that he farmed organically . He was , in fact , one of the earliest members of the organic farmers ' movement in Maine . Lest you picture him as a hirsute , barefooted young back-to-the - lander , let me inform you that Bud was a chain-smoking , cleanshaven , baseball-cap-wearing fifty-year-old who , like Clarence , // retired to Maine from Connecticut . He was also an informed horticulturalist and , like Clarence , generous with advice for newcomers Bud was perhaps the most intellectually curious farmer in the group , a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . He was aggressively interested in improved farming techniques , and welcomed both academic and field information that would support the growth of his farm . He was one of the few farmers we had met at that point who was always reading reports from the agricultural experimental stations , attending meetings and seminars . He also gave lectures to groups of farmers and home gardeners , and has since gone on to teach courses for the state university . We often consulted Bud when we ran into problems , but there was one time in particular when we called the Wallace farm in a state of panic . Mark and I had been lured by one or another of the gardening magazines that promised unheard-of profits , and we decided to raise a partial acre of onions from sets . We ordered four bushels , or one hundred and twenty pounds of sets , which translates into thousands and thousands of tiny onion bulbs , each the size of a dime . The sets arrived by truck , and we waited for the first suitable gray , cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the field with the four bushels , thinking that we could plant everything in part of one day . Working on our knees , we inched our way down the rows , painstakingly pushing each bulb into the soil , being careful to space them evenly and to point them right side up . Some eight hours and three aching backs later ewe had help that time ) , we had managed to plant only one of the bushels of bulbs . We were so frustrated that we figured there must be some secret to this whole process that we did n't understand , so that evening I called Bud . No , Bud did n't know of any other way to do it . So the next day we carried out only one bushel to plant . After four days of planting on our hands and knees , the entire undertaking went from bad to worse . The weeds grew faster than 48 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE we could control them with mechanical and hand cultivation , and by the end of the season we had five-foot-tall pigweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the bulbs we had originally put in . Years later , Bud remembered our call for help and revised his response , having learned himself that it is possible to drop sets quickly into shallow furrows , cover them , and tamp them down mechanically . The little bulbs will quite nicely sprout upwards to produce onions . As for the weed problems , Bud could write volumes . Just recently I learned that the Wallace farm will be conducting some experiments on the allelopathic properties of plants that could work as natural herbicides . The notion is that some crops inhibit the growth of other plants . If they were planted in some specific succession , then the soil would contain natural ingredients that keep certain weeds from growing . We look forward to the results of Bud 's work over the next few years . I also hope that there will be continuing pressure to support research for problems that plague organic gardeners . Many of the farmers we became acquainted with at the market had rather sizable amounts of acreage under cultivation . They were farming seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . In our case , the limits on our time to garden and the small space that we had for growing pressed us into thinking about farming in a particular way . Our acreage was very hilly , and most of the land , even if it was cleared , would not be suitable for row cropping . At most we could claim about ten acres for tillage . We had begun gardening by clearing the easiest old field , and that effort had proved to us that clearing land was not only difficult but costly . But even if we had had acres of flat fields , I am not certain that we would simply have continued to plow up more and more land each season . The challenge to us , as we saw it , was to coax small spaces into great productivity . That goal , defined early , has continued with us until this day . It has undergone scrutiny at the same time as we have looked at issues of economy and the aesthetic // development of our farm . Each person who chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation that matches a whole range of expectations . Fortunately , both Mark and I have always been hungry for new information , and we began augmenting our field experience with as much reading about matters horticultural as we could afford . We began to collect books , reprints , brochures , textbooks , and catalogues . We went to libraries and bookstores , and wrote away to companies and manufacturers on subjects ranging from vegetable gardening to beekeeping . At any given time , the reading material stacked up on my bedstand includes novels , newspapers , magazines , and scores of gardening manuals . As it turned out , some of the most useful information for our particular purposes came from horticultural books produced during the latter half of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth . In those days , farms were diverse operations , and the work was performed primarily by family members or a few hired hands . Land was maintained by careful cultivation and with animal fertilizers available from the farms themselves , and the plots were usually small and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the predominant methods . Many of the leading positions of organic farming groups today are articulated soundly in the farming manuals of previous generations . One of my favorite old textbooks , titled Farm Management , by G. F. Warren , opens with a preface that reads : Long ages of experience and a generation of scientific research have resulted in a fund of popular knowledge on how to raise crops and animals . But there is less background of tradition concerning business methods on the farm , and colleges have given little attention to this kind of problem . The success of the individual farmer is as much dependent on the application of business principles as it is on crop yields and production of animals . An interesting excerpt , given the fact that it was written in 1913 . Oddly enough , for the past two years the Maine Department of 50 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Agriculture has begun to focus on the need to educate the state 's agricultural producers to become more astute businesspeople and marketers . Special funds have been allocated for seminars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at farm crops for their value-added potential . Despite the proliferation of gardening books with handsome covers and full-color illustrations , I would be loath to part with a very utilitarian-looking text produced in 1912 by Ralph L. Watts , dean and director of the School of Agriculture and Experimental Station of the Pennsylvania State College . There are chapters on soils , animal manures , green manures and cover crops , the construction of hot beds , cold frames , and greenhouses . I mention only a few , because I am struck by his attitude in the chapter on insect enemies and diseases , which reads : Spraying is often necessary , but it is expensive and should not be employed ordinarily until all other practical means of prevention have failed . Single cropping or the want of proper rotation frequently causes trouble . When a crop pays unusually well , the temptation is to continue its cultivation upon the same ground for years ? a practice which harbors insects and diseases ... . When plants are kept in a thrifty condition there is reduced danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cultivating and watering may be worth far more in warding off attacks than any amount of spraying . These two reference works ? Warren 's and Watts 's books ? offer over one thousand pages of information and advice , well indexed and in most cases as current as I want . I found each of these for under a dollar at a used-book sale . Admittedly , people have different motives for buying books , and even when we are marshaling our funds very carefully , we almost never feel that we can not afford a book on gardening that offers some new bit of information or an opinion that will be helpful . And since I have become so indiscriminate a collector , I can offer only a somewhat eclectic list of suggested reading in the bibliography at the end of this book . Still , the list might be of some help , if // not in its specific titles , then by its suggestion that there are a number of ways in which to be interested in gardening . Our enthusiasm for literature on farming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers ' market . When we referred in conversation to something we had learned by reading , we were often chided for our basic belief in " book learning , " as it was called . There were repeated variations on the opinion that farmers do not write books ; it is just those professors at the agricultural schools who write , but they do n't actually run farms . This strong prejudice made us cautiously edit our conversations with many of our rural peers . We were also criticized for being " publishing farmers " ourselves , as we began to develop some ideas for marketing our products with printed matter . Direct oral information was offered to us freely , and it was up to us to sort out the valid advice from the foolishness . Our farming community was seldom willing to review the questions that we brought from our reading . It was not until we had gardened for a couple of seasons , not until we began selling with other farmers , that I became interested in exploring the agricultural history of our community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was joining the company of millions . And even though I was becoming aware of the fascination that people have always had for growing things , I was in no way prepared for the way in which gardening would become such an obsessive interest . The more we worked in the soil , the more we wanted time for the same . The more we read , the more books we wanted . Our conversations turned with increasing frequency to agricultural topics . We began to visit other farms in the state . We started going to meetings and seminars offered by the extension service or by the Department of Soil Conservation . We began to attend the annual agricultural trade shows in Maine and in the rest of New England . We put ourselves on the mailing lists of any agencies or companies that produced relevant publications . As we became more familiar with the people and issues in52 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE volved with agriculture , we began to notice that slight tensions existed between those farmers who used conventional techniques and those who farmed organically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals was less a political statement than the outgrowth of the way we backed into farming for a living . Our first garden , under the Allens ' guidance , had been planted for ourselves , our families , and our friends . We had n't needed to use chemical herbicides or pesticides . When we were first confronted with the choice of whether to combat diseases with chemicals , we felt that we did n't want our own food to be sprayed . We were quite willing to sacrifice some crops , if necessary , for the advantage of having unadulterated food . Once we began to sell food to the public , it was n't possible , logistically or philosophically , to spray part of the crops for someone we did n't know and leave the rest of it clean for ourselves . There was never any question about our methods . Nor was there the full realization in the early years that our decision to farm without chemicals would affect our choice of crops , of land use , and of marketing strategies . In the early seventies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were spending so much time in Maine , we began to look a bit more critically at the farmhouse itself . Initially both of us were quite satisfied with its condition . It was superficially livable , and whatever changes I might have considered had more to do with cosmetic painting and papering than with any basic structural changes . When we started to take a closer look , we realized that we had more substantial problems to contend with . In the basement , we had to replace a few sills and correct some of the foundation stonework . Each of the three chimneys turned out to be unlined , the bricks were cracking , and the masonry was crumbled or loose . The water from the bathroom and kitchen sinks simply ran through a rubber hose and emptied out of the side of the building onto the back lawn . The septic system was unsafe and threatened to contaminate the drinking well at any time . // If we had had the wit to understand how much work would be involved in putting our house back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized the problems little by little , and the work was undertaken over a period of several years . We worked on the house mostly during the late fall and winter weekends . In the process , we undertook our first attempts at carpentry , our first work with bricks and mortar , plumbing and wiring . Mark and I were both fortunate to have come from families who had done considerable amounts of work of this kind , so even though we did not have the skills or the vocabulary of the different trades , we were not intimidated by the things we would need to learn . We bought new and used tools from hardware stores or country auctions . We borrowed from our families and neighbors . Repairing sills and foundations has got to be the most unsatisfying work that we did . All it left us with was the knowledge that the house stood more solidly on its base , but there was nothing to show for the hours of straining and grunting . Tearing down the chimneys was more gratifying , and the job left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkways around the farmhouse . We replaced one of the single-flue chimneys with a double chimney , for a fireplace on one side and a stove on the other . It was a complicated project , so once Mark and I had built the footing for the whole structure , we hired an experienced mason , who agreed to take Mark on as his helper . That way , one of us was able to apprentice , so that in the future we would be able to do our own simple masonry . We learned a lot of tricks from the mason about estimating materials , mixing mortar , breaking bricks accurately , grouting , pointing up . Like all the other things we were undertaking , the first step was acquiring the vocabulary . In the fall of 1973 , with the crops harvested , we turned our weekend attention to the construction of a root cellar and an addition to the back of the farmhouse . We hired a backhoe to dig the space for the foundation , which would measure sixteen by twenty by eight feet deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much masonry cement and sand the job 54 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE would take , and had the supplies delivered . Laying the foundation took all our free time from late October to early December . Mark did most of the work with a friend who was staying at the farm . As the courses of cement blocks increased , the weather grew increasingly cold and stormy . We centered a big old fifty-gallon drum in the work area and kept a small fire going , so that there was at least one spot to warm your body and hands . On one of the especially dark and raw workdays , I remember , I gathered the speakers of our stereo and placed them close to the work area , thinking that music would ease the chore . Since I was warm and busy inside the farmhouse , I did n't think about the effect of the music on the mood of the workers , and I chose some Buxtehude organ music . It did n't take long for the laborers in the pit to call out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold , eight-foot-deep hole . The next musical offering was something quite a bit lighter . The root cellar was finished and boarded over just before the snows came that winter . We left the floor uncemented and ran a small duct from the main heating system , located some twentyfive feet away in the front of the farmhouse . With the small amount of heat that traveled to the root cellar , the temperatures never dipped below thirty-five to forty degrees , even during the coldest winter months . It became a good place to store our root crops : potatoes , carrots , beets , and turnips . Apples kept for months in the cellar , as did our winter storage cabbages , which we harvested by pulling them , roots and all , from the ground and then hung from hooks in the cellar 's ceiling . The outer leaves of the cabbages dry out after a few weeks , encasing the inner leaves of the heads . This way we always have fresh cabbage to use for months after their harvest . We also used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large plastic bags filled with peat moss . The nicest surprise was the success we had with saving our geraniums , right in their pots , where they were allowed to die down and go dormant for the winter . In early spring we brought the // pots up into the farmhouse , trimmed back the dead tops , watered the rather stubby-looking plants , and set them in a warm , sunny place . Year after year , the majority of the plants would survive , start sprouting new growth , and be ready to set outdoors with flowers already in blossom . It was such a small effort that I began to wonder why gardeners left their plants out to freeze and die each fall . Little by little during the next three years we built a room over the cellar , trying to design it so that it blended into the architecture of the existing farmhouse . We started by going to Mark 's father , a design engineer in Boston , to help us draw up plans for the addition . Aleksander not only gave us advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful present ? architectural drawings of our whole homestead . Using his plans , we studded the room with strong timbers and roof joists to carry the heavy loads of Maine snow . In retrospect , I realize that we overbuilt the addition , and we took quite a bit of ribbing from our neighbors , who used minimal studding for sheds and sap houses . Aleksander was more accustomed to designing petrochemical plants than small farmhouse additions , but I will say one thing for the addition : it will be standing long after the rest of the farmhouse has grown weary . Once the basic framing was done , we searched around the Boston contractors ' supply houses to find the least expensive sixover-six wooden windows to match those in the other parts of the building . When the room was finished , we were more than a little proud of our work . It blended nicely into the shape of the farmhouse . We now refer to our addition as the summer room , because we close it off when the weather turns cold in late October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering place for family and friends and people who work with us . The room is dominated by a big old oak table that has lots of extra leaves to accommodate however many of us there are at mealtimes . It is interesting to reflect on the skills that we were teaching 56 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE ourselves in the country , because they point out the polarity that was devoping between our urban and our rural lives . In the city we bouts nearly every service . If something happened to the plumbic , we called the building superintendent . If our car began to coug we took it to a mechanic . If we wanted houseplants , we bout them in full bloom from a greenhouse . In the country we were beginning to do most things for ourselves , either because the series were not easily available or because they were too expensi for us to consider . In fat one of the most significant things that we decided to do for ourselves , the winter after our second vegetable garden , was to : tempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out andought a few books and sent away for some publications . One of these books became our bible , and I would still recommend highly to beginners or experienced gardeners . It is called The Complete Book of Growing Plants from Seed , by Elda Haring . Haring ; ates early on that she is not a botanist but an enthusiast . She ha ; however , done her homework , and the book not only provide good basic information about what seeds are and how they perform , it also offers encouragement to novice growers . Over at over , the author points out that this or that works for her , buthat every gardener should trust his or her own observation and experiences and use them to enrich conventional wisdom This spoke directly to the attitudes that I was beginning to devop . Our rst greenhouse , if you can call it that , was so primitive and ill-quipped that it is a wonder anything survived . In fact , it was set up in one of the farmhouse 's second-floor bedrooms . The room Nis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest amour of warmth and light from its one window . We emptied the rocs entirely of its furniture and filled it up again with plant tables fashioned out of four-by-eight plywood sheets that we turned into sIllow trays by nailing boards perpendicular to all four sides . hen we covered the trays with sheets of heavy plastic so that w could water the plants in them . We ordered seeds of // every description that winter , figuring that we could experiment freely and not have to buy all our seedlings from a commercial greenhouse next spring . With the Haring book always handy , we made our own soil mixes and seeded about fifty flats of vegetables , herbs , and flowers . We drenched everything with water and left the flats sitting in about two inches of water in the homemade plywood trays during the weekdays , when we were away at work . The first weekend after seeding , I think , nothing had germinated , undoubtedly because the farmhouse was heated only to fifty-five degrees on the days we were away . But by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads above the soil . This time we had labeled our plants , so we knew what was supposed to be growing in the soil . Nonetheless , we confirmed our labels by comparing the early growth with the illustrations on the endpapers of the Haring book . Yes , our tag said " lupin " and the true leaves looked just like the drawing . And yes , those were marigolds and California poppies , and that was basil . But no , that flat had a couple of different leaf shapes , and only two of them looked like the illustration for cosmos . About four weeks into our experiment , the plants were beginning to look rather leggy , so we had to rig up artificial lights to compensate for the room 's natural darkness . We made a trip to our favorite wrecking company south of Boston and rummaged around until we found some old industrial fixtures . We also found a supply of used fluorescent tubes and mixed those with a few new growing lights . We suspended the lights above each of the seedling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants would benefit not only from more light but from a longer growing day . Watering was as awkward as the rest of the setup , because there was no plumbing on the second floor and we had to carry hundreds of gallons upstairs to our plants . It 's projects like this one that make you appreciate the phrase " beginner 's luck . " Knowing what I do now about the fickleness of greenhouse plants , I wonder that anything survived the con58 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE ditions we provided . When it came time to transplant the seedlings , we had hundreds of young plants in varying stages of vigor and legginess . The undertaking was so simple ; our " flats " were made up of leftover coffee cans , egg cartons , and aluminum baking trays . The look of the room , however , was irrelevant . What mattered was that we did grow some good plants , and we were encouraged to continue . We had watched the Aliens harden off their commercially grown seedlings , and we understood the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmhouse to the stress of temperature changes , sun , and wind in the fields . So next we built our first outside greenhouse , which was even more primitive than the one inside . It consisted of a four-foot-high A-frame covered with plastic . You had to crawl in and out of the thing , which we set up on the south lawn . At first we put the plants outside only during the days , but as the weather grew milder we began to leave them outside . During the weekdays , my parents or a neighbor would drive over to the farm and water the plants , and if the nights threatened to turn very cold , someone would throw several blankets over the outdoor shelter . I remember being so pleased with our results that I offered to provide the Allens with some seedlings . They politely accepted some marigolds . There was no way that they were going to trust their income crops to our experiments . I remember feeling a bit insulted at the time , but when farming provided my major income some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evaluate our earliest years at the farm , I realize that we undertook projects in area after area in which we had little or no experience . In each case , however , people were available as teachers , and there was abundant information that we could borrow , buy , or simply ask to have . We ventured into new territory and our ignorance seldom threatened us , probably because we were buffered by the confidence we had in our urban capabilities . And the satisfactions of learning always reinforced our eagerness to move ahead . // It is fair to say that we take on new projects now in fairly deliberate and aggressive ways , but that whole approach is based on some early achievements in all areas of rural living . Each of the skills was significant , but the most important lesson was our growing willingness to rely on ourselves . It is also pertinent to remember that very little of what we were doing was new in the specific sense . All the plants that we raised as crops had been cultivated for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were doing was based on some fairly ancient and standard architectural formulas . The attempts that we later made to construct energy-efficient structures were undertaken only after hours of research into the literature that had been produced over the past two decades . If we challenged or modified existing ideas , we did so only after we had made enough mistakes or observations to adjust our plans . Over the years we have added more basic skills to our inventory , like working on machinery , welding , and learning how to use a computer . There are few mysteries in the skills we have needed to acquire . We recognize what we need to study when we are struggling from lack of information or ability . And I can now say that probably we are less worried about what we do not know than intrigued by the process of having so many new things to learn , so much new information to gather . The development of these attitudes has become the source of our continuing enthusiasm for life in the country . 4 ? NOTES ON A DOUBLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark and I continued to juggle our professional careers in Boston with what I now think of as our farming apprenticeship in Maine . Initially , it did not occur to either of us that we would want to give up one for the other . They were so different that each served as a vantage point from which we looked at the other with affection and amusement . Our weekdays were peopled with colleagues in publishing and academia , and our weekends were peopled with colleagues who were laborers and vendors . From early spring until late fall , our Maine work was increasingly dominated by our involvement with the farmers ' markets , first in Lewiston , but eventually throughout the state . The first group of Lewiston sellers adopted as its name the Androscoggin Farmers ' Market , and after a couple of years of sponsoring only one location , we expanded with two more marketing sites . The // first was in Auburn , Lewiston 's twin city , and the second was in Rumford , another Maine mill town , located about twenty miles northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers ' association that organized a different membership nearer the Portland area . During these years , farmers ' markets were developing not just in Maine but all over the country . They were springing up in small rural pockets , sometimes with the support of federal funding , sometimes through the efforts of the national organic farming movement . Markets also began to make their appearance in large cities , as chronicled by John McPhee in a 1978 New Yorker article on the first green market in New York City . The similarities between the large urban markets and the small rural ones could not be missed . Full-time farmers , part-time farmers , and backyard gardeners were given the opportunity to bring their fresh produce into towns and cities , to set up instant stores on makeshift tables or on the tailgates of their trucks , and to sell the best portion of a day 's pick to enthusiastic consumers . It was a simple idea , with a timely political appeal . Coming in the early seventies , the markets coincided neatly with the needs of those cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their original downtown commercial sections . With the growth of suburban malls , large numbers of shoppers had been drawn away from inner cities . As a result , merchants ' associations and chambers of commerce were working to try to stimulate activity once again in the old downtown sections . In Lewiston , Auburn , and Rumford , the farmers were welcomed by the business community , given free space for selling , and even provided with some financial support for advertising and insurance . In Portland , however , the market did not locate in the downtown section , because an outdoor produce market was already there . This market was like the one that McPhee described , made up of a combination of real farmers and food retailers who simply bought and resold produce that might have been grown anywhere in the world , depending on the season . The 62 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE newly created Portland group that we joined , made up exclusively of working farmers , chose not to compete with this market , but to accept an offer made by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . The mall developers were looking for marketing ideas and thought that an outdoor farmers ' market would be an attraction , so we were given physical space , along with some advertising support in the mall 's media campaigns . During this same period , many agricultural colleges throughout the country were beginning to assist farmers with marketing strategies , and agricultural extension personnel were often available to help markets organize . Some extension agents were more aggressive and more effective than others , but in nearly every county in Maine at least some attention was given to helping farmers set up direct marketing groups . We were able to use the county extension agency 's offices for meetings , and agency staff distributed information and meeting minutes . We had the use of phones and the franking privileges of a government office , which allowed us to do organizing work without the ordinary financial burdens . The coordinating function and the simple availability of space , money , and sympathetic staff people were invaluable in the early years . If it were n't for this support , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drawn into such cooperative attempts . Both Mark and I found our participation in farmers ' markets a real adventure . Each of us had had some experience with political activities in college and in the civil rights and war protests of the sixties . By comparison , the organizing of farmers ' markets seemed infinitely more manageable . The markets were naturally appealing to sellers and buyers , and the first stages of getting them going were not complex . But working with farmers ' markets was an education in a number of areas that Mark and I had heretofore not appreciated . We needed to learn quickly how to grow new and different crops . We needed to think about the presentation of these products to consumers , about what equipment we needed to own or hire , // and about what efforts we would have to make to cultivate a group of customers . On a different but equally important level was the whole question of how a number of independent farmers would come together to structure an organization to serve their needs . Farmers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to most was a fierce independence derived from working their land and marketing their products individually . Cooperative efforts were little understood , and a farmers ' market was in part a cooperative , in that it relied on the collective effort of everyone . But at the same time , the market was made up of individuals who would be competing against one another on market day for a limited number of customers . Although there was never any disagreement among members about the wish to make the market successful , there was little agreement over ways to define methods and objectives that everyone could support . The earliest stages of organizing were the least problematic . The Maine farmers ' markets were generally open to anyone who actually grew or produced his or her own products ? fruits , vegetables , flowers , herbs , or meat or dairy products . Some of the early markets also included craftspeople , but the mix was not a natural one , and the subsequent growth of craft markets eventually absorbed the various potters , basketmakers , and others who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a population center and drew on farms within reasonable driving distance of it ; on average , participants in the Maine markets traveled between five and fifty miles for a good location . As I have mentioned , the markets were often initiated by extension agencies , but as soon as there were visible models , they began to form when one or two farmers called on some neighbors and a few agreed to meet to sell goods in an available parking lot . It usually took at least one season of selling before the members of any group got together to define their identity , their rules , and their goals . Those of us who participated in the Androscoggin Farmers ' 64 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Market gathered for a potluck supper late in the fall of our first season . Without the tensions of trying to set up and sell , one next to the other , we were able to reflect on that first year with some humor and with critical recommendations for the next season . We decided to form an association with a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bylaws defined the terms of membership , and as Mark and I worked with other groups in drawing up these terms , we began to see some common ideas . In nearly every market that I became familiar with , members were required to produce most if not all of the items that they sold , and whatever they purchased for resale had to be Mainegrown . Many cities , including Portland and Boston and New York , already had so-called farmers ' markets that were really collections of retailers who purchased their produce from food wholesalers . The food might have been grown anywhere in the United States , or even outside the country . The newly forming farmers ' markets wanted to distinguish themselves from these food vendors At the first organizational meetings , members discussed and agreed on sites and times for selling , and specified market hours . We also had to decide on how many members any given site could support ? a decision that required each of us to assess the potential for any market , not so much in actual space but in customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first difficulties presented themselves . There was always considerable talk about how " the pie is only so big , and if we invite or allow too many members , then we 'll go home with a truckful of leftover produce . " Suggestions as to how to make the markets attractive to larger audiences were not well received , nor were suggestions about how markets could attract increasingly larger numbers of sellers and buyers . It seemed that the members were unwilling or unable to imagine that a group effort could generate more success than each of the members had previously experienced as an individual . No one talked about the whole being worth more than the sum of its parts . // If I were to characterize the prevailing attitude of these meetings , I would have to say that it was made up of timidity and fearfulness . We could communicate as a group about the difficulties of raising crops ; we could moan about how unappreciative of our fresh produce the customers were , and how city officials and merchants became less and less responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . There was an endless list of complaints , and the conversations reflected the lowest sense of collective self-esteem that I had ever witnessed . Visions were limited , and the imagination of the group was rather poor . The critically important subjects of promotion and marketing could not even be kept alive for discussion at meetings . These were areas in which individual members had little experience and no working vocabulary . Mark and I brought to the meetings some concerns and attitudes formed by our earlier political experiences , and a certain outspokenness that was particularly urban . Our aggressiveness offended some , and it is not surprising that many other members of the groups were reluctant to become engaged in the sort of discussions that I would have liked to have had . A farmers ' market was , as I saw it , a real opportunity to attract large numbers of supporters . We had the uniqueness of our physical market . We offered unusual quality and freshness in our produce . We could build the support of community members because each of us was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or city . Each of us could tell stories about our farms , our products , that would appeal to our customers . As a market , we had the task to inform our customers of our specialness , so that they would be willing to make the extra effort to do part of their shopping outside their customary supermarkets . But each time I or someone else tried to initiate a discussion about the ways in which we could promote our market , most of the other members became impatient or just silent . We were never able to create a dialogue of ideas , or a discussion of individual and group goals . 66 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE In addition , market members held conflicting opinions about product pricing and grading , and this was the source of considerable tension as the group continued to come together over a period of several seasons . Some members believed that they needed to compete only in the area of pricing . Some members were careless about grading , and they occasionally held their produce over from one market to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility of the entire market was affected by the behavior of each individual . Some members had not adopted firm policies for their farms , and depending on the pressures they felt at any given market , their tactics would change . A few felt that the members should offer only quality products to the public at all times , and that price wars were not an acceptable approach ; instead , these members relied on presentation , quality , reliability , and customer education to sell their products . I mention a few of the more relevant questions both because they were germane to the growth and development of the cooperatives and , more important , because they are the considerations behind any business . Even in the abstract , they were interesting problems that neither Mark nor I had ever addressed . Each of these questions required a kind of analytical thinking , a demand that we look critically at short- and long-range goals and at the relationship of work to its return at whatever lofty or practical level we wanted to consider . Working with other market members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its complexity . It seems very neat to list the ideas that came from our participation in farmers ' markets and to conclude that they form the basis for our business as it exists today , but it is not overstatement to say that the markets were a good training ground . They were an immediate solution to selling our produce during our first farming years . They were a forum for some shared concerns and a source of information about plants and machinery , and in these nonsensitive areas many of the members were forthcoming with help and advice . The early years of selling gave us the time // we needed to improve our land , to learn more about crops , and to gather data that we could use in developing a plan for making a livelihood from our land . Growing for specific markets was a limited demand that we could fit into our schedule . And despite the differences that arose among members of the group , we were deeply bound to one another by a shared appreciation for hard work and a real love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers ' markets had all the charm of a small country fair . These days usually came in the late summer , when the morning air was crisp and plenty of buyers were lining up for the boxes of fresh produce . As the day wore on , the temperatures would climb gradually into the high seventies or low eighties and the selling would slow down , so the afternoons became more social than commercial . Over the years , any given market would see an increase in steady customers , each of whom came to talk with one or two farmers , from whom they would do most of their purchasing and to whom they would bring stories of family activities and backyard gardening problems . Some customers would save us their grocery bags or piles of newspapers so that we could recycle them . A few even brought favorite recipes and occasional boxes of old family canning jars , which most of us continued to put to good use on our farms . Anyone who spent any time selling directly in farmers ' markets inevitably became addicted to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide us with a rather steady income from the middle of July until the end of October . One aspect that most attracted me was the opportunity to watch people use various expressions for buying and selling and develop varying styles of negotiation . Each of the farms did develop a style , or lack of style , in presenting itself . On the days when selling was good , the level of energy and conversation in the crowd was contagious . On days when produce was just beginning to be plentiful , or when there was a glut of some of the more common items , the markets could take on a mean air . Sellers ' faces and gestures betrayed their anxiety about taking 68 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE home quantities of unsold food . There were often caustic exchanges between farmers over individual decisions to drop prices , to give way to fear and , as we would say , " give the stuff away rather than bring it home to the pigs or the compost piles . " Sometimes there were open hostilities between buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Some farmers were openly willing to haggle , whereas others were clearly offended by the suggestion . During the last months of any selling season , the mornings grew increasingly cold , and setting up the trucks was a real chore . If there were rains in addition to the cold , as there are so often in the late summer and early fall , then the crowds of shoppers would thin out . Late in the season , we were all overextended on our farms , trying hard to gather in the last produce before the heavy frosts and to haul in enough wood to dry a few cords before the really cold weather came . Tempers were usually short at some of the last market days , when farmers felt less in control of their sales and less certain of their income , much of which had to be saved and meted out for living expenses during the winter and early spring months , when there was little beyond wood , animal products , and maple syrup to bring in cash . But despite the more pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality remained fascinating . Even when Mark and I had little to sell , or when we had just finished a particularly difficult week of work in Boston , neither of us would have considered missing a day of selling . Our first store-on-wheels was an old half-ton Chevy pickup , with a tired body of dark green mixed with several areas of rust . We outfitted the platform with a homemade cap built from twoby-fours and some sheets of plywood , which we painted to match the truck ( the green part , that is ) . We built movable shelves on the inside to store our produce , and over the seasons we modified the inside to accommodate just as much harvest as the half-ton springs would support . The types and varieties of truck modifications that farmers came up with would make a fascinating visual study . Some people were extremely clever in converting // a van or a pickup into a movable store . As the markets developed in strength and number across the state , the competition in truck design became more evident . The skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward . You planted , cultivated , and then harvested and packed a truck as full as possible with as great a variety of produce as you could manage . Then you got in your truck at first light and headed out carefully over bumpy country roads , trying-to avoid the roughest spots so you could get your produce safely to the market . Assuming that you did n't have a flat tire , a broken heater hose , or goods blowing out of the back of the vehicle , you arrived at the market in time to unload hundreds and hundreds of pounds of merchandise as quickly as possible . Then you tried to arrange everything into an appealing display while the inevitable handful of before-opening-hour shoppers were rifling through your best produce , handling it in ways that would have got your field hands fired . They were also peppering you with questions about the price of each and every item , long before you had had a chance to make the decisions , let alone letter the price cards that had to be affixed to each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up the scales , which had not yet been inspected by the city inspector , who was , as it happened , rounding the corner at this very moment , with his briefcase of standard weights and seals in hand . The cash box , which you thought your partner had put in the front seat of the truck , had been left at the farm , and so you rummaged around through your jacket and pants pockets to pull together enough change to get you through the first couple of sales . Your first customer inevitably handed you a twenty , and you had to rush to the farmer next to you and beg some change so that you could finish the sale . Having collected yourself ? because the first sales have a way of reassuring even the seasoned vendor that the day will not be a total failure ? you relaxed into a mode that you hoped would attract , cajole , and entertain prospective buyers into purchasing as many of your goods as possible by the end of the market . When the most hectic hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FARM IN MAINE at what had n't sold and tried to rearrange it in different containers . Perhaps the radishes would do better next to the vegetable marrows . Someone should have put the Brussels sprouts into a smaller container and placed them next to the turnips , because they did n't look appealing between the green cukes and green beans . As you were doing that , you asked yourself how many more times you could answer , " That 's an eggplant . It 's very popular in Greek and Italian cooking , and . . . " before the questioner would frown and walk on . Then , as the shoppers thinned out and disappeared altogether , you began to pack up the leftover produce , the boards , tables , bricks , and endless paraphernalia of the store , and returned to the farm , with as many empty boxes as possible and enough money to satisfy yourself that the time and effort had been justified . For those of us who continued with this for any period of time ? and the enormous effort involved caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a fascination with the process and its potential for success . Also , we felt we could evaluate this method of marketing fairly accurately , and after a year or two in any given market , we began to project the potential for income and the marketability of items . Our first efforts were based on our analysis of the data that I collected in the farm journals and notebooks that I mentioned earlier . These journals , full of years and years of data , gave us a real picture of our undertaking , including information on planting dates , seed varieties and costs , sizes of plantings , times and quantities of harvest , and the fluctuation of consumer demands at the markets . For instance , on the subject of consumer tastes , my journals remind me of our customers ' reluctance to buy fresh peas at the end of the summer . Peas were in demand on the Fourth of July , and none of us could haul enough of them to our customers on or around that date . But those of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August were often disappointed to see customers pass them by for green and yellow beans . I have also watched as a vendor had a hard // time selling everbearing raspberries because they were available for sale at what seemed a non-raspberry time . Supermarket shoppers may flock to the bins of Chilean fruit in February , but at the farmers ' markets , our customers had fixed ideas about when to expect and when to eat certain produce . Perhaps this behavior was due to the fact that many of our buyers had not been long off the family farms themselves . ( Mark informs me that it is humans ' basically conservative eating habits that have insured the survival of the species . That 's when he is speaking as an anthropologist . When he was speaking as a farmer selling ? or in this case , not selling ? his Wando peas in August , he was less theoretical . ) On our way home from each daily market , one of us would drive while the other tallied up the sales for the day . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes from that day 's sales and organized them into a list including each product 's name , the price per pound for that particular day , and the total taken in on each product . With this detailed record keeping , we could appropriate to an individual crop a relative value , based on its cost to raise and harvest and its marketability . But that was only a one-dimensional assessment , and over the first several years of direct marketing , we found that there were many other , equally important factors that affected our ability to sell our produce . From the beginning , the quality of our vegetables was of extreme importance to both Mark and me , in great part because we were so proud of our newly found ability to grow beautiful produce . We began to grade our crops very strictly , knowing full well that the eye appeal of our vegetables was as important to the consumer as the fact that they were freshly picked and grown without chemicals . In fact , for the first few years of selling , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not adopted it as a public position , and we were not trying to make a statement about it . If people asked about our methods , we told them , but our basic aim was to offer the most appealing display of as broad a variety of vegetables as we could grow . We carefully 72 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE planned the layout of our items , juxtaposing complementary colors and shapes in bins that we designed and built out of plywood and painted a warm brick red . We heeded Clarence 's advice , and our stand became increasingly popular . Early on in our marketing , we sometimes rented two stall spaces . Although we were far from the largest farm at the market , we wanted the display to seem spacious . We knew that in order to attract customers to our area , we needed to appeal to some basic impulses ? and in this case , we offered an abundant and visually pleasing choice . The abundant choice meant that we grew a large variety of crops , well beyond the popular cukes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops were eggplants , shell beans , vegetable marrows , horseradish roots , and onions , which we sold either by the pound or done up in beautiful braids . Some of these vegetables were costly to raise , but they served wonderfully as lures to get customers to stop , look , and ask questions . Even if many of these customers ended up buying a pound of string beans or three cukes for a quarter , we had the advantage of attracting a large portion of any market crowd to our display . The mode of interaction that we consciously chose to cultivate with our customers was one in which we offered information about the farm or about the food we grew , because that was the way in which we could most honestly convey our particular interests in farming . We began by writing and mimeographing small handouts on food use and preparation , especially for the less familiar crops . We talked about the nutritional value of foods , and when we began to offer herbs , we talked about the possibility of substituting herbs for salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our son was on the way . Since the gathering of information was our particular orientation in fanning , we found that sharing information was for us the most natural way to sell . Whatever the business , it seems that the seller has to evaluate the way in which he or she can reach the audience . Our approach was one of a number of methods that we observed in the group . Some farmers held on solidly to the approach of always trying // to have the earliest popular produce . Some always lowered their prices to have the least costly items , and quite a few made no effort to interact with the customers . Sometimes out of shyness , and sometimes out of indifference , farmers and their hired help would sit on the tailgates of their trucks , barely paying attention to the people who passed before their displays . My earliest selling experiences convinced me that customers are as interested in the kind of exchange that takes place between the buyer and seller as they are in the money or goods being traded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmers ' markets was due in part to the fact that consumers once again had the opportunity to purchase from an actual producer . In small towns like the ones in which we were selling , people could remember the pleasures of shopping in stores that were owned by families from their own communities , where the clerks often stayed on as employees for years . When community-owned shops were replaced by the franchises that populate nearly every shopping mall , there was a marked change in the experience of shopping . When we farmers were often back downtown , comments and complaints could once again be passed directly between buyers and sellers . In deciding what customers we were best suited to cultivate , Mark and I felt that we could not depend on the loyalty of a clientele who shopped for price alone . Those buyers were usually at the market very early in the morning , before the trucks had actually set up , or they showed up regularly when the day was nearly over , looking for farmers who were happy to take any amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back home . These customers played farmers off against one another , as they scurried from booth to booth , asking the prices and hoping to get a better verbal offer than the posted price . Farmers who tried to court this clientele had to be able to sustain a basically adversarial relationship with a fickle group . I watched over the years and saw how this eroded the pleasures of the market and embittered some sellers and buyers . 74 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE In addition , as I am fully aware , my approach to marketing in the mid-seventies was unencumbered by the fear that I would n't make enough money to get my family through the upcoming week or year . Our early attitudes about how to develop our business did n't need to be cautious , both because we were not relying on the income and because we were not in any heavy capital debt for land , labor , or machinery . Inversely , the ability to think relatively freely about the development of our farm affected our decisions in the areas of expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale and diversity . Our farming was rooted in our early pleasures of discovery and learning , and to the degree that we continue to evaluate it in those terms and try to make its goals mesh with some economic realities , we are successful . By the mid-seventies , I was rather firmly rooted in my work as the art director for The Atlantic Monthly magazine . In the fall of 1974 our son , Jacob , was born , and at the same time Mark turned away from an early career in photojournalism to begin a graduate program in medical anthropology . When I think back on all those demands on our time and energy , they seem impossible , but at the time we were not willing to give up any of our activities and were willing to work as hard as we had to to sustain all of our interests . One of the things that helped us lead our double , or perhaps triple , lives was the fact that I had negotiated with the magazine to let me work in the city for four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maine over the three-day weekend . I could read manuscripts and assign artwork in Maine just as well as in my office in Boston , so revising my schedule seemed quite reasonable . The editor of the magazine did not understand at all why anyone would want to live on a farm in Maine , or why anyone would have the nerve to expect to be given a four-day work week , and my request led to some tense negotiations . I was fully prepared to change my schedule , even if it meant looking // elsewhere for design work , but the editor eventually agreed , after he got over the shock of the request . I must also admit that he was perhaps more prescient than I and could foresee my gradual withdrawal from the city . Mark rearranged his schedule of classwork and teaching at graduate school so that he too could get to Maine for three days every week . If we had been restricted to a traditional five-day work week in one place , the simultaneous development of our farm and our professional lives would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time so that we now had a sevenday work week , but the kinds of work that we were doing were so diverse that each was an antidote for the other , both physically and intellectually . Each place also became an outrageous contradiction of the other . From Friday night until Tuesday morning , I lived and labored in a world of people who worked with their hands and their machines in and out of doors . The men I grew to know best and be fondest of had permanently stained , machine-scarred hands . They wore baseball caps or caps advertising tractors or fertilizer companies . Their blue or green heavy cotton work clothes were threadbare around the collars and cuffs . They wore construction boots summer and winter , always with white socks . They either held strong opinions against smoking or rolled their own cigarettes and were never seen without one hanging out of a corner of the mouth . Their summer tans ended at the edges of their Tshirts , and each season continued to weather skin that did n't have time to bleach out completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually halting , sometimes downright spare , but almost always uncalculating . Most of them drove around in cars or trucks with odometers on their second or third round . The women I met at the markets or on neighboring farms all knew how to run a household on a shoestring . I would meet them often when we were shopping at the Salvation Army store , looking for some work clothes for the adults or regular clothes for 76 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE the kids . Everyone cooked , canned , and froze food from the gardens to last a full year , and nearly every farm raised part or all of its meat . We women all tied our hair back in bandannas or kerchiefs when we were working in the field or selling . Many of us were plump , if not downright overweight . I 'm not certain why it always seemed to me that the women looked more tired than the men . I seldom saw what these women did to themselves when they went out on Saturday nights , but whatever personal vanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday morning until Friday evening , the scenery was quite different . I spent all of my working hours in an office in one of Boston 's lovely old brownstones , facing the Public Garden . No one had stained hands ; in fact , I had to spend a few minutes at the end of each weekend trying to repair my own hands with bleach and lemon juice and hand cream , so that I would not feel self-conscious about them in the city . There was a work uniform at the magazine , as there is among any group of people who carefully protect their status and associations by the way in which they present themselves . The publishing business seems to attract individuals who place value on casual good taste and definitely not on conspicuous trendiness , and people at the magazine wore sports coats , suits , ties , sweaters , skirts , blouses , and dresses in the unmistakably conservative Boston tradition . There were definitely no white socks and no bandannas . If the men wore hats , which they did on occasion , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had good haircuts , and were seldom plump . It was not uncommon to see an L. L. Bean catalogue on a colleague 's desk , but the work clothes that he or she ordered were seldom for working . Smoking was becoming less and less evident , as many of us gave it up and then gently chastised the few diehards to do the same . Despite the obvious visual differences between my colleagues in these two workplaces , it was their styles of communicating that were the most startlingly different . In Maine , our successes and strengths were hauled out and displayed on the market tables // each Saturday . Few felt the need to embellish the physical evidence . In publishing and academia , however , one always feels the need to display oneself verbally . It is the very essence of daily exchange , and each individual 's ability to perform well is proof of his or her worth . Style and wittiness could become so in demand that they were applauded for themselves , without regard for the substance of the discussion or ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style with the other kept me amused and stimulated , and I was addicted to both arenas . Each group had little real feeling for or understanding of the other , and each was disdainful of the values and abilities of the other . The members lived in dramatically different economic circumstances , but more important , they functioned in totally different physical environments . Probably one of the most significant factors in our decision to move to Maine was my increasing dissatisfaction with actually having to live in the city . The more that we worked outdoors at the farm , the more I found it uncomfortable to be confined to an office for many hours each day . I was very pleased with my work at the magazine , and I was deeply attached to a number of my colleagues . But I was coming to find the physical environment oppressive . The longer I lived in the city , the more I came to resent the noise , the congestion , and the anxieties of people in their cars and on the subways . I began to lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , was probably more at home in the city than in Maine at that time . He had lived most of his life in cities , first in Russia , then in Poland , and then in this country . He was somewhat receptive to the idea of a move , but was less optimistic than I was about our chances of surviving in the country . There ensued months of discussions , agreements , disagreements , and finally a joint attempt to evaluate what we might be able to do to make a living . We pieced together some rough plans , trying to work out a way to rely on income from our gardening along with income that we might be able to earn from our other 78 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE professions . By this time we were making about $2500 from our gardens . We imagined that we could surely double , if not triple , that amount if we were living in Maine full-time . And we knew that we would not be able to move for a few years , because Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began writing his dissertation . That would give us time to save a bit of money ? at least enough to get us through our first year on the farm . As the months went by and we continued to work , study , and save , Maine continued to be the place we most wanted to live . I was determined that we could make a life there that would nourish us in ways the city could not . Mark and I also felt that it was the richest environment we could offer to Jacob . Our son had spent most of his life in the city , first spending days with a nanny and then in a day-care center . Those were good experiences for him , particularly because they allowed him to have the company of other children ; for an only child , that was important . But the sensibilities that a rural life informs , I felt certain , must be experienced firsthand . There was little about the physical environment of Maine that I did not love . Our farmhouse was spacious and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited . The land around was a mixture of fields , wetlands , and small mountains . The water from the hand-dug well was clear and plentiful . Every season offered a banquet of pleasures ? not verbal ones , as many of my urban pleasures were , but sensual ones . As our attachments to Maine deepened , Mark and I talked about it less frequently with colleagues in Boston . Maine farm life does not translate well into words . In fact , Mark felt that he had to hide his interest in agriculture from other members of his graduate school department , lest he not be taken seriously as a scholar . In all truthfulness , I too edited my conversations at the magazine , choosing carefully the friends with whom I openly discussed my love of rural life . The years of preparation went rapidly , and in January 1978 I // told the magazine that I would be leaving in three months . And so , in April of that year , we packed the contents of our Beacon Street apartment into the back of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a journey that we had made every Friday evening for the past seven years of our lives . But this time we would n't be returning on Tuesday morning . 5 ? COMMITMENT To THIS DAY , I never hear the Telemann Suite for Flute and Strings without remembering our weekly trips to Boston . At seven o'clock on Tuesday mornings , " Morning Pro Musica " opened on the radio with this theme , and if we were running on schedule , it meant that we should be somewhere on the Maine Turnpike between Auburn and Gray . That would allow us to slip into Boston just after the nine o'clock jam on the Tobin Bridge and arrive at our Beacon Street apartment in time for me to shower , change , and dash to work . In the meantime , Mark would take Jacob to the day-care center and then go to the anthropology department or to one of his classes . That had been our routine for so many weeks , for so many years , that only a few notes of the Telemann piece bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was struck with more than a twinge of anxiety whenever I heard the music . As the years progressed , the anxiety was re- // placed by a rather smug amusement , and now the memory is distant and sentimental . In planning our move , we made certain to save a few thousand dollars to cushion the dramatic change in our earning ability for the first year or so . But even more important , I had contracted with a Cambridge-based political magazine , then known as Working Papers . For an annual fee of some $12,000 , I was to design the bimonthly , working primarily in Maine and traveling six times a year to Boston to do the final work on each issue before it went to the printer . We felt that for a few years , at least , we could manage on a somewhat predictable , if not spare , income We are often asked whether we were afraid to take the risk of throwing away all our urban affiliations for the uncertainties of a life in Maine . At the outset , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed whatever doubts we had , and there was very little time to reflect on what we had given up . We were simply too busy trying to work on the house , the gardens , and the wood lots . Furthermore , Mark still had several years of research to do to complete his doctorate , and we had a young son to enjoy without having to leave him for eight or nine hours each day . But there was a lot at stake . Having made a bold statement that we were willing to leave some urban accomplishments behind , we were stubbornly determined to make the change work out , for the sake of our pride if nothing else . There were many other people heading for the woods in those days , and many of them were leaving graduate programs and professions , just as we had . Some of us were more prepared than others for the realities of homesteading . Regardless of how much we were willing to scale down our consumption , there were still some basic needs that we had to meet : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transportation , basic medical care , and whatever entertainment each of us felt was essential . Any romantic notions many of us had about the simplicity or purity of life in the country were soon countered by the need to provide 82 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE at least a minimum stable income . Many people exhausted their savings within the first few years and had to look for jobs off their land , and when that happened , their idealized notions of homesteading were modified with some sobering facts of life that almost any indigenous rural person already knew firsthand . We watched as one homesteader after another in our own community looked for work in the surrounding areas . Women found it very difficult to find jobs that paid anything , and many of the men ended up working on carpentry crews . There is a bittersweet joke among many of the transplanted men in our area about having put in time as carpenters , despite backgrounds in journalism , engineering , music , or academia . Certainly Mark and I did and still do our share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it entirely while repairing and building at our own farm as the business has grown . Whatever foresight we had in making plans for some initial economic stability , however small , turned out to be one of the most important things we did . The second key to our survival was probably our emotional preparation for the work we would do here . We were thoroughly familiar with the relentless and often tedious demands of farming , and although we still held some naive notions about the pleasure of working the land , these were countered by the seven years of work we had done before we moved . We are still not fully unpacked from the move . Boxes of dishes , assorted kitchen gadgets , and books are stored in the attic . Eventually they will make their way to a thrift-store hopper , or be given away for a rummage sale . But we arrived early enough in the year to settle in superficially ? the real nesting would be done the following winter ? with the work of getting our land ready for the first full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , imagining that we had unlimited time for whatever we wanted to grow . Each day we tackled part of a new plot east of the house , clearing out a small area so we could break in the soil with a crop of potatoes . We designed new perennial // beds and plantings around the farmhouse . We created a large lawn on the western slope behind the house and transplanted a couple of small maples , completing the circle of trees around the farmhouse . We ordered seeds of vegetables we had not yet tried , such as soy , lima , kidney , soldier , and pea beans and different varieties of chard , spinach , and eggplant . We began to plant more varieties of herbs . We ordered and set out some two hundred gladiolus bulbs , along with tubers of cactus and standard-blooming dahlias . ( The burden of digging , curing , and storing those flowers ' corms and tubers haunted us for several years , until we finally agreed that we truly disliked glads and the dahlias were more work than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was endless , exhilarating , and we both watched our bodies grow stronger and actually change in proportion . Carrying , bending , digging , lifting , hoeing , weeding ? and my legs , shoulders , and forearms became heavily muscled and strong . In fact , I had never felt in better shape physically , except for my back , which ached at the end of every day . As it turned out , Mark 's most vulnerable parts were his feet , and many a night he still comes in from work and fills a pail with warm soapy water to soak them in . I clearly recall collapsing into bed each night , satisfied that we had done so much around the farm and grateful for a good mattress and the deep sleep that follows real physical exertion . During the next three years , our work , experimentation , and marketing efforts did begin to produce significant increases in the income we were generating from our farm . With only a slight increase in land under cultivation , our gross farm income climbed quickly from less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 . A great deal of that increase could be attributed to the fact that we were farming full-time , but we were also planting our gardens differently , choosing our crops in different proportions , looking for new markets , and working to promote the visibility of our farm , in the hope that we could gradually wean ourselves from our urban income . 84 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE We focused our attention first on plants and growing methods . Since we had begun with so little horticultural knowledge , we had chosen our crops on the advice of other farmers and added to the selection with some whimsical choices of seeds and plants offered through the various seed catalogues . It took years of growing and selling experience before we could begin to make some considered decisions about what to grow and how to grow it . From that experience , I can offer a few observations . Magazines such as Horticulture , Pacific Horticulture , and Organic Gardening will provide the beginner with the names and addresses of a number of the better-known seed companies and nurseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are searching for specific suppliers , a valuable source book was published in 1986 by Barbara Barton ; it is called Gardening by Mail . Barton , a former reference librarian , has compiled an extensive list of seed companies and nurseries , garden supply companies , horticultural societies , useful gardening books , horticultural libraries , and horticultural magazines and newsletters . Seed and plant catalogues make any number of claims for their offerings , including details about earliness and quantity of yield , hardiness , disease resistance , eye appeal , and taste . Seed companies also make varied efforts to comment on how the plants will perform in different geographical locations . As it became increasingly important to us to have reliable crops , we narrowed our choices of catalogues to those that seemed to give thorough horticultural information . There is usually a direct correlation between a company 's reliability and the lack of hyperbole it uses in making claims for its products . Ideally , companies should offer customers the following in-formation : ? Both common and botanical names of the plants . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some trees , shrubs , herbs , and flowers . ? Information on the amount of seeds in a package or the number // of seeds in the amount ( an ounce , usually ) that you will be able to order . You will be amazed to find that well-known companies do not tell you how much you are buying . ? The germination rates of given seeds . You may need only ten seeds of something that has a ninety-percent germination rate , but you will need one hundred seeds of something with a germination rate of nine percent . ? A brief but accurate description of the soil and temperature conditions for optimum germination and growth . ? The approximate number of days from seeding to flower and fruit harvest . ? The hardiness of the plant in different climate zones . ? The resistance of the plant to the most common and difficult diseases or insect pests . When buying seeds and plants , you are also well advised that many seed companies have both wholesale and retail catalogues , and unless you ask specifically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing this , we ordered for several years from the retail listings , when in many cases we were ordering amounts large enough to qualify us as wholesale buyers . In addition , there is always the possibility of group purchases , which we sometimes attempted with other members of the farmers ' markets . But even if you find that you are purchasing primarily from wholesale catalogues , you might want to study the retail listings as well . The wholesale offerings are usually restricted to the most popular plant species and varieties , and you may find that you want to include more unusual plants in your gardens . It was not until we had farmed for a number of years that we realized that seed companies function in a number of different ways . There are companies that raise , harvest , cure , and package all of their own seeds . There are companies that have no agricultural facilities or experience , and that purchase all of their seeds from growers throughout the world . In between these two extremes are the majority of companies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . As we 86 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE have developed special-interest areas at the farm , we have occasionally found it helpful to write or call seed companies to ask whether they can give us additional information from the field tests they have conducted on individual crops . Reputable companies ? both small and large ? should be willing to answer questions or direct you to sources of further information . When ordering seeds , you should also know which kinds will keep for a year or two , in case you overorder ( a tendency that we are still trying to curb ) . Some seeds , such as cole crops and onions , can be stored in a cool , dry place , and their germination rate will not decrease much over a period of two to three years . Others , such as beets and parsnips , are not worth storing for even a year after purchase . Since seed prices have risen sharply during the past decade , it is no small economy to purchase carefully . You might also want to consider whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you will have little or no success in saving your own garden seeds , whereas nonhybrid varieties produce seeds that you can collect and use . We have begun to collect and save increasing amounts of our herb and flower seeds , especially when we find colors and plant qualities that we want to propagate . As our skills with seed collection and storage increase , we are finding that our seeds are often more vigorous than their commercially produced counterparts . Even if you are a weekend gardener , I would encourage you to try collecting some seeds from your own garden for the experience alone . It will press you into looking more closely at your plants when they are at the end of their production cycle , past their visual prime . You might be intrigued by the beauty of seed pods and the fascinating differences in seed shapes , sizes , and yield . In addition to choosing your seeds and plants from companies you feel are reputable , you may also want to shop around for the best prices , especially if you are ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , as we are now doing . Every first and second week of January , we spread out dozens of catalogues on our kitchen table , list the seeds we need , and compare // information and prices . We order from wherever we feel we will get the best quality , price , and reliable delivery . Over the past decade we have seen greater standardization of pricing in the seed and plant industry , but there are still enough inconsistencies to make shopping around worthwhile . When purchasing seeds for the crops from which we expect large cash yields , we take yet another precaution , by ordering seeds from several suppliers so we have some insurance in the event of a crop failure or mishandling of seeds . This can save a lot of money and anguish . For instance , I spoke recently with a commercial flower grower from Indiana who had ordered a specific color of Limonium , or statice as it is commonly known , from a reliable company , and the crop turned out to be a different color ? a color that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were counting on every penny from our vegetable garden , we ended up with 150 hills of yellow pattypan squash where we thought we had sown blue Hubbard . When this happens ? and it is not infrequent ? the seed company usually issues an apology and replaces the seed at no cost , but that does little to offset losses for a commercial grower . We used seeds carelessly in our first gardens . We often threw handfuls along a furrow , or dropped them into place with the corn and bean planter . If the seeds were planted too closely , then we had to thin the rows by hand . If they were too far apart , we would reseed , time permitting , or cultivate the space to prevent large weeds . There was no predictable relation between seed use and yield from one year to the next . Also , we had been taught to plant crops in long , narrow , ribbonlike rows , with enough space between each row to drive a horse , tractor , or tiller . That meant that the proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heavily weighted in favor of uncultivated space . We have since learned that many crops are best planted in wide rows , and once you rethink a garden with this design , you immediately change the productive area and greatly reduce the spaces to be cultivated . We have probably 88 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE experimented with every permutation that one can imagine in laying out our gardens , and as of this writing , we have settled on a method that results in the highest yields of first-quality produce All of the rows in our annual gardens and most in our perennial gardens are planted on raised beds , which we shape with the hillers of the tractor and then manually smooth over with iron rakes . ( The job of smoothing could be done with the tractor too , if we fashioned a rake to be hauled on the work bar of the machine , so that the hillers pile up the soil and the rake follows . ) We thus have a series of rows two to three feet wide by perhaps six to eight inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , main garden . We then cover the raised rows with four-foot-wide black plastic mulch . You can get machines that lay plastic mulch , but having worked both ways , we have chosen to do our mulching by hand . This means that two people actually carry and stretch the rolls of plastic over the raised beds , while a third hoes dirt into piles every five or six feet along both edges . When the row is covered , someone drives over it with the tractor , keeping the wheels of the machine just outside the plastic and steering the potato hillers so they draw soil in to bury the edges of the plastic completely . Any loose edges of plastic can be caught by the wind and torn free from the fields . It is also important to draw the plastic tightly over the width of the row , so the wind can not reach down through the planting holes and turn your whole raised row into a giant sail . You do not have to coordinate the mulching of the field with the planting , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , when the soil is still moist . We made the mistake of putting down plastic over a dry section of the field one year , and had to contend with a desert under the mulch and with plants that struggled all summer simply to survive . As soon as the plastic is laid over the raised rows , we cover the walkways between the rows , first with several layers of paper and then with a hay mulch . This allows the rain to penetrate the field at the same time that it suppresses weeds . The paper- and // hay-covered walkways also provide a clean and comfortable path for general maintenance and harvesting . When we began using this kind of cover , we bought and used discarded newspaper from the local dump . It did the job , but it was tedious and sometimes difficult to put down , especially if it was windy . Trying to solve that problem led us to use the butt ends of printing paper ? leftover rolls of paper from large printing presses , such as those that print magazines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost from area printers , who typically have to dispose of them anyway . We found a printer who was actually delighted to see the paper put to some good use . He had built his company with the same frugality that causes Mark and me to fabricate and scrounge whenever possible . It has taken us more than a dozen years to get to this method of planting , and during that time we have attempted to plant and cultivate with tractors , tillers , and hours of hoeing . Since we chose to farm organically , we built up our soil over the years with tons of animal manure , lime , and compost . In the process , we created a wonderful place not only for crops but for luxurious amounts of pigweed , galinsoga , chickweed , and amaranth , some of which came to us with the animal manure . We tried to cultivate the gardens each year , before we used our mulching technique , and inevitably lost ground with one or another crop , usually the small-seeded kinds such as carrots , beets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the weeds . When we first started using the complete mulching system , we assumed that we could set into the plastic only the more traditional transplants such as tomatoes , peppers , tole crops , and the like . Now we put almost no seeds directly into our gardens . Everything is set out as transplants , including beets , onions , peas , beans , turnips , chard , dill , chamomile , cucumbers , squashes , and gourds . We jokingly refer to our fields as our instant gardens , because immediately after planting they are a tapestry of vegetables , herbs , and flowers , all set out as young , hardened-off plants . The results have been impressive . During March , April , and May , we sow specific numbers of 90 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE these crops in the greenhouses or cold frames , timing them so that the transplants are ready to go into the field whenever the nighttime temperatures permit . We transplant our field seedlings into large commercial plugs , fifty plugs to a tray . This allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we transplant from the plugs to the ground , the individual root balls are not disturbed . Regardless of the vagaries of the spring weather , the seeds are germinated and grown to a specific stage under controlled conditions . We harden off the seedlings and always wait for a cloudy day or a series of rainy days to transplant into the field . Depending on the size of the plant , we make a hole in the plastic over each raised row just large enough to work through . Ideally , the plastic should fit snugly around the stem of the plant , but we have to provide working space for our fingers and enough room for the root ball of the seedling . We work carefully not to rip the plastic , because anyplace where sunlight and water come into contact with bare soil is ground in which weed seeds can germinate . About two to three weeks after the young seedlings are set out , we have to go over each and every row , replacing the few plants that have been destroyed by cutworms , wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out whatever weeds there are . But after that first repairing , the seedlings are usually large enough to crowd out any further weed growth , and they are generally strong enough to withstand weather fluctuations and other stresses . Although the labor of mulching and planting is uncommonly demanding in the early part of the season , we have found that we use less seed , have a very high ratio of plants that live to harvest , and are freed from the overwhelming tedium of maintenance and the frustration of giving up parts of our gardens to weeds . Hardy transplants also show a greater tolerance of stresses in weather and early insect damage . In some ways , this method is simply a reallocation of labor : we spend more time with young plants in the greenhouses than in the fields , and planting is usually a several-week rather than a several-day operation . But once // we have finished these tasks , we have eliminated the weeks and weeks of labor that we initially spent on weeding , thinning , and constant cultivation . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic-covered rows , by making small holes and seeding where we want the plants to emerge . The results have been uneven . Our potatoes responded very well . We used a bulb planter with a long handle to cut deep holes into the raised rows , and then dropped cut-up pieces of seed potatoes into the holes and filled them with dirt . The plants sprouted quickly in the warm , moist soil , and the potatoes never needed the weeding and hilling that our traditionally planted acreage had required . We had less success with some beans that we seeded into holes in the mulch . Some young cotyledons appeared , but a large number either dried out or rotted because of uneven soil conditions or the lack of good air circulation just beneath the plastic . We need to repeat these efforts several more seasons before I can rule out their chances for success . We also need to find a way to grow carrots in plastic-covered beds , because they can become quite misshapen when transplanted . Despite these few problems with the method , I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard gardening , particularly for those whose working schedules keep them from cultivating their gardens as frequently as they should . I 've talked with many people who say that they gave up their kitchen gardens because they did n't want to use sprays and they simply could not keep up with the weeding . My main objection to the whole process really rests on the wide-scale use of black plastic , both because it is aesthetically unpleasing and because it is not a recyclable material . But I think that we are a short time away from the development of a plantbased mulch that will do the same work as the plastic , and we will be able to disc that back into the soil as a beneficial additive . I read just recently that a patent is being sought for a biodegradahle mulch that looks and behaves like black plastic but that is 92 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE made from a corn starch . Whether or not this discovery becomes a manufactured and affordable item really depends on our attitudes as consumers . Needless to say , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeding and planting techniques was paralleled by our experimentation with a variety of greenhouses and cold frames , starting with the primitive arrangements that I described earlier . Just before leaving Boston , we decided to give ourselves a last luxurious present , knowing that for a number of years we would not be able to indulge ourselves as consumers . We looked at the various greenhouses that were then on the market . We were primarily interested in glass and aluminum structures that could be permanently attached to the farmhouse , and ended up choosing a beautiful ten-by-thirty-foot model that cost about $3000 . The carefully packaged greenhouse parts arrived by truck sometime during our first Maine summer . We were so preoccupied with the gardens that we simply stored the boxes until the harvest was nearly completed . Then we began construction along the southeast side of the farmhouse . We hired a backhoe to dig a trench for the concrete footing and the foundation , which we built ourselves from cement blocks . It took us about two months to finish the masonry , erect the aluminum framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using bricks we had saved from the dismantled chimneys . The greenhouse was very beautiful . It was also very inefficient . We had chosen it uncritically from the standpoint of its function , having been won over completely by its visual design . That first winter we had no plans to use the space , and so we closed it off from the main part of the house , but early the next spring we opened the double glass doors that led out from the kitchen , in the hopes of starting our seedlings in a place with appropriate light , ventilation , and humidity . When the days were sunny , the greenhouse was lovely , but during gray spells and after sunset , it lost large amounts of heat to the outside . We had not anticipated the heat loss through a single layer of ordinary glass , // so our first job was to try to correct the structure 's design . We cut long thin strips of wood and attached them to the insides of the aluminum supports , and then we stapled on clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This reduced the heat loss substantially , but it also ruined the beauty of the design . Another thing that we learned the hard way was the fact that we can always buy , cut , and replace any of the flat pieces of glass that might break in the greenhouse , but when the graceful pieces of curved glass break , we are obliged to return to the manufacturer for new ones . Positioned as it is beneath a valley that runs from the front cape to the attached ell of the farmhouse , the greenhouse has several times been broken by ice falling off the roof . Using what we learned from that first prefabricated greenhouse and from our first simple pole-and-plastic shelters , we have gone on to design a number of structures , some permanent and some temporary , in which to grow seedlings . The designs always evolve from some critical flaws in our previous attempts , but I think that we have settled on a few ideas that are sound . Whether the structure is aluminum or wooden , any greenhouse should be glazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat loss is reduced . Glass may be the most pleasing option , but there are also different fiberglass materials and greenhouse plastics that will function well . Freestanding greenhouses do not have to be transparent on all sides , and in harsh climates , where energy is most costly , it is advisable to position the greenhouse facing south , with the north wall closed and insulated . For our wooden structures , we have tried to locate cedar , which can be milled into lumber with dimensional strength for the framework and also into one-inch boards from which we make plant tables ( which we cover with wooden strips or hardware cloth ) . Cedar can withstand the constant humidity of a greenhouse without having to be treated with wood preservatives . All of our greenhouses are heated with wood-burning stoves or furnaces . This has seemed the most economical choice , but 94 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE it does mean that during exceptionally cold nights in March and sometimes in April , we have to rouse ourselves out of a warm bed to trudge out to stoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems that can take over if the weather gets very cold , and we are considering putting in some small oil heaters to relieve us from those midnight rounds . Whether you heat with wood or another system , it is necessary to assess how big the unit should be , and fans are always a necessity for good air circulation Large containers of water will do a lot of work in storing daytime heat . I recall building our first solar greenhouse and moving plants in on the same day that we finished setting up the stove . The greenhouse measured sixteen by thirty-two feet , and with the cold , windy March night , we were just able to keep the plants from freezing until the next day , when we moved in a half-dozen fifty-five-gallon drums filled with water . The water heated up during the day and slowly released its warmth at night . In addition , we have tried suspending barrels of water on iron cradles over the woodstoves , so that the water was heated at night by the fire and we had warm water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used to water our plants . If you are a backyard gardener , it is likely that you will first be seduced into thinking about a greenhouse by any one of a number of ads that appear constantly in the glossy magazines . By all means consider these , but at the same time check the yellow pages of any large city directory to find a greenhouse supplier , and go look at the things that it offers its customers , who are almost exclusively commercial growers . In addition , do some research in your local library , because there are endless numbers of articles on greenhouse designs , including everything from those that you can buy prefabricated to those that you can build completely on your own . We did not go about building our greenhouses this methodically , and we made some costly mistakes Our greenhouse space is complemented by a number of cold // frames . Some are freestanding , and we use them for perennials and annuals once the nighttime temperatures are acceptable . Then there are those we call our heat-assisted cold frames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold frames are structured like any others , except that their back wall is the bottom front wall of the greenhouse . We set two to three windows into this wall and fasten a small fan on a thermostatic control facing into the cold-frame area . During the cold weather , we leave the covers on the frames , and during the coldest nights the thermostat activates the fan to draw heat out of the greenhouse and circulate it throughout the cold frame . ( This notion is easily adaptable to most homes , since the cold frame can be placed on the south side of the house against a basement window , with a similar thermostat and fan . ) This kind of cold frame is a halfway house , if you will , between the full protection of the greenhouse and the final hardening-off temperatures of the regular cold frames . These environments allow us to move plants out of the **25;120;TOOLONG greenhouses much sooner , and the gradual move from germination to hardening off and field transplanting gives us uncommonly hardy and healthy stock . For the greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we transplant all our seedlings , we have decided that heat mats are essential on all the germinating benches . The initial costs of these mats are more than offset by the money we do not have to spend to keep the greenhouse temperature so high . Germinating seeds need not so much a high ambient air temperature as a consistently warm soil temperature . With heat mats under the flats , we can adjust and maintain a steady soil temperature so that germination is faster and more even , and the vigorous initial growth produces plants that are hardy and less susceptible to disease and insect damage . Home growers will probably have the best luck with starting their own plants over heat mats and in cold frames , if they can curb their impulse to seed too early in the spring ; the most common error I hear about from home growers is that they simply can not wait to plant something , so 96 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE they inevitably end up with leggy , malnourished seedlings that struggle to survive in the inadequate light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to produce healthy plants and large garden yields are based on some information that we digested years ago from our reading . A seed , once germinated , struggles to grow steadily into plant , flower , and fruit in an attempt to produce another seed and thus insure its survival . Every effort that can be made to assist that process and to guarantee smooth and continuous growth will result in the healthiest and most vigorous individuals . Whatever is done by nature or by intent to intervene in that process will have some effect on the eventual success of the plant . To understand this helps to explain why all of us have purchased healthy-looking seedlings from a garden center and then , when these seedlings have n't produced well , said that we simply do n't have green thumbs . The reasons people fail with plants may be their own mistakes . It may also be that these plants have already been stressed and manipulated by previous growers . There are many ways of delaying and stimulating plant growth through the use of light , temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look healthy and well formed when they go on sale , but their ability to flower and fruit can be significantly affected by their early growing conditions . If the variety is not truly adaptable to the region you live in , the external appearance of the seedling will tell you nothing about its ability to succeed . These are just a few of the reasons we began and continue to try to understand the biological requirements of each seed and plant . It is also why we choose to grow our own seedlings , because our income is tied to getting maximum performance from our crops . If you do n't grow your own garden stock , you need to know something about the methods used to produce these plants . At the same time that we were developing gardening methods and working with planting techniques , we had to begin to educate // ourselves in the purchase and use of farm machinery . The first thing we bought was a small Farmall tractor , manufactured sometime in the early forties . A farmer in one of the neighboring towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators , and mowing machine , for $ 1200 . When the machine was delivered , we spread the attachments out on the side lawn and struggled to figure out what the different bent and curved pieces of metal were for . It 's amusing to think back on those times , and it helps to explain why I now take pride in recognizing machines sitting around other farmyards . I 'm pleased with the literacy I have developed with plants , machines , and the jargon of farming . Initially , it was quite a thrill to own our own tractor . We could plough , harrow , and cultivate when we wanted the work done , and were not dependent on the availability of hired help . But beyond the practical advantages , there was the basic pleasure of learning to drive and operate large equipment . Now we were able to cut over small pieces of a new field and pull stumps out with chains attached to the work bar of the tractor . We could move some stones out of garden space and repair damaged stone walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skid wood from land that was not too hilly . We fabricated homemade trailers to haul behind it and used them to carry wood , tools , large quantities of plants , and produce . The next significant piece of equipment that we purchased was a garden tiller , for working smaller areas of land and for cultivating parts of the field . We also bought a single-row potato digger , which we used for two seasons before we decided that we would not continue to raise large potato crops ; so we sold the digger . It was probably inevitable that we would next need our own welder , not just to repair the machinery that we had but also to design and build farm implements . Each of the new machines allowed us to do an enormous amount of work , and it is easy to see how people can be beguiled into thinking that newer , bigger , more sophisticated tools are essential . Mark and I have stood 98 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE gaping at the equipment on display at the annual agricultural trade shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that . But in most cases the machinery has been too big for the parcels of land that we cultivate , and is really not suited to the goals of our farm . We have also come to realize that most large machinery is used to perform specific tasks either on an irregular basis or once a year , at most . We have had to have stumps and stones bulldozed on occasion . We have had to move piles of wood with the use of a cherry picker ? the crane mounted on the top of a pulp truck . We have had to reroute a part of a road into our farm , and we have had to hire a backhoe to dig trenches for water pipes and septic systems for new farm buildings . Each spring we need to spread many tons of manure and lime onto the gardens and pastures . And whenever we clear out and turn over a new piece for cultivation , we must either plough and harrow repeatedly with our small Farmall or hire a large tractor and tiller to chew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial cover crop . Often it has been attractive to think that by owning a fairly large assortment of machinery , we would be able to accomplish much more work , in addition to having the flexibility to do the work whenever we choose . But the other side of that capability is the need to purchase , house , maintain , and operate the machinery ourselves . After more than a decade of owning , renting , and borrowing sizable machinery , we have revised some of our original thinking about machines . We still have the tractor , the tiller , the welder , and a four-wheel-drive pickup ? machines that we use repeatedly each season . It is unlikely that we will add to that equipment with anything more than a small bucket loader for the tractor . Our lime is spread by the company from which we purchase it . Our bulldozing and large tractor work is done by farmers or contractors in the area . Whenever possible , we exchange the use of machinery for our own work ; for instance , we grow a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large tractor and manure spreader once each season . // Over the years , my thrill with using large machines has drastically decreased . Given the choice , I would work with my hands and stand or walk for days on end before spending a day in the seat of a machine . I have grown to dislike the noise of engines , which drowns out the sounds of the wind , insects , and birds . I resent the smell of exhaust , which overshadows the marvelous fragrances of the earth and plants . One year we borrowed a very up-to-date field transplanting machine , thinking that if it worked out well , we might consider buying our own . I spent days bumping along in a metal chair , feeding seedlings into rotating rubber grippers that in turn moved the plants down and into the ground . It was miserable . I felt very uncomfortable being distanced from the small plants , and wanted to tuck each one into the earth myself . When we had finished planting with the machine , I still felt the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planting and tamp the soil firmly around the stem . So if I can calculate that I will be able to do the same amount of work manually as with a machine , I will choose the former , both because it is more aesthetically pleasing for me and because the physical work of farming keeps my body in shape . Mark has also grown less eager to spend time on the machinery . We still have to do routine maintenance , but there is usually a willing newcomer who is happy to climb into the seat of the Farmall for a day of plowing or harrowing , and we are only too ready to accept . The attitudes that one develops about working with machinery are probably more important than I would have imagined , and in our case they have profoundly affected the kind of farm we are developing . The fact that we continue to farm more intensively on a smaller and smaller scale is a response to the ways in which we prefer to work . Five years ago , we thought that all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our needs . Now we are using some of the land for pasture and for rotating our crops . We have adequate space for green manuring and soil building . The business is growing larger , but that is because we are scaling down and expanding the products from our crops . I00 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE The largest sum of money that we have ever spent on a single piece of equipment went for something that has to be kept as far away from dirt as possible . It also does more work for us than any other tool on the farm . We use the computer daily now for any number of farm-related tasks : for writing books , catalogues , and articles ; for record keeping ; and for analyzing data on ordering , planting , harvesting , selling , payroll , and taxes . The computer surprised me ; I was reluctant even to consider buying it , and more reluctant still to sit down and confront it . I was less intimidated by the prospect of learning to assemble the implements of the tractor than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tools , if appropriate to the tasks , the computer soon became familiar and indispensable . The need to educate ourselves about plants , farming methods , and equipment was a response to taking the problem of making a living off the land more and more seriously . I have no doubt that we will continue to learn and to revise our thinking in each of these areas . They are simply the prerequisites for surviving . But the most important thing that we had to confront and begin to understand was the area of marketing . In fact , early on in our farming , we never even used the word marketing . We simply sold our produce . By the summer of 1978 we were taking our vegetables and seedlings to markets in Auburn , Lewiston , Rumford , and Portland . Since the Lewiston and Portland markets both took place on Saturday , Mark took one truck and I took another , borrowed from my parents , and we each set off early in the morning . We usually sold the better part of our vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pack , set up , repack , and drive was tremendous . On the days when we brought back hundreds and hundreds of dollars , we were able to justify the effort , but on days when the weather was too rainy , too cold , or too hot , we had to expend the same amount of work for customers who did n't show up to buy . COMMITMENT IOI From the money we made and saved that first summer and fall , we had to apportion funds to carry us over until the next season . The first winter was a real test of our commitment . We were determined to use little or no oil for heating , but we did not find time to cut or haul any wood until December , after we finished building the glass greenhouse . That meant that we . spent many days hauling in green wood through increasingly deep snow , first with the tractor , then with the truck , and finally with toboggans . The farmhouse was uninsulated , except for the kitchen , which we rebuilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . During the coldest spells , frost appeared on some of the north-facing inside walls . Still , we were determined not to use any oil , and anyway we had very little money to use for fuel . We set up four small old wood-burning stoves , collected from auctions and barn sales , and we spent hours every day stoking stoves , carrying wood to both floors of the farmhouse , and carrying and cleaning ashes and wood chips . At no expense to our cash reserve but at great expense to our time and energy , we kept warm enough , but after one winter we resolved never again to heat our house with a series of small stoves . The next season we purchased a wood-burning furnace , and Mark installed it himself , using the existing ductwork from the central oil burner . At the base of the decision to save up enough money to purchase and use a wood-burning furnace , which cost $2000 , was the whole question of what goods and materials we needed to free us up for other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn to purchase those goods . It 's a delicate balancing act , managing work in order to purchase , and doing without for the sake of having time . We had such a limited income that first winter that we had to budget every expense , right down to how many gallons of milk we bought in a given week . We decided to make all of the gifts we gave during the holiday season , so we went to a nearby tannery and bought leather skins , from which we designed belts , vests , and a briefcase . We gave presents from our pantry of jams and IO2 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE jellies , pickles and relishes . I really did not feel that we were sacrificing , despite our lack of money , but I did begin to take more seriously the fact that we had to make a minimum amount of money from the crops , and that each year there would be endless uncontrollable variables that could affect our income . In short , no one was taking care of us anymore . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed paycheck , no medical care , no expense accounts , and , not least of all , no status . We watched our vegetable yields increase , but even when we worked out that we could produce more than $5000 worth of mixed crops per acre , there was a limit to the acreage two of us could manage and to the efforts that we could sustain . At best , we could count on a respectable income from late June until late October , but with the increasing costs of seed , gasoline , and machinery maintenance , along with general living expenses , we needed to find other ways to bring in money from work on the farm . The alternative was to settle on the realization that we would always have to have outside work to support ourselves . I am not certain which of these influences played the strongest part in our drive to make the farm the major focus of our work , but both the wish to free ourselves from having to work for others and the wish to define some series of endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a degree of solvency , played a part . Only a short time out of the city , we began to articulate the challenge as we saw it and to invest ourselves even more seriously in defining a life that was focused entirely on horticulture . This much was becoming clear : farming for a living can not be done casually in this climate . The season is too short , the soil is too tired , and the markets are too far away . We were going to have to analyze and apply whatever information or imaginative thinking we could find to give us a chance to continue . 6 ? FULL-TIME FARMERS LAST EVENING Roger , Pam , Ann , Mark , and I gathered in the summer room of the farmhouse for dinner . There was one other guest , but Bob had never worked at Hedgehog Hill , so he was an onlooker , or perhaps our audience , for the several hours of reminiscing . The memories were sometimes tender , sometimes painful , and , as the evening wore on , increasingly hilarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing to relive some and , I 'm certain , remembering but choosing not to talk about others . At one point in the evening , I turned to Ann and asked her if she had ever imagined that we would sit around like this , talking and laughing about our years of working together . She replied that yes , she had known we would , but she had been uncertain how long it would take to get to that point . For Roger , Mark , and me , it had been a long time , because Roger was our first full-time employee at Hedgehog Hill . It has now been four I04 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE years since Roger left the farm to become a manager for one of the Maine Arby 's restaurant franchises , and it has been eight years since we first met him . In the spring of 1979 , Mark and I were looking for someone to cut and clear the wood from a badly overgrown field that lay southeast of the farmhouse . We asked around our neighborhood to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , in exchange for either wood or pay . Roger Crockett , the son-in-law of one of our neighbors , came by to inquire about the work . Our first meeting was somewhat uncomfortable . We had not really anticipated hiring another adult to work full-time on the farm . We had not thought through our expectations about work or about money . The discussion was a kind of exchange of ideas between us and Roger , and each was cautiously trying to get a sense of the other . Roger was very guarded with us at first , and we later learned that he saw the differences in our backgrounds as real barriers to our understanding and appreciation of each other . He was born and raised in this area and had traveled out of Maine infrequently . He and his family were members of the local evangelical church , and his political and social attitudes were at the time strictly formed by his wish to be associated with the church 's conservative doctrine . He had recently left a job selling ax handles manufactured by a local company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support himself , his wife , and their three children . Roger 's impressions of us were formed primarily from the local gossip , which we learned from him years later . It seems that Mark and I were commonly referred to as the foreigners , or the hippies from the city who had come to farm . We were said to be unorthodox , politically radical , and most of all different . According to rumor , we also had quite a bit of money , because everyone knew you could n't farm for a living in Maine , especially with an organic vegetable farm . Despite our apparent differences , the three of us muddled through a kind of mutual interview , and Roger agreed to take on the work FULL-TIME FARMERS Ios of clearing for an hourly wage . The area that he had to cut and clear covered about six sloping acres . That section of the farm had once been used for corn and bean production , and the land still bore the scars of continuous plowing and soil erosion . Whoever had discontinued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple trees , but this too had been ignored long enough for invading poplars to grow thirty to forty feet tall and for some of the white birches to measure a foot in diameter . There was also an unsightly growth of scrub pine , alders , brambles , and gray birch . All in all , it was the kind of cutting that left you with a sizable portion of brush and lesser amounts of usable wood . Roger began work in April . We watched him come and go each day , carrying his chain saw , gas cans , and lunch box across the back lawn and up into the field . We heard him nearly all day ; the saw quieted down only when he was stacking logs or piling brush . As the weeks passed , we tried to get him to join us for lunch , but he was reluctant to come down off the land . Little by little , though , the field began to take form , and so did our acquaintance . In three months Roger completely cleared the whole parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and piled the brush in long narrow rows for burning . It was an impressive piece of clearing , carefully done by someone who obviously took great pride in his work . I do n't remember when Roger first agreed to have lunch with us , but gradually during those three months we began to break from work and sit out on the lawn or in the kitchen to eat and talk together . Initially we spoke mainly of the work he was doing , of the weather , of the projects that Mark and I were working on . Gradually , as we felt more comfortable with each other , we talked about our backgrounds , our past jobs and families , our plans , and the coincidence of our having left the city and his having left a steady job for what each of us hoped would be a more interesting way of making a living . Our opportunities to watch each other work , to talk about and share some common ideas and goals , Io6 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE began to overshadow the differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our getting acquainted was strongly based on our shared belief in hard work , on our pride in the quality of that work , and on our similar hopes for carving out new lives not totally defined by nine-to-five institutions . By the time Roger finished the cutting , Mark and I had decided to ask him whether he would be interested in staying on for as many months as possible to work with us in the fields . At that point , neither Mark nor I was certain how much labor we could afford , or how interested we were in a full-time commitment . Roger too was not interested in taking on a full-time job , but he liked the idea of working for a few months and then having the winter to find jobs with some of the woodsmen in the area . Prior to Roger 's arrival , Mark and I had solved our labor needs with an extraordinary amount of help from my parents . Although my parents have always wondered why we wanted to give up the life we had in the city to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts with many hours of help . Before we moved permanently to Maine , my mother drove to the farm every Friday to supervise the picking of some of the vegetables for the weekend farmers ' markets ( we hired a few young people to work in the fields when the crops needed harvesting ) . My parents also farm-sat at critical times during the season . When we left seedlings unattended during our work week in the city , they checked on the watering and put blankets and cloches over tender seedlings or field transplants if frosts threatened . Perhaps because of these many hours of volunteer help , we still saw our operation as a family farm ? a small and private undertaking . After our first season of trying to raise crops for farmers ' markets on a full-time basis , Mark and I considered hiring another person , but the transition from having a private family farm to having a real employee was a big step . Hiring Roger for a specific task , which gave us the chance to get used to having another person working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change . In fact , when Roger came to cut the wood , we had no // notion of asking him to stay on . We watched him work , and he watched us work . The decision to ask him to join us grew naturally out of a trial period . I never would have believed that another worker could make such a difference to the productivity of a place . Simple mathematics says that one added to two should increase the output by fifty percent . But the three of us as a team could easily do twice as much planting , tilling , hoeing , harvesting , building , cutting , and selling . It was not just the simple fact that there was another body to work ; it was the difference that another person , particularly a person from outside the family , made in a workplace that had been up to that time a personal one . After Roger joined us , we were no longer a family farm . When decisions had to be made about planting , work schedules , machinery use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a couple but a small group of workers . Mark and I could no longer conduct our days in accordance with our personal whims and habits ; we had to organize our work to accommodate the presence of another person . In every sense , we were no longer just a couple who were farming , and we had to begin to examine the ways in which our personal dynamics affected the workplace of another person . The hiring of a third person was one of the most significant changes we made in our country work . Furthermore , it gave us a different economic responsibility , one we only began to appreciate after the first year or so , as our commitment to Roger grew and our dependence on one another increased . When times were tight and income diminished , we needed to hang on to a certain amount of money to pay Roger . When the income was increased by midseason vegetable sales , we needed to squirrel away enough money to have on hand for ourselves and for Roger 's wages . Roger also came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer a matter of Mark and me and Jacob living frugally , with the insurance of other professions to back us up if the farm did n't work out . We had undertaken the responsibility of caring for another family , and at least in part we began to think about the Io8 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE ways in which we could insure a regular income throughout the year . This realization that our farm had changed from a personal enterprise to a small business was not in the least burdensome , because the responsibilities were constantly offset by the amazing increase in our collective productivity . That first summer the three of us , still with help from my parents , were able to grow , harvest , and market enough produce to more than double our farm income . We also began to expand our methods of selling produce and products from the farm . In fact , the opportunity to market our vegetables and flowers to a wholesale buyer came quite effortlessly . The local extension agent , with whom we were in constant contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the owners of Maine 's three Arby 's restaurants were looking for locally grown produce . Were we interested in talking with Ken Raffel , one of the owners ? With the attitude of " nothing ventured , " Mark set up a meeting at the Auburn franchise ? the one that Roger now manages . Mark was enthusiastic when he returned from the meeting . He had learned that Ken and his brother , Jim , were sons of the founder of Arby 's , and when they decided to settle in Maine with their families , they bought three franchises in the state . Their social and political commitments encouraged them to support local farming and food manufacturing ( they have in fact led the way in the state for such support ) , and they wanted a local supplier for some of their vegetables . Other farmers at the markets were also told about the wholesale opportunity , but everyone else shunned the idea of doing business with local restaurants . They were cynical about our interest and enthusiasm , but we felt optimistic about the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables . Unlike some of the other farmers in our area , we had no history of wholesale agreements gone sour . We had never grown large amounts of vegetables only to have the prospective // buyer change his mind and refuse to take the produce . We were responding to the offer with a naive trust that the agreement could be made to work . Moreover , we could quite accurately project our gardening needs , because the restaurants were able to provide us , a year in advance , with projected usage figures for all the things that they would like to purchase from our farm . So , based on our belief in the sincerity of the offer , we planned our next garden both to supply the restaurant orders and to continue our sales at three farmers ' markets . Roger , Mark , and I worked together for the remainder of that first summer and fall , until wood began to be hauled in for the winter and Roger left for three months to free-lance as a woodsman . In March he returned , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that would include our ideas on passive solar heating , with a back-up wood heating system . We had to hire a bulldozer to move the two feet of snow that remained on the ground before we could lay out a foundation , which that year consisted of a simple wooden plate leveled on top of rocks and cement blocks . We had cedar milled for the framing , and we glazed the front , south-facing wall with rigid greenhouse fiberglass . We finished construction just in time to begin transplanting the seedlings we were growing both for ourselves and for selling at the farmers ' markets . The income from seedling sales that year just about covered the cost of building the greenhouse At first the new greenhouse space seemed more than adequate , but our ambitions seem to keep full pace with our expansion , and the next year we were quickly erecting another greenhouse . That season we had neither the time nor the money to build a proper structure , so we hurriedly erected a pole greenhouse with newly cut young trees . The poles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in fact some of them sprouted branches that summer . We studded the roof with two-by-eights and closed in the building with six-mil plastic . IIo A SMALL FARM IN MAINE Since we were pressed for growing space , plastic and fiberglass structures were put up rather quickly on the back lawn of our farmhouse . The mixture of reasonably designed and slapdash greenhouses was certainly never beautiful , but the buildings allowed us to expand our spring seedling business and to experiment with different varieties of vegetables , flowers , and herbs . More than anything , the new space fed our growing enthusiasm for working with plants . Spring became a favorite time at the farm for all three of us . Sowing the seed flats , watching for the first cotyledons , waiting for the emergence of true leaves , and the ensuing frenzy of trying to transplant thousands of young plants kept us so busy that our farming season quite naturally expanded back into February . With the need for working in the field all summer , harvesting into the fall , and cutting wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for Roger at the farm . After the first season of delivering vegetables to three restaurants and three farmers ' markets , we examined the efforts it had taken to maintain all these accounts . It was more work than we felt we could sustain , so we pulled out of one farmers ' market . At the same time , we expanded our wholesale business by contracting for sales with a few other restaurants located along the delivery route to Arby 's . In addition , we started to manufacture our first farm product when we began processing our cabbage into coleslaw for Arby 's ? a suggestion that came from the restaurants ' owners . Before investing in a commercial cabbage shredder , we actually sliced some twelve hundred pounds of cabbage on an old single-blade wooden hand shredder , and grated carrots with a small kitchen tool . We experimented with several different slaw recipes and packaging techniques before coming up with a consistently good product that the restaurants said they would be willing to purchase on a regular basis . The slaw , made from green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound , whereas the cabbage alone brought in only about fifteen cents a pound at the FULL-TIME FARMERS III farmers ' markets . But as important as the increase in price was the fact that the demand for coleslaw lasted all season , and we figured we could grow hundreds of winter-storage cabbages and process slaw during the fall and early winter , when income from vegetables had ended . We went ahead and purchased a commercial shredder and began to make thousands of pounds of coleslaw . The most significant thing about this undertaking was the notion that we could look at all of our produce from the standpoint of whether it could be turned into products . If we could manufacture products , we could perhaps increase the farm income and keep labor on the farm for a longer work year . Furthermore , if we could grow crops that could be manufactured during off-season months , then we had the chance to develop the farm into a year-round business . These are probably obvious concepts to any business-minded person , but for us the discovery was exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex . The three of us now had a small seedling business , a small vegetable farm , and a coleslaw manufacturing endeavor . All of this was run from the glass greenhouse that opened off our kitchen , the few structures on our back lawn , and very often the kitchen itself , where we washed , chopped , and bagged thousands of pounds of slaw from August until early January . There were some obvious drawbacks to having all of these operations in the middle of our home . For starters , you ca n't shred that much cabbage without its ending up all over the counters , walls , and floors of your house . Despite our best efforts to clean up after the work was done , the remnants of rapidly deteriorating cabbage leaves gave off a fragrance that overtook the farmhouse . Our physical facilities were sorely inadequate , and Mark and I soon grew impatient with the situation . It was becoming apparent that we needed another building . In the spring of 198o we began the first farm project to be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our barn in the northeast corner of our major production field . II2 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE We drew up plans for a two-story , gambrel-roofed structure , where we dreamed we would keep crops , process food , store tools and machinery , and repair automotive and farm machinery . We cut lumber from our own land and had it milled into heavy structural timbers ? six-by-tens for floor supports , two-by-sixes for studding , and different one-inch boards for finishing . When the cutting and milling was done , we ran out of money to go beyond capping the foundation with a first floor . It was the last fall work for that year , completed after the wood was in and just before the snows began . We finished in time to cover the floor with a large sheet of plastic , which we anchored down with old tires . That left us just enough money to get us through the winter and purchase seeds for the next season . Late in the winter of 198o , we put together a rather plainly designed , home-typed couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm that spring . We reproduced the pages on the mimeograph machine at the local high school and distributed copies to every neighbor and friend and to all the customers at the farmers ' market for whom we had names and addresses . We called the mailing our seedling preorder package , and it invited customers to place plant orders early in the spring at a reduced price . We figured that we could plan our seedling business more accurately if we could encourage customers to order early . Their orders would give us some notion of what our total spring plant sales might be . It would also commit customers to purchasing their seedlings from our farm , instead of buying them on impulse from their local gardening centers . Furthermore , by asking for a small deposit with each order , we could generate a bit of working capital early in the season . The first year 's response was modest : about two dozen people told us what plants they would like to have ready in May . The next season we produced a more elaborate seedling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we planned an open house , to show off our new greenhouse and cold frames and to try to // stimulate plant sales on the farm rather than at the farmers ' markets . Our invitation for the open house went out in the form of a flier , and we also put several small ads in the local newspapers . We scheduled the event for a Saturday and Sunday in the middle of May . We had no idea what the turnout would be . I clearly remember watching the road early that Saturday morning , waiting and wondering whether anyone would show up . Cars began to drive down the road . The first ones belonged mainly to friends and neighbors who had come to support us . Then there were cars containing members of the community who were curious as to who we were and what we were doing with the old Turner farm . More cars arrived , with people we had met at various farmers ' markets . They wanted to see where we lived and where we grew the food they had been purchasing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attracted two or three hundred people , and we had served as many cups of coffee and tea and homemade cookies . As an opening gambit , it had been very successful , not to mention a good deal of fun . We met dozens of community families , many of them on Sunday , after word of mouth had prompted their curiosity . I am fairly certain that many of our Sunday visitors showed up to sample the free refreshments rather than to purchase plants , but whatever caused the turnout , we knew that the idea was valid and well worth continuing another year . Interestingly enough , there are very few spring events or fairs in Maine . The fall is replete with agricultural events , but there seems to be very little ritual for the spring , a time when even seasoned farmers are optimistic and backyard gardeners are committed to planting , weeding , and watering like never before . Pam came that year as well . She owned a farm about twenty miles from ours , and raised over a hundred head of Hereford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of pigs and ducks . In addition , she studied music and gave occasional piano concerts , and sometimes designed clothing for herself and a few friends . We had met originally at a meeting of local farmers , I14 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE and Mark and I asked her if she would like to sell some of her eggs during our open house . The friendship between Pam and Mark and me did not begin cautiously or slowly . She was for me , at last , another woman living in the country , a woman with enormous energy who shared my interests . The women I had come to know and admire in the city were as busy with their lives as I was with mine , and over the years we were in touch less and less . Since coming to the country , I had not met many other women as interested as I was in agriculture and the arts . Several women were involved in homesteading , but that usually meant that their affinity was for the traditional homemaking skills , and thus I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also looking for people who could understand her particular combination of interests and who could appreciate the strong bond one forms with a place in the country . She and her husband had retreated to the country to raise cattle . When they separated , Pam stayed at the farm with their son , Aaron , and tried to run the whole operation , raise a small child , and keep up her involvement in music and painting . She was torn between holding onto a physically and economically difficult beef farm and trying to establish herself as a clothing designer . It was a dilemma that took her years to unravel , and during that time our friendship grew and matured . When Mark and I repeated our open house the following spring , we called it an open house/spring fair . We liked the idea of including other exhibitors and invited a few potters , basketmakers , collectors of antique tools , and wool producers to join in . The crowds increased rapidly , as did our preorder seedling business . All of this was . Pam came again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first step toward ending the agricultural business and making the transition to designing . She also brought along a few of her designed clothes . Nikki came with handmade quilted hangings . FULL-TIME FARMERS II5 David brought his silver jewelry . Johnny 's Selected Seeds had a good display of seeds , garden tools , and books . There were maplesyrup producers and craftspeople with toys and wooden items . On Saturday it was cold and rainy , but customers came anyway , so we frantically cleaned out the rooms on the first floor of our farmhouse and moved the craftspeople inside . Sunday turned out sunny and warm , and everyone went back outdoors . Perhaps there are few spring fairs because there is a very good possibility of rain and an absolute certainty of blackflies . But the people who continue to attend our fairs over the years joke goodheartedly about the weather and the flies , and the meek simply stay away . For three summers Pam worked with us at the farm on a parttime basis . During that time the focus of work gradually began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved . We included fresh and a few everlasting flowers in our field production so that we could offer bouquets to customers at farmers ' markets and to restaurants . At first we grew the most common annuals and perennials , but we expanded the planting each year , so that we soon were growing more than two dozen varieties of everlastings alone . The everlasting bouquets were very popular , especially during the fall market sales . I 'll never forget making my first herbal wreath . Mark and I were asked by a local food cooperative to talk about growing and drying herbs and flowers , a subject that we knew a little about . I was also asked to demonstrate herbal wreath making , a subject I knew nothing about . I had once examined a wreath made of very delicate artemisias and small everlastings , and I decided that I could probably reproduce the process . I took an old coathanger , fashioned it into a circle , and crimped it with a pair of pliers . Then I cut picture-hanging wire into uniform lengths , clustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the wire circle . But my folly was in trying to tie a wreath for the first time while talking to a small group assembled at the food coop . The audience was polite , and I remember everyone saying that 116 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE the wreath was quite beautiful . In fact , I too thought that it came out well , and after the demonstration I gave the wreath to my parents . They hung it in their home . A few years later I looked at it much more critically , and now I wonder how I had the nerve to demonstrate its design in public . I went on to make many hundred more wreaths , and so did my mother , to whom I showed my technique , and so did Pam . Over time , the wreaths improved considerably , and with our expanding varieties of herbs and everlastings , we were able to design bouquets and wreaths that were fairly unusual . Using a few photographs of our work , Mark and I submitted our everlastings to a jury for acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest rural and crafts fair for the granola crowd in the state . Some thirty to forty thousand people now attend this fall fair each year , and the exhibitors include some of the best craftspeople in the state . When we applied in 1981 , there were very few people working with everlastings , and we were delighted to be accepted . For several weeks , my mother , Pam , and I tied and decorated herbal wreaths , Roger , Mark , Pam , and I assembled bouquets , carefully wrapped them in white tissue paper , and tied them with ribbons . Then we set up a booth at our first big crafts fair . Since we had the only booth offering everlastings , we sold over two hundred bouquets , several dozen wreaths , and a few dried herbs for cooking , and took home over $2000 after three days of exhibiting . That same fall Mark took some samples of our work to a few craft stores and boutiques in Maine and in the Boston area , and we got our first wholesale orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everlastings was a significant new venture , because now we had a crop that gave us the opportunity to manufacture and market all through the winter . At some time in the early stages of our dried-flower business , I remember , Mark said that there must be manufactured wire frames for making wreaths and why did n't I call up some floral suppliers and inquire . I replied that it was just as easy to bend FULL-TIME FARMERS II7 and crimp old coathangers , which was easy for me to say , because as our production increased , this was a job that Mark ended up having to do . But when I began to work with small arrangements of dried materials , I had to rummage around in our attic or in secondhand shops to find containers which I could fill with newspaper or sand to hold the flower stems . One day , out of sheer desperation , Mark hunted through the yellow pages of a Portland telephone directory and called a wholesaler of floral supplies to ask whether they carried wreath frames and baskets we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fully stocked brown van and a sales representative named Tillie . It was quite a revelation to learn that a whole industry existed to sell endless sizes of wreath frames , floral tape , floral picks , foam bricks for flower arranging , ribbons , baskets , pottery , and whatever else you might need . It was also a huge relief to Mark to be freed from transforming all of our coathangers into wreath frames . As our dried-flower production grew , we were extremely lucky to have Pam on the staff and my mother available for so many hours each week . Each of these women has an uncommon talent for working with flowers and colors , and there I was working as a designer again , now with flowers instead of magazines . Meanwhile , we had to maintain the seedling business , the field production , and the harvesting for restaurants and farmers ' markets along with the burgeoning business with herbs and everlastings . The demands were often overwhelming , but we felt that there was some economic safety in having a number of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm was about as diversified as we could manage , and we were unwilling to let go of any aspect of the business . We needed more help . Ann joined us for a summer only . She was and still is the librarian at a small community library about twenty miles from here . Like me , Ann made her way to Maine after years of urban experience , which included teaching in a private school in New York City . She requested a summer leave of absence from her library to work with us , as she was intrigued by the notion of I18 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE farming . She could not have had a rougher initiation ? the summer she joined us was perhaps one of the hardest we have ever had . Needless to say , we were overcommitted , and Mark and Roger and I were driving ourselves , trying to keep pace . That year we also had an infestation of cutworms unlike anything I 've ever seen . Of every hundred plants we set out in the upper field , the cutworms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodchuck . We were planting several thousand heads of cabbage , broccoli , and cauliflower , primarily for the restaurant deliveries . The woodchuck was so bold that after a morning of transplanting , when we returned to the field after our lunch break , the animal had mowed down a good part of what we had set out . To make things more difficult , I was vehemently opposed to shooting any animal . Everyone else indulged my attitude , and we set out milk bottles painted black to frighten off the invader . Those worked for about two days ; then he was right back eating again . Finally I had to face the choice of losing all our income from the crops or killing the woodchuck . Everyone had long since lost patience with my pacifism at the expense of our gardens . But all that summer I felt sad about having to kill wildlife , and perhaps this led to my first inclinations to give up vegetable production , if it meant having to guard our income with a rifle . There are always a few rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crows pulling out young corn , but we had never been sufficiently bothered to trap or shoot anything until that summer . Even with five of us , Roger , Ann , Pam , Mark , and I were really pressed to plant , maintain , harvest , manufacture , and deliver our goods to the markets , restaurants , and shops that were carrying our things . It was a taxing time for all of us , both physically and emotionally . Ann worked extremely hard , and like us before her she watched her body become strong and muscled and her gardening abilities increase . She also knew clearly , long before the end of the summer , that she did n't want to be a farmer . At the end of her four-month stay , she was more than happy to return to the library . // We anticipated Ann 's leaving , but while she was at the farm she gave enormous energy and commitment to her work . She also made some interesting observations about how people learn to recognize patterns of vegetative growth and plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills that the rest of us simply took for granted , and so we were able to relive our own growth through her training . We were sorry to see her go , disappointed that the summer had been so hard for her . It made us all reflect on our own attachment to farming . But at the same time , we had known that she was simply trying it out , and we were prepared for her return to the library . Pam 's commitment was always undefined , because she came to work and help out when it coincided with our needs and her availability . We gained so much from each other . She used our farm as a place to withdraw gradually from farm work after she sold off her cattle , then her chickens , and then the other farm animals . When we worked together on design projects , we were constantly able to draw similarities between designing with flowers and with fabric . The problems of textures , colors , forms , and techniques are the same whatever materials are being manipulated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music on radio or tapes , and we chatted endlessly about music and politics . As her clothing business began to take shape , she had less time to spend here , but our friendship continues and our conversations now include the problems of managing small businesses . When Pam first stopped working here , I missed her terribly . I wanted someone to bounce ideas off . I wanted someone to challenge my own developing style with everlastings . I wanted someone to listen to a piece of music with and to comment on its form . And although I can and do share all of these thoughts with Mark , I realized that I missed another woman , and that the farm with Mark , Roger , and me had been a very male-oriented workplace Pam came and went gradually ; Ann came and went after a defined period of time . But Roger came for an indefinite stay . I20 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE With Roger , Mark and I did the heaviest , hardest , most significant work of developing the farm into a real small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should to make a diversified farm viable . In the process , we became totally involved in one another 's lives and goals . Roger went through a troublesome separation and divorce , and for several months moved in with us while he tried to sort out where he wanted to live . When his personal life was most in turmoil , he hid himself in work , and the three of us labored relentlessly to build the wholesale businesses in food and everlastings . During that same period we completed the barn , and Mark finished his dissertation . None of the three of us was ready for the inevitable : that Roger would one day wish to look for another job , for more opportunities for himself , and for the security of more money and the typical benefits of a traditional workplace . The separation was painful . Each of us felt so dependent on the others . Mark and I could n't imagine doing all the work without Roger , because he was so much a part of the growth that he knew as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day . And I 'm certain that he felt loyal to the place and to us , having been a principal member . But in fact the farm was still a family farm , and there were only limited opportunities for someone else . It was really Mark and I who made the major decisions about money , direction , and goals . We were ultimately responsible for the dayto-day management decisions as other people joined the staff . Although Roger was given the job of field manager , he was still answerable to us , and the job became too small , too restrictive . It was time for him to look for a position with more potential . And even though we understood what was happening , and even though we had in fact done the same things ourselves during our twenties , Mark and I hated to see him leave . We three manufactured some bad feelings around the time of leaving , much as small children manufacture an argument just before they know one of them has to go home . I guess it was our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so overlaid with // years of commitment to each other and to a project that none of us has wanted to let go of the friendship . We were very vulnerable to one another , and the understanding of that vulnerability has helped us to re-evaluate our relationships with many people who have since come to work with us . I feel I have a few insights about workplaces , both those in which I have participated and the one I now direct with Mark . I also have some hopes for any group of people working together , and the hopes and the insights are sometimes at odds with each other . I thought that we could create a workplace where everyone felt equal , where everyone felt confident that his or her efforts were appreciated and respected . I wanted a place where people would have time to learn , to be stimulated by the sheer fact of learning . I wanted a workplace where people would take risks , take part in decision making , where things were very participatory At the same time , Mark and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our opinions and tastes , and totally caught up in the creation of a small business , from which we almost never take a break . No outside person should or can possibly be as involved as we are . No other person can know all of the things that we are thinking or planning , since so many of our discussions take place outside the boundaries of the traditional workday . And although the business finances have been fairly clearly reported to others on the staff , there is no way for them to know about or to worry about the weeks when cash simply does n't appear or when the increasing costs of workman 's compensation or insurance take their toll . No one can be as involved as we are . More important , we are the owners and therefore are inevitably seen as the people in charge , and we thus exercise a certain control over the lives of people with whom we are in daily contact . Now we try to sort all of that out in establishing our relationships with the many people who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intimate place , and when our ranks are swelled I22 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE by summer staff , we are still never more than a dozen people , including my parents . Working as closely together as we do , intimacy inevitably grows , as we talk about our lives , our families , our problems with money , health , friendships . But despite all of the time that we spend together outside of work ? at each other 's homes for dinner , swapping child care , at concerts , at movies ? we are still aware of the hierarchy in our working relationships . In addition , every employee brings to the workplace a certain set of expectations . When the business is small and family-owned , chances are that the owners are overly committed to its success . Everyone who comes to work here sees that we work hard nearly all of the time , and by inference gets the impression that he or she is expected to work that hard . In fact , when we interview people now , we tell them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are comfortable in a place of high expectations , they will be unhappy at the farm . People never understand the full import of that warning . Some see it as a challenge . Some ignore it , thinking that they will find their own pace here , when we are all doing as much as possible to insure each little part of the business . One year we had to let someone go , after allowing a bad situation to deteriorate for much too long . A new person on the staff was really trying to coast on the work of everyone else . Inexperienced in the skills of managing a group of people , Mark and I tried to talk with this person , who listened well and talked a good line but in the end was not able to take himself or the job as seriously as the rest of us did . Other people on the staff that summer were angry at having to make up work for someone else , and equally angry with Mark and me for letting ourselves be taken advantage of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as the managers was diminished by a single individual . When we finally asked him to leave , we felt a combination of guilt , anger , and sadness for our own failure to deal early on with the difficulty of an employee who does n't work out . // In my own experience as an employee , I always complained that people forget to praise each other for good work but are never slow to criticize . Knowing that full well , I too sometimes forget that praise is needed by everyone , and particularly by the people who work for us . Everyone here is very sensitive to our interpretation of his or her work . More than that , everyone here is quick to interpret our personal moods as having something to do with our feeling about him or her . In such a small workplace , Mark and I have to be very careful of our personal interactions , because they affect everyone else . Conversely , we as employers are vulnerable to the moods and uneven work habits of others . How can we tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waning of interest ? How much are we responsible to the people at the farm , and how much of the normal fluctuations of mood and performance should we simply overlook and ascribe to the moons , the tides , and personal , nonfarm-related causes ? This is always a real trick in a small community . We ask the people who come here to get involved and share in our rather improbable dream . Mark and I started out believing that a small , versatile farm could provide a living for a few people . That belief flies in the face of all odds , and yet we still hold on . As the years have passed , we have continually modified our approach to hiring . It began casually , but we have since tried some very methodical approaches ? ads in the newspapers , resumes , interviews , rating procedures , and careful evaluation . When we played out that procedure to its fullest , we had the most disastrous summer of all . As a friend once commented , perhaps it was because we got caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we should have . There have been years when we swore strongly that we would not hire young people , because they lack commitment and reliability . We now have two high school students on the staff , and each of them comes back year after year . Their youthful insouciance and energy often provide the levity we need to get us through the hardest demands of the summer . 124 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE If I could draw one conclusion about the ways in which the best people have come to Hedgehog Hill , I guess it would have to be that word of mouth , happy coincidence , and chance encounters work well . The best people here have always been those we have asked to join us because we just trusted our instincts about them . Sometimes the people have had relevant work experience . Sometimes they have just been personally appealing , and we have carved out a job in order to have them on the staff . When new people join us , we can usually tell early on whether the decision was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sometimes help shape a job to match that person 's interests and skills . But whatever jobs each of us does on the farm , we are never far away from the nature of our business . And ultimately , if someone does not arrive with or develop a natural love of plants and the out-of-doors , then he or she will not stay long at Hedgehog Hill . So much of the work here is repetitive , physically difficult , tedious , and even mundane that the energy to do the work can only be sustained by a basic interest in the overall goals of the farm . 7 ? MAKING CHANGES ONE DAY Mark and I were sitting at the kitchen table with several years of farm records spread out before us . The discussion we were having was a familiar one : what would we do in the year ahead to improve our lives at the farm ? We had now been living in Maine for four years , and our records told us that we had made some significant progress . But we had also worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had had to adjust our lives drastically to the realities of a rural income . Mark was the first to come out with the question that had been nagging each of us privately , and once he asked it out loud , we both knew that we would be obliged to examine the depth of our commitment to living in the country . " Do you want to work this hard for the rest of your life , Terry ? " The wording was so stark that I was a bit stunned . Then Mark went on to say that he was not certain he would continue to I26 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE farm if it meant that our income was so marginal and the effort it took to earn it was so great . The very fact that he was questioning our choices was a statement about how far we had come in our rural development . It assumed that we could continue our lives this way ; we had acquired enough of the skills we needed to survive . But the simple knowledge that we could survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prospect of working so hard for the next decade had to promise more than a marginal financial return . In fact , we had subsidized our farm 's development with money earned from nonfarm work , and each of us was losing interest in urban consulting . But the basic question addressed more than the economic possibilities ? it asked about the ability of a farming life to nourish us intellectually . I had always credited us with having moved to Maine with some real appreciation for the hard work associated with farming . By now , however , we had come . to appreciate fully not only the physical rigors of the work but the limitations of a traditional farm life . That understanding had not been available to us when we had coupled farming with urban careers . It became a reality only when we adopted the daily regime of small-time farmers . When Mark confronted me with the question , he had just completed his doctoral program and was for the first time in nine years completely free to devote himself fully to the work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my affiliation with Working Papers , which was falling on hard times , and I began to do some consulting for The Atlantic , which had just gone through a change in ownership and was hiring new staff people . For several weeks a year , over a period of about three years , I returned to the magazine 's offices in Boston . The opportunity was very fortunate , both because it gave us some additional income and because it gave me the chance ? the luxury , really ? to look once again at the urban life I had left behind . Now I could contrast that life with the very real experience of several seasons in Maine . By this time , as I have described , the farm had evolved into a series of small and separate agricultural activities , each of which contributed to the overall business . We had taken a seasonal // vegetable farm and expanded it into a year-round operation . On the face of it , we had every reason to feel optimistic , but despite our development , the expenses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still monitoring every expenditure , justifying every purchase in terms of its practicality and its relevance to the success of the business . There was no such thing as extra , expendable income . There were no frivolous decisions about spending money and the constant pressure of having so little income and so few options to consume goods and services , at whatever level , was wearing us down . Despite our relatively modest needs for new clothes , cars , and household articles , we wanted more flexibility with our time and our income . The first years had undeniably been stimulating , but they had also been austere . Moreover , we were becoming aware of the fact that we would need a bigger income in the years ahead because we would want to have the option of sending our son to a private high school , a financial need we had not contemplated when we moved to the country . From the moment that Jacob entered school , we heard from his teachers and from his elementary-school principal that the school system was not equipped to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better education and the company of more peers , which was not available in our community . Although our work had insulated us from the limitations of life in a small rural town , it had done little to protect our son from feeling lonely and different . So both of us knew some of the answers to Mark 's question . We could work very hard for many more years , but probably not without receiving a few of the rewards typically associated with hard work . It 's uncomfortable to have to re-examine your choices , because it almost always means that you are about to make changes and perhaps take more risks . It was also hard for us to look critically at all the aspects of our farming , because we sensed that whatever decisions we reached would probably involve giving up some of our original goals . It was most difficult to re-examine our commitment to raising I28 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE produce and working with other farmers at the markets . From farmers ' markets alone we were generating about one quarter of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentyfive percent of our time on vegetable production . It was also true that the markets were never predictable outlets for crops , subject as they were to the fluctuations of weather and to customer interest over the years . The markets had had a certain novelty in their infancy , and the energy of their early years had usually attracted a strong following . But as time went by , the customers dwindled , partly because the novelty was wearing off and partly because it was simply easier to do all the weekly shopping at the local supermarkets . The supermarket owners had quickly responded to the pressure of the farmers ' markets by redesigning their produce sections to mimic the feeling of an open-air market ? there were more bins of unpackaged produce , more native-grown fruits and vegetables . The supermarkets also had large budgets for competitive advertising and could offer special price advantages when crops were in large supply . We could not compete with them in a price war . Farmers ' markets that had failed to educate their consumers about the advantages of freshly picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold customers intent on saving money . Individual members of the farmers ' markets also failed to respond to the challenge from the supermarkets . If we had wanted to continue to attract customers , we should have given some real thought to promotion and marketing ideas that would have continued to stimulate interest . It was no longer adequate simply to sell vegetables off the tailgates of our trucks ? we needed to promote the markets , and to find some ways of developing them into more substantial and even year-round marketing centers . I think that there were real possibilities for us to locate inexpensive permanent housing within some of the abandoned innercity buildings , where we could have expanded our marketing days and increased the selling season by setting up exchanges with farmers in different parts of the country . Mark and I tried to talk // with other members about cooperative and entrepreneurial efforts we might make as a group , but we were never able to create any interest or dialogue . I think that these ideas just seemed too ambitious , too cooperative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the group 's goals were becoming less compatible , and our disaffection with the farmers ' markets began . We did undertake one final project for the whole market , which eventually became a major focus for our own farm 's growth . It began as a workshop series , a group of four weekly lectures offered free to the Lewiston-Auburn community . The series was housed in a newly developed shopping complex designed from an abandoned fire station . The interior was attractively restored and contained a good restaurant , a gourmet food store , a toy shop , a crafts gallery , and other boutiques . The second floor had a large hall where we offered the talks , and the owner of the Engine House , as it was called , underwrote the promotion and advertising of the series , which she hoped would attract customers to her new center . Mark and I designed the workshop series , gave some of the classes ourselves , and cajoled two other members of the farmers ' market into teaching with us . Most of the other market members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was even one hostile confrontation with a member who announced that she was sick and tired of our ambitions for the group . I think that many saw the series as a kind of grandstanding on our part . Community members , however , responded differently , and each of the workshops was filled with men and women who seemed interested in many aspects of horticulture and in the activities of the farmers and the market . The response to the series was not surprising to us ? we had only to look around at the articles in magazines and newspapers and the reports of seed companies and nurseries to know that there was a national renaissance in backyard and community gardening . But the apparent success of the workshop series did little to persuade members of the farmers ' 130 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE market that we should continue our efforts to promote the group . It seemed to me that there were many opportunities available to us . We could have improved the workshop series ; we could have worked with community officials in developing neighborhood gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these projects would have taken an extraordinary amount of time , planning , and energy , and without any belief in their value , no one was going to get involved . And I will be the first to admit that promoting any idea , any effort , is not always enjoyable . The public aggressiveness that it takes to market made most of the farmers extremely uncomfortable . The fact that the group was made up of individuals who had chosen to live and work independently and away from urban centers should have told us something about its personality . Some of the most appealing qualities about the market members as people were precisely the qualities that made them incapable of promoting themselves . I can sympathize with anyone 's shyness at having to promote his or her own interests , and to this day both Mark and I are basically uncomfortable with our need constantly to promote our farm . But I am also very aware of the fact that unless we are willing to keep up that effort , we have no hope of making a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not encouraging Partly out of disappointment and partly because of the real possibility we felt we saw in gardening education , Mark and I pulled out of the farmers ' markets and began to concentrate on developing our own farm in a new direction . Our first efforts were very simple . We started by collecting the names and addresses of all of our customers at the markets , and we added to that list the names of people who had attended the first workshop series at the Engine House , with a view to holding another workshop series in the future . During these same years , we began to be approached by local granges , garden clubs , and organic farming groups to give talks on various aspects of our farm . Initially , we were very flattered // to be asked , and agreed to carry our slide projector and slides of the gardens and greenhouses around to luncheons , evening meetings , and dinner talks . A little more than a decade of working the land had supplied us with enough information and amusing anecdotes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real bonus , because he was amassing a good collection of gardening photographs and individual plant studies . Each of us had done enough teaching so that we felt comfortable in front of an audience , and we enjoyed the response to our enthusiasm for gardening . We had no idea , however , how quickly the word gets around that free speakers are available , and we were soon giving more talks and gathering more names for our mailing list . The second time we offered a workshop series , it was at our farm . We designed a mailing piece that announced the series and described four classes in growing vegetables , annuals , perennials , and everlastings , one subject each week for four weeks . Response to the mailing was quite good : nearly fifty people signed up for the classes , which we conducted in the farmhouse . We converted the dining room into a classroom and set up our slides and projector . We lectured , had a lengthy question-and-answer period on gardening problems , served lunch , and then encouraged everyone to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . We also used the time to promote the activities of the farm , beginning with a very conscious effort to get people to buy our seedlings , vegetables , and flowers at the farm rather than at the farmers ' markets . We knew that this effort would be a gradual one , and that we would have to develop the facilities at the farm if we were going to give up marketing from the back of our truck . We also knew that it would take us several years to build up a clientele , so we systematically collected the names and addresses of everyone we met at lectures , classes , or fairs . The following year , we decided to hold the workshop series in the fall , because we had found it difficult to develop a greenhouse 132 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE business and teach at the same time . The fall series was focused exclusively on growing and designing with everlastings , and it was predicated on our own increasing interest in dried flowers and what we felt was a widespread public interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to a dozen people each . More than eighty people registered , and we spent hours on the phone and in correspondence with people , trying to schedule enough additional classes to take advantage of the response . We had clearly underestimated the interest . The format for the classes was modeled on the first series of classes we had offered . The morning was devoted to a lecture and a question-and-answer session on basic gardening techniques that could be applied to raising dried material . We identified and talked about two or three dozen varieties of cultivated plants , and encouraged students to look for wild materials that they could gather and use . We served a simple lunch , and in the afternoon I demonstrated two projects for people to work on , making an everlasting wreath and designing an arrangement with dried flowers . We made dried materials available for these projects , and some students purchased them to work with , but we also asked people to feel free to bring their own things . I will never forget my impressions of the students in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly , and in many cases they had considerable experience in garden clubs , in growing , and even in arranging . On hearing the conversations that took place over coffee and tea before each class began , I quickly revised my lecture into a seminar , knowing full well that I had a class of enthusiastic and informed people . Mark and I really liked the workshops , right from the beginning . We learned a great deal from the people who came , because many of them were devoted gardeners who came not just for the information we offered but because they simply wanted to be around other gardeners . Over the next several years , we doubled and tripled the number of classes . At first our students came from the nearby communities , then from further away ; evenMAKING // tually , as the portion of our farm devoted to everlastings grew , people began to travel here from different parts of the country and even from Canada . Some people took the everlasting class two or three times , and it was from students that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could spend another day at the farm . There was no doubt that teaching was developing into a satisfying part of our work . Every knowledgeable student in a class stimulated us to work harder , study harder , educate ourselves more , so we could feel that our classes were worthwhile . As the teaching aspect of our farm has grown , we have become increasingly reluctant to offer a workshop until we have had ample time to study and prepare a day that is worth the price of admission . That reluctance is shaped from our own early experience in attending seminars and colloquia offered by a variety of agencies throughout New England . When we started farming , we were hungry for information , and we signed up for day-long workshops and attended talks on land use , product development , marketing , and business skills . With few exceptions , we were greatly disappointed in the lectures and presentations . We found that the speakers were unenthusiastic , underprepared , and sometimes inaccurate . So we try to evaluate our own workshops to make certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has wasted time . Some participants complain of just the opposite ? that we give them too much information to absorb in a day . I am more comfortable with that complaint . As the workshops became better known , we realized that we might be able to attract even more people to the farm if we could find some newspapers and magazines that would publish articles about the classes . We had begun to advertise , using a very modest budget , but there was no way that we could afford to pay for the exposure that published articles would effect . Using our knowledge of how the press works , Mark wrote letters to the editors of a number of publications , describing the classes and suggesting that the publications might want to list them in their calendars 134 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE as a reader service . We attached our workshop brochures to the letters , and just as we had hoped , several editors called and inquired about the classes . There followed two major articles on the farm . The first appeared in Down East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , and described our move from Boston and our attempts to develop a business . The second was written for Horticulture by a writer who attended one of the everlasting workshops and then expanded the material from the class into an article about dried flowers . We had very consciously tried to get the attention of the press , but we were very lucky , because these two articles , published in 1984 and 1985 , gave us national exposure . These days we are constantly looking for ways to make our farm visible to all forms of media , and we spend an appreciable amount of time promoting our business . I am certain that a few readers will wince at learning this , because we all sense some basic contradiction between the romantic mythology of a small farm and the more guileful world of marketing . But small farms are not exempt from any of the demands of other businesses . If it were not for our urban skills in publishing , designing , and teaching , we would have found it very difficult to devise any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been difficult , but the constant need to do it is the most unpleasant aspect of our work . Mark sends out news releases about our classes , about the spring fairs , and about whatever activities we feel might make interesting reading . If one of us has the chance to give talks or go on television shows , we take advantage of it . There are many ways to get public exposure without buying advertising space . As I mentioned earlier , organizations and institutions are always looking for guest speakers , and when we became aware of this , we rather indiscriminately agreed to travel and talk about our farm and about the various aspects of our business . At a certain point we had to re-evaluate how much time we were spending on free talks , and we began to accept invitations for the audiences // we were most interested in reaching and to charge a fee for speaking . Of course , this was after we felt that our presentations were valuable and we were confident that we could and needed to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady response to our classes in everlastings , we began to look for ways to expand the workshops . The next class was developed around our interest in herbs , both those that could be used as ornamentals and everlastings and those that we valued for culinary purposes . When we started growing herb plants for sale , we offered only the most common cooking herbs , such as basil , parsley , marjoram , dill , and thyme . The herbs did not sell themselves ; we had to promote them , at the farmers ' markets and at the farm as well . In order to do that , we had to learn more about their use , and so we began to experiment with herbs in cooking , teas , and potpourri , and we also started designing gardens with herbs . We borrowed and bought books on the subject , and discovered an area of horticulture that has fascinated gardeners for centuries . All the time we devote to studying seems luxurious , but everything that we have studied becomes part of the material we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers information in the form of small mimeographed pages with some botanical notations and a few simple recipes . These were a great asset in distinguishing our plants both at the farmers ' markets and at the farm . By the time we offered our first herb workshop in 1984 , we had enough experience in growing and cooking to present a basic introductory class , and enough customers were involved with their first herb gardens to want more information . This is just another example of the way in which the development of the farm constantly challenges us to experiment , study , and learn in order to attract customers by doing what is most interesting to us . Our plant and seedling business evolved in much the same way . The business was founded on sales of extra amounts of the plants that we needed for our own field production . We tested 136 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE the varieties , made choices we felt we could rely on , and then offered plants for sale that we felt were suited to our climate . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might have made some very different choices of plants to sell . For example , you can purchase seed for many varieties of sweet green peppers at about $4 an ounce . They will germinate , and they will look like good seedlings when they go on sale , but they are almost always unsuited to the Maine soils and growing season . As farmers , we learned that we could always rely on a couple of hybrid peppers that cost $40 to $50 an ounce . Despite the cost , we naturally chose the hybrid varieties for our vegetable business , and we also chose these varieties for plant sales , because we were totally dependent not only on one-time sales but on developing a faithful clientele . When we started selling seedlings at the farmers ' markets , we offered the usual assortment of vegetables and popular bedding plants , such as marigolds , petunias , and impatiens . So did every other farmer , and so does every other nursery and garden center , not to mention some supermarkets and discount department stores . We figured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants . Once we restricted our business to selling at the farm , we had to offer unusual varieties , or people simply would not make the extra effort to come . More important , neither Mark nor I was interested in producing larger and larger quantities of a few popular plants . And I suppose we rationalized our need to experiment constantly with unusual herbs , ornamentals , everlastings , and perennials by saying that we wanted to create our own niche in the plant sales business . In fact , I do n't believe that we would stand a chance of developing any clientele unless we wanted to do just that . The fact that we are trying to develop a business from a remote farm in the foothills of western Maine has pressured us into looking for unusual ways to farm . Trying to solve those problems has been a large part of what captures our attention . // By 1984 we had withdrawn completely from the farmers ' markets and concentrated all our vegetable production on the wholesale market . We hoped to replace the lost income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lined up a certain number of accounts that we felt were reliable : the three Arby 's restaurants and about eight other , smaller restaurants located along the delivery route . If all went according to plan , we could start making deliveries early in July and continue until late in the fall . For the wholesale accounts alone , we were planting about five thousand pepper plants , one thousand tomato plants , several thousand cabbages , and smaller amounts of peas , beans , radishes , carrots , broccoli , cauliflowers , eggplants , and fresh flowers . Twice a week we had to telephone all the restaurants to find out what they wanted , and in some cases we had to negotiate prices , since we were always being compared with the out-ofstate wholesalers . Once the orders had been gathered , we had to pick , sort , wash , weigh , pack , and label the produce for delivery . Usually Mark or my father would head out early on the delivery day , with the station wagon or the truck loaded with hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty miles round trip , and involved anything from eight to a dozen deliveries . By the time Mark or my father returned to the farm , it was late in the day and he was absolutely exhausted . Then we had a one-day break from deliveries , during which all of us would work on other projects , such as gathering everlastings , drying herbs , teaching classes , doing book work , or dealing with customers at the shop . Then we would repeat the whole process of calling , negotiating , gathering , and hauling produce to the restaurants once again . By making certain that we sorted our produce and delivered only the finest-quality , unblemished food , and by being absolutely reliable about delivery , despite the weather in which we might have to pick or drive , we managed to keep our accounts for a first season , and then we carried many over for a second year . We even added a few more small restaurants to our list of 138 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE buyers . We did manage to replace our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a formidable amount of work to manage vegetable production along with the other activities . In the fall of 1983 , Roger had given notice that he would be leaving , and so we really felt pressed to review and possibly revise our thinking during that winter . Would we simply look for another Roger ? a person who would work in the greenhouses , fields , and shop , doing everything from carpentry to designing with everlastings ? For another year , at least , we wanted to continue our vegetable production . This decision was made as much by sentiment as by wisdom . We had revised our farm so much over the past several years that we were reluctant to continue changing . Neither Mark nor I was prepared to stop growing food for sale . We had developed certain skills in growing quality produce , and we also felt bound by some of our commitments to restaurant owners . We sensed too that by discontinuing our wholesale business , we would be cutting ourselves off completely from direct sales away from the farm . Our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of our discontinued road . With those sentiments guiding our direction , we decided to hire at least one and possibly two new people for the upcoming season . That would allow us to develop the greenhouse business , maintain the vegetable production at the same level , and increase the scale of our everlasting and herb plantings and the number of products that we could design with them . We also planned to increase the number of workshops by offering summer sessions , in the hope of attracting tourists to the farm . We were becoming aware of the fact that we needed to expand our clientele beyond the state borders , in case we someday had the opportunity to market our products by mail . In addition to these plans , Mark and I had each signed a book contract , so we would need more time away from the day-to-day demands to research and write . We placed a few ads in the newspapers and began the process of interviewing for new staff . We ended up hiring three people . // Although this meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that we very much needed time to concentrate on marketing and writing . All three new people began to work in April . By the end of the month , one of them had " remembered " a previous injury that would prevent him from doing the work . It was a conveniently discovered injury , occurring as it did the morning after our first day of hard physical labor in the fields . However , this man did exit early and gracefully , and we did not have to deal with the unpleasantness of letting him go . Our experience with one of the other new employees was less easy . We had failed to evaluate his ability to work hard or well , and our expectations and his were worlds apart . Tensions built over the summer , ending in harsh feelings and disappointment on both sides . The third person was delightful , and we hoped that he would stay on to become involved in farming and teaching . But that fall he was offered a position with the National Audubon Society , and left to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worked . By the end of the season , then , we were right back to square one . Would we hire new people for the next season and go through the difficult and demanding process of training them to work with plants , deal with restaurant accounts , and wait on customers at the farm ? Our figures told us that we had generated only a little more from selling vegetables wholesale than we had paid out in wages . But there had been the constant demands of a larger staff , of training , and of the administration and paperwork that are associated with a larger business . We were discouraged with the efforts it had taken to get through the season , and we were a little wary of interviewing again , knowing that we might have learned something from experience but that we would have to invest a lot of energy in starting over . Our doubts about looking for , hiring , and training new people also begged a larger issue , and that was whether or not we really wanted to continue raising vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade learning about the varieties that grew 140 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE well in our climate . We had increased our yields and could probably continue to improve on them . We understood the cycles of production and could anticipate the retail and wholesale demands of our area . We felt certain that we would not want to market vegetables on a larger scale , because we could do so only at the expense of the other activities at the farm . It 's hard to give up something one has worked hard to learn and has come to do rather well . A few close friends forecast our withdrawal from vegetable farming before we were ready to articulate it ourselves . But in truth we were overextended , and much more interested in what we could learn and do with the other aspects of our business . Our interest was shifting away from food production and toward the growth of herbs , everlastings , and ornamental plants . We called and wrote to all of our restaurant accounts during the winter of 1984 , announcing that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we both felt that we were actually giving up farming ; we had not really accepted the legitimacy of a flower and herb farm , and yet the last season had shown us on paper that every other aspect of the farm produced more income than growing vegetables did . If we were not going to generate the money from vegetables , then could we make a viable small business by growing and manufacturing products with everlastings and herbs ? Once we could ask ourselves this question , we had pretty much established the direction for the upcoming season . The constant need that Mark and I have to look critically at what we are doing is both essential and unsettling . Our evolving lives in the country are infinitely more demanding than the professional lives we left behind . Every decision that we must make has to take into account our individual needs and the degree to which those needs are compatible with the development of a farm that can produce satisfactory work , stimulation , and income . To the degree that we have both been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed fortunate . We began // coming to the farm when we were in our twenties . It is now two decades later , and we are still driven by the same ambition to learn . We try to develop a business that will satisfy that need , perhaps before all others . The adjustments that we have had to make to each other 's needs have been less difficult than the adjustments we have had to face as our farm evolves . Nowhere is this more true than in the necessity to accept the farm as the actual center for our teaching , writing , and selling . This change has transformed our home from a private and isolated spot into a place that welcomes , entertains , feeds , and courts a growing public . Whereas our discontinued road seldom saw vehicles ( except those of family and friends and the postman ) during the first dozen years of our occupancy , it is now traveled daily by customers we have quite purposefully tried to attract to our greenhouses , shop , and classes . When we started teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the classes , and so for three years , until the barn cum shop was completed , we had to conduct workshops in our home , which probably contributed a lot to their success . People liked coming into our old farmhouse , and they enjoyed the lunches cooked and served in a family kitchen . Even when we were able to move our business out of our home , so the workshops and retailing could take place in a building some distance from the house , we still had to establish regular business hours and honor those hours by being available whenever a car drove down the road . Obviously , then , the decision to make our farm the center of all of our activities had to take into account our ability to deal with a less private and reclusive life . The alternatives , as we saw them , included sending our produce and products out , wholesaling , and opening a shop in a community with enough population to support us . None of those options really appealed to us . Thus far , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customers primarily in one place , despite the compromises to our privacy . Ultimately , we have answered the question that Mark asked 142 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE back in 1983 , and in the process we have discovered that one of us will probably always be asking that question . It will reappear whenever we are feeling discouraged , tired , or disappointed . But we have also discovered that we are committed to farming the land , to learning , and to making our business support us . We have been made more confident by our small successes , chastened by our equal number of failures , and strengthened by our ability to adapt and change . I think we have begun to take ourselves and our goals more seriously . 8 ? THE BUSINESS OF FARMING WHEN WE FIRST THOUGHT about moving to Maine , and for a few years after our actual arrival , we tried to make a neat distinction between our urban and rural selves . We imagined that the new skills we were learning would be more relevant to our lives than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , learning about the land , about growing vegetables , building buildings , raising animals , and becoming more self-reliant preoccupied and delighted us for a number of years . As the farm evolved into a series of different activities , though , we began to appreciate that we were trying to define a diversified business . We also began to appreciate that we had no business or management skills , no education in financial planning , no background in the administration of a staff , and no training in product development ? and our marketing efforts were simply adopted from what we had observed in our various workplaces in the city . 144 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE The distinction we had tried to make between urban and rural skills became less clear as we began to take ourselves and our goals more seriously . We realized that we would have to draw on all of our capabilities , past and present , and try to use whatever skills we had if we wanted to make our farm sustain us . We had learned to work the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a living off the land . The work of transforming a personal undertaking into a company was difficult , and the process often made us feel quite selfconscious . That was nowhere more apparent than in our need to name the farm . Naming a special private retreat is about as difficult as naming a child . You run the gamut of names ? arty , alliterative , cute , tasteful , respectably dull , embarrassing , or simply unacceptable to one or the other partner . When we were naming the farm , nothing felt right , mostly because adopting a name symbolized an uncomfortable transition . After much equivocating , we agreed to take our name from the earliest topographic maps , which called our little mountain Hedgehog Hill . The woods around here are full of porcupines , and the earliest settlers to these parts , having come primarily from Europe , used the word hedgehog to describe these animals . ( Actually , the European hedgehog and the American porcupine are quite dissimilar in size and shape , but they both possess hundreds of sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills with the same name all over New England . Around the turn of the century , spring water was discovered on our Hedgehog Hill and a bottling company was built . Like us , the company owners had to go through the process of finding a name for their business . They apparently saw the folly in trying to sell Hedgehog Hill water , so they renamed the land Mount Oxford ? a solid and respectable-sounding name for a mound of land rising only eight hundred feet above sea level . Mount Oxford was much too respectable for us , so we went back to the old name . It was a choice that turned out to be a mixed blessing . It was a great name when it came to designing // our business 's printed materials . I found a wonderful woodblock of a hedgehog in a seventeenth-century history of four-footed beasts , and adapted the print for our farm logo . Hedgehog Hill is , however , a lousy name for people to say or spell , and whenever someone tries to repeat it , he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we painted and hung our first proper sign at the end of the road , friends took pictures of us standing at either end of the sign and grinning rather sheepishly at the camera . The sign seemed so big ( which it was not ) , so bold , so definitive as a statement of our entrance into the business world . In fact , it has taken me several years to begin not to notice the sign when I drive down our road . Apparently it struck a number of our friends that same way , because several of them commented on it , saying that they were stunned to see that we had named the farm and were actually running a business from our land . That reaction , I think , reveals some very deep-seated and romantic notions that we all hold about what farm life is all about . Those ideas preclude the need of farms to be managed , developed , and marketed according to the rules that govern every other business . We were face to face with that need , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets and with wholesale buyers , we had nevertheless to continue to keep in contact with a clientele for our business . We felt that our best strategy would be to use seedling and workshop catalogues , a catalogue of gifts from the farm , some selectively purchased advertising , and whatever editorial attention we could continue to attract . We started producing a number of printed pieces each year , which led one printing company to refer to us as the publishing tarmers . I guess we did look a little out of character in our overalls and mud boots , correcting galleys and page proofs in the printers ' customer booth . But we were confident that using our skills in writing , photographing , and designing printed materials would hr the best way to maintain contact with our clientele . We got 146 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE some early support for this idea : people told us that they looked forward to the publications , and in fact sometimes quoted back some of our writing . As I have mentioned , we methodically gathered a mailing list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred names to several thousand . As of this writing , the list is creeping toward the ten thousand mark . Given the fact that we have been compiling it for more than a decade and a half , I admit that our business is growing slowly , if you evaluate it from a traditional mail-order standpoint ; but our names are primarily those of people with whom we have actually had some contact . We have never swelled our mailing list by buying names from other companies , as is commonly done when young businesses are starting up . It means that our growth has been slower and more deliberate , and perhaps more cautious , but it has also meant that the returns for many of our mailings have been above average . When we send out a catalogue for seedlings , we know that a large number of our customers are interested in purchasing plants from us , because they have done so in the past or they have personally expressed interest in doing so . When we send out catalogues on the workshops or special events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have visited in the past or who have been referred to us . Over the years we have kept records of how many pieces we have mailed and how many responses we have had , so that we can evaluate the costs of the mailing , the rate of return , and the increase in response from year to year . From the beginning we have relied on our abilities to write material for ourselves , design our own brochures , and do our own photography ? all things that we could not afford to hire . I knew how to find paper and printers , and we have our own darkroom in the cellar of the house and can prepare materials there for publication . When it came to purchasing advertising , we decided to run ads fairly frequently in only a few publications , on the assumption that we could not spend much money on newspaper advertising and would probably do better by concentrating on // one audience over a period of time . I think that the approach makes sense , as we constantly hear people saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ? what they are remembering is seeing our ads repeatedly in one weekly Maine newspaper , and very occasionally in some local weeklies , which we use before the spring fair and the November open house in our farm shop . Although the actual design and production of printed materials has not been difficult for Mark and me , the management of a small direct-mail business was at first fraught with problems and frustrations . We did not know anything about the ins and outs of the U.S. Post Office . We had to learn about buying a bulk-rate permit so that we could mail out large amounts of printed matter for less than first-class rates . We had to learn to adjust the sizes and weights of our mailing pieces so that they would fall within the limitations for the most economical postage rates . We had to learn how to label , sort , count , and weigh our mailings to comply with postal regulations . We had to learn how to phrase the mailing piece with the correct " Forwarding and Return Postage Guaranteed/Address Correction Requested " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away when we wanted address changes to keep our lists up to date . As a consequence of all this , I strongly suggest that anyone who is starting a business try to schedule some time with a postal administrator before designing any printed material . If we had done this early on , we would have avoided a number of costly mistakes . You should ask questions about the best types of mailers for your business and the size and weight limitations , and once you have gathered as much information as possible , remember to ask the same questions again from time to time . Like most government agencies , the post office is constantly revising its regulations , and unless you ask the same questions every few months , you may find that you are designing a mailer that violates some new rules . You should also be aware of upcoming postal rate increases , so you can send out pieces a month or two 148 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE earlier than you might have planned in order to take advantage of the savings . Although Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , we did n't have the experience to evaluate the effectiveness of some of our efforts . Our seedling and workshop catalogues were fairly well conceived and successful from the beginning . Our gift catalogue was not as well thought out . The first one that we designed , printed , and mailed offered only three different items for sale : an everlasting bouquet , an herbal wreath , and a heart-shaped arrangement of dried flowers . The cost of producing the catalogue and sending it out was barely offset by the gifts that we sold . It was not a disastrous opening gambit , but with hindsight , I realize that you can not begin a catalogue business with only three items for sale . The second year we increased our line of gifts by offering three times as many items ? still a small number ? and again we did very little more than cover the cost of putting out the publication . We tried to interpret our returns in the best way possible , by telling ourselves that even if we had n't made any profit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . While that is no doubt true , perhaps there were better ways to do that . It is always hard to judge the success of any piece of advertising , especially in the first years of business . We now know , however , that we need to offer a much more extensive list of products from the farm and to represent our gifts with a full-color catalogue . But in order to do that , we must develop more products that we feel are good quality , interesting , and reasonable to produce with the materials and staff that we have . They should also be products that we will want to go on manufacturing , because once they are offered in a catalogue , they should be available for a while to come . The time that it takes to design , develop , refine , and present a new product is considerable . When we were growing vegetables for a living , adding a new item simply meant ordering seed , planting , harvesting , and filling another display box at the farmers ' // market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a retail shop or to wholesale buyers is not so simple . There are questions of design appeal , pricing , packaging , and the ability of the product to be shipped , and then there are questions about our ability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities for retail , wholesale , or catalogue supply . It is quite easy now to rattle off all of these concerns , but we had to learn to define the problems of any new idea and to develop new ideas systematically . As we did , we began to appreciate the realities and constraints of a small manufacturer . Ideas come quickly ; the ability to translate ideas into real products is much more difficult . I can illustrate this most clearly by describing the development of one of our main products ? the herbal wreath . As I have explained , I made my first wreath during a talk and demonstration . The farm has since sold thousands of herbal wreaths , at our shop , at craft fairs , through our gift catalogues , and in boutiques all across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first effort to producing a consistently good product by the thousands is the story of each individual item that we try to define and add to our business . As I have pointed out , we originally made our wreaths on crimped wire frames that we fashioned by bending and shaping old coathangers . Once we began to make more and more wreaths , it was not possible to make our own frames too , so we had to find a manufacturer that produced them ? and the tape and the wires and the floral picks , supplies that are necessary to produce a well-made , long-lasting wreath . In addition , we had to rethink our scale of farming to be sure that we raised enough materials to put into the wreaths . This meant reorganizing both our annual and perennial plantings and scheduling enough days in every growing season for gathering materials in the wild . If we were going to have a regular selection of wreaths available in the shop , then we had to plan ahead to have enough raw materials and enough time to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the actual manufacturing myself , 150 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE and when my mother 's help was not enough for us to keep up , we had to look for and train another person . That meant more money in labor costs . It also meant that we had to forecast not only the increased need for raw materials but the manufacturing needs over a year , so that the new staff person would have some definition of his or her workload and expected income for a season . We had to decide on a fair wage that was attractive enough to hold someone we had hired and spent time training . We also had to include another person at the farm , which added to our costs for workman 's compensation ( a legal area we had to learn about once the farm grew beyond the limits of a family workplace ) Then , with the costs of materials , supplies , and labor settled , we had to determine how much money we would charge for each wreath . This figure would have to reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious costs , including those parts of the farm 's budget that went for advertising the product , maintaining the buildings for manufacture and selling , storing materials , and packaging , labeling , and holding the item as inventory between manufacture and selling . The list of considerations goes on . It would be quite simple if a customer were content to drive to our shop , select an herbal wreath , and carry it out in a leftover grocery bag . Obviously , a wreath is not a pound of tomatoes , and the customer expects a box to protect it . That means that we had to hunt for manufacturers of suitable cardboard boxes . At first we chose corrugated containers for their durability . We then had to find suppliers of tissue paper for wrapping the wreaths inside the boxes . We had to design a label with the name of our company , ideally with an attractive logo and something about the wreath 's design and manufacture , to take advantage of the fact that we grew our own materials and used only natural herbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to box our wreaths safely , we were faced with the fact that our customers wanted to give the wreaths as gifts and had begun to ask whether we had anyTHE // thing more attractive than a brown cardboard box . It seemed a reasonable request , but it meant that we had to find a gift-box manufacturer to design wreath boxes in a couple of sizes , and we had to work with the manufacturer to figure out the specifications we needed . Then we had to figure the cost of the packaging into the cost of the herbal wreath . We also had to make certain that we always had enough boxes on hand but never had too many manufactured ahead of time , which tied up our money in the costs of the boxes and of the space to store them . The same marshaling of inventory applies to the wreaths themselves and to the supplies that go into them and the labels they carry . Now , all of this pertains only to manufacturing wreaths for sale at the farm . Many of our customers visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped to them after they have returned home at the end of their summer vacation . Just as many customers want to send a wreath to someone as a gift , and they would like us to ship it for them . Naturally , all of the people who purchase wreaths through the mail must have their orders shipped to them , and all of our out-of-state wholesale buyers require this too , as do most of our in-state buyers . So we not only need individual wreath boxes , we need heavier shipping containers in various sizes , insulating material to protect our boxed wreaths , shipping labels , and an arrangement with a company to pick up and deliver our products . We also have to learn and abide by the rules and regulations of packaging and shipping used by the carrier . The considerations go on . If a customer simply walks into the shop and purchases a wreath and hands me a $50 bill , I give the appropriate change ( which I have to have on hand ) and write up a receipt for my books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write out a check , I have to have a policy about accepting checks . Once someone has established a retail shop , most customers expect him or her to accept at least a few of the major credit cards , and it does seem strongly to influence customers ' decisions to purchase something , especially if they are traveling 152 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE or on vacation . If you decide to accept any form of plastic money then you have to find a bank that is convenient to your business and that offers competitive rates for processing the credit slips . ( In looking around , be careful to compare the rates , because the difference between four percent and five percent can be a considerable amount over a year . ) Since Mark and I decided that taking credit cards stimulates buying , we have found a bank to handle the business and have got the proper forms to fill out and deposit ( in addition to regular bank deposits ) . If these endless details sound mundane , I can assure you that beginning to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never quite realized that we had opened a store until we were pressed by our customers to behave like store owners . Almost every procedure and policy we have had to develop came about because one of us did n't know how to respond to a buyer 's question . Do you ship wreaths to Germany ? How much would an arrangement cost if I had it done in my own antique basket ? Can I have the country hat on the far table , but with one more ribbon ? Will you accept my sister 's check ? Mark and I stumbled and ad-libbed through answers at first , but when some of the other people on our staff were confronted with such questions , they had to ask the customer to wait just a minute while they hunted for us to help them out , which made everybody unhappy . And so , over the years , we have spruced up our products and established some procedures and policies , and still not a week goes by without a perplexing question or two . ( In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one case a woman asked us whether she could bring in an everlasting arrangement she had bought from another store so that we could " fix it up a little " to make it look as nice as ours . In another , a man wrote from the Midwest to ask for copies of our financial statements ; he wanted to study them so he could revamp his failing nursery business into a business like ours , which he presumed took in several million dollars a year . ) After sifting through all these details simply to design , make , // and sell an herbal wreath , we had to decide on a retail price for every size and variation of the wreath , and also to determine a wholesale price list . The wholesale price must be high enough to justify our time and effort in making the product , but low enough to tolerate being doubled , since most items are marked up a hundred percent by the retailers . Wholesale accounts only come back for reorders if our products sell , and in an impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the owners , the wreaths from our farm will not get any more attention than any other item on display . The only criterion for continuing business is the ability of the product to sell itself . A lot of this explanation is filled with the lingo of manufacturing , pricing , selling , and packaging , because in the process of making that first wreath and trying to develop it as a product from Hedgehog Hill , we got an intensive education in the business of marketing . From the development of one product we were able to begin to ask more intelligent questions in each and every area of the herb and everlasting business , but each new product has presented a unique series of problems to be solved . Most broadly stated , we found our way into the larger world of manufacturers and suppliers . In many cases , we simply started out with the yellow pages of big-city telephone directories , beginning as close to home as possible but sometimes ending up in Boston , New York , or Chicago . The telephone was our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vinegars , to manufacturers of ribbons for decorating our everlasting nosegays and country hats , to distributors of envelopes for packaging herbal teas and potpourris When it came to packaging products , we not only had to solve the problem functionally and aesthetically , we had to learn how to do it legally . Food can be bottled only in new glass . Food labeling has to be specific and complete . Packages of food and dried herbs , according to Maine regulations , must not be assembled with any harmful materials . Food items have to be stored in 154 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE specific ways . All of the rules and regulations are reasonable , and they are designed to protect both manufacturer and consumer , but we had to learn what the rules were and to make certain that we were always in compliance . Home food manufacturing is typically under the jurisdiction of the state , and each state has its own licensing process , fee structure , and inspection program . In Maine , the Department of Agriculture oversees this activity . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well to contact your state agency first so that someone can help you plan . The direction that you will need is not unnecessarily cumbersome , but for us , at least , it was a long way from just having our produce scale checked each season at the farmers ' market . Moreover , like the constantly changing rules at the post office , regulations governing food manufacturing and packaging constantly change , and it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to keep apprised of the current laws . And manufacturing food at a farm often means , as it has meant for us , that you are subject to yearly inspections by a state agent , who checks your kitchen , water quality and temperature , cooking utensils , and preparation and storage procedures . In our case , the agent has always been helpful , and she is our best source of information about suppliers , code changes , and sometimes marketing trends . When we moved our farm business back to the farm itself , we changed our point of access to the public . Customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , and we became obliged to carry extended insurance for fire , personal liability , and product liability . The barn/shop that we designed and built is now inspected routinely for proper steps , railings , lighting , heating , water , and population usage . Our seedling and nursery business has also grown more complex , and in our attempts to manage this part of the farm , we began to learn about yet another industry . Typically , the earliest needs in any activity are for some simple supplies and information , and the greenhouse business was no exception . In order // to grow thousands of plants for sale , we had to know not only where to purchase seeds but where to get constant supplies of soil or soil mixes , containers , watering tools , and identifying labels for plants . Once again we had to search for suppliers in the industry , assess what materials we really needed , and figure out what effect these supplies would have on the costs of our plants . We also had to look at the existing standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in individual pots , in containers of six or twelve , then what would we do ? What proportion of plant to container would allow the plants to develop best and at the same time allow us to grow as many plants as possible in our greenhouse space ? If we were growing plants just for ourselves , then we would probably put each plant in its own container , with ample room for root development and light . However , in order to be cost-effective , each greenhouse had to be used to produce the optimum number of plants . Like any industry , the plant business is full of traditions and marketing tricks that we had to understand and interpret for ourselves . This was perhaps most obvious in growing and selling perennial seedlings for sale as first-year plants . Most nurseries offer perennials as individual plants , or as a small number of plants , for prices far above those of the common annual vegetables and flowers . Even when there is no difference in the cost of the seeds , and when it is just as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow annuals , the price of the perennial is markedly higher . This is the result not of the actual costs of materials and labor but of some perceived sense that people will not buy perennials each year , so the market will thus bear a higher asking price . Consumers have been trained to expect to pay more . In this case , we decided early on to offer flats of perennial seedlings , which no doubt caused some surprise among other growers . It also caused some surprise among our customers , because they told us repeatedly that they could not find the same plants anywhere else . Challenging the conventional wisdom in this case helped us to attract quite a few people to our farm . I56 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE We also had to evaluate this part of the farm 's activity in terms of the number of people it would take to manage the work for a given period of time . Unlike the herb and everlasting business , which can occupy us in some way year-round , the seedling business is limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between late fall of the previous season and early spring of the actual selling year . Fortunately , we kept records of our orders and sales from the beginning , so that we could try to project our needs for seeds and supplies and our start-up costs in the spring . We also became aware of the hazard of crop failures at the seed companies , so we now try to order the seeds that are most critical for seedling sales and field production early . Realizing that we are so reliant on seed companies has pressed us to search for varieties that are not hybrids and to collect our own seeds when possible . If a crop becomes important to our business , then we are most comfortable with relying on our own abilities to grow and save its seeds from season to season . This is all the more important because we decided to offer our seedlings earlier than most greenhouses by means of our spring catalogue . We have to write , produce , and mail the catalogue during the midwinter months ; thus we offer plants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds . Our customers expect to be able to receive all the plants they read about in the catalogue , and our credibility rests on our ability to deliver everything we offer . Our planning therefore has to be carefully controlled , not only for variety but for quality and quantity , so that on a given date ? when the plants go on sale ? we have thousands of seedlings of the appropriate kinds , developed to the right stage for sale . This calls for some analytical projection and not a modest amount of luck . Like our other activities , our seedling and plant business is subject to a number of regulations and demands . We must be licensed to sell plants , and our plants are inspected several times a year by an entomologist from the state Department of Agriculture . We have always benefited by his visit , as he has taken // a special interest in our attempts to raise greenhouse and field plants without the use of chemicals . He has taken unusual insects back to his laboratory to help us identify them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological pest controls , and he occasionally sends us reprints of material that he thinks might be of interest . Our experience with licensing agents and government inspectors has almost always been positive , but that has resulted from our attitude that their work is not punitive or personal . There are n't any regulations that I know of that I would not want applied to products I might buy . And the agents we have met are usually informed and sympathetic , if extremely overworked . I have heard other business owners grousing about the pressures they get from inspectors , but I am sure that the kind of relationships anyone is able to develop with the various government agents is very much governed by his or her attitudes about the nature of their work . Throughout all of the changes on our farm , the area that has remained the least complicated is the actual field production . Perhaps this is because we have had longer to define our size and the diversity of our crops . These definitions are not fixed , but they are proportioned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tasks of planting , cultivating , and harvesting . Each year we plan out our fields , to the point of drawing up a map before planting . We design the gardens to take into account the rotation of crops , the layout of the plants to be used in teaching , and the ease and efficiency of harvesting . We also lay them out with an overriding interest in the ultimate visual design , because we feel that we can , with not much more effort , design gardens that are beautiful places in which to study and work . The abilities that we have to understand how plants develop and to appreciate their times of flowering and fruiting and their relative sizes , shapes , and colors are perhaps some of the richest rewards of the years spent in learning . One of my favorite tasks in the spring is to take the previous 158 A SMALL FARM IN MAINE year 's garden plan and a clean sheet of paper and work up a new scheme for planting . I sketch out ideas , trying to juxtapose textures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fronts of the rows , leaving those that can develop for fall harvest at the far ends . I try to group families of plants , separating species by a repeating pattern . For instance , the brassica row usually starts with the earliest summer cabbage , then has a colorful annual flower , then early purple cabbage , then flowers again , then the winter storage cabbage , flowers , Chinese cabbage , flowers , broccoli , flowers , cauliflower , flowers , kale , flowers , Brussels sprouts , and flowers . It never even occurred to us when we began farming that we might want to plan the fields to be as beautiful as possible . Now I 'm as interested in the design of the gardens as I am in their function and productivity . The fields are laid out like complex tapestries , and in the past few years we have made and painted small wooden signs that identify each plant by its botanical and common names . We use the signs to educate ourselves , to teach everyone on the staff , to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage visitors to use the gardens as a place to browse . Not all parts of the organizing and management of our farm have been as enjoyable as the actual gardens . This is particularly true of bookkeeping and money management . We moved to Maine and farmed for a number of years using only our small personal checkbook . We kept records of all of our sales and purchases , but we simply stored them in desk drawers or in file cabinets until midwinter , when Mark had to pull all of the information together to prepare the tax forms . He usually procrastinated as long as possible and then hauled out all the papers , sorted them , and tried to assign them to categories of farm and personal expenses . The work was tedious and time-consuming . We read what we could find about itemizing expenses , capital investments , and depreciating purchases , in an attempt to report our income acTHE // curately and still pay no more in taxes than was necessary . We called our accountant in Boston with questions , some of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions about the business we were now in . The bookkeeping became increasingly cumbersome . We were taking in more and more money , but our expenses for supplies , equipment , building , wages , insurance , advertising , state and government taxes , and workman 's compensation were growing too . Our methods of bookkeeping in no way reflected the complexity of our business , and we had to learn to collect and organize data that we could analyze to make better decisions as well as to report our income accurately . Our small checkbook was abandoned in favor of a one-write bookkeeping system . The largest print on our checks was no longer our names but the name of the farm . All income and expenses are recorded and then broken out into the appropriate columns for accounting purposes . When we are disciplined ? or rather , when Mark is disciplined ? we work up a spread sheet every month , so we can review our financial picture and compare it with the previous year 's situation . Although teaching ourselves about and making ourselves work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting , the information we have been able to glean from the work has turned out to be essential . We can see how much money we have spent each season on each part of the farming enterprise . We can evaluate our cash flow from month to month . We can project what our wages might be for the upcoming season , and we can factor in a percentage increase in certain recurring costs . We are actually able to project income from the various activities more closely , and to interpret that information as we decide what aspects of the business we want to maintain , what aspects we want to develop , and what aspects we might consider abandoning . And as the record keeping improves , we are actually able to rely on our interpretations of the figures to plan budgets for an upcoming season . 16o A SMALL FARM IN MAINE I recall a seminar I attended years ago , on using computers in small businesses . The lecturer made one salient point : people buy computers not because they think they might need one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are already finding too cumbersome to do manually . Almost every aspect of our farm work mandated our buying a computer as a tool , and , as I mentioned earlier , when we purchased one , it quickly became as essential to our daily operations as the tractor and the telephone . It also became one more thing that we had to learn to understand and use . I have come reluctantly into the twenty-first century when it comes to accepting modern technology . Mark was the moving force in getting the computer , and although we have been using it for the past couple of years , I still am reluctant to struggle with any commands beyond my needs to write articles , brochures , and letters . And yet I am the first to admit that the capabilities that it gives us are invaluable . We store all of our plant information , our mailing lists , and labels for the brochures we send out every year . All of our bookkeeping is done with a spreadsheet program . We send out computer-generated letters regularly to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design and print simple labels for products when we are trying out new ideas and are not yet ready to commit ourselves to spending money for outside printing . As I consider all of these areas of concern , I realize that they have been uncommonly stimulating . I never expected our rural adventure to be so broad an education . And if I turn that realization around , I also have to reflect on the way in which we have evolved the farm into a place where the stimulus for involvement is the constant need to learn . There is another component of our rural education that we are only beginning to appreciate as the work here becomes more elaborate . We came out of the city with a strong determination to make a life for ourselves in the country , but we peopled that life with other participants , and in the process created a tiny
