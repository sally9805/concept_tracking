Thanks to John Baudouine , of Bullhead City , Ariz. ( pop . 15,000 ) , his town is now officially hotter than ever before . Baudouine , a fireman , is no sorcerer : for four years he has been in charge of reporting daily weather statistics to the National Weather Service for his stretch of western Arizona desert . Last April a stickler from the Weather Service told him to move his thermometer from the firehouse 's comparatively cool , sprinklered front lawn to more " natural terrain . " Baudouine picked a dusty patch 100 yards away , and the high temperatures in Bullhead City were promptly four or five degrees higher . On eight days last month , in fact , television weathermen announced that the town-with temperatures as high as 115 F - was the warmest spot in the U.S. <P> This has made some residents of Bullhead City hot under the collar . Dick Smith , who owns Dick and Lovella 's Five Grand Cafe , is leading a petition drive to move the thermometer back . Says Smith of the new publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off 20% to 30% . " But Baudouine is unapologetic . " This kind of notoriety is good for the community , " he says . Cooler heads among Bullhead City businessmen seem to agree . According to a membership survey by the Chamber of Commerce , 90% think the summer superlative is " good for business . "
