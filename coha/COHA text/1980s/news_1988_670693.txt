But there was a prerequisite : only blacks were invited to participate at the meeting. // " We make no apologies , " said Lu Palmer , a black political organizer who arranged the gathering . Unless blacks come together themselves , Mr. Palmer warned at the start of the meeting , " it could lead to the election of a white , and a reversal of everything we have strived so hard to attain. " // // Meeting Is Widely Condemned // In recent days , newspaper editorials and black leaders and white leaders alike here have condemned the meeting as a step backward for Chicago . The city ' s two leading black contenders for mayor did not attend. // The fact that the meeting was held at all underscored the racial anxiety that continues to afflict this city ' s politics as voters prepare to choose a successor to Harold Washington , Chicago ' s first black mayor. // Since Mr. Washington died last year of a heart attack , the city has been uneasily ruled by Eugene Sawyer , a black Alderman from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to be named Acting Mayor , but also made him the target of sharp criticism among some blacks. // Now , six months before the city is scheduled to hold a special mayoral primary and eight months before the general election , the city ' s black electorate remains sharply divided . Mr. Sawyer is one of at least three black candidates likely to be running . Some blacks are openly fearful that a split vote among rival factions could lead to the election of a white. // In the lobby of the Tabernacle Baptist Church , where today ' s meeting was held , volunteers sold T-shirts , baseball caps and buttons bearing the message , " Only One Black Mayoral Candidate. " // In an interview this week , Mr. Palmer said , " I don ' t believe in coalition politics . I ' m only dealing with the reality , and that is that race is the single major issue in life and politics in Chicago . " <> <> Blacks Leaders Are Split // Others , like the Rev. Willie Barrow , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Rev. Jesse Jackson , say that divisions among blacks are such that the mayoral election ought to be put off until 1991 , to allow to time for the wounds to heal. // " I have never seen our community so torn and so pulled apart as they are now , " said Ms. Barrow , who noted last week that she was supporting a lawsuit pending before the Illinois Supreme Court that seeks to postpone the election. // The court is to hear arguments next month on the lawsuit , which argues that Mr. Sawyer ought to complete the remainder of Mr. Washington ' s four-year term until the next regular election , in 1991. // Mr. Jackson has disagreed with Ms. Barrow , saying the election should not be postponed . But Ms. Barrow said that blacks in Chicago would do better to concentrate on electing a Democratic President this fall than warring over who will be the city ' s next Mayor. // Among Chicago ' s 3 million people , the population of blacks , about 42 percent , is only slightly larger than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Planning . Those of Hispanic descent make up about 18 percent. // The city ' s last white Mayor was Jane M. Byrne , whom Mr. Washington defeated in the 1983 Democratic primary . <> <> Racial Tension an Old Story // Racial tension is hardly new to politics in the nation ' s third largest city , perhaps the nation ' s most segregated . In first electing Mr. Washington five years ago , voters split largely along racial lines , with Mr. Washington narrowly defeating Bernard E. Epton , the virtually unknown Republican candidate whose electoral strength derived mostly from the fact that he was white. // But Mr. Washington won re-election more easily in 1987 , with a larger share of white support than he had four years earlier . At the time he died , he had begun to forge the kind of coalition that seemed to presage an era of relative political stability for Chicago. // Tension within the black electorate here began to appear within hours of Mr. Washington ' s death in November 1987 , and culminated a week later , when Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 19 in a tumultuous City Council meeting that lasted until 4 A.M. and was disrupted by protesters who jammed City Hall and the streets outside. // Mr. Sawyer ' s chief rival at the time was Timothy C. Evans , another black Alderman who was Mayor Washington ' s Council floor leader . His supporters accused Mr. Sawyer of selling out Mr. Washington ' s legacy . Although Mr. Sawyer has announced he will be a candidate in next February ' s Democratic primary , along with Danny K. Davis , another black Alderman , Mr. Evans has yet to formally declare. // So far no white candidates have announced they are running , but the name most mentioned for the Democratic primary is Richard M. Daley , the Cook County Prosecutor who is the son of the man who ruled the city ' s powerful Democratic machine until his death in 1976. // A nasty primary battle among Democrats could work to the advantage of Republicans .

" We fought much to hard to get our first black Mayor to lose the fifth floor now , " said Mr. Palmer , who is closely associated with Mr. Davis , the lone mayoral candidate to address the meeting. //
