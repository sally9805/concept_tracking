 | Gasoline prices defy gravity , despite a 45 percent fall in the price of crude oil since December . Regular unleaded , averaging $1.10 per gallon at self-service pumps , is down a mere 6 percent since December , says the Lundberg Letter , an industry bible . Publisher Dan Lundberg says service stations are beefing up their profit margins to cover vastly increased costs of rent and insurance . He 's right . The wholesale price of regular unleaded , at 50 cents a gallon , has dropped 35 cents since November , and retailers have not passed along much of it . Consumers take heart . Within a year , predicts Kurt Wulff of Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , buyers will be sensitive to lower prices . " Then , the refiners and retailers will compete away " those fat margins , he says . Frederick Leuffer , who follows oils for Cyrus J. Lawrence , Inc. , says the passthrough to motorists may occur even sooner ? in three to six months . Insists Leuffer : " Ultimately , competition will drive retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , $15 crude translates into unleaded regular for as little as 70 cents a gallon , self-service . Lundberg says America 's cheapest gasoline is now regular leaded in Louisville , at 81.9 cents . Not so easily answered is when and where the free fall in oil prices will end . The contract price for the benchmark U.S. crude closed under $15 a barrel on February 18 . Analyst William Randol at First Boston is betting that equilibrium will occur " in the low teens " by midyear , perhaps after a brief plunge below $10 a barrel . Tricks of a " star " broker What 23-year-old Leslie Howard Roberts allegedly did in South Florida was so simple ? and so frightening ? it ought to give every investor pause . 1 Roberts was the top-producing rookie broker for E. F. Hutton Group , managing his great uncle 's $30 million account . He is accused of falsifying the uncle 's address , intercepting confirmation and statements and sending bogus versions to the real address . Merrill Lynch recruited Roberts last November , and the scam continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client thought his account had grown to $55 million . Unknown to him , " churning " and bad investments had reduced it to $8 million . If two big brokerages could let this happen so easily to a major client , ought any investor to sleep calmly ? Hutton and Merrill Lynch both have huge " compliance " staffs that monitor brokers and trading . Branch managers at all brokerages are the first line of defense . Says a Smith Barney , Harris Upham manager : " If I see an account balance start dropping when the market is rising , I call the client myself to ask why . " Branch managers also send what they call " happiness letters " to clients with active accounts ; while seemingly thanking the client for the business , such letters are meant to smoke out complaints of mishandling by brokers . A smart manager looks especially closely at a broker who , like Roberts , works only a few big accounts . But brokerage executives concede that " star " brokers can intimidate all  | but the strongest-willed supervisors and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trail of suspicious trading . Sometimes it 's still a jungle out there . Insurance : Up , up and away If you run a business , serve on a corporate board , own a home or drive a car , the problems of property and casualty insurers are your problems , too . " We 're charging more , " says Chairman John Byrne of Fireman 's Fund , " but we 're still not charging enough . " Property-casualty firms racked up $5.5 billion in losses last year ? their worst record ever . They are taking Draconian steps to shore themselves up . One way is to increase reserves as a cushion against losses . Cigna made a $1.2 billion charge on profits to bolster reserves in late January . Continental followed with a $220 million chargeoff . More write-offs are expected . Rate increases this year could surprise even cynics . Analyst June Hoffer at Prudential-Bache Securities predicts that premiums for commercial policies will rise 30 to 70 percent . The cost of malpractice policies for doctors and liability protection for directors could double or triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 percent , and rates for homeowners ' policies by at least 4 percent . Insurers blame the mess on litigious lawyers and lenient courts . Lawyers and other critics point to overzealous rate cutting several years ago by insurers . Whatever , buyers of insurance are being socked . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports 14 percent of its members could n't renew their liability coverage last year . Lear Petroleum says four of its nine directors have quit since it lost coverage on them last fall . As many as 600 doctors in Massachusetts are refusing new patients to protest an average 62 percent jump in malpractice rates . Such complaints are apt to be repeated often during 1986 . Coke gulps Dr Pepper Less than a year ago , Coca-Cola shot itself in the foot by prematurely abandoning its 99-year-old Coke brand . Less than a month ago , PepsiCo moved within a hailing distance of Coca-Cola 's No. 1 position in soft drinks by agreeing to buy Seven-Up , third-biggest in the $22-billion-a-year industry . Weep no more for Coca-Cola . Its purchase of fourth-ranked Dr Pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company comfortably in first place , with about 46 percent of the soft-drink market . After merging with Seven-Up , Pepsi 's share will be 35 percent ? as far behind as it was before . " It 's extremely important to Coke to remain No. 1 , " noted analyst Emanuel Goldman of Montgomery Securities . Dr Pepper had been bought by its own executives and the investment firm of Forstmann Little &; Company in 1984 . Coca-Cola has worked on other fronts to get its house in order . Swallowing its pride , it brought back its old Coke formula alongside new Coke , and later added Cherry Coke . In late January , it agreed to merge its U.S. bottling operations with JTL Corporation , the nation 's largest Coke bottler . If consummated , this deal will give Coke more control over marketing . Herb , you ol ' nerd On the subject of taste buds , Burger King 's Herb has but a few more weeks left in TV commercials ? and good riddance , say some experts who watch the fast-food business . Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America who had n't tasted the Whopper . " Herb was a big disappointment to Burger King , " says Michael Culp , who has munched tons of burgers and fries as restaurant analyst for PrudentialBache Securities . " He did not strike a chord in consumers . I sense relative indifference . " One reason may be that some potential customers of Burger King see themselves personified in Herb as nerds and losers . Burger King spokeswoman Joyce Myers says Herb was not meant to insult noncustomers but to be a " lovable character through whom we can talk about our product . " Burger King 's business rose 7 percent in January from year-earlier levels . But Culp and others think the chain expected more from its $40 million campaign . Annals of enterprise Texaco submitted to a Texas court 320 reasons why an $11.1 billion judgment against it in favor of Pennzoil should be reversed and a new trial ordered . In a 5-minute session February 20 , Judge Solomon Casseb accepted none . Said Casseb : " The court is going to let the law takes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal by Texaco to a higher court . The award concerned a dispute over control of Getty Oil . THINGS TO WATCHRepublic-Northwest air merger . The Justice Department wants to delay the purchase of Republic Airlines by Northwest Airlines because of " significant competitive concerns . " Among other things , says Justice , the merged firm would control 80 percent of gates at the Minneapolis ? St. Paul airport . Ironically , Justice acted just as President Reagan asked Congress for changes in antitrust laws that would make mergers easier . " Business Week 1,000 . " Since 1955 Fortune has garnered publicity and extra advertising with its Fortune 500 survey of the biggest U.S. companies . This April , three days before the 1986 Fortune survey appears , Business Week will publish its own list ? the top 1,000 companies . " We 'll rank companies by market value , " says BW Publisher John Patten . He says this will put industrial and financial companies on an equal basis . Patten expects to sell at least 100 ad pages for the special edition . Fortune 's marketing director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere form of flattery . " The 1985 Fortune 500 issue had 138 more ad pages than the typical issue and grossed an extra $4.7 million . Singer 's machines . Singer Company wants to molt , and emerge minus the sewing machines on which its fortunes were first made 135 years ago . Actually , today the company 's earnings come almost entirely from aerospace electronics . Under consideration : Spinning off the sewing-machine arm to shareholders ; the new company would use the Singer name under license . some 82.8 billion closures in 1984 , worth about $4 billion . As the last Tylenol incident points up , not even the three barriers in which Johnson &; Johnson swaddled its product after seven similar deaths almost four years ago in Chicago produce a tamperproof package . " You can make it difficult for the nonexpert tamperer , but if someone is skilled with the right equipment , he can defeat some of these in ways difficult to detect , " says James Nolan , an official of Owens-Illinois , one of the nation 's largest packaging companies . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than capsules , other pharmaceutical companies are trying to find ways to seal the gelatin containers more securely . Because capsules often are essential to dispensing time-release medications and are preferred by many consumers , companies such as Eli Lilly are developing a visible gelatin band to hold the two parts of the capsule together . " If you try to separate one of these , you actually tear the capsule apart , " explains Ronald Williams , general manager of Lilly 's worldwide capsule operations . The firm hopes to apply its technology to all of its over-the-counter products this year . Sterling Drug , Inc. , already is using sound waves to spotweld seals on Panadol capsules . Food manufacturers are extremely vulnerable to contamination . Joseph Hotchkiss , a Cornell University professor , found in a 1984 study that " many food products , particularly in grocery stores ... can be opened and closed without any evidence . " The easiest targets , according to Hotchkiss : Beverages , such as fruit juices , and dairy products . Many manufacturers of goods from spices to salad dressings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plastic shrink-wrap surrounds ice cream and cottage cheese . Plastic tops that break away and leave a ring at the neck cap soft-drink bottles . Pill bottles are enclosed in cans with pull-up tabs . Alcoa , one of the world 's largest producers of closures , predicts that all food companies will secure their packages by 1988 . Whatever steps manufacturers take to protect their products and customers ? taking capsules out of consumers ' reach , stepping up security in plants and retail outlets or dreaming up even more-invincible packages ? there seem to be no guarantees that determined tamperers can be kept at bay . Says Johnson &; Johnson Chairman Burke : " Nothing is 100 percent foolproof. " by Cindy Skrzycki with Dan Collins and Manuel Schiffres c NFWS R. Wr7Rl D RFPfRT Marnh 3 1986 PRODUCT TAMPERING INTERVIEW Johnson &; Johnson 's Chairman James Burke People ! understand the odds ' Q Mr. Burke , how big a threat to consumers is product sabotage ? Not very big . If you look at this country and its ability to move masses of merchandise on free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had . People do n't like it , and it 's one more anxiety-producing part of their lives , but they understand the odds . About 3 billion capsules of all sorts have been sold since Chicago ; this is the first incident . It is still the safest system in the world . Q How did you decide to pull the capsules off the market ? First we dealt with the public-safety issue by getting the capsules removed from store shelves and alerting consumers to the potential dangers . Then we examined our options . Capsules are 30 percent of a very big business , and our research showed that people did n't want to give them up . We considered whether we should announce a recall and come back with a better capsule and better packaging . But that could n't stop tampering ; it would just inhibit it . Q Did you consider other factors ? We looked at the best possible scenario that could emerge from the Westchester. situation ? everything gets cleared up and there 's no problem elsewhere . Did it make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , the answer was probably yes . We could save at least half our capsule business . However , from the safety standpoint , probably no , because if somebody wants to tamper again , they could , and we have n't seen any capsule technology that can prevent it . Also , we had been having great success with the " caplet " ? the capsule-shaped tablet . Our research showed that the great majority of the capsule users would be willing to switch . We decided we ought to face the music and get out . Q Are you sure the " caplets " ca n't be adulterated ? No , you ca n't be sure . I ca n't say it wo n't happen , but I think it 's about as tamperproof as you can make a tablet . Q Many people die in crashes , yet there 's little demand that auto makers stop making cars . Why did you feel compelled to take such radical action ? Because we could see public confidence beginning to erode again and because the hysteria of Chicago was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refueled by this story . We did n't see how the reputation of , first , Tylenol and , more important perhaps , Johnson &; Johnson could survive . Q You 've called placing poison in Tylenol capsules " an act of terrorism . " Why did you use such harsh words ? It was an act of terror in the sense that we do n't know where else it will take place . It 's just as when terrorists mow down people in an airport . We do n't know when or where they might strike again . Q Do you feel it 's a company 's responsibility only to sell products that can not be sabotaged ? No . There 's no way to do it . If you could , nobody could afford to buy the products anyway . Q Do you know what the motives were in either 1982 or the recent case ? No . In fact , I think we 'll find the motives in both cases very different . They could be extremely venal ; they may be financial . Q What can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing that is n't being done already . You could take capsules and put them behind the counter under the jurisdiction of the pharmacist . That would mean they would be more expensive , and you 'd be depriving consumers of easy access to medications they find highly satisfactory . Whether that 's worth doing is a question the industry has to decide , along with the government .
