Adolfo Prez Esquivel , 48 , is a quiet , slightly built Argentine whose shy smile and modest appearance belie an iron resolve : he is a dedicated champion of Latin America 's poor and oppressed , and , by proxy , of Argentina 's 6,000 desaparecidos- " those who disappeared , " most either kidnaped or liquidated in the Argentine military 's harsh , four-year-long antiterrorism drive . As such , Prez Esquivel is an avowed nonviolent foe of the ruling junta in Buenos Aires . As a result of last week 's Nobel honors , he is now , irony of ironies , on the payroll of a government he has long opposed . Under an obscure law passed in 1977 , probably in the belief that the country 's greatest author , Jorge Luis Borges , might win the Nobel Prize for Literature , any living Argentine laureate receives the salary of a supreme court justice , or about $5,000 a month , in addition to the cash award given by the Nobel Foundation . Last week , to the public displeasure of the junta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobel Prize for Peace . <P> The Peace Prize committee chose Prez Esquivel from a record list of 71 nominees . Although virtually unknown outside human rights circles , he edged out such candidates as President Jimmy Carter ( for his Camp David efforts ) , British Foreign Minister Lord Carrington and Zimbabwe Prime Minister Robert Mugabe ( for their successful endeavor to end the war in Rhodesia ) , Swedish Disarmament Activist Alva Myrdal and Pope John Paul II . Prez Esquivel , said 1976 Peace Laureate Betty Williams of the Northern Ireland Peace Movement , is " the greatest living radical pacifist leader . " Noted the Nobel committee : " He is among those Argentines who have shone a light in the darkness . He champions a solution that dispenses with the use of violence . The views he represents carry a vital message to many other countries , not least in Latin America . " <P> The message Prez Esquivel preaches is simple . A devout Roman Catholic , a sculptor and onetime professor of art and art history , he gave up his academic career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Peace and Justice Service ) . The group is dedicated to human rights throughout Latin America and to what Pe&gt;ez Esquivel describes as " both spiritual and moral support , and practical aid for those who suffer . " Specifically , that means organizing help for the needy in the continent 's sprawling slums and its impoverished countryside . A disciple of Mahatma Gandhi , Prez Esquivel also formed groups dedicated to nonviolent social change . The distinction was too subtle for the military government in Argentina . In 1977 he was arrested , tortured and held in custody for 14 months without ever being charged . <P> Though Prez Esquivel is only the second Argentine ever to win the Peace Prize ( the first was Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas in 1936 for having settled the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay ) , the reaction of the junta was singularly graceless . Claiming that the award had " taken the country by surprise , " the military leadership charged that Prez Esquivel 's activities " were effectively used , regardless of his intentions , to make the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
