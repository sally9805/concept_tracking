THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : I am sitting at ease thirty or forty thousand feet above the earth and travelling at a speed undreamed of hardly a generation ago . Leaning a little to left , I look down through a sky of intense blue to an infinity of snow and ice and thrusting peaks of naked rock . It is a view , a vision , an experience unimaginable not much more than a generation ago , and it lies open to my idlest glance . I lean back and cut myself another pink-andcharcoal bite of filet mignon . I take another sip of Cabernet Sauvignon . And all the while , through the gift of a dozen electronic miracles inconceivable at the turn of the century , I am listening to the glory of Bach 's " Italian Concerto , " played by a French pianist now dead . A line of Andrew Marvell comes pleasingly to mind : " What wond'rous life is this I lead ! " I think of Marvell 's wonders  --  his luscious clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , smiling , of mine . I think  --  and then I realize . I catch myself . I feel a flush of embarrassment , almost of shame . This is n't wond'rous . It ca n't be wond'rous . I am in an airplane , a 707 , a flying bus , en route to Los Angeles , and nothing could be more uncomfortable , more commonplace , more boring . I lie back in my seat and close my eyes . I can feel my heart pounding . It has been the narrowest of narrow escapes . T N political theory , a distinction is I- often drawn between liberation ( the overthrow of a repressive regime ) and the establishment of liberty ( the foundation of a lawful regime that respects the rights of its people ) . The point is made that all too frequently liberation goes unaccompanied by liberty , and the old repressions are resumed , or even increased , under a new set of masters . Events in Poland in recent months have reversed this classic sequence . Not only are the Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberation . If they succeed , it will be as though the French Revolution had somehow taken place with Louis XVI left on the throne . Violent insurrection can not be their course , because they know that , owing to their geographical position at the heart of the Communist bloc , the Soviet Union would invade their country if they brought down the Communist regime . So the Polish people , organized for collective action by Solidarity , the national federation of independent unions , have chosen to let the government remain in place , and to attain their liberties one by one , in the teeth of official opposition , through militant but peaceful social action of a kind that may be unique in political history . Their field of action , on which not a shot has been fired , is not the battlefield , or even the wood or the back alley of the guerrilla fighter , but the arena of daily life : the shop floor , the shipyard , the office , the university , the newspaper , the movie theatre . Above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regional or national strike  --  a means that by its very nature can not be resorted to without the full support of the public . And as the people have regained control of their lives from the authorities , there has been a burst of civic energy and activity , which , in turn , has contributed new strength to the movement . All the while , the authorities , backed by the Soviet Union , have portrayed the movement as an outbreak of " anarchy " and disorder , but it would be more accurate to say that as people begin to go about the ordinary business of their lives without government interference and repression , a previously disorganized and disorderly Poland is experiencing an outbreak of stability and order . Of course , all of it can be lost if the ultimate destabilizing force  --  the Soviet Union  --  steps in . So far , however , the Soviets , faced with the determined , ebullient spirit of the Poles , and with the spontaneous sympathy it has evoked around the world , have held back . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way , startling . Freedom itself has been placed in a new light . It seems to be a peculiarity of freedom that it quickly becomes invisible to those who , like us , are in possession of it . When we do think about it , we tend to regard it as something abstract  --  as a " principle " written down somewhere in a book or a document , or as an " ideal " floating somewhere high above our daily activities . The Poles , fighting for it inch by inch , have shown it to be more mundane , more concrete , and more important than it usually seems to us . Each day , we do scores of things that the Poles are risking their lives to be able to do : we read an uncensored newspaper , we make an untapped telephone call , we meet with anyone it pleases us to meet with , we attend a class , we present our employer with a grievance , we air our disgust with some governmental action , and we do all this without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogated , and thrown into jail for an indefinite period . Perhaps it is precisely because freedom is such a basic good  --  so natural to human life  --  that its presence , like the air we breathe , is scarcely noticed until it is taken away . Whatever the reason , the Poles , by fighting , at such high cost to themselves , to regain their freedom , have offered us a chance to rediscover the meaning of our own . Anna , Pete Louisa , and Mike WITH all the former hostages in Iran back in their homes around the U.S.A. , we looked in on Mr. and Mrs. Moorhead C. Kennedy , Sr. , Manhattan 's only hostage parents . Moorhead C. Kennedy , Jr. , who lives in Washington , D.C. ? with his wife , Louisa , who coordinated the efforts of the hostage families throughout the cIiff-hanging four hundred and forty-four days and served as their spokeswoman  --  had been the economics officer on temporary duty at the American Embassy in Teheran when the Iranian students took over , on November 4 , 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Air Force parka that was given to him on the plane from Algiers before the landing in Frankfurt  --  riding with Mayor Koch in New York 's ticker-tape parade . The senior Kennedys  --  he is seventy-nine and she is seventy-three  --  live in a cozy , high perch on upper Fifth Avenue , and we saw them there the other day , in their sunny , book-lined , newspaper-strewn , flower-filled study overlooking Central Park 's Reservoir and a good part of the surrounding territory . They are a tall , attractive , invincibly gracious , and unconcealably elegant couple , with exemplary posture , firm steps , clear eyes , splendid diction , terrific energy , strong purpose , engaging manners , and downright charm . At the outset , lie , wearing a dark-gray suit with vest and a Knickerbocker Club tie , and she , wearing a blue-green soft wool dress and black leather pumps , let it be known that we were to address him as Pete and her as Anna . " I have n't had a minute to straighten up the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grandsons sleeping all over the floor . The phone keeps ringing . Flowers keep coming , and the newspapers continue to pile FEBRUARY 23,1981 up . Pete has kept everything since November 4 , 1979 . As you see , we have pictures of Mike all over the room  --  and pictures of our daughter , Maisie , and our other son , Sandy , and all our grandchildren . And we have all their letters , and all Mike 's letters from Iran , and letters from people I have n't seen in forty years . I have letters from everybody I 've ever known . It 's been wonderful . I did n't shed a tear for four hundred and forty-four days . I never cried . Since January 20th , I have n't stopped crying . " She gave one quick blink . " And in the middle of all the excitement , right after the Mayor 's big parade , I had to answer all the telephone calls , because Pete was trying to do his income tax . " Mr. Kennedy tugged at the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Fortunately , I 've been able to take sortie time off from work , " Mrs. Kennedy went on . " I teach at P.S. 171 , on East One Hundred and Third Street . I 'm a school volunteer . I 've been teaching for years . I enjoy it enormously . I 'm one of the original school volunteers . There were only twenty of us in 1956 . Now there are ten thousand volunteers , all over the city . I teach reading and literature to fifth graders , on a one-to-one basis , and I work with four extremely brilliant sixth graders Jeanelle , Yvette , Lourdes , and Tiease  --  all of whom are reading almost at eleventh-grade level , or better . Miss Mann is the principal . She 's absolutely outstanding . When she first came into the job , three years ago , only twenty-eight per cent of the children were reading at grade level , and now the figure is up to sixty-four per cent . I ca n't wait to get back to these children , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released . Fortunately , Miss Mann says I can come back any time I 'm ready . " " She wo n't stop , " Mr. Kennedy said , throwing his wife an almost unnoticeable look of admiration . " The children put up a picture of Mike in the classroom , and they sent me the most wonderful THE NEW YORKER letters about him , " Mrs. Kennedy said . " I love working with those children . Before P.S. 171 , I taught at a private school  --  St. Bernard 's , on East Ninety-eighth Street . For years , I worked as assistant director to Miss Edith King and Miss Dorothy Coit , who ran the King-Coit Children 's Theatre .

I was there as a parent . A worshipping parent . I 've also taught  --  English and composition  --  at the Professional Children 's School , and in 1959 I started the New York Children 's Theatre , owned and directed by myself , where we put on a show every spring . We had a fourteen-year-old musical director , who stayed with me until he was nineteen , and his name was Marvin Handisch . " Mrs. Kennedy delivered the line like a pro . " I 've always loved the theatre , " she went on . " I 've had so many friends in the theatre . Cyril Ritchard . Millie Dunnock . Ethel Barrymore . My Sandy played the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' The King and I. ' He and Gertie introduced the song ' I Whistle a Happy Tune . ' They had the most beautiful two years together . He was president of the Triangle Club at Princeton , and he took its show across the country and to Europe . He did summer stock and studied with Sanford Meisner and Philip Burton , but then he decided to become a banker . He 's now a vice-president of Morgan Guaranty in Milan . Mike never wanted to be in the theatre . When he was a little boy , he absolutely refused to join the KingCoit Theatre . He did n't want to act . He said he 'd rather he dead . " ? ? Mr. Kennedy , who is a retired banker and a former president and current director of Goodwill Industries of Greater New York , gave a restrained nod of punctuation to the remark , and Mrs. Kennedy laughed . " Why the names Mike and Pete ? " we asked . " Based on what ? " " Well , you ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That 's when I started being called Pete . And Mike 's son Moorhead C. Kennedy III is called Mark . " We asked for a brief genealogical rundown , and Mr. Kennedy replied affably that his grandfather Thomas B. Kennedy had led a wagon train the Iron City Rangers  --  from Pittsburgh to California in 1849 , and then , having studied law , decided that the legal life would be better than digging for gold . He returned to Pennsylvania , married a Riddle who had a Moorhead in the family , built a large , beautiful house in Chambershurg , which was burned down by the Confederate troops in the Civil War , and became president of the Cumberland Valley Railroad . The first Moorhead C. Kennedy , born in 1862 , went to Andover ( Class of 1880 ) and to Princeton ( Class of 1884 ) , where he played on the football team , and later became vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad . The Moorhead C. Kennedy we were interviewing was born in 1902 , went to Princeton ( Class of 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went into investment banking . lie and Mrs. Kennedy were married in 1929 . Mrs. Kennedy told us that she was born in Bar Harbor , Maine , at her family 's summer home . She went to the Shipley School and to Bryn Mawr . Her paternal grandfather , Thomas A. Scott , who was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad , was in charge , as Assistant Secretary of War under Abraham Lincoln , of all transportation for the Union Army . Scott 's secretary , a young , red-headed immigrant boy from Scotland , who was known as " Scott 's little Scotch devil , " told Scott that he was quitting the railroad business in order to go into the steel business , and his name , Mrs. Kennedy said , with just the right dramatic pause , was Andrew Carnegie . Mary Cassatt , the painter , was a first cousin of Mrs. Kennedy 's paternal grandmother , who , when she visited Europe , was steered by Mary Cassatt toward buying paintings by Degas and Manet . When Mrs. Kennedy was fourteen , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the two girls embarked on a program of studying for the French theatre , with the serious aim of eventually joining the Comedie-Francaise . The Kennedys had four children : Moorhead C. , Jr. , now fifty ; Mary , known as Maisie , a banker in Philadelphia , forty-eight ; Alexander , or Sandy , the banker in Milan , forty ; and Peggy , who was born in 1938 and died at the age of eighteen . There are eight Kennedy grandchildren  --  including four sons of Mike and Louisa  --  and a great-grandchild is expected next month , to be born to Maisie 's son Richard Storey , Jr. , and his wife , Diana Mei , from Taiwan . " We 're a very close family , " Mrs. Kennedy said . " All my children spent their summers with my mother in Bar Harbor . My parents first went there in 1870 . I am repeating that pattern with my grandchildren . All the babies were christened at our house  --  Lilac Hill , at Northeast Harbor  --  in my garden , wearing my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother , in 1899 . The Reverend Palfrey Perkins married us there , and christened all our children and all our grandchildren there . Mike got to he a marvellous sailor at Northeast Harbor . He has cups all over the house . But his passion is the mountains on our little island . He loves climbing those mountains . He knows every bit of ground every mountain , every view . He loves those woods . Mostly , he goes alone . But he and I climbed together in the late summer of 1979 , just before he left for Iran . I said , ' But , Mike , that 's a crazy country to go to . ' He was supposed to be working in Washington , and he said he 'd surely be home for Christmas . He is utterly without fear . He was always a wonderful scholar . He 'd been reading everything since he was five years old . At Groton , he was the editor-in-chief of The Grolanian . When he was fifteen , he announced to us , ' I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the Middle East . ' At Princeton , he majored in Arabic and Oriental studies , graduating magna cum laude in 1952 . He studied Islamic law at Harvard Law School . He was in the Army from 1952 to 1954 , stationed in France and in Germany . The night he came home , I said , Let 's go to the Livingstons ' for cocktails . ' He was reluctant , but he went . When we arrived , there in the corner was this beautiful creature in a black dress . It was Louisa . She 's a brilliant , brilliant girl , and such a good sport . One'of her ancestors , Philip Livingston , signed the Declaration of Independence , and another helped write it . She went to the Brearley School , then to Ethel Walker , and to Sarah Lawrence , but she left after her junior year in order to marry Mike . An hour or so after the seizure of the Embassy , Louisa went to the State Department and joined the regular staffers , who at that point were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the compound , and she 's been helping ever since . The last night of the negotiations , she slept on a cot in the Operations Center at the State Department . She is a heroine , a most remarkable person . She went to Yemen to join Mike and took their first two sons , Mark and Philip , at the ages of three and one and a half . She had just given birth to Andrew , who could n't go to Yemen until he had had all his shots , so he was our baby for a year . Pete and I took care of him . In Yemen , she had hepatitis for a long time . Then , one day , she took the boys for a walk to a town square , where they saw men kneeling , and the men were being beheaded . After that , they were always on the move  --  children , dogs , the whole household . Athens , Beirut  --  from which they were evacuated during the 1967 crisis . Washington for a few years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do they do it ? " we asked . " Go through all that ? " The Kennedys looked at each other for an instant , and then Mr. Kennedy , with a small smile , nodded to his wife . " It 's an adventure , " Mrs. Kennedy said . " Mike and Louisa would tell you they 've always looked at life as an adventure . Mike , you know , is a deeply religious man . He read the Lesson for the ex-hostages at the Na-tional Cathedral . He read from the Book of Acts , Chapter XII , about Pe-ter 's leaving prison . During Lent , he 's been invited to preach here , at the Cathedral of St. John . In Iran , after last April 24th ? after the military-fiasco attempt to rescue the hos-tages  --  everyt h log got rough . Mike was moved immediately to the south , to Isfahan , and then he was moved back to Tehe-ran and put in Komiteh Prison . lie told us he was fed adequately and was not physically abused . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return , he looked as if he 'd just left the house , with his dimples and rosy cheeks . The government had put us up at this nifty hotel , and I was in my room when I heard his voice in the corridor . Well , I 'd been hearing his voice for over a year , but this time it was 3 I " Le Car keys , s'il VOUS ldit ! " real , and there he was , looking as if he 'd never gone away . " " He wrote a book while he was a hostage , " Mr. Kennedy said . " But it was taken , with all his luggage , by the Iranians the day the hostages left . Mike says there 's a chance they might get their socks and underwear back , and maybe the Iranians will throw in the manuscript . " Mrs. Kennedy looked through a sheaf of letters about eight inches high . " Mike wrote us so many wonderful letters , " she said . " On January 4 , 1980 , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does well if he does the will of the community , and not his own will . ' Then he asked Mark , But what is the will of the community ? Is it the will of my employer ? If so , then my employer has landed me in the most awkward predicament . ' That 's as close as Mike came to telling us that he was a little bit unhappy . He was obviously concerned about the way the Embassy had been left to absorb the rage of the students , following our government 's decision to give asylum to the Shah . That 's as far as he ever went in complaining . In this same letter , he wrote , You ask if our hands were tied . They have been at different times but are not anymore . Anyway , as St. Paul reminds us , God 's word is not bound . ' " Mrs. Kennedy pulled another letter out of the stack . " This one was written by Mike last November 18th , from Komiteh Prison , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to terms with his situation , and he realized that this terrible situation had its benefits  --  that it had given him an opportunity to develop , once his protected , structured , little diplomatic world was pulled from under him . And so he wrote , ' This year , for me , has been one of extraordinary growth . I see things with a clarity that never otherwise would have been vouchsafed to me. ' "
