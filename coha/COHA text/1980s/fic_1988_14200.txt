The set : a marble bench , a college dormitory-style desk and bed , a telephone booth  --  all located haphazardly about stage , looking pale and designed for the forties . An October night in 1946 . JONATHAN and SANDY , two college boys at a dance . JONATHAN sits on bench bent over . A medley of tunes from the forties plays low in the background : " Night and Day , " " The Dreamer , " " Frenesie , " " Chattanooga Choo-Choo , " etcetera . Note : The frequent scene changes should be visible to the audience and not occur during blackouts , which tend to have a stop/start effect on the flow of the play . Blackouts occur only where indicated . SANDY Are you gon na let your wife work ? JONATHAN She wo n't have to , with all her father 's money . SANDY You want to marry only a rich girl ? JONATHAN It 's as easy to fall in love with a rich girl  --  SANDY As a poor one . I do n't care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on my own . It 's a matter of faith in yourself . JONATHAN You also have to be realistic . SANDY When I 'm realistic I feel crappy . I 'd rather have faith . p. 3 JONATHAN If you had the choice  --  SANDY Yeah ? JONATHAN Would you rather love a girl or have her love you ? SANDY I 'd want it mutual  --  JONATHAN I mean if you could n't have it mutual . SANDY You mean would I rather be the one who loves or is loved ? JONATHAN Yeah . SANDY It 's not that easy a question . I think I 'd rather be in love . JONATHAN Me too . I would n't want to get hurt , though . SANDY No . But I would n't want to hurt anybody else , either . JONATHAN Every time I start being in love , the girl does something that turns me cold . SANDY You were in love with Gloria . JONATHAN I started to be in love . And then she let me feel her up on the first date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with her . JONATHAN Well , she let me feel her up . SANDY Yeah . What about Gwen ? p. 4 JONATHAN Her I could talk to . SANDY I 've never been able to talk to any girl . JONATHAN I was really getting crazy about her . But she was stuck-up . She would n't let me lay a hand on her . So I went back to Gloria . SANDY You want perfection . JONATHAN What do you want , wise guy ? SANDY She just has to be nice , that 's all . JONATHAN You do n't want her beautiful ? SANDY She does n't have to be beautiful . I 'd like her built , though . JONATHAN I 'd want mine sexy looking . SANDY I would n't want her to look like a tramp . JONATHAN Sexy does n't mean she has to look like a tramp . There 's a middle ground . SANDY I 'd want that , yeah . JONATHAN Tall , very tall . SANDY ( A nervous laugh ) That would scare me . JONATHAN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd wan na be boss . p. 5 JONATHAN With mine , we 'd start the same sentences together . SANDY I 'd like to do that . JONATHAN Like she knows what I 'm thinking . We mesh . We do n't know how . It 's fate . SANDY I do n't want a girl who knows everything I 'm thinking . That 's a little spooky . JONATHAN I mean the clean stuff . I do n't want her to know the secret stuff  --  that you save for your friends  --  but just the stuff that makes you feel better . Do n't you want her to know that ? SANDY Yeah . Sure . I 'd want that . Sure . ( Pause ) A virgin . JONATHAN Big tits . SANDY Yeah . But still a virgin . JONATHAN I would n't mind if she was just a little ahead of me  --  SANDY You want a whore ? JONATHAN I 'd want it mutual . But where I 'm not so much in charge and she knows the different ways SANDY That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That other stuff I can get on the outside . JONATHAN The first time I do it I do n't want to just do it . I want it to be the best thing that ever happened to me. p. 6 SANDY I feel the same way about getting laid as I feel about going to college . I 'm being pressured into it . ( SUSAN enters . JONATHAN and SANDY stare as she passes by . ) JONATHAN You like that ? SANDY Yeah ! JONATHAN I give her to you . SANDY What 's wrong with her ? JONATHAN I 'm a generous guy . SANDY I 'm grateful . How do I break the news to her ? JONATHAN You go over there  --  SANDY Yeah  --  JONATHAN There is a way to talk to girls . Tell her a joke . SANDY O.K. What joke ? JONATHAN Tell her about your unhappy childhood . SANDY Hey , that 's not bad . JONATHAN But do n't make it like an act . SANDY No  --  JONATHAN Go ahead ! Go ahead , schmuck ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SANDY You ? You ca n't even stand up . ( HE crosses to SUSAN and stares at her back until SHE senses his presence . SHE turns around and stares back at him inquiringly . A long exchange of stares . HE turns and goes back to JONATHAN . ) I fucked up . p. 7 JONATHAN It 's my turn . SANDY Whadayamean it 's your turn ? She 's mine ! You gave her to me ! JONATHAN You struck out . SANDY I get two more times at bat . ( HE crosses to SUSAN , stares at her back until SHE senses his presence . SHE turns around and returns the stare . A long exchange of stares . ) What do you care about my problems , right ? ( HE turns and starts away ) SUSAN This is the first time I 've ever been to a college mixer . SANDY ( Stops and slowly turns ) Me too . I hate them . SUSAN I hate them , too . SANDY ( Advances on her ) It 's such a phony way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SANDY So even if you meet somebody you do n't know who you 're meeting . SUSAN Because you 're meeting the act . SANDY That 's right . Not the person . SUSAN I 'm not sure I agree . SANDY With what ? p. 8 SUSAN With what you said . SANDY No , I do n't either . SUSAN You do n't agree you do n't know who you 're meeting because they 're putting on an act ? SANDY ( Cautious ) How do you feel about it ? SUSAN I think people only like to think they 're putting on an act because it 's really not an act , but them ; but if they think it 's an act they feel better because they think they can always change it ; but if it 's really them , they ca n't . SANDY You mean they 're kidding themselves when they think they 're putting on an act because it 's not an act . SUSAN Yes , it is an act . But they 're the act . The act is them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be an act ? SUSAN Because they 're an act . SANDY But they 're also real . SUSAN No . SANDY You mean I 'm not real . SUSAN No . SANDY ( Hurt ) I 'm an act . SUSAN It 's all right . I 'm an act , too . Do n't you behave differently with different people ? p. 9 SANDY No . SUSAN With your family ? SANDY Oh , I thought you meant different people . Well , sure , my family  --  SUSAN And with your friends you 're another way . SANDY Well , sure , my friends  --  SUSAN And with your teachers you 're still another way . So which one is you ? SANDY They 're all me . SUSAN There are three yous ? That does n't make sense . SANDY I mean it 's still me that 's doing all these things . SUSAN You mean no matter how different you 're behaving inside , you still know it 's you ? SANDY All the time . SUSAN So is n't that an act ? SANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . ( Laughs ) You ought to be a lawyer . SUSAN I 'm going to be a lawyer . SANDY A lady lawyer . Um  --  you 're from Smith , right ? ( SHE nods ) Do you like it ? p. 10 SUSAN I like it all right . Do you like Amherst ? SANDY Sure , why should n't I ? My parents worked very hard to send me . ( Laughs ) I better like it . ( Pause ) Do you have a name or something ? SUSAN Susan . SANDY I 'm Sandy . SUSAN ( Begins to sway in rhythm to the music ) The music is nice , is n't it ? ( SANDY crosses to JONATHAN . The music stops , but SUSAN continues to sway rhythmically . ) SANDY She 's too much for me to handle . JONATHAN I think you can make out with her . SANDY You think so ? JONATHAN She 's stuff . SANDY You think so ? JONATHAN I would n't kick her out of bed . SANDY I should n't try somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's the best-looking girl at the whole mixer , I 'll say that for her . ( To JONATHAN ) Is n't she ? p. 11 JONATHAN Her tits are too small . SANDY I was thinking that . The hell with her . JONATHAN But her legs are great . SANDY You think so ? Standing so close , I could n't really tell about her legs . ( Stares at her ) JONATHAN I would n't kick her out of bed . SANDY She 's got some funny ideas . JONATHAN I would n't kick her out of bed . ( SANDY nods grimly , then crosses back to SUSAN . Lights alter to simulate moonlight . SANDY kisses her . HE tries to kiss her again . SHE avoids it . ) SUSAN Do n't rush me . SANDY I like you very much , Susan . ( HE tries unsuccessfully to kiss her ) It 's our third date . SUSAN ( Takes his hand ) I like you , too . SANDY You let me kiss you last week . SUSAN And this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to kiss you at least twice tonight . SUSAN ( Smiles ) You 're the only boy I know who I can open up with . p. 12 SANDY I ca n't see you being quiet for any guy . SUSAN Not quiet , exactly . But if you know somebody 's not going to approve of what you are  --  SANDY Whatever that is . SUSAN Whatever that is . If you know that , well , you just do n't tell him . If I like a boy , if I want him to keep liking me and I 'm brighter than he is , I have to not show it or I 'll lose him . So it 's hard . SANDY Well , I would n't want anyone overly bright . SUSAN But you would n't feel threatened  --  SANDY I think I 'd feel bothered . SUSAN I do n't think you would nearly as much as some people . You would n't mind your wife  --  after you got married  --  your wife working ? SANDY I do n't necessarily see anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share responsibilities in the home . SANDY I do n't mind dish-washing . No , I  --  SUSAN Or making beds . Or house-cleaning . SANDY Well , Susan , when is he supposed to do this ? The poor guy comes home from work and  --  p. 13 SUSAN He makes the bed while she makes dinner . Or vice-versa . And cleaning house together is only another way of making love together . Or bringing two people closer . That does n't threaten you , does it ? SANDY No . ( Pause ) Although a little . ( SHE kisses him ) SUSAN Do n't press so hard . ( THEY kiss ) See , it 's better when it 's gentle . ( THEY kiss ) See ? What are you grinning at ? ( SHE steps back into shadows . SANDY turns front and counts silently up to four on his fingers , rubs his hands in delight as lights come up Stage Right on JONATHAN , seated at a desk with an Amherst pennant pinned to it . SANDY leaves SUSAN and crosses to JONATHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , I like this girl . I do n't want to ruin things . JONATHAN Was I right about kissing her ? SANDY Listen , we had a big fight over it . JONATHAN And you won . SANDY Well , I do n't know if I won or not  --  JONATHAN Why do you let yourself be pushed around ? p. 14 SANDY You 're the one who 's pushing me around ! Well , I guess I won . Sure , I won . She kissed me three extra times , did n't she ? JONATHAN That 's when you should 've put your hand on her tit . SANDY Come on  --  When this girl 's nice enough to kiss me , I should do that to her ? JONATHAN You act as if she 's doing you a favor . SANDY Well , it is sort of a favor . Is n't it ? I mean when a girl lets you kiss her and , you know , go on from there  --  feel her up and , you know , the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I mean is n't it a favor ? What 's in it for her ? I mean if she 's not getting paid or anything ? ( JONATHAN starts to laugh . SANDY is embarrassed . ) Fuck you ! ( JONATHAN roars with laughter . SANDY is increasingly furious . ) O.K. , O.K. , I 'll feel her up ! ( SANDY crosses to SUSAN , seated on ground . THEY kiss . There is a brief struggle . ) SUSAN Sandy , please take your hand off my breast . SANDY Why ? SUSAN Because I want you to . ( HE does n't move ) How can it be any fun for you when you know I do n't want it ? p. 15 SANDY I did n't say it was fun . SUSAN Then why is your hand where it is ? SANDY Because the way we 're going , by this time I should be feeling you up . SUSAN I do n't feel that way about you , Sandy . SANDY I feel that way about you . SUSAN But you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SANDY I thought you liked me . SUSAN I do like you , but I like you for other reasons . SANDY So ? SUSAN If we went any further , there would n't be those reasons anymore . SANDY Well , we might have something else , though . SUSAN What ? SANDY ( Shrugs ) Something else . You 're the first girl I 've ever done that to , Susan . SUSAN I did n't know that . SANDY It does n't show ? ( SUSAN smiles . SHE puts his hand on her breast . HE takes it away . ) Susan , are you a virgin ? ( SHE nods . HE puts his hand back on her breast . ) What do I do with my other hand ? ( SHE puts it on her other breast ) What are you gon na do with your hands ? ( A pause . The lights lower . In the shadows a sudden move by SUSAN , and SANDY lets out a surprised yell and then a loud , nervous but pleasurable , laugh . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated as before , with SANDY on his feet , zipping his fly , a broad smile on his face . HE crosses to JONATHAN. ) p. 16 JONATHAN And then what ? SANDY She told me to take my hand off her breast . JONATHAN And then what ? SANDY I said I do n't want to . JONATHAN And then what ? SANDY She said how could it be fun for me when she did n't like it . JONATHAN ( Disgusted ) Jesus ! SANDY So I said , I thought you liked me . JONATHAN Yeah ? SANDY And she said , I like you for other reasons . JONATHAN Other reasons ? ! SANDY So I told her how I really needed this . JONATHAN What did you tell her ? SANDY You know  --  that it was my first time . JONATHAN Your first time what ? What did you say exactly ? SANDY I do n't remember exactly  --  that she 's the first girl I ever tried to feel up . JONATHAN You told her that ? SANDY Was it a mistake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SANDY Then she got nicer to me . JONATHAN What do you mean , nicer ? SANDY She put my hand on her breast . JONATHAN You mean you put it on and she left it . SANDY No , she picked it up and put it on . JONATHAN She picked up your hand like this  --  ( Mimes motion with his own hand )  --  and put it on like this ? ( Puts hand on his own breast ) SANDY That 's right . JONATHAN She did n't take your hand when it was halfway and just sort of guide it in ? SANDY ( Shakes his head ) So I did n't know what to think . JONATHAN ( Leers ) You did n't , huh ? SANDY I mean from just wanting to be friends , she 's suddenly getting pretty aggressive . JONATHAN And then what ? SANDY I asked her if she was a virgin . JONATHAN ( Laughs ) You 're kidding ! p. 18 SANDY Was that a mistake ? ( JONATHAN shrugs ) Anyhow , she is . JONATHAN She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two hands on her tits ? SANDY By this time she 's put the other hand on her other one . JONATHAN She put both hands on ? ( SANDY nods ) Two hands ? ( SANDY nods ) SANDY So I said , what are you gon na do with your hands ? JONATHAN ( Laughs ) You did n't say that . SANDY ( Pleased ) It just came out ! JONATHAN Then what ? SANDY She  --  let me see if I got this right  --  yeah  --  she unzipped my fly . JONATHAN Bullshit artist ! ( HE slaps his hands together ) And then what ? ( A spreading grin from SANDY ) Then what ? ! SANDY She did it . JONATHAN Did what ? ( SANDY makes hand motion indicating masturbation ) Bullshit artist ! ( SANDY shakes his head , grinning . Indicates masturbation . ) She really did that ? ( SANDY is virtually jumping up and down in excitement . HE and JONATHAN begin to giggle . The giggle explodes into a roar . ) She did that ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up phone , and dials ) Is this Susan ? Well , you do n't know me , I 'm a friend of Sandy 's , his roommate . Yeah , Jonathan . He told you about me ? Yeah  --  so I 'm just here at Smith for tonight  --  practically on campus . I was taking a drive to work out some personal problems , you know  --  and I found myself practically on campus . And I got some time to kill . So I was wondering , Susan  --  ( BLACKOUT . Lights up . JONATHAN and SUSAN sitting at coffee-house table. ) p. 19 JONATHAN Do you like Smith ? SUSAN What 's your major ? JONATHAN Where 'd you go to high school ? SUSAN Where do you go in the summer ? JONATHAN Do you always answer a question with a question ? SUSAN Do you always date your best friend 's girlfriends ? JONATHAN Sandy told me you were beautiful . SUSAN He told me you were sexy . I guess he 's just a poor judge . JONATHAN I guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , am I that homely ? JONATHAN You have a special quality . I like girls who are special . SUSAN I 'm hardly that special . JONATHAN You ca n't tell . That 's another thing , you 're not stuck-up . SUSAN How do you know so much about me ? JONATHAN Some people you can tell about right away . Most girls I talk to , it 's like we 're both spies from foreign countries and we 're speaking in code . Everything means something else . Like I say , " Would you like to take a walk ? " And it means something else . And she says , " I ca n't , I 've got a French test tomorrow . " And it means something else . p. 20 SUSAN And you say , " I 'll come over and help you study . " And it means something else . JONATHAN You 've very sharp . I like that . SUSAN And that means something else . JONATHAN You 're too sharp . SUSAN Does that bother you ? JONATHAN It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd be good together . SUSAN I 'm dating your best friend . JONATHAN He wo n't mind . SUSAN How do you know ? JONATHAN I wo n't tell him . SUSAN What if I mind ? JONATHAN Do you wan na go out Friday ? SUSAN I 'm seeing Sandy . JONATHAN Saturday ? SUSAN I have a date . JONATHAN Sunday ? SUSAN I 'm seeing my folks . JONATHAN Where do they live ? p. 21 SUSAN Newton . JONATHAN Sunday night . SUSAN I 'll be too tired . JONATHAN I 'll help you get over your folks . ( SHE smiles ) How about it , Susan ? What are you so afraid of ? SUSAN ( Laughs ) Not you . ( SHE rises from table and crosses to SANDY ) SANDY You 're beautiful . SUSAN I 'm not beautiful . SANDY I think you are . SUSAN My nose is too small and my teeth are n't straight and my neck is too long and I walk funny unless I watch myself , then I can make it look sexy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ; it 's like combing bread sticks . SANDY It looks great . SUSAN I have a weight problem . When I 'm nervous I empty the refrigerator , and I 'm always nervous . SANDY You should weigh two hundred pounds the way you talk . SUSAN I feel like it sometimes . p. 22 SANDY Here I thought you were beautiful  --  SUSAN Well , I 'm not . SANDY And you turn out to be a dog . SUSAN Do n't call me that . SANDY I was kidding . SUSAN I know , but I hate it when boys use words like " dog . " SANDY I wo n't use it if you do n't want me to  --  what 's wrong with calling a dog a " dog " ? SUSAN It 's not right to judge a person 's whole life by whether she 's attractive in one way . There are other ways of being attractive , but if you judge too quickly , then people go through life being called dogs when they 're really very wonderful people . Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me at a dance on Mars and say : Some dog ! You 're too sensitive to think in terms like that , Sandy . SANDY I 'm not that sensitive . SUSAN But you are . SANDY Do n't call me sensitive . SUSAN Why not ? SANDY You do n't like " dog , " I do n't like " sensitive . " SUSAN But there 's nothing wrong with being sensitive . p. 23 SANDY I do n't see anything worng with saying " dog . " But I 'm giving it up . SUSAN Well then , I wo n't say it anymore . SANDY O.K. SUSAN But I 'll think it . SANDY I do n't care what you think . SUSAN We ca n't do that , Sandy . If we start thinking things about each other that we 're afraid to say  --  well , if it 's " dog " and " sensitive " today , it 'll be other things tomorrow and more things the next day , and soon we wo n't dare talk to each other because something might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SANDY Then I say exactly what I feel . O.K. ? SUSAN And I say what I feel . ( THEY kiss ) SANDY Dog . SUSAN Sensitive . ( HE puts his hand around her throat . SHE laughs . SANDY rises and crosses to JONATHAN . ) SANDY I think I 'm in love . JONATHAN Bullshit artist . SANDY I really think so . JONATHAN You get in yet ? p. 24 SANDY What 's that got to do with it ? JONATHAN How do you know if you do n't know how you are in bed together ? SANDY That 's not everything . JONATHAN It 's a lot . SANDY But I can talk to her ! JONATHAN You can talk to me , too . Are you in love with me ? SANDY I can say things to her I would n't dare say to you . JONATHAN What , for instance ? SANDY Things you 'd laugh at . JONATHAN Listen , I 'm laughing now . SANDY She thinks I 'm sensitive . JONATHAN Sensitive . ( Laughs ) Oh boy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about ? Flowers ? SANDY Books . JONATHAN Books ? You phony , I read more books than you do . SANDY I 'm going to start . I 'm reading The Fountainhead . JONATHAN The Fountainhead ? What 's that ? p. 25 SANDY It 's her favorite book . You ever hear of Jean Christophe ? JONATHAN What 's that ? SANDY It 's a classic , you moron . I 'm going to read it right after The Fountainhead . JONATHAN Yeah  --  you ever read Guadalcanal Diary by Richard Tregaskis ? SANDY No . JONATHAN That was a best seller and I read it . You ever read A Bell for Adano ? By John Hersey ? SANDY No . JONATHAN Another best seller , and I read that ! You ever read Gentlemen 's Agreement by Laura Z. Hobson ? SANDY I 'm going to read everything from now on . JONATHAN I read a lot more than you . So who 's the one who 's sensitive ? You or me ? Come on ! Who 's sensitive ? ! ( JONATHAN crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSAN What does your father do ? JONATHAN He fails . ( SHE laughs ) It 's not funny . SUSAN ( Sobers immediately ) Were you very poor ? p. 26 JONATHAN My father could n't hold onto a job . He kept giving me advice . The more he failed , the more advice I got . My mother always says , " Listen to your father , he knows what he 's talking about , " but she never listens . He 's a communist , my father . SUSAN We 're Republicans . JONATHAN You 're not isolationists , though ? SUSAN Oh , no . Sometimes I think I 'm a communist . JONATHAN Me too . We have so much and other people have , you know , so little . After I get set up as a lawyer what I 'd really like to do is get into politics . Help the poor . Public service . What really gets me is I was too young to fight in the war , because what was that all about except to show that only if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though I 'm the first in my family to get a college education , I do n't ever want to forget where I came from . SUSAN You 're a lot more serious than I thought . JONATHAN I know . ( HE kisses her , then leaves her and crosses over to SANDY ) SANDY Where 'd you meet her ? JONATHAN I 'm another person with her . You would n't recognize me . The things that come out of my mouth  --  p. 27 SANDY Hey , she really sounds like something . Is she built ? JONATHAN She  --  she 's got a quality  --  she does n't talk much , but the things she has to say are so sharp . SANDY We should double-date sometime . JONATHAN Well , I want to know her a little better , y'know , before we double-date . SANDY Gee , is n't it great ? A month ago neither of us even knew a girl . JONATHAN And now we know one . SANDY What 's her name ? JONATHAN Myrtle . ( JONATHAN leaves SANDY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( THEY kiss ) What are you thinking ? JONATHAN That I want to be terribly successful . SUSAN You were thinking that now ? JONATHAN You do it to me . I wan na rule the world ! SUSAN Master ! JONATHAN You do n't care because you 're a woman . But you need power if you wan na do any good in the world . And money , too ! ( HE kisses her ) p. 28 SUSAN I do n't think money 's really that important , do you ? JONATHAN You come from a rich home , that 's why you think that . SUSAN We 're not rich . JONATHAN By my standards , you 're rich . You 've been protected from the world . Nobody gave me anything . SUSAN You 're not being fair . JONATHAN Why ? SUSAN The way you talk about my background . JONATHAN I 'm not right ? SUSAN I never saw myself as a spoiled rich girl . JONATHAN The truth hurts . SUSAN Well , if it 's the truth , why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're special . SUSAN I do n't feel so special . JONATHAN You are special . SUSAN I feel inadequate and foolish . JONATHAN Hey , do n't talk about my girl that way . SUSAN I do n't feel like your girl . JONATHAN Whose girl are you ? p. 29 SUSAN ( Desolate ) Nobody 's girl . ( HE kisses her . SHE returns it passionately . Lights come up on SANDY . ) SANDY She 's too much for me . ( JONATHAN leaves SUSAN and crosses to SANDY ) JONATHAN You must be kidding . SANDY She can do so many things . She wants to be a lawyer . JONATHAN A lawyer ? ! Who said so ? SANDY She did ! And she wants to write novels ! JONATHAN You 're full of it . SANDY What should I do ? JONATHAN She wants to write books ? SANDY She 'll find out how much of a schmuck I am , that 'll be the end ! JONATHAN She sounds like a real phony to me . SANDY If anything , she 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her anymore . JONATHAN I 'm still seeing her . SANDY It 's not working out ? JONATHAN It 's working out O.K. p. 30 SANDY Tell me about her . JONATHAN ( Thinks ) She 's quiet . she listens to me . ( A pause ) There 's not all that much to tell . ( JONATHAN turns away from SANDY ) Susan  --  ( Lights come up on SUSAN next to bed . JONATHAN crosses to her , takes her in his arms . ) SUSAN I love how much stronger you are than me . JONATHAN Let 's do it . SUSAN I ca n't . ( HE pulls her down on bed ) JONATHAN Let 's do it , Susan . SUSAN Part of me wants to . Do n't you know that ? JONATHAN You can if you want to . SUSAN I do n't think I should . Let me relieve you . JONATHAN No . No . I need you , Susan . SUSAN I 'm afraid . JONATHAN There 's nothing to be afraid of . SUSAN I 'm too scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust me . SUSAN I do trust you . p. 31 JONATHAN No , you do n't . That 's what it 's really about , is n't it ? SUSAN ( Weakening ) I want to . JONATHAN ( Urgently ) Trust me , trust me , Susan . ( HE bends toward he . THEY embrace passionately . Lights up on SANDY . ) SANDY I 'm in love ! ( JONATHAN rises from the embrace and crosses to SANDY ) JONATHAN No , you 're not . You do n't know the first thing about the girl . SANDY She tells me everything . Are you kidding ? JONATHAN I just do n't think she 's your type , Sandy . SANDY What do you know ? JONATHAN Take my word for it , she does n't tell you everything . SANDY Anyhow , she 's a person , not a type . What 's a type ? How would you like it if I called Myrtle a " type " ? JONATHAN ( Smiles ) I was n't going to tell you this . ( Grins ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grins ) You 're kidding me  --  you 're not kidding me  --  you really did it ? ( HE lets out a cowboy yell , hugs JONATHAN , slaps him on the back ) You beat me to it , you bastard , you lucky bastard ! Finding a girl who puts out ! Next , it 's my turn ! p. 32 JONATHAN Forget her , Sandy . That 's my advice . SANDY I 've just been taking it easy on her . JONATHAN Sandy , believe me , find somebody else . SANDY Are you crazy ? When I 'm right on the verge ? I see her tomorrow night ! ( Starts off ) JONATHAN Uh  --  Sandy , do you ever talk to her about me ? SANDY ( Turns to JONATHAN ) Sometimes . JONATHAN Uh  --  Sandy , will you do me a favor ? Do n't tell her I got laid . ( SANDY turns and briskly crosses to SUSAN . HE throws himself on her and they fall onto bed . ) SANDY Let 's do it . SUSAN I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . SUSAN ( Smiles ) You 're ready . ( SHE squeezes his hand ) I 'm not good enough for you , Sandy . SANDY That 's not true , Susan . Do n't ever say that ! I 'm the one who 's not good enough ! SUSAN No . If anything , you 're too good . p. 33 SANDY I 'm not good . SUSAN ( Playful ) Sensitive . SANDY Argh . SUSAN ( Smiles , then very seriously ) If you really want to know  --  SANDY What 's the matter , Susan ? SUSAN This will offend you . SANDY Nothing you can say will offend me . SUSAN It 's your hard-on . SANDY What 's the matter with it ? SUSAN It 's not you  --  it 's me . SANDY Susan , what 's the matter with me ? SUSAN I feel more alive , more like myself with you than any boy I know  --  SANDY You 've got to tell me  --  SUSAN And then we start to neck and you get a hard-on . And I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with another anonymous boy saying all those anonymous things . " Let 's do it . " " No . " " Why not ? " " You 're hurting me . " All those stupid , anonymous words . We could be anybody ! SANDY I could n't feel this way with anybody , Susan . p. 34 SUSAN You could n't , but your hard-on could . That 's why I wo n't do it . We 're too personal with each other  --  do n't you see what I mean ? No ? Oh , Sandy , there 's something so special about you  --  do n't turn away  --  there is ; but then you get hard and you could be anybody . They 're so depersonalizing , Sandy . They 're like Martians ! Imagine yourself in a roomful of hard-ons . It 's fascism ! SANDY Susan , I love you ! SUSAN I love you for saying that , Sandy . SANDY Do you love me ? SUSAN In a way . SANDY Then let 's do it . SUSAN That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Oohhhhhhh  --  Oohhhhhhhhhh ! ( Lights come up low . JONATHAN and SUSAN in bed . ) JONATHAN I used to wake up in the morning and all I could think of was girls . Not even getting laid  --  it was purer than that . I 'd follow them down the street wondering how they got their arms to swing from their elbows that way  --  backwards that way  --  and why they liked to walk barefoot . Girls walking barefoot ! And girls who rub their noses . What is that ? Always with their index fingers . Girls wrinkling their brows , rubbing their noses , touching you . Right here on the arm ! Jesus , girls have great hands . And girl skin . Nothing that ever lived feels as good to touch as girl skin . To be with a girl with great girl skin and girl hands , wrinkling her brow , rubbing her nose , touching my arm , barefoot , and me with shoes on ! Oh , Susan  --  girls were killing my life ! You 've saved me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANDY ) p. 35 SANDY Please , Susan . SUSAN Sometimes I want to do it , and a second later I do n't want to do it . SANDY Let 's do it . SUSAN I do n't know why you put up with me . SANDY I 'm in such pain . ( THEY cross to bed , sit ) SUSAN Let me  --  ( Puts hand on his thigh . SANDY pushes it aside . ) SANDY Not anymore . SUSAN Please , Sandy . SANDY Not anymore . Oh , Susan , let 's do it . ( No response ) I love you ! ( A pause ) SUSAN Do you have anything ? ( SANDY pulls out a condom ) How long have you had that ? SANDY Not too long . SUSAN Not a year or anything like that ? SANDY I 'm sure it 's O.K. SUSAN I do n't want to take any chances . SANDY These things have to be O.K. ( No answer ) It 's O.K. ( No answer ) I 'm positive it 's O.K. ( BLACKOUT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 JONATHAN I want to go into homes and shake people ! Look who you 're with ! You know who that is ? That 's another human being ! The way they use each other for doormats ! SUSAN My parents  --  a perfect example . JONATHAN No , really ? SUSAN My father , really . My mother does everything my father says . JONATHAN My father , who 's got no balls left , thinks every woman is a whore except my mother . And she wo n't let him lay a hand on her . And he taught me about sex so I would n't learn about it in the streets . Thank God for the streets ! After my father , I had to go out in the streets just to get straightened out . ( SUSAN leaves JONATHAN and crosses over to SANDY , who is reading from a pile of manuscript pages ) SANDY ( Looks up ) How long did it take you to write all this ? SUSAN ( Shrugs ) Over the last year . SANDY I 'm no critic  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at page ) I 'm a slow reader . SUSAN That 's all right . I like to sit and watch you . SANDY ( Continues to read ) This girl , Susannah . Is she supposed to be you ? p. 37 SUSAN Heavens , no ! Does she sound like me ? SANDY No , that 's what I was thinking  --  but the name ? SUSAN I just wanted a good Southern belle type name . SANDY She really has a rough time of it . SUSAN What part are you up to ? SANDY She 's horse-whipping this Negro slave . SUSAN Abraham . SANDY Yeah . And he takes the whip away from her . This is hot stuff , what he does to her . SUSAN Well , she deserves it , does n't she ? SANDY How do you know this is true ? SUSAN Reading history . SANDY These slaves , they actually did this stuff to these white women  --  what he does to her ? I do n't see how they got away with it . ( Reads on ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . SANDY One question : Whose side am I supposed to be on ? SUSAN Well , he 's a victim because he 's a slave , of course . But she 's a victim , too . It 's the system . p. 38 SANDY ( Reading ) Wow ! ( HE puts down the page , crosses to her and kisses her passionately ) SUSAN Finish the story . ( SANDY continues his embrace ) Finish the story . ( Lights come up on JONATHAN ) JONATHAN I 'm tired of hearing about it , already ! It 's as if you 're the first guy in history who ever got laid . ( SANDY comes out of the embrace , crosses to JONATHAN ) SANDY I 'm the first guy in my history who ever got laid . JONATHAN I like it , too , but you do n't hear me crowing about it . There 's such a thing as good taste . SANDY What 's the matter with you ? JONATHAN Jesus ! SANDY After you started scoring , what did I get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed , under the bed  --  Myrtle , Myrtle , Myrtle  --  Maybe you forget , but I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle , and who scored first ? You ! That did n't make me feel very good , you know . In fact , it made me feel very jealous . But did I try to shut you up ? Did I say , " I 'm tired of hearing about it , already " ? I did n't say it . Because I 'm your friend . So I sat through it . p. 39 JONATHAN O.K. O.K. SANDY Jesus ! JONATHAN You made your point . SANDY Sometimes I think I think I 'm a better friend to you than you are to me . JONATHAN So it 's going O.K. , huh ? SANDY O.K. ? ( Grins ) You do n't know the half of it ! We look in each other 's eyes and we do n't have to talk . We just start undressing . " Gentle " is the only word to describe it . Like I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deep as I like , but I know she 's there to hold onto . And , afterwards , we lie in bed just holding each other  --  In a way , it 's the best part , the way we 're all wrapped up  --  it 's like we 're one body  --  ( JONATHAN clamps both hands over his ears and stalks away . SANDY does not notice . JONATHAN stalks over to SUSAN . ) JONATHAN This has to stop . SUSAN I do n't know how to tell him . JONATHAN You do n't have any trouble telling him lots of other things . SUSAN What does that mean ? JONATHAN The way you talk to him . I do n't hear you ever talking to me that way . p. 40 SUSAN What way ? JONATHAN I do n't know . All I know is it could be another girl , the way he talks about you . SUSAN He 's very vulnerable . I do n't want to hurt him . JONATHAN You 're hurting me . SUSAN He loves me . JONATHAN That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SHE turns away ) And you woulda just gone on , would n't you ? If he hadn't 've told me ? SUSAN I do n't know . JONATHAN I wouldn't 've known a thing about it . SUSAN I do n't know . Maybe . JONATHAN Boy , you 're really something . SUSAN I do n't feel like something . I feel like nothing . JONATHAN How much longer do you expect me to take this ? SUSAN I 'm trying to tell him . JONATHAN I see how you 're trying ! We have n't been to bed in two weeks ! SUSAN It 's not my fault . I do n't enjoy these fights . JONATHAN Listen , it 's me you 're supposed to be in love with . p. 41 SUSAN You 're stronger . JONATHAN Why do n't you give me some of the understanding you give him ? SUSAN He 's more helpless . JONATHAN Well , you 're not gon na turn me helpless . SUSAN I 'm the one who 's helpless here . JONATHAN You 're not helpless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free with Sandy . ( SHE shrugs ) Why ca n't you feel free with me ? ( SHE turns away . JONATHAN crosses to SANDY . ) SANDY She understands me so completely , Jonathan , it 's unbelievable . Every mood of mine she knows almost before I know it myself . She tells me thoughts I have that I did n't even know I had until she tells them to me , and then I know she 's right . It 's fantastic ! And she says she 's no good for me . JONATHAN She said that , huh ? SANDY After we did it on the grass she said that . JONATHAN She laid you first . SANDY She 's crazy ! Every time we do it she has to say she 's no good for me ! p. 42 JONATHAN Sandy , I think she 's trying to tell you something . SANDY I know she is , but I ca n't figure out what . JONATHAN That she wants out ! SANDY ( Laughs ) You must be out of your mind . JONATHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you down easy . ( SANDY laughs , unbelieving ) Go on and laugh . You 'll find out ! ( SANDY laughs ) Go and and laugh ! SANDY ( Shows him a long rip in his shirt ) Look at this . ( Opens his shirt and displays rip in his undershirt ) Look at this . ( Starts to undo trousers ) Hey , wait ! Look at this ! ( JONATHAN turns away and crosses to SUSAN ) SUSAN He showed you ! JONATHAN Of course , he showed me ! He shows me everything ! He 's my best friend ! SUSAN I ca n't take much more of this , Jonathan . I do n't know how to tell him . JONATHAN Then I 'll tell him . SUSAN No , Jonathan ! p. 43 JONATHAN I was wrong about you . SUSAN How were you wrong ? JONATHAN I do n't know . I just think I was wrong . SUSAN Jonathan , waht do you mean you were wrong ? JONATHAN Susan , I do n't know what 's going on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so important now . SUSAN How were you wrong about me ? JONATHAN You make me  --  sometimes you make me not know what I want . SUSAN What do you want , Jonathan ? JONATHAN I want you and me . Ten years from now , I want you and me . Thirty years from now , I want you and me . What do you want ? SUSAN I want to believe you . JONATHAN Yeah , but ten years from now . What do you want ten years from now ? SUSAN I do n't know . JONATHAN You do n't know every mood of mine like you know every mood of his . SUSAN No . JONATHAN How come ? SUSAN I do n't know . p. 44 JONATHAN You do n't tell me thoughts I never knew I had . SUSAN Does he say I do that ? ( HE nods ) Then I guess I must . JONATHAN You do it , all right . So do it with me . SUSAN I ca n't . JONATHAN You can do it with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts ! ( Stares at him ) I ca n't . JONATHAN Why ca n't you ? SUSAN I ca n't with you . JONATHAN This has gone far enough . SUSAN I ca n't stand any more ultimatums , Jonathan . JONATHAN Tonight you tell him , or tomorrow I tell him ! Look at me , Susan . ( SHE looks at him ) Now , tell me my goddamned thoughts ! ( Lights up on SANDY . He is taking his shirt off . ) SANDY ( Sings ) " Oh , the weather outside is frightful , But the fire is so delightful.And as long as you love me so , Let it snow , let it snow , let it snow . " ( JONATHAN bolts away from SUSAN toward SANDY , who blacks out . JONATHAN pivots about and walks slowly back to her , his head bowed. ) p. 45 JONATHAN You did n't do it , did you ? SUSAN No . JONATHAN Why not ? SUSAN He looks at me with such trust . JONATHAN How am I looking at you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , you know my thoughts . SUSAN Did you tell him ? JONATHAN What do you think ? SUSAN No . JONATHAN So what do we do now ? SUSAN I do n't know . I guess I get an ultimatum . JONATHAN Do you think there 's any sense in this ? SUSAN In what ? JONATHAN In you and me ? SUSAN That 's up to you . JONATHAN I do n't think there 's any point . I wish I were wrong . ( SHE shrugs ) The reason I did n't say anything to Sandy  --  SUSAN Yes ? JONATHAN I knew he would n't believe me . And I 'd go into details so he 'd have to believe me . And I knew he 'd come running to you . And I knew you 'd tell him everything I said was true . And I knew then you 'd go to bed with him . p. 46 SUSAN Yes . That sounds like what would happen . JONATHAN So , anyhow  --  I never knew I could feel  --  ( A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUSAN Neither do I. JONATHAN I do n't feel any love , I know that . SUSAN Neither do I. JONATHAN I feel more tired than anything , if you want to know the truth . SUSAN You 're very different from when we met . ( JONATHAN shrugs ) You are . JONATHAN And what did it get me ? SUSAN You can be very intimidating . JONATHAN And what did it get me , being different ? SUSAN You used to terrify me . JONATHAN ( Bitter ) You 're not scared of me anymore ? SUSAN So . JONATHAN ( Starts away ) So . SUSAN Jonathan . ( He turns ) I 'll always be your friend . p. 47 JONATHAN ( A long , thoughtful stare ) Jesus , Susan  --  I hope not . ( Lights lower slowly on SUSAN as JONATHAN crosses to SANDY ) SANDY And then she grabs the book out of my hand  --  JONATHAN ( Grinning ) Yeah ? yeah ? SANDY And she practically screamed , she 's so mad at me ! JONATHAN No kidding ? SANDY And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got one-half of the book and I got the other half and we 're both pulling , and I yell , " Watch it ! It 's Moby Dick ! " So she lets go so quickly I fall back on the bed , and I start laughing . And she starts laughing . And the two of us are laughing so hard we ca n't even see straight , and we start undressing each other  --  JONATHAN No kidding ! SANDY But we ca n't keep a straight face , so it 's almost impossible for me , you know , to make it , but , anyhow , we do it , and after we do it she starts talking the way she always does , with me half-asleep  --  It 's wonderful . JONATHAN What does she say ? What does she say ? SANDY Like how she 's more of a kid now than when she was twelve because she 's more open . p. 48 JONATHAN More open . Yeah ? SANDY More open and not scared of failing , because if you do n't fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't take chances it means you 're dead . JONATHAN Dead . Yeah ? SANDY So even failure is in a way a sort of success because it proves you 're alive . JONATHAN Terrific . SANDY And what college should be is not so much to learn but to unlearn all the half-assed nonsense we get from our environment  --  JONATHAN Terrific ! Go on . SANDY And to learn not to be threatened by what 's new the way she was threatened for a long time , but she said now she was alive and was going to stay alive , and she said she loved me . She never said that before . JONATHAN She said she loved you . ( HE walks away from SANDY ) SANDY I 've been waiting six months to hear her say it . I gave her time . I knew she 'd say it . JONATHAN Go on . SANDY So we started making plans to go camping as soon as school 's over because she thinks I should get to know nature , and we 'll fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we 'll sleep out in the open under the stars  --  ( SANDY pauses , smiling , lost in thought . JONATHAN eagerly hunches forward . ) JONATHAN ( Wistful ) @x Haphazardly located about stage are a bar table which later doubles as a dining room table , motelish living room and bedroom furniture , a double bed , and an open door showing a view of a bathroom , the front door of JONATHAN 's apartment , a ping-pong table . The lights come up on the bar table . Muzak of the early ' 60s is piped in : Camelot , My Fair Lady , The Sound of Music , etc . JONATHAN and SANDY sit nursing drinks . THEY are fifteen years older , still looking young , and dressed prosperously . As THEY sip their drinks , their eyes steal stealthily across the room . JONATHAN Jesus ! You want her ? SANDY I would n't kick her out of bed . JONATHAN Will you look at the pair on her ? SANDY Look at that schmuck trying to keep up with her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack , you do your medical wack-a-doo-wack-a-doo , get her number and fuck her SANDY ( Innocent ) Who , me ? ( THEY break up ) It 's good to see you , you bastard . p. 51 JONATHAN You 're your same old ugly self . How 's Susan ? SANDY Could n't be better . We had another boy , you know . JONATHAN That makes what ? Five ? SANDY ( Laughs ) Three ! You bastard ! JONATHAN ( Laughs ) All those plans for when she got out of school . SANDY She 's a damned good mother , they 're wonderful kids . Andy 's seven , Michael 's five , and Brian is two months . JONATHAN I always said it and I say it now : You found yourself a jewel . SANDY She is a jewel . ( Pause ) She 's very active in community work . ( A pall . SANDY 's eyes move sharply across the room . ) JONATHAN Not bad that one , is she ? SANDY Listen , you must be getting more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute if I found the right girl . SANDY Bullshit artist ! You and your actress friends . JONATHAN ( Grins ) Are you kidding , doctor ? You 're the one with the deal . I mean , what can I say ? Take your clothes off , baby , I want to check out your capital gains ? p. 52 SANDY I just look . JONATHAN Bullshit artist ! SANDY Hey , Susan 's plenty enough woman for one man . Hey , will you look at that ? JONATHAN That 's Sally Joyce . SANDY Did n't I see her on Ed Sullivan ? JONATHAN I fucked her once . SANDY Bullshit artist ! JONATHAN We used to do her taxes . She 's with another firm now . SANDY Why do n't you say hello ? JONATHAN She would n't remember me . She 's a real ball-buster , that one . You think a girl really goes for you , and you find out she 's out for your money or your balls or your money and your balls . The women in this town are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your problems . JONATHAN Listen , it 's not as easy getting laid as it used to be . I do n't think I fuck more than forty new girls a year now . Out of about three hundred dates over a twelve-month period , it comes out to less than eleven percent per annum . The girls today  --  I ca n't handle them . Am I wrong or are they bigger than when we went to school ? I mean young girls , babies , nineteen , twenty  --  and they got bigger hands than me . And the size of the feet on them ! What kind of frightening business is that ? I mean , by the time I get them to bed I 'm already losing on points . And there 's no shyness anymore . You 're a doctor  --  what 's all this horseshit about orgasms ? ! Who ever talked about orgasms in our day ? I 'm supposed to worry about her coming more than I am about my coming . Fucking 's become as difficult as tax law . ( HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights up ; sits on bed and dials telephone as bar area darkens ) Miss Templeton , please . Is this Miss Templeton speaking ? The Miss Templeton who 's in the National Airlines to Miami commercial ? Running out of the Atlantic Ocean ? Miss Templeton , my name is Jonathan Fuerst . I 'm a lawyer in the firm of Dennison , Meyerson , Handlesman , Anderson &amp; Fuerst . ( Laughs ) No , I 'm not about to sue you , Miss Templeton . What I 'm calling about is we have a mutual friend , Fred Coleman at J. Walter Thompson , and when I mentioned to Fred , whom my office does the tax work for , how much I admired this particular commercial and if he knew you , well , Miss Templeton , I do n't mind telling you Fred lauded you to the heavens : " Bobbie Templeton , Bobbie Templeton , Bobbie Templeton " and so on and so forth . Your ears certainly must have been burning . And I asked him if he thought you 'd mind if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a strong respect for Fred is even if we are very good friends he has a highly developed ethical sense , and he said he could n't do that , give out your number , because he did n't think it was right for him to do things like that Yes , he is a sweet man . So on the off-chance , I called information and they had a B. Templeton on East Seventy-sixth Street listed , and I know a lot of you gals do n't like to list their first names in the Directory because you get all these creeps calling , so I thought B. Templeton might very well be you and , believe it or not , here I am and here you are . So by now , Miss Templeton , you obviously know why I 'm calling . I 'd very much like for you and I to have dinner sometime together . ( A pause ) Fred 's number ? Yeah , I have it right here . ( Looks it up ) Nine-one-four  --  **31;1370;TOOLONG . I 'll call you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pace , rubbing his hands nervously together .

HE hangs up , starts to pace , suddenly stops and yawns , then goes back to his pacing , looks at his watch , dials phone . A busy signal . HE hangs up , looks for his drink . ) Where 'd I put my drink ? ( Looks around for it ) It ca n't just disappear ! ( Continues his search , checks his watch , goes to phone , dials rapidly . A busy signal . Hangs up angrily . ) What 's she getting  --  my whole life history ? ( Waits by phone , checks watch , dials phone . It rings six times . HE hangs up , dials again . It rings and rings and rings . HE stands there listening . ) ( BLACKOUT . Bar area lights up . SANDY and JONATHAN sit on bar stools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She came this close to being what I wanted . A good pair of tits on her , but not a great pair ; almost no ass at all , and that bothered me ; sensational legs  --  I would 've settled for the legs if she had two more inches here  --  ( Indicates height ) and three more inches here . ( Indicates bust ) So anyhow that took two years out of my life . p. 53 SANDY You broke up ? JONATHAN We broke up , we came together , we broke up  --  SANDY You do n't want a family ? JONATHAN I do n't want to put it down , but who needs it ? SANDY You ca n't make fucking your life 's work . JONATHAN ( Annoyed ) Do n't tell me what I can or ca n't do . You 're so well off ? SANDY Susan 's a very good homemaker . Very efficient . I go home , everything 's in its place . Which I like . Because it 's tiring putting in a full day at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it 's nice to have everything in its place when I get home ; a martini , dinner , the kids  --  we do n't watch much television  --  we like to read aloud to each other . We take turns . Right now we 're halfway through Catch 22 . Susan 's father died last year , so her mother is living with us now , and she enjoys hearing us read because it 's what she and my father-in-law always did , but she just listens , and the kids listen , too  --  and when we come to obscenities or sex scenes , things that can present a problem  --  we use our judgment . We used to have more friends than we do , but we do n't have that many anymore , so on weekends we might entertain a little or go over to a friend 's or come into town to see a play or a film , a foreign film . It 's not glamorous or anything . ( Pause ) There are other things besides glamor . ( JONATHAN rises and crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sits at the table . JONATHAN joins her , and SHE picks up his hand to examine it . Lights down on SANDY. ) p. 54 BOBBIE You have a long life-line . JONATHAN I like that , the way you run your nail across the inside of my  --  BOBBIE You are difficult to get along with . JONATHAN Me ? Bobbie ! BOBBIE You always know your own mind . JONATHAN ( Leers ) Right this minute , anyway . BOBBIE You wo n't stop going after what you want until you get it . JONATHAN Just because I called you four times in the last six weeks to go out with me , why would you say that ? Let 's see your hand . ( Stares at it ) BOBBIE Well ? JONATHAN You are built . BOBBIE You see that in my hand ? JONATHAN Even your hand is built . BOBBIE I think you 're a dirty old man . JONATHAN A dirty young man . How old are you ? BOBBIE How old do you think I am ? JONATHAN Twenty-three . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONATHAN Twenty-five ? BOBBIE No . JONATHAN Twenty-six ? BOBBIE No . JONATHAN Twenty-seven ? BOBBIE No JONATHAN Twenty-eight ? BOBBIE No . JONATHAN Thirty ? BOBBIE You skipped twenty-nine . JONATHAN Twenty-nine ? BOBBIE No . JONATHAN Thirty ? ( SHE nods ) I like going out with older women . BOBBIE Are you married ? JONATHAN Are you kidding ? BOBBIE You do n't want to get married ? JONATHAN I 'd marry you in a minute . Can you cook ? BOBBIE Spaghetti . JONATHAN I can cook spaghetti . p. 56 BOBBIE Good . Then you 'll do the cooking . JONATHAN What 'll you do ? BOBBIE What would you like me to do ? ( THEY both laugh ) I can sew . JONATHAN Does n't sound like much of a marriage . Me cooking spaghetti and you sewing . BOBBIE You want a divorce ? I 'll take you for every cent you 've got . JONATHAN I did n't know I was marrying a gold-digger . BOBBIE Mm  --  hmmm ! ( Nods vigorously ) JONATHAN You wo n't take pity on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONATHAN I 'm sorry . BOBBIE And you 'll never do it again . JONATHAN I 'll never do it again . BOBBIE And you 'll always be a good boy . JONATHAN Yes , Mama . BOBBIE Do you like to be mothered ? JONATHAN I 'd like to be smothered  --  by you . BOBBIE What else would you like me to do to you ? ( JONATHAN has risen and crossed over to bedroom area , which lights up ) p. 57 JONATHAN Do you like my place ? BOBBIE ( Rises and crosses to him . Bar area darkens . ) Do I like your what ? JONATHAN My  --  you know . BOBBIE What do I know ? JONATHAN You know everything . BOBBIE I know you . JONATHAN And I know you . ( HE steps forward to kiss her , but SHE turns away and slips out of her jacket , revealing , for the first time , a very large bosom ) Wow ! Will you marry me ? BOBBIE Are you rich ? JONATHAN You wo n't have to make commercials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . BOBBIE What if I 'd rather go on making commercials ? I go to such interesting places . JONATHAN ( Moves her toward bed ) Speaking of interesting places  --  BOBBIE What are you doing ? JONATHAN Think of it as a commercial . p. 58 BOBBIE Are we shooting it in bed ? JONATHAN I 'm shooting . BOBBIE And I 'm shot ? JONATHAN There are some very interesting tax benefits to this deal . BOBBIE ( Sits on bed ) Where do I sign ? JONATHAN ( Starts to undo trousers ) Wait till I get out my pen . ( BLACKOUT . Long pause . ) Oooweeeeowwwweeeoww ! ( Short pause . Lights up .

( JONATHAN gets out of bed , puts on robe ) JONATHAN I 'll be happy to tell you . ( HE walks into bathroom . Sound of shower , JONATHAN singing . ) BOBBIE ( Shouts into shower ) When I try to be practical , I 'm not romantic enough ; when I 'm romantic , they tell me to stop slobbering all over them . JONATHAN You say something ? BOBBIE I said , I 'm very happy here . You know something , Sam ? ( Shower stops ) JONATHAN ( Enters in robe , doing Bogart ) Whad ish it shweedheart ? BOBBIE You think it would be a fatal mistake in our lives if we shacked up ? ( JONATHAN freezes . A pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of weeks  --  we get along so well  --  I feel , well , very close  --  the idea  --  I like you very much , so much  --  To be perfectly honest . ( Starts to dress ) Let 's both give it a couple of days to think about it  --  it sounds like  --  well  --  very  --  well  --  good . Only our eyes should be open . If we should go into this we should know exactly what we 're getting into  --  p. 60 BOBBIE This is just a shack-up ! I 'm not asking for your hand in marriage ! JONATHAN Yeah . Well , as long as we both understand that . BOBBIE Well , we both do . JONATHAN I just thought it 's better to get it all out on the table , so later on there 's no possibility of a misunderstanding . I do n't know how many business deals I 've seen come to grief because  --  BOBBIE O.K. ! JONATHAN O.K. BOBBIE You 're a real prick , you know that ? ( JONATHAN , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bar area lights up . SANDY sits at table . JONATHAN sits . ) JONATHAN I could easily get serious about this girl , Sandy . She 's a lot of fun to be with  --  ( Pause ) This is just between the two of us , but for a year or so now I 've been having  --  I do n't know  --  a little trouble  --  I was n't worried , but still and all  --  a little trouble with , well , myself , you know , getting hard . It took a long time , and you know girls today , they judge you , they judge you very quickly . So I had some real rough times a couple of times . Some very nasty innuendoes . And as I say , I was n't too worried , but  --  I wo n't lie to you  --  I was a little worried . And then this Bobbie comes along and I get one look at the size of the pair on her , and I never had a doubt I would n't be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all our kidding back and forth our first night together , I do n't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes . p. 61 SANDY You say she 's the girl on the National Airlines commercial ? ( HE nods ) You lucky son of a bitch ! JONATHAN I do n't know  --  I do n't want to get in over my head . I got in over my head three or four times already , and you have to be a real bastard . I do n't like being put in that position . What would you do ? SANDY If she looks anything like she looks on television . JONATHAN Size 36 with a D cup . SANDY ( Takes a deep breath ) But looks are n't everything . JONATHAN Believe me , looks are everything . SANDY ( Very seriously ) Maybe . ( JONATHAN rises and crosses , with his glass , to bedroom . HE checks his watch nervously . BOBBIE enters , taking her coat off . ) JONATHAN Hi . BOBBIE I 'm late . JONATHAN How 'd it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) They gave me lines . I 'll never be a movie star . Hey , can we ever get ahold of some old movies ? p. 62 JONATHAN ( Checks his watch ) When are we gon na watch ' em ? BOBBIE Instead of watching television every night . JONATHAN I got a client who 's in distribution . I bet I can get a print of any film we want . BOBBIE Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse . JONATHAN Hey , Bobbie  --  I 'm hungry . BOBBIE Christ , have n't you eaten yet ? JONATHAN You were n't home . BOBBIE Oh , for God 's sake , you can get your own dinner when I work late ! JONATHAN There 's nothing in the house . I looked . ( Stares at her with reproach ) BOBBIE All right , let 's go out . JONATHAN You got your clothes off . BOBBIE I ' ll put them back on . JONATHAN But you 're tired .

JONATHAN What do other women do ? BOBBIE Have children . ( JONATHAN turns , walks away from her , pours a new drink ) You asked me . ( BOBBIE exits . JONATHAN crosses to chair as lights lower to a seductive glow . Music comes up : Gene Kelly singing " Our Love Is Here To Stay " from An American in Paris . JONATHAN looks front , as if watching a movie , sips at his drink , totally entranced . BOBBIE enters , in a new outfit , carrying a dinner tray which she sets on the table . JONATHAN crosses to table , still watching film . HE sits , then BOBBIE sits , perhaps lighting candles . Music continues low under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 BOBBIE I forgot . JONATHAN I 'll get it . BOBBIE You sit . JONATHAN I 'll get it . BOBBIE No , I 'll get it . ( Neither moves . Finally SHE rises and exits , then re-enters . JONATHAN eats . ) We 're out . ( SHE sits , conscious of his glare ) I 'm sorry , honey . JONATHAN It 's my fault . I knew I should have reminded you when I called this afternoon . ( Resumes eating ) BOBBIE I usually remember . JONATHAN It 's my fault . BOBBIE I 'm sorry . ( HE pushes his plate away and sits watching as SHE eats ) You 're not going to finish ? JONATHAN I was really depending on that beer . BOBBIE I 'm too tired to run down for beer at this hour of the night , Jonathan . JONATHAN I 'll go . BOBBIE Do you mind ? I 'm really exhausted .

JONATHAN You want to make love ( Pause ) We have n't in a week . BOBBIE Is it a week ? I 'll take the phone off the hook . JONATHAN I 'll do that . You get ready . BOBBIE You get ready . ( SHE crosses into bathroom . HE crosses to chair , sits with newspaper , holding it in his lap . While HE reads , there is a steady hand movement under the paper which makes a rhythmic thwacking sound . BLACKOUT. ) p. 66 BOBBIE ( In dark ) Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swell . You 're not hard yet . ( Pause ) That 's all right . JONATHAN It takes a while . BOBBIE That 's all right . JONATHAN Do that again . That 's nice . Mm . Mm . Mm . Yeah . Yeah ! ( A five-second series of quick grunts . Pause . ) BOBBIE Already ? ( Lights up in bathroom . The sound of shower . ) JONATHAN ( From shower , singing ) " It 's very clear . My love is here to stay . " ( Lights up . BOBBIE in bed . SHE turns over . JONATHAN enters through front door in business suit . HE rushes to phone , which stops ringing . ) What are you still doing in bed ? BOBBIE What time is it ? JONATHAN Six-thirty . BOBBIE What are you doing up at six-thirty ? JONATHAN P.M. BOBBIE Funny man . p. 67 JONATHAN Look , it 's dark outside . BOBBIE Six-thirty in the morning is dark , too . JONATHAN Sandy and Susan are coming to dinner . The place is a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , re-enters angry ) JONATHAN There ' s nothing in the house to eat ! BOBBIE ( Returns his glare coldly and dials phone . SHE listens and hangs up , stunned . ) It 's six-thirty ! JONATHAN You have n't been in bed since nine o'clock this morning ? I 'm gon na ask Sandy to take a look at you ! BOBBIE I do n't need a doctor . JONATHAN Maybe it 's psychological . Is anything bothering you ? BOBBIE No . JONATHAN Jesus , if you sleep sixteen hours out of the day . BOBBIE Well  --  one thing actually , but  --  ( Yawns and stretches ) JONATHAN Wow BOBBIE What ? JONATHAN When you yawn that way  --  and those bazooms of yours inflate . ( BOBBIE covers herself ) Do n't ! Goddamn barrage balloons ! Will you please snap it up ? ( Door chimes . HE starts toward front door . ) Snap it up ! p. 68 BOBBIE What are you going to do with me the day they begin to sag ? ( HE crosses to front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lights up on front door . SANDY enters . ) JONATHAN You 're looking good . SANDY You 're looking good . JONATHAN Susan get held up ? SANDY I could use a martini . Susan ca n't make it . JONATHAN Nobody makes martinis like Bobbie . ( Shouts ) Bobbie ! Susan sick ? SANDY You know how it is . JONATHAN It 's been like only three times since your wedding . That 's ten years . SANDY One of these days . Say , how about that drink ? JONATHAN Yeah . Listen , I originally thought we 'd have dinner here , but maybe you 'd rather eat out . SANDY Whatever you say . JONATHAN Bobbie 's a little down  --  so maybe as long as Susan could n't make it  --  just you and me , we 'll go out  --  SANDY I 'm not gon na meet Bobbie ? p. 69 JONATHAN Well , she 's a little under the weather . SANDY I really wanted to meet her . What seems to be the trouble ? JONATHAN You know how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her . JONATHAN She just did n't get out of bed today . SANDY Let me take a look . JONATHAN ( Suspicious ) Why ? SANDY Jonathan  --  I 'm also a doctor . JONATHAN Why not . ( HE crosses to bedroom area , which remains dark . SANDY paces , crosses to phone , dials , telephone rings . ) SUSAN 'S VOICE Hello ? Hello ? ( A pause ) Sandy ? ( HE very quietly hangs up . JONATHAN returns . ) SANDY ( Turns away ) I really could use that drink . JONATHAN She says she 's O.K. , but if you want to take a look  --  SANDY What ? JONATHAN Bobbie . SANDY Sure . ( HE starts for bedroom ) My drink . ( SANDY crosses to bedroom . JONATHAN goes about straightening chairs. ) p. 70 JONATHAN What does she do ? ( HE mixes drinks . SANDY returns . JONATHAN hands him drink . ) SANDY I 'm having her come into the office tomorrow morning for a checkup . Her blood pressure 's a little low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SANDY She 's attractive , all right . Just like you said . ( Hands him empty glass ) You got any more of these ? ( JONATHAN pours drink . SANDY drinks . ) She 's a stunning girl you got there . ( Drinks ) It must be very exciting to meet girls like that all the time . ( Drinks ) It 's funny . Susan and I do all the right things . We undress in front of each other . We spend fifteen minutes on foreplay . We experiment . Do it in different rooms . It 's a seven-room house . We do n't believe in making a ritual of it . We do it when we feel like it . We 're considerate of each other 's feelings . We try to be patient  --  and we are  --  with each other . ( Pause ) Maybe it 's just not meant to be enjoyable with women you love . ( Pause ) JONATHAN You want too much . SANDY Sometime this month I started seeing myself in the third person . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all get that from time to time . SANDY Do you get a commentator ? JONATHAN A what ? SANDY Suddenly I 've got a a broadcaster living inside my head . Doing a play-by-play of my life . " O.K. , there 's Sandy hopping youthfully off the Long Island as it pulls into Great Neck . Would you believe he 's past thirty ? And who 's that coming at him , a warm smile on her face ? It 's good old Susan ! " JONATHAN Yeah ? Go on  --  SANDY " Sandy bends over and kisses her . And Susan is talking , she has things to say : she organized a new street safety committee today and she canvassed for Civil Rights today and she talked three times to the police about  --  about what ? Sandy missed it . About a missing husband ? Has Susan sent the police looking for Sandy ? They 'll never find him . He 's hiding inside a smiling doctor . Now Susan has stopped talking and she 's waiting for Sandy to talk . Sandy must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order not to talk , Sandy interviews his wife until they get home . And now , running madly toward him with their arms open wide for money are Sandy 's children : Larry , Moe , and Curly . Susan , the wife , gives a big mother 's smile . Sandy reads her smile to mean , ' I 've got three little boys and one big boy . ' And Sandy notices for the first time that Susan is getting to look like his mother . And he all of a sudden sees his whole marriage is like a rerun of a movie he saw as a kid called Sandy 's Parents  --  and here 's Sandy playing his father , knowing the lines by heart , and here 's Susan playing his mother  --  or maybe her mother  --  and the kids are doing Sandy at ages three , five , and seven . And Sandy thinks of the money and years spent on his education , on her education , his career , her community work  --  and it all ends up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn , bright and early before Frank , Sammy , and Dino are awake . He very quietly packs a suitcase . He very quietly calls a cab . Susan very quietly asks what he 's up to . " And then  --  and then , Jonathan , my wife and I talked . We just talked as if it was the most natural thing for two people married ten years to do . And you know what ? She 's as crazy as I am . Just as bored . Dislikes the kids as much . A perfect match . And we kiss  --  I mean really kiss  --  and hole each other , and I 'm telling her I do n't want to go and she 's begging me not to go , and I 'm thinking to myself : There 's no one like this , there 's no marriage like this , what a mistake I nearly made . And the commentator inside my head says , " Very good . Now cry to indicate suffering . " So I grabbed my suitcase and got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new drink ) p. 72 JONATHAN It 's the smartest thing you ever did . ( SANDY smiles ruefully ) I never told you this , but I was never that crazy about her . ( SANDY nods ) Tomorrow we get you laid . BLACKOUT p. 73 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT II : Scene 2 A Ping-Pong game . JONATHAN and SANDY playing . BOBBIE and CINDY , hard and sexy , in her mid-twenties , looking on . ALL are dressed in summer outfits . After a volley , JONATHAN serves . SANDY catches ball . NOTE : Due to the obvious staging difficulties , the game can be shortened and played off-stage . SANDY My serve . JONATHAN What 's the score ? SANDY Eighteen  --  fifteen , mine . ( HE serves . THEY volley . When JONATHAN loses a point , HE cries , " Shit ! " or " Bitch ! " or " Son of a bitch ! " or " Bastard ! " HE is playing at the beginning of the scene with some grimness . When HE misses HE turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that ? " or " That should have been on " or " Ask Bobbie , I 've never played like this before , Cindy . " At one point , while still behind , HE says to SANDY , " Let 's switch rackets . " EVERYBODY jeers , and HE turns it into a joke . " I 'm just kidding ! " HE plays dramatically , moves in and out , back and forth a lot , slips once or twice to a chorus of either cheers or jeers from BOBBIE and CINDY , depending on whether or not HE 's made his shot . HE plays to his audience as SANDY does not . SANDY plays efficiently , almost mechanically . HE reacts with a grimace when HE makes a point . HE will comment only flatteringly on JONATHAN 's shots . " Good shot " or " Nice try " or " Too bad " or " That should have been on . " BOBBIE is bored early in the game and drops out of the cheering section midway , leaving it to CINDY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wins , groaning over his losses . JONATHAN directs his remarks increasingly to CINDY . BOBBIE is bothered by this at some point late in the game and walks away . JONATHAN , as HE continues play , cries , " Where you going ? ! " and BOBBIE returns . If a shot just nicks the edge of the table and the shot is JONATHAN 's , HE should insist it hit while SANDY more quietly insists it did not . If the shot is SANDY 's , their claims are reversed . A final appeal is made to the GIRLS , who say , " I did n't see it . " " Do it over . " JONATHAN ties the score and crows , " Now I get going . " Each time HE scores a point HE says , " Now I 'm moving " or " This is more like it " or " Now I mean business . " As HE pulls ahead of SANDY , HE becomes good humored . HE cries , " Nine points ahead . He was actually nine points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANDY slams the paddle on the table . It is his only display of emotion and HE quickly covers for it by saying , " Good shot . " The next ball HE hits into the net , obviously throwing the point . CINDY qroans , runs to SANDY and ostentatiously kisses him . THEY hug each other for a moment. ) p. 74 JONATHAN Cindy , want to take me on ? CINDY Well  --  BOBBIE It 's my turn . JONATHAN Oh , come on , Bobbie , you 're so awful . O.K. SANDY Go ahead . CINDY ( To SANDY ) You sure you do n't want to ? ( SHE picks up racket ) JONATHAN You serve . ( SHE wins first point ) Very nice . ( SHE wins second point ) You play well . ( SHE wins third point ) Hey , Sandy , will you look at this girl ? ( SHE wins fourth point ) Hey , she 's racking me up . Will you look at this ? ( SHE wins fifth point ) Hey , come on , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . ) Six  --  nothing . And I 'm not taking it easy on her , either . ( SHE wins seventh point ) No kidding , you 're great  --  but if you used your backhand more on the shots to your left , you wo n't leave your right side so open  --  ( Another volley ) Say , is that true what Sandy says  --  you hate your job  --  maybe I can find something for you . ( THEY volley excitedly ) BLACKOUT p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT II : Scene 3 The bedroom . Lights are low on bed , up on shower . Sound of water running . Lights slowly up on bed . BOBBIE sits propped on pillows , glaring at shower . Sound of shower dies . JONATHAN emerges from bathroom in robe , crosses to bed-table , starts looking through drawers , slamming them shut . BOBBIE What are you looking for ? ( HE does n't answer ) JONATHAN I have it . ( Takes tie out of dresser ) It 's not supposed to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of drawer , reads it . ) You and Lord &amp; Taylor are going to have to work out a trial separation . ( SHE reaches for bill . HE hands it to her . SHE examines it and hands it back . ) BOBBIE Look at the date . JONATHAN What do you mean ? BOBBIE Five months ago . ( HE puts bill back in drawer and continues dressing ) I 'm sorry I cost you so much money . ( The phone rings ) JONATHAN Will you get that ? BOBBIE You 're closer . ( Phone continues to ring . NEITHER answers . Phone stops . JONATHAN glares . ) I want to get married . ( HE enters bathroom and loudly slams door . After a moment , HE exits from bathroom , ripping off his tie . HE leaves the room and re-enters with a handful of ties. ) p. 76 JONATHAN What have you done with all my silk ties ? ( HE goes through ties , scattering the rejects on the floor and bed ) BOBBIE Are you tired of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need more in life than this . JONATHAN Who put you up to this ? Your psychiatrist ? After a long , exhaustive bed-hunt , you 've chosen me . BOBBIE Cindy 's not a virgin , either . JONATHAN What ? Oh , I get it ! Is that what brought this on ? Your mind is unbelievable ! You really have to have a low opinion of me  --  thinking I 'd do that to Sandy . BOBBIE No , you would n't want to cheat on Sandy . JONATHAN Oh-ho  --  now it 's Sandy . BOBBIE He spends half his life over here . JONATHAN Wait a minute  --  a second ago you had me screwing Cindy . Who 'm I screwing now ? Sandy ? How about Cindy and Sandy ? Talk about the pot calling the kettle . The day I got an earful of your checkered past , I felt like a celibate . BOBBIE You made me tell you . JONATHAN Sure  --  I twisted your arm . p. 77 BOBBIE It got you hot . JONATHAN Well , something has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bottle on bed-table , downs it with glass of water . ) BOBBIE One .

Say , Sandy , as long as I have you , how many Seconals does it take to kill someone ? Well , who , if not my doctor ? Come off it , your friend Jonathan 's a lot more likely to knock himself off than I am . If I do n't do the job for him Because I 've taken two of the teeny ones and I still ca n't sleep Well , yes , I did nap  --  from one until six . But I 've still got to sleep at night or I 'm a wreck the whole next day . So how many more of these can I take without  --  you know ? ( Playful ) Sandy , if you do n't tell me , I 'll start mixing them with Scotch Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , if they 're that bad for me , why do you prescribe them ? All right , do n't get excited . No , I 'm not depressed . Yes Yes Fine . ( SHE hangs up quickly as JONATHAN enters with martini ) JONATHAN Yackety yak " And you know what else he did to me ? " " What ? I ca n't believe it , the bastard ! " p. 78 BOBBIE You have such contempt for me . JONATHAN Kid , you worked hard for it , it 's yours . BOBBIE The way you paw me at parties . JONATHAN Oh , I get it . Now affection is contempt . Upside down . BOBBIE Feeling me up in public is not affection . JONATHAN Will you come on ! BOBBIE I know I sleep all day  --  I know I 'm doing a terrible job  --  But you 're not helping me any . JONATHAN And who helps me ? BOBBIE I help you . JONATHAN Your kind of help I can do without .

I do n't own a prick anymore . It 's all yours . You 're the one that gets hard , you 're the one that comes inside you . I 'm just the handle to your pecker . That 's all I am .

SHE stares at door , then takes pills and downs them with water. ) p. 79 BOBBIE Five  --  six  --  seven  --  JONATHAN ( Exits from bathroom ) You 'll do anything you can to ruin my day , wo n't you ? I came home feeling so good  --  ( HE takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave us alone . We were doing so well  --  BOBBIE What ? ! JONATHAN At one time ! At one time it was great what we had .

CINDY A little or a lot ? JONATHAN ( Spreads hands ) This much . CINDY ( Gives him a long , measuring stare ) I 'm surprised it took you this long to get around to it . Tell Sandy we have a party to go to . JONATHAN Sandy 's busy . CINDY You and Sandy have it all worked out . ( Puts on her coat ) You want to come around sometime by yourself , that 's one thing . I 've been expecting that . But you tell Sandy if he lays one hand on that tub of lard in there not to come home . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( SHE exits . JONATHAN stands there frozen , then mixes drink , starts to sit down , suddenly stands again . ) JONATHAN Sandy and Bobbie ! ( HE dashes for bedroom . SANDY , on phone , stands over unconscious BOBBIE . ) SANDY She 's semi-comatose . Better send a resuscitator and an airway . Who 's on ? O.K. , tell Portis to be ready to give her an I.V . on admission . ( Hangs up ) You told me she did n't take any pills . ( SANDY glares at JONATHAN , who turns and flees ) Bastard . ( JONATHAN stumbles to living room , sits , rises , paces , drinks , sits , rises ) p. 89 JONATHAN Very slick  --  very clever  --  ( Screams ) @x The stage is BLACK . JONATHAN ( Hums a ceremonial movie newsreel intro . ) **33;1403;TOOLONG . Jonathan Fuerst presents A Jonathan Fuerst Production : Ballbusters on Parade . A slide appears against a backdrop . A black-and-white photo of a 10-year-old girl , circa 1930s . JONATHAN That 's Bonnie , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started exposing ourselves to each other at ten . We got caught on the roof one day by my mother . She washed my mouth out with soap . I could never get the connection . Slides change in sync with commentary . They are crude black-and-white Brownie photos of young children . JONATHAN Here 's Emily . She was my first steady , until she moved off the block at eleven . I never laid a hand on her . Mildred I think this one 's name is . She followed me around in school . The fellows kidded me about her . I warned her I 'd beat her up if she did n't stop . She picked up her skirt , dropped her pants , and shoved her ass at me . So my first sight of ass was twelve . Here 's Marcia . Thirteen and a half , or thereabouts . I kissed her at a spin-the-bottle party . You ever hear of spin-the-bottle , Daisy ? Lights up in JONATHAN 'S bachelor apartment . Far more chic and hi-tech than his place with BOBBIE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sits next to SANDY , who has aged not at all . SANDY wears a beard , dresses modishly ; his hair is longer , and love beads hang from around his neck . DAISY is young , eighteen or twenty , a hippie : long hair , a long dress , bare arms , and bare feet . The three sit side by side in the half-dark , downstage , facing the audience . They stare straight ahead watching the slide show , which from now on will not be seen . JONATHAN holds a remote switch in his hand , and each time he switches a slide the reflected light changes on everyone 's face . p. 91 JONATHAN ( To SANDY ) I thought she was your daughter when you first came in , you son of a bitch . SANDY In a lot of ways , Daisy 's older than I am . JONATHAN As if that takes much . SANDY Like old times ! JONATHAN This one 's Rosalie . I think this one was after you moved on the block , Sandy  --  SANDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor in National Velvet . You ever hear of National Velvet , Daisy ? ( No response ) But you have heard of Elizabeth Taylor ? ( No response ) I had a crush on Rosalie from fourteen to fifteen . I never went near her . SANDY We thought she was too good for us . JONATHAN In those days , we had illusions . This is Charlotte , a real prick-tease . Not much on looks , but great tits for fifteen . I could never get myself to kiss her . Too dirty . But a good feel . SANDY That 's Lenny Hartman 's sister , is n't it ? JONATHAN She was my first French-kiss . Sixteen years old . p. 92 SANDY Soul-kissing , we called it then . JONATHAN That 's right , soul-kissing . ( JONATHAN laughs ) I 'll tell you the truth , I do n't see anybody anymore . ( Looks at SANDY ) I 'm glad we can be friends again . SANDY I wanted to call you lots of times . JONATHAN Me , too . Hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuck you . JONATHAN Here 's Gloria . The best-built girl in Evander Childs . I took her to the Bronx Zoo once , and on the bus copped a cheap feel . A real prick-tease . Here 's Gwen . I went with her almost a year trying to get her to put out . But she thought I was too nice and was saving me for marriage . Every guy at Evander must 've gotten into her pants except me . Here we have my very first fu  --  ( A brief glimpse of SUSAN . JONATHAN hits the remote quickly and goes past it . SANDY looks at him sharply . ) No . That one 's a mistake . Here 's Eileen , my very first fuck . She was a modern dancer at Swarthmore . Great body on her , but wasted . She was frigid . Here 's Nancy , a sweet kid . Went into biology . Very frigid . ( JONATHAN looks over at SANDY a little uncertainly and finds him staring at him ) You really look happy , you son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . JONATHAN And you 're still happy ? Page No . III-4 is missing . JONATHAN ( Stares front . Switches slide . ) Ah , here she is : the Queen of the Ballbusters . What the hell was her name again ? Cindy ! An old friend of your boyfriend , Daisy . SANDY You give off such bad vibrations . JONATHAN " Bad vibrations . " Sandy , I love you , I missed you , but you 're a schmuck . Well , you were always young , Sandy . Open . You were schmucky a lot of the time , but maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open . Do n't make me mad at you . Listen , do n't listen to me . You 're doing great , and I 'm making money . That 's what gets it up for me now . SANDY You can find what I found , Jonathan . I was just as hung up as you . Daisy showed me . Let me talk to her about you . JONATHAN I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out everything we were taught to believe is the right way . But I do n't know , with God terminal and the country falling to pieces , maybe it 's important to believe in something . Even if it 's your own generation 's bullshit . ( Switches slides . Looks front . ) Here 's a real cunt . I forget her name . A Nazi . I banged her in Berlin . I do n't know how this one got mixed up in here . This is my little girl , Wendy . " Princess , " I call her . Is n't she a dreamboat ? This tramp I banged first in a yacht race to Nassau . A real prick-tease . I do n't remember her name . ( To SANDY ) I 'll tell you something , Sandy . After forty years , I learned that I 'd rather be with you than any broad I know . Hold it : I 'd rather fuck them . Tell that to Tondelayo over there . ( Looks front ) This vulture I lived with a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that Oriental girls were different . Not in America , they 're not . ( SANDY rises and exits , almost surreptitiously , without JONATHAN noticing ) Here 's my one colored girl . As great a body as I 've ever seen , but the last one I ever laid a finger on . Too hostile . My fatal mistake is to confuse my liking pussy for liking girls . Here 's a sixteen year old I paid twenty bucks to one night when I was drunk in the Village . Maybe you know her , Daisy . She gave me a dose . ( JONATHAN hits the remote switch , and the light from the screen goes out , leaving the stage in darkness . ) Th-th-th-th-that 's all , folks . ( When the lights come up , JONATHAN is standing next to a lamp staring at DAISY , who is looking at him with great sadness ) Where 'd Sandy go ? ( DAISY rises and crosses to JONATHAN . She takes his hand and holds it tenderly . ) What are you crying for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him long and tenderly . He pulls away . ) What 's the matter with you ? ( Turns to go upstage ) Sandy , where the hell are you ? ( Exits ) Sandy ? ( Re-enters ) His coat is gone . Where 'd he go ? Sandy ? Sandy ? ( As if to a retarded child ) Go ? Where ? Where  --  go  --  Sandy ? ( DAISY starts to undress . JONATHAN laughs . ) Jesus Christ . ( Laughs ) Finally , we 're playing swap ! But I 've got nobody for Sandy , Daisy . It just would n't be fair . ( DAISY continues to undress ) Look , I appreciate the gesture  --  I ca n't stand it . I appreciate the gesture , Daisy . ( DAISY drops to her knees and moves to undo his pants . He backs off , laughing . ) I do n't want to hurt your feelings , Daisy ; it does n't help . ( Laughs ) I ca n't fucking believe this . ( Stops suddenly ) Daisy , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it works . ( Mischievously , he rolls up a newspaper and strikes it several times against his hand ) Down on your knees , Daisy . ( SHE stares at him sadly for a moment , then slowly sinks to her knees and bows her head . HE raises the rolled newspaper as if to strike . ) No , Daisy  --  I was  --  I was only fooling around  --  it 's even worse than that . ( HE hands her the rolled newspaper ) You have to do it to me . ( SHE drops the paper ) It 's the only thing that works , Daisy . ( HE picks it up and hands it to her ) We 're talking about love now , Daisy . ( HE takes off his shirt and bares his back to her . SHE raises the newspaper and brings it down very lightly , barely touching him . HE turns gently and takes it from her . ) I was just testing your love , Daisy  --  because what I really want you to do  --  I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame you if you do n't  --  but it 's the one thing that 's guaranteed to work . First , you pee on me  --  do n't back away , Daisy  --  and if that does n't do it , I 'll pee on you . And if your peeing on me and my peeing on you does n't work  --  you know what we 'll try next , Daisy ? We 'll take it one step further . Where are you going , Daisy ? ( SHE lets out a strangled cry and flees . HE runs to exit and shouts after her . ) Daisy ! What about love ? ! ( Laughs uproariously as HE crosses to bar . HE fixes two drinks as LOUISE enters . SHE is a striking looking woman in her thirties , dressed like a stylish hooker . HE hands her a drink , still chuckling . ) Women ! p. 94 LOUISE All ball-busters , right ? JONATHAN You know it . When you think of what he 's got to dip into , any guy with a conscience has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise ? LOUISE You 're always right , lover . ( Hands him a drink , then kisses him ) I do n't think we 're going to have any trouble tonight . JONATHAN You do n't ? LOUISE No , I do n't . JONATHAN Are you sure ? LOUISE Wan na bet ? JONATHAN How much ? LOUISE Sky 's the limit . JONATHAN Goddamnit ! ( Pulls away ) LOUISE What did I do ? JONATHAN You 're doing it all wrong ! LOUISE I 'm doing it like always . JONATHAN You never said that before . LOUISE Said what ? JONATHAN " Sky 's the limit " ! LOUISE Sure I did . JONATHAN Never ! I know what I wrote . p. 95 LOUISE What do I say ? JONATHAN You forgot your lines . LOUISE ( Remembering ) " A hundred . " ( HE begins to calm down ) I say " a hundred . " JONATHAN O.K. LOUISE It just came out . JONATHAN I want it right , that 's all . LOUISE I do n't think we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUISE No , I do n't . JONATHAN Are you sure ? LOUISE Wan na bet ? JONATHAN How much ? LOUISE A hundred ? JONATHAN You sound pretty sure . ( HE takes a couple of bills from his trouser pocket and hands them to her . SHE puts them away . ) LOUISE Your kind of man ? Why should n't I be sure ? JONATHAN What kind of man am I ? LOUISE A real man . A kind man . p. 96 JONATHAN I 'm not kind . ( During the course of her speech , LOUISE begins to undress and caress a totally passive JONATHAN )
