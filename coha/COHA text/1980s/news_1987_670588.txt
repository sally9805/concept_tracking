It is a formidable task , fraught with extreme emotional as well as physical challenges that can easily strain the capabilities and sap the energy of the most stalwart . But according to those who have provided care for AIDS patients , it can also be extremely rewarding to know you have done everything you could to make the remaining days as pleasant as possible for someone you love. // Thoughtful , creative care can increase the comfort and may even prolong the lives of those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome . As Leonard J. Martelli puts it in " When Someone You Know Has AIDS : A Practical Guide " : " If your friend has AIDS , you can do little , medically , to influence the course of the disease or to change your friend ' s health . What you can greatly influence , however , is the quality of your friend ' s life . Many persons with AIDS attribute the fact that they are alive and happy today to the caring friends and care partners who stepped in and helped them make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the partners through each stage of the disease , was written with Fran D. Peltz and William Messina and published last June by Crown ( $15. 95 hard cover ; $9. 95 paperback ) . // Here are some guidelines for caring for AIDS patients at home . They are derived from interviews with men and women who have been care partners ; from Mr. Martelli ' s book ; from the AIDS Project Los Angeles text , " AIDS : A Self-Care Manual , " edited by BettyClare Moffatt , Judith Spiegel , Steve Parrish and Michael Helquist and published last month by IBS Press ( $12. 95 paperback ) , and from Helen Kane , a registered nurse who teaches a course on home care for AIDS patients through the American Red Cross in Greater New York. // Be cheerful but realistic . Meg Coffee , who cared for her husband , John , a hemophiliac who died of AIDS , suggests : " Do as many things as possible that you enjoy . Have people over whom you like . Watch funny movies . Read funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking books . " Richard Dulong cared for his lover , Paul Popham , the founding president of the Gay Men ' s Health Crisis in New York , before his death . Mr. Dulong said he bought a " big , beautiful color TV and rented and borrowed lots of videotapes , mostly comedies . " He also kept fresh flowers in the house and raised the blinds to let in as much daylight as possible. // Mrs. Coffee , a public-relations consultant in Westport , Conn. , said she believes that when people are really sick , what they most want is to be talked to as if everything were normal . " I always tried to remember that John was my husband , not my patient , " she said . But she cautioned against denying that the disease is terminal : " That only makes it harder for the person who is sick . It ' s better to tell the person how you feel , that you ' re scared for them , that you don ' t really want them to die. " // Enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , but you ' re likely to burn out quickly if you have no one to relieve you temporarily and no one to give you moral and emotional support . Mr. Dulong said that when Mr. Popham became too sick to work , he was himself ill with an AIDS-related cancer . But friends came in daily to help with the cooking and cleaning , and Mr. Popham ' s mother and sister also visited from time to time. // Local AIDS support groups can often send volunteers who can provide a welcome distraction and perhaps give the care partner a few hours off. // Mrs. Coffee said it is important for the principal care-giver to maintain some semblance of a normal life - to go out with friends , for example , or pursue some hobby , if only for a few hours a week . She also suggested asking the Visiting Nurse Association and home health aides to provide professional guidance . " Therapy and counseling can be very helpful to care-givers , who need an objective listener to help them work through the inevitable anxieties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important concern . Any patient is far more comfortable when clean and dry , and AIDS patients in particular must be protected from contagious illnesses that their depressed immune systems can not fight off . Anyone with symptoms of a cold or other illness should wear a mask to protect the patient. // Care-givers have found that protecting themselves was not as difficult as it seemed at first , but they emphasize that the care-givers should make every effort to avoid becoming infected with the AIDS virus. // Ms. Kane , the registered nurse , said that the most important rule is to wash your hands often , especially before and after ministering to the patient and handling food . Disposable rubber gloves are useful when dealing with the patient ' s body fluids and excretions or when bathing the patient . Otherwise , in routine care , gloves are needed only if the care partner has a cut or an open sore on his hands. // Many AIDS patients eventually experience incontinence . Disposable bed pads can be used , and for men , what is called a condom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When cleaning up soiled bedding , wear a washable full-body apron and disposable gloves . Flush all bodily wastes down the toilet , and disinfect the bowl with a solution of 1 part chlorine bleach to 10 parts water . ( The AIDS virus is very fragile and is easily killed outside the body . ) Also use this mild bleach solution for cleaning the patient ' s clothes , bedding and any household equipment that might touch the patient ' s body fluids . You need not use disposable dishes , glasses and utensils , but wash all kitchenware with hot , soapy water ( some bleach can be added ) or in a dishwasher. // Plastic shower chairs are useful for those too weak to stand in a shower or to climb into a tub . Use sponge baths for patients who can not get out of bed . Always use very mild soap , and after drying the patient , apply powder and lotion to reduce skin irritation. // If a toothbrush is too abrasive , clean the patient ' s mouth with a washcloth or Toothettes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safer than a blade . No one should share the patient ' s towels , washcloths , soap or razor. // Experts are divided over the advisability of keeping pets . While it would be unwise to bring in a new pet , Ms. Kane and others suggest keeping any pet the patient already has . But they also note that the patient should avoid contact with a pet ' s excretions or litter box . Providing nourishment . As AIDS progresses , patients lose their appetites , may be nauseated frequently or become too fatigued to eat . The inevitable result is emaciation . The best bet is to give patients the foods they want , without fretting over how little they consume . Mrs. Coffee recalled spending hours preparing her husband ' s favorite meal , only to have him take just three bites . " You can ' t think , ' How dare you - I worked so hard on this , ' because the patient can ' t help it , " she said. // Mr. Dulong found one solution : " I always kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Paul would eat them if nothing else . " To help thwart weight loss , he kept a supply of canned nutritional supplements like Sustacal or Ensure. // Buy or rent useful equipment . Many patients are more comfortable in a rented hospital bed that can be manipulated electrically . You can also rent wheelchairs , walkers and oxygen tanks . An " egg carton " mattress , with individual air pockets , can help prevent bedsores. // Giving tender , loving care . " Don ' t be afraid to touch the patient , " Mrs. Coffee said . " You don ' t get AIDS from hugging someone . Massages are also very relaxing and therapeutic . When John became too emaciated to enjoy a body massage , I massaged his feet and his head. " // Try to get the patient out as much as his stamina will tolerate - to movies , concerts , plays , restaurants , museums or religious services . Mr. Dulong took Mr. Popham to the movies in the afternoon , when there were few people and no lines . Enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care . You can also invite friends over for dinner or simply for coffee or to watch television. // As AIDS progresses , it can be increasingly difficult for the care partner to feel tender and loving because the patient is apt to become more and more cantankerous , if not downright hostile . Such personality changes are part of the disease , not a sign of ingratitude. // For further assistance . The American Red Cross in Greater New York offers a free six-session course for families and friends of AIDS patients who provide home care . The next two sessions begin on Nov. 3 and Nov. 17 .
