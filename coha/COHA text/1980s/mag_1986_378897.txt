Though the U.S. has banned arms sales to Iran since the outbreak of the hostage crisis in 1979 , Washington has long suspected that American weapons are still finding their way to Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini 's Shi'ite armies . Last week the Justice Department unveiled a web of smuggling plots that would have netted Iran $2.5 billion worth of U.S. equipment . Federal authorities filed conspiracy charges against 17 people , including a London-based American lawyer and a retired Israeli general . It was the biggest arms bust that the feds had ever staged . <P> Prosecutors said the undone deals involve a veritable supermarket of weaponry : 18 F-4 and 13 F-5 fighter aircraft , five C-130E transport planes , more than 20 helicopters and thousands of missiles . Iran spent $17 billion on U.S. military equipment under the Shah in the 1970s , and is desperate to get new supplies and parts to continue waging its 5-year war of attrition with Iraq . It stands ready to deal with anyone who can deliver . <P> The man who located several such prospective suppliers , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who practices corporate law out of offices on London 's fashionable Grosvenor Place . Evans allegedly found three groups that could obtain U.S. arms abroad , mostly in Israel . <P> Evans was one of ten men arrested and held without bail last week . Five of them were seized in Bermuda , where , U.S. officials said , they were meeting to work out details of two of the deals . Another participant in the session was retired Israeli Brigadier General Avraham Baram , 52 , a former tank commander . His presence raised questions about possible official involvement by Israel , which ran a profitable aboveboard arms trade with Iran until 1979 . Even though the Khomeini regime is a sworn enemy of Israel , Jerusalem views the drawn-out war as a useful drain on the resources of Iraq , a closer and more dangerous foe . Baram insisted that the Israeli " defense establishment " was aware of his activities . But the Israeli Defense Ministry quickly denied any " direct , indirect or tacit connection , " and when Baram telephoned the Israeli embassy in Washington to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simhony told him curtly , " Buddy , you better get yourself the best legal advice available .
