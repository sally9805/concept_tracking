word hung in the air like an obscenity . " And you were n't sure , " said Torisen softly . " Like father , like son , eh ? " Burr flinched . " Do n't be daft , " Harn said impatiently , with no apparent sense of incongruity . " You 've got trouble enough without trying to tear strips off of us . Nusair is dead , and his father is going to accuse you of his murder . That means a blood feud , you against the entire house of Caineron , unless the High Council takes pity and declares you insane . Either way , we wo n't march against the Horde , and that , ultimately , may mean the end of us all . " " But , sir , will the Council really take Caineron 's word against the Highlord 's ? " Burr asked . Torisen gave a bitter laugh . " Most of them will probably be delighted to .

Now Caineron will promise them everything , or seem to . What 's the alternative ? A mad lord from a mad line who has only kept the peace and satisfied no one . " " So what do we do ? " " If Caineron tells his story first , with me shut up here unable to refute it , my power will be broken forever . Caineron knows that . So I 've got to reach Gothregor before he does . " " Ride ? Tonight ? Are you strong enough ? " Torisen stood up , slowly , carefully , fighting down a fresh surge of dizziness . His face was bleak , as if stripped to the iron core of his will . " I can do anything I have to . " The randon gave him a hard look , then nodded . " Yes . You always could . " Burr brought his lord 's riding coat and the saddlebag full of bones . At the back of the apartment was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . It was still open only a crack . Torisen stopped short , his hand on it . Somewhere in the passageways beyond the guarded door , a voice had cried out in pain . " Who ... ? " " Kindrie , I think , " said the randon . His expression hard/ened . " Caineron said something in the fire-timber hall about giving him his back pay tonight . " " He pays a Highborn wages ? " said Burr , blankly . " For Kithorn , yes . " The cry came again , wilder , bitten off in midnote . Burr took an involuntary step toward the door , but Harn caught his arm . " We ca n't help him now . Besides , he 's buying us time , and I think he knows it . " Old Tentir was riddled with secret passageways . Caineron 's spies had apparently never discovered this , but Harn had made himself master of their hidden ways within weeks of his arrival . The stone stairway plunged down between dank walls in steps so narrow that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torch in his hand , his bulk nearly filling the passageway . Some thirty feet down , he put his shoulder to the wall , forced open another concealed panel , and squeezed through . The other two followed him out into the subterranean stable . Feet rustled on straw , and seven of Caineron 's retainers surrounded them , steel drawn . " We 're sorry , my lord , " the eldest of them said apologetically , " but our lord insists that you stay . " The shadows moved behind him . Something clipped the man on the side of the head . He dropped without a sound . The others turned , startled , and another one of them went down with a grunt before the singer 's iron-shod staff . " Ashe ! " exclaimed Harn , and sprang forward to help . He nearly collided with a cadet vaulting over one of the wooden partitions . Four more followed , all Knorths , all survivors of the timber hall fight . Torisen sat down on a bale of hay to watch . Let someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in no shape to help . " Do n't let me hinder you , " he said politely to Burr . The Kendar only grunted . Clearly , the cadets did n't need the help of the veteran randon . Ham had indeed trained them well . The battle was over before any of Caineron 's people had even thought to give the alarm . " I 'm glad to see you finally remember who I am , " said the singer to Harn as they bound and gagged the fallen Kendar . " After that blank stare you gave me in the fire-timber hall , I thought your wits had finally gone missing . "  | " No , just on a long hike . Ashe and I were cadets and onehundredcaptains together with the Southern Host long before you were born , " he said to Torisen . " She gave up her commissionafter an axe blow nearly took off her leg , although I still say a good healer could have lessened the damage . The fool would never see one . " The Highlord rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , singer , I 'm still in your debt . How may I repay you ? " " My lord , I do n't know what 's going on , but there must be a song in it somewhere . I 'll ride with you , if you 're willing . " " May we too , my lord ? " asked a cadet eagerly . Torisen glanced at the bound Kendar . " After this , you had better . " " Right , " said Ham briskly . " Saddle up , then , and two of you go see if you can get the main gate open before we run into it nose first . " " You never answered the question I asked you in the tower , " Torisen reminded him . " Eh ? Oh . " Harn went down clumsily on one knee in the straw . " I will serve you , my lord , in any way that you require . Now and forever . " He looked up under bristling bows . " Besides , any fool who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . " " I reconfirm our bond and seal it with blood , " said Torisen formally , repeating the ancient formula . He gave the randon his hands . In the days long before Rathillien , when the Highlord had often been not only a Shanir but a blood-binder , his palms would have been cut across for the full blood rite , which would have bound his liegeman to him body and soul until death , and possibly beyond . " Now , be a good chap and do something really useful , like saddling my horse for me . " Within minutes , they were all ready , with two mounts to spare for the cadets who had gone ahead . Torisen pulled himself up onto Storm . " Ready ? Then come on ! " Storm thundered up the ramp . As he burst into the main hall , Torisen saw first the main gate , still firmly closed , and then a dozen of Caineron 's guards running toward him . At least half of them were cadets.  |p103Torisen  reined in abruptly , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight these children , he thought in dismay . . . but can they fight me ? He spurred Storm , giving the rathorn war-cry as the stallion sprang forward . The scream echoed deafeningly off the stone walls . Cadets and veteran retainers alike faltered . Their primary allegiance was to Caineron , but through him they were also bound to his overlord , Torisen . The war-cry reminded them . Their hesitation only lasted a moment , but in that time the horses had swept past them . Shadows moved by the main gate . The two Knorth cadets darted out of hiding to lift the cross bar and shoulder open the door . The wind whirled wet , dead leaves in around their knees . Then Torisen was past them , plunging out into the night , into the blinding rain.  |p105THE  TRADE ROAD fromPeshtar wound westward down through the mountains , followinga boisterous stream called the Ever-quick . During the caravanseason , this route was well traveled , but now Jame , Marc , and Jorin had it to themselves . Wilderness surrounded them . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which also flanked the Riverland . Some seventy leagues ahead , where the road dipped southward to meet the Silver , lay the Oseen Hills . To the south , across the Ever-quick , was the fringe of the Anarchies . On that first day , there was no sign of pursuit , unless one counted the shadow . It swept over the travelers not long after they left Peshtar , and looking up , they saw something large and pale high in the sky , gliding in a southwesterly direction toward the Oseen Hills . " What in Perimal 's name was that ? " Jame asked . " Trinity knows . " Marc watched it vanish into the distance . " A snow eagle , maybe , but the shape did n't seem right . It looked more like some huge albino bat with short wings . Anyway , it 's nothing to do with us  --  I hope . " They went on , forcing the pace as much as their somewhat recalcitrant pack pony would allow . By dusk of the first day , Marc estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped , eight hours ahead of Bortis 's brigands , who would only now be rallying at Peshtar . When it became too dark to travel , the two Kencyr pitched camp under a stand of pine trees beside the stream . While Marc built a small fire , Jame unloaded a pannierp106and found that , again , the Peshtan innkeeper had been more than generous . " As far as I 'm concerned , " said Marc , lying back contentedlywhen they had finished eating , " the honor of Peshtar has been more than restored . " Jame was staring into the darkness across the Ever-quick . The land beyond , invisible as it now was , drew her thoughts as it had off and on all day . " Marc , tell me about the Anarchies . " The Big Kendar gave her a look of mild surprise . " Well now , there 's not much I can say . The hill tribes call them The Place Where No Man Rules , ' which translates rather inaccurately as the Anarchies . I 've never been in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I said before , the old priest at Kithorn claimed that they were the ' thickest ' area in Rathillien  --  that is , the most truly native , with the greatest natural resistance to Perimal Darkling . They 've had a reputation for strangeness as far back as anyone can remember , and only the rathorns move freely there , to mate and to die . " " Once in Tai-tastigon I saw a cuirass made of rathorn ivory . It was beautiful , and worth any two districts in the city . Surely , if rathorns go into the Anarchies to die , men follow them . " " Oh yes . As you say , but those few hunters who do manage to penetrate the Anarchies tend never to come out again . The land itself is said to be treacherous , and then too , most rathorns are man-eaters , given the chance . Also , they 're beasts of madness , ' or so our old priest used to say . I 've heard of seasoned war horses running themselves to death out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Trinity . Imagine riding one into battle . " Marc chuckled . " Oh , the effect would be devastating , I should think , for all concerned . I wonder if that was in Glendar 's mind when he adopted the beast as the Knorth emblem to replace the Master 's dishonored black horse crest . Some say that it was an unlucky choice , since about at that time madness first entered the Knorth bloodline . " " But the present Lord Knorth , this Torisen Black Lord , " said Jame rather sharply . " Surely he 's sane enough . " " Why , yes , as far as I know . At any rate , he should be glad top107get that ring and sword you 've got in your knapsack . They should easily earn you a place in his service , if you want it . " She almost told him then that in Torisen she hoped to find , not a lord , but a brother , but the words would n't come . A silence fell between them . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , and they lay down on opposite sides of it to sleep . Rolled up in her blanket with Jorin snuggled against her , Jame listened to the crackle of burning pine needles and the gregarious voice of the stream . She felt suspended between two worlds . Behind her lay Tai-tastigon , where she had made a life for herself  --  an odd one perhaps by Kencyr standards , but very much her own . Ahead lay the Riverland and a brother whom she no longer knew , but under whose shadow she was about to come . She had never really thought about what Torisen would do with her , or she with him . At any rate , she would see that Marc was rewarded properly . Tori would owe her that much at least . At daybreak they went on . Across the river , beyond a narrowmeadow sprinkled with white flowers , the forest of the Anarchies stood veiled in mist . Rain-colored birds rose , circled above the trees , and plunged silently back into them . The north bank began with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade road the land sloped up to the lower reaches of the Snowthorns in a series of bare hills . This was tribal territory . A dozen clans vied for hunting space here , marking their boundaries with malirs , the skull of their totem animal mounted on a pole with its bones hanging below from a cross piece . Sometimes the headless and not very fresh corpse of a trespasser was lashed to the pole . When the wind blew , the clatter of bones filled every hollow . " I begin to see why westward bound caravans do n't disband at Peshtar , " said Jame , " This is not what I would call hospitable country . " " Just be glad that at this season most of the tribesmen are off hunting deer and each other on the lower slopes of the Snowthorns . Every year the game gets scarcer and the clans more savage . Before long , they 'll be reduced to cannibalism , like the Horde . " " But if the hunting is so bad here , why do n't any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seething with game . " " All the clans consider the south bank to be sacred ground . As I understand it , some three thousand years ago , not long before our kind came to Rathillien , someone or something suddenlybarred them from the Anarchies . Before that , they believed that their dead crossed the river to a new life , and that the soul of the tribe itself had its roots on the far bank . Their shamen still take turns crossing the Ever-quick to perform secretrites on the far side , which they hope will eventually get them back into the Anarchies . They can have them too , for all I care . " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Jame , looking across the river . " The place might be worth a visit , and those rites could be veryIIinteresting indeed . " Marc gave her a worried , sidelong glance . He knew how intrigued Jame was by other people 's religions , but he had never before heard quite that note in her voice , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , he had been uneasy about Jame since Peshtar , where she had so casually slashed that brigand 's throat . Like most Kendar , Marc was not particularly bothered by the Shanir , perhaps because one had to have at least a touch of Highborn blood in order to be one . He had always assumed that Jame was at most a quarter Highborn because not even a half-blood would have been allowed to run as wild all her life as Jame obviously had . He had known about her claws almost from the start , and they too had never disturbed him in themselves . He also knew , however , how reluctant Jame ordinarily was to use them . Had something changed ? He did n't know and did n't like to ask . That second day and the third they made slower time becauseof the pony , which apparently had gone lame . Jame suspectedit of malingering and proved her point by setting Jorin on it . After its initial fright , however , it limped as badly as before and was harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had by no means told Jame all that he knew about the hill tribes ' less endearing customs . The third night , they camped in a stand of poplars on a cliff above the river . In the morning , Jame shook down her long black hair and ran her fingers through it.  | " Filthy , " she said with a grimace , and went down to the river with Jorin trotting beside her . Again , the Kendar said nothing , despite his misgivings . If he had stopped to think about it , he might have wondered why in spite of his seven decades ' seniority he had never felt easy giving Jame orders . Now Marc tried to forget his uneasiness and set about preparing their breakfast . He had just rekindled the fire and was reaching for the food pouch when a foot came down on it . A hillman stood beside him . Marc reached for his axe , but froze as steel pricked his broad back . Two more men had silently come up behind him , armed with hunting spears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping that Jame would hear and take warning . " What do you want ? " Ignoring him , the first man began to rifle through Jame 's knapsack . He pulled out the sword , but threw it aside when he saw that it was broken . Next he found Ganth 's ring , still on the Gray Lord 's withered finger . He threw the finger into the flames and put on the ring . The man had just burrowed down to the Book Bound in Pale Leather when one of his comrades gave a startled exclamation and pointed . Jame stood in the shade of the poplars . Slender and still with sunlight dappling her bare limbs , she looked like some spirit of the grove in human form . There are still such wild things in the wild corners of the earth . Even Marc , seeing her , felt a touch of near primordial dread . The first hillman rose and backed toward the Kendar , his eyes still on Jame . Then , almost experimentally , as if to see how this strange apparition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow on the head with his fist . The Kendar swayed , half stunned . He thought for one numb moment that he had gone blind , but then realized that it was only blood , running down from a forehead cut made by Ganth 's ring . As his vision cleared , he saw the silver sheen in Jame 's eyes and her slow , chilling smile . Jorin cowered away from her . Now she was gliding , almost dancing , through the woods toward them , and the morning light seemed to darken around her . Marc had seen Jame dance as the B'tyrr back in Tai-tastigon , and had been disturbed by it . Now he sensed that this was the true dance of the Dream-Weaver , of which the B'tyrr 's had been only the shadow.  |p110The  hillmen were staring open-mouthed , caught in the dark web of the dance . Jamethiel glided up to the one who had struck Marc . With deft touches , she brought his soul trembling to the edge of his being , ripe for reaping . Then she put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her unsheathed nails slowly , sensuously , along the sides of his neck across the pulsing arteries . They poised for the forward sweep . " No ! " he cried . Jame blinked . What the hell . . . ? She brought her knee up sharply into the hiliman 's groin and again with a crack into his chin as he doubled over . Marc threw himself backward , twisting sideways . One spear point passed under his arm . The other tangled in his jacket . He snapped the first one 's shaft by catching it between his body and arm and turning sharply the other way . The other spearman was trying to free his weapon . Marc grabbed it . He jerked its head forward through his jacket and the man into his fist . By the time he had freed himself from the spear shaft , the other hillman had fled . He and Jame stared at each other over the bodies of the two fallen men . She looked very young , and very frightened . The big Kendar shook his head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading from his eyes . " That man hit me and then . . . and then . . . ah , no matter . " He wiped the blood off his face . " Your throat and my head certainly have taken a beating lately . Here . " He bent and pulled Ganth 's ring off the human 's hand . " I 'm afraid the finger that wore this is gone , but then I always did think it should be given to the pyre . You 'd better wear this now for safe-keeping . " Jame took the ring . She was suddenly very cold , both from the Ever-quick 's icy waters and from delayed shock . She dressed hastily , with shaking hands . Yes , Marc had really forgotten . One mystery of the B'tyrr 's dance had always been that no one could recall its exact details afterward , not even the dancer  --  not until now . This time Jame did remember . Sweet Trinity , she had nearly taken both that man 's life and his soul . And before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife 's imp and to dance at the Peshtar inn ; had her encounter with Keral triggeredall this , or had she always been so reckless ? The Arrin-kenp111had spoken of honor and balance . How far could one go in either direction without falling ? Where did innocence end ? Girl , you do n't want to find out , she told herself . Be very , very careful , because it would be so easy to let go . Jame put on her father 's ring . Even on her thumb it was too big , but her glove kept it in place . Its cold touch steadied her . She held this and the sword in trust for her brother , and they must go to him . That was her primary responsibility now . She picked up Kin-Slayer and nearly dropped it again . An odd tingle had shot through her hand . There were many strange stories about this sword , including a tradition that it enhanced the strength of its rightful wielder ; but Jame had handled it before without noticing anything unusual . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sensation faded . Jame shrugged and returned the sword shard to her knapsack . Marc had bound both captives with their own belts and was now questioning the one whom Jame had stunned . " We have a problem , " he said quietly to Jame in Kens . " This is a Grindark , all the way up from the Oseen Hills . He says he and his brothers were hunting nearby  --  poaching , really  --  when a man swooped down on them out of the sky . " " A man ? " " Well , for lack of a better name . He was naked and seemed to be gliding on skin stretched between his limbs and torso , rather like that white thing we saw yesterday . Also , he had the image of an imu burned into his face . " " Trinity ! That must have been the changer from Peshtar . " " That 's likely , especially since he said he was an emissary from the Black Band . It seems that Bortis has a pact with Grisharki , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigands . The upshot is that these hunters were sent on ahead to waylay us while the changer went to summon more Grindarks from Wyrden , Grisharki 's stronghold . They must be well on their way by now . " " So we 've got Grindarks coming at us from one direction and brigands from the other . Lovely . Now what ? " " We could angle northwestward and try to outflank the Grindark . . . but no . We would only run into more hunting parties . So it looks as if you 'll get your wish , lass : the Anarchies it is. "  |p112FOUR  LARGE STEPPING STONES led across the Ever-quick , each one carved with an imu face . On the far bank were two malirs . Surmounting each was the skull mask of a rathorn , a stallion on the right with both the nasal tusk and the ivory horn curving back from between wide-set eye sockets , a mare on the left with only the nasal tusk . The bones hanging beneath each chimed together in the wind . A road paved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow , toward the trees . " That 's the hill tribes ' spell-path , " said Marc . " Their shamen wo n't enter the Anarchies by any other route and no ordinary hillman is likely to at all . So here we give the slip to the Grindarks and perhaps to any brigand with hill-blood . " " But not to Bortis ? " " I doubt it . He is n't likely to honor the taboo , but with luck we can still evade him without going too far into the Anarchies . Ready ? " Jame settled her pack more comfortably . In it , besides the sword and Book , was a portion of their food and spare clothing . The pony stood nearby , looking bewildered to find itself both unloaded and free . " Ready , " she said . " You first , lass , and mind your step . " Jame backed up a few paces , then took a running leap at the first stone some six feet from the shore . The water rushing past it was both very swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss . She bounded from one to the next across the stream , seeing the green faces flash past under her feet . On the far side , she turned so that Jorin could use her eyes to cross . Marc followed the ounce . They went up the spell-path of white cobbles through the meadow . Ahead , the road ended untidily under the shadow of the trees . Some of the cobbles there seemed to be covered with moss of different colors , which birds were carrying strand by strand up into the trees . No , not moss . Suddenly Jame knew what the shamen 's rites were , and what use the hillmen found for the heads of their enemies . From behind came the sound of voices . Drifting mist momentarilyobscured the meadow , and under its cover , the two Kencyr gained the trees . Looking back , they saw snatches of thep113far bank , then the entire length of the river with some thirty men on the other side . One of them was all too familiar . " Damn , " said Jame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been one step behind us all the way . But how ? " " Maybe he did n't go back into the Ebonbane to rally his men after all . Maybe he just came after us with as many as he could find of the ones who had been on leave in Peshtar . " " He 's got one of the Grindark spearmen . Now what .. . Trinity ! " A shriek cut across the Ever-quick 's loud gurgle . The hillmanwas cowering at Bortis 's feet , one of his forebraids , roughly severed , dangling from the brigand chief 's hand . " Come on , " said Marc . " We 'll have to go farther in than I expected . " He turned and set off with a long stride toward the deeper woods . Jame and Jorin trotted beside him . " But why ? What 's happened ? " " I underestimated Bortis 's cunning and cruelty . The Grindarks believe that the roots of their manhood lie in those braids . That hillman will lead Bortis anywhere rather than lose both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as keen as a wolf 's . " They went southward through the trees , through a patch of a weed called " deadman 's breath , " whose stench should stun the tracker 's nose temporarily at least . Beyond was a brook running down to the Ever-quick . This they followed for some distance , wading upstream in the shallows , before turning southward again . Winter apparently came late in this corner of the world . Few leaves had as yet even changed , and the air was almost warm . A deep silence lay over the land . Dense as these trees had seemed from the other side of the stream , Jame now saw that the real forest still lay ahead , on the other side of a large clearing . They passed under the shade of a solitary red maple , nearing the line of darker trees . Mist blew across the meadow , and abruptly they were back beside the maple . Jame stopped short , gaping . " What in Perimal 's name ? Marc , am I losing my few remaining wits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So we did . How very odd . " The Kendar walked on over the ground they had already covered once . Jame and Jorin followed . " Now , how far had we .. " He vanished.  |p114.  got ? " said his voice behind Jame . She spun about and saw him loping toward her , away from the maple . " Just about to here , " he said , stopping beside her , pointing to the ground a few feet ahead . " This , I would guess , is how the Anarchies were closed to the hill folk . " " And to us ? " " Maybe , maybe not . After all , a few hunters have gotten in , although they keep the way a secret . " He stroked his beard thoughtfully . " Have you ever heard of step-back and - forward stones ? " " Of course , " said Jame impatiently , her mind on brigands and weed patches . " Certain rocks are supposed to be so closely linked to where they developed geologically that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and new sites  --  that is , if you know how to set them properly . Songs say that the Builders played all sorts of tricks with them . Ah , " she said as Marc dropped to a knee and began to cut out a square of sod . " I see what you mean . If some of those special rocks are buried here under the grass ... " " Then stepping on them automatically transports us to their original location , back under that maple . " He lifted out the sod . At the bottom of the hole were stones , smoothly fitted together , carved with intricate figures . " Those are Builders ' runes , " said Jame , peering down at them . " A ring of step-back stones ? That would certainly close the Anarchies , but why should the Builders want to do that , assuming this really is their work ? " " I have no idea . No one knows much for sure about those folk . We 'd be safer if we could cross this barrier , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One possibility does occur . " 1111 Jame let her pack drop . She backed up several yards , thenran toward the exposed stones . Just short of them , she leaped head first over the barrier , rolled  --  and came up back under the maple . Damn . Marc was just turning . She sprinted toward him through the clinging grass . Her foot came down in his cupped hands and they launched her with all Marc 's tremendous strength added to her own . She left his hands as a stone does a sling . The ground passed in a blur twelve feet beneath  --  no , less :  |p115in  fact , here it came . She rolled over and over , finally coming to a breathless stop  --  almost under the dark trees . " Are you all right ? " Marc called after her . " Fine , fine , " said Jame , gingerly picking herself up . " Just send my stomach along by the next post rider . Now , where 's the edge of this thing ... ah . " Her probing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Here . " Marc picked up Jorin , and hurled the surprised ounce across the hidden stones . Then he threw Jame 's pack after her . " Now you . " The big Kendar shook his head regretfully . " There 's no way I can jump that far . You go on , lass . I 'll cover your retreat . " Jame stared at him , appalled , as he unslung his war-axe and turned to wait for the Black Band . She had never stopped to consider how he would cross . It was unthinkable to leave him and yet . . . and yet ... no . There had to be another way across those damned stones . Stones . Jame turned and began to hunt feverishly through the grass for some of the rocks she had just rolled over . Finding one , she pried it out of the ground . Marc looked back , puzzled , as the stone thudded to earth some eight feet behind him . Jame had already pried another , even bigger rock and was staggering back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my attention ? No games now , lass . Run while you can . " " Do n't be . . . " she heaved the second stone , only managinga few feet 's distance with it " . . . stupid . Look , the earth that 's accumulated over the step-back stones obviously does n't hinder them much , but then it belongs where it is . But the two stones I 've just thrown are displaced . They come from ahead . I have n't the skill or knowledge to build a step-forward ' with them , assuming they 're even the right kind of rocks , but just maybe they can counteract the old rune-ring enough to act as stepping stones . " Marc looked dubiously at the two rocks , now almost invisiblein the grass , and again shook his head . " It 's too chancy . " He stiffened . " Here they come . Go now , quickly . "  | " Listen , you idiot , " Jame hissed at him . " Either you come over here , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it ! " Marc gave her a quick look , then shrugged . He went back a pace , then leaped for the first stone , the second , the far side . Jame caught his arm . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he said . " It worked . Look out ! " He knocked Jame backward , away from the first wave of bandits . They rushed onto the hidden stones , shouting , and suddenlyfound themselves back level with the maple . The slower brigands turned , thinking they were under attack from behind . As a lively  --  if confused  --  free-for-all began , the fugitives took cover in the trees . A shadow swept over the clearing . " Damn , " said Jame . " It 's the changer . If he saw how we crossed , he 'll tell the others . Now what ? " " We go farther in . " Jame looked back into the shadow of the trees . A vast silencewaited there , and a lurking presence of leaf and blade , bough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she have ? " Yes , we go on . We have to . " They slipped back into the trees , and the shadows swallowedthem . BOUGHS ARCHED AGAINST THE SKY like the ribs of some great cathedral roofed with leaves . Green light filtered down from above . Gray birds glided between the trees , the underside of each wing marked by a single , almost human eye picked out in subtly shaded feathers . Below , mist drifted around ferns , between the silver-gray trunks . Everything was hazy and dreamlike , a quality enhanced by the great silence of the place . What sounds there were carried with unnerving clarity and seemed to come from all directions at once . Jame and Marc moved as quietly as they could , listening for their pursuers . They heard nothing , but that might only mean that Bortis had had the sense to keep his men quiet once past the step-back stones . Meanwhile , the roof of leaves and mist hid them from the changer , if he was still looking for them . Maybe they really had shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut back across the rune-ring as soon as possible and continue down thep117Ever-quick on its deserted south bank . He did n't tell Jame that he was no longer sure exactly where the stream lay . Jame was equally confused . Not only had she no idea in which direction they were going , but also her senses felt oddly muted . These woods reminded her of the Earth Wife 's lodge in Peshtar , except that here one sank into the strangeness of the place as if into deep leaf mold . She had felt a faint murmur of this among the decaying temples of Tai-tastigon 's elder gods . There was something so strange about them and this place , something so . . . alien . But then she and Marc were the aliens here , as the Earth Wife had said . This was n't even their world . What if there was a native force on Rathillien that had nothing to do with their god ? What would that do to the Kencyrath 's monotheism , to its entire self-conception ? Damn . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had stumbled into the Temple District . Well , this time she would n't panic , at least not before she had good cause . But sweet Trinity , she thought , looking uneasily around , how strange it all was . There ! A flicker , seen out of the corner of her eye , gone when she spun around to face it . " What is it ? " Marc asked . " I . . . do n't know . Something short and gray . It was watching us . Jorin ? " The ounce stirred uneasily . He had clearly caught her visual flash , but had no sensory impressions of his own to add . Whoever ... whatever the watcher had been , it had left neither scent nor sound . Suddenly the cat 's ears pricked . A hoarse , coughing cry welled up around them , as if out of the very earth . Leaves shivered on nearby trees . " What . . . ? " " Hush . " Marc pivoted , but mist and undergrowth cut visibilityto a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . " That was a hunting cry . There are rathorn about . " " Wonderful . Why do we always get a choice of disasters ? " " Virtue has to have some reward , I suppose . " Jame snorted . " Just once , I wish it would pick on someone else . . . hey ! " At that moment , her foot had suddenly broken through thep118leaf mold into the tangled roots of a dead sapling . They closed on her ankle . She tried to pull it free , without success . " What in Perimal 's name --  -- Marc , these roots  --  they do n't want to let me go ! " The tree groaned and began to topple , straight toward her . Marc pushed it aside . It hit the ground with a crash that echoed on all sides , bounding off one tree after another , until it at last faded away into the distance . The roots twisted as the tree fell , clamping even tighter on Jame 's foot . She gave a hiss of pain . " Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marc stripped away mold and earth , exposing the fibrous network beneath . He thrust his big hands down into it . " The shamen never even bring edged tools here , much less weapons . We must n't use them either , if we can help it . " He gripped the roots on either side of Jame 's ankle . The muscles on his arms bulged , wood creaked , and the foot suddenly came free . Jame rubbed her sore ankle gingerly . Ancestors be praised for a stout boot . But had that been a freak accident or a deliberate attack ? Just how strange was this place ? Then both her head and Marc 's snapped up . Somewhere in the woods , somebody had uttered a loud yelp of surprise and pain . A babble of voices followed , quickly hushed . " Maybe someone else put his foot in it , " suggested Marc in an undertone , without much humor . Clearly , the Black Band had crossed over the step-back stones . The hunt was on again . Marc gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly and quietly as they could . The day stretched on and on in green twilight . They heard little of their pursuers and less of any wildlife except for the gray birds , which continued to swoop low over them , coming much closer than wild birds normally do . They were probably only curious , Jame thought . Humans must be a rarity here . One landed on a nearby branch and flexed its wings so that the feathered eyes seemed to blink at the intruders . Jame noted that these were the only eyes the bird had . Somewhere in the distance , a rathorn coughed and then was silent . They still could n't tell if it was hunting them , the brigands , or neither . Most of the time , Jorin trotted at Jame 's side , ears pricked , sniffing , but only a few of his impressions reached her now . Either her still tentative link with him had begun to fade again ,  |p119or  this place was starting to come between them . Then he chose a tree and began happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves fall on him at once . The cat erupted from the leaf mound with an affronted squawk and raced back to Jame 's side where he plumped himself down and began to wash as if nothing had happened . " Now what ? " said Jame , eyeing the suddenly denuded tree warily . Marc chuckled . " Oh , that 's only a dorith . They 're fairly common down the length of the Silver . " He stepped up to another tree covered with what looked like a myriad of small cocoons . " Here 's something rarer , though . It 's called a host . ' Watch . " He rapped its trunk lightly . All the cocoons burst open . A flurry of pale green new leaves leaped into the air and vanished , golden veins flashing , into the upper mist . , " But when will they fall ? " asked Jame , staring after them . " Not until they reach their winter host tree far to the south . They 'll come back in the spring . . It was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , taking on the hint of ghostly shapes , dissolving again as a breath of wind rustled the leaves above . Below , the ferns whispered together . " We 'll have to stop soon , " said Marc . " This is no place for anything human after dark . We 'd better not risk a fire , though . For one thing , Bortis 's men might see it ; for another , I have a feeling that we should do as little damage as possible here . " Jame caught his arm . " Look . " Ahead , a light glowed between the trees . They approached warily , thinking they might have circled around on the brigands ' camp by accident . Instead , in the middle of a glade they found a fragmentary ring of standing stones . Actually , only one still stood . The others tilted drunkenly or lay in the long grass , and most had left behind nothing but empty , overgrown sockets in the earth . All the stones that remained were composed of some cloudy crystalline substance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Marc . " I 've seen small chunks of it before , but never a complete lithon . We could make our fortunep120with one of these , lass  --  if we could get it out of here . This stuff is almost as hard as diamond and it retains sunlight . " His voice set off a faint echo in the glade that seemed to come from the stones themselves . Jame put her gloved hand tentatively on one . It was vibrating slightly . Regarded more closely , its internal cloudiness seemed to suggest some definite but rudimentary shape that she could n't quite make out . Her fingers brushed against gouges scarring the stone 's side . " I thought you said no one brought edged tools into the Anarchies . " " Let 's see . Ah . Rathorns did that . They must spend about a quarter of their lives hacking at stones like these or at anything hard they can find . Apparently a rathorn 's ivory goes on growingthroughout its life . It ca n't do much about the chest and belly plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly honed down , it eventually curves around so far that it comes through the back of the rathorn 's skull . Some scrollsmen even claim that the beast would be immortal if its own armor did n't eventually kill it . " " Marc , let 's stay here for the night . " " Well now , there 's a fresh spoor in the grass . We may have unwelcome company before dawn . " " At least we can see them coming . " The big Kendar glanced at the shadows gathering around them . Very soon , it would be very dark out there indeed . " I take your point . " They ate a frugal supper , then lay down beside the standing stone . Jorin stretched out between them , yawned , and almost immediately fell asleep . So did Marc , although he had intended to keep the first watch . Jame lay awake watching darkness gather beyond the diamantine'sglow . It seemed to her that the woods were full of shadowy forms , drifting , standing , watching . She could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . They wanted to tell her something , to warn her , but the gentle snores of her comrades drowned them out . Now the stones around her began to echo the sound until she seemed to be surrounded by sleepers , human , feline , and lithic . The somnolent hum pulled at her , drew her bit by bit down into sleep.  |p121GOTHREGOR  was nearly as far from Tentir as the randon college was from Tagmeth . Of those seventy-odd miles , the first twenty-five were by far the worst , with the trailing edge of the storm pouring down rain occasionally mixed with hail and the River Road nearly washed out . The nine riders were soaked and all of their mounts spent except Torisen 's black and Burr 's gray when some three hours later they reached Wilden and Shadow Rock Keeps , facing each other across the Silver . Lords Randir and Danior had both alreadyleft with their troops , stripping both keeps ' stables but luckily not their riverside posting station . By now , it was about midmorning . The thunderheads rolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autumn day . Wet leaves lay in drifts of crimson and gold across the road . On bare branches above , raindrops hung like sparkling buds . Harn twisted to look back up the road . " Odd . I thought Caineron would be snapping at our heels by now . We did n't exactly slip out of Tentir unnoticed . " " No well-bred Highborn rides in all weathers like a leathershirttrooper if he can help it . " Torisen quoted . " Now that I 've slipped out of his grasp , I suppose Caineron will wait for his troops and descend on Gothregor sometime tomorrow with all their weight behind him . " " Besiege it , d' you mean ? " " Trinity , no , not with all the other lords there , too . The man 's not that big an idiot . He will simply want to impress thep122rest of the Council . A Knorth defeat there will serve him much better than a quiet assassination here on the road . He must be very sure of himself . Knowing Caldane , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a raving maniac , tied to Storm hand and foot . " " That could still be arranged . You must have gotten that crawler before it could really get you ; but just the same , let me know if you decide to fall off . " " I 'm resisting the temptation . " Harn looked at him askance , clearly unsure how serious he was . Torisen grinned . " Now , Harn . I 've kept you guessing for the better part of fifteen years . Is this any time to stop ? " The burly randon only growled . They took the next two stages at an easier pace , changing mounts again at Falkirr , and came within sight of Gothregor in the late afternoon . The fortress was set on the plateau of a mountain spur that jutted out into the Riverland some one hundredand fifty feet above the valley floor . The outer ward and the fields beyond seethed with troops . As the riders approached , they saw the wolf standard of Hollens , Lord Danior , flying from the branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern barbican . Danior 's people , some one thousand of them , were camped under the trees among the windfalls . Torisen reined in . " Lord Danior . . . Cousin Holly ! " A young man in hunting leathers seated by a campfire turned his head sharply . He rose and came toward them , smiling . " Torisen ! You made good time . We were n't expecting you until tomorrow . " " I had some help . Announce me , will you ? " " With pleasure ! " He went off shouting for his horse . " Is this really necessary ? " demanded Harn . " After last night ? Yes . " Holly came back riding a skittish bay mare . He galloped up to the barbican and gave a loud blast on his hunting horn . The mare nearly threw him . " A Knorth entering ! " he shouted up at the guard . " The gate 's already open , you fool ! " shouted back thep123Kendar , who apparently had neither understood what Holly had said nor recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " bellowed Lord Danior . " Sweet Trinity , " said Torisen in an undertone . " D' you think it 's too late to sneak in quietly after all ? " Just then , the guard saw him . " M-my lord ! Gothregor ! " he turned and shouted across the inner ward . " Gothregor ! " Danior rode through the outwork with Torisen behind him . The others ranged themselves in the Highlord 's wake . The broad inner ward seemed to sway up and toward them as the Kendar came to their feet . There was the leaping flame standardof Brandan and the stooping hawk of Edirr , Jaran 's stricken tree , and the Coman 's double-edged sword flying over a token force : the rest would be waiting down river at Kraggen Keep , as would be Ardeth 's at Omiroth and the Edirr twins ' at Kestrie . Even so , counting Torisen 's people , there were nearly ten thousandKencyr here . " Knorth ! " one shouted , and the rest took up the chant : " K-north ! K-north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to impress whom ? " muttered Harn under cover of the roar . " Trying , sir ? " said Burr . The randon nodded to the west , across the river . " There 's one lot who are n't buying . " Over the ruins of Chantrie , Gothregor 's sister keep , flew the standard of Kenan , Lord Randir : a gauntleted fist grasping the sun . Kenan had brought nearly eight thousand five hundred troops to the gathering of the Host , and of those , watching from the overgrown wards and crumbling battlements , not one raised a cheer for the Highlord 's homecoming . Torisen rode through the roaring crowd to the causeway that led up to the gatehouse . The section passing through the middle ward was so steep that steps had been cut out of the underlying rock . Ahead , the rounded twin fronts of the gatehouseloomed dizzyingly up against the sky . Torisen 's own Kendar leaned over the battlements , shouting . Inside was the inner ward , broad , green , surrounded by barracks , armories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built into the outer wall 's thickness.  |p124Torisen  swung down , wincing . The leg that the wyrm had bitten had stiffened during the long ride . He hung onto Storm for a moment , feeling lightheaded , cursing softly , then let go as Rowan , his steward , limped across the grass to meet him . She too had been at Urakarn and bore the name-rune of the Karnid god burned into her forehead . " My lord ! We were n't expecting you so soon . " " So I gather . Is everything ready for the Council tomor-row ? " " Yes , lord . Everyone is here except Lord Caineron . " Torisen reclaimed his saddlebag , and grooms led the horses away . Gothregor 's subterranean stables were four times the size of Tentir 's , but , until winter , the garrison 's mounts were stabled in converted ground-level barracks . The Kendar certainly did n't need them all . Torisen and his two thousand retainers rattled around in this huge fortress like dried peas in a helmet even when all of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off serving with the Southern Host and elsewhere , a duty that they all took by rotation to earn Gothregor the money it needed to keep going . He could easily have fielded four times as many yondri-gon and filled Chantrie with men and women willing to rebuild it with their bare hands for half a promise of eventual acceptance among his regular troops . Caineron and his sons had built up their own huge army that way . Ardeth kept urging him to accept yondri ; but how could he make promises he might not be able to keep ? Even at two thousand , he felt the strain . It was as if every time he bound a Kendar to him , he gave that man or woman a piece of himself . There was simply no more to spare . " Lord Jaran has been asking for you , my lord , " said Rowan as they approached the keep . " Or rather he keeps asking for Ganth Gray Lord . " " He 's gone soft ? " " As a rotten peach . " Damnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overripefor years , but he had picked an awkward time to go offaltogether , as he must well know . If he could n't hold himself together through tomorrow to support the Highlord , his greatgreat-grandsonwould take over , and the boy was half a Randir . " Poor old Jaran . Make him comfortable , but see that he'sp125kept as far from Lord Ardeth as possible . Adric thinks that senilityis contagious . " Rowan gave him a startled look . " Is n't it ? " " Who knows ? Just be grateful that a full-blooded Kendar like you never catches it . " " Yes , lord  --  and by the way , have I begun to lurch more than usual or are you limping , too ? " " The latter . You would n't believe how big the vermin are at Tentir this fall . But speaking of Lord Ardeth , where is he ? " " In your quarters , lord , making himself at home as usual . He asked that you attend him as soon as you arrive  --  his words , you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indeed . Then I had better go see him at once , had n't I ? " Rowan and Burr exchanged glances . " My lord , wo n't you have some supper first ? " " Burr can bring it up to my quarters . " He had already set off with a fast if uneven stride toward the keep , still carrying the saddlebag . " Me and my big mouth , " said Rowan ruefully . The keep had the same general outline as the larger fortress  --  rectangular with a drum tower at each corner . Its first floor was windowless and dark . Here the lord of Knorth dispensed domestic justice under flaring torches and the stern death bannersof his family . The second floor  --  brighter , more richly appointed  --  alsowas a hall of judgment , but for disputes between other houses . The third floor , as usual , took Torisen 's breath away as he stepped out of the spiral stair in the corner . All four walls between their stone arches were stained glass . Here the High Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing with light , three by three by three . On the fourth wall facing east was a map of Rathillien in colored glass , all Kendar work , of course : the Highborn were about as artistically inept as an intelligent race could be . Torisen stood gazing at the map for several moments as he got his breath back . Then he turned . On the western wall , catchingthe last of the day 's light , was his own rathorn crest , flanked by Ardeth 's full moon and Jaran 's stricken tree . They were the two oldest supporters of his house , in more ways than one . If he was about to lose Jaran , it would be suicidal to quarrel with Ardeth , whatever the provocation.  |p126He  entered the stair and climbed more slowly , favoring his leg , to the room at the top of the northwest drum tower , which served as his study . Adric , Lord Ardeth , sat by the fire in the room 's only comfortable chair , reading a book . He looked up with a smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you again . " " And you , my lord . " It was a pleasure , despite everything , made all the more piquant by the old undercurrent of resentment . Then he saw that the book in the old lord 's hand was his journal . Ardeth noted his change of expression . " Memory is safer , " he said placidly . " I never could understand the compulsion to write everything down . " Torisen put the saddlebag on the table and lifted the book out of Ardeth 's hands . " Hardly everything . " " Oh come . Surely after all these years we two have no secrets from each other . " None , at least , that you have n't tried to sniff out , you old ferret , thought Torisen . " You should n't begrudge me some poor scraps of privacy , " he said lightly . " My dear boy , when have I ever begrudged you anything ? " Torisen was startled into a laugh . " I 've just realized where Caineron gets those . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in answer to Ardeth 's look of inquiry . " He 's trying to imitate you . " An expression of extreme distaste crossed the old lord 's face . " Oh really ! Caineron .... " He became thoughtful . " That man is apt to cause trouble . " " You agree , then , that the Host must march ? " " Of course . You forget that I also served with the Southern Host , back when Krothen 's great-grandfather paid its hire , and that my son Pereden commands it now . We have seen the Horde . A pity that Caineron has n't , and that you gave him that idiotic promise . I said at the time that it was a mistake . " " Perhaps . But if I had n't , Harn Grip-Hard would n't be here now to act as my second-in-command . " " You reinstated him ? But the man is a berserker , unreliable on his own in a battle . " " I rely on him . "  | " Well , you know best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nothing else does . He sold his consent for a promise once , though ; perhaps , for the right price , he will again . " The young man snorted . " And what can I offer him this time , short of the Highlord 's seat itself ? " " A grandchild ? " Torisen made an impatient gesture . " We 've been through all this before . On your advice , I took Caineron 's daughter as a limited term consort , and that did keep her father off my back for nearly a year . Kallystine was sure I would extend the contract to include children . She still is . But if Caineron ever gets his hands on a legitimate Knorth grandchild , I may as well cut my own throat to save him the trouble . Trinity knows , after a night with Kallystine I 've often considered doing it on general princi-ples . " " And yet I 'm told that she is very beautiful . " " So is a gilded sand viper . " " Yes , well , just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Caineron . He has children and grandchildrenwith mothers from nearly every house in the Kencyrath . " Torisen gave a snort of laughter . " Do n't I know it . That man is prolific enough to sire offspring on a mule . " " I daresay . Caldane 's fancy has been known to wander . I could tell you tales of his exploits in Karkinaroth some twenty years ago . . . but never mind . The point is that the bloodlines of his legitimate children form a net of power , one that Caldane may eventually use to entangle and destroy you . Now , if you were to contract to one of my great-granddaughters and I had the right to avenge you if necessary , that might make him hesi-tate . " " Perhaps , " said Torisen dryly , " but it will hardly make him let the Host march the day after tomorrow . " " True , " said Ardeth . He steepled his long , elegant fingers and gazed thoughtfully at them . Firelight woke a spark in the depths of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still keen after nearly fifteen decades . " I will have to pull a few bloodlines myself . Now , if Caineron should cast the sole dissenting vote , he might be pres/cured into changing it . He cares what others think of him , or at least will until what they think no longer matters . Randir will be the most difficult . Between them , he and Caineron command more than a third of the Riverland Host . Danior and Jaran are yours as , of course , am I. The Edirr twins will be swayed by their whimsy , and Brandan by his sense of responsibility . As for the Coman , there should be no problem once you 've confirmed Demoth as lord . " " I have n't decided about that yet , " said Torisen . Ardeth stared at him . " Of course you will confirm Demoth . His mother was one of my great-granddaughters . " " And for that I should give the Coman a lord who is quite possibly an idiot ? " " An idiot , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In case you 'd forgotten , the alternative is Korey , whose mother is a Caineron . That would be quite unacceptable . But enough of this useless debate , " he said , rising . " The matter is settled . Tomorrow at the Council session you will declare for Demoth . " " No , " said Torisen . It was the first time since becoming Highlord that his instinctshad led him flatly to refuse one of Ardeth 's more serious " requests . " He had expected the old resentment to come boilingup . Instead , all he felt was exhaustion and a dull ache in his leg . He leaned against the mantelpiece , looking down into the flames , feeling the bite of Ardeth 's cold eyes . " I 'm Highlord now , Adric , not your field commander , " he said , not looking up . " I have to do what I think is right for the Kencyrath , whatever your wishes , whatever mine . The best I can do is promise to protect your interests whenever I can . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coman , I simply do n't know Demoth and Korey well enough yet to choose between them . " " You young fool . How much time do you think you have ? " A footstep on the spiral stair made both men turn sharply . Burr stepped into the room , carrying a covered tray . " Supper , my lord . " " Oh hell , " said Ardeth , in quite a different voice , and satdown again abruptly , putting his hands over his face . " Adric ? " Torisen bent over him . " Are you all right ? " " What we do n't have time for , " said Ardeth in a muffledp129voice , " is a stupid quarrel . " He let his hands drop . Every one of his one hundred and forty nine years seemed etched deep in his face . " Especially not when the Southern Host has already marched . Do you really think Pereden was ready to take com-mand ? " " I hope so , " said Torisen carefully . " He did have nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all the actual work . Ardeth leaned back in the chair for a moment , his eyes closed . " He is the child of my old age , my last son . All the others died in the White Hills , fighting for your father . Sometimes I wish I had died with them . " He stood up again , more carefully this time . " Think about the Coman . Of course , whichever one you chose , the other is apt to come after you with a knife , but you 'll find in the end that I 'm right  --  as usual . " He glanced at the far wall and blinked , a startled expression flickering across his face . " Adric ? " " Nothing , nothing . " Ardeth shook his white head as if to clear it . " Just eat something and get some sleep . You do n't look as if your northern trip was all that restful . " He paused at the top of the stairs . " Pereden thinks very highly of you , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highly ' my left boot , " muttered Burr as the Highborn disappeared down the steps . " That spoiled brat would spit on your shadow if he dared . " Torisen sighed . " I know . See that Ardeth gets safely back to his quarters , wo n't you ? " " Yes , lord . . . . You did n't tell him what happened at Ten-tir ? " " Trinity ! No , not a word . " Burr grunted . " He 'll hear about it soon enough anyway . " He went down the stair , shutting the door behind him . Now why had n't he said anything about Tentir ? It had n't been a conscious decision at all , more like an instinctive reluctance to tell Ardeth anymore than he had to . Torisen picked up the journal and leafed through it . Names , dates , events . . . Anar , his old tutor , had kept a book like this when he had felt his mind beginning to go . Anar , the keep , Ganth . . . Ardeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure.  |p130That  he had n't was one secret that the lord of Omiroth must never even be allowed to suspect . " Memory is safer , " murmured Torisen , and threw the journalinto the fire . As the pages burst into flames , he turned and saw the child 's shadow on the wall , sitting on the shadow table , swinging her legs back and forth . So that was what had given Ardeth such a start . What was he going to do about her ? What was he doing with her in the first place ? The answer lay just beneath the surface of his mind , but he flinched away from laying it bare . Things were complicated enough already . Just this once , he would do as he pleased and ask himself no questions . He picked up the saddlebag and sat down before the fire holding it . " So what do I do about Caineron ? " he asked the air . No answer . He was too tired to think of anything but grandchildren . Yes , he could promise Caldane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least launch the Host and  --  who knows ?  --  he might die fighting the Horde anyway . If he did n't and Kallystine bore his child , Caineron would certainly move against him in the child 's name . He might still control events but , if not , he could at least prevent a civil war by killing himself . Then Caineron would be Highlord in all but name and soon , probably , even in that . " He cares what others think of him , or at least will until what they think no longer matters . " Torisen remembered Kindrie 's cry of pain . Was that the sort of cruelty the Three People had in store ? Could it possibly be what the Kencyrath 's cold , enigmatic deity wanted for them ? Torisen sat staring into the flames , following the same thoughts around and around , until the distant blare of a horn broke the circle . He woke suddenly beside the dead fire , surprised to find that he had been asleep . Who in Perimal 's name could be blowing a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shutter . From this height , the outer ward seemed starred with campfires , but they were nothing compared to the river of torches flowing down from the north , grouped in battle formation . The horn sound again , imperious . " Restormir ! " came the guard 's hail from the barbican . " Restormir ! " So Caineron had arrived , twelve thousand strong and ap/parently ready for a fight . It must have surprised him to find the outworks open and the walls unmanned . Would he be stupid enough to rush in on the sleeping camp anyway ? Torisen wished he would , since that would turn the other lords against him with a vengeance . Here came torches under the gate : two , six , twelve ; a delegation , then , riding up to Gothregor . Torisen put on his coat . Carrying the saddlebag , he opened the southern door and stepped out of the tower . Beyond was a narrow platform , then a catwalk suspended between the keep 's two front towers . It swayed underfoot as the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatehouse into the inner ward . Three of his established sons were with him , as well as a small , miserable figure who could only be Donkerri . The herald blew another blast , waking a volley of echoes off the stone walls . " Quiet ! " Torisen shouted down at him . " People are trying to sleep ! " Caineron looked up , and flinched . Torisen remembered with sudden amusement that the lord of Restormir was nearly as squeamish about heights as Burr . He unobtrusively shifted his weight to increase the catwalk 's sway . " Highlord ! " Caineron shouted up at him . " My son 's blood is on your hands . I will have justice ! " " So will I ! " Torisen shouted back . " But in the morning . " The walk swayed back and forth , twenty feet down to the flat roof of the keep , seventy to the flagstones before the door . " Your rank will not protect you from the consequences of this foul deed ! " bellowed Caineron , rather desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliverat the top of his voice , much less to a moving target . " If you deny your guilt , I say that you lie and . . . and . . . will you stop that ? " " Stop what ? " Torisen shouted back . The walk swung him up toward the stars and back again with the wind whipping his black hair in his face . " Caldane , go to bed ! Your quarters are ready , and I 've moved the Council meeting up to nine tomorrowmorning . If you 're too excited to sleep , have pity on those of us who are n't . Good night ! " Caineron seemed inclined to argue but , from what Torisenp132could make out at this distance , he was also beginning to look distinctly unwell . He let his sons persuade him to go inside . Torisen waited for the walk 's swing to slow and then went on to the southwest tower , which housed his sleeping quarters . Good . Someone , probably Burr , had started a large blaze in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it . Tomorrowno longer worried him . Caineron had tripped over his own feet before , rushing in for the kill , and somehow , he was about to do it again . Their god might favor a cruel man , but never a fool . He fell asleep almost at once , and dreamed that he was a child again , pushing his sister in a swing back and forth over the edge of a precipice . THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED , high and sweet . Another procession was coming in under the gatehouse . The morning sunlight blazed on crimson velvet and white fur , on steel and ivory . Brandan 's flame banner cracked over his head , its flying shadow throwing the deep lines of his face into even deeper relief . The retinues of the lesser houses  --  Danir , Edirr , Coman , and Jaranwaitingin the inner ward raised their war-cries in welcome , to be answered by Brandan 's troops . Following Brandan would be Randir , Ardeth , and Caineron , in ascending order of importance . " I still say you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torisen 's boots a final buff before handing them to his lord . " You mean sneak out the postern at dawn and come back in by the front door , banging a drum ? No , thank you . Let them come to me . " He pulled on the boots , trying not to wince as the top of the right one came up over his calf . " Still sore , eh ? " Torisen gave the Kendar a dirty look . " Nothing to complain about . " In fact , the wyrm 's bite only looked like a ring of fading bruises this morning . Burr held out his black dress coat with its full sleeves , and he slipped into it . The high collar felt odd without the throwing knives sheathed in it , but even if they had survived the fight with the changer , it would n't have been proper to carry them on such an occasion . A pity that the armorer probably wouldn'tp133be able to replace them before the march south , assuming there was one . There . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you have n't forgotten the Kenthiar , " he said to Burr . Burr snorted . " I hoped that you had . Here it is . " He opened an iron box . Inside lay a narrow silver collar , ornately inscribed with runes of forgotten meaning , set with a gem of shifting hue . It had been found in the unfinished temple at Kothifir when the Kencyrath first came to Rathillien . Some claimed that it was a parting gift from the mysterious Builders ; others , that it had simply been left there by accident . At any rate , in those times of self-doubt just after the Master 's fall , the Kenthiar had become both the emblem and test of authority , for supposedly only the true Highlord could wear it in safety . Many questioned that belief now , but admired the nerve of anyone willing to put the thing on . Burr gingerly lifted it out of its box . Those who carelessly touched the collar 's inner surface were apt to lose their fingers , or worse . After Ganth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair for twenty years , a challenge and a taunt to all would-be successors . Then a drunken Highborn had put it on during a dinner party as a joke . The next minute , his neatly severed head had fallen onto the table and bounced into a soup tureen . No one else had even dared touch the thing until Ganth 's son came to claim it ten years later . Personally , Torisen did n't trust the Kenthiar at all . During its long history , it had also decapitated three Highlords whose claims to power , as far as anyone could tell , had been perfectly legitimate . No wonder so few in recent centuries had been willing to take the risk . If Caineron were to snatch power , he probably could get out of wearing it altogether ; but Torisen , coming to claim his father 's place with neither Ganth 's ring nor sword , had felt that he must make some gesture to prove himself . Now he was about to make it again . " Ready , lord . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , all right . . . go ahead . " Burr put the silver collar around his lord 's neck . The hinges on either side of the gem straightened , and the catch closed with a vicious snap . Torisen caught his breath . Nothing.  | " All serene , " he said to Burr with a smile . " No spilt soup today . . . and just in time . " Up the spiral stair came confused sounds from the Council Chamber below . The lords of the Kencyrath turned and fell silent as the Highlord entered . They were clustered at the far end of the room , under the map of Rathillien now ablaze with morning light . Torisen thought for a moment that they were all avoiding him , but then he caught a whiff of something rotten nearby . The bundle of furs in the chair to the left of his own raised its head . It was Jedrak , Lord Jaran . Green light from the window mottled his bald pate like mold . His nearly toothless mouth stretched in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went forward immediately and took the clawlike hands which the old lord held out to him . Someone on the far side of the room gasped . " No , not Ganth , " he said gently . " Torisen . Remember ? " A look of confusion and near-panic flickered through Jaran 's cloudy eyes . " Torisen ? " His expression sharpened . " Tori ! Yes , of course . Stupid of me . My great-great-grandchild , Kirien . " A soberly dressed young man whom Torisen had n't even noticed stepped forward and gave the Highlord a half bow . His features were unusually delicate and his expression quite unreadable . Torisen returned the bow , then turned to the others . Here it came . " I expect you all know by now that Nusair was killed the night before last at Tentir , and that my lord Caineron thinks I did it . " Caineron snorted loudly . " Thinks ! " " He has probably also suggested to you that I have finally succumbed to the madness that runs in the Knorth blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like senility , was considered not only hereditary but contagious and unsafeeven to mention . " Obviously , this matter will have to be settled before we can discuss anything more important . To save time , we 'll considerthe challenge already issued . As for the answer , no , I did not kill Nusair . That leaves it up to you , my lord Caineron : prove me a liar  --  if you can . "  |p135He  sat down at the head of the table , folded his hands , and waited . For a moment , the assembled lords stared at him . By now , they all probably knew something about what had happened at Tentir ; but none , least of all Caineron , had expected the Highlord to tackle it so directly . Ardeth took his seat at Torisen 's right , casting a look of barely concealed horror across the table at Jaran . Danior also sat down , with an air of defiance ; and Demoth of the Coman , hastily ; and Brandan , because it was only proper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One sat , one stood , cancelling out each other . That left Caineron with the elegant Randir and Korey of the Comen , glowering from a corner . " Well , my lord ? " Torisen prompted . Caineron gave him a sour look . He had really convinced himself that the Highlord had gone over the edge and was afronted to find him so calm , so . . . rational . But then even madness had its cunning , and so did he . He began to pace back and forth , hastily reshaping his argument . " This murder was the culmination of an old quarrel and not altogether unexpected . Lord Knorth never liked my son . " " Who did ? " muttered Danior , and was hushed by Ardeth . " He has even hinted that Nusair tried to assassinate him , once with a snake and once ( Ancestors preserve us ) with a wall . " " So that was what happened at Tiglon , " said Essien , the seated twin , with a solemnity undercut by a flash of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing Essiar , in the same tone . Caineron gave them both a furious glare . Then , forcibly composing himself , he went on to describe the argument at Tentir , and the subsequent finding of Nusair 's naked , mutilated body with the gold coin jammed into his mouth . " That certainly sounds like the work of a madman , " said Brandan thoughtfully , " or of someone feigning madness to implicatethe Highlord  --  your pardon , Torisen  --  but in itself it hardly proves anything one way or the other . " " And so perishes your case , my lord , " said Danior with a laugh . " Not yet , not quite yet . I have one final proof , and rather ap136convincing one at that . You should n't have been so quick to stake your honor , my dear Knorth , for now you are foresworn and dishonored . Not only did you slay my son , but you were seen doing it . Ha ! Now I 've shaken you at last , have n't I ? " " Bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me do something I never did ? " " Seen by whom , Caldane ? " interposed Randir . " If not by you , you can only repeat what you are told , not vouch for the truth of it . You had better bring forward your witness . " Caineron demurred at first , then let himself be persuaded . Watching him , Torisen thought : He and Randir have rehearsed this . Whatever Caineron ' s nasty surprise is , he can hardly wait to spring it . " Very well , " said the lord of Restormir at last , with obviouslyfeigned reluctance . " It would have been kinder to spare the boy , but apparently I ca n't . Donkerri , come here ! " Donkerri slunk out of the shadows , looking utterly miserable . " Knorth , I take it you do n't question my grandson 's truth-fulness ? " " I never have had cause to  --  before . " " Very well , then . Boy , tell them what you saw . " Donkerri gulped . " I-I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I s-saw Torisen , Lord Knorth , kill my father . " Even Ardeth looked shocked . They all had an instinct for the truth , and this boy seemed to be telling it . Torisen leaned forward . " Donkerri , how did I kill him ? " " W-with a knife in the back ... " Caineron looked up , startled . " And then Commandant Harn tore his arm off , a-and then I-I fainted . " " This is very odd , " said Brandan . " Caldane showed me Nusair 's body this morning . I did n't see his back , but the poor lad certainly had both arms . " Torisen fought a terrible desire to burst out laughing . " Caineron , d-do you mean that you set this boy to spy on me and then did n't even listen to his full report ? " Caldane shook his head as if to drive off some buzzing insect . " This is nonsense . The fool is thinking of his cousin . Surelyp137that damned berserker has n't taken up dismembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The voice came from behind Torisen . Kindrie stood in the shadows by the spiral stair , a long slender bundle in his arms . " What are you doing here ? " Cameron barked at him . " I told you to stay at Tentir ! " " The bond between us broke the night before last , " said the young Shanir in a completely colorless voice . " You know that . " He came forward into the jeweled light of the windows , moving as if no part of him wanted to bend . As he leaned forward stiffly to put his burden on the table , both Torisen and Ardeth saw lines of blood suddenly appear on the back of his white shirt . Ardeth unwrapped the bundle . " Is this the limb that you saw torn off ? " he asked Donkerri . " Yes ! " said the boy . A look of great uneasiness flickered across his face . " Yes ... " Essien , ever curious , lifted the arm at the wrist . It dangled bonelessly in his grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My God ! What is this thing ? " " That , my lords of the Council , is the arm of a changer , " said Torisen . " Rather more substantial than the stuff of songs , is n't it , Caldane ? I suspect that this is the hand that killed your son . It certainly is the one that I fought in the fire-timber hall at Tentir where the creature lured me in your son 's likeness and where Harn ripped its arm off . That must have been the battle that your grandson witnessed . I took part in no other . " " I do n't believe  --  " Cameron burst out angrily , but managed to stop himself just short of offering the Highlord a mortal insult . " Damnit , why did n't you tell me any of this before ? " " When did you give any of us a chance ? " Kindrie answered in that same dead voice . " A changer , " said Danior wonderingly . " After all these years . But why ? What was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the living Shanir and the arm of the dead one . " It meant to kill me , " he said , " or , failing that , to entangle me in a blood feud with Caineron as his son 's supposed murderer . " " But again , why ? " said Brandan , picking up the question . " And why now ? "  | " I can only think of one reason : to keep the Host from marching . Laugh if you wish , my lord Caineron , but consider this : For the first time in centuries , the Horde moves north ; simultaneously , a changer tries to kill or discredit the one man who can rally the Host to march south . Now , maybe this really is a coincidence . Maybe something else is brewing that we know nothing about . . . " He thought of the changer spitting at the Master 's name . " . . . but can we take the chance ? Caldane , you asked me at Tentir if I had anything to substantiate my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed at the arm . " And we must n't forget the Southern Host , " said Ardeth , leaning forward with a new ring of urgency in his voice . " It would be madness for King Krothen to order a pitched battle , but he might . We must support our own people , even if  --  Ancestorsforbid  --  that only means gathering their bones for the pyre . " " Then too , " said Randir , examining his nails , " I understand that Prince Odalian of Karkinaroth has asked for help . " Torisen looked at him sharply , surprised . " Not from me he has n't . Caldane ? " " Yes , yes , " said Caineron , giving his sometime ally a nasty look . " A messenger arrived late last night . Odalian asked me as the father of his consort to present his request to the High Council . He says that he 's calling in all his troop levies and asks that the Host meet him at Hurlen just above the Cataracts . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't refuse to help your own son-in-law . " " Oh yes , I can , " said Caineron , looking mulish . " There was no mutual defense clause in the marriage contract . I told him it was n't necessary . " " Names of God , " Torisen said , disgusted . " To get the best bargain by sleight-of-mouth  --  is that all honor means now ? " Caineron drew himself up sharply , his lip curling with scorn . " Another lecture , my young lord ? You always seem to be telling me where my duty lies , you who were n't even born when I took over my house after your father had reduced it to bloody shambles in the White Hills . You can trust me to safeguardmy own honor  --  " " And to pay your servants their back wages . " Caineron started at the sound of Kindrie 's inflectionlessp139voice . " You damned spook ! " he burst out . " Will you get out of here ? " " Perhaps you should leave , Kindrie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caineron seems to find your presence disturbing ... for some reason . " His sharp blue eyes met the Shanir 's faded ones . Kindrie gave a ghost of a nod and began to turn , giving Caineron his first glimpse of the Shanir 's back . " Now , now , let 's not be hasty , " he said with considerable haste . " Stay , man , stay . A broken bond should n't break friendshipas well . " What about a broken skin , wondered Torisen . If the others saw that bloodstained shirt , Caineron would be explaining his honorable system of " back wages " from now until the coming of the Tyr-ridan. 66My lords , " he said , " it seems that you have a choice of three reasons to let the Host march . First , to support the SouthernHost . As my lord Ardeth says , these are our people ; we ca n't simply abandon them . Second , to support Prince Odalian who is , after all , the closest thing to an ally that the Kencyrath has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lunatic of a Highlord , who still believes that the Horde is about to march down our collective throats . Take your choice of reason , but in all the names of God , let 's not waste any more time . Now , do we march or do n't we ? Ardeth ? " " Yes . " " Randir ? " " Yes , regrettably . " " Brandan ? Edirr ? Danior ? " " Yes . " " Yes . " " Yes . " " Coman . . . damn , I forgot . Demoth , the Coman is yours , for the time being at least . I 'll make a final determination later . " " Yes , lord , " said Demoth , sulkily . He had expected full confirmation . " Jaran ? " A rasping snore answered him . " Jedrak ? " The old lord 's great-great-grandson shook him gently , without result . " I 'm sorry , my lord . When he drifts off like this , he may be gone for hours or even days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the young man calmly , ignoring the interruption , " I am authorized to speak for him . " " And ? " " I vote ' yes . ' What else ? " " Well , Caldane , " said Ardeth , " it seems you decide the matterafter all ; your vote against our eight . What do you say ? " Caineron glowered at him . His plans all awry , he looked ready to bid defiance to them all out of sheer ill-humor . At that moment , Burr entered the hall . Caineron turned on him , snarling , but the Kendar 's expression made him hesitate . " Burr , what is it ? " Torisen demanded . " News , my lord . The Southern Host has engaged the vanguardof the Horde . " " Oh my God . With what result ? " " None as yet , when the messenger was sent out . But he says it looked bad , very bad . " " Pereden , " said Ardeth under his breath , almost in a moan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . " The next moment he was on his feet , confronting Caineron as fierce and bright as drawn steel . " You will vote now , my lord , and you will vote ' yes , ' or it will be war indeed , your house against mine . Well ? " " Yes , " said Caineron , going back a step . " Yes , of course . This news changes everything . But sweet Trinity , there are barely fifty thousand of us here ready to march . Even if Odalian sends the troops he has promised , what can we do against an enemy three million strong ? " " There is one place where we can hold them . " Torisen went to the far end of the room where the stained-glass map of Rathillienblazed in green and blue and gold . He traced the southward twisting path of the Silver , from the Riverland to a spot where the craftsman had frosted the glass to indicate billowing clouds of spray . " There . The Cataracts . Odalian has the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must pass here , up the narrow Mendelin Steps to the top of the falls . There we stop it , or not at all . " " So it 's a race to the Cataracts , " said Brandan , regarding the map with a practiced eye . " Roughly two thousand miles for us , and about a fourth that for the Horde , which luckily travels at ap141near crawl . Just the same , this is going to be very close . When do we start ? " " Just as soon as we 've given Nusair to the pyre . The marchingorder to Omiroth will be according to whoever is ready first . We 'll sort things out there . Any questions ? Then let 's get at it . " The lords dispersed , except for Ardeth . Donkerri tried to slip out in his grandfather 's shadow , but Caineron turned on him , all his frustrations spilling over . " You ill-omened brat , get out of my sight ! I never want to see you again ! " " Grandfather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . " I cast you out ! " he roared . " Blood and bone , you are no kin of mine . " He jerked the hem of his coat out of Donkerri 's grasp and stalked away , leaving the boy standing white-faced , staring after him. . . damn you , boy , for deserting me . I curse you and cast you out . Blood and bone , you are no kin of mine .... " Torisen flinched at the memory . If a father 's dying curse held any power , he was as disowned as Donkerri , or as Kindrie , for that matter . But that had only been a dream . This was real . " Burr , take the boy up to my quarters and then fetch a doctor . We 've got a casualty up here . " " Yes , lord . " He dropped his voice . " Lord , there was a secondmessage , this one from Bandon Larch . " " My old five-thousand commander . Yes ? " " She says that King Krothen did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern Host to march out . The whole thing was Pereden 's idea . " . . . squat figures moving among the slain . . . oh , Pereden , you fool , you god-cursed , jealous fool .. . " Ardeth is n't to know , not if we can keep it from him . Understood ? " Burr nodded and left the chamber , taking the stunned boy with him . Ardeth had made Kindrie sit in his chair . The Shanir had his head down on the table and seemed to have fainted , for hedid n't even twitch as the lord cut away his ruined shirt . " I 've sent for a physician , " said Torisen , coming up to them . " That wo n't be necessary . Look . " Ardeth had carefully uncovered the Shanir 's back . Kindriep142was painfully thin , almost emaciated . His ribs showed quite clearly under white , nearly translucent skin , crisscrossed now with the marks of a Karnid corrector 's scourge . But even as the two Highborn watched , the bruises seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken open when Kindrie bent to put down the changer 's arm , suddenly closed , the raw edges knitting together into cicatrices . Torisen turned abruptly away , feeling sick . " Wonderful ! " Ardeth said behind him . " A pity we ca n't all do that , eh ? But then it 's rare , even for a Shanir . You know , my boy , you owe this young man a great deal . How fortunate that he is no longer bound to Caineron . Now you can repay him properlyby taking him into your service . " Bind himself to a Shanir ? He did owe it to Kindrie , and it would be a shameful thing to refuse , but . . . but . . . . He remembered the changer 's arm , still lying on the table behind him . Its fingers had seemed to reach out toward Kindrie , as if to touch his white hair . Another Shanir .. . " I 'm sorry , Adric , " he said without turning . " I-I ca n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ardeth coldly . " Then I will , until you can bring yourself to do your duty . " Torisen left the hall without a word , without looking back . At Tentir , he had said to Harn , " I can do anything I have to , " and that had always been his creed . Now , for the first time , he had failed . NUSAIR 'S PYRE was set in Gothregor 's inner ward , with four priests officiating . Several days before , two other of their numberhad set off for Tai-tastigon to cope with trouble in the templethere , and a seventh had left even more recently with three acolytes for Karkinaroth on a similar mission . No one knew what was wrong at either temple , only that the balance of power in each had shifted , suddenly , dangerously . But that was priests ' business , and no one else paid much attention to it . What they did notice was that at least one of the priests at Gothregor was n't very adept with the pyric rune because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames but also about four hundred chickensbeing prepared for lunch in the fortress 's kitchen . Otherwise , it was a very successful cremation.  |p143By  dint of practically getting behind his troops and pushing , Lord Danior got them into second place behind the rathorn banner . He and his guard rode ahead with Torisen . Ardeth 's full moon followed Danior 's wolf standard , but Adric stayed with his people , Kindrie riding pale and silent beside him . The token forces from Kraggen and Kestrie followed , then Jaran , Randir , Brandan , and finally Caineron . Caldane 's troops had already marched nearly one hundred and twenty-five miles over the past forty-eight hours and had arrived the night before in a state of collapse . Several hours of dwar sleep had nearly repaired the damage , but not quite . That night at Omiroth , everyone slept deep , and in the morning the order of march was confirmed . That day the Edirr and Coman forces joined the column . Early that afternoon , on the tenth of Winter , the Host marched out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossedthe step-back stones into the Anarchies after a brief but confusedbattle that left several men injured and one dead . The half-dozen brigands originally from the hunting clans refused to cross at all . The rest had caught the scent of blood , however , and pressed on , all the more eagerly because of the reward that Bortis had first offered in Peshtar . The blind bandit chief himself led the way with his Grindark tracker . When he thought about what he would do to the fugitives , especially to Jame , he drooled a bit and lashed at the bound , hobbled Grindark to make him go faster . The woods took the brigands by surprise . They were used to the evergreen forests of the Ebonbane , but the expanse and quality of the silence under these green leaves awed them . Bortis did n't have to tell them to move quietly . Only once was the silence broken , when they heard the crash of a tree falling somewhere in the distance . " It 's them ! " exclaimed one man excitedly , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammerlike fist . " Quiet , you half-wit . D' you think they 've taken up lumberingto pass the time ? " They continued , foraging as they went . One man handy with a sling had already brought down a number of gray birds . Now another bandit saw what appeared to be a giant puff-ball mushroom , but when he reached for it , the fungus cap turned itself inside out around his hand . His cry of surprise turned top146one of pain . The others cut it away to reveal a hand covered with small punctures like wasp stings , but ringed with orange-tinged flesh . The fingers had already begun to swell . By dusk , it was fairly clear to everyone but Bortis that they were lost . Their only hope lay in the tracker , who still seemed to have some intermittent idea of where he was going . At nightfall , they built a large fire and roasted the birds on spits . Then they tore down boughs and uprooted ferns from a nearby hillock to make their beds . All slept deep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their dreams ran the steady sound of munching . In the morning , several men could not be awakened , and the four who had lain down against the denuded hillock were simply gone . That reduced the Black Band to fourteen men , including the one who had been attacked by the puff-ball . The others found him already awake , staring with rapt , almost greedy attention at his hand . The fingers now were so swollen that they seemed to merge . The skin was puffy and orange . He backed away from the other brigands , holding his bloated hand against his chest . " You ca n't have it ! I found it . It 's mine , mine ! " He sank his teeth into the spongy mass and tore off a strip . " It 's mine ! " he muttered again , chewing furiously . " Find your own ! " With that , he darted off into the woods with his prize . The others did n't follow . " Up ! " said Bortis harshly to the Grindark , jerking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " protested one man , indicating the half-dozen brigands who slept on as if drugged . " Leave them . They 're no good to me like that . " " Yeah ? " said another brigand . " And what good will that reward of yours be to any of us if we never get out of here to claim it ? I say turn back , and if you wo n't , " he finished , belligerently , glancing at the others , " we will . " " Oh , will you ? " Bortis gave a nasty laugh . " Then go . I ca n't stop you . I ca n't even see you . But you know who can , and what he 'll do to you if you break faith with me . " To a man , the bandits glanced up with apprehension at the canopy of leaves that hid the sky . They had n't seen the changerp147since the previous day , but not one of them doubted that he was up there somewhere or that he would deal with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had challenged Bortis 's orders . The brigand chief waited , a growing sneer on his lips . " What , no more debate ? Then come on , you gallows-bait . Just think how rich you 'll be when we catch that Kencyr brat , and how well entertained . " AFTER A NIGHT OF DARK DREAMS , Jame woke to find the woods swept clean of shadows , aglow with golden light . It must be near dawn . Marc and Jorin slept on , both snoring faintly . The ounce lay stretched out on his back , head cushioned on the Kendar 's arm , paws curled over his chest . When Jame put her hand on the warm cream-colored fur of his stomach , his respiration changed into a sleepy purr , but he did n't wake . She lay back , wondering at her own uneasiness . It seemed to her that in her dreams she had been warned , but by whom and against what ? Here with Marc , she felt quite safe , but then he often had that effect on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that shielded him from evil . Even the Earth Wife had sensed it . But she could n't spend her life in his shadow . Even now , thirst made her slip away from him and rise . Now , where was that brook ? She followed its sound , moving in quite a different direction from the previous night . Then too , it was  --  or seemed  --  farther away . Perhaps she was simply approaching it at a different point . She scrambled down to it through the bushes and knelt on the grassy bank about a foot above the water . As she leaned over to scoop up a handful , the ground suddenly gave way under her . Jame surfaced , sputtering . The water was only chest deep , but shockingly cold , and the current made it hard to stand . Of all the clumsy , fumble-footed accidents . . . . She clutched at the bank . It crumbled away . Downstream a few steps , a bush overhungthe water . Jame let herself be carried down to it and grabbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclamation . Blood from a deep puncture stained the thumb of her glove . She saw then that each branch ended in a blunt , blind head , green barked , with thorns instead of fangs . Every head was turned toward her . Downstream , similar bushes on both banks closed over the water . . . and upstream , too . Surelyp148those had n't been there before , nor the ones surrounding her now . She felt a chill that had nothing to do with the icy waters . They were closing in . Jame backed into midstream , bracing herself against the current . " Marc ! " The name came out in a croak , but loud enough , surely , to wake the Kendar . " Marc ! " No answer . Then she remembered his deep , slow breathing . Somehow , dwar sleep or something very similar had claimed him . He would not hear her now , even if she screamed . The branches were closer now , rustling . They would arch over her , press down . She would tear her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight weight . A gray bird landed on a nearby tree branch and spread its wings . The two feathered eyes regarded her unblinkingly , as if the entire forest were watching . The Anarchies had tried and condemned her , Jame thought wildly . But why ? She had played by the rules , harming nothing . It could only be because she really was a darkling , as the Arrin-ken had said , and the Anarchieshated anything with the darkling taint . Marc could n't help her now . Her own god would n't even if , as she half doubted , his power did extend to this strange place . But did that deprive her all protection ? Slowly she reached underwater and drew the imu medallionout of her pocket . She held it up to the feathered eyes of the gray bird . " I-I have the Earth Wife 's favor . " The wings beat once , eyes blinking , then again and again . The bird soared off between the trees . The bush 's nearest blind head took the medallion from Jame 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mouth , and the branches withdrewin its wake . She scrambled back onto the bank . On the far side , a green head offered the medallion back to her . She took it . There was blood on the imu 's lips again  --  her blood this time from her thorn-stabbed finger . She collapsed on the grass , shakingfirst with cold and then with helpless laughter . Saved by a pun ! She wondered what the Earth Wife had done to her imp when she discovered that the medallion was missing . Finally getting a grip on herself , she rose and went back to the ring of diamantine stones.  |p149Marc  and Jorin still slept . Jame changed into dry clothes , then paused , looking down at them . Perhaps the Kendar had somehow fallen into dwar sleep , but the ounce , too ? Frightened now , she shook them and called their names . They woke , slowly , reluctantly . Marc stretched . " Ah , lass , you should have gotten me up sooner . We had better eat our breakfast on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puzzled way . " That 's odd . I could have sworn that group of trees was over there . Everything seems to be turned around . Hello , what 's that ? " He turned sharply , then shook his head , even more perplexed . " Gone . " " What is ? " " Something gray . I only saw it out of the corner of my eye . A bird , maybe . Now , which way did we come ? " They could n't tell . Nothing seemed to be where it had been the night before , and the mist so defused the morning light that they could n't even be sure in which direction the sun rose . Jorin was confused , too . Jame circled the clearing with him , and as far as the ounce 's keen nose could tell , they had never entered the ring of stones at all . " So much for Bortis 's tracker too , I hope , " she said , then turned abruptly . " There , again , by that larch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When she looked directly at the tree , nothing was there , but at the edge of her field of vision she saw . . . what ? " A figure , wearing a gray hooded cloak , " said Marc . He had caught the trick , too . " Why , it 's no bigger than a child . " " And it 's beckoning to us . I think it wants us to follow . Should we ? " Marc considered this briefly , then nodded . " Maybe it can lead us out of here . It 's worth a try , anyway . " They collected their gear and followed , with no idea if their spectral guide was conducting them out of the Anarchies or farther in . It was n't even easy to keep that gray figure in sight . " I 've lost him again , " said Jame , for the third time in half an hour . " This undergrowth is too dense . " In fact , they had gotten into a real thicket now , flourishing under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edged here and there with the rose and hectic red of autumn , hung with berries bright as drops of blood . A breeze rustled through the dense foliage . Like all sounds in this strangep150place , it seemed to come from every direction at once in a flurry of crosscurrents . Jorin stiffened , his nose twitching . The fur down his back slowly rose . Then Jame caught a sharp , tangy scent that made her own nose itch and startled a host of fragmentary , fleeting images . " What is it ? " Marc asked in a low voice . " I . . . do n't know . Something very close , very wild . . . " She slipped away through the bushes without waiting for an answer , hardly knowing if she fled this unknown thing or sought it . Branches closed about her . The breeze made them dip and sway , surrounding her with shifting planes of green . For a momentJame hesitated , completely disoriented . The wind died . She forged ahead , suddenly emerging on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillock from which most of the greenery had been stripped , stood a rathorn . Jame 's first impression was of a black stallion wearing elaborateivory armor , and then of some fantastic cross between a horse and a dragon . The creature was tall and finely made , with slender legs and a broad chest tapering back to powerful hindquarters . His arched , almost serpentine neck supported a small head encased in an ivory mask , out of which grew the nasal tusk and curved horn of a rathorn stallion . Ivory plates curved around his neck , chest , and abdomen . More ivory sheathed his forelegs like a pair of greaves . His white mane and tail hung against his ebony coat like falls of heavy silk . He stood absolutely motionless , staring at her . She stared back , only dimly aware that the four mares of his rage were behind him with their heads up , also watching her . A man lay in the grass at one of the mare 's feet . His belly had been ripped open . In all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiralling down the mare 's tusk . The rathorn scent hung heavy as incense in the still air , numbing the mind , making the senses hum . It drew Jame forwardone halting step , then another . Under its hypnotic lure , she felt a hunger for young meat , fresh meat , that was not her own . Then , from everywhere and nowhere , came a moaning cry . It rose , faltered , sank into a series of deep sobs . A shriller voice echoed it , note for despairing note . The rathorns ' armored heads turned as one . Between onep151blink and the next , the mares had disappeared in a blur of ivory and ebony . The stallion backed away , ears flat in their mask grooves , then pivoted in one supple , flowing motion and sprang after his rage . " That was close , " said Marc 's voice behind her . Jame drew a deep , shaky breath . The world seemed to redefine itself around her . " Yes . But what on earth would frighten a rathorn like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . Several of them . " She started forward , but he caught her arm . " Wait a minute . " They waited . When the terrible cry was n't repeated , they went cautiously out into the clearing . " Why , these are some of Bortis 's brigands , " said Jame , crouching beside one while Jorin sniffed at him warily . " This man seems to be asleep . " " These , too . " Marc shook one bandit , then another and another , without result . Jame remembered how deep in sleep she had found her friend earlier and shuddered . " There must be something in the air . " " Phew ! " said the Kendar , straightening . " There certainly is . What 's that stink ? " They circled the hillock . On the far side were three skeletonsjumbled together , covered with green slimy mold . The hill made a sound that was half rumble , half gurgle , and excreted a fourth skeleton from a foul-smelling hole hidden under a fringe of its few remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a charming place . D' you suppose our friend in gray brought us here on purpose ? " " A trap , you mean ? It could be and yet , somehow , I do n't think so . Do you ? " " Somehow , no . Trinity ! " The cry had come again , closer , double-noted . It was n't a sound so much to inspire fear , Jame decided , as utter , hopeless misery . The wretchedness of it was almost contagious . For a moment , curiosity tugged at her , but then that terrible moan sounded a third time , almost in her ear , and nearby leaves began to wither on the bough . " I have an idea , " she said to Marc . " Let 's go someplace else . " Since their gray guide was still nowhere in sight , they fol/lowed the path beaten through the thicket by the rathorns . They had just gotten clear of the bushes when the sound of other cries and then of screams reached them , apparently from ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He unslung his waraxeand loped off between the trees toward the source of the commotion . Jame and Jorin ran after him . " Marc , wait ! What if it 's the Black Band ? " It was the Band , but by the time the two Kencyr reached it , none of its members was in a position to do them any harm . The slashed , trampled bodies lay on ground soggy with blood , among white flowers slowly turning pink , then red . The rathorns ' trail led through this carnage and beyond . " So much for that , " said Jame . Marc looked slightly surprised at hearing her dismiss a dozen lives so casually . All he said , though , was , " Not necessarily . Bortis is n't here , and neither is the Grindark . " " Perhaps they did n't make it this far . " " Perhaps . But then there 's still the changer , and our mist cover is beginning to wear thin in patches . " As if on cue , sunlight brightened around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . " That looks like a building , " said Jame . " What on earth is one doing here ? " Marc shook his head . " I ca n't imagine . " They went toward it through the trees , still following the rathorns ' trampled path . More white showed through the leaves , resolving itself into a low , vine-draped wall , which stretched about one hundred yards in either direction . Beyond , rose a jumble of white buildings , the tallest of them barely over fifteen feet high . The rathorns had apparently leaped the wall . Jame , Marc , and Jorin followed until they came to a postern so low and narrow that the Kendar almost got stuck as he squeezed through it . Inside , an equally narrow lane zigzagged back between the buildings . Crosswalks spanned it here and there , connecting second or third stories . Only Jorin could walk under the former without ducking . Overhead , circular windows glazed with crystaland rimmed with decorative motifs faced each other across the way . They soon came to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , it was very narrow . Unlike them , no walkways spanned it , and it was paved with the cross-sections of diamantine lithons quarried , perhaps , from the broken ring where they had spent the previous night . The glowing stones were worn down to a groove as if by the passage of many feet , or hooves . The smell of rathorn clung to the walls . At a guess , the rage had also come this way , still in full flight . The two Kencyr followed warily . They began to pass doorways opening into rooms lit by diamantine blocks set in the walls . The lighted , empty interiors gave Jame the uncanny feeling that at any moment some diminutivehouseholder might lean over his door jamb to invite them in . The sense of arrested life was strong in this place , but so was the feeling that everything had stopped here long , long ago . Marc had also been looking about . " Now , that 's odd , " he said . " See that decorative band up there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody the masks . I 've seen lots of imus in my time , but never before one that was used to make a joke . Who could have built this , any-way ? " " Apparently someone who knew how to make a step-back ring . Why seal off the Anarchies unless to protect this place ? " The Kendar shook his head in wonder . " They had more than their share of nerve , then . Imagine laying a claim here . But what could have happened to them ? " " Look ! " said Jame sharply , catching his arm . In the far corner of a lighted entry hall hung something gray . " Oh , " she said , disappointed . " I thought for a moment thatit was our guide . That does look like his cloak , though . " " Maybe he got home before us , " said Marc , half joking . " I wonder . " She ducked under the low lintel . White stone dust rattled down on her head and shoulders . The interior walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the diamantine blocks . " Careful , " said Marc , bending to peer in after her . " I think it must be safe enough or Jorin would n't have come in here with me . " She crossed over to the gray object . It looked exactly likep154their erstwhile guide 's hooded cape , but when she touched it , it crumbled to dust . Beside the hook where it had hung was a narrow hallway that had been quite invisible from the door . It led back into the house . Jame wrestled briefly with temptation and lost . " Marc , I 'm going to do a fast bit of exploring . " " If you like . I 'll wait out here and spare my old back the stooping . Be quick , though . " Jame stepped into the hall . As in the first room , the ceiling was barely five feet high , forcing her to keep her head well down . The corridor seemed to extend quite a preposterous distance , one hundred yards at least , when the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her first step took her a good fifty feet down the passageway . So , whoever had built this place liked to play with spatial distortions . A few more steps , and here was a doorway opening into a fair-sized room with a ceiling at least twice as high as the corridor 's . The only piece of furniture was a long marble table about two feet high , apparently standing on the left hand wall . Jame stared at it . Could something so massive be bolted to the wall ? The threshold was at a forty-five degree angle , but it felt level as she stepped on it . So did the floor . . . but it was n't the floor , or at least it had n't been a moment ago . Set in the far wall was a large oval window . The right half of it was dark with the trees of the Anarchies , all horizontal . The bright left half was the misty sky . Jame shut her eyes hastily . The sense of vertigo disappeared at once . Yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it felt perfectly natural . " What a place for a party ! " she said out loud . In fact , it looked as if there had been one , Trinity only knew how many years , or centuries , or millennia ago . At one end of the table was a litter of small bottles . One of them still contained some clear liquid , which instantly broke down into crystals when Jame touched the glass . On impulse , she emptied the bottle 's dehydrated contents into an inner pocket lined with waterproof silk . Who knew , someday she might find someone she disliked enough to test the stuff on . She left the room , stepping down to the hall floor , and went on up the passageway . Within a few steps , the corridor turned . Although it still looked perfectly flat , Jame felt a strain in her legp155muscles as she went on and was n't surprised , when she came to a window , to find herself on the second floor . Here there were several rooms that once might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , blowingthrough , had long since reduced everything to dust . At the end of the corridor was one last door , made of ironwood , with three massive locks . It stood ajar . Jame pushed it open cautiously and paused on the threshold , startled . The rest of the house had been bright with sunlight and diamantine reflecting off white walls . This last room seemed to be hewn out of a dark , half-familiar stone shot with luminous green veins . The moss covering the floor also glowed faintly . What little other light there was came from a large oval window set in the far wall . Like those below , it was sealed with rock crystal ; unlike them , heavy bars also crossed it . Beyond was a sullen sky , the color of a bruised plum , and a deep valley overgrown with luminous vegetation . The ruins of a white walled city lay in the valley 's folds . Vines had almost consumed it , but enough remainedto show its resemblance to the miniature city of which this house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anarchies , or even anywhere in Rathillien . This entire room must be made of stepbackstones , stepped all the way back to some fallen world far down the Chain of Creation , deep within the coils of Perimal Darkling . Why cling to such a desolute view ? Why , unless that distant , lost world was somehow precious . Unless , perhaps , it was home . Some pieces of the puzzle began to click together . The Anarchies had been sealed off some three thousand years ago by people who knew how to use step-back stones and who quite possibly were n't native to Rathillien . Neither were the mysteriousand elusive Builders , who at approximately the same time had been erecting the Kencyr temples using a host of architecturaltricks including both step-back and - forward stones . It seemed very likely , then , that this city too was Builders ' work . It might even have been their headquarters on Rathillien , despite its distance from all of their building projects . The seclusion of the Anarchies would certainly have appealed to them , and they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land 's strangeness.  |p156But  if so , what had happened to them ? When their work on Rathillien was complete , had they simply moved on to the next threshold world as they had done so often before ? That was possible , but it hardly explained the odd atmosphere of this city , as if life here had stopped suddenly , unexpectedly . Jame shrugged . The puzzle still lacked too many pieces , and perhaps always would . She turned to go , and stopped short . In the corner , in the door 's shadow , lay a pile of bones . They looked nearly human . The skull was n't quite the right shape , though , and the entire skeleton reassembled would barely have come to her waist . So . Wherever the rest of the city 's diminutive occupants had gone , here was one at least who had n't gotten very far . Jame knelt by the bones , feeling awed . Could this possibly have been a Builder ? In all the long history of her people , no Kencyr had ever even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dark behind those large eye sockets was like the darkness of this room , as if it held the secret of an entire race , obscured now forever . Looking closer , she saw that most of the bones were shot with hairline cracks like those that fissured the walls . She touched the skull tentatively . It fell into fragments . The rest of the skeleton followed , crumbling bone by bone . Jorin sneezed , and bone dust filled the air . Jame sat back on her heels , rueful . She 'd done it again , destroying where she had only meant to investigate . But then among the ruins she spotted one bone that had n't disintegrated . It was a third phalange , the tip of a finger , twice as long as her own . She picked it up gingerly , marveling at its delicate structure . Here was something , at least , saved for the pyre . She carefully wrapped it in a handkerchief and slipped it into her pocket . Now to rejoin Marc , who probably thought she and Jorin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow street , there was no sign of her friend . " Marc ! " Echoes answered her , and wisps of mist drifting around the next corner . The silence rang . Jorin pressed against her knee , uneasy . Other doorways opened off the street , their interiors glowing softly , invitingly , but with no sign of life . " Marc ! "  |p157This  time she thought she heard an answer , toward the heart of the city . She followed it , calling again , hearing the same faint , distorted reply . The mist grew denser with each turn . Jame ran one hand along the nearest wall while keeping the other on Jorin 's head to guide him . Suddenly he slipped away . She called after him with voice and mind , but neither brought a response . Damn their mind-link anyway for being so unreliable . But a moment later there he was again , chirping anxiously , running nose first into her knee . She took a firm grip on his golden ruff . " Hush , kitten . Listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did sound like Marc , but there was something odd about it , something almost mocking . Jame felt Jorin 's fur bristle under her hand . He knew that voice , and suddenly so did she . Bortis . They went on , stalking more than seeking now , but still blind in the swirling mist . The glow of the diamantine pavement faded away underfoot , and then Jame 's hand lost contact with the wall . She groped for it , without success . The city must be built around some kind of open space . A half-dozen more blind steps and her foot struck something a ringing blow . Someone nearby chuckled . " Brave Talisman , pretty eyes , " crooned that hated voice , making no effort now to disguise itself . " How does it feel to be lost and blind ? " The sound seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere . Jame felt her sense of direction slip away . She heard stealthy movements in the mist , growing louder , nearer , seeming to surround her . She crouched , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clearly had no idea which way to turn . Hopefully , neither did Bortis , but if he still had the Grindark tracker and they were approaching from down wind . . . A low , wailing cry cut through the opaque air ; its shrill double note echoing sharply back as though from close-set walls . The nameless thing that had put to flight an entire rage of rathorns was in the city , drawing closer . Someone almost at Jame 's elbow gave a hoarse exclamation . Two pairs of footsteps crashed away , apparently in all directions at once . She and Jorin must flee too , but which way ? A black despair , not her own , gnawed at the edges of her mind . The closer that thing came ,  |p158the  more likely that they would run straight into it . What to do ? The cry came again , closer , paralyzing in its misery . In a moment of near panic , Jame felt again how out of place she was here , how unable even to understand this land 's threats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the imu , whose power was somehow linked to this strange place . She drew the medallionout with unsteady fingers . " Help us , " she whispered to it . Nothing happened . Had it lost its potency or had she forgottensomething ? Yes , damnit : the thing had to be fed . She thrust the edge of her hand against the imu 's mouth . A sharp pain made her gasp and she jerked her hand away . A small crescent had been bitten out of it right through the leather glove . For one startled moment , she watched blood well out of the tiny wound before wondering why she could see it so clearly . The mist swirled as densely as before around them , but not in front of the imu . She turned the medallion 's face outward . A path opened before her as if a beam of light had transfixed the mist andI burned it off , but there was neither light nor heat , only a shaft of clear air lit through the mist by the morning sun riding high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rathorn . She had accidentlykicked one of its ivory belly plates , which still curvedaround emptiness to meet the cage of overlapping ribs . The skull mask was twisted toward her , the impotence of death rendering its frozen fury all the more savage . Its massive hornhad curved all the way around the beast 's head and split its skullopen from behind . There was another skeleton beyond it , andlanother and another , a fortune in ivory , a wilderness of death . Jame picked her way through them , her hand again on Jorin 's head . She saw a glow in the mist before her , and a few moments later came up to a pair of diamantine stones each a good nine feet tall . Stepping between them , she found herself in a circle some fifty feet across , ringed with standing stones . No mist came here . It formed a shining roof over the circle and walled it , but Jame could clearly see the huge , gape-mouthed imu faces on the far side , thrusting out of the diamantine lithons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take its natural form so that she seemed to stand in a ring of tall , narrow heads , their chins sunk in the ground . Only two werep159different . One had a sort of leathery caul on top of it . The other 's mouth had been hollowed out so deeply that darkness gathered in the heart of the shining stone . Something moved in the shadowy maw of the second stone . Bortis and the Grindark emerged . The latter crouched like some hunted thing brought to bay at last . Bortis stood beside him , keeping a cruelly tight grip on the hillman 's surviving forebraid . The blind brigand chief was grinning . Saliva ran down from one corner of his mouth to hang in a glistening thread from his chin . Jame approached him slowly , moving on the balls of her feet . " What have you done to Marc ? " Bortis leered crookedly . " So you miss that decrepit boyfriendof yours already , do you ? You had young suitors  --  Bane , that fool Dally  --  and you killed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that afraid of a real man ? " They were circling each other now . The Grindark scuttled sideways , retreating from Jame , but kept in the ring of stone by the bandit 's ruthless grasp . The hillman 's teeth had begun to rattle together . He could both see and sense what Bortis could not : the inhuman , silver sheen growing in their opponent 's eyes , the darkness gathering around her . " I never went out of my way to hurt you , Bortis . " The voice was low , almost purring . " You attacked me . Three times . Does it threaten your manhood that your prey fought back and won ? That was n't supposed to happen , was it ? Oh no , not to the great bandit chief . Well , I blinded you once , and by God , I can do it again . " She sprang at them . The tracker recoiled , jerking his captor off balance . Jame caught the brigand 's thumb and wrenched it away from the Grindark 's hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she tripped him , and he fell sprawling . The Grindark scrambled clear . Clutching his remaining braid with both hands , he scuttled out into the mist . Jame circled the fallen brigand . " Now , what have you done to my friend ? " Bortis lay face down on the ground . His shoulders began to shake . He was laughing . " Oh , it was funny ! H-he thought you were calling him.  |p160Marc  , oh Marcarn " He gave a fair imitation of Jame 's voice , spoiled by an attack of giggles . " I lured him into that doll 's house and  --  and pushed a wall over on him . The floor gave way too . He fell down , then sideways  --  if that whoreson Grindark was n't lying  --  straight through another farking wall ! " The brigandjerked up his head , wet mouth rimmed with dirt . " You 've killed another one ! " he crowed . " Get yourself a new lover , Talisman . The old one 's worm-bait ! " Something colder even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Even she would n't trust her reflexes , falling into something so unexpected . And Marc , as Bortis kept saying , was no longer young . Jorin had cowered away from her to the edge of the circle . She remembered how he had darted off minutes before , and felt suddenly sure that it had been because he had caught the Kendar 's scent . She had called him off then . Not now . " Find him , " she said to the ounce . " Bring him here . . . if you can . " Blind Jorin gave her a wide moon-opal stare . Then he was gone in a flash of gold . Jame circled Bortis again , feeling the cold berserker rage rise , savoring it . " Dear Bortis . Who 's worm-bait ? " Someone on the edge of the ring laughed softly . Jame spun around , Bortis temporarily forgotten . The caul on top of the first stone had raised its head . Diamantine light cast into even greater relief the angry scars that formed the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of it glittered , and the misshapen mouth lifted in a smile . " Ah , child , how you love your work . What a reaper of souls you will make someday . " Jame recoiled a step . Then she quickly drew out the medallioncovered in the changer 's skin and held it up as if it were a protective charm . " You came back , maybe , for your face ? Here it is. " 66So I see . And you 've been feeding it , too . How . . . con-siderate . " The changer gathered himself as if to spring , then collapsed , panting . His face was gray with exhaustion . Jame slowlyp161lowered the imu . The changer 's smile twisted , distorting his warped face even more . " Quite right . Even if this accursed place was n't killing me by inches , after two days aloft with barely a breeze for support , I 'm in no shape to harm you . " " Why did you want to in the first place ? Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master 's eventual downfall . Sweet Trinity , how ? " " Now , child , no games . " " Damnit , it 's true . I do n't remember  --  if I ever knew at all . " " Indeed ? " Malice lit his pale eyes . " Now , would it be more amusing to tell you or not ? I think not . " His gaze suddenly shifted . Jame heard boot leather scrape on stone behind her and turned , just as Bortis charged at the sound of her voice . He knocked her flat . His weight , crashing down full on top of her , drove the air from her lungs . He had her hands pinned above her head before she recovered . His heavy body shook on top of her as he began to giggle uncontrollably . " And now , " said the changer 's cool , malicious voice , " I think that friend Bortis will also amuse himself . " A moaning cry welled up around them , echoed not by walls this time but , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got free an arm and struck him sharply in the nose with the heel of her hand . His head snapped back . She shoved him off and rolled backward into a fighter 's crouch , nails out , ready to defendherself . " Take her , damn you ! " the changer was screaming . " She 's right in front of you ! " Bortis ignored them both . He was listening , mouth agape , blood dripping unnoticed onto his chin . The cry came again , all around them . Its desolation seemed to jar something loose in the man 's broken mind . He bolted , sobbing , between the lithons , out into the mist . Some hunter 's instinct almost sent Jame after him , but then she shrank back . Two figures had come into the circle . For a moment , Jame had the half-dazed impression that they were human : a woman bent with age and grief , a slender , whitehairedchild with fierce red eyes . Then she saw that they were both rathorns . The mare was indeed old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had faded from black to silver gray . Her slim legs trembled under the ivory 's weight , while a massive skull mask bent her head almost to the ground . She breathed in great gasps between bared fangs because the mask 's nasal pits had grown shut . So had one eye socket . She was slowly being buried alive in the ivory tomb of her own armor . Snatches of her scent and the colt 's reached Jame , even though this time they were n't directed at her . With each breath she drew , memories not her own swirled around her : the smell of dawn on the wind , the touch of a snowflake on the tongue , the sound of rathorn stallions belling in an autumn wood . Each memory flashed and died , leaving only a sense of infinite loss . The mare was destroying them one by one , ripping apart the vivid tapestry of her past , unmaking herself a bit at a time because she knew of no other way to die . Jame fought the swift current of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into it . She began to sense the mare 's underlying emotions like great jagged rocks in the riverbed of the rathorn 's consciousness : despair , that so long a life had left so many memories to be destroyed ; rage , that her own traitor body had made such a destruction necessary ; grief , that bit by bit she was losing all the bright , fierce days , all the glowing nights . But most of all she grieved for the colt at her side , her last foal with his white coat and his red , red eyes . Her coming end had put its mark on him even before his birth . Now , the longer she took to die , the longer he was bound to her and her self-destructive agony , the more warped he would become . She foresaw that already no rage would ever accept him . He would grow up bitter and alone , a rogue , a death's-head , her child . She moaned again , and the colt echoed her , furious in his denial : No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " No . . . " breathed Jame , and then with a gasp wrenched her mind away from theirs . If she stayed , the rathorn 's despair would suck her down as it nearly had the colt . If she ran away ... but that was unthinkable . Stupid as it probably was , she could no more turn her back on this mare than on one of her own people in agony , pleading for the White Knife . She drew her own blade.  | " Do n't ! " hissed the changer . His voice rose . " You fool , do n't ... ! " Jame sprang forward on the mare 's blind side . She caught the tusk and jerked the rathorn 's ivory encrusted head around . Like water deep in a well , the mare 's sunken eye caught and held a warped reflection of Jame 's face . The mirrored lips moved . If you kill me , said a cold , precise voice in her head , my child will kill you . Kill me . The eye closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the consequences . So be it . She drew back her knife to strike . The colt 's furious charge sent her sprawling . He had no tusk as yet and his horn was only a bump , but those small ivory hooves splintered rock beside her head . She rolled clear . He came at her again , bounding on his hind legs with fangs bared and forehooves slashing . His scent , rank with rage , sent a scream lancing through her head : No , no , no , no . . Jame slipped aside and spun . Her kick caught him just behind the ear between the undeveloped skull mask and the throat plates . He crashed down , stunned . Jame stood over him , panting . She could kill him now . She should , or he would never stop until he had killed her , if not today , then tomorrow , or next week , or next year . Think of him full grown , a rogue , a death'shead , coming to claim the debt of blood .. She heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rathorn 's head was poised above her , that ponderous weight of ivory balanced on the serpentine neck , ready to smash downward , to pulp flesh and splinter bone . Jame drew a deep shaky breath . " All right . I wo n't hurt him . But if you kill me , I ca n't help you . Do you still want help ? " For a moment , the rathorn did n't move . Then , with a sigh , she lowered her head until her chin came to rest on Jame 's shoulder . Jame had to brace herself as the weight settled . Hesitantly , wonderingly , she ran her fingers along the mare 's mark , along the cool ivory . All this beauty and strength , all this proud spirit about to vanish forever . But everything , eventually , comes to an end , and destruction is only one more face of God . Jamep164took a firmer grip on her knife . Then , with all her strength , she drove the blade through the mare 's eye deep into her brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her ears . That terrible piercing cry went on and on as the rathorn slowly collapsed . Her very soul seemed to be tearing its way to freedom , and the diamantine imus gave back the murderous echo . The changer had curled himself up like a spider on top of his stone , but now he plummeted to the ground , shrieking . Blood and gray matter ran out of his ears . He convulsed once , horribly , and lay still . The stones under him began to crack . Jame took a step toward the edge of the circle and fell , half paralyzed by the noise . The rathorn 's scream was bad enough , but the stones ' echo was raw power , enough easily to kill . But what was that ? A shadow sped past her across the stones , cast by no seen form . It darted to the hollowed-out imu and back again , away and back . No more gray cloak , because the cape in the entry hall had disintegrated at her touch . No more child-sized figure seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones but one had turned to dust . But their mysterious guide would still lead her to safety if only she could follow him  --  but Jame . . . could n't . . . move .. . Running footsteps . Someone snatched her up , and she found herself hurling toward the darkness inside the shining stone . The imu 's mouth swallowed both her and her rescuer . Inside , the diamantine boomed with the rathorn 's scream . Her rescuer stumbled and dropped her . She rolled down steep stairs between booming walls , down into silence . No , not quite silence . The ringing went on and on , only now it was only in her ears . She was lying on stone pavement . More stone seemed to be heaped on her chest , making it hard to breathe . The weight shifted , and a wet nose anxiously touched hers . She threw her arms around Jorin and hugged him as he burst into a thunderous purr . A dying murmur from above still echoed in the stairwell . Then , as it faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of despair , wild for revenge . Jorin went straight up into the air and came down with all his fur on end . Jame scrambled to her feet . She heard hooves thundering down the stair . Oh God , the colt . She must bar his way , but how ? There , folded back against the wall on either sidep165of the stairwell : doors . Their stiffened hinges resisted her at first , but with a final , frantic effort she managed to slam them shut in the colt 's very face . A lock clicked . Almost simultaneously , the young rathorn hit the other side with a boom . Jame felt the door shudder . She heard sharp ivory hooves tear at it , but its panels were made of ironwood and they held . One last scream sounded on the other side and then there was silence . Jame leaned against the wood . She knew as surely as if he had shouted it in her ear what that last cry had meant : If not today , then tomorrow , or next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had daydreamed about riding a rathorn into battle , but here she was instead , launched into a blood feud with one . Just the same , it would probably be years before the colt was old enough to come after her , and , at this rate , she would be lucky to get as far as tomorrow . Let 's just take one crisis at a time , Jame thought , and , for the first time , looked about her . She was in a fair-sized subterranean chamber lined with close-fitted masonry , dimly lit by patches of luminous moss dottingthe floor . It was ringed by open doorways , ten in all . Shining runes marked their lintels . Beside one of them , someone quite large was raising himself on an elbow . " Marc ! " Jame cried , and threw herself into the Kendar 's arms . Jorin pounced on both of them . " But how did you get out of Bortis 's trap , or cross that killing circle up there , or  --  " " Just a minute , lass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear and then the other , dislodging what looked like mud . Jame saw that the little sack of earth from Kithorn was hanging outside his shirt , empty . " Oh , Marc , your home-soil ! " He shrugged . " I thought it might protect me . Luckily , it did . A good thing I hung on to it these sixty odd years , eh ? As for Bortis 's trap , a funny business that was , falling first one direction and then the other . But , you know , those cracked walls practicallypowdered when I hit them . There was no real impact to speak of at all . It took me awhile to climb out ; but when I did , there was Jorin , waiting to guide me here . " " Cracked . . . " Jame thought of those shattered walls , the stones breaking under the changer , the fissured bones . The ghost of an idea began to form in her mind , but before it couldp166take on substance , she started violently . Out of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a voice : " Hello ? Is anyone there ? " Jame sprang to her feet . She had not heard that voice for years , except in dreams , but she had no doubt who was calling to her now . " Tori ! My God , where are you ? Answer me ! " She plunged through the nearest doorway into the tunnel beyond , still calling her brother 's name . Moss formed a luminous carpet for the first few yards , then broke down into clumps , more and more widely spaced . Beyond lay utter darkness . Jame called again . Only echoes replied . Could she have chosen the wrong door ? Yes , easily . She must try again . Jame turned quickly to retrace her footsteps , and again found nothing but darkness before her . Where was the luminous moss ? She could only have come a few yards beyond it , yet now it was nowhere in sight . Marc 's voice called her name . How impossibly far away he sounded . She took a hesitant step toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course : the tunnel must be paved with step-forward stones . Another stride or two and .. . Her foot came down on emptiness . She pitched forward , twisted , clawed at stone , hung there in space by her fingertips , heart pounding . A rock , dislodged , plummeted away . It never seemed to hit the bottom . Instead , from below came a scuffling , scratching sound , oddly furtive . An exhalation of air cold with earth and deep stone breathed up around her . Then Jame almost lost her grip as something touched her hand . It was Jorin . A moment later , Marc caught her wrists and pulled her back up onto the path . " What in Perimal 's name is down there ? " she demanded . Steel struck flint . A spark flashed blindingly in the dark andgrew as dead moss kindled . Marc rose and kicked the blazingclump over the edge . It fell , revealing a deep , narrow crevasserunning parallel to the trail . The chasm 's lower reaches werestudded with rocks , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of light glowed briefly like small feral eyes intheir craggy folds , then all blinked out at once . In the utterp167darkness that followed , the stealthy scratch of claw on stone began again . " Trocks , " said Marc 's voice in the dark . " The Builders brought them to Rathillien . Their digestive juices dissolve stone , you see , so they were useful in temple masonry and , I suppose , in hollowing out tunnels like this . We had better go back to that underground chamber . At least there was some light there ... . Wait . " They listened . " They 're between us and the chamber , " said Jame . " Now what  --  try to make friends ? " " No . These may have been the Builders ' pets once , but they 've run wild for many a long year now . I should n't think even a Builder would care to deal with them now . " " But if they 're stone-eaters , surely they wo n't hurt us . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feet ... . Krothen had an infestation of them in his dungeon at Kothifir once that cleaned out every prisoner he had , not to mention quite a few guards . Most areas around our temples have a problem with them , off and on . They do n't like light , though . " Again the click of steel and flint ; again , a spark . As moss caught fire , Marc tore up a clump and threw it down the passageway . The path was thick with small gray rocks that certainly had n't been there before . They covered the moss . As it caught fire under them , the spreading flames kindled the glow of many eyes , and a piping wail arose . Then the fire came leaping back up the tunnel toward Jame and Marc . They retreated . The walls of the step-forward passage blurred as if they were moving impossibly fast , but the flames followed faster over the carpet of dead moss . Jame and Marc plunged into a side tunnel with Jorin on their heels just as the fire roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long , leaving a path strewn with rapidly dying embers . Darkness closed in again . " We are n't having much luck with fire on this trip , " saidJame in a rather shaken voice . " At least I do n't hear any morescratching . Marc ? " The darkness pressed in around her , moreabsolute than anything she had ever known . " Where are you ? " " Here . " His voice came from somewhere to her right . " Wep168seem to have gotten off the step-forward stones . They probably only line the main passageway . " " But why ? Where does it go ? " " Trinity knows . More to the point , where do we go from here ? Some light should help . " She heard him draw out his fire making tools again , then give a disgusted grunt . " Dropped them . " Joints creaking audibly , he knelt to search the floor . " Do n't bother , " said Jame . " I still have mine . " She groped in a pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell before she could catch it . She did n't hear it hit the floor . The next moment , the flint and steel were snatched from her grasp . " Hey ! Give me a chance . " " What ? " said Marc 's voice , still down by the floor . Jame stood very still . She heard nothing , and yet ... " Marc , I do n't think we 're alone down here . " He rose . " Where are you ? " " Here . " She reached out . A hand closed on hers  --  slim , long fingered , very , very cold . She dropped it with a gasp and sprang back , only to trip over Jorin . That cold grip caught her flailing hand and steadied her . " What on earth are you doing ? " said Marc 's voice behind her . She gulped . " Making someone 's acquaintance , I think , someone who apparently does n't want to be seen and who is n't very tall . " " Our friend in gray ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her grasp . Now its cold fingers tightened and tugged at her . " I think he wants us to go with him . Should we ? " A moment 's silence , then : " Yes , " said Marc . " After all , we 've been following him since this morning . Here . " His own hand , huge and warm , closed over hers . " Lead on . " The darkness confused Jame 's sense of direction , but she was fairly sure that their guide was taking them back to the main corridor . In confirmation the burnt smell grew and then charred moss crunched underfoot . They turned left , away from the subterraneanchamber . Jame went on , one hand gripping the cold fingers that led her , the other engulfed in Marc 's warm grasp as he followed in her wake . Only the sound of her boots and hisp169echoed off the walls , sometimes close by , sometimes far off , as if the path momentarily skirted the edge of some vast cavern . There were depths too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trail at once . How long had they been walking ? Time seemed to slow , almost to stop under the weight of darkness . Where were they going ? If the stones underfoot still stepped forward , they must have already come a considerable distance . Jame 's thoughts spun in circles , snatching at answers that the darkness denied her . She remembered how frightened she had been as a child during the dark of the moon . Perimal Darklinggripped that part of Rathillien that overlapped the next threshold world , the one that had fallen with the Master , but the shadows always sought to expand . Someday they might reach from the planet 's surface up into the orbit of its single moon . If that happened , Perimal Darkling would swallow the moon and soon after both the sun and stars ; that had happened before on other threshold worlds where the Kencyrath had fought and lost . If ever Rathillien 's moon disappeared , the Three People would know that they had lost again . But , in the meantime , for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark , and those below waited anxiously for its reappearance , afraid that the end had come with no one the wiser until too late . But even during " the Dark , " there was some light . Not so here . This would n't do , Jame told herself firmly . If she kept thinkingabout the darkness , it would consume her . To steady herself , she turned her mind back to the mystery of the cracks , and soon came up with some guesses that made her even more uneasy . " Marc . . . " she said . " Suppose the Builders did try to claim the Anarchies . Then suppose the rathorns came back , maybe through these tunnels , and . . . and used the imus to scream the city to pieces , with the Builders still in it . I found a skeleton in that house I explored . It was n't human . There could have been more there , hidden in corners and holes all over the city , where they crawled trying to escape . Perhaps all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 'll be no more temples , " Marc finished , his voice echoing hollowly in the darkness . " If we have to retreat to the next threshold world , we 'll be completely cut off from our god.  |p170Oh  , I do n't like the old grump any more than you do , but withouthim ... ' " Or her , or it . " " ... we 're helpless . " " So , if the Builders are dead , this is it : Rathillien , the Kencyrath 's last battlefield . But if that 's true , just who or what is holding onto my hand ? " She did n't get an answer . Jorin had been walking beside her , his shoulder brushing her leg . Suddenly she felt him stop . His keen ears had caught a faint , distant sound . Jame heard it too , somewhat distorted , through his senses : many claws on stone , rapidly getting closer . The cat began to growl . " Lass ? " " Company , and no more fire to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home when they get here . " Their guide seemed to agree for that cold hand tugged impatiently at Jame . They ran , tripping , stumbling in the dark . Behind them , the scratching sound grew closer , louder , and a thin , excited whistling filled the air . Then between one step and the next , light exploded around them . Half-blinded , Jame skidded to a stop , with Jorin tumbling over her heels . She turned in bewilderment and saw Marc standing behind her , rubbing his eyes . There was a wall close behind him  --  so close , in fact , that his pack seemed to be embedded in it . Then he gave a startled grunt and rocked back on his heels , as if something had given him a sharp pull from behind . The next moment , he surged away from the wall and hastily shrugged off what was left of his pack . It had been ripped open and its contents half dissolved by a slimy gray substance through which white larvae wriggled . " It must be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack back through the apparently solid wall . " I 've heard old songs about gateway barriers like this . Ancestors be praised the songs were right . Now , where 's our guide ? We apparentlyowe him more than we realized . " But the small gray figure from the Anarchies was nowhere in sight . Then Jame realized that she was still holding something . She opened her hand . In it lay the long , slim finger bone from the Builder 's house . It crumbled into dust.  | " Good-bye , friend . " She let it sift through her fingers . " Now , where on earth are we ? " They were standing on the edge of a large , nine-sided chamber . Its walls were painted in a continuous sylvan mural , and rib girders rose from each angle like tree trunks to meet overhead in a tangle of painted leaves , branches , and sky . From the apex of the ceiling hung a light sphere . Jame had seen others like it in Tai-tastigon , but this one was much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a twilight glow now that her eyes had adjusted to it , and apparently had n't been more than that for some time , for the real grass carpeting the room had had begun to die . But what really astonished her was the white , windowless structure standing in the middle of the floor . " Why , it looks just like a model of our god 's temple in Taitastigon ! " she exclaimed . " That 's no model , " said Marc . He looked around in amazement . " I 've heard of this room . We 're in Karkinaroth , Prince Odalian 's palace . But how ? That 's three hundred leagues south of the Anarchies . " " The step-forward stones ! I thought we 'd probably gone quite a distance , but this ... ! " She stopped , struck by a thought . " Marc , there are supposed to be nine Kencyr temples on Rathillien , are n't there ? " " Why , yes . " " There were ten doors in that underground chamber . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Builders ' work , too . Grindark hi amen live there now , but there 's a traditionthat their ancestors were the Builders ' craftsmen . " " So they would have to get to the building sites , too , maybe by a step-forward tunnel to that room under the Anarchies and then on by one of the other nine doors . Well , it 's a thought , anyway . It would at least explain how we got here . " She approached the miniature temple cautiously , wary as always in the presence of her god . " But are you sure this thing is real ? It 's so small . " " Only on the outside . The Builders could be very playful about space . Three priests and nine acolytes are supposed to serve here . " " It does n't look as if anyone has for some time . Why , thep172door is even bolted shut . " She put her hands on it , then jerked them away with a startled exclamation . " There 's power in there . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests ? Trinity , do n't they know how dangerous this could be ? Taitastigonnearly got ripped apart when the temple there was mis-managed . " " I think I hear someone in there . " They leaned as close to the door as they could without touching it . From inside came a whisper of a voice crying over and over in Kens : " Let me out ! Oh God , let me out , let me out ... " Marc Pushed Jame aside . He gripped the rod bolted across the door and pitted the whole of his great strength against it . Muscles bulged , bones creaked , but the rod did n't move . He let go and looked rather blankly at his hands , blistered by the power from within the temple . " This calls for a lever , " he said . He unsheathed his war-axe and regarded its wooden shaft critically . " It might hold up against that rod , but then again . . . " At that moment , three guards wearing the Prince 's buff and gold livery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , one of those will do nicely , " said the big Kendar andstepped forward . " Here , friend , lend me your weapon . Someoneis trapped inside . .. " The guard reversed his spear and struck with its iron shod butt . By skill or luck , he clipped Marc on the head just where Bortis 's brigand had hit him four days earlier . The big man crumpled without a sound . Jame found herself facing two poised spears . " What about the cat ? " one man asked another . " We have no orders about that . Kill it . " " Jorin , run ! " Jame cried , and threw herself forward , twisting . One spear point passed under her arm and the other clashed against it as the second guard tried too late to block her . She dropped the first man with an elbow to the throat . The man who had struck Marc tripped her with his spear shaft . She came up rolling and saw Jorin disappear in a golden streak out the door . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But these people are supposed to be our allies , she thought with amazement , and then thought nothing more at all.  |p173TWO  DAYS after leaving theRiverland , the Host of the Kencyrath seemed to have left behindimpending winter . While Kithorn had been cold and stark , here in the Oseen Hills some three hundred and fifty miles to the south , maples and sumac still blazed red and gold on the slopes and migrating birds flew overhead . Holly , Lord Danior , still rode beside Torisen , shying stones at every dorith tree he saw . Whenever he hit one at just the right moment , in just the right way , all of its leaves fell off at once with a most satisfying " whoosh . " Torisen finally sent the young lord and his riders on ahead to scout the next stretch of road . " Running you ragged , is he ? " said Harn with a chuckle , pulling up beside the Highlord . " Now you know how I felt when I was your commander . " " At least I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things down the line ? " " Just stay away from the Coman . Demoth and Korey are ready to cut each other 's throats or , preferably , yours . Which reminds me . Although you 've sent your regular guard back to their respective commands , you have n't picked your war-guard yet . Now , I 've got my eye on a score or so of your randons who  --  " " Harn , no . We wo n't reach the Cataracts for nearly three weeks . Let it wait . " Harn bristled . " You think nothing can happen before then ? You 've got more enemies than just the Coman , boy , and you 're too valuable to risk . You need protection . "  | " Harp , I 'm not going to spend the rest of this march trippingover a parcel of well-meaning bodyguards . I just do n't like to be followed about . You know that . " " In case you had n't noticed , you 're being followed by the entire Kencyr Host . " " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ham . I promise , I 'll be as sensible as you like  --  when we get to the Cataracts . Now , how are the foot soldiers holding up ? " " Well enough , " said Harn grudgingly , " as long as they get at least one night of dwar sleep out of three . We must be covering a good sixteen leagues a day . Not bad . But to have our strength cut by a third every night when we 're this spread out . . . d' you realize that the line of march stretches back nearly ten miles ? " " We 'll be out of these mountains in two or three days . " " Aye , and on the edge of the White Hills . What d' you think of Caineron 's suggestion that we cut through them instead of following the River Road ? It would save us nearly three hundred miles . " Torisen snorted . " That was n't why he suggested it . My lord Caineron simply wanted to remind everyone of what happened there and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ashes of the dead after Ganth 's defeat . . . no Kencyr had walked there since , and Torisen did n't want to be the first . Who knew what might wait in a place like that ? " Harn , " he said abruptly , changing the topic . " You served with Pereden for a year after I left . How has he shaped up ? " The randon scratched an unshaven chin , his nail rasping on stubble . " Well now , that 's not so easily answered . It was a quiet year , without much to test the boy 's mettle . I would say , though , that Pereden wanted to be a great leader without having to work for it . He seemed to think that command of the Southern Host was only his due . " " So it would have been from the start , if Ardeth had n't given it to me . You know the tradition : where there 's no Knorth heir , the heir of Ardeth commands in the field  --  except when Caineron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull out Urakarn . " " But you were the Knorth heir . " " Yes , but Pereden did n't know that . No one did but Ardethp175until I came of age . You thought I was delirious when I told you in that ruined desert city where you and Burr tracked me down . " " Oh aye . And stayed drunk for a week along with half your staff when we heard you 'd actually made the other lords accept you . " Torisen laughed , then caught his breath sharply . Flashing across the road scarcely a dozen paces away was a rage of five rathorns . The lead stallion spun around to face the Host , fangs bared . Sunlight fell on the blackness of his coat , blazed off his two horns and wealth of ivory . Every war horse in the vanguard rocked back on its heels , wild-eyed . Not one would have stood its ground if the great beast had charged . Instead , he gave a scornfulsnort and bounded over the Silver after his rage . A moment later , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . " Trinity ! " breathed Harn , soothing his frightened mount . " That was quite an omen . " " Of what ? I think the emblem of my house just laughed in my face . But where on earth did they come from ? " He dismounted and followed the rathorns ' path , clearly marked by trampled grass . Ahead there seemed to be nothing but a vine-covered cliff face . As he drew nearer , however , Torisen saw darkness behind the leaves . He pushed the vines aside . Behind them was the mouth of a tunnel , high vaulted , lined with smooth , expertly fitted stones . The shaft seemed to go back a long , long way . Its cold breath , heavy with the smells of earth and rathorn , breathed in his face . A faint , confused murmurarose from the black distance , almost like the sound of voices . " Hello ? Is anyone there ? " His voice echoed back harshly again and again and again . He caught his breath , feeling as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , somewhere , far , far away , someone called his name . The unburnt dead come for you out of darkness , calling , calling , and if you answer , you are lost . But that was only how he and Jame used to frighten each other as children . It was just a silly game born out of a stupidp176superstition ... about as stupid as believing that someone down there in the dark actually knew his name . Harn called to him from the road . " Blackie ! Here comes Ardeth . " The Lord of Omiroth was riding up toward the vanguard on his gray Whinno-hir mare Brithany , a matriarch of the herd and Storm 's granddam . Kindrie , the two Kendar scrollsmen , and Ardeth 's war-guard followed him at a distance . Harn grunted . " Confrontation time , huh ? I 'd better take myself off , then . " He cantered back toward the main body of the Host , saluting Ardeth as he passed . Torisen swung back up onto Storm and waited , not without some trepidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older man had dressed him down for not honoringhis obligation to Kindrie . " My lord , my lady . " He included both Highborn and horse in a wary salute . Ardeth , to his surprise , looked almost embarrassed . " My boy , it seems I owe you an apology . I did n't know that the changer who attacked you at Tentir was a Shanir , much less that he was bound to a darkling wyrm . " " Kindrie saw the wyrm ? Good . I was beginning to think that I 'd imagined it . But he waited this long to tell you ? " " You never told me at all , " said Ardeth , a trifle sharply . " Still , what cursed luck that it was a Shanir . The Old Blood can be dangerous . It opens us up to god-born powers few of us still know how to control . But is it necessarily so foul a thing , say , to share senses with an animal ? Now , if it were Brithany here instead of some crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " said Torisen , and gave a startled yelp as the mare nipped his leg . " Sorry , my lady . Forgive me ? " He held out his hand to her . She made as if to snap at his fingers , but only grazed them with a velvet lip . " You always were one of her favorites , " said Ardeth , smiling . " That was in part why I took a chance on you in the first place . " " So that 's why you introduced us that first night . The lord of Omiroth , taking advice from a gray mare . Hey ! " Storm , growing jealous , had turned to snap at Ardeth 's foot.  |p177Brithany  put back her ears . Her grand-colt subsided , chastened and a bit sulky . " The idiot child , " said Ardeth , regarding him coolly . " Why do n't you look for a full-blooded Whinno-hir ? I know of at least one three-year-old in the herd who would be honored to bear you . " Even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . Storm does . Besides , he 'll take me straight through a stone wall if I ask him to , without an argument . " " As I said , an idiot . Look ! " Across the river , a flight of azure-winged butterflies rose from the tall grass at the sound of the horses ' hooves , then settled back again out of sight . " Jewel jaws , " said Torisen absently . " There must be somethingdead in the grass . " He peered ahead down the road . " Holly'sbeen gone a long time . I sent him ahead to check out the next post station . " " You expect trouble ? " " I do n't really know . We should have had news from the south before now , unless the post-rider has been waylaid somewhere along the line . " " Or no one escaped to send word , " Ardeth concluded bleakly . He turned to watch two more swarms of butterflies dancing above the grass , then gave himself a shake . " Your pardon , my boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of death . This post system of yours is really remarkable . Imagine , news from the far side of Rathillien in only ten days . Of course , if you put the Shanir to work on it , they might come up with something even faster ... " " No . " " Ah well . Have it your way . It must be quite a job , though , protecting stations in this wilderness . " " I have an arrangement with the local warlord , one Grisharki . If he were a Grindark like his followers , I would trust him more , but he comes from the Ebonbane and boasts that he was the lieutenant of some famous brigand there named Bortis . " " Grindark , " Ardeth repeated thoughtfully . " An odd people , that , with an even odder connection to us . " " Because they 're supposed to have been the Builders ' workmen ? " Torisen asked  | " Oh , there 's no doubt that they were , my lord , " said the young historian eagerly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speciality , you know , when I qualified for the scrollsman 's robe . I know all about them . " Ashe , riding a length behind him , cast up her eyes , but the two Highborn smiled at his enthusiasm . Ardeth gave him a half bow . " Well , scholar , will you share your learning or leave us in outer darkness ? " The historian blushed  --  with embarrassment , gratification , or both . " It seems that once the Grindarks were like any other hill tribe , if poorer than most , " he said . " Then the Builders came . They offered the Grindarks rewards and secret knowledgeif they would work for them . Of course , the Grindarks agreed , especially since their first job was to seal off the Anarchiesfrom the other rival tribes . " " How ? " Torisen asked . " I ca n't explain , lord , and neither can they . They 've also forgotten how they built a city in the Anarchies , and the temples themselves . Oh yes , they also built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet they do n't remember how they did that either , " Ashe muttered . " Forgetful bunch of buggers . " The historian laughed . " Not as forgetful as the Chief Builder , though . He had something  --  a talisman , a device , I do n't know what  --  that was supposed to protect him and his people from the Anarchies . When the temples were done and the Builders moved on , the Grindarks were to have it and the city in the Anarchies . Considering how all the hill tribes feel about that place  --  sacred ground and all that  --  you can imagine what a prize it was . So the Grindarks worked like madmen putting up eight of the temples around Rathillien and most of the ninth in Kothifir . Then one morning not a single Builder was waiting to direct them . Instead , they found this talisman , this Men-than as they call it , just lying where the Chief Builder had apparently forgotten it the night before . Why finish the temple at all , the Grindarks asked themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaving to win and run with it ? " " The Builders might have had something to say about that , " Ardeth said . " Ah , but you see , lord , the Grindarks had convinced them/selves that this thing , whatever it was , was the source of the Builders ' power . They thought if they had it , they could do anything . But when one of them put it on , it quite neatly cut his head off . " Torisen had been watching the scavenger jewel jaws on the far shore . How many there were , five more flights at least , each one dancing over something hidden in the tall grass . Holly had been gone such a long time . . . Then the historian 's words penetrated his abstraction and he started , one hand going to the silver collar of the Kenthiar , which he wore again . Ardeth noticed the gesture . " And that was n't all , either , " the young scrollsman was saying with relish . " They suddenly noticed that they were startingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , just those connected with things the Builders had taught them , like how to set step-back stones , or read the Builders ' runes . It was the Builders ' revenge , they thought , for their treacherous intentions . They panicked and bolted , all the way back to Wyrden . And there they 've been ever since , dwindling in number , periodicallyunder siege by the other tribes , who suspect they had something to do with closing the Anarchies . " " That 's quite a remarkable story , " said Ardeth . " I commend your research . Now , about this Men-than . . . Torisen stiffened in the saddle . " Hoofbeats , " he said tersely . Brithany tossed her head , nostrils flaring . " And smoke , " said Ardeth . Lord Danior and his war-guard careened around a curve in the road , nearly barreling into the vanguard . " Tori , trouble . . Torisen spurred past him . The road twisted back and forth , hugging the curve of the river , past larch and maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wet stink . He rounded a clump of red sumac and there were the ruins of the station , still smoldering . Four figures in hieratic robes waited motionless in the middle of the road . As Torisen rode up , he saw that each one was fixed on a sharpened stake driven up through the body . Each face under its hood wore a seething mask of blue butterflies . He brushed the insects away from one . Behind him , Donkerri leaned over his horse 's neck , retching . " Does anyone know this man ? "  | " He was the priest in charge of the mission to Karkinaroth , " said Kindrie . Gingerly , he brushed clear the other faces . " These were his acolytes . I trained with them . " Torisen glanced at him , then abruptly away . " Friends ? " " No . When a Shanir has no liking for the priesthood , the other initiates consider it their duty to break him to it . But none of them deserved this . " Torisen wheeled Storm away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pyre . Check the ruins for more bodies , and also the far bank of the river . Follow the jewel-jaws . Donkerri . . . get control of yourself , boy . All right ? Then ride back for Harn . Tell him what 's happenedand where we 've gone . Also tell him to keep the column moving on the main road . Kindrie , you 'd better go with Donkerri . " Because he still could n't bring himself to look at the Shanir , Torisen did n't see the surprise and then the hurt in the young man 's faded eyes . " Y-yes , my lord , " Donkerri was stammering , " but where are you going ? " " Why , to Wyrden , Grisharki 's stronghold . Where else ? " THE WARLORD 'S FORTRESS was barely five minutes ' fast ride back into the Oseen Hills . Torisen caught a glimpse of its square white towers as Storm burst from a defile into the narrow valley that housed it . Ardeth and Burr rode at his stirrups with the former 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torisen twisted around to see the first of Ardeth 's guard crash down , entangled in a net thrown from above . Thrashing horses blocked the mouth of the defile . " ' Ware attackers ! " Burr shouted , and the next moment toppledfrom his horse with a grunt as a rock hit him . Grindarks rushed in on them down the steep slopes . Ardeth was thrown as Brithany sprang nimbly away from her assailants . A body crashed into Torisen . He fell , locked in powerful arms , but twisted in midair to land on top . A bearded face snarled up at him . He smashed the man 's larynx with a fire-leaping strike and sprang clear , drawing his short sword . A stone hit his elbow , numbing it . The sword dropped from nerveless fingers . Hep181made a grab for it with his other hand , but at that moment his arms were seized from behind and wrenched back . A Grindark picked up the fallen blade . Torisen stared at him . My God ! he thought with blank amazement . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm to strike . Then his eyes fell , widening , on Torisen 's throat , laid bare in the struggle . The Kenthiar gleamed coolly against the tanned skin . The Grindark fell back a step , then another , whining . He dropped the sword . For a moment , it looked as if he might bolt , but then he flopped down suddenly and lay groveling in the dirt . Torisen 's arms were released . He turned sharply , ready to strike , but this assailant too stood staring as if thunderstruck . Then his eyes rolled up and he tumbled down in a dead faint . " Men-than , " another Grindark breathed , and dropped to his knees . " Men-than , Men-than . . . " The word went through the hillmen 's ranks like the breath of terror , and they went down , one way or another . The smell of voided bowels arose . Torisen was left standing in their midst , rubbing his bruised arm and looking rather bemused . Then he saw Burr nearby and went quickly to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , lord . " The Kendar rose unsteadily , wiping blood from a cut on his forehead . " They were only after you . " " Brithany , back , lady . Careful .... " The mare had been standing over Ardeth protectively . Now she stepped back , placingher delicate hooves as if among unbroken eggshells . The Highborn stirred , groaning . Torisen helped him up . " My lord ? " " All right , my boy , all right . What happened ? " " I guessed correctly about the Kenthiar and so , I think , did you . " Meanwhile , Ardeth 's guard had disentangled itself and came galloping down to secure the unresisting prisoners . The trap could only have held them a few minutes in any event , but if its sole purpose had been to kill the Highlord , a few minutes were all the attackers would have needed . " Now what , my lord ? " " We pay our little visit to Grisharki. "  |p182They  rode down the valley to Wyrden , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far slope with steep cliffs behind it . It was square , with a tower at each corner and a crenelated battlement lined with the decayingheads of tribesmen from farther back in the hills , with whom the Grindarks waged continual war . Brown stains ran down from the crenels . The whole fortress was not very large , but its white walls gave the impression of great strength . Torisen rode within hailing distance of the closed gate . " Announceme , " he said to Burr . The Kendar took a deep breath . " Torisen , Lord Knorth , Highlord of the Kencyrath , summons Grisharki , Warlord of the Grindarks ! " he roared . An arrow struck the ground between Storm 's forefeet , makinghim dance backward . Laughter sounded . " You fool ! " It was Grisharki himself , leaning out between two merlons , the wind in his black bush of a beard . " You escape one trap and walk straight into another ! I can shoot you down from where I stand , you and every half-wit with you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire Host down on you ! " Burr shouted back . Grisharki spat . " That , for your Host ! Run away while you can , little lord . You ca n't take this place by storm and you have n't time for a siege . " " He was willing to risk both before when he ambushed us , " said Ardeth . " Why settle for a warning now ? " " I expect friend Grisharki has had second thoughts . Who knows what the Host might do with sufficient provocation ? " " Hmmm . Just the same , he 's right : we ca n't waste any more time here . " " Waste ? " Torisen gave him a sharp look . " With the priests ' blood price still unpaid ? Yes , damnit , we have n't the time , but how does he know ? " " Sir , can you read the runes over the door ? " Burr asked the historian in an undertone . " No , unfortunately . If I could , we could order the gate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " Torisen overheard . " Perhaps we still can . You . " He gestured imperatively to the captured Grindarks . They shuffled forward apprehensively , so close together for mutual support that theyp183practically trod on each other 's toes . " Do you believe that this collar is the Men-than ? " Twenty dark heads nodded in unison . " Do you still believe that the wearer of the Men-than can do anything  --  even destroy Wyrden ? " " Y-yes . " " Then go and tell your brothers that . " They gawked at him for a moment , then turned and bolted for Wyrden in a compact knot , tripping over each other 's heels . The main gate opened a crack and they piled in . It shut again with a clang . Up on the battlements , Grisharki crowed with triumph . " It occurs to me , somewhat belatedly , that you could have taken the priests ' blood price from that poor rabble , " said Ardeth . " After all , they 're the ones who attacked us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want the man who swore to protect the post station and then broke his word . I want Grisharki . " Ardeth gave him a sidelong look . " You know , my boy , sometimes I find you almost alarming just like your father . " Torisen stiffened . Then one corner of his mouth relaxed into a wry , twisted smile . " If you 're going to insult me , I 'm leaving . " " My dear boy , where ? " Torisen stripped off his heavy black coat and handed it to Burr . " Guess . " " Here now , " said Ashe sharply , spurring her horse in front of Storm . " You are n't thinking straight . They 're all back inside Wyrden now , behind virtually impregnable walls . D' you think they 're still going to fall flat at a word from you ? " " After having been scared literally shitless ? It would n't surprise me . Move , Ashe , please . " She did , reluctantly , and he rode forward , sunlight glinting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from Wyrden 's wall . " Open your gate for the Men-thaHI " Grisharki jeered down at him from the battlements , his voice sounding strangely far away . When Torisen glanced up , he saw that the walls rose higher and higher as he approached them , looming fifty feet , seventy-five , one hundred . No wonder besieging forces down through the millennia had lost heart be/fore this place , even if much of that height was probably an illusion . " Stop right there ! " Grisharki shouted down at him in a voice rapidly growing fainter with distance . " All right , damn you , you 've been warned . Archers ! " He should never have left his coat behind , Torisen thought . Its braided inserts of rhi-sar leather would have turned aside any shaft . Giving the Grindarks another clear glimpse of the dreaded collar was hardly worth being turned into a pincushion by their arrows . The shadow of Wyrden fell across him , striking cold through his thin shirt . Storm crab-stepped nervously toward the gate  --  fifty feet , thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archers ? " The warlord 's voice barely reached Torisen now . " Where the hell . . . ? " Inside the fortress , there were sounds of confusion . Fifteen feet to the gate , five , and it swung open before him . The inner courtyard was full of kneeling Grindarks . Ardeth , Burr , and the others charged in through the gate after him , swords drawn , and had to pull up sharply to keep from plowing into the crowd . " Well , I 'll be damned , " said Ardeth , staring about him . Torisen had also been scanning the bowed heads . No black bushy beard , and fewer Grindarks than he had expected . " Where are the rest of you ? " he demanded . " Sent east on the road to Peshtar , one , two , three days ago , " answered a grizzled hillman . " I swear it . " He touched his forehead , which was scored by a band of scars very similar in shape to the runes on the Kenthiar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now , " said Ashe . " See that a one-hundred command is sent after them to provide protection , " Torisen said to Burr . " If they 've been molestedtoo , I want the head of every Grindark responsible . Now , bring me Grisharki and his first lieutenant . " He dismounted and walked into the main hall . Outside , it did n't look very large , but inside it was enormous . Flagstones stretched nearly out of sight in both directions , a vast , stone-laid field under the smoke blackened sky of a roof so far up that it could barely be seen . Here the Grindarks camped , their habitualsqualor scarcely noticeable in such immense surroundings.  |p185The  Grindarks shoved a narrow-faced man into the hall  --  Grisharki 's second-in-command , apparently . And the warlord himself ? The hillmen shook their heads . He was n't outside , and as for the hall , well , my lord could see for himself . Torisen looked down to find a small , incredibly grubby child tugging at his sleeve . It pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the hearth . " Build me a fire , " Torisen said . Ardeth 's riders piled filthy straw bedding in the grate and kindled it while the children all gathered around , delighted . Flames and black smoke roared up the chimney . Inside , there was a muffled howl . A man tumbled out onto the hearth , smeared with soot , his clothes smoldering . The children cheered . Ardeth 's riders seized him . " Well , Grisharki , " said Torisen , " what have you to say for yourself ? " The warlord drew himself up to his full , not inconsiderable height and glared down through the singed remains of his beard . " This is the way you honor our contract ? What 's the matter with you , man ? Ca n't you take a little joke between friends ? " " A joke . I swore to deal with you as you dealt with me , Grisharki , and I always keep my word . Someone , prepare a sharpened stake . " Grisharki crumpled as if the bones had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! " he babbled . " I was against that , but he made me do it . He said it would bring you running , and then . . . and then .... Lord , he bewitched me into it ! " " Who , Grisharki ? " " T-the stranger with the imu burned into his face  --  a demon , I swear ! All his features kept shifting . Why , he could n't even keep his nose on straight ! " " Another changer , " said Ardeth . A guard approached and saluted . " Lord , the stake is ready . " " Take him to it . " Grisharki pitched forward with a howl and groveled at the Highlord 's feet . Torisen regarded him dispassionately . " I always honor my word , Grisharki , but there is some room for mercy . Kill him first , " he said to the guards . They dragged the man away.  |p186His  lieutenant watched , rigid and silent . His eyes snapped to Torisen 's face as the Highlord turned to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Grisharki is a poor enough blood price , and yet . . . As his successor , will you take the oath that he took , to protect my post station and never raise your hand against my people ? " The man 's head jerked in a nod . " And you really believe you can trust him ? " demanded Ardeth . " I think I can , if he swears on this . " Torisen took off the Kenthiar and held it out by the edges . The man stared at it , wild-eyed , then reached out desperately and gripped it . " I swear . . . all ! " His fingers fell to the floor , neatly severed , the wounds instantly cauterized . " That was a false oath . Swear again , with your other hand . It 's that or the stake , man , " he added in a lower voice . " Swear . " fi The Grindark swore and sat down abruptly on the hearth , white-faced but with one hand intact at least . Torisen started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let the wretched thing settle down a bit first . " He glanced at the fingers still lying on the floor . " The longer , the better , eh ? " Ashe had been looking through a pile of gear halfway down the hall . Now she raised her voice in a hail : " My lord ! " Just then , there was a commotion outside , and Ham stormed in . " You young idiot ! " he roared , startling bats off thej ! I high rafters . " What d' you think you 're playing at , charging off like that and nearly getting yourself killed ? I 'm the berserker , I 'll have you know , not you ! " " Why is n't anyone ever pleased to see me ? " said Torisen rather plaintively , and went to see what Ashe had found , leaving Harn open-mouthed . Ashe handed him a post-rider 's pouch , its seal broken . The dispatch was still inside . Torisen drew it out and read , his expressionbecoming grim. 66So this was how Grisharki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He turned to find the lord of Omiroth already there , reach/ing for the dispatch . Ardeth read . A stricken look came into his eyes . " We must make haste . Now , Tori , now . " " Yes , now . " He took the old man 's hands and held them for a moment . Then he was off down the hall , shouting for Ham , They rode out minutes later , past the rigid figure of Grisharki mounting silent guard at his own door , down the valley , out through the defile . The stench of burning flesh met them . The souls of the priests and their escorts had been freed by fire , never again to walk in the shadow of their dread god . The main body of the column was just coming up the road . Torisen called over the randon captain in charge of the first Knorth one hundred . " There 's been a massacre , " he told him . " The Southern Host has been virtually wiped out except for a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get there as quickly as possible to cover their retreat . That means a faster pace with one night 's dwar sleep out of two , and a route that lies through the White Hills . You 've got all that ? " " Yes , lord , " said the captain . Lord Danior had ridden over to listen . " The White Hills , eh ? " he said , rather uneasily . " Do you think that 's wise ? " " Probably not , but what choice do we have ? " Behind them , the captain was repeating the Highlord 's words verbatim to his command and to the next captain down the line . As the news spread from group to group , a murmur rose among the ranks , then died into grim silence . Many of these Kendar had once served in the Southern Host ; nearly all had friends or kin there who might well be feeding vultures or worse now on that distant battlefield . This was their fight now , even more than their lords ' . The one-hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he dropped it , and his command rocked forward as one into the loping stride that eats up nearly seventy miles a day as steadily and inexorably as the sun falls . Sunlight glinted on shield and helm , on sword hilt and spear point . Torisen reined aside to watch them pass , line after line , proud , fierce , deter/mined . Then he cantered forward to take his place in the vanguard . Behind him , the captains called the running chant , their seconds on the far wing taking every other line . Two days ' march ahead lay the White Hills.  |p189JAME  DREAMED that she sat on a fur rug beside a cold hearth . A vast hall stretched out before her , paved with dark green-veined stone , lined with death banners . Someone leaned against the mantelpiece behind her . She could n't turn to see who it was but his presence warmed her as the fireplace never could . " Who are you ? " she demanded . The voice answered in a fading whisper : " Ah , Jamie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying , " Tirandys , Senethari ! " But no one was there . The hearth was cold , and the skin beneath her that of an Arrin-ken . The nails of its flayed paws flexed on stone . Scee , sceee , sceeeee . . Jame woke with a gasp and sat up  --  too fast . A lightning stabof pain shot through her head , then slowly faded to a dull ache . She touched the back of her head gingerly and felt a considerablelump . Why , someone hit me , she thought dizzily , then rememberedwho and under what circumstances . The grogginesswas largely the aftermath of dwar sleep . Sweet Trinity , how longhad she been unconscious ? She raised her head and lookedabout . No windows . No way even to tell if it was day or night . But if the room lacked a view , it had just about everythingelse , including nine sides . The canopied bed in which she sat wasagainst one of them . Across a white marble floor was a smallfireplace with a gracefully carved stone mantel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kar/kinaroth had been rude , Jame thought , looking around her , at least someone was trying to make her stay comfortable . Best of all , on a slender-legged table by the bed was a plate neatly piled with fruit and honey cakes . Beside it stood a flagon of cool white wine . Jame 's last meal had been in the Anarchies  --  days ago , if her hunger was any indication . She ate and drank ravenously , gettingcrumbs everywhere . The wine had a curious aftertaste , but she ignored it . Who knew what spices the southern vintners might use ? Then she dusted off her hands and rose to inspect the room . The marble floor felt cool on her bare feet , but her boots were nowhere in sight . For that matter , neither were her clothes . Jame shook down her long black hair for warmth and padded over to the fireplace . She did n't see any sign of her knapsack on the floor or under the bed . Damn . The Book Bound in Pale Leather could usually take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were her responsibility . She began to look behind the tapestries on the walls for any kind of alcove where her gear might have been stored . Behind five of the seven hangings and the bed , she found only blank walls . The sixth swung aside to reveal another smaller room , lined with tiles and fitted with a sunken bath as well as with other essentials . The seventh tapestry , opposite it , concealed a locked door . Someone apparently thought that that and the lack of clothingcould keep her a prisoner here . Someone was about to get a surprise . Jame knelt by the door , extended a nail , and began to pick the lock . She had to get out . There was the knapsack to find , of course , but most of all she was worried about Marc . The Kendar had also been hurt , perhaps badly . She must find him and Jorin too , who was ( she hoped ) still free , even though he would be having to cope in strange territory without the use of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but got no answer . Damn and blast . If only her head ached less and her thoughts were clearer ! But why had they been attacked in the first place ? Prince Odalian was supposed to be an ally of the Kencyrath . None of this made any sense . There was a sharp click inside the lock . Jame opened thep191door a crack and peered out . No guards . She stepped cautiously into the hall and turned to shut the door after her . Its outer surface was scored with deep , raw scratches that formed the crude outline of a dagger . Jame stared at them , teased by some half memory but unable to grasp it . She shrugged and turned away . The hall curved off in both directions , silent and empty . Which way to go ? In the absence of all information , it hardly mattered . She went left . Other rooms opened off the corridor , all of them lit . They seemed to be guest quarters , each one more opulent than the last . Some gave the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any of them now . Then came a sweeping staircase leading down into a suite of larger public rooms . She drifted on from room to room like a ghost , looking for some sign of life or even for a window that might give her a glimpse of the outside world . There was none . The palace seemed completely shut in on itself , locked in some indolent dream of sweet-scented wood and marble and tapestried princes riding forever under cloudless skies . But at last she came upon a new current moving through the heavy perfumed air . It brought with it a different odor , one that refused quite to define itself but that seemed as disturbingly out of place here as a whiff of decay in a king 's bower . Jame followed it out of the suite to the head of another staircase , again sweeping downward . She descended . A broad corridor stretched away before her at its foot . Ahead , the light spheres glowed more dimly . An almost tangible darkness hung in the air , shrouding the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw with amazement that the corridor itself seemed to fade in the distance . Some of its lines remained but were suspended ghostlike in midair . Beyond , space seemed to open out into a much larger hallway . A cold wind breathed out of that farther hall , lifting Jame 's hair in black , fluttering wings about her face . With it came that odor , stronger now , like the breath of ancient sickness . Jame shivered . She knew that smell , but what was it ? If only her mind were clearer ! Just the same , in another moment surely she could identify it . A hand closed on her bare shoulder . Without thinking , she caught it and spun around . The manp192thumped down on one knee , his arm stretched stiffly up , immobilizedby a Senethar wrist lock . " You 're hurting me , " he said through his teeth , in Kens . Jame let go , astonished . " Who are you ? " The man still cringed at her bare feet  --  or was he a boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to guess . He showed his teeth again . " My lady calls me Gricki . " Jame repeated the name with distaste . It was uncomfortablyclose to the Easternese word for excrement . " I ca n't call you that . " " As you wish , lady . " He was n't about to tell her his real name , Jame realized . After all , that was hardly a safe gift to make to any stranger . " Well , I ca n't put a wrist lock on you every time I want to get your attention . I 'll call you Graykin . " The moment the word was out , she could have bitten her tongue . Graykin was the name of a mongrel dog in one of the old songs ; but he had been a faithful brute and , in his own way , something of a hero . The young man shot her a startled , not displeased look , instantly suppressed . " Graykin , where is everybody ? " " Gone .. . lady . " He gave the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to take offense . " Yes , but where , and why ? " He clearly did n't want to tell her , but the direct question forced a direct answer from him . " Fifteen days ago , Prince Odalian learned that the Horde was on the move , coming this way . He immediately sent out messengers to summon the Karkinoran troop levies and to request help from the Kencyr Highlord . That night , he had a visitor . Do n't ask me who , " he added defensively , as if this ignorance diminished his credit . " I do n't know . The next day , with no explanation whatsoever , he ordered everyone out of the palace . There are only three guards here now , and the Prince and his lady ( who refused to go ) , and the spook . " " The what ? " " Spook . I do n't know where he came from , but I think the Prince and his guards stayed to hunt him . Odd-looking man . Face like a year-old corpse . D' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's strange . " He gave her a sly , sidelong look . " He seems to know you . At least , I caught him scratching on your door . " A man waited in the shadow of the stair , his face a death 's head . He slipped a white-hilted knife into her hand . She went on climbing , climbing , toward a doorway barred with red ribbons , toward the darkness beyond .. . Jame shivered . That was the memory that the scratched drawing of the dagger had half awakened ; but the stair , the knife , and the skull-faced man had all been in Perimal Darkling years ago . Even now , she did n't remember enough to know what that fragment of a memory meant . Anyway , there were more important things to think about now . " Graykin , you only mentioned six people , seven , counting yourself . I 'm looking for my friends  --  a big man with graying hair and a golden ounce . They must be here somewhere , too . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know every room here , yes , and every cell in all seven dungeons , too . " " What do you know about that ? " Jame pointed down the corridor into the darkness . This time Graykin shivered . " That is n't part of Karkinaroth . I do n't know what it is or where it came from . Since the stranger'svisit , it 's simply been there , getting more visible all the time , taking over . " " Graykin , who is your lady ? " " Why , Lyra , my prince 's consort , my lord Caineron 's daughter . " " I had better meet her . " " Yes . . . yes , of course . " This time he really cringed , as if a whip had been raised against him . " This way , lady . " He led her back up into the palace , away from the phantom corridor . Jame followed , glancing at him curiously . He had called her " lady . " Was that just his cringing way , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marc never had . Perhaps some Kencyr were quicker to make the distinction than others  --  but was Graykin a Kencyr ? Her own impression of him was curiously mixed . They had come through quite a tangle of hallways when the young man stopped and scratched tentatively on a door . No answer . He opened it anyway and slipped furtively inside . Jamep194followed . She found herself in a lavish suite of rooms , all red and gold , plush and velvet . Rich carpets covered the floor ; richer hangings , every inch of the walls . All showed exquisite craftsmanshipexcept one , a stitchery portrait of a young , fair-haired , brown-eyed man , so clumsily done that it could only be the work of a Highborn . Under it , flames leaped in an ornate fireplace . The suite was hot and airless . There were , of course , no windows . Graykin was hastily fishing bruised apples and battered cakes out of his pockets and piling them on a table . Jame wondered if he had provided the food in her room , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Graykin dropped an apple and bolted for the door . Too late . A girl stood silhouetted on the threshold of an inner room . " Oh , " she said , scornfully . " It 's just you . Oh ! "  --  in a different tone  --  " Food ! " She came quickly into the light , her long crimson skirt swirling . Above that was a broad gold belt , an embroidered bodice that looked painfully tight , full sleeves , gloves , and a mask . From her voice and the way she moved , Jame guessed that she was about fourteen . Then she saw Jame and stopped short . " Oh ! But you 're dressed ... I mean undressed . . . I mean . . . wait ! " Lyra darted back into the inner room and out again clutching a scrap of cloth that she thrust into Jame 's hand . Jame stared at it , then shrugged and put it on . It was a mask . " I would be honored if you would share bread with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impolite to demand her guest 's name , and the Prince 's consort clearly meant to be very correct indeed , despite her hunger . She cut an apple into precise pieces and offered each section to Jame first before wolfing it down , III III bruises and all . " Really , it 's so awkward , " she said . " Odalian should at least have remembered to keep a few servants and a cook on hand , but then he 's so impetuous . " " Why did he order everyone to leave in the first place ? " Under her mask , Lyra seemed to frown . Direct questionsp195apparently were impolite too , at least by Southron standards , but it would n't do to remind a guest of that . " I suppose he wants to lead out as large an army as possible when he goes to meet the Kencyr Host , " she said rather vaguely . Even palace maids and pastry cooks ? " When does the army march ? " " Oh , I never bother with details . Gricki ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the young man said from the shadows by the door where he had retreated , apparently in hopes of being overlooked . " Both the Host and the Horde are expected to reach Hurlen above the Cataracts around the thirtieth . " " Clever Gricki . " Lyra smiled , with a touch of malice . " He always knows the details  --  about everyone and everything . Do n't you , Gricki ? " Jame hastily interrupted . " Lady , would it be possible to pay my respects to the Prince ? " Lyra glanced up at the portrait over the fireplace . " If you can find him . Oh ! " She rose abruptly , flustered . " That is , he 's been so busy lately . Duties here and there ... I hardly ever see him myself . But it 's all quite normal , you know . " She gave Jame an anxious look . " There certainly have n't been any violationsof the contract . " " Contract ? " " You know , " said Lyra as if to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for review at Midwinter . My father , Lord Caineron , wo n't renew it if anything is , well , not quite right . Then I would have to leave . But if the Prince helps Father win at the Cataracts , maybe he will even extend the contract to includechildren . Oh , I would love that ! " Jame stared at her . " Do n't you have anything to say about it ? " Lyra stared back . " Of course not ! Lord Caineron is the head of my family . Naturally , I have to do what he tells me . " " Naturally , " Jame echoed , looking peculiar . " But then you wo n't tell my lord father anything about this because you 're a woman like me , " said Lyra with an abrupt , sunny smile . It fell away as she turned on the young man in the shadows . " And you wo n't because there 's nothing to tell ! Do you promise ? "  | " Lady , " said Graykin miserably , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dart at him , small fists clenched . " You will promise , Gricki or .. or I 'll tell this lady some detailsI do know about you . Think , Gricki . " From the way she spat out the nickname , Jame knew that it meant the same thing in Southron as in Fasternese . The young man cringed . " Lady , please .. " " Lady , lady , ' " she mimicked him , then spun around , skirt belling , to face Jame . " Do you like riddles ? Here 's one : What do you call a half-Kencyr  --  half-Southron bastard ? Answer : Anythingyou want . " Graykin abruptly left the room , not quite slamming the door . Jame stared after him . " I did n't know that sort of a blood-cross was possible . Who made the experiment ? " Lyra shrugged , already losing interest . " Oh , a kitchen wench and someone in my father 's retinue , apparently . He visitedKarkinaroth about twenty years ago when Odalian 's father was prince . Will you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke in a breathless whisper . " Oh , please do ! I could n't say it in front of that ... that sneak , but things have been so strange here , and I 've been so frightened . Will you ? " " I 'll try , lady , " said Jame , and made her escape . Out in the hall , she leaned against the door and took a deep breath . Those awful , airless rooms ! Was that how a Highborn woman lived , bound in a stifling world of convention and obedience ? Would Tori try to make her into another Lyra ? To be a pawn sent here or there as politics demanded , to warm this man 's bed or bear that one 's children , to live in stuffy halls for the rest of her life . Jame shivered . But a great deal could happen before then . She might even manage to get herself killed . Somewhatcheered , she turned and saw Graykin sitting on the floor against the wall , sharp chin on sharp knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She tells everyone when she remembers , " he said in a muffled voice . " She remembers when she sees me . " " Look , Graykin .. . " Do n't you mean Gricki ? " " No , I do not . You 're no more responsible for your blood/lines than . . . than I am for mine . Look , running around like this may be good for the circulation , but I 'm starting to get cold . Can you find me some clothes ? " He gave her a sharp look . " Some of Lyra 's , d' you mean ? " " Trinity , no . " She took off the mask and dropped it on the floor . " Some of yours will do . " Graykin started to laugh , then saw that she was serious . " Wait here . " He jumped up and disappeared down the hall . In a few minutes he was back with an armful of clothing , including one undergarment for which Jame had no use whatsoever . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She put on the rest : soft black boots cross gartered from instep to knee ; black pants ; broad black belt ; loose black shirt ; even a pair of black gloves . " There , " said Graykin , surveying her . " The perfect outfit  --  for a sneak . " Jame raised an eyebrow at him . " As you say . Perfect . Graykin , will you take me to the temple ? " " As you say . . . lady . " He led her there by a tortuous route , full of unexpected twists and turns . Jame smiled . Clearly , he did n't want her to master the intricacies of the palace anymore than she would have welcomed a rival in the Maze back in Tai-tastigon . She fixed each turn in her well-trained memory . Then Graykin cautiously opened a door , and there stood the temple in its nine-sided chamber . Jame estimated that it was at least forty-eight hours since she had last been here . In that time , the light sphere suspended from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger . Worse , a continuousripple of power warped the air like heat over a sun-baked rock . Graykin stopped at the door . Jame went slowly up the temple as though making her way through treacherous currents . She called , but this time no voice answered from inside . The bar was still in place . If only it had been a lock , she could have mastered it , but this required at least Marc 's great strength . Dangerous , dangerous . . . . She backed to the door . " Graykin , you 'd better keep an eye on this place in case I do n't get back . At some point , the temple door will start to disintegrate . Then you and Lyra had better get out of the palace fast before it comes down on top of you . "  | " Yes , lady . " Graykin sounded impressed despite himself . " But where are you going ? " " You said my friends are n't in the palace . Could they have been taken out to where the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolted shut all the doors but one , and I 've been keeping an eye on that . " " Damn . As far as I know , then , that only leaves one place they could be : in the shadows . " They had left the temple room and were walking back into the heart of the palace . Suddenly Graykin caught Jame 's arm . Before them , the hallway dimmed and distorted , shadowy depth within depth . " That was n't here before , " said Graykin in a low voice . " The darkness is spreading . And you want to go into it ? " Jame wrapped her arms about her , shivering . " No . I do n't want to at all . " In fact , a small , cold voice seemed to whisper in her mind , it could be a terrible mistake . " But what choice do I have ? " Graykin regarded her with astonishment . " Why , you really do n't know what you 're doing , do you ? " " Very seldom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I did , I probably would n't be doing it , but as far as I can see , the alternative is to spend the rest of my life standing in a corner with a sack over my head . I 'm serious about Lyra , by the way . Watch out for her . She may be a cruel , stupid child , but she 's one of us . See you later  --  I hope . " She walked into the shadows.  |p199AT  DUSK on the fourteenth of Winter , the Kencyr Host came to the place where the road bends nearly due east following the curve of the river . That night , it camped beside the ancient paved way . At dawn on the fifteenth , it forded the Silver and marched south through the untrodden grass into the rolling , forbidden land . At this season , the hills were green and yellow rather than white , and the sky was a clear , eye-aching blue . Tall , coarse grass waved on the summits . Below , the hollows bristled with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less sharp of thorn . Laced through the barbed branches were white flowers , which looked quite pretty from a distance , but , at closer range , resembled tiny , deformed skulls . At dusk , a billion crickets sang and mist gathered in the hollows . The first night passed without incident . The second day they pushed on as quickly as the terrain permitted , but at sundown still found themselves uncomfortablyclose to the old battlefield . All day , they had been stumbling across bones in the high grass , missed by those who had searched the hills immediately after the fight . These they gathered , in case any of them were Kencyr , for a later pyre . That night , some told stories around the watchfires of the unburnt dead while others remembered the grief and shame of Ganth Gray Lord 's fall . Many of the older Kendar were survivors of that last bloody battle . All felt uneasy and unwilling to sleep , despite their exhaustion . Donkerri did sleep , but poorly . He dreamed that he againp200stood shivering by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disowned him . " I 'm not good at forgiving those who spy on me , " said Torisen . " Ask Burr . But I will try if you promise never to do it again . " But you never went bone hunting at Kithorn , " the other boys jeered at him . " Baby , baby , blood-blind , blood-blind , blood-blind ... " Donkerri woke with a gasp to the sound of the taunting chorus . But no , it was only the crickets . He hadn ' t been cast out , not utterly . Torisen had taken him in , and here he was now , safe in the Highlord 's tent . He still belonged somewhere and , somehow , he would still find a way to prove himself . Donkerri wrapped that thought around him and slept again , comforted . In his own tent , Lord Caineron was commiserating with would-be-lord Korey . No , it was n't right that the Highlord had put that blockhead Demoth in charge of the Coman . Once the family would never have accepted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of honor had fallen . Randir looked across at Caineron 's lighted pavilion and wondered with scorn what stupidity the man was up to now . All that power , in the hands of a fool . Brandan walked among his own people , exchanging a quiet word here , a tired smile there . For perhaps the hundredth time , he wondered what he was getting them all into , following this young , possibly mad Highlord of a broken house . The Edirr twins sat beside a brazier in their tent , discussing women and , as usual in private , finishing each other 's sentences . In his own richly appointed tent , Ardeth poured over his maps as if counting the leagues to the Cataracts over and over would somehow lessen the distance . Holly , Lord Danior , slept . To Torisen , restlessly walking the northern perimeter alone , came the boy Rion , almost in tears . " Lord , lord , come quick ! Great-great-grandpa Jedrak wants to see you . I-I think he 's dying . " The Jaran standard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern perimeter . Everyone had instinctively chosen the summits and upper slopes , leaving the lower reaches to the remount herd so that it might drift from slope to slope , grazing under the watchful eyes of the dozen or so Whinno-hir who had accompanied the Host . Torisenp201passed rapidly below the herd with Rion trotting beside him . Above , fires dotted the hillsides . Below , mist swelled up in the hollows . Then they were climbing again toward the watchfires through the silent , waiting ranks of the Jaran 's people . Torisen noted that many of them were rather old for military service , and then remembered that most of these Kendar , even the former randons , were scrollsmen and scrollswomen first , and warriors second . Kirien emerged from the main tent carrying a fine linen cloth , which he carefully spread on the ground under the Stricken Tree banner . A long sigh rose from the darkness . He drew a knife , nicked his thumb , and let a drop of blood fall on the center of the cloth . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his hand , producing a spray of blood , most of which he managed to get on the cloth 's center . He gave the blade to the nearest Kendar and burst into tears . " I 'm sorry , " Torisen said to Kirien . " I came as quickly as I could . " He followed the young man into the large tent 's innermost chamber . Jedrak lay on his pallet , his sharp profile visible through the cloth laid over his face . " Poor old man . He should never have come on an expeditionlike this . " " So we all told him . " Kirien covered the brazier near the old lord 's bed , letting the shadows enfold him . " He would have his way , though , always  --  except this one last time . " " Rion said he wanted to talk to me . Do you know what about ? " " Two things . First , he did n't want to mix his ashes with those already thick on these accursed hills . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the day after tomorrow at the latest . His pyre can wait until then . " " Good . Second . . . hush , Rion . What would Grandpa think of you , making a noise like that ? Here , lie down and try to sleep . There 's a good lad . " He came back into the light , leaving the boy curled up on his pallet in a corner , choking down sobs . Torisen stared at him . Something about his face , about the way he moved . . . " Have I finally lost my few remaining wits or are you a woman ? "  |p202Kirien  smiled . " Not quite . I do n't come of age for a few more years . " " Well , I 'll be damned . But how on earth have you kept it a secret all this time ? " " Who said it was a secret ? The Jaran have always known . As for the other houses , my mother died giving birth to me , you see . That made both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one outside our own house has paid much attention to either of us ever since , rather to our relief . Not that Jaran Highborn have ever been considered very good matches . Too eccentric , you know . Lord Randir condescended mightily in letting his niece contract to my father . Then she died . I could have been born a three-legged hermaphrodite for all my esteemedgrand-uncle Randir knew or cared . " " And now ? " She smiled . " I still could be , but since Jedrak declared me his heir ... " " Randir assumes you 're male . " He gave her a sharp look . " Was I supposed to confirm you , making the same assumption ? " " Of course not . Jedrak was going to tell you tonight . He wanted your promise before he died that you would support my claim . That was his second request . " Torisen turned away , running a hand distractedly through his hair . " Of all the crack-brained , senile whims , but even if I were to sanction such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jedrak must have known that . " Kirien gave him a cool , almost scornful look . " We are a house of scholars . Give us credit at least for having done our research . There 's nothing in the Law that prohibits a lady from heading a family instead of a lord . In the case of fraternal twins like the Master and the Mistress , the power even used to be shared . It 's only since Jamethiel Dream-Weaver fell that so many restrictions have been put on Highborn women , and most of them are pure Custom , not Law . " " But surely the male Highborn in your house will challenge your claim . " She snorted . " Which one of them would want to ? As I said , we 're scholars , each one of us wrapped up in his or her own work . My own speciality is the Fall . You might say that the entire house of Jaran flipped a coin for the post of administrator , and Ip203lost . Great-Uncle Kedan will officiate until I come of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on any longer . The question is : Will you confirm me when the time comes ? " Torisen considered this rather blankly . " I hardly know . Theidea will take some getting used to , and then things will depend a good deal on how much power I have when you finally come of age . The High Council is sure to raise a howl audible from here to the Cataracts . " He smiled suddenly . " It would almost be worth sponsoring you just to see the others ' faces . Trust the Jaran to come up with something so unconventional . " " Unconventional . " Kirien glanced back into the shadows toward the bed . When she looked back at Torisen , a tear glinted in her eye . " Jedrak always said that was what he liked best about you , too . " TORISEN PAUSED in the tent 's entrance to turn up his collar against the night 's chill . The Kendar were still silently paying their respects , a drop of blood each . The border of the mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood dried , the cloth would be folded and placed on Jedrak 's chest , to go with him into the flames . In the old days , the blood-bound followersof a Shanir lord would have slain themselves on his pyre . The rite might now be purely symbolic , but it was still a private ceremony in which the Highlord had no part . Torisen withdrew . The Jaran 's main tent was practically at the eastern-most point of the camp . Beyond were a few watchfires on the hilltop , then only the moonlit slopes rolling toward the distant Silver , toward the much nearer battlefield . Torisen walked out beyond the perimeter and sat down on the hillside , looking eastward over the diminishing swell of the hills . He thought about Kirien . The idea of a lady holding the power of a house still left him thoroughly non-plussed , but then he knew so little about Highborn women in general . Most were kept strictly sequestered and their contracts arranged solely on political lines . He had n't even met Kallystine before his agreement with her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so vicious . Would his lost twin sister have grown up into a woman like that ? He could n't imagine . All his life , he had felt haunted by Jame , but in a curiously abstract way , as if by a ghost without a face , without a voice . Only over the past year and ap204half had his sense of her presence sharpened , especially just before or after a nightmare , so that now sometimes he almost felt as if she were standing behind him . But who or what would he turn to find ? The wind teased his hair , breathed down his neck . Tori , I 've come back . I 'm coming to find you . Torieeeee .. He started violently , waking from a half-doze . This would never do . Last night , he had told himself that it was better to stay awake because any dream here would be particularly vile ; but now he suddenly wondered if another of those special nightmareslike the one at Tagmeth was creeping up on him . Usually , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severity of the dream . Surely it was too soon for another one . No , he must only be disturbed because of Jedrak 's death and because of where he was . Time to move on . As Torisen rose , however , his eyes stayed on the rolling land to the east , and he hesitated , puzzled . The shape of those distant hills looked so familiar , but how could that be ? He had never been here before . That hill there to the left , nearly out of sight ... beyond it should be one almost with a peak and beyond that another shaped like a barrow and beyond that .. . Bemused , Torisen walked down the slope away from camp , limping slightly , toward the beckoning land . KINDRIE HAD BEEN OFFERED space in one of the large inner chambers of Ardeth 's tent where the lord 's Highborn kinsmen slept , but instead he had chosen a tiny room on the edge of the pavilion . It was barely large enough for his pallet and had only one opening with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canvas for bad , but it was all his . After years in the acolytes ' dormitory , such privacy filled him with incredulous delight . On the first days of the march , he often lay awake far into the night just to savor it . When the Host 's pace quickened , however , sleep became more precious . Then , in the White Hills , it became almost impossible . On the second night , Kindrie was dozing uneasily in his canvas-walled cell . He was n't used to so much riding , and his bones ached with fatigue . Even half an hour of dwar sleep would have given his healer 's body a chance to recover itself , but everytime he slid down toward it , confused dreams woke himp205again with a start . Now it seemed to him that the hills had begun to swell beneath the tent , like the restless billows of the sea . Up , down , up ... no , it was n't the canvas floor that rocked him , but hands , bone white , bone thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he heard the faintest thread of a voice cry . Oh please , wake up ! He needs you ! " Who ? " Kindrie said out loud , half waking . " Who needs me ? " A watchfire had been kindled outside , and golden flickering light flooded into the cubicle through the gauze doorway . Shadowsmoved on the outer wall . Voices murmured in the night , but none spoke to him . He was alone . . . or was he ? On the rear wall of his tiny room was a shadow that had n't been there before , bending over the shadow of his own recumbent form . Kindrie regarded it bemusedly , convinced he was still asleep . It was very small and painfully thin . Ah , it must belong to the dead child whose bones the Highlord had taken from Kithorn and still carried with him in his saddlebag . Now , what could she want with him , even in a dream ? She tugged and tugged . His shadow started to get up . Kindrie threw back his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no intention of letting his shadow go anywhere without him . He rapidly pulled on some clothes and followed it out of the tent . It and the smaller , moon-cast shadow of the dead girl led him through the camp toward the eastern perimeter , keeping to the lower reaches of the slopes . Beyond the Jaran 's camp , he followed the shadows up to a hilltop . The hills rolled on eastward before him under a quarter moon , and up one of their slopes went something dark . Another shadow ? No . Someone clad all in black . Someone who limped slightly . Torisen . Kindrie caught his breath . His first , almost unconscious act of healing as a child had been the repair of his own weak eyes , but somehow the improved vision had never carried over into dreams . He could see the hills , the moon , that dark , receding figure all too clearly . This was no dream . He was awake , and that was the Highlord of the Kencyrath going alone , unprotected , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward the unburnt and possibly vengeful dead.  |p206TORISEN  knew these hills . Their curves , the texture of their grass and stones , everything spoke to him of a place and time he had thought safely behind him forever . Ahead , darkness rose like a wall , black on black , blotting out the stars . As a child , he had sometimes lain awake at night staring out the window at it , hardly daring to breathe lest it topple , crushing the keep , the Haunted Lands , all of Rathillien . Now here it was again : the Barrier , with Perimal Darkling pressing against its far side . One more rise and there , impossibly , was the keep itself , his old home , nine hundred miles away from the White Hills . He walked down the slope toward it in a kind of horrorstruckdaze . Here was the stone bridge that spanned the encirclingditch , here the main gate , hanging askew . Beyond the gatehouse lay the courtyard , surrounded by the stone barracks , granary , and other domestic offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roofs . Ahead rose the squat tower keep . He walked slowly toward it , still numb with disbelief . Grass grew between the flagstones , catching at his feet . Leech vines hung down over the walls . How quiet everything was , how . . . dead . Before the tower door was a black , tangled mass  --  the remains , apparently , of a bonfire . Now who would set one there ? Father would raise three kinds of hell when he . . . no , not charred branches , but arms , and legs , and faces .. Torisen recognized everyone that flame and sword had left recognizable : Lon , who had taught him how to ride ; Merri , the cook ; Tig , with all his battle scars scorched away . . . . He had dreamed of their deaths in that final assault over and over , but never of this . It 's still a dream , he thought , feeling the cold paralysis of nightmare creep over him . I fell asleep on the hillside , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lord ! " Footsteps sounded behind him . Hands turned him around . He looked dully into Kindrie 's face , barely focusing on it . " Go away . You do n't belong in this dream . " " Dream ? No , lord , listen to me : This is real . " " Real ? " Torisen blinked at him . " How can it be ? This is the keep where I grew up , where my father died cursing me . These are the Haunted Lands . "  |p207The  Shanir looked about , shivering . " Somehow , I did n't think we were still in the White Hills  --  although if we were , we 'd be just about in the middle of the old battlefield now . Correspondences . " He shot Torisen a look . " Why , do n't you see , the White Hills must have gone soft . Perimal Darkling is just under the surface there , as it obviously is here too , and when two contaminated areas are so similar in geography , architectureor  --  or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one were laid on top of the other . That must be how we got from there to here . " " ' We ' ? " Torisen turned on him , beginning to rouse . " Why did you follow me ? What do you want ? " Kindrie fell back a step , flinching . He 'd forgotten how much Torisen hated to be followed or spied on . " T-The child brought me , lord . See , here she is now . I-I think this place scares her . " The child 's shadow had moved between them on the moonwashedstones when the Highlord had turned . Now it came quickly to his side , so close that he unthinkingly reached down to touch the head that was n't there . Yes , she was frightened . This place must seem very like Kithorn to her . . . assuming both she and it were n't simply fancies of his sleep-locked mind . Abruptly , he dropped to one knee and slammed his fist into the pavement . Blood speckled the stones . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wonder at his broken knuckles . " It is real . Good . Then I can cope . Now , what in all the names of God happened here ? " Kindrie looked at him , surprised . " Why , I understood that darklings attacked here some fifteen years ago and killed everyonebut you . You escaped and came to the Riverland , where you took service in disguise under Lord Ardeth . At least , that 's the story people tell . " But then why had Ganth died cursing his son , the Shanir wondered suddenly . " That 's what people say , " Torisen agreed , not meeting Kindrie'sperturbed look . Of course , he had heard the story often enough before and never contradicted it . It was probably even true , except that the massacre had happened only a few years ago , long after he had fled . If anyone ever learned that he had left while Ganth was still alive , without his permission , the repercussions could be severe . " At any rate , this happenedp208later . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been here since I left . " " It looks like an attempt at a pyre , " Kindrie said . " These people were dragged here and set alight by someone  --  a Kencyr , I would say  --  who meant well but did n't know the proper pyric rune . Odd . " He peered more closely at the charred bodies , curiosity getting the better of repulsion . " They hardly look as if they 've been dead fifteen years . My God ! " He sprang backward , his face turning as white as his hair . " That woman 's hand . . . it moved ! " Torisen also backed away . " Haunts ... they 're all becominghaunts . Nothing stays dead forever in this foul place , not unless it 's reduced to ashes and blown away . The fire only set them back . But if they 're still here , maybe he is , too . " " My lord ? " " Stay here with the child . I 'll be back in a minute . " Torisen edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keep 's first-story entrance . Both sets of doors had been smashed open . He paused just inside the inner one , waiting for his eyes to adjust to the faint light that came in through two deeply recessed windows . Before him lay the circular great hall where the garrison had met to eat and hear justice dispensed or what had passed for justice in those last days before his flight fifteen years ago . " Traitors ! " Memory caught the echo of that shrieked word , saw the Kendar freeze , faces turned to the lord 's table . " You eat my bread and yet you conspire to betray me ! You , and you , and you  --  " " Father , no ! These men are my friends and loyal to our house . Everyone here is . " " To my house , perhaps , but to me ? No , no , they deceive you , boy , as they did me . But never again ! You three , in your hands are knives to cut your meat . Turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come away . You ca n't help them . " It was Anar , the scrollsman , tugging at his sleeve , pulling him out of the hall into the private dining chamber on the other side of the open hearth . From behind came the sound of somethingheavy falling , again and again . The Kendar had made the only choice that honor permitted . Anar quietly closed the door.  | " Your father 's quite mad , you know , " he whispered , and choked down a giggle . " Oh yes , so am I  --  sometimes . It 's this place , this foul , accursed place .... You 've got to get away , child , before he gets tired of killing your friends and turns on you . Oh yes , he will : The thought is already half in his mind . Who else can take away what little power he has left ? " " But Anar , Ganth is n't just my father : he 's Lord Knorth , the head of our house . He 'll never let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert him , that will be the death of my honor . " Anar shot a scared look at the door , then leaned close . " Child , there is a way ... " And he told him . If every Kendar in the house gave his or her consent , their will overbalanced that of their lord . Anar 's brother Ishtier had tried to gain his release this way , but the Kendar had n't consented . After all , he was their priest . They needed him . But Ishtier had left anyway , honorless , for the safety and comfort of Tai-tastigon far to the south . But the Kendar could see what was happening now . They would let Tori go , with their blessings . " But Anar , how can anything outweigh a lord 's author-ity ? " " Child , this can . . . I think . " He gulped . " And if it ca n't , I-I take responsibility for whatever you decide , on my honor . " The door to the hall crashed open . Ganth loomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? Talking behind my back , conspiring . . . " Torisen faced him . " Sir , we were only discussing honor  --  and options . " Now the hall lay silent and empty before him , lit only by moonlight streaming in between the bars of the two windows . Something rustled furtively in the shadows by the door . Torisen did n't investigate . Quickly crossing the hall to the spiral stair just off the private dining room , he climbed in utter darkness to the second floor , his feet remembering the height of each irregular step . Here were the family 's living quarters , a maze of interconnectedrooms circling the lord 's solar over the great hall . Some moonlight filtered into the outer rooms through slit windows . The inner ones lay buried in shadows too deep even for ap210Kencyr 's keen night vision , and not all of them were vacant . These Torisen passed through quickly , seeing nothing , hearing nothing , but knowing that he was not alone . Beyond , the stair in the northwest turret began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlements seemed dazzlinglybright . The cracked crystal dome over the solar shone like a second moon , and the white gravel roof gave back its glow . In the shadow of the northeast turret , Ganth Gray Lord waited . Torisen stopped , catching his breath . " Father ? " No answer . How still that grim figure stood , the dead piled high about him like half-burnt kindling . Torisen slowly crossed the roof toward him , poised to fight or run , he hardly knew which . Those shadows on Ganth 's chest .... He was nailed upright to the turret door by three arrows . The ring finger on the right hand had been snapped off . Of the left hand , which had wielded Kin-Slayer , not one finger was left . Both ring and sword were gone . The corner of something white protruded from the gray coat just above the singe-line of the pyre 's flames . Torisen stepped gingerly in among the dead and reached for it . His father 's head moved . He snatched the folded cloth and leaped backward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the grip , and fetched up against the crystal dome . Ganth was staring down at him , without eyes . " Child of darkness .. .. " The words were harsh , croaking , spoken in a voice that both was and was not his father 's . " Where is my sword ? Where are my fingers ? " Torisen bolted toward the northwest turret . Behind him , the dead around Ganth 's feet were moving , slowly , unsteadily , disentangling charred arms and legs . He nearly fell down the spiral stair . At its foot , rustling , scraping sounds came to him from the darkness ahead . All the dead were awakening . A trap , he thought wildly , I 've walked into a trap ... Steady , boy , steady . One , two ... " three ! " He sprinted through the second-story rooms , twisting , turning , into moonlight , into darkness . Here was the stair . He halfthrewhimself down it and raced across the great hall . A dark shape lurched into his path from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but tripped over a shattered bench and fell heavily . Someone bent over him.  |p211.  . wrong . . . " croaked a familiar voice . " I was wrong . . . . Nothing outweighs a lord 's authority . Take back the responsibility , child . It burns me . . . it burns ... " Torisen stared up horrified into Anar 's face . The failed pyre had seared it hideously , laying bare cheekbones and patches of skull . He gave an inarticulate cry , shoved the haunt aside , scrambled to his feet , and bolted out the door . The other 's brokenvoice pursued him : " Child , set me free . . . free us all . . . Kindrie had backed into the middle of the inner ward , away from the pyre , away from the stone barracks now alive with furtive sounds . Torisen grabbed him . " The rune , man , the pyric rune . . . can you say it ? " The Shanir stared at him , terrified . " I-I do n't know .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of half-burned bodies bythe door had begun to seethe sluggishly . Torisen shook him . " Say it , damn you ! Set them free ! " The pale young man gulped and shut his eyes . Torisen very nearly slapped him , thinking he was about to faint , but instead Kindrie took a deep breath and spoke the rune . It fought its way out of his throat like a living thing , and he fell , gagging . Torisen caught him . The mound of twitching bodies burst into flames . Sudden firelight lit the inside of the barracks , and the keep 's great hall , roared up above the tower 's battlements . Torisen half dragged Kindrie out under the gatehouse and across the stone bridge . On the hillside , he finally let the exhausted Shanir sink down into the tall grass , while he himself stood , breathing hard , watching his old home go up in flames . Fifteen years ago , he had paused on this same hillside to look back before slipping away southward into the night . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later . Then the Three People would be without him now , when they needed him the most . But he had left poor Anar to bear his guilt , and that was a shameful thing , however good his reasons . Perhapshis honor was safe in the letter of the Law , but he felt compromised in its spirit and sick at heart . Torisen shook himself . These thoughts did no one any good except , perhaps , his enemies . Surely , this whole thing had been a trap , but set by whom and , ultimately , for whom ? Only the changers , with their affinity to Perimal Darkling and their deter/mination to stop him , could be responsible . First , there had been the Shanir 's attack at Tentir , then Grisharki 's crude but nearly lethal ambush , then the carefully preserved , barely hidden post pouch . Any Kencyr would know what effect that desperate messagewould have . Of course , the Host would make for the Cataractsat top speed , by the most direct route . Then came an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Haunted Lands those distant White Hills had suddenly become , much less go out to investigate . But he had , and there had been the keep waiting for him , a festering sore ready to burst . Perhaps his very presence had triggered that eruption . Perhaps the changers had counted on that . Below , red light spilled out of the tower 's door and down the steps into the courtyard . More light and then flames poured out of the south window between the bars . The hall must be an inferno by now . The pyric rune only affected dead flesh , but flesh in turn could kindle wood . How many dead there must have been . Flames , fire , fire-timbers , Tentir .. . " Now , what would really frighten you , I wonder ? Shall we find out ? " " Child of Darkness ! Where is my sword ? Where are my Yes , he had been frightened to hear that dead mouth repeat the words of his nightmare , but not half as scared as the real thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could have taken them ? Then he remembered the cloth that he had snatched from inside Ganth 's coat . It was still in his hand . He unfolded it . It was n't a proper mourning cloth at all , just a square of fabric ripped out of someone 's shirt . In the exact center was one dark stain , the mark of blood kinship . But he was the only surviving member of Ganth 's immediate family unless . . . unless .. . Jame , the Shanir , the Child of Darkness , his sister  --  she had returned . For a moment , all Torisen felt was numb shock . Then he abruptly sat down on the hillside and began to laugh , helplessly , almost hysterically . " My lord ? " It was Kindrie , sounding scared . " No , no , I have n't lost my wits  --  I hope . The fools ! All that work , and they set their trap for the wrong twin ! " He chokedp213down his laughter . " We 've got to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ? " " Walk , I suppose . " " More than three hundred leagues ? " " Less , I hope , " said Kindrie hastily , as if afraid Torisen would start laughing again . " After all , the child could n't get that far from her physical remains . We 've got to follow her back and keep exactly to the path she marks , or I 'm afraid it will be a very long walk indeed . " " Yes . . . yes , of course . " Torisen rose and followed the child 's shadow as it danced ahead of them . He was still struggling to regain his mental balanceand , he suspected , not doing a very good job of it . He knew he had frightened the Shanir badly . Kindrie was still keeping his distance from him , as if from something dangerous and unpredictable , which was just how Torisen felt . He turned suddenly on the young man , who shied violently away . " Just now , you sounded rather strange . Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rune burned my tongue a bit . I 'll heal . " " You always do , do n't you ? " Even to Torisen , that sounded like a sneer . Trinity , what was wrong with him ? Kindrie took the question seriously . " So far , lord , yes . I may not be strong , but I 'm apparently tougher than I look  --  a family trait . My grandmother was a Knorth , you know . " He shot a sidelong look at Torisen . " I know that that does n't give me much claim on the house of Knorth , but some pride does go with it . You should n't have sent me away with Donkerri at Wyrden . " " God 's teeth and toenails ! I saw what Caineron did to you back at Tentir because of me . D' you think I wanted to put you in danger again ? But now I have anyway , and you 've put me under a deeper obligation than ever . " He spoke with such bitterness that Kindrie flinched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . It 's true that you are my natural lord . I ca n't help that ; you ca n't change it . But if you do n't want to acknowledge my claim , I-I 'd rather that it was forgotten . " " Very noble , but that hardly discharges the obligation , does it ? For someone who says he only wants what I can freely give , you certainly keep finding ways to put me in your debt . "  |p214He  turned on his heel and went on after the child 's shadow , limping a bit more than before , leaving Kindrie to flounder after him . Damn and blast . For years , he had avoided the Shanir and lulled himself into thinking that he had gotten over his irrational aversion to them . Now here he was , deeply obligated to one and paying him back with words savage enough to have come from his mad father . Ganth was glowing ashes behind him . Why in Perimal 's name did his shadow still fall across his son 's life ? Kindrie gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanir sprawling on the ground behind him at the edge of a mist-filled hollow . In trying to catch up , he had cut too close to the hidden ground and apparently tripped on something . Mist swelled up around his legs . He could n't seem to rise . " Oh , for God 's sake , " Torisen said in disgust and went back to help . " My foot ! " the young man gasped as Torisen grabbed his arms . " Something has a hold on my foot ... ah ! " He was jerked back , almost out of the Highlord 's grip . Torisen braced himself and heaved , nearly freeing the Shanir . A hand rose out of the mist . Its skin hung about it like a tattered glove , exposing white sinews and a flash of whiter bone . It was clutching Kindrie 's ankle . Kindrie gave a bleat of terror . Then both Kencyr fell , as the hand suddenly released its grip and a dark figure surged up out of the mist . Kindrie sprawled across Torisen 's legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , barely in time . The thing from the mist blotted out the stars . It fell on him , its cruel fingers fumbling for his eyes , his throat . It stank of death . Somehow he managed to brace his foot against it and flip it over his head . It landed heavily . He went after it before it could recover , caught it in a headlock and , with a quick , lateral twist , broke its neck . It convulsed , throwing him . He rolled nearly into the mist before coming up short in a fighter 's crouch . Clearly , however , the brief battle was over . " That should at least slow it down some , " he said unsteadily , and drew a sleeve across his face . The cloth stank from the creature 's touch . Kindrie stared at the twitching body . " B-but it 's still alive ! " " Moving , yes ; alive , no . You ca n't kill something that 's alreadydead. "  | " It 's another haunt ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt them occasionally when I was a boy . More often , they hunted me . " His head snapped up . " Listen ! " Far away over the hills , a horn sounded , and another and another . Torisen sprang up . " The camp  --  it 's under attack ! " He raced off toward the sound with Kindrie stumbling after him . Ahead , clouds rolling out of the west cloaked the sky , and distant thunder rumbled . Mist was swelling up even more thickly in the hollows , sending tendrils snaking up the lower slopes . The hills were becoming islands in a dim white sea . The fires of the Jaran 's camp crowned the next rise . Torisen scrambledup the steep slope toward them . Suddenly , dark shapes emerged from the grass all round , ringing him with spearpoints . " Here now , watch that ! " he snapped , pulling up short . " This one talks , " said a voice from the shadows . " Maybe it will tell us what it is . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There certainly is a resemblance , " said another voice . " Perhaps it 's a changer , or maybe an ' uman . Remember , there 's a reference in the fourth canto of the Randirean saga to one who changed into a bat . " " No , no  --  that was only in the aberrant version . . " Kirien , help ! " " What in Perimal 's name ... " said Kirien 's voice from above . " Luran , why are you holding the Highlord at spear point ? " " Oh . Sorry , my lord . " The spears swung around to cover Kindrie as he staggered up the slope . Torisen knocked them down . " Sorry . That 's not an ' uman either  --  whatever that is . I 've never been the subject of an academic debate before , " he said to Kirien as he joined her on the hilltop . " It 's a singularly unnerving experience . Now , what in all the names of God is going on ? " " Confusion , primarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these horses doing up here ? You must be playing host to at least a quarter of the remount herd . " " Under the circumstances , we can hardly begrudge themp216the room . About ten minutes ago , the lot came stampeding up the hill . Then our guards on the lower slopes shouted up that they were under attack . They were gone by the time we got there  --  yes , completely . Then these .. these things started coming up out of the mist . There ! Do you see that ? " It was hard to see anything below now that clouds had swallowed the moon . Beyond the circle of fires , beyond the Kendars ' double shield-wall , Torisen could just make out a horde of dark figures swarming up the lower slopes . They coalesced into a silent wave that beat and tore at the wall of shields with voracious hands and ignored the bite of spear and sword . The wall swayed but held . As the moon broke free for a moment from the advancing stormclouds , the wave receded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . From off to the south came a battle cry , rising , falling . " That 's the Coman , " said Torisen sharply . " What 's that idiot Demoth up to now ? " " Whatever it is , he tried it after the first assault , too . " " Ho , Kirien ! " The shout came from the next hilltop , which the Jaran also held . " Are you still there ? " " That 's my great-uncle . Ho , Kedan ! Where else would I be ? Your shield-wall held ? " " Of course . But darnnit , how can we fight what we ca n't even name ? War with the What's-it '  --  ha ! " " Not ha , ' " Torisen shouted across at him . " Haunts ! " " Ancestors preserve us , " said Kirien softly . " Our own unburntdead from the White Hills .. . " " Perhaps , perhaps not . " Someday , he might tell her about the Haunted Lands , the other possibility , but not tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill them , we ca n't even wear them down . Have we lost already ? " " No . " There had to be a way . The pyric rune would ignite every piece of carrion within half a mile , but Kindrie clearly had n't the strength to speak it again , and the idea apparently had n't even occurred to the other priests , wherever they were . But did they really need the rune ? " Fire , " he said to Kirien . " Get torches . " Below , the double row of Jaran Kendar waited . Singer Ashe limped restlessly back and forth behind the second line . Byp217rights , she should n't have been even that close because of her maimed leg , but the battle horns had reminded her that before an axe cut her military career short , she had been a randon , one of the elite . She wondered where Ham was . In their days together , first as cadets and then as one-hundred commanders , she had always covered his back , knowing that he forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to manage Harn Grip-Hard , she had always maintained , was to give him a good clout on the head before any major battle . Anything to slow the man down a bit . Then the moon again disappeared , this time for good . The shadow of the storm rack rolled eastward over the hills , dipping , swelling over hollow and crest . Darkness came in its wake , and the nearing rumble of thunder . The front line tensed . " Here they come again ! " The wall closed , shields locking with a crash . The Kendar leaned into them against the mute fury of the assault . Nails scraped on steel . Hands groped over the top of the shield-wall , clutching at heads and hair . The second line of Kendar opened ranks to slash at them . Their shields were still down when a wave of haunts broke over the first line , swarming on top of each other , rolling over the Kendar . Ashe saw them coming . " ' Ware their teeth ! " she cried , and limped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A haunt crashed into her . The impact knocked the staff from her hands and her off her feet . Bodies piled on top of her . Their stench , their loathsome touch  --  it was like being at the bottom of a mass grave , but all the corpses moved . Sharp nails tore at her clothes . Teeth locked in her arm , which she had thrown up to protect her throat . They were all fighting to get at her . Then light exploded between the chinks of bodies . A great hissing arose , and the limbs about her thrashed wildly , trying to disentangle themselves . She caught a knee in the stomach and was still doubled up , gasping for breath , when the mound of haunts above her broke apart . " Harry them home , but stay out of the mist ! " shouted a familiar voice over Ashe 's head . Hands pulled her up . " Well , singer , how goes the song ? " " Highlord ? "  |p218She  blinked at him with fire dazzled eyes . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair melting back into the night . Torches blazed everywhere , and everywherethe haunts were in retreat . " The song ? " Ashe repeated . " At least this time it wo n't be a dirge . " " Oh well . The night is n't over yet . You stay clear from now on , though , and have a physician look at that arm . Remember , you 're the one who 's going to immortalize us all . " " Lord ! " The hail came from downhill . " My lord , the mist ! " Torisen spun around and plunged off down the slope . Ashe sat down heavily . " My arm ... ? " She looked in dullwonder at the shredded , bloody sleeve . Below , Kendars ringed the hollow , staring at it . They made way for Torisen . Ground fog still seethed in the depression , but now it seemed to be lit from within , its shifting surface fitfully aglow . " Lord , is it on fire ? " " I do n't think so . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could all trace the arabesque of stem and skullshapedflower etched in fire under the white surface of the mist . The mist began to melt away in the growing heat , leaving behindonly ashes and hard-packed earth . The door between the White Hills and the Haunted Lands had closed . In a nearby camp , a horn sounded , then another and another , signaling the end of battle . Now it was time to count the cost . Torisen walked alone through the camp , hollow by hollow . Either his cry for torches had carried or others had come up with the same solution , for every depression had recently been fired , and some were still smoldering . Apparently no encampmenthad been overrun . Most were now clearing the hilltops and taking down any standards that might attract the lightning flickering closer and closer in the black bellies of the stormclouds . As he passed under Lord Danior 's camp , Holly came down to meet him . " Only three guards killed and two missing , " he said proudly . " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people got a bit mauled , though . " " Keep an eye on them . Haunt bites infect easily and makep219haunts of their victims after death . There 's the Coman standard , still up . Now what . . . oh my God . " Ahead lay another smoking hollow , surrounded this time by a four-foot bank . In its midst , rising out of the very earth as if to clutch brambles now reduced to ashes , was a hand . " Why , someone 's been buried alive ! " Holly exclaimed . He jumped down into the hollow before Torisen could stop him and grabbed the hand . It came away in his grasp . There was no arm attached to it , no sign of a body on or beneath the ashes . The earth itself seemed to have sheared it off . On the lower slopes were many more bodies , some still twitching , others all too still . Many had been gnawed almost beyond recognition . Korey stood among them , rigid with fury , facing Demoth . The upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no right ! " That was Demoth , nearly shrieking . " I lead the Coman ! I order attack or retreat , or anything else I damn well please ! You 're nothing , do you understand ? Nothing ! " " What 's happened here ? " They both spun at the sound of Torisen 's voice . " He ordered my people back ! " raged Demoth . " He fired the hollow , against my express orders ! " " And he sent Kendar down into the mist to fight . Three times . " " Sweet Trinity . How many lost ? " " Over a hundred , and as many killed on the slopes , " Korey said angrily . " This is as much your doing as his , Highlord . You insulted the honor of the Coman by appointing this ... this bungler . You insulted me . " He drew a knife . ' Torisen had turned to Demoth . " I was wrong , and your kinsmen were right : You are n't fit to lead . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderstruckexpression . He put his hands on the young man 's shoulders . The knife point pricked him through his coat , just under the ribs . " Korey , you idiot , put that away . I 've just given you the Coman . " " Blackie ! " Torisen heard Ham 's shout and saw Korey 's bewilderedp220gaze shift to something behind him . A footstep , the hiss of descendingsteel , and Korey shoved him aside . His sore leg failed him . He was already falling when knife and sword met with a crash , inches from his face . The violence of his swing had unbalanceADem.oth . He stumbled into Korey , and both fell , catching up Torisen as they rolled down the slope . For a moment , all three were over the bank , in midair . Then they crashed to the floor of the depression , with Torisen underneath . He landed on a rather large rock . Demoth lurched to his feet , still gripping his sword . " The Coman is mine ! You ca n't take it away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill ... " He took a shambling step and pitched forward at Torisen 's feet . Korey 's knife jutted out of his back . Ham skidded down the bank . " Blackie , are you all right ? From where I stood , it looked as if that bastard nearly took your head off ! " He helped the Highlord sit up . Torisen was breathing in great , painful gasps . " Grindarks .. . haunts .. homicidal Highborn . and I do myself in . . . on a damned rock ! " " Ho , that 's it , is it ? Serves you right if you 've broken half your ribs . Of all stupidities , to turn your back on an angry Coman . Trinity ! Here comes Ardeth . " " Ardeth ... " Torisen dragged himself to his feet , hanging on to Harn . " I 've just killed your cousin , or maybe Korey has . As maternal blood-kin , what blood price do you demand ? " Ardeth stood on the edge of the bank , looking down . Torchlightturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face in shadow . " What price ? " he repeated numbly , then straightened . " Why , none , my boy . I saw everything . It probably was an accident . " " And you ? " Torisen turned to Demoth 's paternal kinsmen on the slope . " None , my lord . " " Ancestors be praised . A simple solution for once . All right , everyone settle in for what 's left of the night and sleep if you can . The hills should be quiet enough for the time being . By tomorrow night we 'll be out of them and able to honor our deadp221fittingly . None are to stay here . Understood ? Then pass the word . " He turned and found himself face to face with a truculent Korey . " You have n't bought me , you know . I 'll never crawl for you the way that worm Demoth would have . " " I was n't expecting it . Just act for the good of your house ; and as for owing me anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be furious with you . " " So Blackie 's luck ' is still a proverb , " said Ham as he , Torisen , and Ardeth walked back toward the Knorth encampmentwith several members of Ardeth 's war-guard following at a tactful distance . " I always thought you were too lucky for your own good . " " Never mind him , " said Torisen to Ardeth . " Eventually , he 'll forgive me for not having gotten myself killed . Just the same , Ashe was wrong : The song was a dirge . " Harn snorted . " There could be sadder ones . . . your pardon , my lord . " " No , no , " said Ardeth absently . " You 're perfectly right . Demoth turned out to be somewhat less than satisfactory . Now , if I can just arrange a contract between Korey and one of my great grandnieces ... " At his own campsite , the old Highborn left them . Torisen looked after him with a wry smile . " I 'm beginning to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal to be made out of it . " " And when he finds out about Pereden 's role in the SouthernHost 's destruction ? " " I do n't know . The best we can hope , I suppose , is that the wretched boy died honorably . We 've got to salvage Pereden 's reputation if we can , for his father 's sake . " Harn stopped short . " Not if it means maligning his officers . " The Highlord turned and stared at him . " Sweet Trinity . Those Kendar were my officers too once , and the only family I knew for nearly half my life . D' you really think I would turn on them now ? " The stiffness went slowly out of Ham 's shoulders . " Well , no  --  of course not . Damn stupid thing to say , really .. "  | " And if you say anything more , it will be even stupider . What the  --  " A small figure hurled down the hill from the Knorth camp and threw its arms around Torisen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Donkerri , all right . I 'm glad to see you , too . Just mind the ribs . " Burr came down the slope at a more sedate pace . " We just heard about the fight and Lord Coman 's death . Are you all right , my lord ? " " Ribs , " Harn repeated sharply . " Here now , why did n't you say you 'd really been hurt ? " " Oh , I do n't think anything 's broken . Cracked a bit , maybe ... " With that , they closed in on Torisen and bore him off , a protesting captive , to his own tent . THE RAINS CAME , pelting the hills , running down in rivulets between the tents , pooling in the hollows . Lightning ripped , thunder boomed . Torisen lay on his pallet listening to the storm , watching the tent 's framework stand out in black relief around him with each flash of light . Although his leg felt sore and cramped , he resisted the temptation to stretch it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bones nestledin the curve of his arm . His side ached too , but he was fairly sure now that it was only bruised . As Ham would say , Blackie 's luckstill held . . . but for how long ? What if , as he half suspected , his sister Jame really was on her way to him ? With the emblems of my power in her hands , boy . Yes . Torisen was virtually certain that she had taken Ganth 's ring and sword . But what of that ? She could n't wield them . She was only a girl . So is Kane " Nothing in the Law prohibits a lady fromheading a family instead of a lord . " And she has power of her own , boy . Why do you think I named her " Jamethiel ' ? But she was his sister . And your Shanir twin , your darker half Why do you think I drove her out , boy ? Now she returns , to rival , to destroy you . But h-he loved her . He always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the distance unnoticed . Torisen lay in the dark , listening to the hoarse , mad voice that was both his dead father 's and , somehow , his own , muttering on and on long after he had run out of ways to answer it.  |p225JAME  ENTERED the shadows ofKarkinaroth warily . At first , though , that was all they seemed to be , just an obscurity lying over the rich features of the palace , dulling the crimson carpet , turning the purple and gold hangingsgray . The light spheres burned more and more dimly . Betweenthem , the details of the palace seemed to fade , or rather almost to melt . New depths opened up in the shadows , reaching back to distant walls . Between the circles of light , the coldness of the floor struck through Jame 's thin boots . Here was pavement that had never known the touch of a carpet . Now the light spheres were only faint glows bobbing in midair . A few hints of the palace 's architecture hung ghostlike about them , but that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jame went on , shivering slightly in this colder air . Outside windowless Karkinaroth there had been the warm , southern land of Karkinor . What lay beyond these walls . . . and what was that smell ? It surrounded her now , vaguely sweet , vaguely rotten , like the faded perfume of decay . The very walls seemed to exude it . How frighteningly familiar it was , and how dull of her not to recognize it . A doorway opened between the phantom light of two spheres . Jame almost went past it , thinking it was some strange tapestry woven of shadows , but a breath of air came out of it . She entered . Her memory told her that if she had continued down the hallway in Karkinaroth and turned at this door , she would have found herself in the palace 's main ballroom . This too was ap226room , but an even more enormous one . Jame walked out into it . Her soft boots made no sound on the dark , green-shot floor , woke no echoes in the impossibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank upon rank of memorial banners . In a normal Kencyr hall , these traditionally were tapestry portraits of the Highborn dead , woven of threads taken from the clothes in which each man or woman had died . Usually , the faces were calm and the hands held low and open , crossed at the wrists in benediction . But the faces on these banners grimaced hideously . Their hands clutched tattered clothing . Dark stains as if of dried blood streaked the walls beneath . Jame looked about with growing horror . Surely this was the big picture-lined hall that her mother had described to her allthose years ago ; but the pictures were portraits of the dead , and they all looked so starved because . . . because the souls had been eaten out of them . But how could she know that ? Then , too , there were so many of them . Too many ? Why in Perimal 's name should she think that ? She had never actually been in this hall before  --  or had she ? At the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several trees piled in it . Fur rugs covered the cold hearth . More complete rugs with snarling masks , were nailed to the wall above . They were all pelts of Arrin-ken . Her mother had n't told her that , but she had remembered it in the dream that had first awakened her in Karkinaroth . Surely , she knew more about this place than any story could have told her . She had stood here before in her dreams , in the flesh . This was the great hall of the Master 's House , where her father 's cruelty had driven her so many years ago , where she had spent her forgotten childhood . She was in Perimal Darkling . Jame turned to bolt , but the door by which she had entered was gone . She was trapped . Jame stood in the middle of that vast hall under the eyes of the dead and began to shake . Far too many memories were pressing against that wall in her mind . If they all broke throughat once , if suddenly she remembered everything .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let through only what will help . You 've bumbled through most of your life in stark , staring ignorance . Do n't stop now . She took a deep breath andp227let it out slowly . All right . Now stop shaking and go find your friends. .. and the sword and the ring and the Book and the Prince .. . Trinity , was everyone and everything lost but her , or was she the most lost of them all ? Do n't answer that . Just go . Jame went  --  across the hall , through an archway , into the depths of the House . As the Talisman , she had learned how to move like a shadow among shadows , and so she did now , every sense alert , every nerve taut . Everything was so big , so empty . High-vaulted passageways , broad stone stairs spiraling up or down , more corridors , more halls . Everywhere , cold stone and colder shadows . But where was everyone ? Dead , said a familiar voice as if in her ear . They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . No one . It must have been her imagination . Forget it . Now , where might a prisoner be held ? Not one of the archwaysshe had passed so far had even been hung with a door . A cold , thin wind breathed unhindered through the twisting ways . Something kept Jame from calling . The place seemed deserted , but who ( or what ) might hear ? Jame went on . There was a sort of horrible fascination about this , as if at any minute her forgotten past might spring at her from some dark corner . A terrified , outcast child had come to this place and emerged the person she was now . Someone had taught her the meaning of honor ; someone had taught her how to reap souls . Thanks to those lost years , she was a paradox , a creature of both light and darkness . And Master Gerridon , what of him ? Before his fall , the long retreat from Perimal Darkling had been bitter , but at least endurablefor it had been done with honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his evil felt tainted by it . And that evil still existed . . . did n't it ? Marc had seen at least three score of the Master 's folk three years ago when they had swept down on East Kenshold from the smoking ruins of her own old home , still looking for her and the Book . In fact , Marc had even seen Gerridon himself , sitting his black horse on a hilltop , watchingEast Kenshold 's sack . His face would have been in shadows , Jame thought , and his upright form shrouded in a patchwork cloak of stolen souls . Onep228gauntleted hand , the right , would have gripped the reins while the other , mere emptiness in a silver glove , rested on the stallion'sebony neck . That left hand when it was still flesh and blood , reaching out to her between the red ribbons of a curtained bed . . . . " So you 've lost a father , child , " a soft voice said . " I will be another one to you and much , much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind panic , she slashed at it again and again un-tilNo . Jame leaned against a wall , shaking . She would n't remember that . She would n't . But what if the only way to find Marc and Jorin was to open her mind fully to the past ? She might once have known where prisoners were held . Did she dare take the risk ? And why was she so sure that it was a risk ? Something here was already tuggingat her . She did n't feel as frightened as she had at first , or as repulsed . Even that pervasive smell of decay was losing its disagreeabletang . Once this place had been home . Once she had been accepted here as , perhaps , she never would be anywhere else . But it could never be home again . Remember that , she told herself with sudden anger . And remember what terrible things have happened here . Remember where you are . Prisoners . . . something about a cage without bars , but what had that been , and where ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed herself away from the wall and went on , deeper into the House . All her senses , all her thoughts began to lose their edges . She drifted , feeling half asleep , dimly wishing after a time that she could sleep or at least find something to drink . Her mouth felt full of dust . How long had she been walking anyway ? It felt like days . She began to have a vague feeling that the rooms through which she wandered were n't entirely unoccupied after all . Dim light and shadow became silent figures standing ghostlikein this corner or that . Their empty eyes followed her . Perhapsto them she was the ghost . The wind blew in her face . She had been following it for some time without realizing it , but now its strength and the curious smell borne on it half roused her . She was facing an archway , its upper curve shaped like a mouth . Once it had beenp229walled up . Now massive blocks lay tumbled about it like broken teeth , and the wind blew through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something alive , many things in between .... The light in the room beyond was strange too , a sort of shifting green . Jame stepped between the blocks , through the archway . The light came from a window , the first she had seen in this place . The window was barred . Vines curtainedit with leaves and white flowers , shaped like bloodless , pouting lips , with glimpses between them of a sickly yellow sky . Barred windows , unearthly landscapes .. , this was like that step-back room in the Anarchies . Jame hugged herself , shivering . Old songs claimed that the Master 's House stretched back down the Chain of Creation from threshold world to world . Until Gerridon 's fall , the Kencyrath had even used the House itself as an escape route during their long retreat , sealing off each section , each world , behind them when they could no longer hold it . Nothing could have shatteredthose seals from the far side . Nothing had . It had taken a Kencyr 's treachery to break down the barriers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House where shadows crawled and changers were made . This was clearly not a good place to be . Jame backed toward the archway . From the window came a low sigh , as if from many throats . Something white shot past Jame 's face , trailing green . The vine wrapped itself around her neck . Another caught her arm , and another and another . They jerked her a step back toward the window . She clawed at those around her neck , but they only tightened . The white flower lips sighed in her ear , nuzzled against her throat . They began to turn pink , then red . Blood thundered in her ears . Vaguely , she felt the iron bars press against her back , felt the strength go out of her legs . Then someone was beside her . A knife flashed  --  4 was all white , hilt and blade , she noted in a dazed way and the red lips fell away with a whispered shriek . Leaves rained down , already withered . She was on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a face as emaciated as any on the death banners in the Master 's hall . Shouts . The man jumped up and darted away , deeper into the House.  | " Terribend , you fool , wait ! You three guards , after hirn ! " Retreating footsteps , running . Someone else bent over her now . Fair hair , a young face , silver-gray eyes , . . " Prince Odalian ? " He smiled . " Close enough . You had gotten yourself into a mess , had n't you ? Some things never seem to change . Let 's see . " He tilted her chin one way , then the other . " Not much damage , luckily , although you 've probably lost a fair amount of blood . Can you stand ? " She tried and lurched into his arms . " Damn . " " Never mind . " He picked her up . She was surprised at such strength in one so slight . " Size is n't everything , " he said , just as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know that . Hang on . " He carried her through the archway back into the gray halls . From his swift , sure stride , it was clear that he knew exactly where he was going . " Prince , what did you call that man ? " He went on a few paces without answering . Then , " Bender is one of his names . It will do . " She could have sworn that Odalian had called the fugitive Terribend , but that was the name of Tirandy 's brother , the one who had disappeared from song and history at the time of the Fall . Bender ? That sounded familiar too , but she could n't quite place it . If only her head would stop spinning .. . The Prince put her down on a bed . She looked around in amazement at the apartment 's rich furnishings . Had he taken her back into the palace , or was this some oasis among the House 's bleak rooms ? She guessed the latter . White wine splashed into a crystal cup . Odalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass . Then he brought it over to the bedand thrust it almost roughly into Jame 's hands . " Here . " She drank thirstily , noting without really paying attention that it had the same unfamiliar after taste as the wine she had drunk earlier , only this time the tang was much sharper . Her head swam alarmingly . " Wine on an empty stomach , " he said , sitting down on the edge of the bed and taking the cup from her . " I do n't supposep231you remembered to pack any provisions for this mad expedition of yours . No , of course not . You never did take a sensible interest in food . " She stared at him . The way he spoke , the way he moved , both were so very familiar and yet surely she had never met the Prince before . She had only known what he looked like because of Lyra 's clumsy portrait , and that had barely suggested anythingbeyond his general coloration . Wait a minute .. . " Odalian 's eyes are brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him . " Yours are gray , like mine . Who are you ? " Those steady gray eyes regarded her as if through a mask that was Odalian 's face . " You do n't remember me . Good . But you 've probably at least guessed what I am . " She nodded , her throat suddenly dry despite the wine . " You 're another changer . What have you done to the Prince ? " " I ? " He gave a sudden harsh laugh . " Personally , very little . I came to see him the night he sent his message to the Kencyr High Council asking for help . He thought I was Torisen . We can approximate virtually any form , you know , until the shadows get too much of a grip on us , as they have on Keral , whose acquaintanceI believe you renewed in the Ebonbane . At any rate , I told the Prince that I had decided to confirm him as a full ally of the Kencyrath before our forces met . He was pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pact by blood rites . Once I had tasted his blood willingly given , I was able to take his form . " " But not exactly . " " No , not quite . The eyes have always given me trouble . It takes many rebirths in the farthest rooms of the House to make one . . . er . . . malleable enough to get all the details correct , even with the full blood rites . " " But too many rebirths result in something like Keral , who can no longer hold any true shape , " said Jame , trying to sound defiant . " It seems to me that you changers have a pretty limited usefulness . " " Oh , yes . Our prime only lasts a millennia or so , by Rathillienstandards . Good endures , I 'm told . Well , perhaps . But I know from experience that evil eventually decays , as my lord Gerridon is beginning to learn . But we were discussing Princep232Odalian . He was understandably surprised to find himself face to face with even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a moment later he was taken in charge by three of his own suborned guards . Then I opened the barriers between Karkinaroth and the Master 's House , and they took him into the farthest rooms . There they left him , chained . " Jame shuddered . " My God , what a vicious thing to do ! " " Yes , was n't it ? But my lord Gerridon insisted . ' So the little prince wants to be a Kencyr  --  like you . Very well . Grant him his wish . ' So I did . My lord has . . . strange whims sometimes . " Jame stared at him , struck by his tone . " Why , you hate this , do n't you ? You loathe what you 've done . But why do it at all ? Why is it so important that you take the Prince 's place ? " " Poor Jamie . No one ever explains anything to you , do they ? If Gerridon had the last time , you might not have panicked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that mistake . You see , there 's been a revolt among the changers . Some of them have taken over the Waster Horde and are leading it against the Kencyrath . Others of their number have tried several times now to kill both you and your brother : you , because of the blow your death would deal to the Master ; your brother , because at presenthe alone seems to be holding the Kencyrath together . If the rebel changers should finally succeed in eliminating him , before or even during the final battle , the Horde will surely defeat the Host . " " But would n't that please the Master ? " " In itself , yes , but then the rebels plan to use the Wasters to take over all of Rathillien to serve as a base against their former master . That prospect does not please my lord at all . He intends to pit his two enemies  --  the Kencyrath and the rebel changers  --  against each other . Whoever loses , Gerridon wins . But at the moment he 's far angrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ordered to sacrifice every man in the Prince 's army if necessary to support the Host against the Horde . " 66B-but the real prince would have done that , too . " " Oh yes , but consider the aftermath . If by some miracle the Host actually wins , there Prince Odalian is , ready to claim subjectally status . Torisen is a fair man . He wo n't refuse after all those Karkinorans have died fighting by his side . And when I have tasted his blood , why , I can replace him . Then , throughp233me , Gerridon of Knorth will again be Highlord of the Kencyrath . " She recoiled from him . " And when you and your precious Master have accomplished all this , what happens to Tori ? Will you chain him up in the shadows , too ? " " No . My lord may wish it , but I would never do such a thing to one of my lady 's children . Of course , " he went on thoughtfully , " if these were the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably kill him on the spot , just as it would have Odalian if he had drunk first . Considering that changers ' blood is corrosive enough to eat through tempered steel , it would be an excruciating way to die . The only worse fate I can think of would be that of a changer tricked into the rites with a Shanir blood-binder . The contest between the two bloods in his system would probably tear the changer to pieces , but I have no idea if even that would kill him . " But as for your brother , I promise : no chains in the dark , no death agonies . You see , all parts of a changer are virulent to some degree . My saliva in Torisen 's palm cuts will give me at least enough control over him to make his assassination relativelyeasy . He will die quickly , painlessly , probably within an hour of the rites . My word of honor on it . " " Honor ! " She almost spat the word back at him . " Do you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . The eyes took on a silver , inhuman sheen . Jame drew back , suddenly reminded that she was in very close quarters with something very dangerous . Then the changer rose and backed stiffly away until the shadows of a corner obscured his face . " Honor , " he repeated , in a voice clearly not the Prince 's . " Define it . " Jame was shaken . This was all so familiar , but her head was spinning worse now than ever , and she could n't quite grasp the memory . " W-we 've discussed this before , have n't we ? " " Many times . But you were a child then . Perhaps , since then , you 've learned something . " Jame found herself stammering something about always keeping one 's word , standing by friends , protecting the weak . . . . It all sounded perfectly idiotic blurted out like that , but she could n't seem to focus her thoughts.  | " Honor , " said the changer again in his dark corner . " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . One kept one 's word . One obeyed one 's lord . But then my lord ordered me to do what was dishonorable . I decided the shame was his alone and did as he commanded . I was wrong . But that was my choice , and I must stand by it . That is my honor now , for as long as I live . May I die soon . " " B-but that 's Honor 's Paradox ' ! " Jame stammered . " Tirandys , Senethari . . . c-can you die ? " " Fire will kill me , if it kindles my blood . " He gave a selfmockinglaugh . " We changers scorned death , and now each one of us is his own pyre , waiting for the first spark . I have often thought about that . " He went over to the fireplace , bent , and picked up a glowing ember in his bare hand . " I could hold this until it eats through the skin  --  " " Do n't ! " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not yet , while I still have a role to play , and not here . If I ever do fall , let it be far from this foul house . If only there were someplace so far away that my lady Jamethiel would not be sent to bring me back ; but she will be , even if I should fall at the worlds ' end . My lord Gerridon ca n't allow any of his loyal changers the luxury of death . He has too few of us left . " " Too few ... is everyone else dead or ... or has the House always been this empty ? " " For you , very nearly . You have always been confined to the House 's decayed present . The rest of us whom the Master favors can move through layers of its fallen past , not that that does us much good . Nothing ever changes . We tried to teach you the trick , but you were too young . " " Yes , yes . . . " Oh , if her head would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those death banners ... Tirandys , what 's been happening here ? Why did the changers revolt ? " " Why , quite simply the Master has very nearly devoured all the Highborn souls that the Mistress reaped for him on the night so many of us fell . That puts my lord Gerridon in rather an uncomfortable position . If immortality alone would satisfy him , he could accept the tainted souls which Perimal Darkling offers as gifts  --  or rather as bait . The shadows wish to enfold my lord , to ... to possess him . He served them best as Highlord when he betrayed his people and opened up the fallen worlds . Now they would have him serve them as their creature , their voice . It would be only justice for him to lose the humanity which he has bartered away in his followers , but he is far too clever a man to make so great an error  --  I think . If he wishes to remain both immortal and human , he must have more of his own kind to feed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Y-you still have your soul , Senethari ? " " Yes , however warped . All of us do who willingly took part in the Master 's treachery . That was to be our reward . The changers who have rebelled did so because they were afraid that as my lord 's hunger grew he would go back on his word and find a way to feed on them , too . As for those whose souls the Dream-Weaver did reap , most have become unfallen sacrifices to buy Gerridon his immortality . My brother Terribend is one . Poor Bender . He weakened for a moment , and his soul was stripped from him . Ever since , he has fought to regain it and to bring Gerridon to ruin ; but the Master is stronger than he and keeps his soul hostage . He wo n't believe that he and I have the same goals . In a sense , the Dream-Weaver herself is another one of Gerridon 's victims . She was only his tool and may yet save her compromised honor by choosing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both my honor and soul to see that . " " I-I do n't understand , " said Jame , through teeth that had begun to rattle together as if from the cold . " The Master has nearly run through his stolen Highborn souls . He needs more . Why ca n't he go back into the House 's past for them or  --  or have the Mistress reap more for him in the present ? " " He ca n't go back for more because the past does n't work that way . We can go through the same motions over and over , but they only really happened once , and nothing can change them , not even our foreknowledge of their consequences . The past is past , even when we move freely in it . As for the DreamWeaver , she has lived almost entirely in the House 's former days since she came back from the Haunted Lands . My poor lady may not have consented to the Master 's evil , but it was still too great to leave her unmarked . Now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as the fell creature she has become , which reaps souls with a touch whether she wants to or not , and she canp236neither give them back nor pass them on . The Master can only use her to bring home his injured changers , most of whose souls , like Keral 's and mine , are so deformed by now that they resist even her touch . Gerridon foresaw long ago that this would eventuallyhappen . When he found that opening the House to its fallen past did n't help , he sent Jamethiel Dream-Weaver across the Barrier to Ganth Gray Lord . You were the child that he wanted . Your brother came as an unwelcome surprise , just as , I gather , you did to Ganth . Twins have too much potential of their own . They do n't lend themselves well to other people 's schemes . Gerridon found that out when he tried to force you prematurely to become the new Mistress . You had n't fallen then . You have n't yet . . . quite . Perhaps now , you never will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves  --  swelling , crashing down , receding . She knew she was n't taking them all in . Only once before had she been drunk , and it had n't felt anything like this . This felt more like . . . dying ? You fool , do you always drink everything anyone hands you ? She tried to rise and fell , an interminable distance , it seemed . Now she was half on the bed , half in the changer 's arms . She looked up at him , astonished . " Senethari , y-you 've poisoned me . " " Yes . With wyrm 's venom in the wine . You drank some seven days ago when you first woke in Karkinaroth , and a great deal more just now . " " B-but why ? " " My lord commanded that you be drugged . He wants to take no chances with you this time , you see . It occurred to me , though , that you would be much better off dead , especially since that would end the horror for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has a few souls left to munch on  --  but soon , unless he 's fool enough to take what the shadows offer him . Then too , this is a game that should be played out among my lord Gerridon 's own generation , which he betrayed and damned for his own selfish ends . You should never have been brought into it , Jamie . Strictly speaking , you should never even have been born . This is the next best solution . Large doses of wyrm 's venom have unpredictable results , however . I don'tp237know if I 've killed you or not . You do understand , though , that I 've tried to act in your own best interests , do n't you ? " She was still staring up at him with wide gray eyes , but all understanding had left them . The lids fluttered and closed . He held her for a long minute , looking down at her face , then carefully picked her up and put her back on the bed . " If the worst happens , child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the Senethar by my example and honor by my mistakes . " He kissed her lightly on the lips . " Welcome home , Ja-mie. "  |p239THE  KENCYR HOST reachedthe far side of the White Hills well after dark on the seventeenth , after a forced march of nearly eighty miles . That same night , pyres were raised for those who had died in the hills and the pyric runes spoken . Then virtually everyone lay down around the dying flames and slept as if they themselves were the dead . Torisen spent the night wandering restlessly among them . Ashe watched the Highlord pass . Just so , forty years ago , Ganth had stalked among the dead on the slopes of the White Hills , and she had lain there , too weak from loss of blood to call out , watching him pass . Tonight she was silent again , for almost the same reason . Her mangled arm ached dully . She had not shown it to a physician . Early the next day , the Host again struck the River Road , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silver and the Ever-quick . The Kendar moved well after their night of dwar sleep . From now on , they would have its benefit every other night , and need it after the forty to fifty leagues they would cover every two days . It was a ruthless pace , but given the foot soldiers ' remarkable constitutions , the horses would probablywear out first . They were passing between the Elder Kingdoms now , with Bashti on the west bank and Hathir on the east . Thousands of years before , these two colossi had controlled most of the CentralLands ; but Hathir had long since disintegrated , and decayingBashti was a power now in name only . Consequently , thep240Host overtook very little traffic on the road and almost none on the river . The only time the Host met opposition was on the twentyfirstwhen Torisen again led it off the winding River Road to take a shortcut across a corner of the vast forest known as the Weald . Even at the height of its power , Bashti had never succeeded in imposing its rule here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies whole in its time . Huntsmen sometimes did better , but only one in a generation penetrated to the black oaks of the forest 's heart and returned alive to report that they were still there . In times of famine , the Weald might have been said to rule Bashti , when red-eyed wolves emerged from its tangled shadows to ravage the countryside and even to stalk the streets of Bashti 's proudest cities . But when the wolves came to town , they came as men , still red-eyed , but with fingers cunning enough to pick any lock and a hunger for women not always confined to the stomach . The corner that the Host cut was called the Grimly Holt . It was hardly as intimidating as the deep woods would have been , but the Kencyr still looked askance at its dense undergrowth and the green shadows of its maple and birch . The shattered remains of an old road led through it . Even when the road was new , though , it had never been well traveled for the Holt had its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vanguard of the Host saw quick flickers of movement in the undergrowth , and their horses danced nervously . Harn would have sent scouts out to investigate , but Torisen sharply forbade it . Harn and Burr exchanged glances . The Highlord had scarcely spoken to anyone in days and often moved as if in a waking dream . He barely slept at all since the White Hills . Burr noted that when not riding , Torisen limped more than ever . Harn wondered if the judgment of a sleepstarvedman , even this one , could be fully trusted . Both remembered the White Hills and what had happened the last time Torisen had led them off the road . Dusk fell , and a murmur as of wind passed under the leaves . But none of them moved . Abruptly , a stone whizzed out of the twilight and struck Burr on the shoulder , almost unhorsing him . In a moment , the air was full of flying objects , some rocks , some softer , but no lessp241objectionable . From the undergrowth came an excited yapping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hoy , Grimly ! " he shouted at the surrounding forest . " Stop that ! " The hail of stones ceased instantly . Again the murmur of rapid question and answer , and then a sudden , joyful yelp : " Hoy , Tori ! " A shaggy figure erupted from the undergrowth . Torisen dismounted . By the time Ardeth and his war-guard came charginginto the clearing , the Highlord was trying to disengage himself from the glad embrace of a young man wearing a wolf 's pelt  --  or was it his own ? All around them , other hairy figures had emerged from the forest to watch . " Lord Ardeth , my friend the Wolver Grimly , luckily at home . He spends part of the year at King Krothen 's court , playingthe wild man and studying rendish poetry . " The Wolver grinned . All his teeth came to very sharp points . That night , he and his people set a feast for all of the High Council who would come to the ruined keep that served as their lair . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook that gurgled down the length of what had once been the keep 's main hall ; and forest folk passed among them , shy , wild eyes glowing red in the firelight , filling horns with honey mead . Out in the Holt , the rest of the pack sang in yelps and long , crooning wails which took on the rhythms of some complex poetry . " You know , " said Lord Danior to Torisen in a low voice , " these wolves are n't anything like what I expected . All those horror stories must be pretty exaggerated , huh ? " " That depends . Grimly 's people live according to their own system of esthetics , and on the whole are less prone to violence than the average human . But the farther into the Weald you go , the wilder things get . The wolvers of the deep-wood Holts are as bad as you can imagine , if not a good deal worse . " " Yes , but how did any of them end up in King Krothen 's court ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of courtiers ? " The Wolver popped up beside him with a toothy grin . " Now , that 's a word to spit at . I 'm a poet , friend . A poet ! "
