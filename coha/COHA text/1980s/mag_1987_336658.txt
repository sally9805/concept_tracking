A wild ride in a Paris taxi can be an electrifying experience . Soon , it may prove to be even more shocking . Cabbies , alarmed by a recent wave of attacks by passengers , are eyeing a device called le siege qui brule , the hot seat . Wires beneath the rear seats are connected to the taxi 's battery . The driver can step on a pedal to deliver enough electricity to stun even a crazed gunman . <P> The hot seat was invented last year by two ex-soldiers in Israel , where 300 taxis are now wired . The device has been exported to Australia , West Germany and Saudi Arabia . The Israelis hope to start selling it in the U.S. by year 's end . Expected price tag : $350.
