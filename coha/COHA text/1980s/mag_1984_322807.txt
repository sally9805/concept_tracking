Photographer Catherine Leroy , on assignment for TIME , recently spent seven days on a supertanker as it plied the perilous waters of the Persian Gulf to take on 260,000 tons of crude oil at the Iranian oil depot at Kharg Island . The Swedish-built ship , which is owned by Americans and registered in Liberia , is currently chartered by a Japanese firm to carry its cargo to Europe . At the request of the ship 's owners , TIME agreed not to identify their vessel . Leroy 's report : <P> Only a few of the 24 Taiwanese crew members spoke English , but there is one thing that communicates itself easily : fear . The ship 's owner had said that it would be good for the crew to have a woman on board because it would " give them courage . " The captain , Chu Ching , 39 , has made ten trips to Kharg Island in the past year and was going back this time because he would earn a $5,000 bonus . " Dangerous ? That is non sense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> But once we were in Iranian waters , the fear became apparent . The trip from Fujairah to Sirri Island takes 20 hours and the trip to Kharg at the northern end of thegulf another 27 . We waited twelve hours at Sirri before the Iranians gave us permission to leave at a time when they felt the risk was lowest . At dinner that night the mood was somber , and people were silent . You could feel the tension growing . Everyone seemed to share the terrible feeling that , at twelve knots , we were going very slowly . <P> The night passed without incident . By mid-afternoon the next day , Kharg Island was in sight . About three miles out , the captain confiscated all cameras on board , explaining that no one is allowed to photograph the island . " If you take pictures , it is my life you are endangering , " he said . The light was magnificent , and you could see the high white cliffs of Kharg , with tankers in the distance . I kept telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stayed a day at Kharg while the tanker was being loaded . That night , as usual , we listened to the BBC and the Voice of America in the captain 's cabin . It did nothing for our nerves to hear a BBC report that our ship had supposedly been hit . Later , an Iranian official paid us a visit , accompanied by three Islamic guards in military fatigues . I was dressed in black , but the Iranians insisted that a veil of some sort be found for me . There was nothing suitable on board . Finally , the captain rushed to his bathroom and returned with a white bath towel , which I had to struggle to keep over my head during the interview . When asked what Iran would do if Iraq destroyed Kharg Island , as it has threatened to do if faced with an Iranian ground offensive , our visitor said , " They do n't understand the power we have . It is the power of God . " <P> When we left the next day , an Iranian tugboat followed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sea . On deck , the captain and a few officers were silent and unsmiling as they searched the horizon with binoculars . " I know if anything happens , there will be panic among the crew , " Captain Chu Ching said .
