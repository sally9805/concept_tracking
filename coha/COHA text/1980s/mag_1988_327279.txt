In the Sicilian countryside , helicopters clattered overhead in the early- morning dark as Italian police swooped in to raid a luxurious villa . In the streets of Palermo , Milan , Naples , up and down Italy last week , hundreds of narcotics investigators fanned out to collar scores of reputed Mafia drug traffickers . And across the Atlantic , U.S. FBI agents rounded up still more suspects in eight cities . A trail that began in Buffalo and Philadelphia three years ago had led the two countries to crack open a powerful transatlantic drug ring accused of flooding the U.S. with Italian heroin smuggled in wine bottles , tomato cans and the luggage of Sicilian housewives . At week 's end the arrests stood at 80 , a virtual Who 's Who of Mafiosi in Italy . <P> Last week 's arrests could be just the tip of the iceberg . When police severed the French Connection in the early 1970s , the Marseilles gang was replaced in the heroin business by the Mafia , which began using old cigarette- smuggling routes to accommodate the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's Heroin Central , and Mafia leaders had linked up with Latin American dealers to ship cocaine to the U.S. and Europe . <P> Today the Mafia is richer and more powerful than ever on drug-related profits estimated in the billions of dollars . La Piovra , or the Octopus , as the Mob has come to be called , has entwined its tentacles around Italy , frequently choking off the government 's power . Vincenzo Parisi , chief of the Italian state police , says the Mafia 's clout has made it a force strong enough to form an " anti-state . " Domenico Sica , the high commissioner named last summer for the specific task of fighting the Mafia , recently warned a parliamentary commission that organized crime was in " total control " of parts of Sicily , Calabria and Campania . The Mob 's lucrative drug trade has been shared with its crime families in America . <P> While the Mafia fed the world 's drug habit , the problem initially did not seem urgent in Italy . In 1975 Parliament passed one of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess an unspecified " modest quantity " of narcotics  --  even heroin and cocaine  --  for personal use . The legislation was hard only on dealers : they could be sentenced to 30 years in prison . <P> Now the scourge has hit home . Italy is ravaged by an epidemic of drug addiction more widespread and lethal than anywhere else in Europe . The country has the largest number of addicts on the Continent : an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 are hooked on heroin alone . So far this year , 700 Italians , mostly young people , have died from overdoses  --  another tragic record  --  with the highest death tolls in industrial centers like Milan and Turin . Says Milan Mayor Paolo Pillitteri : " The problem has exploded this year . The quantity of heroin and cocaine on the streets is enormous . " Every day , he says , special sanitation crews pick up some 4,000 syringes discarded by drug addicts . " It 's as big a problem as terrorism once was . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
