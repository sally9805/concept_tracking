The call was issued after a two-day meeting in Warsaw of all the country ' s bishops . Although the episcopate has previously called for an end to martial law , as in a pastoral letter read in churches Jan. 24 , the new statement was the strongest by the church since the military crackdown began Dec. 13 . Western diplomats predicted that once it was disseminated among Poland ' s 18 , 000 parishes , the document could provide a focus for popular discontent with martial law. // The bishops ' statement also indicated disagreement with the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Britain . <> <> Political Intention Denied // The episcopal conference came two weeks after Archbishop Jozef Glemp , the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland , returned from meetings with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican , and the statement gained strength from the presumption that it reflected the Pope ' s concerns. // " The situation in which the country and nation find themselves bears all the markings of a true moral , social and economic catastrophe , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their action , the churchmen said it was their mission to appeal for " social agreement " in the Polish nation. // Three days earlier Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski , the head of the martial law regime , had sounded a call at a meeting of the Communist Party for " national reconciliation " and included the church among those invited to respond . But besides avoiding the general ' s phrase , the bishops made clear that their vision of a national covenant was emphatically different . <> <> Bishops See Limits of Force // While the general spoke positively of the effects of martial law , the bishops said that " by sheer physical force , be it the mightiest , one can not honestly and in a lasting way resolve the problems of the life of the state . " Any social agreement , they said , could be achieved only in conditions of freedom. // " That is why , " the statement said , " the bishops , together with all of the society , expect that the state of war will end as speedily as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced for acts connected with the state of war will be granted amnesty , that persons in hiding will be allowed to emerge without consequence , and that no one will lose their job because of membership in a union. " // It said the parties to the social agreement were to include the " ruling authorities " and representatives of public organizations . Specifically , the bishops said that " representatives of temporarily suspended trade unions must not be excluded and must include the independent , self-governing trade union Solidarity , which has broad social support. " // Despite the denial of political content to their statement , the bishops also indirectly urged Poles to be realistic about living alongside the Soviet Union , and they indicated disagreement with the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and British Governments. // " It is the duty of society to be directed by a feeling of realism in the assessment of the geopolitical position of our country , " the statement said , apparently recalling the anti-Soviet sentiments that rose to the surface before martial law was declared . The clerics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or surrender of " national values , " but rather for an attitude of " realism and common sense. " // The veiled disapproval of sanctions apparently echoed the sentiments of the Pope . " The episcopate of Poland expressed deep gratitude for the assistance received from abroad and states that our country continues to require help from other countries to achieve economic stablization , " the statement said. // It also laid responsibility for the revival of foreign trade before the Government and expressed the conviction that achieving national agreement would help revive international economic cooperation . <> <> Archbishop Had Urged Unity // The statement followed considerable speculation in Poland and abroad about the role of the church , the most powerful source of potential opposition under martial law . Archbishop Glemp , who has been in office less than a year , has been accused of being overly cautious , and his sermons since Dec. 13 generally focused on calls for unity. // There has been no evidence , however , of any dimunition in the church ' s immense authority over the Polish people , of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial law , the church has played a critical role in visiting and ministering to more than 4 , 000 detainees , including Lech Walesa , the Solidarity leader. // The bishops made clear that they had no intention of surrendering any of the church ' s authority . They demanded " full freedom for religious life , " including the revival of organizations and publications suspended by martial law , and they sharply criticized recent efforts to take down crucifixes displayed in public places or to start up long-dormant efforts at propagating atheism among youths. // The bishops ' conference coincided and contrasted with sessions of the Communist Party ' s Central Committee and of the Parliament this week . At those meetings , delegates demonstrated broad support for General Jaruzelski , his call for national reconciliation and martial law , and they repeatedly accused Solidarity of having led the country to a state of near anarchy . <> <> Economic Changes Enacted // The session of Parliament concluded today with two minor changes in the Government and a resolution urging " broad social support for the endeavors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Jaruzelski . " Parliament also adopted a package of laws enacting various economic changes previously announced by the Government. // There was no immediate comment either by the church or by the authorities on the other ' s plea for unity , but it seemed unlikely that they would soon find common ground for negotiations . General Jaruzelski last week indefinitely put off lifting martial law , and the resolutions of the party and legislative sessions extinquished any hope that the Government was still seeking to negotiate with Solidarity. // Some reports in the official press critical of the clergy , and particularly of those permitted to visit detainees , have touched off speculation about a tougher official stance toward the church , but so far the martial law authorities have made no direct attack on the church or its activities. //
