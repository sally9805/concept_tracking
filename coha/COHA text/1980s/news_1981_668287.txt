By Charles L. Watkins Two of the most common questions asked by prospective computer owners are , " Do I need a computer ? " , and " What will it cost ? " . One quick answer is that if a computer makes or saves you significantly more money than it costs , you need it . This article illustrates some typical contributions and costs of a small business computer system . A computer can , of course , save your firm money by improving productivity in daily operations . Its most profound impact , however , may result from enhanced management visibility . Analysis of business patterns is often a luxury purchased in small quantities at the high cost of your own nights , weekends , and/or overtime expense . Here are just a few of the patterns that , once revealed , prove to be key management tools . Business trends - BULLET Product movement history BULLET Comparisons of current expenses to prior periods BULLET Analysis of each expense as a percentage of income or gross margin BULLET Actual expenses versus budgets BULLET Departmental profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BULLET Sales BULLET Gross margin Inventory Investment - BULLET Dollars invested and units on-hand BULLET Sales and profit contribution BULLET Dollars on-order BULLET Backlog summarization Credit and collections - BULLET Up-to-the-minute receivables aging BULLET Customers over or near credit limit A computer can give a businessman the tools he needs to shape and control his company ' s direction . Key reports are automatically and instantly available to him from equipment maintained at his own place of business . Every transaction processed strengthens the manager ' s planning and decision making base . Each invoice feeds sales reports , inventory requirements reports , and comparative income statements . Each paycheck feeds department profit and loss analyses and distributes labor expense . The following examples quantify the potnetial impact . Consider a hypothetical owner of a integrated Business Management Systemfrom Texas Instruments Supply Company . His firm , a $1.2 million company with a $300,000 inventory , is turning its inventory four times a year . After operating for one quarter with the T.I. Supplu Company system , the manager runs a rank ordered sales analysis , by product . He finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from 20 percent of his inventory dollars . Those top selling items are turning 16 times a year . ( ( $1.2M x 80 percent ) ? ! ( $300,000 x 20 percent ) FOOT MARK 16* . On the other hand , the rest of his inventory is turning only once a year ! By thinning his less active inventory only 25 percent , the firm reduces borrowed capital $60,000 . At 20 percent interest rates , this means annual cash flow improvements of $12,000 . Suppose the hpyothetical firm were running $182,000 in open receivables prior to installing the Texas Instruments Supply Company system . The system sorts through all old invoice details and reveals that $45,500 in receivables are over 30 days old , $20,000 more are over 60 days , and $17,000 are over 90 days . Using the credit limit feature of the Business Management System , the manager may be able to implement policies and individual customer limits that reduce delinquencies , say , 10 percent . He would recover $8250 in cash . Cutting bad debt expenses from 4 percent of sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors help determine the cost of a computer installed for a particular business . Probably one of the most confusing for the first time owner is an evaluation of file storage requirements . This is an especially important consideration in a fully integrated accounting system - one in which all postings and distributions are done at one time , automatically . For example , in an integrated accounting system , entry of an invoice simultaneously impacts customer credit records , physical inventory balances , and the balance sheet . Such integration requires that all relevant files be accessible to the system at the same time and thereby helps decide systemsize . Listed in the chart are typical file storage requirements for the hypothetical company discussed above .

However , the most common system Texas Instruments Supply Company sells has about 10 million characters . Such a system , complete with software and training , sells for about $35,500 . Accelerated depreciation , investment tax credits , write offs of interest and other expense reduce the average cash flow for that $35,500 computer system to under $330 per month , not including maintenance . With a 100% maintenance agreement , the monthly after tax cost is less than $500 . In our example above , the net impact to the business owner of the computer and the effective management decisions it supports is an average monthly improvement in after tax cash flow of $2860 .
