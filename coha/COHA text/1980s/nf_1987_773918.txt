txt // to exist , everything would have gone out of existence in the course of an infinite past ; nothing would exist now . But things do exist . Therefore , something must exist whose existence is necessary , something that could not possibly not exist , something that has generated and sustains the existence of the things that we observe . This necessary being is God . That phrasing of this argument is difficult , and the interpretations of it are diverse . Saint Thomas Aquinas claims that the things that we observe can either be or not be ( are contingent ) and must depend on some necessary being . First of all , a degree of sense must be given to the notion of a " necessary being . " Some proponents of the argument have suggested that a necessary being is one whose definition implies its existence . The definition of " chair " does not imply its existence ; the definition of " universe " does not imply its existence ; the definition of " God " does imply His existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the ontological argument and is subject to the same critique : no definition implies the existence of the thing defined . " Necessary being " could be a description of something that , as a matter of fact , is self-sufficient , eternal , and can not be destroyed : something that depends on nothing else for its existence . If one supposes that there never was or will be a time when nothing exists , then it follows that there is a " necessary being " ? at least in the trivial sense that this phrase could apply to the totality of things that ever exist . The emphasis of the argument would then shift to the claim that the things in the physical-mental world that we observe are " contingent " in the sense that they must depend on something else for their existence . It is true that the things we observe are generated and corrupted , but it is not clear that they disappear , as opposed to breaking down into more basic , enduring particles , or into energy . It is not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relations , must necessarily depend on something else for its existence ; it is not clear that the universe could not be a " necessary being " in the sense that it is self-sufficient . Yet if the cosmological argument is to be convincing , its proponents must show us why the universe is likely to be dependent on something else . // The third traditional argument for the existence of God is the teleological argument ( which derives its name from the Greek word for " end " / " goal " ) , or the " argument from design . " One version of this argument goes as follows : The complex universe is not chaotic but orderly ; its workings can be described by relatively simple scientific theories . Surely , it is more reasonable to suppose that this universe was designed by some Great Intelligence , God , than to suppose that it exists without design . Popular forms of this argument often gain apparent force by restricting one to a bogus dichotomy between design and chance . One is invited to consider two situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glass and carefully constructs a watch . The second : a woman takes some pieces of metal and glass and tosses them over her shoulder ; by chance the pieces fall together in such a way as to form a functioning watch . The advocate of the argument then says : Surely , it is more reasonable to suppose that the universe was formed as in the first situation rather than as in the second . If these were the only possibilities , a rational person would conclude that the universe was designed . But there is another possibility : that an orderly universe has always existed . Such a universe could not be said to have " happened by chance , " since that phrase describes some sort of haphazard beginning , and this third possibility supposes no beginning at all . However , the teleological argument can be formulated without using the design ? chance dichotomy . Another version would be this : In its orderly complexity , the universe ( and parts of the universe ) resembles human machines . Like effects have like causes . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like machines ) was designed than to suppose that it was not . There are several problems with this argument . We are supposed to be impressed by the close similarity between human machines and the universe ( or parts of it ) . But to make such a comparison we need a contrast . The universe is more like a human machine than ? what ? If we contrast machines with things that people just throw together , the argument assumes the design ? chance dichotomy again . We can not contrast human machines with natural processes because , according to the argument , natu62 GOD AND THE PROBLEM OF SUFFERING ral processes are designed like human machines . Thus , the argument seems to rule out legitimate , observable contrasts of the sort needed to establish the argument . Furthermore , human minds are not things isolated from natural processes but themselves come about via natural processes . Why , then , is it not just as reasonable to suppose that designs and minds are results of the natural orderliness of things ? Still , some people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that orderliness must come about through intelligence . But is this principal truly self-evident ? THE PROBLEM OF SUFFERING In any case , many a theist who takes the offensive with the teleological argument is soon on the defensive . Our universe seems to be morally defective : it contains terrible suffering . Is such suffering compatible with the supposition that the universe was designed by God ? In fact , does n't the existence of suffering prove that the universe was not designed by God ? As Martin says in " Surprise ! " : " The laws of the universe may be mathematically elegant , but they crush and they kill . No respectable God would allow people to suffer as they do .... As a moral assessment , one must say that if this world is designed , it is the work of a bumbler or a sadist . " The theist began by claiming that it is obvious that the universe is the handiwork of God . Now the theist must try to show that it is not totally absurd to suppose that the universe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of suffering . " In a sense , suffering is a problem just because people hate suffering . Religious persons in all periods of history have wondered why a God , or the Gods , would cause or allow human suffering . But what is called " the problem of suffering " is a particular version of this issue , namely the question : Does the existence of suffering show that there could not be a God who is omnipotent , omniscient , and perfectly good ? A theist who believes in a God who lacks one of these characteristics has a ready explanation for suffering : a God who lacks omnipotence or omniscience does not have the power or knowledge necessary to eliminate suffering , and a God who is not perfectly // good is morally defective and does n't care to eliminate suffering . But a theist who believes in a God who does possess all three of these characteristics is faced with a considerable problem . OMNIPOTENCE AND CONTRADICTION At first glance , it may seem obvious that the existence of suffering rules out the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfectly good . Such a God would create the best of all possible worlds . In the best of all possible worlds , there would exist human beings with free will who were happy and virtuous . Obviously , this world is n't such a world . Therefore , there is no such God . But many theists make the following reply : The world you have just described is not a possible world . The idea of creating such a world is contradictory . Even an omnipotent God could not do contradictory things . Therefore , God can in no way be blamed for not having created such a world . This reply poses two arguments that need to be elaborated in some detail : 1 . Even an omnipotent God could not do what is contradictory . 2 . The idea of creating a world in which human beings with free will are virtuous and happy is a contradiction . Throughout the centuries , many theologians have felt that God , to be omnipotent , must be able to do contradictory things . He must be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle that has four sides . To say that God can not do such things is to suppose that God is limited and hence not omnipotent . Today most philosophers and theologians reject the claim that an omnipotent God would have to do contradictory things . This claim , they say , results from a misunderstanding about the nature of contradictions . It supposes that contradictions describe the most difficult kind of tasks . In truth , contradictions describe nothing at all . In this sense , they are analogous to nonsense statements . One should no more expect an omnipotent God to create a chair that is not a chair than one should expect Him to " oop erg alban ipple ong . " In contradictory phrases , the individual words make sense but the combination of words is senseless . To say " create a chair that // is not a chair " is like drawing a picture of a chair on a blackboard , erasing the picture , then pointing to the board and saying , " There : make me one of those . " But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some difficult task or other ; nothing at all is por trayed there. * This issue is controversial , and the remarks above are too brief to do justice to the differing points of view . But for any theist who is tempted to say that an omnipotent God must be able to do contradictory things , one can add a rather powerful ad hominem argument , making the theist uncomfortable with his or her rea soning . One can say : You have just denied yourself any recourse to the traditional explanations of why God might have allowed suf fering . Many theists suppose that God , at the time of creation , was faced with certain forced options . He could either eliminate all suffering or create a world in which human beings had free will and might be virtuous . To do both would be contradictory . God quite properly chose to create a world in which human beings had free will and virtuousness , rather than creating a world in which they were unfree , nonvirtuous , and happy . As in the story " Sur-prise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses . " FREE-WILL DEFENSE The first defense of suffering , which can be called the free-will defense , claims that : Free will is a great good and a necessary ingredient in the best of all possible worlds . It would be contradictory for God to give human beings free will and yet guarantee that they never use their free will to harm themselves and others . Therefore , there is likely to be suffering in the best of all possible worlds . // To elaborate on 2 : If human beings have free will , then their choices are not caused . It would be contradictory for God to give human beings free will and , at the same time , control their choices so that they never make choices that would cause unhappiness . It is amazing how readily people accept the free-will defense . But there are serious questions one can raise about it . Most people do think that free will is a great good . But in the previous chapter , it was suggested that this opinion may result from a misunderstanding about what free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , one would probably decide that having free will would not be of much value . Even if one does believe that free will is a great good , one should ask whether it is really worth the great suffering it has supposedly caused . Often the options here are misconceived . Many religious tracts imply that the only alternative to a world with free will is a world in which people move about like zombies . Given our previous discussion , this is obviously false . Free will pertains only to the causes of one 's choices . It implies nothing about the particular characteristics of one 's facial expressions , movements , feelings , or thoughts . Free will , as we have seen , would not be an observable thing . What would you and others look like without free will ? You would look exactly the way you look now . God would have created people without free will who were lively , lovely , emotional , thoughtful , and who always chose happy courses of action . Would such a world so obviously have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not adequate to explain all suffering . It may account for the suffering caused by human beings . It does not account for the suffering caused by natural phenomena like diseases , earthquakes , and floods . Some theists do link the suffering caused by natural phenomena to human free will by claiming that such suffering is a punishment for misuse of freedom . But this argument really supplements the free-will defense as it has been presented here . It adds two premises . One : human beings did misuse their freedom , and God punished them by forcing them to live in a world of suffering . Two : the great suffering caused by natural events is proper punishment for human beings ' misuse of their freedom . Some critics , like Martin , find this second premise " barbaric . " // THE VIRTUE DEFENSE There is another defense that is often presented as a justification for the existence of suffering caused by natural phenomena . It implies that God was right in making certain that there would be some suffering in the world , whatever human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as the virtue defense , and it runs as follows : 1 . Virtues , such as generosity and courage , are great goods and , in the best of all possible worlds , human beings ought to have the chance to exercise such virtues . 2 . It would be contradictory to have virtues in a world without suffering , since the definitions of these virtues imply the existence of suffering . 3 . Therefore , suffering is a necessary ingredient in the best of all possible worlds . To enlarge on 2 : try to imagine someone being courageous in a world in which no one was afraid or in danger . It is impossible . To be courageous is to overcome fear ( which is necessarily painful ) and to risk oneself to help someone else . In a world with no pain and no risk of harm , no possible action could be courageous . Or try to imagine generosity in a world in which all persons had more than they needed . It is impossible . In such a world , any act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing another child a bucket of sand . Generosity involves some sacrifice to help another in need . In a world with no need , no possible action could be generous . This is an ingenious defense , and many find it reasonable . Others , however , do not . Some philosophers have said that this defense views virtue inside out . What is good about virtues is that they aim at the relief of suffering . Virtues are good as means only . Virtues are correctly called good in a world with suffering . But to insist on suffering in order to have virtue is absurd ; it contradicts the very nature of virtue . To insist on suffering so that there can be generosity and sympathy is like stealing from someone so that you can give that person some needed item or kicking someone in the shins so that you can feel sorry for that person . // The theist 's defenses do seem to be successful in showing that there is a morality such that , if God had accepted it , it would have committed Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " problem of suffering " comes down to an evaluation of this morality . Do you believe that free will and virtue are worth all the suffering in this world ? If you do , then you believe in the possibility of God who is omnipotent , omniscient , and perfectly good . If you do not , then you will deny that there could be such a God : if there is a God , He is acting on the wrong moral principles . " Surprise ! It 's Judgment Day " is meant to be provocative , so it contains something to get almost everyone a little bit angry . Some would claim that there is much more to be said on God 's behalf ; others would claim that there is much more to be said for the position that Martin first endorses and then abnegates in his horror at becoming " only happy . " The story may assume a dichotomy that is bogus and that is , in some ways , to the theist 's advantage . The only options presented in the story are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy zombies . But would n't the best of all possible worlds be better than either of these ? Might it not be a world in which human beings are created to be happy , intelligent , inquisitive , and appreciative of beauty ? Or is this the description of a contradictory world ? The debate , of course , goes on . READINGS Rene Descartes ( 1596 ? 1650 ) : the ontological argument . I find it manifest that we can no more separate the existence of God from his essence than we can separate from the essence of a rectilinear triangle the fact that the size of its three angles equals two right angles , or from the idea of a mountain the idea of a valley . Thus it is no less self-contradictory to conceive of a God , a // supremely perfect Being , who lacks existence ? that is , who lacks some perfection ? than it is to conceive of a mountain for which there is no valley . But even though in fact I can not conceive of a God without existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , just as from the mere fact that I conceive a mountain with a valley , it does not follow that any mountain exists in the world , so likewise , though I conceive of God as existing , it does not seem to follow for this reason that God exists . For my thought does not impose any necessity upon things ; and just as I can at my pleasure imagine a winged horse , even though no horse has wings , so I could perhaps attribute existence to God , even though no God existed . This is far from the truth ; it is here that there is sophistry hidden under the guise of a valid objection . For from the fact that I can not conceive a mountain without a valley it does not follow that there is a mountain or a valley anywhere in the world , but only that the mountain and the valley , whether they exist or not , are inseparable from each other . From the fact alone that I can not conceive God except as existing , it follows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , in truth , exist . Not that my thought can bring about this result or that it imposes any necessity upon things ; on the contrary , the necessity which is in the thing itself ? that is , the necessity of the existence of God ? determines me to have this thought . For it is not in my power to conceive of a God without existence ? that is to say , of a supremely perfect Being without a supreme perfection ? as it is in my power to imagine a horse either with or without wings . St. Thomas Aquinas ( 1225 ? 1274 ) : the cosmological argument . The third way is taken from possibility and necessity and runs thus . We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be , since they are found to be generated , and to corrupt , and consequently , they are possible to be and not to be . But it is impossible for these always to exist , for that which is possible not to be at some time is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // then at one time there could have been nothing in existence . Now if this were true , even now there would be nothing in existence , because that which does not exist only begins to exist by something already existing . Therefore , if at one time nothing was in existence , it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to exist ; and thus even now nothing would be in existence ? which is absurd . Therefore , not all beings are merely possible , but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary . But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by another , or not . Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which have their necessity caused by another , as has been already proved in regard to efficient caused . Therefore we can not but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity , and not receiving it from another , but rather causing in others their necessity . This all men speak of as God . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In crossing a heath , suppose I pitched my foot against a stone , and were asked how the stone came to be there ; I might possibly answer , that , for anything I knew to the contrary , it had lain there forever : nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer . But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground , and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place : I should hardly think of the answer which I had before given , that , for anything I knew , the watch might have always been there . Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for the stone ? Why is it not as admissible in the second case , as in the first ? For this reason , and for no other , viz. that , when we come to inspect the watch , we perceive ( what we could not discover in the stone ) that its several parts are framed and put together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adjusted as to produce motion , and that motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day ; that if the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are , of a different size from what they are , or placed after any other manner , or in any other order , than that in which they are placed , either no motion at all would have been // carried on in the machine , or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it .... This mechanism being observed ( it requires indeed an examination of the instrument , and perhaps some previous knowledge of the subject , to perceive and understand it ; but being once , as we have said , observed and understood ) , the inference , we think , is inevitable ; that the watch must have had a maker ; that there must have existed , at sometime , and at some place or other , an artificer or artificers , who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor would it , I apprehend , weaken the conclusion , that we had never seen a watch made , that we had never known an artist capable of making one ; that we were altogether incapable of executing such a piece of workmanship ourselves , or of understanding in what manner it was performed ; all this being no more than what is true of some exquisite remains of ancient art , of some lost arts , and , to the generality of mankind , of the more curious productions of modern manufacture ... . Nor , ... would it yield to his inquiry more satisfaction to be answered , that there existed in things a principle of order , which had disposed the parts of the watch into their present form and situation . He never knew a watch made by the principle of order ; nor can he even form to himself an idea of what is meant by a principle of order distinct from the intelligence of the watchmaker ... . Suppose , in the next place , that the person who found the watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to all the properties which he had hitherto observed in it , it possessed the unexpected property of producing , in the course of its movement , another watch like itself ( the thing is conceivable ) , that it contained within its mechanism , a system of parts , a mould for instance , or a complex adjustment of lathes , files , and other tools , evidently and separately calculated for this purpose ; let us inquire , what effect ought such a discovery to have upon his former conclusion . The first effect would be to increase his admiration of the contrivance , and his conviction of the consummate skill of the contriver ... . The question is not simply , How came the first watch into exREADINGS 71 istence ? , which question , it may be pretended , is done away by supposing the series of watches thus produced from one another to have been infinite , and consequently to have had no such first , for which it was necessary to provide a cause . This , perhaps , would have been nearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us but an unorganized , unmechanized substance , without mark or indication of contrivance . It might be difficult to show that such substance could not have existed from eternity , either in succession ( if it were possible , which I think it is not , for unorganized bodies to spring from one another ) or by individual perpetuity . But that is not the question now . To suppose it to be so , is to suppose that it made no difference whether we had found a watch or a stone . As it is , the metaphysics of that question have no place ; for , in the watch which we are examining , are seen contrivance , design ; an end , a purpose ; means for the end , adaptation to the purpose . And the question which irresistibly presses upon our thoughts , is , whence this contrivance and design ? .. . The conclusion which the first examination of the watch , of its works , construction , and movement , suggested , was , that it must have had , for the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood its mechanism , and designed its use . This conclusion is invincible . A second examination presents us with a new discovery . The watch is found , in the course of its movement , to produce another watch , similar to itself : and not only so , but we perceive in it a system or organization , separately calculated for that purpose . What effect would this discovery have or ought it to have , upon our former inference ? What , as hath already been said , but to increase , beyond measure , our admiration of the skill which had been employed in the formation of such a machine ! Or shall it , instead of this , all at once turn us round to an opposite conclusion , viz. that no art or skill whatever has been concerned in the business , although all other evidences of art and skill remain as they were , and this last and supreme piece of art be now added to the rest ? Can this be maintained without absurdity ? Yet this is atheism . This is atheism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , which existed in the watch , exists in the works of nature ; with the difference , on the side of nature , of being greater and more , and that in a degree which exceeds all computation . I // mean , that the contrivances of nature surpass the contrivances of art , in the complexity , subtlety , and curiosity of the mechanism ; and still more , if possible , do they go beyond them in number and variety : yet , in a multitude of cases , are not less evidently me chanical , not less evidently contrivances , not less evidently accom modated to their end , or suited to their office , than are the most perfect productions of human ingenuity . John Hick presents a Christian defense of suffering . Theodicy , * as many modern Christian thinkers see it , is a modest enterprise , negative rather than positive in its conclusions . It does not claim to explain , nor to explain away , every instance of evil in human experience , but only to point to certain considerations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains ) from constituting a final and insuperable bar to rational belief in God . In indicating these considerations it will be useful to follow the traditional division of the subject . There is the problem of moral evil or wickedness : why does an all-good and all-powerful God permit this ? And there is the problem of the non-moral evil of suffering or pain , both physical and mental : why has an all-good and all-powerful God created a world in which this occurs ? Christian thought has always considered moral evil in its rela tion to human freedom and responsibility . To be a person is to be a finite center of freedom , a ( relatively ) free and self-directing agent responsible for one 's own decisions . This involves being free to act wrongly as well as to act rightly . The idea of a person who can be infallibly guaranteed always to act rightly is self-contra dictory . There can be no guarantee in advance that a genuinely free moral agent will never choose amiss . Consequently , the pos sibility of wrongdoing or sin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to say that God should not have created beings who might sin amounts to saying that he should not have created people ... . // ... an enormous amount of human pain arises either from the inhumanity or the culpable incompetence of mankind . This includes such major scourges as poverty , oppression and persecution , war , and all the injustice , indignity , and inequity which occur even in the most advanced societies . These evils are manifestations of human sin ... . Even though the major bulk of actual human pain is traceable to man 's misused freedom as a sole or part cause , there remain other sources of pain which are entirely independent of the human will , for example , earthquake , hurricane , storm , flood , drought , and blight . In practice , it is often impossible to trace a boundary between the suffering which results from human wickedness and folly and that which falls upon mankind from without . Both kinds of suffering are inextricably mingled together in human experience . For our present purpose , however , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it seems to be built into the very structure of our world . In response to it , theodicy , if it is wisely conducted , follows a negative path . It is not possible to show positively that each item of human pain serves the divine purpose of good ; but , on the other hand , it does seem possible to show that the divine purpose as it is understood in Judaism and Christianity could not be forwarded in a world which was designed as a permanent hedonistic paradise . An essential premise of this argument concerns the nature of the divine purpose in creating the world . The skeptic 's assumption is that man is to be viewed as a completed creation and that God 's purpose in making the world was to provide a suitable dwellingplace for this fully formed creature . Since God is good and loving , the environment which he has created for human life to inhabit is naturally as pleasant and comfortable as possible . The problem is essentially similar to that of a man who builds a cage for some pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of hardship , inconvenience , and danger of innumerable kinds , the conclusion follows that this world can not have been created by a perfectly benevolent and all-powerful deity . Christianity , however , has never supposed that God 's purpose in the creation of the world was to construct a paradise whose inhabitants would experience a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of pain . The world is seen , instead , as a place of " soul-making " // in which free beings , grappling with the tasks and challenges of their existence in a common environment , may become " children of God " and " heirs of eternal life . " .. . ... Suppose , contrary to fact , that this world were a paradise from which all possibility of pain and suffering were excluded . The consequences would be very far-reaching . For example , no one could ever injure anyone else : the murderer 's knife would turn to paper or his bullets to thin air ; the bank safe , robbed of a million dollars , would miraculously become filled with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scale , proving inflationary ) ; fraud , deceit , conspiracy , and treason would somehow always leave the fabric of society undamaged . Again , no one would ever be injured by accident : the mountain-climber , steeplejack , or playing child falling from a height would float unharmed to the ground ; the reckless driver would never meet with disaster . There would be no need to work , since no harm could result from avoiding work ; there would be no call to be concerned for others in time of need or danger , for in such a world there could be no real needs or dangers . To make possible this continual series of individual adjustments , nature would have to work by " special providences " instead of running according to general laws which men must learn to respect on penalty of pain or death . The laws of nature would have to be extremely flexible : sometimes gravity would operate , sometimes not ; sometimes an object would be hard and solid , sometimes soft . There could be no sciences , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminating the problems and hardships of an objective environment , with its own laws , life would become like a dream in which , delightfully but aimlessly , we would float and drift at ease . One can at least imagine such a world . It is evident that our present ethical concepts would have no meaning in it . If , for example , the notion of harming someone is an essential element in the concept of a wrong action , in our hedonistic paradise there could be no wrong actions ? nor any right actions in distinction from wrong . Courage and fortitude would have no point in an environment in which there is , by definition , no danger or difficulty . Generosity , kindness , the agape aspect of love , prudence , unselfishness , and all other ethical notions which presuppose life // in a stable environment , could not even be formed . Consequently , such a world , however well it might promote pleasure , would be very ill adapted for the development of the moral qualities of human personality .

The people there are to be envied above all others , for that which is to us the most perplexing mystery of our existence is to them no mystery at all . As I stepped from that treacherous forest through which I had wandered , lost , for five days , the first being I encountered in the land of Certus was Felanx . He was a roughhewn , kindly farmer who greeted me at the edge of his fields and offered me the hospitality of his home . Yet he frightened me at first . For when he smiled , there came from his face a strange green light , and I drew back , thinking him a sorcerer . But after a time , he succeeded in calming me with his gentle manner . He said that the light would not harm me and that he would explain it presently . Felanx led me to the high stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , through the narrow cobblestone streets to his home . As his family welcomed me , there were more flashes of that green light . But his son , who would not approach me , glowed a faint red . Felanx spoke harshly to the boy and dismissed him . I was seated by the fire , given warm drink , and promised supper . I was no longer fearful of those strange lights , but my curiosity became too much to bear . I asked Felanx to provide me with the explanation he had promised . " It is quite simple , " he said . " From others who have come to our land , we know that these lights do not exist in other parts of the world . So I understand your confusion . Yet to us the lights seem most natural , and we can not imagine a land that is otherwise . The green light is the light of the good . The red light , it shames me to say , is the light of the bad . You saw it around my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good boy , but sometimes he does not show the proper hospitality to strangers . He has been disciplined . Please accept my apologies on his behalf . " " The lights of good and bad ! " I exclaimed . " This is trickery . Do you take me for a fool ? " As I spoke thus to my host , red light burst before my eyes , and 77 // I began to stammer in confusion . But once again , Felanx put me at ease . He said that he understood and forgave my skepticism . He said that once I had had a chance to observe his land further and to reflect on the matter , I would realize that he had spoken the truth . I marveled at the words of my host . To have all good and bad deeds clearly marked so that everyone should know them for what they were : could anything be a greater boon to humanity ? I hesitated to believe , and yet had I not seen these lights with my own eyes ? After some thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question , " said Felanx , " there is no answer that seems to satisfy all . One answer is given in The Book of the Beginning . It says that the Creator made the skies and the earth and then , because He was lonely , He created human beings to be His companions . He put human beings in the most beautiful place on earth , the Valley of Peace , and He dwelt there with them . For a time all was happiness . But after a number of years , some people became restless . They said that they wanted to see what lay beyond the valley . The Creator told them there was nothing beyond the valley so happy and so lovely as it was . Still , many wanted to go . The Creator granted them permission at last , saying that He would constrain no one to stay with Him . But He was very angry . He told those who departed that they would find great sorrow in the lands beyond the valley and that they would never find their way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator and pleaded in tears for her descendants . Was it right , she asked , that they should all suffer for the folly of her headstrong daughter , who was among those who wished to leave ? At her words , the Creator relented . He said that He would give those who departed the lights of good and bad , so that they would know how to make themselves worthy to return to the valley . He said that one day He would walk the earth and lead those who glowed with the goodness of green back to the Valley of Peace . " That , I say , is just one answer . It is the one that my wife accepts . Others have argued that there is no Creator , that the skies and the earth have always been . They say that the lights of good and bad are simply natural events that require no supernatFICTION : // ural explanation . The light of the good , they say , is no more mysterious than the other colors of things whose significance is beauty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked that in my land there were also doubts about a Creator . But the disputes of the Certans were as nothing compared with ours . For in my land , each person interpreted good and bad " according to his or her own lights , " and what each person saw was different . At least in Certus there were no doubts about goodness and badness : the lights were the same for everyone . And if there were doubts about a Creator , at least there could be no doubt how to please Him , should He exist . The next day , Felanx showed me around the town and introduced me to many of the townspeople . All those I met showed me the utmost kindness . They were eager to hear stories of my travels and to answer any questions I might have . In fact , I was preoccupied with just one question , and it was answered not by what was said to me but by what I observed for myself . I saw that the green lights did indeed mark acts of goodness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certans are a bad people . On the contrary , they are a fine people . But they are human , and they make mistakes . The red light allows them to see their mistakes at once and to correct them . At one home , we drank a delicious plum whiskey , and the green light over the gathering answered for me a question that divided those in my land , the question of whether it is evil to drink alcohol . The green light told me that drinking is good , though only in moderation . When one of the group became drunken , he glowed with a red light . He was led from the room , apologizing to us all . As we emerged from another house , I noticed a ragged fellow stumbling as if inebriated , glowing the brightest of reds . The others with me jeered at him , but the fellow only smiled and made a sign with his hands , which I was given to understand was the vilest of profanities . I was surprised by the existence of this reprobate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His name is Georges , and he is a difficult case , " said Felanx . " At first , some thought that he might be blind to the lights of good and bad , as some are blind to colors and shapes . But he answers questions about the lights correctly . He just wo n't be guided by // them . He knows the good but does n't want to do it . His case is now before the town council . My guess is that there will be extreme punishment . " " But how can a man know the good and not want to do it ? " I exclaimed . At once I saw the foolishness of my remark , remembering that in the sacred book of my land it says that many fall not through ignorance but through the wickedness of the heart . I told Felanx of this . " And so it says in The Book of the Beginning . But Georges is especially dangerous . Not only does he say that he often prefers wickedness to goodness , but he suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what pleases them and should disregard the lights . " " But how can he be dangerous ? " I asked . " Surely anyone can see that if all were to do as they pleased , with no thought of the good , with no thought of others , the result must be chaos , disastrous for all . " " Of course , " said Felanx . " But Georges is subtle . He says that what all people should prefer is not only their own pleasures but also the pleasures of others . It is this that seems to absolve him of selfishness in the eyes of the young , and many are drawn by his words . " I shook my head sadly , reflecting on the perversity of human beings . As we walked on through the streets , my attention was drawn to the cannons placed along the town walls . I asked Felanx about them . " You have learned today that there are two towns in Certus : ours , which is Rechtsen , and another which is Linksen . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Linksens . But now that you know of the wicked Georges , you might as well know all . " The Linksens are our mortal enemies . They have a religion that denies our own . They say that the lights of good and bad are not the work of the Creator , but the work of the Creator 's enemy . They say that the lights of good and bad have been put in this land to confuse and lead astray the Creator 's true friends . They say that we should not follow the lights , but should instead follow the // laws written in their book . These laws , they believe , express the Creator 's true wishes . " I could not restrain myself at this absurdity . " But surely they could be shown the truth . Listen : if at this moment , heaven forbid , I should strike you down for no reason , there would be a ferocious blaze of red . Is it not so ? " " Of course . " " And would it be the same in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in Linksen . " " There , then . Surely the Linksens can not believe that such an act could be right or that the Creator would wish it . Were they to believe so , there would now be none of them left . This must prove to them that the lights show the truth . " Felanx lowered his head , and I sensed that he was close to tears . " Alas , they too have their vicious subtleties . Were you to compare their rules of the good and the bad with the lights of the good and the bad , you would find much agreement . It is this , they say , that shows the cleverness of the Creator 's enemy . He makes the lights so that they seem to show the truth in every case . It is this that misleads so many . The Linksens say that women should be equal to men , that animals are not to be eaten , and that the Rechtsens are to be destroyed . That the red light shows on such deeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day that had begun with such joy had turned out sad , and I went to bed that evening with a heavy heart . I had always held the hope that as the nature of goodness became clearer to human beings , they would become better and better . Yet here in Certus , where all had been made clear , wickedness and dissension continued . Was there indeed any hope for humanity ? I awoke the next morning to the sound of a crowd 's yelling in the courtyard . I moved through the empty house and went outside . A hundred of the townspeople were gathered in the marketplace , viewing some spectacle . Moving into the crowd , I saw what it was . Georges was lying naked on a wooden platform , his body shackled . He was writhing and screaming , as one of the men standing over him slowly snapped the bones in his fingers with some heavy metal instrument . A glance at Georges 's body and at the fiendish instruments held by the men around him indicated that this was // just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stake and a mound of faggots where later they would burn his disfigured body . I turned away in anger and horror , searching the faces in the crowd . All were watching the brutal spectacle with slight , solemn smiles . I saw Felanx near me and grabbed his arm . " How can you do this ? " I cried . " You who say you love the good . " " Georges is paying the price of his wickedness . The council decided last night . Georges ignores the good and incites others to do the same . He has to be punished . He has to be made an example . It is right that he be punished . " " Punished , yes , " I said . " Perhaps even killed . But not like this . This is barbaric ! This is horrible ! " Felanx pulled away from me , and his expression became fierce . He moved his hand , and for a moment I thought he was going to strike me . Instead he pointed toward Georges . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is too terrible . " " Look at the men who are carrying out the sentence . " Reluctantly , I glanced toward the terrible scene . Then I saw what had escaped my attention before . The torturers of Georges were all glowing a faint green . This act that I had so readily condemned was , in fact , good , right . Suddenly my horror turned to shame . " Forgive me , " I said , bowing my head . There was a moment of silence before Felanx spoke . " You are forgiven , my friend , my guest . But I must concern myself now with your safety . The Linksens know of Georges 's punishment . Their leaders have told the people that Georges is their spy and is suffering for their cause . This is not so , and the leaders know it . It is a mere pretext for attack . But they will attack our city . You must leave at once . " " Let me stay , " I pleaded , ashamed at having wrongly condemned the Rechtsens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not gladly sacrifice it for the sake of the good . " " I believe that , " said Felanx . " But this is not your land , and this is not your battle . You must go . " I kept pleading until I noticed that a red glow began to arise from my body . Then I stopped . I had already committed one grievFICTION : // ous error that day ; I must not commit another . If it was wrong for me to stay there , then I must go . An hour later , Felanx led me to the town gate , where he bade me goodbye and turned me over to the guide who was to lead me through the woods along a tortuous trail , which I fear I shall never find again . The land of Certus is often in my thoughts . For it seems to me that if there is any hope for humankind , it must lie with those brave people of Rechtsen who know the good , follow it , and will fight for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . Those Who Help Themselves The war with the planet Omega is won . Its cities have been destroyed , its social institutions overthrown , its people injured and anguished . We have just destroyed what may have been the only truly moral civilization that ever existed . The Omegans are not innocent victims ; the guilt is not all ours . But however one places the blame , one can not help regretting this war . The universe is a sadder place for the passing of what Omega once was . All the civilizations that remain are morally defective . On Earth , in this twenty-second century after Jesus , in this third century after Marx , we certainly have not achieved what anyone would be tempted to call " utopia . " At the moment , of course , the situation is fairly stable . Birth control and the calamitous Far Eastern wars have drastically reduced the Earth 's population . The nutrition extracted from the oceans and the wealth " extracted " from other worlds have appeased , momentarily , those who are left alive . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have our victors and victims . As for other planets , the pathetic , vegetablelike creatures on Beta , though incapable of doing us harm , are vicious : they kill one another with grotesque frequency . The Alphas , who have more military capability , have friendly relations with us , but they are unspeakably cruel to their slave classes . The moral situation on the planet Epsilon is comparable to that on Earth . The Gammas seemed to be the finest people we had encountered , until we discovered that they were merely protoplasmic machines and hence exempt from moral judgments . Ten years ago , the age-old pessimism about " human nature " had developed into a pessimism about all " living nature . " The discovery of Omega forced us to modify our pessimism , but only slightly . It still seems reasonable to surmise that almost all life forms in the universe are , and will continue to be , morally corrupt . 84 // How one explains this depressing fact is a side issue . One may speak of original sin or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact remains that virtually all life forms are fundamentally self-interested and aggressive , capable , at best , of some sympathy for a small number of their own kind . Moral inspiration has little effect on behavior . Threats , both natural and supernatural , accomplish more , but not nearly enough . One suspects that the only conceivable near-utopia for most races would be a world of such abundance that individuals would be too busy gorging themselves to think of taking advantage of others . But there could never be such abundance . And , even if there were , doubtless there would still be some who would find their greatest pleasure in causing others pain . At least such pessimism affords a certain comfort . If moral failure is indeed universal , then it may be inevitable and therefore no one 's fault . The discovery of Omega challenged this deterministic view and threatened us with self-contempt . The Omegans had managed to be moral . Perhaps we truly were responsible for our failures . No doubt we would have liked the moral contrast between us and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there were none of any consequence . The Omegans are a small people , averaging just over four feet in height , and their flesh is green . They have three eyes in a triangular formation , one mouth , and fifteen sound receptors located on various parts of the body . They have two legs , which are proportionately quite short , and four appendages at the side of the body . Two of these function like our arms and hands . The other two create , by the friction of the " fingers , " the complex sounds by which they communicate . Their conceptual structure is analogous to our own and was easily deciphered by the Q-104 Computer Language Translator . The Omegans we confronted were a people quite similar to us in all but one respect : they were morally good . Naturally , we tried to explain away the apparent superiority of the Omegans . Could it be that they , like the Gammas , really had no minds ? No : they had thoughts and feelings just as we did . Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also had problems of scarcity . Had they been endowed , through an evolutionary fluke , with an innate compulsion to be unselfish ? a // compulsion for which they , of course , could claim no credit ? No : they were a people with that strong self-interest which morality attempts to tame . There seemed to be no way to rationalize the goodness of those people . We were not , of course , struck at once by the moral superiority of the Omegans ; goodness can not be seen at a glance . We became aware of it only gradually . In fact , our first impression of the Omegans was quite negative . Initially , they were hostile to us , and they remained suspicious throughout our visit . Admittedly , such inhospitality toward strangers could be considered a moral defect . Nonetheless , it is true that , within their civilization , the Omegans ' conduct was nearly impeccable . Naturally , what the Omegans did to be moral was in no way startling . We , on Earth , know quite well the dictates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like . ( This is true in general , even if there are marginal disagreements about the nature of the good and the right . ) Our problems result not from lack of knowledge , but from lack of ability or willingness . Had the conduct of the Omegans been totally bizarre , our moral terms would not have applied . But the moral concepts of the Omegans were quite similar . What was startling was that they managed to put them into practice . The distribution of goods on Omega was not equal , but it was nearly so . In theory , the government was charged with enforcing equal distribution ; in practice , little enforcement was necessary . The Omegans readily handed over their surplus goods for others in need , and the government had only to coordinate such generosity to see that it was orderly and that its results were equitably distributed throughout the society . The Omegan government was democratic . The Omegans had a lively interest in debate , but they avoided ad hominem arguments , addressing themselves to issues , rather than personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campaigning for public offices was vigorous but marked by neither overweening ambition nor rancor . It was indeed a democratic community . The Omegan ? avoided the anarchy and power politics that are the central defects of so many democracies . All individuals showed a real concern for the ongoing welfare of the whole . The Omegans were a highly energetic , industrious people . They // were even , one might say , competitive . But one did n't sense that they were really competing against one another . Each success was celebrated , to a large degree , as a success for all and as an example to others . Each success was measured against the person 's potential , and living up to one 's potential , whatever it might be , brought the highest respect . The Omegans were not without individual ambition and pride , but they were quite temperate in these . The Omegans had a considerable interest in the arts and sciences . None of us was qualified to judge their " music , " which , because of the vastly different sounds they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary style was difficult to judge , but the content of their literature seemed intricate and imaginative , entertaining , and sometimes profound . We were particularly impressed by their art , which showed a fine sense of line and color . Generally , their art tended to have a much more optimistic tone than ours ; but only our most melancholy critics would find this cause for complaint . For the most part , their scientific achievements were the equal of ours , and apparently their medical skills were superior . They had been slower to develop space technology , presumably because they had little incentive to leave their planet . For obvious reasons , they had not developed sophisticated weaponry ? at least until fifty years ago . At that time , they had begun to decode communications between other planets and had discovered , to their shock , the hostile nature of other life forms . Defense development had begun at once , and their crash program yielded remarkable weapons in a relatively short period of time . They had even managed to repel an attack from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astonishingly , such weapons were never used by Omegans against one another . If many Earth people felt that the Omegan society was not quite ideal , many Omegans felt the same way . In fact , there were a number of political parties . The biggest opposition party wanted to enlarge the competitive market for the material goods of Omega . Another party , somewhat smaller , wanted no competition and a perfectly equal distribution of goods . There were also fringe groups asking for , say , a greater emphasis on the arts or a greater allocation of funds to defense research . But all such parties constituted a loyal opposition . All felt that the Omegan society was close // enough to their ideal so that they could live quite happily with the status quo . All recognized the ongoing value of democracy and of relative stability . No party ? indeed , no person ? had ever advocated a violent revolution . Because of the conspicuous absence of religion on Omega , there was no inclination to disrupt human welfare for the sake of some supernatural ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no religion on Omega . Certainly there was no belief in a God , and there were no ceremonies of reverence for the universe . But there was one metaphysical belief , shared by all Omegans , that might be considered " religious . " It apparently developed in their prehistory , and , if its beginnings were associated with revelations or proofs , there were no existing indications of such , even in the guise of myths . That this belief was so implicit in the Omegans ' consciousness ? no one had to be persuaded , it was never argued ? kept it from our notice for some time . But even the Omegans ' expression of this belief was misinterpreted by us at first . A phrase like " that unfortunate man might be me " sounded so much like the imaginative exhortations of our moralists that we failed to comprehend that the phrase was intended literally . Finally we did understand , and , in understanding , I suppose , we discovered the " secret " of the Omegan 's moral behavior . The Omegans believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of some divinity , but simply the natural way of things . Almost as soon as a person died , the soul was reborn in the body of some infant , with all memories of the past life erased . This reincarnation , they believed , was not only natural , but random : merits and demerits in a past life had nothing whatever to do with a soul 's replacement in the next life , and one 's inclinations and abilities were not transferred from one life to another . In the next life , the woman of great intellect might be retarded , the man of good health might be diseased , the person of great culture might be interested only in popular entertainments ? or vice versa . One might be reborn the same or quite different.4 There was no way of knowing in advance . I The moral efficacy of this belief is obvious . It is a consequence of this belief that , in promoting a society in which each person helps others , one is quite literally helping oneself . No one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same position . // There were , as has been noted , some differences of opinion on Omega concerning the moral and political status quo . Apparently , those supporting the largest opposition party were gamblers : they were willing to risk the possibility of some misfortune in the next life for the possibility of gaining great wealth in this life . Those on the opposite end of the political spectrum were unwilling to gamble at all with their future lives : they wanted to be guaranteed an equal share of the wealth . Those who supported the majority party wanted some guarantees and some chances to gamble . But none was willing to gamble too much with his or her future life , to risk being diseased , mentally defective , or hungry , and being without help . Thus , each was agreed that all should be helped and was highly motivated to help others . Guarantees in no way sapped the industriousness of the Omegans , since all would share in the future benefits of their own labors . There were , of course , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to emphasize their present rather than their future welfare . But they gave in to this temptation very rarely . Morally , the Omegans had a magnificent civilization . Some Earth critics of the Omegan war say that we came to conquer . Leaving aside our moral qualms ( which those critics might deny we have ) , we simply do not have the power to conquer and control a universe . On these grounds alone , we always prefer a peaceful relationship of mutually profitable cooperation . These critics say that the Omegans ' suspicion and hostility were justified in view of the aggressiveness of other life forms . This may be true , but it does not get to the heart of the matter . The central problem was that the Omegans refused to acknowledge the moral rights of creatures other than Omegans . Jut as twenty-secondcentury Christians can not believe that Jesus died to save Betas and Epsilons , just as Marxists do n't know what to think about economic determinism on other worlds , so the Omegans could not believe that their souls might migrate beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat other beings fairly , and , in fact , they had treated us viciously . Perhaps if the crisis had not come so quickly , some say , the Omegans might have adjusted their morality to include other life forms . But this would not have happened as long as those others did not share the belief of the Omegans. // Perhaps , some add , we would have come to share the religion of the Omegans . This is a lovely fantasy , indeed . If a religion is to be judged by its moral efficacy , the " religion " of the Omegans is the best we have ever encountered . But this is mere speculation . One does not change religions as one changes clothes . Earth has its religions already , and , for good or ill , we seem to be stuck with them . Then we should have left the Omegans alone , say the critics . But this is naive . No one gets left alone , on Earth or beyond . Either people get along , or they fight . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time , when war meant human beings facing human beings , the Omegans would have been unbeatable . Their firm belief in a perpetual reincarnation on Omega would have made them supremely courageous and persistent . But such qualities count for nothing against missiles . The weapons they had been able to develop within fifty years may have been good enough against Alpha , but not against Earth . The war , of course , was brief ? and , for the Omegans , devastating . Few faiths survive such catastrophes . The faith of the Omegans has not . Already , for the first time in the recorded history of Omega , questions are being raised , questions for which no one has answers . Whatever the Omegans may be in the future , it is clear that they will never be the same . Their past civilization will become a footnote to the depressing history of the universe , a footnote both beguiling and accusatory : it was the only truly moral civilization that has ever existed . Questions 1 . In " The Land of Certus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad via perception of the lights . Do you claim to have some knowledge of good and bad ? In what way did you gain this knowledge ? What , if anything , do you " see " when you see that something is good ? 2 . In making moral decisions , the Rechtsens are guided by the lights , the Linksens by the commands of their holy book , and Georges ( apparently ) by some principle to the effect that one ought to // increase pleasure and diminish pain . They differ as to what is the correct evidence of good and bad . Can you imagine some way in which this dispute might be resolved ? Can you imagine some sort of higher-level evidence that would convince everyone that , for example , the lights were indeed the true indicators of good and bad ? 3 . In observing that the green light illuminates the torture of Georges , the narrator of " Certus , " who had previously considered torture repulsive , decides that it is , after all , good . Presumably you continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously there is an intimate connection between feelings and value judgments . What is this connection ? Is judging something as bad fundamentally a matter of having negative feelings about it ? Or is it that one " sees " that something is bad and then feels negatively about it ? 4 . Perhaps when you try to decide what is good and what is bad , you turn to religious writings that you believe express the commands of God . Perhaps you are inclined to say that goodness and badness are a matter of what God commands and that the appearance of God would ( or will ) show everyone what is good and what is bad . If so , ask yourself the following questions : a . Is something made good by the mere fact that God commands it , quite apart from any reasons for His commanding it ? Or is it that God " sees " that a thing is good and commands it because it is good ? Would you be willing to say that an act of torture was good if God commanded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are good , how do you suppose that God decides what is good ? What does God see in something that makes it good ? 5 . According to the narrator of " Those Who Help Themselves , " the Omegans ' belief in reincarnation motivated them to be moral . In what way does this belief relate to morality ? What general considerations or principles did the Omegans employ in determining what is good and bad ? 6 . Compare and contrast the methods by which the Rechtsens and the Omegans determine what is good or bad , right or wrong . // 7 . The theme of " Those Who Help Themselves " suggests that there is frequently a conflict between self-interest and the dictates of morality , at least for the people of Earth . Give some everyday examples of this conflict , and try to explain what it is about morality that tends to conflict with one 's self-interest . 8 . If you believed in a morality like the Omegans ' , what sort of society and what sorts of moral principles would you endorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of society and the kinds of moral principles you now endorse ? DISCUSSION METAETHICS " The Land of Certus " raises two sorts of moral , or ethical , ques-tions . First , it brings up ? though without much emphasis ? nor-mative ethical questions . These are questions about what things are good or bad , right or wrong , about what things should or should not be done . The Rechtsens , the Linksens , Georges , and the people from the narrator 's land each have opinions about what is good and bad . It is obvious that there are differences of opinion among them , even if these differences are not elaborated . The following normative questions are noted : " Is torture ever permis-sible ? " " Ought men and women to be treated equally ? " " Is it per-missible to be intemperate in the pursuit of pleasure if no one else is harmed ? " Other normative questions , not mentioned in the story , include : " Is abortion wrong ? " " To what degree is one obli-gated to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom ? " * Second , " Certus " emphatically raises metaethical questions . These are questions concerning whether we can know which nor-mative ethical judgments are true and , if so , how we can know . Initially , it seems as if there are no troublesome metaethical isDISCUSSION 93 sues in Certus . Good things are those that glow green , bad things are those that glow red . If one says that something is good and that thing glows green , then the statement is true . Knowing good and bad is just a matter of looking at the colors . However , it turns out that there are others in Certus who say that the lights do not correctly mark the good and bad . The Linksens say that knowledge of good and bad is really to be found in their book . Georges disregards both the lights and the religious book and identifies good and bad with pleasure and pain respectively . Here we confront the issue of how moral questions are to be decided . Following the emphasis in " Certus , " we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of morality and moral judgments . What are we saying when we make a moral judgment ? Is there such a thing as the moral truth ? Can moral judgments be justified and , if so , in what way ? We shall focus on two rival metaethical theories : moral objectivism and moral subjectivism . It should be noted that the terms " moral " and " ethical " are synonymous and that they are similarly ambiguous . The terms " moral " and " ethical " as they shall be used in this section do not mean " good , " and their opposites are not " immoral " and " unethical . " Rather , their meaning is " pertaining to moral , or ethical , questions " ; their opposites are " nonmoral " and " nonethical . " In this usage , it is uncontroversial to say that Jesus , Marx , and Hitler all had moral , or ethical , theories ? that is , theories about what is good or bad , right or wrong . MORAL OBJECTIVISM AND MORAL SUBJECTIVISM The moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its negation , one of these judgments must be true and the other false . In this sense , moral judgments are analogous to judgments in the domain of science . We would all agree that where we have two statements like " There is life on Mars " and " There is no life on Mars , " one of these statements must be true and the other false . We know this , even if we do not know which of the statements is true and which is false . According to the moral objectivist , the same is the case with moral judgments . Where we have two judgments like " All abortion is wrong " and " Not all abortion // is wrong , " one of the judgments must be true and the other false . The moral objectivist says that of the various moral theories , at most one of these theories can be true , and the rest must be false . In this sense , conflicting moral theories are analogous to scientific theories . Where there are rival scientific theories about the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Of course , they may all be false ; perhaps none of them correctly describes the universe . But one and only one scientific theory could correctly describe the universe . In this sense , there is such a thing as the scientific truth . According to the moral objectivist , the various moral theories contradict one another , and at most only one of them could be true . One and only one moral theory could correctly describe the phenomena relevant to moral questions . In this sense , there is such a thing as the moral truth . Precisely what the phenomena are that moral theories purport to describe is a matter of debate among objectivists . Some have said that moral theories purport to describe the laws of God . Others have suggested that moral theories purport to describe the natural law , some special moral qualities , or some particular set of those characteristics to which scientific theories also refer . But all objectivists agree that moral theories are rival theories about some sort of moral phenomena . Many objectivists would claim to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to know at least that certain moral theories are false ? for instance , those that endorse human slavery , torture , or the extermination of some racial group . Other moral objectivists would claim that some moral theory must be true , but that they do not know which one is true . The moral subjectivist claims that there is no one correct answer to moral questions ; there is no such thing as the moral truth . Where we have a moral judgment and its negation , neither judgment need be false . Moral questions are not analogous to scientific questions ; rather , they are analogous to questions of taste . We all agree that there are questions of taste ? for example : " Is yellow prettier than blue ? " " Does apple pie taste better than cherry pie ? " Most of us would agree that when one person says , " This apple pie is good " and another says , " This apple pie is not good , " neither judgment need be false . In such cases , what is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but differing reactions // toward the pie . Analogously , according to the moral subjectivist , moral judgments express attitudes toward persons , actions , or events , rather than being descriptions of such things . When one person says , " All abortion is wrong " and another says , " Not all abortion is wrong , " each is expressing a different attitude toward abortion and neither judgment need be false . Moral goodness or badness , rightness or wrongness ? like prettiness , like deliciousness ? are " in the eye of the beholder . " Moral issues are fundamentally " subjective . " To elaborate further on moral subjectivism at this point would involve us in subtleties best reserved for later in the discussion . But the above explanation should give you a sense of what moral subjectivism is , and the position should seem to you a familiar one . It is dramatized in much existentialist literature : the universe contains no intrinsic values , so each individual must " invent " his or her own . It is presupposed by much of the current talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is thought , should deal only with factual matters , because matter of values are too subjective . AN ARGUMENT FOR MORAL SUBJECTIVISM Having outlined the theories of moral objectivism and moral subjectivism , let us now consider a line of argument that might lead one to reject moral objectivism and adopt some sort of moral subjectivist view . When we consider a scientific question , we do not always agree on the answer . But we do agree on what evidence would decide the issue . For example , we may not know whether there are intelligent creatures on a particular planet , but we do agree on what evidence would show that there are such creatures on that planet . With regard to questions of taste , however , there is no conceivable evidence that would resolve such issues to everyone 's satisfaction . There is no conceivable evidence that would demonstrate that yellow is prettier than blue or that apple pie tastes better than cherry pie . If moral questions are indeed analogous to scientific questions , then we ought to be able to specify what evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moral // subjectivist , we can not do this . There is no evidence that would demonstrate that abortion is right or wrong , that an equal distribution of goods is or is not better than competition for goods . Thus , says the subjectivist , moral questions can not be analogous to scientific questions . Instead , they are analogous to questions of taste . " The Land of Certus " explores the possibility of decisive moral evidence , and the story is slanted in favor of the moral subjectivist . In Certus , apparently , the good is clearly marked with a green light and the bad with a red light . Seemingly , there ought to be no moral disputes in Certus . But there are such disputes . Georges and some of the younger people claim that one ought to ignore the lights whenever they conflict with the principle that one ought to do what gives one pleasure . The Linksens abide by a religious book that sometimes contradicts what is indicated by the lights . The Linksens say that their book , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toward the end of the story , the narrator is shocked when the green light illuminates an act of torture , but decides that if the green light so indicates , then the act of torture must be good . Presumably , many readers formed the opposite conclusion : the act of torture would not be good no matter what the lights indicated . Here the subjectivist could issue the following challenge : Suppose that an act that you found personally repugnant were labeled as good by some law or by public opinion , or by some magical light as in Certus . Would you conclude that the act you find repugnant is good ? Or would you conclude that the act can not be good , since you find it repugnant ? Would n't you say the latter ? And does n't this indicate that morality is basically a matter of how you feel about things ? Many readers may have an ethic based on what they believe to be divine commands , and they may feel that this argument for moral subjectivism seems forceful only because it neglects religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Throughout history , our ethical beliefs have been reflections of what we believed to be the wishes of the gods , or God . No doubt , there are legitimate questions as to which religious writings , if any , correctly describe divine wishes . But , at most , such questions would justify one 's being a moral objectivist who doubts that one can know the moral truth . Subjectivists ask what // evidence would resolve all moral disputes . If an omnipotent , om niscient creator was revealed to all and was to make known what we were to do and not do , that would show everyone what things are good or bad , right or wrong . Some quasi-subjectivists have claimed that moral disputes are unresolvable , only because no God exists to " answer " moral ques tions . These quasi-subjectivists would not deny that the commands of such a God would show everyone what is right and wrong . But they say there is no God . In a world without God , there is no evidence that would resolve moral disputes . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described above and would deny that even the clear commands of a God would resolve all moral disputes . This is not to say that such a God could not force everyone to follow these com mands . But " might " is not necessarily " right . " The issue here is whether the clear commands of a God would result in a rational resolution of moral disputes . Moral subjectivists might begin an attack on the theist argument ment by asking a question that is still a live , if hoary , one in theology : Is something good because God commands it , or does God command something because it is good ? * Theists who say that something is good just because God com mands it are in an uncomfortable position . They are committed to the view that even if God advocated gratuitous , terrible acts of torture , such acts would necessarily be good . To theists who are willing to accept these consequences , subjectivists could say the following : Even if you would be willing to accept something as good just because God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not . These other theists would say that even God must have some satisfactory justification for a command if that command is to be good . This shows that the clear commands of God per se would not be the supposed evidence that would resolve all moral disputes . Theists who say that God commands something because it is good avoid having to say that a terrible act of torture would be good by the simple supposition of God 's commanding it . They can // say that torture is objectively bad , and God would n't command something that was bad . But this theistic position undercuts the theistic argument against moral subjectivism given above . That argument supposed that the clear commands of God would be the evidence that would resolve all moral disputes . But to say that God commands something because it is good supposes that God decides what is good or bad on the basis of some evidence . Now the theists must start all over again and specify what , if any , evidence would resolve all moral disputes ? including moral disputes be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the moral subjectivists could present us with some hypothetical , plausible , and not-too-offensive examples of a moral disagreement between a human being and God . An issue of this type is discussed in Chapter 2 , " God and the Problem of Suffering . " Some theists claim that at the time of creation , God had a choice : Either He could give human beings free will and the risk of un happiness , or He could make them inevitably happy creatures who lacked free will . According to many theists , God chose to give human beings free will . But surely we can imagine someone say ing to God : " I understand why You made the choice You did , but I think it was the wrong one . I think that happiness is more valuable than freedom . Had I been in Your place , I would not have given human beings the free will that has brought them so much pain . I would have created human beings who could not be other than happy . " Here , clearly , the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral dispute . What evidence could God introduce that would demonstrate to this dissenter that freedom is better than happiness ? Could there really be such evidence ? Is n't such a dis pute ultimately a matter of disagreement in attitude ? * The moral subjectivist claims that no evidence , even the reveDISCUSSION 99 lation of some divine law , would resolve our moral disputes . In the last analysis , what the individual approves of is pronounced " good , " and what does not meet approval is " bad . " Moral judgments , then , are basically expressions of one 's attitudes and feelings . MORAL SUBJECTIVISM RECONSIDERED If this argument for moral subjectivism seems forceful , note that this position still has not been stated very precisely . If we are to evaluate moral subjectivism properly , we need to describe it in greater detail . There have been some terribly implausible versions of moral subjectivism . It will be helpful to sketch a very crude version of moral subjectivism and then show how , and why , it has been altered over the last thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting that this refined theory of moral subjectivism bears a resemblance to a version of moral objectivism that is different from , and perhaps more plausible than , the type of objectivist theory indicated earlier . We shall also reconsider moral objectivism in this other form . One crude form of moral subjectivism claims that moral judgments or theories are simple descriptions of the speaker 's attitudes . The statement " X is right " means " I approve of X " ; the statement " X is wrong " means " I disapprove of X. " According to this theory , all sincere moral judgments are true . When one person says , " All abortion is wrong " and another says , " Not all abortion is wrong , " neither statement need be false because the second does not really contradict the first . One person is saying , " I ( John Smith ) disapprove of abortion " and the other , " I ( Mary Jones ) do not disapprove of all abortion . " These statements do not literally contradict each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward abortion . Both statements , if they are sincere reports of the speakers ' feelings , are true . That this version of moral subjectivism is implausible ? or , at least , incomplete ? as an account of our moral judgments can be seen by noting certain features of our moral discourse that are highlighted in the story " Those Who Help Themselves . " The people on Omega debate moral issues and come to considerable agreement . We on Earth may not reach so much agreement , but we // certainly do debate moral matters . We attempt to persuade others of our moral views and occasionally succeed . We have a saying : " There 's no disputing matters of taste . " Yet we dispute matters of morals . How can this be , if morality is simply a matter of taste or preference ? Earlier , we saw that subjectivists say that to make a moral judgment is to state a preference . One clear example of a statement of preference would be : " I prefer country living to city living . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an invitation to debate . If moral judgments are only statements of preference , how is it that they so often seem to be attempts to persuade , that they so often provoke debate ? " Those Who Help Themselves " assumes that there is at least a theoretical distinction between doing what is in one 's self-interest and doing what is morally right . In part , at least , this relates to the distinction between what is in one 's own interest and what is in the interests of others . On Omega , in practice , there is little real conflict in this matter . The moral efficacy of the Omegans ' belief in perpetual , random reincarnation is that it leads them to believe that in helping others they are helping themselves . On Earth , there is considerable conflict between a person 's own interests and that which is morally right or between one 's own interests and the interests of others . This conflict is not only external , but internal . That is , not only do people often recognize a conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a conflict between what they want for themselves and what they feel they morally ought to do . Is there any hint of the distinction between one 's self-interest and that which is morally right in the moral subjectivist theory described above ? If moral judgments are only statements of preference , what does morality per se have to do with conflicts in preferences ? If my moral judgments are simply statements of my preferences , how is it that I feel a conflict between my preferences and my morality ? How could there be a conflict between my preferences and my preferences ? These are forceful objections to the simple form of moral sub-jectivism presented earlier . Most present-day moral subjectivists have recognized the force of these criticisms and have attempted to emend subjectivism to meet them . Moral judgments , say these subjectivists , do not merely have the function of stating preferences . They also have the function of // attempting to influence the preferences and actions of others . The I-approve-of-it analysis of moral judgments is not adequate . The judgment " It is good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I approve of this ; you should approve of this as well ; you should do this sort of thing . " How one succeeds in affecting the preferences and actions of others is obvious enough . Often we can be shown that what we think we want is not what we really want . " You say you want to see that movie , but you would n't like it ; the reviews say it is a violent film , and you hate violence . " Also , most people have a considerable interest in gaining the approval of others . " We do n't do that sort of thing around here " is the kind of " statement " that influences people of all ages . If people at your dinner table said , " Please do n't eat the stringbeans with your fingers ; it 's disgusting , " you might well stop , without assuming that what you were doing was objectively bad . Furthermore , present-day subjectivists would say that moral preferences are a particular type of preference . One 's moral preferences express how one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they express general prescriptions , rules for human behavior . Moral preferences are not the I'd-like-to-get-this type of preference . Rather , they imply the message : I approve of this kind of human behavior ; let us all act in this sort of way . Moral preferences are one 's preferences from the standpoint of a hypothetical legislator for all human beings . A person 's preferred rules count as moral rules only if they are not prejudiced in favor of one 's particular circumstances . To propose moral rules is to imply that such rules should apply even if one were in the other person 's position . In the words of the eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant , moral judgments are " universalizable . " A person who , using imagination , discounts his or her particular circumstances , surveys the human condition , and decides what rules all human beings should follow is said to be taking the " moral point of view . " To express a moral preference is to express a preference from the moral point of view . In addition to " moral preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our personal preferences have to do with what we each want for ourselves . Our personal desires often conflict . Our desire to spend two weeks at the beach may conflict with our desire to save money for some new clothing . In an analogous way , // says the subjectivist , our moral preferences and our personal preferences may conflict . From the moral point of view , we may wish that people would keep their promises . From the personal point of view , we may wish to break a promise we find very inconvenient to keep . Thus it is that there is often a conflict between selfinterest and that which is morally right , says the subjectivist . This is not a matter of a clash between personal preferences and the dictates of some objective moral rules . Rather , it is a matter of a clash between personal preferences and moral preferences . The present-day moral subjectivist , then , says that moral judgments are not simply statements of preference . Moral judgments express one 's preferences as to the rules one would like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjectivist amount to something more than the patching up of a theory that states that morality and moral debate are fundamentally nonrational ? It would seem so . Most subjectivists feel that the recognition of the special nature of moral preferences , of the moral point of view , has important implications for ethical debate . Some objectivists have even claimed that this supposed emendation of the subjectivist theory actually yields a form of moral objectivism . Let us examine these claims . One can not deduce a particular morality from the definition of the moral point of view . This is as it should be . The definition , after all , is supposed to represent something implied by all moral judgments . Nonetheless , it is conceivable that many people make judgments which they claim to be moral judgments , but which they would not endorse if they seriously took the moral point of view . They may be proposing rules which they say are moral rules , but which they would not be willing to acknowledge if they were in the other person 's position . Such people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view that they are not really taking . Some philosophers have claimed that human psychology is such that persons who seriously took the moral point of view would all endorse the same set of rules . This claim implies a form of moral objectivism : only one moral theory is compatible with the moral point of view and the facts of human psychology . Moral subjectivDISCUSSION 103 ists deny that this is so . But most subjectivists do believe that many people would have to modify their moral judgments if they seriously took the moral point of view . Some people may endorse the segregation of blacks or of Jews . Suppose that such people were to learn that they themselves were of Negroid or Jewish extraction . Would they continue to hold their bigoted views ? In most cases , this seems doubtful . If so , then such people must admit that their views represent personal preferences rather than moral preferences . Some people are fortunate enough to make millions of dollars . They may endorse a survival-of-the-fittest morality and say : Let the poor fend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money and their ability to make more . Would they then say : I 'm not fit , let me perish ? Or would they say : How about a social welfare program ? If the latter , then their original judgments were not moral preferences but personal preferences . Would anything be gained by persuading people to admit that certain of their views constituted personal preferences and not moral preferences ? In some cases , no . Some people are content to be amoral . But many people care very much about morality . After all , to engage in moral dialogue is to engage in a kind of intellectual arbitration . As in any kind of arbitration , one may sometimes lose , but the arbitration procedure does offer one certain protections . To abandon morality would be to agree to let human relations be governed by whim and strength . This prospect bothers many people very much . Also , the psychology of most adults seems to be such that believing they are moral is crucial to their feelings of self-respect . Few adults like to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to adjust their morality to agree with their self-interest . But such adjustments are not really compatible with having a morality . In any case , the question at issue here is whether there can be a rational resolution of moral questions . Whether , and to what degree , people are willing to be moral , willing to act on their moral preferences rather than on their personal ones , is a very serious question , but it is also a quite different question from the one we are considering . In " Those Who Help Themselves , " the metaphysical beliefs of // the Omegans motivate them to take the moral point of view constantly . They believe in a perpetual , random reincarnation of souls that will eventually place each of them in different social positions and circumstances . They are motivated continuously to ask themselves : What if I were in the other person 's position ? Probably this is a question that most of us manage to avoid a good deal of the time . In the story , taking the moral point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether there ought to be competition or an equal distribution of goods , whether one ought to promote happiness over excellence , and so forth . Nonetheless , the story implies that people who really did take the moral point of view would be in close enough agreement that they would get along quite well . And , indeed , if human beings could come to this much agreement in their views , they might well be quite satisfied . Moral objectivists , of course , would say that the story presumes too little . Many subjectivists would say that it presumes too much . FROM THE MORAL POINT OF VIEW Perhaps it would be helpful to take a contemporary moral ? social issue and show how it is related to normative philosophical debates that make conscious reference to the moral point of view . We are all familiar with the issue of how the goods of a society ought to be distributed among its members . Should all the goods be distributed on the basis of competition ? Or should all the goods be distributed equally ? Or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the remaining goods be distributed on the basis of competition ? If the last , how much should the guaranteed minimum be ? One normative ethical theory that is favored by British philosophers is utilitarianism . The premise of utilitarianism is that the only thing valuable in itself is happiness and that a society ought to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number . The emphasis here is on " greatest happiness " rather than on " greatest number . " If the greatest total happiness in society would be achieved by , say , a competitive system that allocated most of the // goods to seventy-five percent of the members , rather than by a less competitive system that distributed goods more equally , then util itarianism would favor the first system . This is not to say that utilitarianism per se favors competition and unequal distribution . We can not derive a specific answer to the question of how goods ought to be distributed in a society from the utilitarian principle alone . We would also need factual infor mation about what social system would create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the case that utilitarianism does not insist upon a guaranteed minimum for all individuals . A number of philosophers have criticized utilitarianism as " un just " in this respect : they have said that a more acceptable nor mative theory would be one that insisted upon substantial guarantees for every individual . One of these critics is John Rawls , whose book Justice as Fairness* is much discussed by philosophers today . He has formulated a concise normative theory that he be lieves is preferable to utilitarianism , and he has defended his theory via an imaginative test that he claims is equivalent to taking the moral point of view . " Those Who Help Themselves " was written with Rawls in mind . But it should be noted that the re-marks that follow are such a simplification as to amount almost to a distortion of Rawls 's views . For instance , Rawls seems to claim that liberty is valuable in itself , quite apart from its effects on happiness . That claim shall be ignored . What we shall focus on is that part of Rawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distribution of goods on happiness . Rawls says that society should deviate from an equal distribu tion of goods only if , and only to the extent that , every member is at least a little better off , over time , under a system that distrib utes unequally . If , for example , a competitive system would pro-duce more goods and more happiness , then the competitive system would be acceptable ? but only if , and to the extent that , every individual gained something by such a competitive system . As with utilitarianism , no specific answer to the question of how goods ought to be distributed in a society can be derived from // Rawls 's principle . Again , we need information about benefits that might accrue through competition . But it is clear that Rawls 's principle insists on a relatively sizable guarantee for each individual , whereas the utilitarian principle does not insist on any . Rawls 's principle would seem more likely to lead to a more equal distribution of goods than would that of the utilitarian . What is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Rawls attempts to defend his principle with an appeal to the moral point of view . He asks us to imagine that we are about to enter life . We do not know what our interests and abilities will be ; we do not know what our position in society will be . We must choose some general normative principle that will guide us in determining what sort of social system we will have . According to Rawls , being in such a situation would be the literal equivalent of taking the moral point of view . Obviously , such a situation would be analogous to the situation on Omega , with the ? possibly important ? difference that each Omegan is already living a life and believes that there are a great number of lives to go . Rawls claims that in such a situation people would choose his principle rather than that of the utilitarian . His principle is the one most compatible with the moral point of view ( and the facts of human psychology ) . The utilitarians have responded by claiming that the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal standards of rationality . Suppose that you and nine others were offered one of two lotteries , each requiring a wager of ten dollars . In the first lottery ( subsidized by the Better Business Bureau , one might suppose ) , five of you will lose the ten dollars , and five of you will win one hundred dollars . In the second lottery ( not subsidized ) , all of you will get back five dollars , and five will receive an extra ten dollars , getting back a total of fifteen . Which lottery would you choose ? The first , of course . Similarly , suppose you were to " bet your life " on one of two societies . In the first society , ninetyfive percent of the people would be very happy , and five percent of the people very miserable . In the second society , fifty percent of the people would be mildly happy , and fifty percent mildly miserable . Which society would you choose ? The first , of course . Rawls 's principle , however , would favor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle that would always give the best " odds on happiness " would be the more rational by normal standards of rationality . But Rawls argues that persons wagering an entire lifetime would adopt the more conservative betting strategy . The idea of living one 's life in great misery would be such a fearful prospect that people would be willing to take lesser odds on happiness to ensure that they would not suffer great misery . " Those Who Help Themselves " imagines that all would insist on at least some guaranteed minimum but would differ as to the distribution of goods beyond that . " Apparently , those supporting the largest opposition party were gamblers : they were willing to risk the possibility of some misfortune in the next life for the possibility of gaining great wealth in this life . Those on the opposite end of the political spectrum were unwilling to gamble at all with their future lives : they wanted to be guaranteed an equal share of the wealth . Those who supported the majority party wanted some guarantees and some chances to gamble . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her future life , to risk being diseased , mentally defective , or hungry , and being without help . " You might discuss this problem with your friends . Do you agree with the utilitarian viewpoint or with Rawls ? Or can you formulate some other principle that you would prefer ? How close can you come to agreement with one another ? This , of course , is related to the broader question : Would those who seriously took the moral point of view come to complete or considerable agreement on their moral views ? Probably the only way to determine this is to continue our moral dialogues , but with greater philosophical clarity . In determining your moral preferences , try to make sure that you are taking the moral point of view . When you find that you and another person seem to disagree on an issue , try to conduct your discussion explicitly from the moral point of view . Perhaps this will not lead to greater agreement in your moral discussions . But the chances are that it will . // READINGS A. C. Ewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commands of God . ... I refer to the attempt to define ethical concepts in terms of religion by maintaining that to say something is good or right is to say that it is commanded by God . At first sight it may well seem that such a theory is refuted at once by the mere fact that agnostics and atheists can make rational judgments in ethics , but it will be replied that what even the atheist really has in mind when he thinks of obligation is some confused idea of a command , and that a command implies a commander and a perfect moral law a perfectly good commander on whose mind the whole moral law depends , so that the atheist is inconsistent in affirming the validity of the moral law and yet denying the existence of God . It may be doubted whether this argument , if valid , would make the theological statement an analysis of what the man meant and not rather of the logical consequences of what he meant , but there are other objections to such a definition . ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined in terms of the commands of God , God can not command anything because it is right or good , since this would only mean that He commanded it because He commanded it , and therefore there is no reason whatever for His commands , which become truly arbitrary . It would follow that God might just as rationally will that our whole duty should consist in cheating , torturing and killing people to the best of our ability , and that in that case it would be our duty to act in this fashion . ( b ) And why are we to obey God 's commands ? Because we ought to do so ? Since " we ought to do A " is held to mean " God commands t us to do A , " this can only mean that we are commanded by God to obey God 's commands , which supplies no further reason . Because we love God ? But this involves the assumptions that we ought to obey God if we love Him , and that we ought to love Him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // vicious circle be validated by once more referring to God 's commands . Because God is good ? This could only mean that God carries out His own commands . Because God will punish us if we do not obey Him ? This might be a very good reason from the point of view of self-interest , but self-interest can not , as we have seen , be an adequate basis for ethics . Without a prior conception of God being good or His commands being right God would have no more claim on our obedience than Hitler except that He would have more power to make things uncomfortable for us if we disobeyed Him than Hitler ever had , and that is not an ethical reason . A moral obligation can not be created by mere power and threat of punishment . No doubt if we first grant the fundamental concepts of ethics , the existence of God may put us under certain obligations which we otherwise would not have had , e.g. that of thinking of God , as the existence of a man 's parents puts him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were dead , but we can not possibly derive all obligations in this fashion from the concept of God . No doubt , if God is perfectly good , we ought to obey His will , but how can we know what His will for us is in a particular case without first knowing what we ought to do ? What I have said of course constitutes no objection to the belief in God or even to the view that we can have a valid argument from ethics to the existence of God , but these views can be held without holding that our ethical terms have to be defined in terms of God .... Nor is what I have said meant to imply that religion can have no important bearing on ethics , but I think its influence should lie more in helping people to bring themselves to do what would be their duty in any case and in influencing the general spirit in which it is done than in prescribing what our duty is . While it is quite contrary to fact to suggest that an agnostic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the former respects of religious belief , whether true or false , can not be denied to have been exceedingly strong . // C. L. Stevenson ( 1908-1979 ) , a subjectivist , discusses " disagreement in belief " versus " disagreement in interest . " ... Mr. G. E. Moore 's familiar objection about the open question is chiefly pertinent in this regard . No matter what set of scientifically knowable properties a thing may have ( says Moore , in effect ) , you will find , on careful introspection , that it is an open question to ask whether anything having these properties is good . It is difficult to believe that this recurrent question is a totally confused one , or that it seems open only because of the ambiguity of " good . " Rather , we must be using some sense of " good " which is not definable , relevantly , in terms of anything scientifically knowable . That is , the scientific method is not sufficient for ethics .... ... We must distinguish between " disagreement in belief " ( typical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disagreement in belief occurs when A believes p and B disbelieves it . Disagreement in interest occurs when A has a favourable interest in X , when B has an unfavourable one in it , and when neither is content to let the other 's interest remain unchanged . Let me give an example of disagreement in interest . A. " Let 's go to a cinema to-night . " B. " I do n't want to do that . Let 's go to the symphony . " A continues to insist on the cinema , B on the symphony . This is disagreement in a perfectly conventional sense . They ca n't agree on where they want to go , and each is trying to redirect the other 's interest . ( Note that imperatives are used in the example . ) It is disagreement in interest which takes place in ethics . When C says " This is good , " and D says " No , it 's bad , " we have a case of suggestion and counter-suggestion . Each man is trying to redirect the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since each may be willing to give ear to the other 's influence ; but each is trying to move the other nonetheless .... ... When two people disagree over an ethical matter , can they completely resolve the disagreement through empirical considerations , assuming that each applies the empirical method exhaustively , consistently , and without error ? READINGS III I answer that sometimes they can , and sometimes they can not .... Let 's return to the example where A and B could n't agree on a cinema or a symphony . The example differed from an ethical argument in that imperatives were used , rather than ethical judgments ; but was analogous to the extent that each person was endeavouring to modify the other 's interest . Now how would these people argue the case , assuming that they were too intelligent just to shout at one another ? Clearly , they would give " reasons " to support their imperatives . A might say , " But you know , Garbo is at the Bijou . " His hope is that B , who admires Garbo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows what play will be there . B may counter , " But Toscanini is guest conductor to-night , in an all-Beethoven programme . " And so on . Each supports his imperative ( " Let 's do so and so " ) by reasons which may be empirically established . To generalize from this : disagreement in interest may be rooted in disagreement in belief . That is to say , people who disagree in interest would often cease to do so if they knew the precise nature and consequences of the object of their interest . To this extent disagreement in interest may be resolved by securing agreement in belief , which in turn may be secured empirically . This generalization holds for ethics . If A and B , instead of using imperatives , had said , respectively , " It would be better to go to the cinema , " and " It would be better to go to the symphony , " the reasons which they would advance would be roughly the same . They would each give a more thorough account of the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest which was begun by the suggestive force of the ethical sentence . On the whole , of course , the suggestive force of the ethical statement merely exerts enough pressure to start such trains of reasons , since the reasons are much more essential in resolving disagreement in interest than the persuasive effect of the ethical judgment itself . Thus the empirical method is relevant to ethics simply because our knowledge of the world is a determining factor to our interests . But note that empirical facts are not inductive grounds from which the ethical judgment problematically follows .... If some112 MORAL PROOF AND MORAL PRINCIPLES one said " Close the door , " and added the reason " We 'll catch cold , " the latter would scarcely be called an inductive ground of the former . Now imperatives are related to the reasons which support them in the same way that ethical judgments are related to reasons . Is the empirical method sufficient for attaining ethical agreement ? Clearly not . For empirical knowledge resolves disagreement in interest only to the extent that such disagreement is rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of this sort . For instance : A is of a sympathetic nature , and B is n't . They are arguing about whether a public dole would be good . Suppose that they discovered all the consequences of the dole . Is n't it possible , even so , that A will say it 's good , and B that it 's bad ? The disagreement in interest may arise not from limited factual knowledge , but simply from A 's sympathy and B 's coldness . Or again , suppose , in the above argument , that A was poor and unemployed , and that B was rich . Here again the disagreement might not be due to different factual knowledge . It would be due to the different social positions of the men , together with their predominant self-interest . When ethical disagreement is not rooted in disagreement in belief , is there any method by which it may be settled ? If one means by " method " a rational method , then there is no method . But in any case there is a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , where disagreement was due to A 's sympathy and B 's coldness . Must they end by saying , " Well , it 's just a matter of our having different temperaments " ? Not necessarily . A , for instance , may try to change the temperament of his opponent . He may pour out his enthusiasms in such a moving way ? present the sufferings of the poor with such appeal ? that he will lead his opponent to see life through different eyes . He may build up , by the contagion of his feelings , an influence which will modify B 's temperament , and create in him a sympathy for the poor which did n't previously exist . This is often the only way to obtain ethical agreement , if ! there is any way at all . It is persuasive , not empirical or rational ; but that is no reason for neglecting it . There is no reason to scorn it , either , for it is only by such means that our personalities are able to grow , through our contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments are universalizable prescriptions . Here he discusses to what degree fundamental moral disagreement is compatible with universalizability and the facts of human psychology . For the sake of a name , let me refer to the type of doctrine which I put forward in The Language of Morals , and still hold , as " universal prescriptivism " ? a combination , that is to say , of universalism ( the view that moral judgments are universalizable ) and prescriptivism ( the view that they are , at any rate typically , prescriptive ) . ... Now , as I hope to show , the combination ... is sufficient to establish the rationality of morals , or the possibility of cogent moral arguments .... In order to illustrate this use again , let us suppose that we are having an argument with a man who maintains that a black skin , by itself , is a sufficient ground for discriminating against its possessor . We tell him , and he , being a credulous person , believes the following story . The Soviet Institute of Race Relations ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts ) has just succeeded in breeding a new kind of bacillus , which Soviet agents are at this very moment broadcasting in areas of racial conflict throughout the world . This bacillus is very catching , and the symptom of the disease which it induces is that , if the patient 's skin was white , it turns permanently black , and vice versa . Now when the person with whom we are arguing has absorbed the implications of this story , we ask him whether he still thinks that skin-colour by itself is a sufficient ground for moral discrimination . It is unlikely that he will go on saying that it is ; for then he will have to say that if he catches the disease the former blacks who have also had it will have acquired the right to oppress him , and all his formerly white friends . What do we learn from this simple piece of science fiction ? What we have got our opponent to do by this innocent deception is to perform an intellectual operation which , if he had really been wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception . This operation is to consider the hypothetical case in which he himself has lost the quality which he said was a sufficient ground for discrimination , and his present victims have gained it ? and to consider this hypothetical case as if it were actual . There are two stages in the process of universalization . The first is passed when we have found a universal principle , not containing proper names or other singular terms , from which the moral judgment which we want to make follows , given the facts of our particular situation . This stage is comparatively easy to pass , even for the proponent of the most scandalous moral views . It is passed , for example , by adducing the principle that it is all right for black people to be oppressed by white people . But the next stage is more difficult . It is necessary , not merely that this principle should be produced , but that the person who produces it should actually hold it . It is necessary not merely to quote a maxim , but ( in Kantian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is here that prescriptivity , the second main logical feature of moral judgements , makes its most decisive appearance . For willing it to be a universal law involves willing it to apply even when the roles played by the parties are reversed . And this test will be failed by all maxims or principles which look attractive to oppressors and persecutors on the first test . It will indeed be found that , if we apply these two tests , both founded on the logical , formal features of moral terms , we shall be able to sort out , in the field of race relations at least , the grounds of discrimination which we are really prepared to count as morally relevant from those which we are not . From this satisfactory conclusion , however , there is , as we have seen , a way of escape for the sufficiently determined racialist . It remains to illustrate , in terms of the present example , what price he has to pay for his escape . Let us suppose that there is a racialist the mainspring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us suppose that the source of this horror is not any belief about the consequences , social or biological , of miscegenation . That is to say , i he is not moved by alleged facts about the weakening of the human stock by mating between people of different colours , or about the unsatisfactory life lived by people of mixed descent , or by anything of that kind . If these were his grounds , we could argue with him in a scientific way , trying to show that the offspring of mixed marREADINGS 115 riages are just as likely to be vigorous and intelligent as those of other marriages ; or that any bad social effects of miscegenation would be removed if he and people like him abandoned their attempts to enforce a colour bar . Let us suppose , however , that his grounds are not these , but simply a horror of the very idea of a black man mating with a white woman . This can not be touched by any scientific or factual argument of the sort described . And it may well be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to have a rigid colour bar ; and that if this is enforced , and leads to resentment , other repressive measures will be necessary for the maintenance of public order , and thus we shall have the whole apparatus of racial repression . If this is true , then it will be hard for us to argue with this man . He detests miscegenation so much that he is prepared to live in a police state in order to avoid it . And he must be prepared for more than this . He must , if he is going to universalize his moral judgements , be prepared that he himself should not merely live in a police state , but live in it in the same conditions as he is now prepared to make the blacks live in ? conditions which are getting steadily worse . He must be prepared that he should be subject to arbitrary arrest and maltreatment just on grounds of skin colour , and to butchery if he tries , in collaboration with his fellows , to protest . Now it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things in order to avoid miscegenation . But they are surely very few . The repression happens because these few people have on their side a multitude of other people who are not prepared at all to suffer thus , but who have not really thought through the argument . They think , perhaps , that all will be well without too much repression ; or that blacks do not mind being treated like this as much as whites would ; or that there is a scientific basis for belief in racial superiority ? or some of the many other things that racialists tend to believe . All these beliefs can perhaps be refuted severally by scientists and others without any help from the philosopher ; but they are apt , collectively , to form an amalgam in the minds of racialists which makes into allies of the fanatic many people who are not , in themselves , in the least fanatical . The contribution of the philosopher is to take this amalgam apart , deposit such beliefs as are open to scientific refutation in the in-trays of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , exhibit the prescriptive remainder of racialism for what it is ? something that fanatics may hold but which the bulk of a people ? even a people as hard-pressed as the white South Africans ? never will . ... In all cases the principle is the same ? am I prepared to accept a maxim which would allow this to be done to me , were I in the position of this man ... and capable of having only the experiences , desires , &c.,; of him ... ? It may be objected that not all people will follow this mode of reasoning which I have been suggesting .... no doubt there are some white South Africans ( a few ) who will be quite unmoved by being told that they are causing the Bantu to suffer . It seems that I am required to say what has gone wrong in such cases . A number of different things may have gone wrong . The commonest is what we call insensitivity or lack of imagination .... these people are not paying attention to the relevant similarities between themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though fully aware of what they are doing to their victims , they are not reasoning morally about it . That is to say , they are not asking themselves whether they can universalize their prescriptions ; though they may make play with the moral words which they have heard other people use , they are not , in their own thinking , using these words according to the logical rules which are implicit in their meaning . And there are other possibilities , too numerous to mention here , which have been examined in the body of this book . It may be asked : What is to be done about this ? Can the philosopher , in particular , do anything about it ? When South African believers in white supremacy read this book , will they at once hasten to repeal the pass laws and make the blacks their political equals ? This is highly unlikely ; and in any case they will not read the book . To get people to think morally it is not sufficient to tell them how to do it ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And this is not the province of the philosopher . It is more ? likely that enlightened politicians , journalists , radio commentators , preachers , novelists , and all those who have an influence on public opinion will gradually effect a change for the better ? given that events do not overtake them . Perhaps people in areas of racial conflict can be , in the end , brought to think of the resemblances // between themselves and members of the other races as morally relevant , and of the differences as morally irrelevant . Perhaps , even , they may learn to cultivate their imaginations . But this much can be claimed for philosophy , that it is sometimes easier to bring something about if we understand clearly what it is we are trying to do . John Rawls , from Justice as Fairness . My aim is to present a conception of justice which generalizes and carries to a higher level of abstraction the familiar theory of the social contract .... In order to do this we are not to think of the original contract as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular form of government . Rather , the guiding idea is that the principles of justice for the basic structure of society are the object of the original agreement . They are the principles that free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association . These principles are to regulate all further agreements ; they specify the kinds of social cooperation that can be entered into and the forms of government that can be established . This way of regarding the principles of justice I shall call justice as fairness . Thus we are to imagine that those who engage in social cooperation choose together , in one joint act , the principles which are to assign basic rights and duties and to determine the division of social benefits . Men are to decide in advance how they are to regulate their claims against one another and what is to be the foundation charter of their society . Just as each person must decide by rational reflection what constitutes his good , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to pursue , so a group of persons must decide once and for all what is to count among them as just and unjust . The choice which rational men would make in this hypothetical situation of equal liberty , assuming for the present- that this choice problem has a solution , determines the principles of justice . In justice as fairness the original position of equality corresponds to the state of nature in the traditional theory of the social // contract . This original position is not , of course , thought of as an actual historical state of affairs , much less a primitive condition of culture . It is understood as a purely hypothetical situation .... ... Among the essential features of this situation is that no one knows his place in society , his class position or social status , nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities , his intelligence , strength , and the like . I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ignorance . This ensures that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged in the choice of principles by the outcome of natural chance or the contingency of social circumstances . Since all are similarly situated and no one is able to design principles to favor his particular condition , the principles of justice are the result of a fair agreement or bargain .... One feature of justice as fairness is to think of the parties in the initial situation as rational and mutually disinterested . This does not mean that the parties are egoists , that is , individuals with only certain kinds of interests , say in wealth , prestige , and domination . But they are conceived as not taking an interest in one another 's interests . They are to presume that even their spiritual aims may be opposed , in the way that the aims of those of different religions may be opposed .... ... once the principles of justice are thought of as arising from an original agreement in a situation of equality , it is an open question whether the principle of utility would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view themselves as equals , entitled to press their claims upon one another , would agree to a principle which may require lesser life prospects for some simply for the sake of a greater sum of advantages enjoyed by others . Since each desires to protect his interests , his capacity to advance his conception of the good , no one has a reason to acquiesce in an enduring loss for himself in order to bring about a greater net balance of satisfaction . In the absence of strong ands. lasting benevolent impulses , a rational man would not accept a basic structure merely because it maximized the algebraic sum of advantages irrespective of its permanent effects on his own basic rights and interests . Thus it seems that the principle of utility is incompatible with the conception of social cooperation among // equals for mutual advantage . It appears to be inconsistent with the idea of reciprocity implicit in the notion of a well-ordered society . Or , at any rate , so I shall argue . I shall maintain instead that the persons in the initial situation would choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assignment of basic rights and duties , while the second holds that social and economic inequalities , for example inequalities of wealth and authority , are just only if they result in compensating benefits for everyone , and in particular for the least advantaged members of society . These principles rule out justifying institutions on the gounds that the hardships of some are offset by a greater good in the aggregate . It may be expedient but it is not just that some should have less in order that other may prosper . But there is no injustice in the greater benefits earned by a few provided that the situation of persons not so fortunate is thereby improved . The intuitive idea is that since everyone 's wellbeing depends upon a scheme of cooperation without which no one could have a satisfactory life , the division of advantages should be such as to draw forth the willing cooperation of everyone taking part in it , including those less well situated . Yet this can be expected only if reasonable terms are proposed ....        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
