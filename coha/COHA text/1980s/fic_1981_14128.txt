Part of a neighborhood bar in San Francisco on a slow night . Bar , tables . A jukebox is playing a vocal version of " Love Is a Many Splendored Thing " and the Man is dancing unhappily with the Woman . She is drunk , and he wishes he had n't asked . She is approaching middle age and he is past it , a gray and sallow sixty . They are the only customers in the bar . The music stops . She runs her hand through his hair , eyes closed . WOMAN Now , that was nice . ( The man steps back and she almost falls . ) MAN Yeah . Great . WOMAN What else can we play ? Wait , just wait . ( She weaves toward the jukebox and studies it for a moment , her wan face lit by the garish lights . The man takes his chance and moves quickly back to his seat at the bar . The bartender comes to him and they talk , shaking their heads . ) WOMAN ( Brightly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Chances Are . " ( She turns , sees the man has deserted her , stands mournfully alone a moment , shrugs , and then climbs back on her stool at the other end of the bar . Buddy enters , looks around . The woman smiles at him with bleary friendliness . Buddy calls outside. ) p. 3 BUDDY Hey , Frazier ! Come on ! ( No answer . ) I 'm through , pal ! Come on ! ( Frazier enters . He looks around . ) FRAZIER Great . BUDDY You got other ideas ? Other great bars in San Francisco you know about ? ( Frazier sighs , shakes his head . ) Let 's have a drink , and forget it . ( To bartender . ) Hey pal ! ( They go to the bar . As he passes the woman , Buddy takes a look , makes a face and shudders . They sit . Buddy waves to the bartender . ) Two stiff drinks . Doubles . ( To Frazier . ) Brandy , okay ? FRAZIER Sure . BUDDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy , and I want to see you break a fresh bottle . BARTENDER Okay . BUDDY Straight , water on the side . BARTENDER Okay . BUDDY And leave the bottle up where we can see it . BARTENDER Okay ! ( He goes behind the bar , muttering . ) Jerk . BUDDY ( To man at bar . ) Hey , sport . ( The man nods back , wanly. ) p. 4 FRAZIER How did we get into that place , anyhow ? BUDDY We saw the sign . You had to go in . FRAZIER Rhapsody Round-Up . BUDDY Rhapsody Round-Up . FRAZIER Yeah . BUDDY Yeah . FRAZIER You got around all right . BUDDY You pay , you dance . That 's life . FRAZIER Oh ? BUDDY Was n't so bad . Wait until you see the Marshall Islands . FRAZIER I thought you had n't been there . BUDDY No , but I was on Guam for a week , and I heard . Sun . Sand . Gooney birds . And that 's it . Tough duty . Rhapsody Round-Up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BUDDY Sure . This is what we protect , on the Marshall Islands . ( Buddy moves to the jukebox . Frazier follows . ) FRAZIER Yeah , I see . BUDDY There 's hope for you yet . ( Pause . ) You know why I got you an overnight pass out of that processing center ? p. 5 FRAZIER No , but thanks a lot . I appreciate it . BUDDY I like you . Why do I like you ? Because you 're a dumbass college kid , and everything else that 's stupid , and God knows you 're the worst-looking soldier ever drafted , and as far as the Army is concerned , for a long time you ai n't going to be able to find your butt with both hands , but you 're a clean slate . I like that . Guys like you got so much to learn , only an old-time . R. A. bastard like me can shape you up , before you sit on your bayonet . Now . Why did n't you go to O.C.S. ? ( Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to be an officer . BUDDY Afraid of responsibility . Okay . Get in , get out . FRAZIER Right . BUDDY So you end up in the Marshall Islands . FRAZIER Well , so do you . BUDDY Yeah , but I been other places first . ( Pause . ) A great war , when I was a young soldier . Riding to Berlin , with Patton . Smoked cigarette once , with Ike . Japan , two years . General MacArthur , Mount Fuji , lots of nookie . Iceland , well . All over the U.S. and this whole damn world , before I 'm through . I 'll see it all . p. 6 FRAZIER And know the score . BUDDY You bet your ass . You ca n't fool me , college boy . For instance , you got a big fancy vocabulary , even though you do n't use it . You do n't want to show up the dumb soldier with your choice and luminous array of verbal artillery . FRAZIER Hey . BUDDY So I know a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to this . When I came into the American Army in 1944 , there was n't any word of any kind anywhere , for that force . That power . It took hold of me , and it shook the shit right out of me . And I said , God damn , this is it . This is real . This is where I belong . Where words are nothing . Where what happens , happens , and no two damn ways about it ! The biggest , the best , the greatest game there is . So I play it . ( Pause . ) That make sense ? FRAZIER I see it does to you . BUDDY The soldier 's game . Ai n't no word for it . You just play it , and because it 's so real , you love it . See ? ( The bartender brings the bottle of brandy . He shows the Hennessy label to a still-skeptical Buddy . ) It says Hennessy . ( The bartender breaks the seal , opens the bottle . ) It looks like Hennessy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glass , like a French wine waiter . Buddy nods , picks it up , sniffs it . ) It is Hennessy . So run a tab . ( The bartender pours the drinks , moves away . ) And put it on top of the bar , where I can see that it stays Hennessy . ( Muttering , the bartender puts the bottle of brandy on the bar . Buddy warms the brandy with both hands , sniffing it with practiced pleasure . Frazier does the same . ) And I know what you 're thinking . If I 'm so smart and know-it-all , how come I could n't get us laid tonight ? p. 7 FRAZIER I did n't say it . BUDDY Rhapsody Round-Up was a bust . I got to have me something decent or nothing . So what the hell . Do n't get doleful . That 's a good word , right ? FRAZIER ( Smiling . ) Right . BUDDY Do n't get morose . That 's a good word , right ? FRAZIER A very good word . BUDDY Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? FRAZIER ( Laughing . ) Terrific . BUDDY Win or lose . Here 's to it . FRAZIER Skoal . BUDDY Butts up . ( They clink glasses and drink . The woman passes by , on an erratic course to the ladies ' room . She goes by close to them and brushes Frazier 's shoulder . He looks after her with interest , starts to get up . ) No , no , Frazier . Jesus Christ . FRAZIER Why not ? Marshall Islands tomorrow . Sun , sand , and gooney birds . It 's going to be a long time . BUDDY You want to spend it in the infirmary ? FRAZIER Oh . ( He sits down. ) p. 8 BUDDY I see I got ta teach you everything . FRAZIER You 've  --  uh  --  you 've had venereal disease  --  uh  --  BUDDY Once or twice . FRAZIER Playing the game . BUDDY What you want , young soldier , is something decent . Okay ? FRAZIER If you say so . Where do we get something decent ? BUDDY We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the doorway . They stand there undecided . ) We blew it in that nothing dance hall . So we forget it tonight . We conserve energy . Skoal . FRAZIER ( Glumly . ) Butts up . ( They drink . Buddy yawns , stretches . The bartender moves to the end of the bar closest to the door . ) BARTENDER ( To Felicia and Teresa . ) Ladies welcome . Plenty of room tonight . ( Buddy sits up quickly . ) BUDDY ( To Frazier . ) Well , wait a minute . Wait just a minute . ( He smiles and waves his hand merrily . Teresa smiles back and giggles . She tugs at Felicia 's arm and they finally come into the bar , sitting at a table next to Buddy and Frazier . Teresa , young , voluptuous , wears a peasant blouse and a loud , patterned skirt . Felicia , older , is dressed modestly . At the bar , the man looks at Felicia with interest. ) p. 9 FRAZIER Well , what do you think ? BUDDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort . ( He moves quickly to the bar and whispers to the bartender who shakes then nods his head . No . He does n't know who they are . Yes . Buddy can table-hop , dance . The man slides off his barstool with the same idea . The woman passes , coming back from the ladies ' room . Buddy takes her by the arm and steers her between him and the man . ) BUDDY ( To man . ) Hey , pal ! ( To woman . ) Hey , honey ! . You know my fine friend here ? WOMAN Sure . We was dancing a minute ago . MAN Look , fellow , I 'm busy . BUDDY How about that ? I figures you two 'd hit it off . Hey , bartender , give my two friends a drink on me right away . MAN Now wait a minute  --  WOMAN That 's real sweet of you , thanks ! MAN Well , thanks . BUDDY No , no , friend . It 's my pleasure . Enjoy yourself . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but well-muscled bully . Buddy turns to Teresa and Felicia , gives Frazier a wink , and moves in . ) Ladies , good evening . My pal and I would like nothing better this evening than the pleasure of buying you both a nice drink . Are you agreeable ? Yes ? No ? Maybe ? ( Teresa and Felicia smile. ) p. 10 BUDDY I know we 're not formally acquainted , ladies , and that 's the truth , and as you plainly see , my pal and me , we 're just soldiers , plain old dog-face G.I. 's , defenders of the United States . And that 's it . So what 'll you have ? ( Pause . Then Teresa and Felicia burst into giggles . ) Got your funny bones , I see . Just a joker , that 's all I am . But I can sure buy you both that drink , and even play us all some songs on that jukebox . So how about it ? ( The same pause , the same burst of giggles . Buddy sighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ladies ? ( The same pause , the same burst of giggles . ) Well , fuck this . ( Disgusted , Buddy stalks back to the table , speaking to the man as he goes . ) Your turn , sport . ( But now Frazier is up . He moves to their table . ) FRAZIER ( Softly . ) Uh , buenas tardes . Habla usted espanol ? ( Both girls smile . ) TERESA Si . FELICIA Si . ( Frazier turns to Buddy . ) FRAZIER Got it ? BUDDY ( Beaming . ) Oh , ho ! Bien , bien , muy-whooey bien ! ( He moves back to the table . ) How much Spanish you know , Frazier ? p. 11 FRAZIER Not much . ( To the girls . ) Un poco ? Un poco ? ( Both girls smile and nod . ) TERESA Si . FELICIA Si . BUDDY Ask them about a drink . Come on , come on , soldier . FRAZIER Well , let 's see now . Ah BUDDY Hell , I can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinko , ne ? Ah , musico ? El drinko ? Dancey-dancey ? ( Both girls laugh . Felicia smiles at Frazier . Teresa 's eyes are on Buddy . ) TERESA Si . FELICIA Si . BUDDY Well , you damn right ! Now we 're moving . Hey , bartender ! BARTENDER ( Smiling . ) What 'll it be , folks ? BUDDY Frazier , how you say Hennessy brandy in Spanish ? FRAZIER Well TERESA Beer . FELICIA Beer . BUDDY Yeah , well , there you go . Two beers , bartender , and two double Hennessy brandies. p. 12 BARTENDER Drafts ? BUDDY Right . BARTENDER Sure thing . ( Buddy turns to the girls , beaming , very excited . ) BUDDY Now , the drinks are on the way , let 's see what we can do about a little musico , ne ? ( He points , with enormous emphasis , at the jukebox.Teresa smiles demurely , gets up quickly . Buddy ushers her to the jukebox , singing as he follows her . ) How 'm I doing , hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see , ahwhat 's your name honey ? What 's your sweet fat little juicy old name . Hey , Frazier , how do you ask TERESA ( Grins . ) Teresa . BUDDY Well , Teresa , my name is Buddy . You Teresa , me Buddy . Okay . TERESA Okay . BUDDY ( Puts his arm around her shoulders . ) Now , let 's see what we got here . ( They look at the songs on the jukebox . ) FRAZIER ( To Felicia . ) Buenas tardes . FELICIA Buenas tardes . Sientese , por favor . FRAZIER Gracias . ( He sits , somewhat formally . They look around a moment , then Felicia smiles and then they both smile. ) p. 13 BUDDY ( Dropping coins in the jukebox . ) Here we go . ( The jukebox blares out " Love Is a Many Splendored Thing . " Grinning , Buddy takes Teresa in his arms and they dance , close . ) FRAZIER ( Fumbling for his Spanish . ) Well , let 's see now . Ahah FELICIA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senorita ? FELICIA Senora . Me llamo Felicia . Mucho gusto en conocerie . FRAZIER Felicia . Ah , bonito . Bonito . FELICIA Gracias . ( They smile , formally still , but with warmth . The bartender brings the drinks .

God bless you , Frazier , you little devil . And God bless Buddy , who just might get his rocks off after all . Yes , sir ! A toast to old Spain ! Ole ! ( Trying to make out what he says , the girls follow his motion and all clink glasses and laugh . They all drink . At the bar , the woman moves away from the man , insulted , dropping her purse and picking it up. ) p. 14 WOMAN Well , I 'm sorry . I 'm really very sorry . ( Muttering , she goes to her stool at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She slips her arm around Buddy 's waist , and puts down her glass . ) BUDDY My pinto bean . Dancey-dancey encore , ne ? ( Teresa giggles and nods happily . Buddy grabs her and they dance out onto the floor again . We hear " Love Is a Many Splendored Thing " again , but softly now , played by an orchestra , gently . ) FRAZIER ( Slowly . ) AhFelicia , habla ingles ? Habla ingles ?

( He winks and rolls his eyes . Teresa has both arms wrapped around him . She is breathing into his ear . She is melting against him . Buddy must call time out .

BUDDY ( Beaming . ) You better believe it . I mean sure . Si si si . Now ? TERESA OhahSi , ahora . BUDDY What the hell . Now . Right now . ( Teresa nods her head happily . Buddy puts down his drink , hops over to Felicia and Frazier , breaks them up , pushes Felicia toward Teresa , takes Frazier aside . ) FRAZIER Hey , what 's the idea ? I finally get to dance and you break it up ? BUDDY Baby , you 'll dance later . Right now we 're going home . FRAZIER Are you nuts ? Oh . You mean to their house ? BUDDY That or a hotel , we 'll see . A few bucks apiece and we can die happy . That Teresa is hot to trot So am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . Teresa is whispering quickly to Felicia , who turns and looks at Frazier . She smiles a trifle sadly , and nods her head . ) FRAZIER Well BUDDY Make up your mind . Think about the Marshall Islands .

How 'm I doing , hey , hey ! Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum ! ( They make a conga line and start singing and dancing out of the bar . Teresa sees something outside . She grabs Buddy by the arm , pulling him away from the door , looking for a back way out . ) TERESA No ! No ! BUDDY What 's this ? What 's the matter ? TERESA Hermano ! Broder ! FRAZIER What 's she saying ? BUDDY Got me . Honey , take it easy . TERESA ( To Felicia . ) No ils a venir esta nodre . ( To Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no think he come here ! Take me someplace ! Ah , hermano ! BUDDY Wait a minute ! Hermano who ? Herman who ? TERESA No , broder ! Broder ! BUDDY Herman Broder ? That it ? Listen , honey , whatever his name , anybody give us trouble now , I 'll take him apart . TERESA Eh ! ( The confusion is suddenly stilled . In the door stands Francisco Esteban , a small , thin man , of indeterminate age . He is dresed in cheap clothes , immaculately cleaned and pressed , worn with a flair , and he stands ramrod straight . His long black hair is ornately combed . Teresa swears softly in Spanish . Felicia sighs and looks meekly at the floor. ) p. 20 FRAZIER Buddy . Hermano means brother . ( Esteban walks slowly into the bar . ) ESTEBAN Good evening . BUDDY Oh , fuck . ESTEBAN How do you do ? BUDDY ( To Teresa . ) Honey , this guy your brother ? TERESA ( Hissing . ) Si ! ( Esteban nods to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , seats them formally , and then turns to the two soldiers . ) ESTEBAN Gentlemen , will you sit with us ? BUDDY Thanks . We were just on our way out . ESTEBAN I cordially invite you . BUDDY Some other time . ESTEBAN ( Sternly . ) Please , sir ! FRAZIER ( To Esteban . ) Thank you very much . ( To Buddy . ) Face it . BUDDY Jeez-zus . ( He slumps down next to Teresa , who presses against him and clamps a hot hand on his knee . Frazier holds a chair for Felicia , and sits next to her . Esteban gestures to the bartender. ) p. 21 ESTEBAN ( Standing . ) Whatever the ladies and gentlemen were having , please bring again . What were you drinking , gentlemen ? BUDDY Brandy . American brandy . ESTEBAN I will have that as well . And the bill is mine . Thank you . ( At the bar , the woman hears Esteban 's voice . ) WOMAN Hey , Francisco ! Yoo-hoo ! ESTEBAN ( Gravely . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over but he turns away from her brusquely . She sighs and goes back to her drink . ) My name is Francisco Esteban . What is yours , gentlemen ? BUDDY I 'm Buck Jones . ESTEBAN ( Shaking his hand . ) Mr. Jones , I am pleased to meet you . And you sir ? BUDDY He 's Flash Gordon . ESTEBAN Mr. Gordon , I am pleased FRAZIER No , not really . My name is Frazier Davenport . ESTEBAN Oh . Mr. Davenport , I am pleased to meet you . FRAZIER ( Shaking his hand . ) And I am pleased to meet you , Mr. Esteban . ( Esteban smiles at him , politely . Buddy scowls . The bartender brings the drinks and sets them down. ) p. 22 BARTENDER Draft beer for the ladies . American Hennessy brandy for the gents . Right ? Right . ( Esteban watches him carefully , as if as the head of the table , he is personally responsible for each drink . He picks up his brandy . ) ESTEBAN Gentlemen , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRAZIER Thank you very much , Mr. Esteban . ( Frazier nods to Felicia , who smiles sadly at him . They all drink . Teresa presses Buddy 's leg under the table , and drinks greedily . Esteban spills some of his brandy , betraying nervousness . His youth is now evident . He is under twenty . Buddy grins . ) BUDDY That 's a man 's drink , sonny . Use both hands . ( He slips an arm around Teresa 's shoulders . She presses against him , glaring at Esteban . Esteban drinks again , this time not spilling any of the brandy . He puts it down and faces them . ) ESTEBAN ( Still standing . ) A good drink is a fine thing , gentlemen , no ? BUDDY Yes , But there are better things . Right , Teresa ? TERESA Si ! FRAZIER We appreciate your hospitality , Mr. Esteban. p. 23 ESTEBAN Thank you . I am pleased . BUDDY You 're pleased , we 're pleased , hooray . ( He drinks , looks at Frazier , hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with this very long . Esteban lifts his brandy slowly as if daring his hand to shake , takes a deep drink . He sets it down equally deliberately , and clears his throat . ) Somebody give him a cough drop . FRAZIER Buddy . BUDDY This 'll take all night . ESTEBAN Gentlemen , do you see that woman at the bar ? BUDDY Friend of yours ? FRAZIER Yes , we see her . ESTEBAN She is not a proper woman . Not always prostitute , you comprehend , but still not a proper woman . Nightly I slept with her last week , several times . Well , I was that way , you know . Once I paid her . BUDDY And after that she paid you , right ? FRAZIER Buddy . BUDDY Look , what kind of a fuck-headed situation  --  FRAZIER Come on , Buddy ! BUDDY All right ! So what about her ? ESTEBAN She is a good person . A good person , but you see , she will do that with anyone . ( He clears his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not speak of her lightly . And please do not be uneasy about the women . They do not speak English . I do not embarrass them . ( Pause . ) No , not a pleasant woman , but please , I do not speak of her in judgment . How could I ? I went to her myself . Nevertheless , she is what she is . I do not respect her . It is sad , but that is the way you have it . You gentlemen understand me ? p. 24 FRAZIER I think so . BUDDY That means keep talking , which you 're gon na do . ESTEBAN Now . ( He sits . ) I have been three years in your wonderful country . Since I have come , I have learn the language well and work very hard . Last month , I send for my sister , youngest of our family . Gentlemen , let me present my sister , Teresa Maria Consuelo Esteban . ( Teresa glares at him . She runs her hand up and down Buddy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baby . ESTEBAN Well , my sister is very young , you see . She is not yet used to your customs , here in your wonderful land . Our home , it was in Nicaragua and it was all much difference there . We were owners of land there and we had our peculiar ways . It is easy for her to forget them . Not for me . ( He drinks . He clears his throat . ) BUDDY Big wheels in Nicaragua . I get it . What kind of land was it ? ESTEBAN Well , a great deal of land . Not exactly farm , you see . But a great deal of land . FRAZIER You were ranchers , maybe ? ESTEBAN Ah yes ! Just so , ranchers . We were ranchers and in the evenings we would sit on the veranda and all our friends would come and drink with us . We would entertain them and there would be singing and fine dancing , upon occasion . But most often we would only sit and drink from silver glasses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , and the songs of the night  --  ( Long pause . ) Well , it was very beautiful , and we did that every night . ( Teresa presses herself against Buddy , clutching his leg. ) p. 25 BUDDY Ranchers , sure . ESTEBAN But things went badly very suddenly . Many misfortunes and family troubles and losses . After a short time there were only three of us left . Three , where once had been a family of eight and of course many cousins . BUDDY All riding up on black stallions in the moonlight . ESTEBAN Now only myself and my sister . And , I beg your pardon , my aunt . Let me present to you , Senora Gonsalvez . BUDDY Hi . FRAZIER ( Smiling . ) I am very pleased to make your acquaintance . FELICIA ( Smiling . ) And I  --  yours . ESTEBAN Life has been not easy for my aunt , gentlemen . She was once a very fine and beautiful young women , but she had a misfortune to marry a man who was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't life a bitch . FRAZIER I 'm sorry to hear it . ESTEBAN Yes , a hard life for her . When I sent for my sister , I of course insist that she come too , and send passage for both . I have hope that she would find a new life here , as I have , but as yet , no , she will not forget her man . We are stubborn people , even in gracious America . ( Teresa now is frantic , trying to get Buddy to get her away from Esteban. ) p. 26 TERESA Vermanos ! Vermanos ! BUDDY Okay , Teresa , take it easy . Well , Mr. Esteban , sir . You wring my heart . But since we are in gracious America , gracious San Francisco , to be exact  --  ( Esteban interrupts , like a little boy in spite of himself . ) ESTEBAN Si ! Si ! My name , my name ! BUDDY What ? ESTEBAN Francisco , Esteban . San Francisco . ( Pause . ) Francisco  --  BUDDY I get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco Francisco , is that here things are a little different than in the old country , if Nicaragua is an old country and I do n't even know where the fuck it is , never mind its age . Follow me ? ESTEBAN Different , you say ? BUDDY Yessir . What you 're doing  --  I think  --  is done one way in the old country but a little different in the new , in September 1954 . FRAZIER Buddy what 're you talking about ? BUDDY You 'll see , dummy . ( To Esteban . ) I mean , Teresa here , she 's old enough to take care of herself . Do it her own way . ESTEBAN I do not comprehend . p. 27 BUDDY What do you do for a living , Mr. Esteban ? ESTEBAN ( Slowly . ) I take what jobs are at hand , sir . I have no choice . FRAZIER Jesus , Buddy . BUDDY If you say so . But how long do you think it 'll take for Teresa ? She 'll bust out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Nothing you can do about it . ESTEBAN I know that , sir . ( On her barstool , the woman coughs violently , spills her drink . Her eyes are glassy , her hair loose . She pulls herself up , waves a shaky hello to Esteban . ) WOMAN ( Weakly . ) Lo , Francisco . ( Esteban nods . She turns sadly to her drink and mutters to herself . ) BUDDY Maybe marry a millionaire . Maybe end up like your pal there . That 's the old U.S. ESTEBAN I see . BUDDY What do you do , keep her in the house all day ? I think I know what you got in mind at night , but what does she do all day , sit home ? ESTEBAN ( Fiercely . ) No ! No ! The contrary ! I start her to school soon ! To learn English ! To take opportunity ! p. 28 BUDDY Soon . ESTEBAN Yes ! Learn to speak well and write well and take work in a fine concern with dignity . And meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESTEBAN Of her own station in life , sir . I will see that it happens that way . ( Teresa runs her hand up and down Buddy 's leg . ) FRAZIER ( Gently . ) I do think Teresa has other ideas . ESTEBAN Of course ! And were I not her brother , el hermano , I would have other ideas too . But sir , I am the unfortunate head of my family . Not the same as once it was but , gentlemen , it will be like that again . At the moment , it is I must take care for her , because she understands this no more than you . She wants to perform what she sees done around her . Let matters of no substance determine her future . It is true we are in difficult position here . It is true I have only money to pay for drinks , and that is all . It is true , I confess to you , we take the help we can get , and ask you to treat us  --  well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not betray my sister ! She is ignorant of herself , and what she truly is ! We must live ! But  --  we must  --  we must  --  also  --  p. 29 FRAZIER Please , Mr. Esteban . We understand . It must be hard , coming here  --  ESTEBAN ( Shaking . ) It is ! That is her problem . BUDDY And you think we got no problem ? You ai n't going to no gooney-bird islands ! You 're going to sit right here tomorrow night with your sister , and somebody else , and we go off to keep it safe for you ! Why am I responsible for you ? You ai n't responsible for dick . I keep the peace , for you ? ( Under his breath . ) Buncha spics ? FRAZIER Buddy . TERESA Budi ! Budi ! Vermanos ! ( She blows in his ear , rubs his leg . ) BUDDY I understand her problem , all right . It 's you , hermano . FRAZIER Buddy , lay off . BUDDY Jesus , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , college boy ? ( Buddy drums his fingers on the table , very angry . Esteban sits up , stiffly , silent . Pause . Buddy jumps up . ) Well , hell . Let 's dance . Come on , honey . ( Teresa jumps up . ) ESTEBAN No ! BUDDY What ? p. 30 ESTEBAN I do not permit it ! BUDDY You do n't what ? ( Buddy is about to explode when the woman slides off her barstool and wobbles over to Esteban . ) WOMAN Hey , Francisco . I do n't feel so hot tonight . Do something for me , ca n't you ? I 'm still good , you know that . Be a sport , Francisco , please . Please , Francisco , please . ( She leans against him , trying to look seductive . Buddy goes to the table , smiling a wicked smile . ) BUDDY Does not permit it . Head of the family . ( He laughs . ) Well , listen , Mr. Hermano . Who permits this and does n't permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who 's a whole lot younger than he makes out , with his big Spanish dance . Eighteen , maybe ? Seventeen ? In gracious America , it just do n't work , this Big Brother shit . I mean , we just do n't feature it here . ( Frazier starts up , but Buddy grabs him by the shoulder and shoves him back in his seat . ) In America , hermano , your sister do n't do it for you . You let her go . She gets to find her own guy , and do it for him ! FRAZIER Buddy , what the hell are you talking about ? BUDDY This is the first time you 're trying it , kid , is that it ? I bet you have n't even told them what you 're up to . What did you think was going to happen , hermano ? The understanding soldier would grasp your hand ? Salute your gallant past ? And like a grand gentlemen , pass you the money under the table ? That what you had in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman and I ai n't no bullshit soldier . I 'm an honest man , and I like things on the table . ( He holds up a twenty-dollar bill . ) But here , good show and all that . I 'll leave you twenty bucks for the fun of it . Okay , pal ? ( He drops the bill on the table . ) Okay , pimp ? ( Esteban jumps up . The woman reels back against the wall . Chairs fall over . Everybody is up . Esteban stands shaking before them . ) You been pimping for your sister all night . You spic bastard . ( Esteban turns , pulling a knife . There is a click , and the blade gleams before them. ) p. 31 FELICIA No ! Francisco ! BARTENDER Hey ! Hey , now ! Francisco ! BUDDY All right , pimp ! ( Buddy pulls a bigger knife , huge , and it opens with an even more deadly click . ) Come on . I 'll fuck you , and then I 'll fuck your sister . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hat and gets out . The bartender pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar but stands back and waits . ) So ? Come on ? ( Pause . Slowly , Esteban lowers his knife . He sees plainly it would be unequal combat . He is flushed with humiliation . ) That 's right . Close your knife . ( Esteban does . ) Now , come here . ( Slowly , Esteban does . Buddy holds the point of his knife out at him . ) Now close mine . You started this . Put your hand against it and push . ( Esteban swallows , puts his hand against the point of Buddy 's knife , and pushes . As he gets the blade bent and almost in its socket , Buddy twists the knife a little , cutting Esteban 's palm , just slightly . ) Something to remember me by . ( He puts his knife back into his pocket . ) You ready , Frazier ? FRAZIER Yeah . I 'm ready . ( Frazier takes the twenty-dollar bill and tucks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender , and points at the bottle of brandy . ) Give me that . ( The bartender carefully tosses it to him . Frazier speaks to Esteban . ) May I see your hand , please ? p. 32 BUDDY What the hell you doing ? FRAZIER ( To Esteban . ) Sir , this is the best American brandy made . ( He pours it onto Esteban 's palm , all of it , waiting for all the brandy in the bottle to wash the wound , shaking it to make sure there is none left . Then he tosses the empty bottle to the bartender . He takes a white handkerchief from his pocket , puts it on Esteban 's cut , and holds him by the hand . ) You 're doing good . If it was me , in your country , I do n't think I could do any better . I hope things work out for you and your family . ( He ties the handkerchief around Esteban 's hand . ) Keep that . Forgive the insult . ESTEBAN Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deference for Teresa and Felicia to go with Esteban . ) TERESA ( To Buddy . ) No ! Give heem money ! More money ! I love you ! ( Buddy shrugs and steps back . With scorn . ) Sheet . ( She stalks out of the bar . Esteban waits for Felicia , who stops by Frazier , looks at him a second , touches his face . ) FELICIA A man . ( She leaves. ) p. 33 BUDDY Well , look , hermano . No hard feelings , what the hell . ( Esteban stares at him , leaves . ) So fuck you . ( Buddy and Frazier look at each other . ) You think that was n't a pimp ? ( Pause . ) You damn fool . FRAZIER You son of a bitch . ( A moment when neither moves . Then Frazier goes to the bar . Buddy goes back to the table . The bartender pours Frazier a drink . Buddy drinks the Hennessy , thinking . The bartender sets an overturned stool on its legs , takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy on the floor as the lights fade. )
