The gloves come off as Campaign ' 83 starts fast and ugly <P> As the rolling , majestic cadences of Rule Britannia sounded in London 's packed Conservative Party headquarters , a confident Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , 57 , strode to the podium to fire the first official salvo in Britain 's surprise 1983 election campaign . Flanked by Cabinet ministers , beneath a bright blue banner proclaiming the new Tory slogan BRITAIN STRONG AND FREE , Thatcher lost no time - and squandered no politesse-in proclaiming her determination to " ensure that Britain remains a steadfast ally in an uncertain world . " She unveiled a manifesto that would further toughen Tory policies on trade unionism , denationalization of state-run industries and big-city metropolitan councils . In so doing , Thatcher drew the battle lines with the opposition Labor Party in the bleakest terms . " The choice before the nation is stark , " she intoned , " either to continue our present progress toward recovery or to follow policies more extreme and more damaging than those ever put forward by any previous opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opposition candidates took to the hustings to mount fiery attacks of their own . Before a half-filled house at Glasgow 's cavernous Apollo Theater , Labor Party Leader Michael Foot , 69 , lashed out at the Prime Minister 's economic policies . " Thatcherism is the most appalling economic mess in generations ! " he shouted . " The industrial destruction she has inflicted upon this country is even worse than Hitler 's bombings . " Campaigning in the economically depressed West Midlands , Deputy Labor Party Leader Denis Healey discovered a mechanical crab at a street market and held it up before TV cameras . " It moves sideways and evades your every instruction , " he joked . " I 'm going to call it Sir Geoffrey Howe . " That swipe at Thatcher 's Chancellor of the Exchequer made the evening news programs . Said Healey : " Margaret Thatcher has turned the Tory Party into her personal dictatorship . " <P> Even Social Democratic Party Leader Roy Jenkins , who would become Prime Minister in the unlikely event of a victory by the centrist S.D.P./Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenkins acidly compared her new Tory manifesto to Field Marshal Douglas Haig 's message after the disastrous Battle of the Somme in 1916 : " Ground gained negligible , casualties intolerable , but press on .
