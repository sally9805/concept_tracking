 | The romantic star of TV 's Miami Vice has become a man of mystery ? and it 's not because he wo n't talk about his past . Like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn , Don Johnson was born in Missouri . And like the fictional Huck , Don has a mischievous and restless streak . Or so he would like you to believe . The sandy blond , casually 4unshaven star of NBC 's Miami Vice is the hottest television personality of the day . But his " overnight " success was preceded , he says , by some 15 years of forgettable films and TV appearances , a decade of drug and alcohol abuse , and an unconventional life-style . But Don thinks of those troubled years as a learning experience : " I learned early that you either get smart quick to stay free or they put you in an institution , " he says . " I credit those years of my life with developing two strengths : good observation and good retention of what I learn . " Today , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life pre Miami Vice , it seems hard to separate fiction from fact ? for much of what he tells interviewers is not substantiated by some of those who say they knew him when ... . One fact is indisputable : Don was born December 15 , 35 years ago , in his grandmother 's house near Galena , Mo . At his  | birth , his mother was only 16. his father some three years older . Don was the first of four children the couple would eventually have . Both parents ' families had been in the region -- -the Ozark Mountain section of Missouri -- for generations , and were hardworking . respected , religious folk . Don 's maternal grandfather Wilson was a Pentacostal Holiness preacher ; his grandfather Johnson was , according to Don 's Uncle .1 . C. Johnson , " a layman , but he preached to us . " Don 's father worked his father 's Missouri farm , but when Don was five , the family moved to Wichita , Kan .. where Mr. Johnson went to work for Boeing Aircraft . At first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manor , built as temporary housing for aircraft workers who swarmed into the city . But later the Johnsons bought a house in a middle-class neighborhood . Don 's childhood seems to have been pretty routine until he was II . Then his parents separated and divorced , an event that apparently was devastating to the youngster . After the split , Don stayed with his mother for about a year and it was during that time that , he tells writers , he first got into trouble ... . He says he fell in with the wrong crowd , hot-wired a car , and stole it . with the result that he was caught by the police and sent to a detention home for " a couple of weeks . " Yet Bobby Stout , a neighbor of the Johnsons and a Wichita police officer , now retired , finds the car-theft story hard to accept . Stout , who became a kind of father figure to Don after his parents ' divorce , says , " Don 's mother would come to me for advice . He 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as I know he was n't a had boy . I do n't know of any trouble he had with the police and , had he been in trouble , I 'm sure his mother would have called me . " Nick Mendoza , a high-school buddy of Don 's , also says the only thing he knows about a car theft in Don 's past is what he 's read lately in the papers . But , on the other hand , Don 's uncle refers offhandedly and mysteriously to " the scrape " his nephew got into in Wichita . So it is anybody 's guess as to what really happened . And since juvenile records are sealed , the mystery may never he resolved . Still , after the " scrape , " Don left his mother 's home and went to live with his father . When his father remarried and left Wichita to return to Galena , Mo. , the boy went with him ? and , says Don , it was at this point that his " problems " at home really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rural life ? milking cows , feeding chickens , working in the hay field , chopping sprouts . " His dad made him toe the line , " Uncle J.C . remembers . " My brother thought Don was big enough to take care of himself . Don and his father were real close . The only trouble was there was the new woman in the house . ' ' The " new woman " was of course Don 's stepmother . His relationship with her had its ups and downs , and at age 16 , he ran away from his father 's home and returned to Wichita . By now he was a senior in high school . According to Don , it was during his senior year at Wichita 's South High that he first became interested in dramatics . Because , as Don says , " I was failing a business course and in danger of not graduating , " he took the suggestion of a school counselor and transferred to a drama class . The result was an instant love affair with acting . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little different than Don relates . When he was living with his father in Galena , Mo. , he attended Crane High School . The 1966 yearbook from Crane High shows a picture of Don and a young woman in a scene from a play called Hullabaloo that the school put on . So it would seem that his interest in drama started not in Wichita but in Galena . And , according to the Crane High yearbook , Don was also  | in the Boys ' Glee Club , the Mixed Chorus , and the Boys ' Double Quartet . But regardless of where he got his start in drama , there seems no doubt but that Wichita 's South High drama coach , Karen Slater , was an important influence on Don . She welcomed him to her class , at first largely because he could sing and he was a tenor , and she needed a tenor to play the part of Tony in the musical West Side Story which the drama class was putting on . Don 's leading lady in West Side Story , LeAne Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not part of the ' in ' crowd . " On the other hand , everyone who knew Don in those days agrees that even then he was a ladies ' man , an almost irresistible magnet for girls . During his senior year at South High , he was senior attendant ( prom royalty ) at the junior-senior prom . And , as his steady at that time , Anna Davis . points out , Don would never have been " prom royalty " if he had been in any way a delinquent . " We did n't use the word ' preppy ' then , " the former Miss Davis says , " hut I 'd describe Don as nearly preppy. , , Don has called himself " a hell raiser , " yet Anna maintains . " he was n't that way at all . He never had trouble with the teachers . " She says that their high school romance was so serious they talked about getting married , " but we broke up just before graduation . " And as far as Don 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go in for pranks . But he always was a real flirt . " Other mysteries that surround Don include the exact place he was living during his senior year in high school ? and the number of women in his life . He says that during his senior year he " lived with a friend until I moved in with a 26-year-old cocktail waitress . " But both Bobby Stout and Karen Slater question that story , while Anna Davis finds it " funny . " " However , " she says , " after we broke up , he did date a girl who became a cocktail waitress . " " Don might have moved in and out of home when he had run-ins with his mother , " Bobby Stout says . " After she and Don 's father were divorced , she too married again , and I do n't think Don liked that . But I believe Don lived at home most of the time . His last few months here in Wichita , however , he did live with another family . " Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to become a serious actor , also doubts that Don was living entirely away from home during his senior year at South High . " His mother used to come to see me about Don , " Mrs. Slater says . " She was worried about him . She wanted him to have a good , basic education , because she wanted life to be easier for him than it had been for her . " Don was very , very ambitious . He was willing to do whatever he had to do to succeed . But he also had a good sense of humor and was a good sport . If he lost a contest , for instance , he 'd contact the judges , not to complain but to ask how he could have done better . " And so , encouraged by Mrs. Slater , his mother and Bobby Stout , Don graduated from high school in 1967 and managed to win a drama scholarship to the University of Kansas at Lawrence . But college life was not for Don . He was at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , The Kitchen ? not much longer . An acquaintance from that time of his life claims that Don did n't care about classes that were n't related to drama . And his high school friend , Nick Mendoza , who went to visit him in Lawrence , says that all Don was keen about was going to California to act . Don tells interviewers that , while in Lawrence , he lived with an older woman , and both Mendoza and Anna Davis say this was probably true . But Nick Mendoza says he does n't think Don was deeply in love at the time . " Don dated quite a few women and was always real popular , " Nick Mendoza says . " I always thought he had star quality . " Don left the University of Kansas in 1968 for San Francisco when he was offered the opportunity to join the American Conservatory Theatre there . However , he was not with the theater for very long . Shortly after his arrival in San Francisco , he was hired for his first professional stage appearance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims . it was at about this time that he got married for the first time , to a dancer . He was 18 years old ; the marriage lasted for about two months before it was annulled . He has n't named his wife . In December 1968 , Sal Mineo hired Don for a part in a play called Fortune and Men 's Eyes . The show was to be ' put on in Los Angeles , and Don was also supposed to go with it to New York . Instead , he decided to stay on in Los Angeles and accept a starring role he had been offered in a movie , The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart . Don had great hopes for the film and was quite devastated when it turned out to be a flop . Despite this setback he decided to stay on in Los Angeles ? he liked the life-style there . He surely liked the party scene and the drugs and alcohol that went with it . And he says he abused drugs and alcohol through most of the ' 70s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contributed to his drinking problem ? his mother had had similar difficulties ? but he blames his drug use on Hollywood and on himself . " Drugs , " he said , " were a life-style in Los Angeles , one that everyone was affecting at the time . Everyone .... ' Don also thinks that his own inability to grow up inclined him toward drug use . Though stardom continued to elude him , his romantic conquests did not falter . Sometime during this Los Angeles period , he says he married again ? and again he has n't named the woman . He says this second marriage was even briefer than the first had been . Certainly this is a convincing picture of a young actor on the fast track . Yet Jamie Masada , Don 's roommate and stand-in for several years , describes quite a different Don Johnson . Masada , who today manages a comedy club in Los Angeles , The Laugh Factory , says , " Don was the kindest and most generous person I knew . He would give money to people he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver it so the person would never know who the money came from . Once . when we were having lunch on location . Don had filled his plate with food when he noticed a raggedy-looking woman just staring at what was going on . Don walked over and handed her his plate . " He 'd sometimes bring flowers to some of the women on the set ? not because he was romantically interested in them but just as a nice gesture . Women would actually cry at the end of a picture because they would n't be working with Don Johnson anymore . " And , " Masada concludes , compounding the enigma of Don Johnson .  | " While Don may have done some drugs , I never knew he had a drug or drinking problem . " Some of the movies Don made during these years were The Harrad Experiment and Return to Macon County , plus TV movies and miniseries , such as The Rebels , From Here to Eternity , Elvis and The Showgirl . When I spoke to him at this point in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis would typecast him for the rest of his life ! It was in 1973 , when Don was making The Harrad Experiment , that he met Melanie Griffith , the daughter of the movie 's star , Tippi Hedren . Don was in his early twenties at the time , Melanie a mere 14 , but a romance quickly flared up between them . They lived together for three years and , in 1976 , got married . The marriage , however , was not as successful as the romance had been and the couple soon separated . Though , according to Don , his life seemed to consist of parties , drugs , and romance , it was n't all that way . His mother 's death from cancer in 1975 was , he says , aterrible blow . In fact , his childhood family friend , Bobby Stout , believes that Don 's greatest disappointment is that his mother died before he became a star , Early in 1982 , things began coming together at last for Don . It was then that he met the woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Arbanville . With her , he now has a son , Jesse , who was born on December 7 1982 . And , in 1983 , with Patti 's help and encouragement , Don successfully embarked on a treatment program for drug and alcohol abuse . He kicked his bad habits cold turkey and now , he says , when the press harps on his past transgressions , he says , It kind of hurts my feelings , ... " Yet Don himself has been so outspoken about his past mistakes that references to them are unavoidable . Even when he asked network executives to stop sending celebratory champagne each time Miami Vice made the top 10 TV ratings , his request found its way into a story . When Don first called a halt to his drug and alcohol life-style , his career was still at such a low ebb that his agent dropped him as a client and even recommended to Don that he get out of show business entirely . And when his publicity person tried to interest the press in stories about Don , just before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response she got was " Don who ? " " Rut , " she says today , " 1 had a feeling that Don would eventually make it . and I kept telling him that . " However , when Don 's name was proposed for Miami Vice , network executives shuddered . They did n't have to ask " Don who ? " They knew who he was , and they were reluctant to take a chance on him . Don was n't surprised by this reaction , since in Hollywood not only does nothing succeed like success , but nothing fails like failure -- and Don , at this point , was not a success . Nevertheless , after the network tested practically every other possible actor for the role of Detective Crockett. they at last let Don read for the show with Philip Michael Thomas , who had already been hired . The combination was electric . " Philip had already read with four or five other guys , " Don says . " They put Philip and me in a room , and we just went for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' We sparked a natural energy. , , It was so extraordinary , the doubters were completely sold . Don got the role . which has made him rich , powerful , and very , very happy . Already expanding his horizons , he 's just directed an episode of Miami Vice , an exercise in power that may remind him of a joke he made before the first episode ever went on the air . Someone was asking him about Elvis , the 12-foot alligator which was then a part of the Miami Vice cast . " Elvis has handlers , " Don joked . " He travels with his entourage . That alligator is so powerful he 's negotiating to direct . " Don 's personal life is also on a satisfyingly even keel . He and Patti are still together . Though she lives with Jesse in California while Don lives in Miami , they are very close and their relationship , Don says , is working . And when Don was invited to the White House to visit President Reagan , Patti and Jesse went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , Don realizes that TVseries stardom is n't like diamonds : It 's not forever . " What strikes me about fame , " he says , " is that once you achieve it , there 's nothing left but to become infamous . " Still , he does n't seem to have much to worry about in that direction ? movie deals are coming his way and he has a record album being released for which he wrote most of the material . The boy from Missouri who used to cut sprouts has become a sex symbol ? and even a style-setter with his Italianlook wardrobe for the show . And he has cut a nice niche for himself in the hearts and minds of millions of fans ? not the least of whom are the same TV executives who once cringed at the very mention of his name .
