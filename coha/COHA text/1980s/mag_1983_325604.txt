Reprimands asked for two <P> The House Ethics Committee declared seven months ago that , although it was continuing to investigate , it had been unable to document accusations , made by two Capitol Hill pages , of sexual liaisons between Congressmen and their teen-age gofers during 1981 and 1982 . Washington greeted the finding with understandable relief-prematurely . Last week the Ethics Committee recommended that the full House " reprimand " two Representatives , Democrat Gerry Studds of Massachusetts and Republican Daniel Crane of Illinois , for having had sex with pages in 1973 and 1980 , respectively . <P> A reprimand-an official statement of disapproval-is the House 's mildest form of punishment for serious misconduct by members . The committee found that in both cases the sex had not been coerced . Still , it made the obvious point that " any sexual relationship between a member of the House of Representatives and a congressional page , or any sexual advance by a member to a page , represents a serious breach of duty . " Given the " special responsibility " of Congress toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special counsel to the committee , which is also probing drug use on the Hill , " only one standard of conduct can be appropriate . " <P> Both Congressmen admitted their misconduct . Studds ' dalliance occurred a decade ago with a 17-year-old boy , just after the Congressman 's election to the House . Last week , in an extraordinary speech on the House floor , he confirmed unapologetically what had long been rumored-that he was a homosexual-and granted that he had made " a very serious error in judgment " in sleeping with the page . <P> Studds , who is unmarried , said only that he was wrong to have had sex with a congressional subordinate , no matter what the page 's age or sex . " It is not a simple task for any of us to meet adequately the obligations of either public or private life , " Studds told his rapt colleagues . " But these challenges are made substantially more complex when one is , as am I , both an elected public official and gay . " <P> According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Georgetown apartment , and then later that summer took the boy on a two-week trip to Portugal . The ex-page testified that he bore no ill will toward Studds . <P> Congressman Daniel Crane , 47 , in a brief written apology , said , " I 'm sorry that I made a mistake . I 'm human , and in no way did I violate my oath of office . I only hope my wife and children will forgive me . " Crane , a dentist from Danville , came to Capitol Hill in 1979 . A year later , he and a female House page , then 17 , had sex four or five times at his suburban apartment . The page , testifying that she " found the Congressman as an older man very attractive , " admitted that she was " perhaps more responsible for the sexual relationship than he was . " <P> The probe found that James Howarth , who had supervised the House pages until last December , when he was given other duties , had had sex in 1980 with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howarth of buying cocaine in the House 's Democratic cloakroom , possibly from another House staffer . Howarth contests the charges . The probe into drug use is continuing .
