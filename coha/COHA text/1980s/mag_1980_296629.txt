A gentleman of Japan builds a school with a sublime object <P> Amid the studiously reserved company men who usually head Japan 's big corporations , Konosuke Matsushita , 85 , has long been an outspoken exception . The son of a poor rice dealer , he founded the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. as a three-person shop in 1918 , built it into one of the world 's largest producers of consumer electronic goods , and used his prestige to expound opinions on everything from nuclear power ( he favors it ) to the businessman 's role as the servant of society . In 1973 he retired , but only to become more active in other fields . His earnest , upbeat magazine PHP-Peace and Happiness through Prosperity-is Japan 's largest-selling monthly . He is the most sought-after lecturer in Japan . This month the octogenarian opened the Matsushita School of Government and Management in the seaside city of Chigasaki , 30 miles southwest of Tokyo . Its unabashed purpose : to train the leaders Japan needs for the 21st century . <P> Matsushita has preached for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been afraid that his country was not developing enough leaders to succeed the U.S. as the " center of human prosperity . " The new school , into which Matsushita has already put $28 million of his " spending money , " attacks the problem head on . Students are given free tuition , room and full board and a $600-a-month stipend . " I was determined to open this school even if there was but one applicant , " said Matsushita in the inaugural address . There were , in fact , 907 applicants , but just 24 passed the grueling written and oral entrance exam . Says new Principal Yasushi Hisakado : " We looked for those exuding ambition . " <P> The scholars , all college graduates , will study under a total of 44 visiting lecturers , including Economist John Kenneth Galbraith ( the only foreigner scheduled ) , Science Fiction Writer Sakyo Komatsu , Tea Ceremonies Master Soshitsu Sen and Matsushita 's electronics competitor Masaru Ibuka , founder of the Sony Corp . After three years of this lecture blizzard , students will be dispatched " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and factories and will be sent for six months to a foreign country of their own choosing . <P> The curriculum emphasizes foreign languages and physical conditioning , including swordsmanship . But " nearly everything that could be taught at a regular college is out , " says Hisakado . The dominant lecture themes attempt to define the essential qualities of human beings and the disciplines that help a society endure . Most students in the entering class share one sentiment . Kenji Yoshida , 24 , a graduate of Osaka University Law School , observes that many question " the existing Japanese value system , and entered this school in search of an answer . " <P> Eventually , most want to go into politics , but Masato Degawa , 24 , who studied at Oxford 's Worcester College , wants to work in international cultural exchange . Matsushita makes no demands of his graduates . " They can do what they please , in whatever field they might choose , " he told TIME Correspondent S. Chang . " All I want to see is good leadership material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
