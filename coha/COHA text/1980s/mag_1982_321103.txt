MARCO POLO , IF YOU CAN by William F. Buckley Jr . Doubleday ; 233 pages ; $13.95 <P> Veterans of Cold War I who are rushing to re-enlist for Cold War II should get a lift from this jaunty medley of 1950s history and spy fiction . Through diplomatic freeze and thaw , William F. Buckley Jr. , editor of the National Review , has always kept his ideological thermostat set at a conservative 32 F. In his fourth novel-entertainment , he again slips into the adventurous alter id , Blackford Oakes , the dashing Yalie spook who first appeared in Saving the Queen . <P> Oakes , like the author , is a remarkably versatile fellow . In Marco Polo , If You Can , he quotes Yeats , works for the CIA and pilots a U2 . But he is not a routine spy in the sky . Because a mole in the National Security Council has been passing policy secrets to the Soviets , Oakes is asked to fake a forced landing in the U.S.S.R. and allow a packet of forged documents to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neutralize a Soviet agent and drive a wedge into Chinese-Soviet relations . Can Blackie pull off this caper and get home in time for such bourgeois sentimentality as marrying his sweetheart and celebrating Christmas ? Not to worry ; the East and West love to swap important captured agents at any time of the year . <P> Buckley embroiders this story with subplots and uneven characterizations of such personages as Allen Dulles , J. Edgar Hoover , Dean Acheson , Nikita Khrushchev and Charles de Gaulle . The results are mixed . The author 's portrait of Hoover , for example , seems a weak parody of old newsweeklies : " Jut-jawed , beefy , all business , " etc . <P> But Buckley 's Eisenhower is a refreshing bit of revisionism . From behind the famous grin and fractured press-conference syntax , the Great Golfer emerges as crisp , shrewd and decisive : " Herter , go back and study the minutes of all National Security Council meetings going back three months at least . Then assume everything we said is known to the Kremlin . Report back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) our policy ; b ) our negotiations ; c ) our public statements . . . Twining ? Do the same thing . . . Get back to me by the fifth of October , or by the time their missiles land on us , whichever comes first . . . Dulles ? Find the mole . " <P> The assignment proves difficult , dangerous and , at times , confusing to the reader . Buckley 's narrative line has some loops and kinks . From a scene in which Oakes awaits sentence for espionage in Moscow , the book flashes back to Fascist Italy and fashionable Washington with a romantic side trip to Bermuda . Buckley the novelist , unlike Buckley the columnist and lecturer , is not out to score debating points . But there are some targets of opportunity that are too juicy to overlook . An American Communist lawyer , representing a captured Soviet spy , aggressively defends his client 's civil rights in a manner that bespeaks contempt for America and its democratic institutions . Fiction , as the busy Buckley illustrates once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - By R.Z. Sheppard
