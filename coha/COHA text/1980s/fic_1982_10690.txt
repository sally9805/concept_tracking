rang up Number One on Bethany 's list . " Uh , the person in Davis , I 'm the one who received your letter  --  " Obedience to Bethany was not the optimal state of mind , he noted ; start again . " This is Watkins . It 's a peculiar moment for both of us , I imag-ine . " " Definitely weird , " she said . " But we 're both normal embarrassed people . If this is too squirmy for you  --  " ' No , " she said . She sounded cautious by telephone , unlike her high-spirited but sensible letter . " Yes , " she said . " All right , a visit would be convenient this weekend . Please come to my house and I 'll make dinner . I 'd rather not go out  --  I 'll explain . " " May I bring something ?

And dread . He was comforted by the distance between Davis and Beverly Hills ; perhaps she was also reassured . If it 's a traveling thing , it 's not really real , it 's just a foot in the water . Anybody was less likely to complicate things too soon , less likely to report back to anybody else . He was unused to these doings and so was she . She was scared , like him , and he tried to pass the time on the flight to L.A. International by imagining her distress . Since he did n't know her very well , he could only imagine his own . But he would try to go easy on her , hoping for magic  --  maybe she would go easy on him , too . Think Adventure , he thought.  |p42In  his mind , as a gesture of adventurous independence , he resolved not necessarily to take them in the future in the order Bethany had given them to him . Adela Jenkins lived in a high rise on Wilshire Boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent a car , and he did as told . He sped to her high rise on Wilshire with wine , with flowers , with a hotel reservation in his pocket , just in case , but thinking adventure . In the cab he also worried about details : Where do I put my bag ? Nonchalantly at her door ? As if I 'm just staying a moment , surely not for the night ? Nonchalantly ? These adventurous thoughts filled the idle half hour , forty minutes , of taxi . He was calm , but his heart and stomach were enfevered . They throbbed , but of course he was like ice , a pillar of strength and resolution and  --  dare he praise himself ?  --  a certaindaring . No , probably not ; ' no heroes appropriate to this war . No turning back , however , either . The building had a doorman and a full closed-circuit welcomingmachinery . Television , pipes , electricity .

He throbbed at her door and she seemed to hear . She opened . Either those were her eyes or she wore glowing contact lenses . They stood and introduced each other to each other and he put down his bag and was quite sure , no choice about it now , he would not be using his hotel reservation . " Why I wanted to cook , " she was saying , " has to do with my daughter 's phases . She is going through a passage right now . In fact "  --  slant at left corner of mouth traced lineaments of humor  --  " she lives in one . You 'll notice . " He was made comfortable . Dubonnet . Chipped ice . A woman lawyer who worked for MGM in-house , **28;9305;TOOLONG . She was a colleague in the law . She had an agreeable large mouth with a swift way of shifting into a stubborn firm setness , gleamy intelligent eyes with the hysteria under management , highly professional grooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p43fluffed  and reddish in certain lights . If there are grades of henna , this was the best . His fellow attorney 's house was green with plants , ferns , cyclamens , airy with puffed pillows , stamped for contemporaneity with prints by Chagall , Picasso and a large Lichtenstein cartoon with dots like cannonballs . There were no photographs of men . He did n't expect any . He was no more uncomfortable than God meant him to be . " Sherry ! " she called . " Sherry , you march right out of there now , please  --  then you can go back . " Sherry emerged , blinking , as from a cave . Sherry was her daughter . She was eleven or twelve , cute , blond , button-nosed and wearing a child-tailored World War II combat camouflage uniform with ammo clip and belt from which hung child-sized grenades . " Sherry , this is Mr. Watkins . " The child saluted smartly . " Hi , " said Watkins . " May I return to duty , Ma ? " the child asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , until Ma signed him to retreat . But he saw the tent pitched in her bedroom , surrounded by armament . " Sherry likes to play war , " Ma said . " She 's an island fighter . It 's only a game , of course . " " Naturally . " " This is a crucial juncture in her negotiation with the Viet Cong , " she said . " That 's why I wanted to remain on the scene , monitoring developments , and have dinner in . You do n't mind ? " " I so seldom get a home-cooked meal , " said Watkins . " Sherry 's a delight , but my son has problems . I 'll say no more , except he 's older  --  you would n't think I 'd have a son his age , would you ? " Her eyes , Los Angeles beaver eyes , fluttered and lowered themselves with the kind of flirtatious winsomeness a mature woman achieves when she pays herself a compliment . " Pharmacuticles , " she said . " Pardon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " she said ,  |p44looking  at her nails . " That 's why I do pro bono work in drug abuse , like that famous master of ceremonies whose daughter did it . I 'm like him . I did n't push my son around ; he got to be a disbarred lawyer all by himself . Naturally , I shared my input into his decision-making process . As far as his addiction is concerned , I showed him the way . I 'd say he 's halfway cured already . He 's in a halfway house . I 'll say no more . Later we can share the problem of maybe getting his license to practice back . Or he can always do legal research for some understanding attorney . Some of our finest saints started life as sinners , I ought to know . And he knows that , too  --  a fine boy , like me . " Watkins listened attentively . Sometimes life took him elsewhere . This was one of those occasions . " I happened to find myself with him , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal prodigy . Then for me came marriage ; for him , pharmacuticles . It 's a halfway house all the way . A mother 's anguish  --  a single parent 's pride  --  a Parents without Partners life  --  an affirming crisis which separates the men from the boys . I 'll say no more . You 're not a vegetarian , are you  --  you eat carnivore ? " Watkins nodded . There was a jungle beast in him which demandedconvenient high-density protein . He wished to mention , in addition , how he too was nervous in this situation with Adela Jenkins and had a whole life 's story to impart . But perhaps the island fighter 's mother understood . He would say no more . She offered a glimpse of the carefree inventiveness and hope of adventure which breathed through her winner of a letter . It had won Bethany . It was first for her . Adela 's eyes glistened ; her lipgloss glistened . " I 'll tell you one thing , " she confided , " we 're not having field rations out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You guessed it . If there 's a smell of scorch , that 's Sherry 's grub on her alcohol burner . " " I brought a white , " Watkins said apologetically , " but it 's chilled . " He zipped open his bag . The bottle lay snugly against shaving things , two shirts , socks . Swiftly , shyly , he zipped shut.  |p45It  seemed overly suggestive to let the zipper sound , to show his socks . " An unpretentious fine French chilled white , " he said . " It 's not your fault . How could you have known ? I might have been a fish person . We 'll save it for some enchanted seafood evening . " She turned the bottle over in her hands , reading their fortune in the green glass . " Chenin Blanc nineteen seventyfour . " She cradled it in her arms . " Ca n't say I know that year . " He shrugged modestly . " Or breakfast , " she remarked , " when we 're having cold salmon . Who says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foot to German Riesling for the seafood omelets ? " They were both shy . They were both embarrassed . Some speak copiously to cover the silence ; Adela may have been one of those , despite her rule about saying no more . " I used to have a Close Personal Friend , " she said , " you know what that means in Ellay ? But then I responded to your ad because it was such a very interesting appeal , Watkins . I mean I had this Close Personal Friend I was just totally sick of . He had no finesse , he lacked panache . On Sunday mornings when I said sailing , he said lie in bed and read the stupid trades . I said Tijuana , let 's just be crazy kids , he said got to get up early take a breakfast meet . I said I have n't seen Venice , Italy , yet , he said it 's sinking , let 's wait till they float it again . Watkins , I 'm so loyal , but I 'm not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally out of it . How could I have been so innocent not to notice till I read your vita and it hit me over the head what 's really out there , an attorney like myself but a live one ? " He did n't have the answer on the tip of his tongue . Internal static and chaos often put Watkins , who had been obliged by fate to study living alone , in a brooding and paralyzed jungle playdeadmood . In which he sometimes talked a lot  --  jabbered . One of these tangled moods was coming on him now . He vowed to fight his inclination . Unfair to the hostess , it would only challenge her . Surely she did n't need any more challenges , what with Sherry , plus her son , plus a close personal friend with a missing panache , plus the plain turmoil of existence in a world in which an attractive woman , dressed for success both mentallyp46and personal decor-wise , could only find true love through the classified section . Since facts are facts , Adela Jenkins had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank God for advertising , and for all the finesse and panache just begging for a decent meal and a little attention out there . " Are you always so silent ? " Adela asked . " You 've given me a lot to think about . " " I like depth in a man . I was afraid you 'd be one of those always telling me about his broker , his alimony , his Tamaran at Marina del Mar he only has time to sail one weekend a month , they asked him to Washington for a workup and he turned down the appointment in the White House , undersecretary of trilateralthis or that  --  I prefer depth in a man . If the truth be told , it 's sweeter  --  depth plus a devil-may-care streak . " " That 's me , " Watkins said gloomily . Adela compressed her lipgloss together , shook her curls , pointed a finger with a winning cuticle job on it and just plain beamed out of her beaver eyes at him . They both knew what she was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was overwhelmedby all her knowledge , experience , control and general smooth ; he was only a small-town academic attorney with an overnight bag near the outer door ; this was not easy for anybody . Having faced the fact , they could go on . The kid with the combat equipment , slowing down any possibleattack from either quarter , served as chaperone with her intercondominium ballistic missiles . Sherry eased matters somewhat . She was a godsend , a Medal of Honor candidate . The battle for atolls dwarfed the hunger for sharing . Eventually Adela and Watkins must speak about why they had , to put the matter straight , advertised for company . Definitely a must topic , and so far Adela had only sketched out the perimeters . Watkins 's input was total zilch ; his output , zip . Such terrific high-tohigherachievers as they were , or as one of them stated herself to be , they owed each other a few explanations . They could strive to be whimsical , frank , honest , a touch triste . Depth wasp47not beyond their grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in their own words . Maybe he would tell her about Bethany . Despite her vow of silence , she might talk about her son and her close personal friend . It was essential . On the other hand , maybe they had both already said enough , given their mutual tact and innate sympathy , and they could just move right along to the future , which is what counts when a person only has a limited patience with past errors and wrongs . Disco nights and lunchaholic all-day meets do n't count anymore . True , herpes might count , and so might a non-funlovingattitude . The important thing was to seize the moment on the wing , because every option expires unless it 's renewed . That 's the nature of life , red in tooth and claw when a person idealistically reaches out his or her lonely arms toward the bottomline . Face it , we 're all beasts out here . Yes , we 're also capableof gentleness , kindness , devotion , the purest kind of altruism and nonoffice giving , full of dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being asked . We 're just kids at heart . So naturally we have to twist a little knife now and then in the dark , just to forestall misunderstanding . Watkins felt a little vertigo . Maybe the situation , or maybe Adela 's generosity in taking so much of the initiative , made him a bit dizzy . He was learning . This was Wilshire and he had a lot to learn . Adela was the hostess and he would follow her lead . Adela felt the same way . She would follow her own lead . " That 's neat , " she said , returning to the main business of the evening and concluding the previous matter of the non-Riesling chilled white wine suitable for a seafood breakfast omelet or cold poached salmon . She stored it away . Deftly she inserted the daisies into a narrow-necked faded blue vase of some sort of crackly antique make , carried north or west from an ethnic society to remind everyone of truer values . There were fine ethnic crackle lines in the glaze . She did n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase , but he guessed Baja.  |p48Watkins  inclined his head modestly . Self-control was returning with the little wine-and-flower ceremonies . " You 're welcome , " he murmured . " And now a light supper , Mr. Watkins ! " " Wat , " he said . " Watkins is my first name . Called Wat by my friends . " While scorch aromas of field rations wafted from the tentstuffedbedroom , they ate the following : chilled vichyssoise , which she did not pronounce without the final consonant  --  she also did not say " bo-teek " when she meant boutique ; a salad with a light herbal dressing  --  they both commented on the French habit of serving salad after the meat course ; a meat course , the aforementioned beef Bourguignon with baby carrots in a sweetishwine gravy , which she called " au jus " and he did not disagree ; fruit and cheese . " I do n't believe in heavy meals at night , " she said , while he thought : And she blushes . That 's nice . " My son , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to lay it all out . I mean you have such a gentle , understanding , really human face I want to tell you about my boy . You have a genuine face , so about my son  --  this is hard for me . " " Go on , " said Wat . Possessed of an entire physiognomy , with features , eyes , ears , nose , mouth , and skin joining everything in between , could he offer less ? " Please . I 'm all ears , nose and throat . No , sorry , I really mean it . " " You do ? " " I do . " " All right . You asked me , and a real person like you deserves to suffer no secrets . My son . This is hard for me , Watkins . My son , like his father , he has this tendency to ejaculatory impotencedespite erection . We 're very honest with each other , Wat . Normally , your average insensitive person , ejaculation is the forceful propulsion of seminal fluid along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle and simultaneous closure of the bladder neck . Stop me if I left something out , Watkins . " " I think you covered it . " " Well , my son is different . Having a real bitch for a fatherp49made him different . I 'll say no more . " Watkins appreciated that . He appreciated discretion in a new friend . " You like some extra au jus with your carnivore ? " " Delicious , " said Watkins , slapping his napkin . " Really tasty , with a nice tang . " She dipped out some red-eyed sauce . " Say no more , " she said . She served espresso in little cups . Alertness seemed to be in the cards before the night 's repose . But first , having said no more , they talked . Her marriage , his marriages . The tasks of in-house counsel in a major conglomeratesuch as MGM , movies plus real estate plus hotel investments ; the MGM Grand in Las Vegas , plus liaison with specializedfirms in several overseas areas . Her work , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . She went to look at Sherry . Sherry was sleeping in full field pack , sprawled precariously , little legs askew . With a trilling laugh Adela asked , " Why do we have to explain everything ? Let 's save something for later . " He nodded . She wafted a half turn around the room as his eyes followed her , and while she was remarking , " The cleaning woman will clean up in the morning , " she wafted herself into his arms , onto his lap  --  actually , kind of between his thighs  --  where she took a firm grip ( " Easy ! " he cried ) , and she asked , " Right hand or left ? " A cuteness , he supposed . Perhaps because he was so terrified and distant , he noticed no difficulties . What should have produced premature performance produced adequate performance . From a distance . From a distance he heard her voice asking amid the tumbled clothes , amid the beef Bourguignon remnants : " Am I beautiful ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so . " " Am I wonderful ? " This was an interrogatory . " Am I wonderful ? " she repeated . " To the best of my knowledge , " he stated.  |p50Tumbled  there on a nubby orange carpet , of some kind of material which would wipe away stains ( WipeAway Fabric of Sunburst Orange , he thought ) , she gazed up at him . Suddenly she was happily in love with someone , a person who was beautiful , good , wonderful  --  herself . This might be the only true love ! She sighed and touched him . " You 're nice , " she said . " I 'm glad you wrote to me . " " Me too , " he said . " Do you like to be touched there ? Like this ? " " Will it wake up Sherry ? " " I doubt it , darling . She 's a light sleeper , so I put a mild analgesic in her field rations  --  enough to tranquilize a veteran afflicted with night fears , my sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of that sooner , did you ? Men ! But she 's ten miles out in dodoland , dearest . " To prove her point , she temporarily removed her hand and turned the music up . It was Jean-Pierre Rampal playing Japanesefolk melodies on his romantic French flute , softer before and not too loud now . Returning , she touched him lightly with a wetted index finger . It was an oddly ingratiating gesture , like a pointer to a blackboard in an accident damage suit demonstration . She was presenting evidence for consideration of all present , including him . " Right here , " she said . She was persuasive in her analysis . It was right there . To her lips , to his right-there . To his right-there , to her lips . He remembered the leaves of faintest autumn falling , letting in the sky , on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley , where he had found a girl to do what they were now doing on the WipeAway Fabric of nubby Sunburst Orange . They were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a generation ago . She had tired finally of using her fingers , and before the first winter rains , her tongue had fallen to this work ; she discovered a greed in herself which astonished them both ; and thus he married his first wife , alas . Now she was the one he liked the least of his wives  --  her greed did not mean the true love he thought it meant at nineteen , it meant onlyp51greed plus a small amount of intelligent calculation  --  finally all those choked gasping cries had painful implications when property-settlementtime came along . . . " Are you thinking of your baby , " the in-house counsel from MGM Pictures and Real Estateasked , " or are you , perchance , woolgathering ? " " Woolgathering , " he admitted . At his age he sought to be honest ; had no choice ; sometimes did n't care to lie . " Well , pay attention . I want you to do this now . " With firm hands on his ears she directed him where to go . The campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious in their brisk sharp chills , disappeared . Well , it was n't a long happiness . Now he was committed to humid , oily , hot work , kept busy , urged to keep busier . After a while , the hands gripping his ears let go , trusting him , and with her climax came some nice friendly pats on the head . He rested where he was . " Nice , " she said , " that 's nice . I like how you just stay still there now . " He was trying to recall Bethany and succeeding all too well ; her clean fizzy smells , her eager chipper laughter , her caring . " I 'd like to get to know you , " she said , growling a little . She must have spent some time in MGM screening rooms . " Me too , " he said . " You 're good . You 're very good . You Northern Californians are surprisingly good , " she said . He was the peripheral canal , bringing irrigation to the parched southland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she whispered , the growling of passion subsiding into the curiosity of a thoughtful temperament , " and then I 'll say no more . Are you happy , too ? Did you ? ... " The roar of her engine must have drowned out his own little revving-up on the proving ground . " Just hold me , " he said , " that 's enough . " She clutched him to her creamy sallow skin . He felt yoga classes , nonfad diets , cosmetics from Rodeo Drive and not too much sun . She was also grateful , and that was nice of her . He was aware of Adrian  --  Adelle  --  no , Adela  --  as she held him , but through her eyes he seemed to see himself receding , receding ,  |p52into  the middle distance . Into the far distance . Gone . Now what . A long night ahead . It did n't make sense to pick up his bag , retreat , try to check in late at a hotel . It also did n't make sense not to , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Also a practical matter : to pee . To pee or not to pee was not a question ; it answered itself . He could n't quite recall , in a state of partial somnolence , where the bathroom was , although he presumed he must have used it already , perhaps beforedinner  --  oh yes , past the hanging plants , past the door leadingto the tent and Sherry 's field exercise , then hang a sharp right into the black tiles of comfort station . As a practical matter , while he thought about it , his crotch was sticky and he felt a small unalert wiggle against his thigh , as if the wiggler sought a place to hide . The wiggler was retreatingfast ; the sensation of itch persisted . A travel memory came to him . Tahiti . A giant land crab clutched a coconut and broke it with one straight convulsion of its claws , and the milk flowed . He was no armored clattering tropical crab . He was in the grip of things . Watkins climbed up . Adela 's lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vulnerable , there was a little childish vulnerable snore when he disturbed her on nubby fabric . She caught her breath , moaned and continued her sleep . He was heading barefoot down the long verdant trail , past bubbling aquarium , ferns , pots , greens suspended from wires , a Far East of plants , toward the black-tiled bathroom . What he felt must be more than the sadness after sex . At his age postcoital melancholy should be put into perspective . A grown man reckons with it , then cancels it out . Relief lay ahead when peeing , but not yet . He crept past darkened trees , flowers and souvenirs . No , this was the honest midnight grief of the bus stop and the no-buscomingblues . He stood before the commode . The itch stopped him a moment . A reflex of withdrawal . Relief came in a stream of warm and wet . Suddenly a blast of sound shot forth from nubby fabric central . " Do n't leave the seat up ! My husband always left the god/damn seat up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down ? Goddammit , what makes you think you 're better than I am , just because you stand up ? " He said nothing . He finished . He shook . He thought to return , where he would inquire into the welfare and dreams of his lady , reassure her of his consideration . At the moment he felt naked , and was ; and as he turned , he found himself in Vietnam , with Sherry facing him , the size of an enemy , her electronic rifle aiming to cut him in half , the combat child crying , " Ack-ackack ! Ack-ack-ack ! " Well , what did you expect ? This is the dramatic part of the state , he thought as he packed up to leave in the swift silence after battle . An eerie silence fell over the troops . The mother was back at the command post , watching in the dark . She had radar eyes and control of human waves of infantry ready to sacrifice themselves . Better not to speak . On the street outside , wondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to commandeer a civilian vehicle , Watkins realized that in his chagrin , haste , terror and doomed carelessness , he had left the toilet seat up . He trudged , carrying his overnight case , toward a distant marquee . It seemed to promise a lodging for the night.  |p55Carrying  his overnight bag at 2:0o A.M. on Wilshire in L.A. , Watkins had turned to see if there was life in the high rise where Sherry and her mother had made him feel at home . Lights dotted the steel-and-glass tube . Here and there folks lay awake , or left their lamps burning the way he sometimes , in Davis , left the radio on for company in his absence , so he would n't be alone when he returned . He found a bivouac in a building where they were selling executive condominiums . The guard , whose shirt was covered with little snippets of black curls , wanted to know what he had in mind , mon , and where he had stashed his wheels . No , at this moment before dawn he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made for a few hours . The negotiation was brief . The watchman had to interrupt his selfinflictedhaircut . He offered to show sample accommodations in several sizes , but Watkins chose a stripped-down one-and-a-half bedroom plus wet bar . This was only a temporary . The watchmanaccepted a twenty as compensation for the momentum he had lost in doing his sideburns . He threw in his own time-shared towel in case Watkins wanted to freshen up a little in the morning . If you snap the towel , the hair comes right out . Probably Bethany did n't want a complete report on his visit to Los Angeles and the Wilshire high-rise bunker . Even though Adela Jenkins stood Number One on the list , an attorney with a fulfilling job in middle-level management , a sharpshooting daughter , a son in a wonderful halfway house , Watkins 's profoundconviction was that Bethany was not in the slightest , not even faintly or incipiently jealous . So the only reason to tell herp56would be for the comradeship of it , and he did n't feel he could face her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly . He knew it would spread , it would take on acid and mucous , it was desire made rancid . He had never been jealous of her husband . The athletic young periodontist used to seize her on Saturday night and maybe one or two days during the week , but her joy was with Watkins . No more . Bile , food in bad repair , longing enmeshed in desire to hurt . He spent the week sighing and recovering . He proceeded despite himself , a man startled from sleep , hurried into life against his will , his head filled with mists , his soul caught between dreaming and waking . He seemed to have chosen this slap in the face of a comfortable middle age . Unlike Vic Lonkin , he was not doing the great things people had expected of him . He was agitated . He chose to let Bethany choose for him . The days passed . No herpes , no painful urination . He recovered his spirits , and recovered spirits inquired : Where the sense of adventure , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if anyone noticed how he shifted his obligations around in favor of white spaces on the appointment book which remained unaccounted for . His secretarymay have thought this the prudent slowing down of a man in the middle of his life , a sort of silent jogging . Or may not have thought about it at all . On to the next on his list . Of course he could write anonymous letters to Bethany 's husband , he could offer venomous proof , birthmarks , words she cried , her tanned arms flying up to claw at his back  --  what proof is that ? A letter to the **26;9335;TOOLONG would express his hatred of Bethany . But it would not express his love . He wanted her , not to punish her for abandoning him . If he could n't have her , he could hope on a certain February , with the winter flowers blooming , the hedges throwing their scents into the winter sunlight , she might remember him .

A bunch of town kids slid by on roller skates ; a sweet-faced Chinese couple from the university was walking their dog past his house , making sure it did its dropping near his house and not near theirs ; a jogger with Walkman music plugged into his ears was making his turn around the campus before going home to something . Surely they all had something to go home to . Watkins was alone with a weekend underplanned . He peeked into the box to see what Bethany had rejected on his behalf .

She had stopped ranking them after Number Eight , but she left the other replies neatly clipped together . Some showed thoughtful penmanship , being written with nibs , not ballpoints , their i 's neatly circled ; most , of course , were businesslike and typed , no matter how much compositional turbulence had gone into the mere words . Well , perhaps Bethany was n't perfect . Adela from Wilshire Boulevard could be considered an error . Maybe he would find a diamond here among the unnumbered and unranked , a genius at true love , a woman of intense spirit unlike Bethany 's carefree but cautious one . Surely she meant for him to make up his own mind . The inside of his head , where part of the mind is located , felt like an old clock radio , rusty , bunched connections and solderings , and noise , but it worked unnecessarily .

My doctor tells me that , were Ito aspire to " motherhood " and all which that ensues , I must make the decision soon . For reasons too complicatedto tell , I have been sellebate since the age of 18 , and before that I was a " virgin , " innocent of men and men ' s ways .

" Yet many " lovers " have been mine for the " asking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to see up until the age of about thirty , always , I frankly add , by a man who seldom was content with a bite to eat , a serious film and a sharing of an evening . They always wanted more than companionship . To date ,  |p64I  have not found the man who deserves " more . " Yet now there is a crisis . You , Sir , sound like a man who might deserve more . ( I underline the word because I am filled with emotion . ) There are many films in the contemporary cinema which can fascinate serious-minded connoisseurs . I am willing to view one I have already seen , should that be your desire , confident that a second viewing plus heartfelt discussion might reveal depths and complicationswhich .. . Into the file . Watkins imagined drooping hemlines , unresolvedreligious stirrings , description of film as the contemporaryart form pour excellence .

Now you might wonder , if I 'm so bad , and I am , cross my heart , why I need to inquire about some stranger . I 'm glad you asked that wonder . Because all the men around this town is a damn faggot is why . So if you be a damn faggot just looking for a hag , save your postage .

She rang a bell  --  he esteemed the singing of Nina Simone . But she took disco , punk and the obligationsof brinkiness too seriously for him . Watkins wanted to wear the jockey shorts around here . He wanted no prepro/grammed Smiling &; Moaning because the world gave enough of it in the natural avalanche of events . The Grace Jones lady went into the back of the file , even if she therefore decided he was some sort of damn faggot , like all her friends . Thank you for your advertisement .

A kind of Mutual Federation , Sir , not that Total Union which leads to deep wounds .. . The lady sounded healthy and sound , yet she caused him distress . Bethany 's judgment was correct . Back into the file . ... My late husband , the anesthesiologist , left me reasonably well provided for , thanks to a life insurance policy inaugurated shortly before his tragic demise , plus his normal income as a distinguished doctor and the investments and the Keogh Plan authorized under the Internal Revenue laws of the United States of America , and the house happened to be in my name all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little work , gazebo for private conversationsplus meditation singly or in small groups when the children were little . . . .

My late husband , before his unfortunate demise , always said his pride and joy was , firstly , an inner city program of precancer testing for our downtrodden fellow racial citizens , and , secondly , my culinary skills in the gourmet style . . .  |p66Watkins  made an exploratory telephone call to the wok-wieldingwidow . Her late husband , during his unfortunate demise , seemed to have expired of some inexplicable fatal poisoning , mainly due to an erroneous mushroom . She invited Watkins to dinner . Watkins suggested , instead , lunch at an inn by the bay which he had always wanted to try . ( In fact , lunch at the inn had hardly entered his mind , but he had seen an advertisement . ) She informedhim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instead , she would be glad to serve him a light but tangy noontime repast in the gazebo beneath which her husband'sashes were buried . In good weather , they could see downtownEl Cerrito . " Too much trouble for you , " . Watkins pleaded . Instead , just a glass of wine perhaps . He would bring a bottle . But she loved cooking for her friends . Could she count him already , on the basis of this friendly debate before their meeting , as a new friend and lifelong acquaintance ? Hypnotized , he nodded . " Hunh ? " she asked . Dehypnotized , he said unfortunately he was on a strict diet . He ate nothing but protein wafers from a sealed box at lunch  --  a box he carried with him at all times . " Then do come for breakfast , " she suggested . In her full restaurantkitchen she kept a Tiger 's Milk blender for energy emergencies . In her cupboards , a low-cal mix . In her mind 's eye already , a protein shake that would inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he implied eating was out . Her sadness began . Men 's appetites even let her down by phone . May the anesthesiologist rest in peace beneath the garden gazebo supported by insurance , Keogh Plan , investments and a no-mortgage little estatelet ; may the lady avoid autopsy in futureloves . Farewell . Watkins and she were not destined to break toxins together.  |p67He  telephoned Number Two on Bethany 's list , the Iranian professorof sociology . That was easier to manage ; required no airplane or freeway travel ; and if she was nice , he would visit her on his bicycle . They could bicycle together , feeling right at home in Davis , California 95616 , bicycle-use center of the U.S.A. He liked the idea of a sophisticated refugee from the war-torn Middle East , and imagined hearing about winding seaside roads heading down to the sea and crystal beaches , perhaps never again to be enjoyed with youthful abandon . He was sure they both knew about nostalgia , unlike Adela Jenkins . Tristesse had not been Adela 's strong suit . " When ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I live just on the edge of campus , " said Watkins . " I live on the west side of campus . " " I live on the east side . " " I have a bicycle . " " Why do n't you bicycle over ? " " And we 'll have a bicycle ride together . Then we 'll have coffee . Dinner . " " My practice , " said Aviva , " in my country , is first the dinner and then the coffee . " It was agreed , although she had adopted a new country with new practices . Watkins wheeled out his ten-speed . He pumped up the tires . He was preparing to meet a young scholar from a former Switzerland of the Middle East . He decided to take anothershower . This was for the sake of international savoir faire . et vivre after fretting over skinny racing tires . He mounted his bicycle and wobbled off toward the campus , which he wouldp68cross in the company of the fleets of youthful cyclists who , like birds , migrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wobblingeven at takeoff . Although they were mostly pensive and considering their next class , plus the entire future , these airborne creatures sometimesmurmured soft cries , " Hi . . . hi . . . hi . " An amused young woman pedaled alongside with straight bangs cut low across her forehead , dark flat eyes , some sort of white floppy suit which succeeded , thanks to wind , in acting like a clinging garment  --  it must have been soft-woven Indian cloth . Watkins was sure she was lovely and naked under her clothes . It was a thought that used to come to him often as a boy . He tried to banish reactionaryconcupiscence from his heart as she took up speed ( " Hi . " " Hi . " ) . He tried a deeper thought : Would she be as lovely in a slithery polyester pantsuit ? But before he could come to the answer , which might have been no , he heard a metallic pinging clatter and a vocal aria in the path behind him . Ouch , she was singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike skidding , she was down . The concerned lawyer dismounted his Suzuki ten-speed to tend to the wounded . Personal Injury was not his field , but he disbelieved in specialization . She was gently consternated rather than severely hurt , it seemed , for she was saying , " Shit . Shit . Shit . " " Are you okay ? " " Shit and dog shit , " she said , submitting an amended brief . In store for her the future had held contusions and irksomeness . Fortunately the soil was mostly on her wheel . He helped her to her feet , discussing all the while the recent economies in state support of the university , which meant that Grounds &; Maintenancewas cut , the pooping dogs that ran free were not scooped after , standards were being let down all over . " What 's your area ? " she asked . " Coffee , " he said . " Pardon ? " " Oh . The law school  --  I 'm an attorney . I also practice in town . Coffee ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coop , " she said . They walked , wheeling their bicycles . She wheeled hers on the green , asking grass to do the ecologically sound thing , graduallycleaning her spokes and tires . Chlorophyll helps . A bit of unhelpful grass stain on her white Indian-cloth pants . A little flush , a hectic little flush on the cheeks , which were normally brown or tan or Spanishoid . " Are you related to the folk singer , " he asked . " I look like her , " she said , " people say more like Joanie 's sister , but no . My name is you tell me your name first . " " Wat . Watkins . " " Make up your mind . Alicia , " she said , " but since I got acceptedin grad school I 've accepted , contrary to California habit , a last name , too . " This was an impressive speech for a California student . It was full of subordinate clauses and social criticism . UC-Davis was an institution for high achievers . " Alicia Marboro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say it . " He laughed . How many declared themselves to be the Marlboroman ? " You can draw the tattoo on my hand over a cup of French roast , " he said . " That 's a variation . That 's nice . It 's not much of a joke . " " Best I could do on the spot , " he said , " terrified as I was by your near-serious accident . " " I was just going to the library , but there 's mud on my knees  --  well , it has n't rained  --  dust anyway  --  I 'd like to wash . Yucch . Why do n't you come to my cottage and  --  " Never mind the Coop , she would make coffee . Poor Alicia decided to have a bath first . She needed to be scrubbed a bit ; there are parts even a contemporary woman ca n't reach by herself . Watkins helped . He climbed into the bath , an old-fashionedceramic vessel on little metal feet ; claws , rather . Meeting a woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . Was n't a certain Iranian person waiting for him ? In the bath , splashing a bit , Alicia and Watkins performed acts of cleanliness together . Then Alicia and Watkins had a heart-to-heart conversation about Alicia . She had been an industrious young woman in highp70school in Santa Barbara , working as a baby-sitter and finding some housecleaning in the neighborhood . She spent the proceedson necessities , mostly soft drugs like marijuana , ludes , cocaine , LSD and occasionally  --  only on weekends  --  a little PCP . Well , a bit of heroin during the summer doldrums . Finally her parents threw up their tired arms  --  her father a wounded veteran from Korea  --  and advised the police to pick her up . In Juvie Hall she found Jesus . Then she graduated to a " Christian Commune , " but there she fell in love with another Christian delinquent and they left the commune because each , at eighteen years of age , was stronger than Jesus . A few months later she refound the love of learning , and now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present graduate student in French because she could n't see the point of just doing something for the business advantage . Her parents still thought she was nuts . She was interested in her soul  --  Gide , Montherlant , Saint-Exupery and Levi-Strauss , the structural anthropologist , not the jeans . Barthes . Derrida . Some really neat games those boys play . Watkins tried to pretend the names meant something to him . He could pronounce Cordoza , Friendly , Holmes , Lon Fuller , Learned Hand and Felix Frankfurter with the same assurance . " You believe in the missionary position , sir ? " she asked . " Pardon ? Depends . It 's not an article of faith . " " Man on top ? " " I know . There are many circumstances , such as whims ... lower back pain . . . Should there be rules , Alicia ? " " I mean the first time , " she said . Truly , he did not know what was expected of him , nor what he expected of himself . He thought saying nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his silence with close attention . He began to take courage as she took on confidingness . " Well , the first time , I say go ahead , whatever 's right  --  whatever he has on his mind . The first time and there 'll generally be others , wo n't there ? Wo n't I get my chance in due course ? " Since silence had already served him so eloquently , he practicedit a while longer.  | " You 're nice , " she said . " No rules . I like that . " Her mouth made the prayer silently , no rules , and she shook her head with the wonderment of just finding an intelligent gentleman like that , all due to dog shit on her bicycle spokes . Getting to know you is intense work , so then they took anotherbath . She used to be flighty , nervous , irresponsible , capricious , existentielle ( her word ) , but now her affairs tended to endure  --  atleast Watkins was , for her , a two-bath lover . Dainty finally , a foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for her , due to childhood trauma , including the embarrassment of a one-armed father , not that she thought it merely inconsiderate of him to leave an arm in Korea , but still , but still . . . Total union was out . With her , total soul interface presented problems . This , of course , precluded nothingthey could whomp up together on the existential plane . Watkins could accept that . Anyway , he had to live with it . A gentleman must n't force total union on a lady with whom he has taken two baths in rapid succession ; dry puckered skin was a beginning . Then they had a conversation without words . Watkins had not locked his bicycle , leaning it against her little white picket fence , but he did n't care . If it was stolen , it was stolen . She ambled naked , long legged and tanned , with a slight reddeningwhere she had scraped her thigh on that fateful spill , to peek out the window . " Bike 's there , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now I really have to go to the library , " she said . " Thanks for the interlude . " " Interlude ? " he asked . She looked at him with flat , level , gray  --  they were gray in the fading afternoon  --  smiling intelligent eyes and said , " Do n't think more of this than it is . Not that I plan to lose you . I never lose a lover , Watkins . " She had learned efficient behavior in her world of psychopathicequilibrium . That was Watkins 's unspoken judgment . Rapidly he found himself dressed and Alicia dressed and the two of them remounting their bicycles in the last light ofp72day . Only patchy grass grew near her front stoop . Probably all those old lovers , trampling the sod . " You did n't give me your phone number . " " No , " she said , " I did n't , " and pedaled off to the Romance Literature section of the library . He owed an apology to Aviva . He would have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he had never met her , even if some people , certain former addicts and Christians , did n't recognize their duty . Personally , he , Watkins , a member of the California bar , was a man of higher standards . At that level a man can be allowed a few mistakes , a little slippage in the **28;9363;TOOLONG ruins . He dialed Aviva 's number at the first operative corner telephone booth . For some reason he did n't have to refer to the piece of paper . He must have memorized it while he bathed twice in the off-campus cottage of the bicycle lady . His mind was sharp and refreshed . He imagined Aviva impatient , hurt , cultivating a sense of injustice in her apartment which he could not visualize . He could not visualize Aviva , either , although she had sent a Polaroid of a dark Persian beauty in purples and violets . She answered and he asked : " There 's been an accident . Will you forgive me ? " " What accident ? " " It 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , it truly was n't my fault although perhaps some quotient of human error might have been involved  --  " To be or not to be is not the question , he was thinking . Not to be is our certain fate . But while we exist  --  during that brief moment  --  to be ! To be here and festive for a while ! And then okay , we must get ready not to be for the rest of eternity . " What ? " she was asking . " Are we disconnected ? " " Excuse  --  mind wanders because . . . I 'm sorry , a little shock , " he said . He was also thinking : You may come in a lady 's mouth , yet she 's not yours forever . That 's California . That 's modern times . " Will you forgive me ? " he repeated . In her silence he came to a focus on the matter at hand . Hep73stopped thinking about Bethany ( he always thought of her ) , about the bicycle lady , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern breath as she considered the matter . That was only static on the wire , poor telephone maintenancein Area Code 916 , but he knew he was still breathing and he thought of breath . Since he had n't met Aviva yet , he loved her  --  he had hopes . Since he felt apologetic and culpable , he did n't like her very much . " Yes , " she said . The deponent was replying to what ? Oh yes , thanks very much , she was forgiving him for having failed to meet her . The tone was generous . She was even forgiving him for what she did n't know . She must be an Iranian Christian , not a Moslem ; dark armpits , salty and friendly . " Will you see me again ? " he asked . " I have n't seen you the first time , " she said . " I mean  --  " She had probably studied in a religious girls ' school in Teheranwhich taught Aristotelian rather than existential logic . Her throaty Middle Eastern laughter helped his confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good nature he was ready to say I do , I do , I do ; and out of weariness he was ready to add , But I feel kind of tired and headachey tonight , dear . They set a date to try again . Aviva sounded patient and nice . Next Thursday , to be confirmed . He hoped she was not a free-lance guilt artist like his first wife . Or a sunset-loving esthetical skinny like his second , who thought karma was something she could earn by not eating . Or a perfect woman in every way that counted , like Bethany  --  but then did n't want to leave someone else and her perfect family for him . The flat evening sky was like the eyes of some forgotten woman . The high California gray blue shallow sky . The edge of wind coming up and blowing smells of industrial fertilizer from the surrounding farms across the town and campus . A warm dryp74flat wind scraping this earth on which , before white man 's time , so many flowers used to grow that a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , Watkins thought , the natives should n't be this hard to please . He was conforming to the traditions of Eden.  |p75U|pstairs  in the greeny redwood mall where Watkins kept his office , the clever old lady , Yorda Coblentz  --  a faculty widow  --  who served as his secretary sang out , " Hi ho , Mr. Solo Practitioner , a client has been calling . " He noticed the continuing present tense and cocked his bushy solo-practitioner eyebrow at her . He liked making Yorda happy  --  the tired skin could still blush through its mourning and leatheriness  --  with friendly , almost flirtatious gesture . Her husband had been Chair of the Music Ed faculty ; she seemed more like a colleague 's wife than a half-time employee . She wiggled like a younger woman , which in her heart she was . " Elaine Jones . She said to tell you Elaine Positano . Imperitivato , as they say in a little-known Swiss mountain lan-guage . " " Call her back in English , Yorda . " " Pronto , Mr. S. P. " Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said well it 's difficult even more difficult sometimes the second time and he said he understood from dire experience himself and Elaine said she needed help and he said most of us do and Elaine said when could she come in , and he said he had a lecture to prepare and she said When then ? and he said okay , right now , since this lecture was one he gave at the same time every winter quarter and he could use last year 's notes and Elaine said she was grateful , she knew he would come through for her , and he said , Do n't , not yet , and Elaine said she would be there directly . When she hung up , Watkins tried to organize some recollectionsof her . Elaine Jones , Elaine Positano . Elaine what ? Some/thing previous . She did n't say , " I 'll be right there , " she said , " I 'll be there directly . " A few years ago she was married to Pete Positano in the med school . Now she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a manufacturer of solar panels , something in that line , but not a periodontist . Bigger money , bigger fun . Well , it would all come clear in due time . Due time , in Davis , nice small California town , was twenty minutes later . The nice thing about small towns , Watkins reflexivelythought , is the getting there and parking , plus that marveloussense of American community . ( I 'm glad I did n't take the offers from the Washington or New York or San Francisco firms , I 'm glad I took the academic not even the judicial road , I 'm glad I live in bicycle-riding Davis , where people sell solar panels and heat collectors to each other , I 'm glad the former Mrs. Positano feels free to call on me when another marriage shorts out ... ) Just before Elaine arrived there was a call from the dean saying , " Bakke again , " which he often said intead of hello , since minority admission and the problem of publicity about it  --  issue was the preferred word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools of Medicine and Law famous . There was this black kid who was not doing too well , managed to squeeze through as a freshman , now a sophomore , normally an easier year , and since Watkins was such a nice , friendly , easygoingfellow  --  he was not , of course , that was mere oil of dean  --  maybe he would talk to the kid and see if he might just sort of voluntarily withdraw and become a disc jockey or a minority entrepreneur of some creditable type because he was n't dumb , he just was n't cut out to apply himself to a whole bunch of taxing details , such as the law . . . . Would Watkins like to take on a little task of counseling here ? " No thanks , Frank , " Watkins said . " Just thought I 'd ask . You used to be so helpful . " " This is the eighties , Frank . God helps those who help them-selves . " " You know , Watkins , sometimes you know what ? Sometimes I long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Wat . "  |p77When  Frank hung up , Watkins strolled toward the outer office to welcome Elaine Jones , remembering how even during the Sixties he knew he had liked that decade and would learn to like it better as time went on . " Of course , of course , of course I remember you well and warmly , " he said to the overthin , overnicotined , overmarried woman who was trying to look both troubled and sociable for an old friend . " I was happier when I knew you , " she said . " I was happy to get dumped by Pete . I 'm not happy to be dumping Will Jones . " " Come in and we 'll explore the paradox . " Watkins did his office cordial routine . He was a professional and could do it with his heart broken or bored . Uncordially , internally , he added : Up to a point . Up to a point , my dear . During these difficult times of the Eighties he was , truth to tell , reluctant to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own regrets , griefs and losses to excess . These were selfish times , and this was to be regretted . " Please speak up , clear and to the point , Mrs. Jones , Elaine  --  not that I do n't remember our days of nonprofessional acquaintanceand lots of banter . Years ago now . " " I understand , " she said . " Hi , Wat . " She composed herself . Her fingers on one hand snaked around the fingers of the other , all twisty in her lap . The wedding ring was removed . Mrs. Jones , Elaine Something-Positano-Jones , explained that she had lost her passion for solar panels . She realized she had a completion problem ; that is , about finishing things , including men . When she was married to Pete Positano , she had started the definitive research work on sodomy in suburbia  --  " buggery , " she explained parenthetically , " but not merely as a form of contraception "  --  because she wanted to please Pete . At first he encouraged her . His mother thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps that 's how it turned out . The subtitle , she said , was Above and Behind the Call of Duty , and some of the chapters included , at least one of them did , the title " I 'll Be Turning Around to Look for You . " " You do comedy , too , " Watkins said . " I guess I was serious about pleasing Pete , that 's how I am.  |p78You  remember those days , Wat . The stylish thing would have been something sensational like wife-swapping or group sex , but that would have been wrong . All the spouses were taking up easy projects . I looked for something fresh . I looked to hold Pete 's attention . " " Okay . What 's the problem ? " Pete 's attention was not holdable . So she gave up the book , to which he wanted to add his name as cocollaborator  --  a redundancy  --  buthe was given to and liable for redundancies , which always irritated her , like hiccuping in bed . . . " Where was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory when she sailed forth again under her own steam . She dropped the book when Pete found a skinnier , more boyish pair of girl 's buttocks to fulfill his research needs , to reeducate and form and move . So Elaine started a real estate course and met this advanced builder . And then came Aloysius ( " Solar Deal " ) Jones and she put buggerybehind her in favor of an energy-saving future , plus tax write-offs and a condominium at Tahoe and terrific fun trips to see congressmen in Washington , D.C. Al was both hip and high powered , natural but blow-dried , a doper but also a man who worked within the system . Elaine liked that . That was for her . She learned to ski ; it 's not so difficult . She tried to have a baby , and almost did . You ca n't get everything was one of the lessons she learned . " Maybe trying like that , " she remarked , nose reddening , eyes reddening , " is what kills it . " " You mean your feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw it , to conceive a child  --  ? " " I tried . I tried so hard . He said people could n't make photovoltaicbatteries commerical , either , not in this country , so not to worry . But I tried so goddamn hard . " " And you blame yourself ? " " He was so sweet . He helped . He let me do everything . Oh , Watkins , I fucked him silly ! " Watkins patted her hand . " But one thing he neglected to inform me , " she said . " Hep79did n't tell me . A few months before we got married he had a vasectomy . " Watkins deliberated , continuing the domestic-relations mode into which he had switched for her , but not speaking the words aloud : It probably means all your efforts were in vain . " So he made me feel like a failure , and all the time he  --  " " That has the look of deceit to me , " Watkins said . " I admit , if you 're seeking grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olden times , that has the look of annulment . Would you like some coffee or a banana ? " She was snuffling and ducking her head miserably , cutely ( a little ) , and uttering , " Both . Al said photovoltaic solar storagebatteries worked in the Negev , but not in this climate , not yet . But they will  --  " She stuck a dab of Kleenex to her nose . He got two cups , moved to the maker , started the maker , watched the lights go into Making Mode , opened the little fridge , no banana ; looked on top of the little fridge , only one banana . " I 'll divide it with you while we wait a second for this pretty fair coffee , Elaine , " he said . " Never mind . Just coffee . " Watkins silently peeled , looked at her , gestured the naked banana toward her with a final offer , took a bite of the end which he normally cut off . He had read that one of the symptoms of potassium deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Since he had long suffered from existential dread , and the university health plan did not carry it on their list of approved diseases or conditions , not even ranking it with the allergies , he ate a banana regularly every work day . He skipped Saturdays and Sundays , when he ate eggs at a little brunch place on D Street . So perhaps what he felt was iiuit existential dread , being banana-potent , but potassium-proof loneliness and isolation . It occurred to him that weekends were the worst times of all and therefore they really should be the banana times . While he contemplated internal domestic crisis , Elaine Jones contem/plated him . " You 're gone , " she said . " Wow . You 're not here at all . " " I 'm not charging you for this conference , " he said . " Please continue . " " Are you treating me like a child ? In this situation I find myself , I suppose I 'm not an old friend from the good days but a client , am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're nice . " Pat pat , hug hug , he thought , beaming with lack of knowledge of how to respond . " Why not just tell me the facts in a businesslike domesticrelationsmanner , followed by a definition of the problem concerningAl ? Al Jones ? As you see it and how to resolve the problem as you understand it , Elaine . " All that without wheezing or panting for breath . She sketched out the quick design of her marriage . A lot of standing in mud on construction sites . Four-wheel drive vehicles . Guys in plastic hats with lumber company names on them . Energy-saving sun statistics . Panels and mirrors . Faggot architectsmaking kissy sounds at her and only meaning hello by it . " That was n't how it was supposed to be this time , " she remarked . " How was it supposed to be ? " Silence . " Elaine ? " She began to cry as she described roaring fires in fireplaces , bottles of champagne , skiings and holdings of hands over vistas of sparkling snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never like that , " Watkins said . He remembered very early days with his first wife , before they were married . Monterey . Beer and abalone on the beach . He remembered early days with his second wife , even after they were married . Paris , Venice . More abalone on the beach , plus white wine . He remembered romantic moments with his daughterwhen she was the world 's sweetest five- or six-to-eleven year old , and they sat at cafes over ice cream and confided in each other . He thought how hard it was to make Elaine seem foolish when he was , give or take a few hormones and fixations , thep81same kind of persistent yearner . All they both wanted was the merging of souls before fireplaces that did n't smoke too much , over ice cream that did n't spill in laps , with a partner that never caught on , in a time that never ends , in a world that never was . " True understanding , " Elaine was saying . " To care and cherishforever , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few terrible errors out of pure hoping and dreaming , just loneliness and missing my loved person , like that one time with the busboy at Tahoe . " " These things happen , " said Watkins . " He was in Sacramento talking to the goddamn lobbyist again . I was snowed in . The busboy was cute . I did n't want to , but what choice did I have ? " " How 'd he find out ? " Watkins asked . " Suspected , but it was only an assumption . Some jerkoff in the restaurant wrote him a letter . There was no reason for this  --  no avalanche or life-threatening which would cause me to risk all I hold dear , so I convinced him it did n't happen . Watkins , I was sincere . When everything was perfect , which it was , why would I risk throwing it away , even for a moment , with a pimple-facedbusboy ? " " You would n't . " " He believed me , but the damage was done . I offered to retraceour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the whole trip  --  the pink cheeks ... " " You ca n't go back , " Watkins said . " You 've always got to go forward , not that I do n't try , too , Elaine . " " But I can ! I did ! Because that 's how it was for us and that 's why I was willing to try again ! " Watkins was willing to learn . In his own case , he found difficultiesin keeping a marriage going , either with the wife he did n't like or with the wife he liked . They tended to dim out on him . There was an ache of anger with his first wife , and an ache of loss with his second , and an ache of time passing when he thought of his daughter , but these were pains he did not seek to dwell on . After all , life is still to be lived , and the rest is history.  |p82Even  getting to be , say , a state Supreme Court justice only confirmed the future if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there was something lacking in this analysis . Watkins looked seriously into Elaine 's eyes until she wondered what he was up to , stopped crying , dabbed , and then he could ask , " How long was it perfect , Elaine ? " " For two whole weekends , plus the Thanksgiving holiday , Watkins . " They sat there , sipping coffee from Cost Plus mugs . Watkins felt the need of another banana . In his head , not his stomach . His stomach felt tight against his belt from the previous banana , but his head felt light , dizzy and unanchored in this final fifth of the twentieth century , badly requiring Chiquita , craving Dole . He began to tell Elaine Jones how intelligent she always seemed to him . Actually , as Elaine Positano she used to seem cute and sexy , and therefore bright ; intelligent was n't the word , but it was the word he used . He thought , he hoped it might please her . " Perhapswe ask too much of love and marriage , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Naturally his business was not counseling but representation ; however , the two things are so intertwined you would n't believe it , Elaine . ( " N0 ! " ) He suggested considering a serious try at reconciliation , includingtherapy , or a different kind of therapy to supplement what already had n't worked out . Maybe even trying to reverse the vesicular litigation , if that 's what it 's called . Silence . She gazed on him with blue eyes that had known both deceit and disappointment in the high Sierras . " I 've considered it , " she said . So that 's what the silence meant . " I 've considered it for months now . Since Thanksgiving . When we had representativesof lending institutions over for baked ham instead of family for turkey . Okay , so family was far away . But Golden West Savings and Loan ? But raisins in sugar sauce , all mooshy , Watkins ? " " No ski weekend afterwards ? " " Washington afterwards to see a congressperson about tax helps . Al is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shelters , write-offs , depreciation allowances , and I thought it was going to be fur rugs in the ski house . I do love my very own bearskin and a fireplace . So he got me a ski condo on time-sharing . That was n't how I thought it 'd be  --  some stewardess'shair in the sink when it came our turn to share was how it was . " She stopped to breathe . " I did n't even go to the Ramada Inn and pick up some busboy . I deny it . So now I want severancepay  --  you know , for when the going gets severe . " Watkins considered the matter . He put a space of silence between them . He appeared to be thinking . " You really tried , " he said at last , " but the problem is , I want to disqualify myself , being a friend of your previous husband , Pete . " She went blank . " Pete Positano , " he explained . " You may think this awfully finicky of me , Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to do them at all anymore , since my own last one . I think you need a younger , tougher representation . You 're a plucky person  --  " " Plucky but unlucky , " she said . " Cut the crap . " " It 's not a personal judgment . " " You 're turning me down . Not only by men but even by lawyers I 'm rejected . " " Come on , now , there 's a problem . " He organized his thoughts to explain himself minimally . Fully was not the ticket here . He resuggested reconciliation . ( " No ! Try to listen to me ! " ) He suggested that okay , in that case , he still had to disqualify himself . " But you always did divorces . " " I used to . Now I only do them for myself . " " Do me , too , Wat . " " Because of Pete , who used to be your husband  --  " " I remember now . He wo n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " " You mean too much interest ? You do n't make much sense , Watkins . " " Whatever . I think you 're half right about that , which goes to ' how , I 'd like to send you to another attorney , perhaps a woman -I 'm doing mostly academic work now . "  | " Watkins , you 're stouthearted enough for me . Plucky , is that your word ? The more you deny me , the more I want you . " Is this the way of the world ? Watkins wondered . Although he was n't playing games , except very earnestly and in general , and that 's fate , he toyed with the pipe on his desk . It was now a paperweight . He had given up smoking it ten years and a marriageago . " I 'm not free enough of feeling , my dear . I might have some crippling sympathy for your husband , whatever sort of wretch he might be . I ca n't . " Elaine Jones stood up . He noticed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designer label stood stiffly up . " Then you sure ca n't , Watkins , " she remarked sharply . " I 'll have to find a man who can . " " I 've been married myself and divorced . You do n't need this explanation . I 'm not yet free of feeling  --  " " That 's okay . Good boy , good boy . " Let her hit him all she liked . " I 'm not free of some wounds myself  --  " " You said that already . " " So nice to see you again , " he murmured , showing her out . As he followed her to the open redwood stairway leading down to the courtyard of the Pacific Heartland Mall , he touched her elbow and shouldered next to her and tried to take back a bit of control . " Elaine . I would like to offer you some sage fatherly counsel from an old friend and acquaintance . Perhaps you should try your best with the husband you have , since  --  " " Shove it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severance and freedom . But let me quote a wise person . Keep what you have , this person said , because it 's no more better than what you used to have and no worse than what you 're going to have . " " Can it , freeze dry it , compost it . " " Well , that 's a natural reaction . Sorry . Wait a second . " And this time some urgency in his voice made her turn to look into his face . " You do n't , Elaine , you do n't ever put ads in the paper , do you ? " " Huh ? "  | " I mean , for a lover or a friend . I mean , for loneliness and the blues ? " She gazed at him as if he had taken leave of his senses . " I guess you do n't then , " he said . " What kind of a remedy is that ? Insane to do a thing like that , also , either . "  |p87Nevertheless  , it was important not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He owed it to his hopes and dreams and ... and .. . to accept Aviva 's generous offer of forgiveness , which might not be repeated . He hoped he was not being a good old puppy just because Bethany asked him to . How excessive to find his salvation only for Bethany , even if it suited her convenience and conscience . By rights it should suit Watkins , too . Damn right . Tell ' em , counselor . After a couple of days , during which he hoped the impact of flowers , candy and a bottle of white wine would sink in , along with whole phrases of apology , he called Aviva again . " Are n't you nice ! " she said . " A rain of keepsakes ! Makes me feel you 're ashamed . " " Shame starts us off on the right foot , does n't it ? " he asked . I ! is loins sweetened with the thought of an Iranian stranger , related to Zoroaster or the Pahlavis . Perhaps strangers are the key to familiarity . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociologist might have all sorts of wonderful data to share . But he forbade himself to do too much thinking . He had reached the other side of his age , where God had blessed him with health and desire , misery and loneliness , and now he should just coast with God 's blessings , plus Bethany 's . Since the gift of intelligence had n't sweetened life for him . Love is a warm blanket . Pull it up to the head and it exposes the feet . So he said he would go to see Aviva anyway and this time hep88did , feeling the guilt of not really wanting to , yet really wanting to , thudding in his middle-aged heart . He was healthy ; good Kaiser Plan physical  --  passed ; this was not a warning . He was thudding along with everyone else who dreams of love and thuds scared he might or might not find it . Hi , Aviva , he would say , I 'm Watkins , you do n't look so Persian . . . No , better fix that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . No , How about just , Pleased to meet you at last ? He fulfilled something like these plans for the opening felicities , and she said , " I 'm a woman , not a lady . I 'm Iranian even if you do n't know what we look like  --  you expected a veil ? a mustache ? I 'm from an old Maronite family , if you 've heard of that . Super French . Really awfully Gallic in our traditional vibes . " " I 'm sure , " he said politely . " My father and brothers would take you down to the wadi , tie you to an olive tree and castrate you if this were home sweet home , " she said . " I 've been somewhat Americanized , however . " " I sincerely hope so , " he said . " Do you like the Platters and the Coasters ? I collect oldies but . goodies . In my country , as a girl , I used to adore them . . . I can still smell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those dynamite hits . Dusty diamonds were my favorites from the beginning  --  the Eberle Brothers , too , come wailing over those stony hills . In those days we were n't a backward country . We had our own Christian pirate radio station . That 's what got me interested in American sociology and why things are as they are  --  societies in transition  --  am I talking too much ? " " No , " he said . " Neither are you , " she said . " We 're each nervous in his or her own way . " " Bethany ! " he cried , raising his eyes to the blue sky of Iran in the form of a stippled plaster California nonearthquakeproof ceiling . " What 's that ? " Aviva asked . It was a prayer for mercy . " Song from when we were little tykes , " he said.  | " I do n't remember that one . Who did it ? Maybe it was a number they did n't play on Christian Pirate Radio . Bethany ? How did it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It just went . I do n't remember except how much I liked it . " " Too bad , " she said . " I like to listen to the oldies but goodies , especially when I 'm lonesome for my country , which some Moslemscall Eastern Iraq . Somehow when you hear them later for the first time , it is n't the same . In sociology we call that the nostalgia effect . Time gives a certain resonance . It gives a certain thickness to history . Do you realize these things in California as an adult ? " " I do , " he said . " My students do n't , they lack the depth , but I 'm so glad you do . Shall we be friends ? " Confused , he answered . " Of course . We are . " He looked into her eyes and she smiled . There was sadness in her gaze as she took him in through the eyes -- an erotic takingin . She expected a mountain prince or bandit captain , with treasure in caves and gold-flecked Crusader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a darting hammer-headed fish for a penis . She expected Swiss bank accounts transferred in time from Teheran , a darting hammer-headed intelligence . She expecteda wild chap with a knife in his boot and a calculator for a heart . Instead , there was this longing middle-aged chap with the remnants of marital fleshiness not quite jogged off . And because she was good , she was a good person , she had responded to his advertisement , she had gotten herself into this , she was determined not to disappoint him and , more important , not to disappoint herself . She was ready to go through with it . To Watkins , her voice was red silk . It rustled like red silk . There was a quality to it beyond her education . Of course , these days it was n't racial . But that red silk , it was there , rustling . He was ready to go through with it . Neither was sure they would go through with it although both were ready . Perhaps both were merely half ready . In the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , ready , but not quite . " Pardon ? " he asked . She was reaching for his fly with her right hand . " I find this the preferable way to be friends , " she said , unzipping , exploring , beginning . He said little . She brought both hands into it . Was this anotherCalifornia fad , sweeping the state ? This grown woman , too ? Later she said , " Now we work backwards through time to discover our own radiance . Let us visualize together , Watson . " " Watkins , " he said , gently correcting her without asking if Aviva was really an Iranian name . It sounded almost Israeli to him . Perhaps , in the fullness of time , better he should n't ask . What they had done they had mostly done standing up , only toppling together at the conclusion . " We had fed the heart on fantasies ; the heart 's gone brutal from the fare , ' " he remarked , quoting Yeats . " What fair ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chocky cake from a farmer , his wife made it herself . I adore your folkways , Watson . " He endured this conversation with Number Two on the list , Aviva , but what he thought was Bethany , Bethany , why have you forsaken me ? Sacrilege it was ; sacrilege , too , to refer to God when he only wanted a woman ; he would do with the death of God , the killing of God , the torment and torture of God if only he could be restored to Bethany , have his love again close , warm and silent , even a few hours in the afternoon and on a rare evening of Dental Society meeting , periodontal subsection ; no , , he wanted her for himself , only her , living together with him , married to him ; but yes , he would accept the old terms , waiting in his cold and womanless house until she called , came cheerily from her husband and children and many family and athletic duties ; came to him , came to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aviva had been so good to him . She had met him more than halfway . " Your heart 's gone brutal from what fair ? " she asked . " Is thatp91country punk ? There 's this kind of lyric 's coming in now , sort of Dylan gospel pure , but mean , I 'll bet you dollars to dough-nuts . " " Would you like to make something hot to drink ? " he asked . " What are you doing ? " " Biting your neck . " He decided it was incumbent upon him at this time to behave in a playful , relaxed and perhaps a bit romantic manner . Therefore he winked and pressed his teeth , sheathed by lips , against her country-loving Middle Eastern throat . " I 'm after blood , " he growled . She handed him a plum and laughed . That 's the ticket . The nice fruit , tart and sweet , distracted him for a millisecond . Then he returned it to her , and she also bit , saying something about its being refreshing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand sliding up her blouse , both his hands seizing plums ; his lips and hands were sliding and tearing down her body , peeling off silky red things , his mouth fastened to her and him wondering what she 'd say now in her red-silk voice : " It 's refreshing " ? And he was crammed into her , his fat fishy thing , his fingers , her lingers , the small death momentarily achieved by specific plan and design . He wondered if he should n't take up drinking . She gave him a moment of rest . " You 're phallic , " she remarked . " That 's a macho stage among middle-aged men in my country , too . " " " IThank you , " he said . Why not insist it was a compliment ? Better than treating it either as an insult or a topic for discussion . Oddly enough , he felt her heart beating hard , hectic in light panic , like sand kicked and scattered . The sweet world , Watkins thought , is soaked in hope . And trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping with night-lights and smiling parents who tiptoe in to peek clown on them . Beyond my travels here and there , with women who cause parts of my body to act alert , some great happiness is sulking because I have n't yet discovered it . Happiness , I 'll find you ! My mother , despite everything , yes !  |p92My  father , despite everything , who waked me gently by touching my forehead with his stiff fingers , yes ! My wives ! Whom I comforted , whom I comforted , who comfortedme in the middle of the night , and who then learned not to love me , yes ! Happiness ! I 'll surely track you down ! Aviva 's gaze was fond . " You 're an odd person , Watson , which is about what I should suspect from the source . You drift in and out . I mean mentally , you have so much on your mind . Yet do n't you know what socialization really is , my dear ? You must . Else you would not have placed an advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms , warm palms , almost tenderly . Yes , tenderly . Yes , regretfully . " I too , " she was saying , " I too , coming from an obsessed people and an obsessed part of the world , divided as we are , divided as you and I are , know what you know . I know what obsession is , but it does n't help . "  |p93He  woke the next morning with the burnt-rice smell of fertilizer blowing over the entire world from the farms around Davis and Woodland , and then he heard the hoot of the train to Sacramento , that **31;9393;TOOLONG sound , and the scrape of a branch outside his window . He lay there till the train was gone . The branch scratched , scratched , to be let in . He had often thought of trimming it a little , but he liked something green and growing out there by his condominium town house window , no matter what troubles grew on the other side . He would let it scrape and never trim . And as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . It was a morning of meditation for Watkins . Poets might write poems on such early hours of smells and dawning light and calmly troubled world view . The problem about lyrical release was : Watkins had some difficult thoughts concerning himself which seemed to come from afar ; that is , his needs were vivid , but the judgment of his desires was harsh . As he stared at the new light , heard the branch , he made cool afar appraisals of Watkins , as if he were someone possibly to be taken on as a client . Aviva was right and Watkins believed it important to do something about errors in character which were evident even to an intelligent horny Iranian social anthropologist . Whether it was Bethany he sought or true love in general  --  another mother for himself at this late date , or devotion from his faraway chil-d ren or revenge for past sorrows  --  he was seeking what he should not seek . Something about being Watkins , a man , was in undersupply with him these days . If only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his pants , that his moral being was on the wrong goddamn track . Pete Positano came to mind . Pete did look young and wired and sure of his games . If his ways of ripening character were not a solution , at least they were something to do . They tried . Watkinswondered if he should n't make contact again  --  old Pete , whom he had been glad to avoid . It would n't hurt to try . It was a morning of meditation . On a day of earth smells and the sounds of good America , Watkins felt judged by his own bad choices . The searching out of one woman after another seemed almost promiscuous to him , no matter how serious his purpose . If someone else did it  --  definitely dumb . Postcoital tristesse haunted him ten hours and a sleep after coitus . It was n't fair , but maybe it was just . Another deep effort should be called forth . It was time to follow the road always pointed with such enthusiasmby his fellow professional , Doc Pete Positano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ph.D . ( Counselingand Psychology ) , University of Southern California . Skilled Interpersonal Groups . Industrial and Individual Restructuring . Day &; Night Service . Watkins retrieved the card from his desk , and the advertisementinserted in the Pacific Sun , " as a probe , " Pete said , " to see if there 's a needful and aware public out there . I do n't give a fuck what they think at the med school , I 've got tenure . " During the convulsions of the late sixties , Pete had been taken on by the medical faculty to teach Interpersonal Relationships ( one of his grandparents , he said , was black , although no one could prove it ) ; through an apparent blip on the screen  --  be fair , Pete did publish a lot  --  he had been granted tenure , although his course was no longer required for entering first-quarter freshperson family care students . Dr. Positano was the last individual on campus to wear tiedyedtee shirts . He had cured himself of strabismus by FlutterTouchAura Self Therapy ( planned masturbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dudgeon or repose , when his left-brain-controlled right eye tended to turn inward toward the Spirit . He had recently launched his **25;9426;TOOLONG Campaign to expand his psyche . In the 198os Pete resembled the California condor , a licensed and attested Endangered Species , a survivor of the Summer of Love . But he moved as if he still sensitively and caringly owned the entire " goddamned beautiful fucking world . " For Watkins , in this small town , it came with his life 's programto be on first-name terms with ( intimate with ) a professionaltenured licensed revolutionary . While students sometimesrevered him , and other people thought him silly , Watkins did not exactly revere him and thought him not merely silly . Pete was unpredictable , conventional , backward in his forwardnessand a distraction to the routines of a high-achievement campus . Watkins had kept his distance lately . He was aware of divorces , marriages , ever-increasing mental health . He rememberedwhen Pete lived in a commune  --  that long ago . But they were still colleagues . They had both lost wives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I lost my lover again , Wat . I 've got to face the fact there must be something in me that wanted to lose my lover . I chose defeat in marriage , Wat , just as some choose to starve in Africa or flake out in DC-11s . But there is something in me that feels , I do n't know , yes I do  --  a period of mourning and regroupment coming on . You know , when I wake up on Sundays , alone , which I did last month , the thing I had like a big take-on is : Suicide as a Viable Alternative . I was thinking of writing a piece for High Times . " " And then what ? " " And then I thought you could want to join my specially chosen , but it 's not elitist , group of fellow sufferers , Watkins . A nonsexist men 's group . Are you up for dealing with our problems , and only faculty or administration allowed ? We 'll have to keep it secret or the femmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's group then , " Watkins said . " You hit the nail on the head . But nonsexist . " " It 's time , " said Watkins . " You mean you 'll try anything now ? " " Almost . A few exceptions . "  |p96Pete  sighed . " Me too . I too have had failures although I 'm in the Success Mode , a creative time of solidarity with my being . It raises all the issues . For example , what success has done to my relationships with a kind of fresh young thing I used to like . Let me go into deep background on this . I always know when it 's about to be over . My lover says her birthday 's next Wednesday . So I get the birthday present . And on Friday she breaks up with me . Once I got back together with a femme who broke up with me in March and now it was December and she said her birthdaywas two days after Christmas . So she got the Christmas present , the birthday present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be as old as Adele Davis was , but she 's only twenty-eight . My luck . " " That kind of problem I never have , " Watkins said . " My ladies never have birthdays at all . " " That 's your problem , Watkins . " " They 're married . They ca n't bring strange presents into the house . " " It 's worse . I call that predatory . " " Yours is not predatory , Pete . She 's just grasping is all . " " I said it . Do n't accuse me . I 'm a man of power and I do n't take to accusation . " He made a motor-running , purring sound , like a sleeping cat ; a jungle cat , king of the Coop coffeehouse . " Playing with ourselves in that cozy room , " Pete said , " we 'll get to be like boys before they 're ruined by masculinity  --  " " Rah rah , we 'll have endless hours of delight , " Watkins said . " Yeah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wat . We stop at nothing . If you want results , that 's how it is . Do you want results ? " " That 's what I seem to be into , Pete . " " And there 's the trouble with you , Watkins . No patience . No hanging out . " Watkins wondered if his methodical voyages toward Bethany'spen pals was a sign of not hanging out and of being impatient . He decided not to defend himself . " We live in the microchip world , " Pete was saying , " but we must cling to our instincts . They are telling us something valid.  |p97About  love , someone was right when he said it . If it 's not easy , it 's impossible . So what we 've got to do with great effort is learn to take it easy . " Watkins sighed . Whoever said that bothered him . " I only emit what I feel , " Pete said . " The truth . " Watkins met his friend 's eyes , although Pete was better practicedat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still meet Watkins 's eye with his other . Where the anima was located . Through which the karma was transmitted . In tune with the radiance . Pete winked and Watkins was suddenly , God help him , filled with the hope of male fellowship . He said , " You might even be right , Pete . Did n't you just say the truth will make us free if we do n't work too hard to find it ? I 'll bet it 's worth a try . When do we gather together in the search for truth ? " Behind HumanHouse , formerly CUC , Campus UnderstandingCenter , formerly the 4-H Club , a garden used to grow . Now it had gone apocalyptic  --  shriveled vines , brown stalks , crusted lumps of soil and footprints hardened into Paleolithic relics of scampering nonsexist ravagers . It was supposed to be French Intensive , but when Ronald Reagan was elected , the gardener decided to switch over to Business Administration . Instead of the eternal vegetable cycle , modern life was being redeemed indoors . Watkins studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to him : MEN 'S ANTI-SEXIST POTLUCKBRING FOOD TO SHARE , IDEAS TO DISCUSS , AND TOYS TO PLAY WITH . BRING SONGS TOSING . BRING HOPES AND FEARS . Before trying radical psychic surgery with Pete , he thought he might explore his destiny in the Campus Fellowship Circle . He needed to get used to unprivacy . He browsed among the materials on the battered kitchen table at the door : to knowp98himself as a man today , in this troubled world which consists of men , women and sometimes children , in this difficult place of ambition , hope , dream , desire and yearning for calm , where it is so difficult to find significant nonsexist , nonracist , nonelitist , nonageist , nonweightist , non-IQist , nonfreewillist connection . ... The reason for the kitchen table with the chipped zinc was that a wooden one had been unilaterally liberated and **28;9453;TOOLONG by the Native Americans for Justice CommandoBraves when they raided HumanHouse one night in search of typewriters , photocopiers , desks , coffee machines , dope and miscellaneous office supplies to furnish the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Perpetual Indulgence , an order of male nuns , to dance over to HoganHouse to try to reason with the Native American rip-off folks . The Sisters , garbed in peaceful black robes with white cowls and lavender headbands , were held off at the culvert by bows and arrows . Because they were willing to share nicely with palefaced persons , especially male sisters , who came calling with peace in their hearts , the Native Americans did not shoot either the arrows or their backup shotguns , nor did they seize them for prison-style , underprivileged , class-oppressed , rear-entry gang rape . ( Sodomism was not their thing . They called it Palefaceism , and they preferred corn bread . ) Sister Darrell of the Order of Perpetual Indulgence returned with the terrific idea of using Goodwill kitchen tables for furniture instead of that greasy old mahogany stuff , indicating acceptance of women 's formica world and repentance for all the shitwork which went into deforestation activities . Darrell 's proposalpassed by unanimous abstention . Watkins wondered if he might not be a little old  --  not old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this was an ecumenical drop-in world , where faculty , graduates and even retired industrial farmers from Woodland occasionally passed through to refurbish their interpersonality . Watkins did not put himself above any younger frayed souls . The man that advertisesmust learn to conceive of himself in a new way . Watkins could not yet conceive of advertising for legal clients.  |p99He  was too old to be doing what he needed to do , which was to hang out in HumanHouse . Yet in HumanHouse Watkins stood , by a chipped Goodwill table , where others also browsed and poured from the coffeepot . A sturdy young man in Levi 's , boots , beads , undershirt  --  one of the generation which has never worn a jacket without snaps or a zipper  --  began to argue for casual sex as a nice way to say hello . " I have sex with certain people , I call them up , they want to , also  --  it 's nothing heavy , it 's not what you call exploitive or traumatistic . We relate . We sip a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch can . What 's the big deal ? What 's the evil here ? " When no one replied , he offered a possible answer : " None that I see . " A group had sprung up in the room where men waited to sign up for groups . Watkins did n't mind . He was n't planning to give his name or share his life , but he did n't mind waiting for Pete Positano among these honest avowals . The sturdy moral person was brooding . He had discovered thoughts on his mind . " I 'd like to find a real woman , " he said , " a weight lifter who is really beautiful is what I 'd like and we can really be together . Is that too much to ask ? " " Really , " said another butch young man . " We 're all kind of pcergroupy as far as that goes . We want to get together with somebody in the cold , cold night . " Watkins tried to remember his cold , cold nights in Davis , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp , quiet and lonely for sure , and the branch scratching at his window . Again he wondered if he was too old for this sort of thing . And now he answered the question : Absolutely . On the Native American Memorial Formica Kitchen Table a container of potluck stew was congealing . Waxy white stuff on iop . When it was heated , the fat would melt , grow yellow and friendly . The coffeepot was spitting hot water and coffee over the formica . No one paid any attention . Finally Tony , a young poet , grabbed a towel . " I like to feel like your traditional woman sometimes , activating the mother-space in me , to maximize thep100femininity options of my being . " Then he wiped . " You really dig wiping , do n't you ? " the man in Levi 's asked . " You got a thing for cleaning , do n't you ? " " I acknowledge that which you just uttered , " Tony said . " Hey , Watkins ? " called the youth at the switchboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , gray eyes , quiet vibes ? Pete just phoned and says he 's sorry , he 'd like to reschedule , there 's an emergency . He hopes you 'll understand . He 's giving comfort and support at the crisis center  --  I think it 's a little Big See problem . " " Big See ? " Watkins asked . " Cancer , " said the duty man at the switchboard . " He was asking your forgiveness and he 'll reschedule . " For potluck Watkins brought an appetite . For talk he brought words . As a beginning of the joyous inward struggle toward truth , he brought this little bagful of problems all clanking together in his head . Well , fellas , here he was . And he was ready to help others if they could help him , please . It was not that he was another lost soul . It was merely that he had not yet been found . " I hate cliches and jargonist expression , " a young man said over his knitting as he personed the reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ca n't people just tell it like it is , instead of always trying to interface with their projections ? " Another young man was working his crayons in an Oriental rug coloring book . The man on the telephone was saying , " Peer pressure is some of the heaviest peer pressure going down these days . Personally , a feelable option for me might be the example of a respected East Bay mystic  --  you know , the guy who might or might not be the son of Shiva  --  you know , the laughing one  --  " The warm sun poured through the windows . Greenhouse effect in the California dampness always made Watkins sleepy . " I feel , I feel . . . " the young man with a weight lifter 's torso was declaring , " if you could do away with the whole erection-ejaculationtrip , I call it the endless software loop , you could havep101many multiple mental orgasms in sequence . An erection is pain , you know . It hurts and a person craves relief . Pumping iron is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sex is a power trip they laid on us for their own purposes . " " To propagate the race ? " Watkins said , feeling he ought at least try to contribute . " The gods ? Or women ? " " For whatever reason , " the hefty young man said . " I do n't want to get racist about it . " He almost smiled . " I appreciate your response to a stranger . " " I 've got nothing to hide , " said the weight lifter . " Are you waiting for someone ? " " Pete Positano . " " Doctor Positano has a tardiness syndrome . The doc 'll be here . Pete usually shows up if he 's got an appointment . " There was silence in the room as the young men and Watkins contemplated the karma of chronic lateness . It brought temporalpower to a spiritual universe . Pete Positano , the Sacramento Valley mystic , was at least as much the son of Shiva as anybody in the East Bay . Give him that.  |p103The  Sacramento Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Elaine , had n't shown up but offered an explanation . It just did n't want to happen . Pete promised to organize his anima for their next meeting and get the show on the road , since caring men can truly help each other . Shiva and Elaine do n't qualify . Watkins wondered if he was becoming a fanatic . Finding a woman to spend the years with him was not the answer to worldwide inflation , depression , unemployment , terrorism , depletionof resources , overpopulation , the threat of nuclear accident , totalitarian regimentation in half the world and weary drifting in the other half . True , he was n't capable of singlehandedlysolving all these matters , but surely he was capable individually of doing his best . During these mature years , had he suddenly stopped doing his best ? Was he turning selfish ? What if the answer was n't really an answer ? And did n't he know this already ? So in addition to all else , was the greed for love something that not only did not work but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to his other problems , the office required some care , even to coast along ; a friend 's will to be probated ; the dentist to be visited ; his quarterly income tax payment to be filed and paid ; also bills , after the checks were written by his secretary , Yorda , and signed by him ; the fridge to be defrosted ( a mess on the kitchen floor , which the cleaning lady , Dolores , would wipe up ) ; letters to his grown daughter in New Orleans , mild paternal ones  --  no telephone calls now becausehe did n't trust himself to sound mild and paternal ; ap104friendly note to his former wife , amicably rejecting her suggestion that he help her out in a difficult moment with her new lover , just temporarily pressed a little  --  his even pulse rate and blood pressure while replying to her merited a celebration but he did n't bother and not bothering merited a little celebration , too ; tune-up on his Saab , a car which was built for rough wear in Sweden but got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads unless someone was crying , and then it was generally self-pitying salt ; his colleagues to placate , although they seemed willing to let him play Menopausal Statesman , at least for a time  --  he would not go so far , so lazy , to have them gossip about whether early retirement could come at his age ; a stress test , the best exercise of the year , which ended with his doctor saying he had " the heart of a much younger man , " and Watkins said that fellow certainly had a busy heart , because all his friends seemed to use the same one , and the doctor chuckled ; his stockbroker to tell to hold , do n't buy or sell , I 'm making no decisions right now ; his dentist to tell him the X rays showed no new cavities , they stop at a certain age , then it 's gums , periodontal , that 's the problem ; the newspaper to be dumped in the garbage with its rubber band intact around it , the news not even unrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtime browse , piled up by the lamp .. . So was he a fanatic about something which the normal healthy seventeen-year-old begins to find himself too mature to bother with ? Both the Sacramento Bee and Newsweek brought the usual kind of news to Watkins  --  what he did n't want . Victor Lonkin , a classmate at Stanford Law School , had been appointed to the State Supreme Court and died , like a pope , within a few days of taking his oath . Watkins regretted he had delayed writing his note of congratulations to good old Victor . The note had n't arrived before Vic 's death because Watkins had not mailed it . But then remembered he had made a joke about stress tests , and hoping Victor did well on the treadmill , so perhaps it was just as well . He dreamt about Vic that night  --  a funny clever graceful boyp105who learned without sweat and spent a lot of time in a wet suit at Monterey , digging for abalone . Watkins had a snapshot of the two of them , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding snorkels up in a toasting gesture . That was before it was illegal to pry abalone off the rocks with tire irons in Monterey Bay . They had slapped the rubbery flesh till it went silly , and then fried it on the beach , with a driftwood fire flashingand spitting dampness underneath , and drunk red wine , white wine , and from each other 's dreams ; the white foam of water margin glowing in the starry dark , and they hugged the girls , they hugged each other ; and then they went back to adjoiningrooms in the Tortilla Fisherman 's Motel with the girls they later married .... Watkins felt an itch behind the eyes about Vic . It proved he could dream about something more than himself . He would have preferred not to have this proof . At breakfast , wide awake , he felt saddened  --  in addition to depressed and sorry , which normally should have been enough . He was a bonny lad with leathered forty-four-year-old Californiaskin . He was an adolescent with fine marks on his stress test  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen Vic except at bar association meetings . Yet he missed , oh he missed his old friend from McAbee Beach at Cannery Row , where they had eaten abalone , their own , beaten it till it relaxed and then cooked it near a wharfside hotel while the girls drank white wine and wondered when the boys would make their move . . . Poor Vic ! He decided to telephone the next woman on Bethany 's list , Marjorie Atworth , as he remembered Victor , briefly a state Supreme Court justice . He saw him in a snapshot one of the future wives had gotten off . Vic was clowning around with his snorkel , pretending to suck it like a boy sucking his thumb ... Watkins was telephoning , he was wondering if Marjorie Atworth might be the sort of woman who could put something in a pan , put butter in with it , make something sizzle and brown , giving off that nice sizzling , browning smell , fish or potatoes or onions , some good quick old tasty things like that . Swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtaken by anotherp106of his fat one-eyed engorged self staring her in the mouth as she smiled and decided to take it . Because oral sex was a more likely hope these days than the offer of a delicious pickup meal in the kitchen . Because dinner in the kitchen was a dream of jokes , ease and comfort , but the other was what he could more likely , as a practical matter , expect if all went well .. . Later he might write a note to Vic 's wife . When Vic proposed , had he thought to ask , Will you be my widow ? And he would contribute a small sum to Neighborhood Legal Assistance in Sacramento in Vic 's name . Later he would do both of these things , and also throw away the rubber-banded tubes of last week 's newspapers . Opening one of them had been his mistake . All about Vic on the front page and a photo in his robes , not his wet suit . Her phone was ringing . She lived in Dixon , Area Code 916 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long a commute . " Marjorie Atworth , " he said , " this is Watkins . From the advertisement . Your nice letter . I 'm getting back to you . " How shy they both were mumble mumble . How strange this is but what an adventure mumble mumble . How they might as well just mumble mumble . He drove to Dixon . One of the better things , he thought , looking for Scrim Street , intersection of Rice Avenue , is the lack of resonance in these meetings  --  it was also one of the worse things . ( Then why was his heart thumping ? ) The lack of danger and the danger , the indifference and the need , the distress and the stunned curiosity were part of it , too . The path of true love crossed many means of transportation . The town , with its well-kept ramshackle houses , nicely painted , dogs roaming , dogs growling and huffing on the backs of pickup trucks , had the look of a child 's version of New England . The houses just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , a fix-it granddad spending his retirement years joining a railway car to the original barn . As he drove up , sharp/eyed Watkins saw a mouse in the street . In Dixon , nice Dixon , it would n't be a rat . The air was sunny and warm . Gnarled fruit trees dropped plums on chickens which grew fierce on a diet of prunes and snails . Neighbors shared eggs and traded breads , occasionally a prune pie . Much might be wrong in the world , but paperboys delivered on time , and kids walked to school , and families lived near the grandparents . But even here , in Dixon , a young woman named Marjorie had taken pen in hand and been selected by Bethany . There 's Scrim . Now turn left . A cul de sac ending in a dirt turnaround . Her directions were clear . No , the thumping in his chest did n't mean he was in love with someone he had n't met . It only meant he was a bit apprehensive , a tiny amount of bleakness lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and the air were as clear as good directions . He sat a moment behind the wheel . He rejected the teenage temptation to comb his hair . Carefully he closed the door , not slamming it . Good solid Swedish economy door clunk . She would have heard ; she knew the time had come ; surely her heart , too , was foolishly jumping . The act of will that had gotten him near the top of his class at Stanford Law , along with Vic Lonkin , now brought breath deep into his lungs . What a victory , not to pant like a dog ! Watkins moving from triumph to triumph . He tinkled the bell on the gate as he strolled so calmly toward her front door , which was ajar to catch the sunlight  --  a long laser burst of glare on a worn carpet with a figured design . " Hi yourself , " she said before he had spoken a word . " Thank you . " " I have n't done anything yet  --  Watkins ? Is that really your name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thanks again , " he said . Marjorie Atworth had an inexperienced California face and experienced buttocks , it seemed , when he took a first look at her ; clean blond young face and slow deliberate walking motions.  |p108But  then he took another and the eyebrows were too thin and dark for her hair . Her behind was thin and narrow . She had an experienced face , a jaded face , but an innocent , virginal , kindly , spinsterish ass . No , that was n't the full story , either . Oh , it 's hard to get to know a woman in first-meeting safari snapshots . He suspended judgment . That would be the prudent man 's thing to do . At times Watkins liked to emulate a prudent man . " I never did a thing like this before , " she said . " I mean the use of media to facilitate such a personal , uh . " " Neither did I , " he said . " Have you ever ? . . . " she asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement ? " " No , of course not . Would anybody in his right mind ? Do you take me for that sort ? " " Nuh-no , " she said thoughtfully , trying to be a judge of people who were not rapists , ax murderers , sneak thieves or failed husbands and lovers . He believed he was evading a bona fide lie . Surely none of the women he had thus far seen had become a true friend . Consideringthat he had advertised for love and was just now chatting with a woman who had answered his advertisement , both their denials that they would do such a thing showed advanced possibilitiesfor the leap of faith . In this , human beings were different from whales and dolphins . " I had a longtime lover , " he said . " A woman , of course . She let me down . " " We 'll do that sometimes , " Marjorie Atworth murmured . " As Freud asked , what on earth do we ever want ? " She winked conspiratorially . " I also had a longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate wink , a separate conspiracy . " And she also let me down . " " Oh , " said Watkins . " I thought that ought to be upfront , " she said . " Does it distressyou ? Have you ever , oh my ? with a bisexual ? before ? " " I 'm sorry , no , " he said , " to the best of my knowledge during the past seven years . " He invoked the Statute of Limitations.  |p109She  smiled without winking this time . The broad fair face seemed winsome and inexperienced . " I believe you 'll find me quite feminine . That 's how I am with men . If I did n't see myself as a lover of the wrong sex sometimes , why would I bother ? With so many options , it means I make a real choice to be a man 's woman when that 's what I choose , Wats . " He winced . " Watkins , " he said , " or Wat . Otherwise it 's like kilowatts . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy around the house . Plugs , small repairs , even sewing  --  the femme side of Marge . Once we lay out my past , how I might , could sometimes trip away to a butch with a sunburned neck and that American smell of diesel on her collar , we are both free to choose . As far as you 're concerned , I 'm just the girl who married your dear old dad . I 've turned over a new page . I 'm playing the other loop . Hi there , Voltkins . " " You 're telling me , supposing you and I . . . you 're telling me you might suddenly decide no , so now you need a woman ? " " I 'm not telling you that , not at all . I 'm only telling you that 's what I 've done in the past . " " But you have n't changed everything in your character , have you ? " " Not necessarily . But I have n't not changed everything , ei-ther . " The lawyer in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfectly clear . She believed in both honesty and clarity , and if possible , those two qualities brought together again , as in the old days . " I 've not altered my druthers , yet I 'm sure I can live in the moment , Mr. Voltkins . I 've presented myself as I am and as I hope to be . If that 's not enough  --  " " Oh , it 's enough . " The prune trees dropped prunes , the chickens pecked at prunes and snails ; the neighbor grannies traded breads ; the sleepy town of Dixon dreamed on , safe from the university confusions of nearby Davis , the political and urban riot of nearby Sacramento . Marjorie was proud to embody , in her ownp110person , the small-town virtue of frankness about her bisexuality . " So having laid my cards on the table , I want you to know , Volt , at this very moment I absolutely do not have a vision of some muscular , strong , insightful , slightly matronly young toughie , what I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive , so divine . Instead , I 'm focused entirely on you . I 'm not thinking of a sun-smelling tractor mechanic named Peg . I 'm thinking of a tweedy small-town attorney-atlawcalled . . . Are you sure it 's not just a nom de fuck ? Really Watkins ? " " Really Watkins . " " Today , you 're my tough but gentle , " she said . " You 're lithe for a man of your age . You 're graceful in your walk , a true dancer . You smell sweet with some sort of soap I ca n't quite "  --  sniff , another sniff  --  " identify . " The air was clear and silvery in there , like a closet full of knives . Reassuringly she took his arm and matched his step to hers while she gave him a little tour of her house , chattering encouragingly . She had given up cigarets ; the cigarets she had given up were Tareytons , if he wanted some ; now she chewed but she never smoked ; she . . . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry , he was safe in her house , even if not a soul in the whole wide world had a clue about where he was and she could bury him in the backyard with the chickens , snails and prune pits with nobody the wiser . Well , perhaps Bethany would come looking for him in a few weeks . Nice lady . Considerate about a fellow 's doubts . Timidity was not a moral flaw any more than baldness would be . " Look , my skylight , " she said . " A gift from my ex-husband , inadvertent . Income tax refund we shared . Honor to him for sharing . I energy-saved with thermopane , plus got this cathedral ceiling . " Watkins craned his neck . The light was warm and amber , cathedral , but the thermopane itself was peppered with dead flies , fried in some previous sun and drying there . There were edges of rust on the industrial prefab windows . Think of it asp111oxidation , he decided , natural , organic , mineral . " You 've found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , Watson . Else your style finds you . This is a small town , but I 've traveled . Also I subscribe to magazines . " He paused and waited . She refused to do all the work . He had to contribute , too . " Skylights are great , I truly like them , " he said , and he truly did . " The sky out here especially , always changing . " " We 're not unique , Volt . " She bobbed her head rapidly with appreciation of his taking part in the conversation . " Other skies are not fixed , either . In Paris for example , or in Palm Beach , they are ever-changing . Boy , are you nervous . " There was a glint in her eye . Was she onto herself , not only him ? He began to fight back . " You 're pretty naughty , " he said . " Matronly toughies ! I 'll bet you 're putting me on . " " Maybe I 'm only mischievous . I do have this desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this about me , though women do n't so much . Mr. Lawyer , you misunderstand me perfectly . " " I do what ? " " It 's a pity . Because I want the same soft sweet cozy help in getting through the night you want , sir . Shall we continue the tour ? Be gallant . Take my arm again . " Her house in Dixon , which she at least once called her pad , was larger than it seemed . It was furnished in Huckleberry Farouk style , a grandeur of hanging macrame ropes , low gleamy couches , lace and gilt and paper Tiffany lampshades , one of which had shredded from age and heat . In a cozy corner she used a post-World War II red nylon panty to filter the bulb with ii nnatural glow . A Zodiac poster . A Grateful Dead poster . A low table , paisley pillows and slim throw-pillows in various spots in case of an emergency languor of the limbs . On the low iable , luncheon meats , cheeses and chocolates in a blue glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And an actual Freach brandy ( Remy Martin**** ) bottle , recycled with peach liqueur . " I 've a lot of Oriental in me , " she said . " I 've been to India . I 've trekked in the Nepal . I discovered my Eastern side . That 's whatp112I 've found . These are my collectibles . Some , of course  --  flea markets . " " They 're more than an investment , " Watkins said , " they 're a way of life . " " You said it , I did n't . No one else but us is to know what happens or occurs in this maison  --  a word I heard in Katmandu . Would you like a bath ? " " Or a shower ? " He was getting an overdose of tubs . She made a face . " In the East , bathing is a ritual , a ceremony , it 's almost mystic or religious , not just some hurry-up scrubbing-awayof the day 's accumulations . " She had thought ahead . The tub was already filled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor to absorb any wet from between the toes after the ritual , the ceremony . She was slipping out of her caftan and warning him to step up into the tub , since it was already on legs  --  fox paws , by the look of them  --  and the Detroit industrialdesignpeople who make modern tubs had spoiled people into stepping down . Undressed , her lower regions had a more maturelook than her bland , bright , blond expanse of face . There was darkness below . " Do you mind joining me for a bath ? " she inquired . " Pardon ? Do I mind ? " " Do n't offend , Watkins . That 's not what I 'm saying . For ordinarysocial interaction you 're okay . But if we happen to begin a little foreplay and it seems destined ... " She paused shyly . She too was timid . She blushed . " It seems destined to go in the direction of ying and yang , do you mind being squeaky clean ? " " Not at all , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sighed . She stood there , lifting first one foot , then the other , getting used to the thermal extremes . " We do n't have to predict , " she said . " We do n't have to make preconditions . But on this one matter , I like to make it perfectly clear . The smells of men , you know , I 'm not so used to them . The tight musky reek of crotch . The excretory ... " " I understand , " he said hastily . " You 're a poet with words . "  | " And I 'll scrub myself good too , " she said . " What 's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose . " Should she really have been placed among the top five ? Watkinswondered . Had Bethany made an error of ranking ? Was there something in Bethany that sought to play tricks on him ? Or to make it clear that true love was not all that simple a matter ? The sound he heard , as his mind raced toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bathtub heaving over onto the floor . It happened because they were both loweringthemselves into the hot water . They both thought Ahhh . Watkins did not ask to play with her rubber boat . No jokes . Meditation was the ticket . They sat and let the heat do its consolingwork . He did n't touch her , not with his hands . His waves touched her waves . He smiled and she smiled . He believed she was beginning to approve of him . Splish , splash , they were taking a bath . She sniffed steam up her narrow nostrils . Perhaps soon they could take bars of soap and wash each other in the crevices that sometimes offend . But since he hardly knew the young woman with whom he was bathing , and he was her guest , he would wait to be served . Vic Lonkin would have made faster moves . She exhaled . Her sinuses were in order . She said Ahhh aloud . She reached for the soap dish . When she handed him the bar of soap ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the hard soap beginning to wet down . With only soap between them , she had another confession to make . " It is a terrible , terrible thing , " she said , " to be smarter than the one you love . I hope not to be in , that fix with you . " " I 'm only a moderate achiever , " Watkins said , " but I have a high IQ ' She put on a trickle of fresh water . Maybe she liked splashing sounds . " And besides , I 'm not in love with you , am I ? " she asked . " So I do n't see any further obstacles . "  | " The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked . " It was n't a good day for Jeremiah when he announced this opinion . Better Watkins should look on a brighter side , such as what does that desperately mean ? That he and Jeremiah were trying to be calmly virtuous ? Pete Positano had views on the subject . His career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motto he had developed as a young counseling genius : Physician , you can only get others straight if you get yourself straight . The same for lawyers . He had a little take on Watkins , too . It was never a jury trial with Pete  --  prophets cut right through the red tape . Overhead , the rice-colored clouds floated listlessly across the delta , ready to dump dryness on the flat valley . Pronged metal irrigation twigs sprayed water on the fields from deep wells and from the brackish Sacramento River ; no one was deceived by clouds anymore . The puffs of grayness in the sky bluffed and hovered and turned sullied from overuse . The sun was constant these days  --  a worn yellow veil of haze . Watkins thought maybeis heart really was deceitful ... . I le had never fooled Bethany . It was one of the good and bad things about her . She was on to him . He supposed it was a thing in his favor , in his own eyes and in the eyes of God , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also inconvenient , hut he had learned in his life with wives that convenient women were n't necessarily the best . They did n't necessarily work out . Bethany interested him and delighted him , and she even likedp116him personally . And was inconvenient because she was n't polite about his secrets . Even now , she seemed to know where he was , at least when she wanted to know where he was , and he was just sitting at his desk at home , knocking paper clips about in a little magnetic box  --  a poor substitute for Latin music , staring at the white plaster of the twin condominium town house next door ( poor substitute for the mountains of Nepal , the church of Saint-Germain-desPres ) , watching the unmoving branch at his window , which after all was a nice miniature world , budding , leaf covered , with a green eraser tip of life where it touched the glass , when the telephone rang and he had no doubt about who it would be . He let a whole discreet Bell Telephone interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand reached out against his will . It knew and he knew . " How are you , Wat ? " Of course , often the telephone rang and he was sure it was Bethany and it was not . " Wat , are you there ? " But this time he forgot all the times he was wrong . " Wat ? Hey ? Answer please , Wat . " " I thought you were n't going to call . I 'm glad you 're not perfect . " " You mean I ca n't stick to my resolutions ? I can . But I miss you , Wat . " " When can we meet ? " " No , no , I just miss you . This is just a little blip . I ca n't see you , Wat , because if I see you  --  " " Why not ? " " I might want to see you again . And if I see you again , there we are . " Her voice was low , although surely there was no one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sweating body , his anxious sweating hand , he could ' imagine her curled up on her knees on the couch , whispering and murmuring and laughing into the phone . " So I just want to know if you 're okay and anything else you might want to tell me. "  | " I miss you , Beth . " " That 's true , that 's true . We do n't need to tell each other that , Wat . Anything else ? " His dream of love was to tell the truth and not to play tricks , games , strategies , tactics . What Bethany was asking was about Adela Jenkins , Aviva , Ms. Atworth , Linda King and whoever else might be filling his time . But Wat would offer nothing , he would make her ask directly ; and when she asked , he would think how to evade the answer . " I 've been running a little more . Lost a few pounds . Some flab you might have noticed  --  " " I never noticed , Wat . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the faculty senate . I told Frank not to get me involved . Adjunct prof does n't have to take a position . My friend Vic Lonkin  --  " " Who ? " " An old friend of mine . I guess I did n't tell you about him ... " She was curled up on the couch for sure , she was giggling for sure . " We hardly had time to reminisce about old friends from the least , Wat . It was the nature of our . . . " Her voice trailed off . She was n't giggling after all . " Our afternoons together . Our time together . Our ... " t was hard to talk on the phone with her . She was n't giving ww av at all . She was just talking on the phone . He could n't nee nt ion Vic without causing a justifiable impatience in her . Vic was n't relevant here . Vic did n't die to be used by Watkins to soften the heart of a woman . ' Fell me about Mr. Lonkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to law school together . We used to go prying abaloneoff rocks . We studied for the bar together . " " ' You 've been seeing him again lately , two bachelors on the town ?  --  " No , " he said . " Beth , what are you doing with yourself ? " " You mean have I found someone else to be a Wat for me ? No ,  |p118dear  . You 're special , Wat . It was special , Wat . I guess I want to tell you that . This is the time before carpool when I think about you every single day . " " I really . . . like you , Beth  --  " " I do n't know why . I do n't know why you like me . I do n't know why I think about you every single day . It 's stupid , Wat . Do n't tell me what you 're doing about those women . I do n't care . I only care for what I 'm losing , not what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sensible and a good mother and a loving wife and , if I can , a grown-up  --  " " Bethany ? Beth ? Beth ? " She had hung up . He knew enough not to call back . It would be too hard for her to try to say more . It would be too hard on him . He imagined her way of saying , as she sometimes used to , These are only selfish tears . You have no right to feel sorry for me . These are only tears for myself . It was what she always said ; as , for example , last year , when the family went away for the summer . " These are selfish tears because I miss you . These are only selfish tears for myself , poor poor little dumb Bethany . When we have fun and laugh and feel good , because that 's what it 's about with us , Wat , then it 's for both of us . So do n't let me dump these moods I sometimes have , not on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fat ugly dumb selfish tears , that 's not your business , Wat . " Okay , what could Pete Positano do for him ? Along the line of keeping busy and solving the problem of being alive when some good people were not and the woman who might redeem the facts of life for Watkins , or at least endorse them properly , was busy with things that mattered more to her . Things which , in fact , were rather more important , once a person granted that Watkins was not the most important element in the world or even in Bethany 's world . Pete thriving in the helping trade , what did Watkins want of him ? Sexual help ? There was so much of that . It was a drug on the market . How to be " better " with women friends , men friends ? Oh no , not more American government . Not morep119improvementism . How to live with failed marriage and love ? How to live with kiddies far away and busy with their own growing up ? When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more disposable income ? Pete liked full disclosure . That was the deal with Pete , plus straightforward honest male grief about the catastrophes and tragedies , all gathered together about the camp fire . Let 's see now . Bethany needs to simplify her sunny days ; his married Bethany wo n't meet him afternoons , after tennis , sometimes even instead of tennis , anymore . That 's pretty dim in the tragic dilemma line . It was n't even totally pathetic , except he felt it so . Did he love his grown , moved-away daughter and son ? Yes . They looked good to him . Sometimes they met on national holidaysor when the Bar Association had a meeting in the East . Did he quarrel with his former wives ? Not very much . No . The one he might quarrel with if he could find her , he could n't find . And he was n't looking for her . And he would n't even quarrel with her . He was comfortable with her running away from him without quarreling with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the news . Afterward , true , he remembered their friendship like a series of postcards unfolding  --  McAbee Beach in wet suits , sweating the liar Review course together on Golden Gate Avenue , smoking meerschaum pipes like genuine grown-up country lawyers , the first attempts at married palship , four people who did n't match anymore . They went their different ways . Vic was a friend from days gone by . A lot of beer had foamed under the bridge . Still , an erratic echo in his heart , a beat of the wrong octane in the machinery , different in degree but maybe not in kind from what stopped Vic 's reciprocal recollections of old what's-his-name , the guy who settled in Davis , Watkins  --  that pang was a preview Of ' coming myocardial attractions for Wat , too . Pure self-indulgence and please say good-bye to that . Still , poor Vic ; good-bye to sympathetic knockings in the chest and good-bye to Vic . So was he comfortable ? No . Bethany 's plan was symmetrical and sensible . She scat/tered loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of them as loose desires . All he had to do was bend a little , and he was willing to bend . Bend and pick them up . It was n't as easy as all that . Striking a blow for balance on his own , it seemed he was looking for a guide , a community , a leader of men , a sharing and an instruction . He was looking for a philosopher and a creature of nature to help him stay alive in this unraveling portion of the century . That 's how the times and himself felt to him  --  needy , distracted and unraveling . Watkins , the man who had everything . " Have I got a men 's group for you , " Pete Positano said , and shifted gears . Everything in his mouth and throat altered . It was not a question . " Come on in . Do . You 're welcome . Please do come to our group , Watkins . " Dr. Positano 's , Pete 's , the voice of the man troubled Watkins . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . He was on campus and they had met was all . When he was married to Elaine , they had dinner together a few times . The wives did n't pursue the acquaintanceship , and then the wives disappeared and nobody pursued the matter . The voice , talking over the phone , maybe it was his professional voice . All at once there was a slightly prissy offshore accent , as if he had studied English from a pirate radio station specializing in antique Donovan and classic Beatles and a lot of Destroy and Shark and Dead Kennedy punk . But that was n't Pete 's South Bronx in-person voice . And in person the head was strong , bald , with a long fringe of brown hair and tufts in the ears . Over the telephone he sounded as if he had a shock of white hair he kept tossing out of the way of his forehead . The voice was breathy . The voice had met Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis during some previous incarnation . It did n't breathe all the way down . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little whine in there someplace . The making-an-appointment voice might be different from the actually talking-together voice . " Would you have a cup of coffee with me ? " Watkins asked . Hep121hated the querulous in his own plea . " Let 's just meet on campus at the Coffee House . Maybe just a few minutes . Just to check on each other , it 's been a while  --  " Chuckly , confident , in-charge Pete . " You 're really in trouble , that it , Wat ? Been a long long time no see no hear no touch . Sure , I can give you a moment of my valuable hanging-out time . " Was n't it kind of Pete . They sat under an aluminum umbrella outside the Student Union . Their voices racketed off metal . The sun had disappeared behind the building . A group of Chinese students at the table nearby was working little calculators ; no , it was Rubik 's Cube . They were learning to hang out , too . Pete was so happy with what duty bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your problem , my friend , is what we used to call anomie , we got better words now , which you do n't need , all the head trips you take yourself on anyway . Let 's zap you with the classic diagnosis : anomie . Anorexia nervosa of the spirit . Wat , you are skinny in your soul . " " Nice to be slim someplace , Pete . " " See ? Jokes and headtrips when I try to offer you a frank , fraternal and brotherly brief diagnosis free of any charge . I try and I succeed , but what good is it ? What I do n't understand , further , is what gives you the right to disdain , if I may use such language , campus chicks ? Snobbery ? Are you that religious ? Do n't you have tenure ? Are you so choked with principle "  --  the prophet boomed triumphantly  --  " you can afford to be an arrogantheadtripping mindfucking loser ? " " I ca n't answer all that yes or no , " Watkins said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ androgyny when it was still called bisexual . Are you too arrogant ? Do n't tell me it 's a matter of taste , Watkins . " " It 's a matter of taste , Pete . " " Headtripper . Mindfucker . I 'm only tentativing out a little diagnosis , a probe . " They fell silent together . Thanks would be superogatory ; silencewas better . Two old acquaintances perhaps doomed , in middle age , to become friends or enemies , through no fault of their own , drinking coffee in the late afternoon while the restp122of the campus made love , studied for exams , solved Rubik 's Cube . The flat gray rice-colored clouds would wait until tomorrow . They would n't rain tomorrow , either . Watkins continued to be troubled by the voice of Pete Positano . That soft purr after the South Bronx success snarl . Well , everybody works out a manner . Pete , who clawed his way around campus as tiger with tenure and official med school firebrand , had the right to play Jacqueline on the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Pete 's style was not the problem . They agreed about the objective problem , the one outside themselves . It was how to deal with what the world wanted men to be ( men in trouble living up to it ) and what women wanted men to be ( what do they want men to be ? ) and what men would like for themselves ( unfearful , unmiserable , even brave and happy if such is possible ) and what Watkins thought he wanted ( to be the lover of Bethany or another woman who could make him not love Bethany ) . Without giving her name , Watkins mentionedhow those afternoons after tennis  --  the bath together , the murmuring and cuddling  --  had saved his life from itself . No names , please . That silo visible on the rise of the hill beyond the flatness of campus , it was as far away as the smell of grain and fertilizer when the wind blew across the fields , and the night burning of the rice wastes , and the bluffing clouds that brought no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He was evading the subject . ) The subject : Maybe if he were a proper man instead of a middle-aged boy , an old child , a viable presenile codger , then he could tell why he was still looking for another woman to give him the comfort he did n't get from his previous women , who were mostly forgotten , or his wives , about whom he cared little now , or from Bethany , for whom he longed beyond good reason . No explanation . ( The burnt rice and silo were replaced in his head by the recollection of light-limbed Bethany wrapped about him , heavier-limbed hairy Wat wrapped about Bethany ; her smells of clean , light , exercised , fanatic-about-exercise bones  --  fizziness of Bethany  --  this was no explanation , either. )  |p123Why  not learn to be a man instead of this needful lover ? Oh my . He had enough trouble getting to be forty-four years old as a boy . The shelves of HumanHouse were filled with books about unleashing , unlocking , dechaining , how to become more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Male Machine . The Liberated Male Personality . Beyond Male Masculinity . Saying You 're Sorry and Male . All those apologies and resolutions seemed to be for others , even if they happened to be aimed straight at abject Watkins . He understood there was a problem and that 's why he was dealing here with Pete Positano and his fellow men . Could n't deal anymore with Victor Lonkin . Watkins in pursuit of help and the truth . Watkins not giving up . They met in a carpeted encounter room with fat pillows in HumanHouse across the California frontier as the sun was going down over Interstate 8o and Western civilization . Troubledmen , uneasy men , fretful men , men in disarray is what they were  --  that sort of men . Modern Man . Watkins wondered when Pete Positano would show up and if this lateness were some sort of traditional dating drama he was putting out . But then Pete showed up , and Watkins wondered if his anticipation of Pete 's tardiness was some sort of complaining drama he was emitting . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be with each other in truth , love and self-help . In fact , where were they ? " Where I 'm at , " said Pete Positano from his land of shared pain , " is I want approval , I do n't want any more negativity shit , I want to be accepted for me . " . " Uh-huh , uh-huh , " breathed Rod , the convening host from HutnanHouse , a Universal Unitarian Humanist minister who had gone into the helping field because he craved something more nitty-gritty . " I 'm not exactly ordained anymore , Pete , but I accept you . That 's a start . Now , gentlemen , as your facilitator , let us proceed . " Shoes off , toes wriggling . Two or three half-lotuses , the rest Trawling . Watkins was the only one with black lawyer socks stretching up the calves ; well , he was the only lawyer . Evidentlyp124Pete felt harassed inside , where reality began , and felt like taking the initiative : " I do n't want any mindfucking psychobabblershere . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you ca n't stand my power , stand away . Power  --  " he frequently made a two-finger quotation-mark gesture around the strong noun or verb as his words flowed on ; at present there was none of his whispery Jacqueline Bouvier telephone voice ; he underscored an aria against mindfucking with a mighty repertoryof gestures and intonations which called for the raising of the voice . "  --  my power , it 's too hot for some people . I turn up the burner . If it 's too hot for you here , a bunch of academic types except for Watkins and he 's just an academic lawyer , do n't ask me not to be Me , Myself and I , Pete Positano from the South Bronx who got his Ph.D. , if it 's too hot for you , move away from the stove .... " Rod , the helping professional , opened a window onto himself . " I seem to need to be professional about everything . I 'd like not to be so obsessive-convulsive . Gormay chef , cabinet-maker , humanist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I had to be tops , but now I 've got two kids , a boy eight , a girl five , I really love that boy eight and that girl five is so sweet , I do n't like things to go wrong . My wife , uh , I guess I still have a wife , but I 'll fill you in later ... " Now it was Pete Positano 's turn to say , " Uh-huh , uh-huh . " Chuck , a bearded scientist , asked : " Is there some reason we 're not telling our last names ? " " Let 's stick to what 's relevant , " Rod remarked briskly . " Is your father 's name relevant ? What about your mother 's ? " The scientist nodded . " I do n't have male friends to dialogue with , that 's how ignorant I am . It was my lab all the way . Since I came out here to California , got taken on by the lab out here , research grant , I realize there 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , there 's fun , I want some of that , plus there 's , oh  --  " " Getting into yourself ? " Pete asked . " Just a probe . " " Something like that . Maybe some good sex , if it involves honesty on both sides . I do n't have a formula . " Chuck didn'tp125want to finish . Watkins felt the witness might have said more if Pete had not supplied an answer . " I hate competing , " said Fred from Poly Sci . " Sometimes I find myself breaking pencils and hyperventilating , I need to express myself so much , but then when it 's my turn I ca n't speak . Pete , you have a lot of power , just like you say you do , but you tend to interrupt a person 's thoughts and then  --  " " Oh , man , " said Pete . " I hear you . I want you to truck right on down with me . I can give you a lot of comfort from my own distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The group was looking at Watkins . Their centered eye boiled into him . Pete 's eye demanded the confession of failure , the only road to honesty and sharing , Watkins wanted company . He was here , was n't he ? He said , " I have wives and memories of wives and grown children moved away and a woman I love and other women  --  " He was n't going to tell about Bethany 's advertisetnent . Honesty was okay , but not handing them the knife and showing his belly . He was willing to share the private , but not the secret . " Some of my relationships , " he mumbled , " are in varying degrees of disarray . " " Oh , man , " said Fred . " Pete ? " Chuck and Rod also looked to Pete for a response . " Man , I hear you talkin ' , " said Pete . " We 're with you , are n't we , all ? Watkins , we are with you all the way . We 're on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what this group can do , it can give each other support , it can give love , it can give . . . " He tilted Iris head , commanding his followers . What comes after love in t he giving department ? " It can give love , not that poopydoo , that Tit we have to take from the world . Man , just like Watkins , I 'm angry , I 'm mad , I 'm plain pissed  --  " Watkins wanted to raise his hand to say he was n't angry , he was n't mad , but teacher would n't call on him.  --  I 've got to express my power they 're all stopping me front . " Pete tugged at his earring . " That Blue Cross Plan don'tork for me . They keep shooting my bills back at me , plus the doctors do n't know shit from penicillin -- 1 'm in a position to tell . Just shows how the machinery has gone nutsy , my friends.  |p126Is  n't that what 's on your mind , Watkins ? " Pete was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to live in groups , darting about like a pilot fish . Watkins decided calmness might resist Pete 's power  --  he thought of it as fever , hysteria , powerlessness . The communicants offered their bad news about wives , children , onrushing age , sex , work , miscellaneous night distress . Pete kept saying , " I hear you , I hear you , " in a rush to get to the important things on his mind . He nailed the decade and Americaas an Ageist time and a Sexist Society ; no one disputed him . Like Watkins , they were preoccupied with men and women being together . Maybe they were better than he was . They also worried about ambition , competitiveness , compulsions , about health , money , jobs and Achilles ' tendons . At first they did n't talk about the love of any individual women . But of course Watkins did n't , either . " I want to be understood , " said Rod . " I understand , so why ca n't I be understood ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a lot of shit . That 's what I 'll call it . Man , you got a right to be mad . I 'm mad . I 'm getting into violence , man . That 's getting to be my new thing . " Watkins worried that Pete might , with force and violence , rip off his earring . At the same time he was learning something about himself , and about himself with this old friend Pete Positano , who was rapidly becoming a mere acquaintance  --  that a certain kind of competitive , talkative , deeply resentful man was . . . a menace ? No , a difficulty for him . Was this because he was competing with Pete in the mindfuckinggame ? ( Pete 's word . ) No , Watkins decided , willingly answering his own question . I dislike Pete because he 's dislikable . He 's trying to be one on whom nothing is lost . He is one who finds nothing but his own need . For Watkins , this also seemed to be a warning . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did not need to like his old colleague , Pete Positano , the group as a whole was learning something else . They had superior activities . Watkins wanted to join . Sounding-off was fun . It wasp127pleasant to exchange remarks , a sort of energetic loafing . Confidencesand doubts , consolations and angers , without the help of a screw-top bottle of Chablis , this was advanced behavior for advanced thinkers about themselves . Complaints . Confessions . Phrases . Something like basic training was taking place . Even the new recruit , Watkins , felt a warmth in the chest which he identified as the beginnings of comradeship . The news about Vic Lonkin had rocked him a little . Chuck , the bearded engineer , thirty-three  --  the age when Christ was crucified , Watkins noted unaloud  --  and married eleven years , two children , separated for a time from his wife  --  during this time he had his first affair  --  was now happily , he announced resentfully , back with his wife . They had a few problems , that was all . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uh , herself . He was grunting like a wrestler . In fact , he was wrestling . This time Pete did not interrupt . All the fellows waited . Chuck said in a low voice : " Hard to open up sometimes . " Uh . Uh . " I 'm not an Eyetalian , a Jew . I 'm used to being , uh , too careful . In my group we call it dignity , cool . My group makes a lot of trouble for itself is why I 'm in this group . " " Go on , go on , " said a bunch of Jews , Italians , Undignifieds . " Get down to it . " Chuck was gasping and flipping his hands in his lap . " Well , my wife . She . Well . She wants to initiate sex . " Oh , boy , what whoops of pleasure and congratulations . ( shuck looked blond and bewildered . A fringe of working blond heard . Watkins and Pete did not believe Chuck had told the - whole story , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? It 's great if you finish dinner , maybe a take-out pizza , maybe somebody even cooked tonight , and the kids are tucked in , the boy eight and the girl five ( but that was Rod , not Chuck ) , and now Chuck and Mrs. Chuck are sitting in front of the teevee , and now her soft hand goes creeping up your thigh . Oh , buy . Well , no . Chuck was the only man not enjoying this . What was wrong ? " Well , she wants control over her own body . Well ,  |p128she  wants the decision about sex to be hers . Well , that macho male thing pisses her off . " Well , what 's wrong ? " Well . " " So she 's initiating sex , is n't she ? " Pete asked . " Well , no . She wants control , she . She wants to initiate it , she . But she never does . Well "  --  he was stammering  --  " what she reallywants is to initiate nonsex , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No goddamn fucking at all ! " Whew . But it was n't a total surprise to Watkins or , he suspected , to Pete . Chuck , this sweet muscular young blond engineer , with a wrestler 's compact bulges , also had a purple , congestive heartfailureface . " She 's mad at me . She wo n't . If I try , she 's dry . She 's mad and stays mad for a week . I think that 's when she 's happy . Nothing ! " Pete Positano studied him . That face of Chuck might have been called blushing , but it looked more like congestive heart failure , and Pete squinted against the pain . At first Watkins thought Pete would stroke , make nice . Instead , he grinned and said , " Does she let you grab yourself ? " ( Pete seized his own crotch . He was n't pretending . He did a South Bronx hustle of his balls . ) " Does she let you play with yourself ? " ( Pete rubbed his hand over the fresh bulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jack off ? " " I suppose so , " said Chuck . " I do n't ask her . " " Well then , " Pete said with a purr and a hum , " well , then she 's pretty good to you , is n't she , Chuck ? She only wants to control her own body , right ? " " Yes  --  " " No . She runs yours too . " Everyone waited . Rod lifted his hands to his ears . Chuck lowered his eyes . " Well , " he said , " if I had an affairnow that we 're back together , that would hurt her too much . " Oh God . The fellows sneered . None of this was UniversalUnitarian Humanist fellowship . Because Chuck 's wife was madp129at Chuck , she declared no sex for her and none for Chuck ; those were the rules . Even Rod showed a momentary nonfacilitating aversion to Chuck by holding his nose between two fingers . The little gesture came back to him from when he was eleven years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chuck said . " She 's my best friend . Does marriage have to include . . . I mean , after eleven years and the kids five and eight ? ... " " Me too , " said Rod . " If you feel like it , " Pete asked , " why not have those noonsies , those mad bad afternoons on the floor of your office with the graduate student ? " Chuck shook his head . " I could n't do that . " " But if it 's not important ? " " I could n't do that . " Everyone  --  Rod , Pete , Fred , Watkins  --  was yelling and laughing and pushing at him now , but oddly enough , despite the sudden noise and disorder in the room , instead of keeling over with a burst of anxiety-clogged capillaries , some kind of moral sneeze cleared Chuck 's plumbing . He looked into each shining furious face . The stream was gushing with freshets of comradeship . He was interested and touched by logic and illogic , and defending himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I only brought it up because it was n't settled in my mind , " Chuck said . They heard . They waited . Watkins said , " Why not just have that affair but not hurt her ? Do n't tell her about it . Pretend you 're a Frenchman . " Fred said , " You could have it with a man . " " Wuh ? " Chuck asked . " Well , me . It 's only a probe . " This sort of thing had not yet come up . They were about to quit for the day , and here Fred was throwing this monkey suggestion at them . " Me , sometimes I get bored with my wife , the kids , they get on my nerves , so what I like to do once in a while , maybe the Christmas letdown or around I lalloween , is "  --  well , he would n't stop now  --  " is a littlep130male scene . Just for relaxation . For a new option when the going gets rough . " Rod stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk nod , stretched , started to put his shoes back on . As he laced , he looked up winningly , facilitatingly , and asked , " Next Wednessametime , same place ? " Watkins was slow with his shoes . He was trying to lace up his thoughts . Yes , male friends , he liked these fellows and some of his colleagues , he was charmed by intelligence , cleverness or even good looks . He was n't jealous of them . Vic Lonkin and he used to camp overnight on the beach in Monterey . So was Fred just being more available to the world ? Was Watkins 's pursuit of understanding from a woman just a way to avoid what Fred was more open about ? Is Open what it was about ? Is that why he suffered such choosiness , such a stupid refusal to accept anyonebut the tennis-playing wife of a dentist ? Watkins finished his shoes . He was sure he liked women more than men 's rooms . Nevertheless , he brooded on the implications of Fred 's solution to the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to be united with how things might improve in a better world . Stubbornly Fred continued . He had the courage of a mild and thoughtful hero . " When you come right down to it , to the basic meaning of things , " he was saying softly , shyly , " I mean when you analyse it in depth , Chuck , you 're really kind of a gorgeous hunk. "  |p131The  kinds of help Watkins was seeking added up to trying to tell him something . He was crawling toward the edge of brink . He stood on all fours on the green growing tip of decay . Contradictionwas his crystal-clear method to resolve his lack of clarity . Even his grinding students at the School of Law were surer of spirit . Damnit , he was distraught . It occurred to Watkins almost every day that what he was doing might not be the way to climb back to safety . The reminder did not put any caution into his behavior . Go back ! was not useful advice to the man who was already careening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win something ; he was being crowned with a dunce cap . When he taught his classes , and lectured about precedent , about how morality led to rules and procedures , and thus to the rights of even the wicked , he was thinking about running his hands on Bethany 's thighs or dying , like Vic Lonkin . His eyes dimmed , his students took notes , he almost said , And when she comes , she Jiggles . Instead he said , " Even the guilty deserve the best defense t hey can be given . Generally , of course , they do n't get it . " His mistake might have begun with putting so much need on her slim unwilling shoulders . His mistake might have come from confusing pleasure with peace and justice . His mistake started long before he knew Bethany . She was a symptom , what she had planned for him was a further symptom , and what was happening to him as he shambledabout the state of California was an elaboration of both of . their symptoms . Distractions were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true life.  |p132Now  that he had all that clear , which woman on Bethany 's list should come next ? He studied the sheet on which she had typed names , addresses , box numbers , telephone numbers , zip codes , area codes , brief notations of personality and references to filed complete letters . In the main , their character was : Available . His own character was different , but also available . The hunter was only following orders . Then all by himself one day , with no preparation from Bethany , while peacefully engaged in getting a refill of his **25;9483;TOOLONG and questioning the very basis of his existence , Watkins happened to meet a woman he liked . She was a meter maid giving him a ticket for overparking in the little stretch of redwood downtown which had recently installed meters  --  abig-city refinement . He dashed under the stained redwoodoverhang , past the country mural and the beer-cool swingingdoor of Punk in the Night , and said , " I 'm here , I 'm here ! " " I 'm writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingperson polyester . She had a wide short plump body . Her three-wheeled vehicle was humming . Her face , heavy in the jaw , was dappled with some sort of fleshy excess . She was amused by the smartly dressed lawyer franticallyprotesting his five-dollar ticket . Why did they all do that ? " I was here , " he said . " I ca n't stop writing , " she said , " and you know I ca n't tear up the ticket . " " But I called to you  --  " " But you 're a lawyer  --  are n't you Mr. Watkins , sir ?  --  you know once I 've started writing ... " Impasse . He stared . " You can just mail in the check . You lose a morning by going to court , " she said . " You know I 'm not going to do that . " " Mr. Watkins , I should n't respond to your shame and anxiety , but I 'm human too and I 'd like you to have a nice day . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression , but I 'd like to learn to handle corruption and generosity . " " Wonderful , " he said . " How much ? "  | " I still have to write the ticket . It 's free of any charge . So what I 'll do is here I 'll change the one to a seven on your license plate , well , to make sure , also the five to an eight , see ? And now the computer ca n't pick up whose car it really was  --  " " Thank you ... " " Only following orders . I 've got to write the ticket . When I do my graduate training I 'll have to figure out how to adjust to not following the regs . " He started to reach into his pocket . " You 're not going to offer me anything , " she said , pouting . " I have to chide you for attempted bribery . So far I 'm into generosity , I have n't started corruption yet . " " No , no , no , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for my card . If you ever need anything  --  a divorce , a will probated , maybe a little murder defense ... " " I know , " she said . " I 'm amenable to all the passions , Mr. Watkins . Perhaps some evening when I 'm free and you 're free and we feel like it because we 're both free , and you have a six-pack , or I have a six-pack , we can sit in my kitchen , Mr. Watkins , just person to person , and shoot the shit . I do n't use the hard stuff . In LifeSpring , for instance , we even try to get over the lesser addictions , such as nail-biting . The hard stuff  --  vodka , gin , heroin , excuses every one of them  --  interferes with the conduct of my professional duties . " Watkins was remembering the silly moments with Bethany and driving toward the public courts where she played tennis at this hour . He should not be doing that . He should be doing something else . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gaily decorated VW with Cinzano traced on its doors for a payment of fifty dollars a year . Students got their coke money the oddest ways . Some cleaned apartments , some managed condo complexes , some stenciled their wheels with tricolored bottles . The high price of coke was also stimulating individual initiative ( Watkins felt sorry for addicts and wondered if he was a certain kind of one ) . Some worked in cancer labs , forcing monkeys to smoke . Some installed wood-burning stoves and solar-collecting greenhouses.  |p134Some  were adjunct professors of law , a useful job within the system , but gave their strength to inappropriate notions of justice . Felt they were entitled to love . Sometimes Bethany had made him play games . " Let 's play Kansas City , " she would say . He used to do that for her . " I 'm from Kansas City , Missouri , " she said , " and I make up jokes . Would you like to hear one ? " " Okay , " he said . " Okay . I take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , Missouri , and a Kansas City , Kansas ? " " I do n't know . " " Because Missouri loves company . Would you like to hear another ? " " No . " " I take that as a go-ahead . There are a lot of Chinese folks in Kansas City , Missouri , named Wong . If they have a child , what do they name it ? " She waited . " White , " she said . " Because two Wongs make a White . " When she tired of these games , and of being unafraid of her big bad high-IQlover , her favorite lawyer , she found a game of her own . She had chosen Watkins to play her game and he was doing so . But probably she had n't planned for him to park among the trees as he was doing now , and sneaking about to watch her in her regular-as-clockwork thrice-weekly tennis workout . Three times a week on the Davis public courts . She still wore whites  --  old-fashioned woman . From a distance she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference that , up close , the sunlines and laughter lines and slightly hardened lines were slicing up the skin around her eyes and mouth . Or yes , it did make a difference . He loved her more for her determination and experience . If she did n't know she was suffering , that was merely a semantic problem . Watkins believed the body knew . Parked in the shade , he watched her game . She was matched against a short , intense , skilled player , Marvin Ellis , a lobbyist in Sacramento for the rice growers . He returned everything shep135sent his way . He was stubborn and careful . She bent and touched her knees before she served . She wrinkled her nose . She slammed her serve at Ellis , she chortled with laughter , she grunted a little on a strong forehand . From his car he could n't hear her grunts . But he knew that gesture around the mouth and eyes , and those grunting rutting sounds . He wanted her . He could n't have her anymore . While she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaps into the air to keep warm and moving , lubricated . He started the motor and drove away . He slammed the wheel with his fists . Now what good did that do ? No one was watching to approve of his passion . Bethany was as concentrated as a monk on her tennis religion . His fantasy of informing her husband : but Watkins was civilized , he was not a brute , and that would only retroactively demolish everything between them . The lady was inventive . The best solution was to do as she said . In such cases a negotiated settlement leading to submission was in order . He drove and he did n't stop thinking about Bethany . He made a solemn vow to stop as soon as he got to his office . By the time he reached for his briefcase . By the time he finished parkingthe Saab . By the time he locked the door . Although he was tallish , heavyish , but running twice a week , middle-ageish , lawyerish and accustomed to estimated tax forms and contractual provisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie felt like a lad , a boy-in-waiting , a page in gusts of carnal expenditure . She had been waiting for him , it seemed , through several years of her marriage . Love was sometimes as light and quick as tennis , and sometimes a lot of brawling and thrashing . They were animals in deep grass ; the arms and legs flew their own needful ways  --  highly untechnical , Watkins thought . That was even better . Bethany blared when she came , if she did n't giggle like a girl . If she was pretending , it was still a mighty energetic noise . She could n't be pretending . Not that honking . No woman would . Afterward he felt tired , warm and easy , and awash with con/tentment . He asked her if she felt okay . " I 'd like , " she said . " What ? " She was asleep . He thought it was the most wonderful momentwithout consequences in his whole life . There may have been consequential moments which were just as fine , but he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tilting its head at them through the window . It might try a tentative peck at the glass and then again it might not . It was a robin with what seemed to him a white breast . Perhaps the red had been bleached out of his vision by the brawling and thrashing he had just undergone . The tilt of the bird 's head reminded him of a youngster bored on the telephone . But Watkins was not bored . The bird was . It departedin a flick of feathers . " Your breast is so white , " he said aloud , and the lady smiled in her sleep . Sometimes inadvertent communication was the best . She slept for twenty minutes . At home , hamburgers to broil for her kiddies ; her eyes fell open , clear , not needing to be wiped ; she dressed ; she was gone ... . He stopped remembering her when he parked his car , just as he promised himself , just as his solemn vow stated . It was an oral contract which had not been spoken aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoning her at home ? She would have showered by this time after her tennis with Marvin Ellis ; hamburger-patty time . " Hello ? " He did n't know what to say . " Hello ? " Could he say it was Watkins , the crank caller ? Gently he put down the telephone . He wished to apologize to her . There was no way to do so . She would be shrugging and not too disturbed . After tennis or love she felt at ease with her body , ready to handle craziness . She would be making the salad for her loved ones . She would be dusting the hamburger patties with spices . She might even , in the miracle inconsequence of such things , be idly wondering how her old friend Watkins wasp137doing in his investigation of the women out there who longed for the love of a sensitive , lonely , healthy prof. mn . He would not think about her . He left her imaginary body in her imaginary kitchen , and only allowed himself one more question : Would she be resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oversized amber horn-rimmed glasses that made her look vulnerable , so young , easy to hurt , as she was not . Her kitchen and her body were real to him . Only Watkins was imaginary.  |p139Chuck  's battle with his wife went on , charted in the Male Peace Room at HumanHouse , although as far as she was concerned the war was over and she had won . Someday , perhaps , she would " initiate "  --  her word for leading the way to sex . Someday , perhaps , she would forgive . Someday , justice would be done in the universe , and more important , injustice would be repaired by oblivion . The group helped Chuck in his chosen fate , which was to wait and wait for kindness . Fred 's confession hung from the conversation like cobwebs . Okay , so he enjoyed a lad now and then . These were postcontemporarytimes and such was man 's endeavor in his confusion . It had been shocking to some , but was n't that part of the deal ? Now it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the helping field . It put him at the mercy of smoothing the way for others . Since people who suffered seem to develop strong smells , it was not always easy . Uh-huh , uh-huh , said the others . " If I 'm boring and it gives you someone to look down on , that might help , " Rod said . " On the other hand , that might be your problem if I 'm boring . Think about it . " Pete thought about it and Watkins thought about it . Pete said , " I 'm into power , as I 've said . I 'm a vital person . I 'm aware of my problems , but I 'm too strong for this goddamn world . The bastardswo n't get me , because also I know how to bend , I know how to yield , and then I know how to come back with my teeth bloody . " " Whom ? ... " Watkins asked . Pete was just getting warmed up . I le was racing his motor . Murderous statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the track . " Whom , " Watkins asked , " were you biting with your bloody teeth when you were yielding ? " " You , mindfucker , " said Pete , " you 've done nothing but lie to us . You think this is a liar 's game ? " There was some truth in Pete 's jab . Watkins decided to throw him off balance by a quick dodge in the form of a surrender . " I 've got some sadness in me . Probably a lot . I 'm willing to talk about what 's past because it does n't matter anymore . My parentsmaybe . My wives . " " Your kids . " " Even that . Though it matters . Though they 're grown up and they got their own things now . " " So what the mindfuck are you doing with yourself , Wat ? " " You 've got some ideas , Pete . I 'm not ready to say . " " Then I 'll say , " Pete announced . Watkins looked away indifferently . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weary and blank Chuck . Watkinslooked weary and blank himself as Pete blabbed excitedly , confessing on behalf of his friend : " Watkins went to see a woman he met by mail ! Someone who advertised for him ! He answered her advertisement in the Reader 's Digest or something ! He actually could n't find someone for himself and so this mindfuckerwho comes on so strong here with being calm and snotty and everything , this lawyer with his lousy marriages which did n't succeed , I happen to know he got himself a mail-order fuck ! This mindfucker ! " Watkins was amazed at how wrong a man with an alert listeningface could be . A man whose profession was sympathy , understanding , empathy and insight could achieve such rotten witness . Watkins was amazed and not at all perturbed , as detachedas if he lay on a battlefield and the shells were whistling and he was already dead . " Pete , " he said , " you nailed me . I confess . I avow . How could you retain so much ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pete said . " You said you 're a man of power , Pete . You 're a man of hysteria , is what I see . Sort of womanish even . "  | " And sexist besides . He thinks hysteria is feminine ! Not only he ca n't live with my power because I 'm Italian and loud and came up by my own bootstraps , but a goddamn macho male chauvinist , in addition , too  --  " Rod loved it . This was breakthrough . Watkins had broken out in a faint sweat , a nice feeling , like after the first seven or eight minutes of a run . It smelled good to him . He felt ready to move and lightened . He did n't mind that it was n't the sweat of running but of mental strife . It was combat , not anxiety . Evidently he was ready for the fray . " Pete , you want to be anchorman of this little network , do n't you ? " " No , laddy , anchorman of the whole poopydoo world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it straight . " " Ah , " said Rod , coughing , " ah , Pete , I feel this should stay with the valid personally meaningful , if you 'll allow me  --  " " All is allowed , Rod . " But Pete seemed to accept the rebuke and sank down into his aura . He was gathering his power around him . Back to Chuck and Mrs. Chuck . Fred looked hurt . People seemed to have forgotten about his bisexuality . No one was caring . What was the point of coming out ? Chuck also felt discouraged . He had a problem which was real . Did these others think theirs were more real ? Was n't it obvious they did , and was n't it obvious they were wrong  --  his was the most real ? Watkins cast his vote for Chuck . What could be realer than Mrs. Chuck ? But Watkins seemed to be the only one who was willing to pass the torch of suffering to another . He credited Chuck with Chuck 's misery . Was this interest in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expression was getting on Watkins 's nerves . " I wish you 'd stretch your vocabulary , Pete , " he said . No violence ! " Rod warned as Pete half rose from his halflotusposition. " 11it the pillows if you have to . Scream and smack the pillows . " Pete murmured Ortunnun briefly , like a small boy playingp142with his toy truck , then closed his eyes , his half-lotus the envy of the masses ; he invited peace into his soul ; then he said , " I pass . " " Thank you , thank you , " said Rod . " We 're learning and we 're getting to be much better friends . But do we pay sufficient attention to each other ? Anybody remember Fred came out of the closet a few mere minutes ago it seems ? Anybody care to remember I said last time there was a measles epidemic raging in my personal family ? What about Fred and me ? " " Calamine lotion , " said Fred . " That 's for chicken pox . Measles is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles . But thank you for your contribution , Fred . And now I have a question for you : Is it anyone at all you happen to meet in the men 's room when this thing comes on , Fred , or is it someone special , or something special about a certain someone ? " " I 'm a chicken hawk , " Fred said . " Sir ? " Rod was puzzled by vocabulary other than his own . Perhaps he was thinking of a virus , a pox . He sought to probe more deeply . " Fred ? You said ? " " Chicken hawk . Rice queens such as Chinese boys . Dinge queens such as black boys . I like kids , real young ones . Chickens . When I 'm in that mood , I 'm a hawk , I pounce , " he said bitterly , eyes downcast , eyelashes fluttering . " That 's when I 'm a man of power , too . " No one wanted him to cry . " Nonsense , " said Chuck . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepwalking ? " " Only when I 'm sloshed to the gills , " Fred said , " and my wife has to wipe me up and put me to bed . But I remember everything . Especially what I wanted . " He added shyly , " That 's where sometimes I 'm ahead of you fellas . " Everyone wished Fred did n't make it so complicated for them . In his shy way he leaned on them . Pete said , " You 're open , I 'll say that . You tell what 's in your mind , heart and pants . You 're not like Watkins here , the mindfucker , who does n't wantp143to talk about his mail-order brides  --  probably poor Korean girls or farm runaways . " Rod was pulling his toes through his socks and making them crack . " So how does everybody feel today ? " he asked . " Is everybodyall right ? I feel kind of peaceful and relaxed , except I wrote to General Motors to tell them how I feel about their cars , domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck perked up . He knew about production problems and American assembly lines , the competition from Japanese engineering , even if his know-how stopped at his wife . He had participated in a statistical study of how many automobiles put together on Friday tend to have errors in them ; about the same as on Monday . And the Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday U.S. cars were n't so good , either . Sunday they made no mistakes , but they made no cars . " Personnel is going down , " he said . " Pride in workmanship . Even Canada . " " And your wife is n't , " Pete cried , cackling , " she is n't going down . " Watkins gazed at Chuck . He was trying to remember the marriage in which Chuck dwelled , and to fit the sober former wrestler 's body into the problem of the sober former wrestler 's distraught mind and fretful soul . Is sex essential to a happy marriage ? Is good engineering design sufficient to make good cars ? Chuck wanted to be told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe ? It had to be one of them . Or maybe it did n't . Tell Chuck . He wanted his wife to be right , but he wanted to be right , too . He wanted his history to be cleaned up . General Motors could n't do it all by itself . He wanted to be comforted in his distress and they were n't doing it . " Empty heart is like an empty life , " Watkins said . " The Stones , " said Chuck , surprising him by knowing thewords . " I'he song dated from that time long , long ago when MickJagger was young , not yet skeletal , hammering at the eminenceof t he Beatles , and Chuck and his wife used to grab at each otherin a car at the Sputnik Drivein in Washington , Iowa , and gaspingand coming with sticky fingers and they loved each other.  |p144So  he remembered that song . Long long ago , when a full heart was a full life , long high-school years ago . " Yeah , " Watkins said . Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children already ? And you 're here ? " Doing a child 's work , he meant . " Yes , pal . " Chuck squirmed and wriggled ; his plump thighs strained the seams of his pants . So needful of love  --  being called pal by a middle-aged man made him blush . A nice letter from a GM vice-president could make him warm all over . The pleasure and pain of clashing emotions , the pleasures of pain , reminded Watkinsof something . What was it ? Oh , of course  --  appetite . Not the need for food , more complex and mysterious than that . The appetite stirred by an upward rounded head with straight fair hair hanging and flying in the excitement of talk . Bethany laughing and pulling her knees up in bed and saying , " Ooosh , it 's warm , I 'm so prickly , look at those freckles . " It was not the dream of pleasure which flooded Watkins 's body as he looked at Chuck . It was the reality . It was desire for a specific living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasp a cloud in his arms . Everyone was watching at him . Had he said something ? Even Pete was silent , eyes wide and expectant . This group of boys was filled with desire ; lust fueled the sarcasms , groans , laughs , whispers , shouts . Shadows of bicycles passed outside the drawn curtainsof the windows of HumanHouse . The reflection of a bird or a Frisbee dove down the glass . No wonder Watkins felt light and hungry afterward as he headed out across campus , and had indulgent and friendly feelingseven for Pete Positano , and cozy warm ones for the other sufferers . He was n't ready for work ; not ready , either , to write to another box number . " Chuck ? " he asked . " You want a coffee ? " " Sure thing , " said Chuck , whose wife never asked him to sit a while over a cup of coffee . And as if continuing a conversationp145in the Engineer 's Club : " Chrysler 's no better . Ford is losing it . Toyota and Datsun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever do class-action suits , Watkins ? I mean , a bunch of consumerswho got a lemon get together ? ... " Watkins was on a coffee date with a nervous , talkative young person . They sat in the student coop , amid all that delicious flesh , and Chuck was babbling about design defects , production defects , as if Watkins had n't heard that his wife never put her product on the line . A girl in a gray velveteen running suit kept glancing over her French grammar textbook at Chuck , not Watkins . She liked hunks . Chuck did n't notice , and anyway , he was n't involved in French grammar . That was n't his field ; he did n't care about Renault , Citroen or Peugeot . Watkins could learn to love French grammar ; but of course he was too old for her , and that 's a decisive accident of destiny.  |p147Most  of the women who reply to your box , Sir , must be freelance hookers . I am not . I am a blackjack dealer at Caesars Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my living . If I wanted to be a hooker , I 'd hook , but instead I came here from Cambridge , Mass. , to burn out my sinuses and find the money and time to do what I really want to do  --  translate the poetry of Tristan Corbiere , who was a hunchback who died before he reached my age ( I 'm not old ) , and also to run on the desert . It 's one of the few fashionable things I do you might name it so-called jogging . The desert is lovely in the very early morning . I am able to do these things , yet I am not happy . Content , yes ; happy , no . So therefore if you wish to take a chance on a **28;9510;TOOLONG blackjack dealer , I can get you a deal at the hotel and you can look at me at my table ( Station 8 ) and no harm done if you just move on to the slots or the hookers and never even say hello ... . Her- name was Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackjack in the Nevada desert . He imagined a skinnied-down , melancholic young woman with a falsely superiorsmile playing at the corners of her mouth . He could put up with that . He was interested . He got a deal on the flight . True to her word  --  cool ironic regretful voice on the phone  --  she arranged a High Roller 's Discount for him at the hotel . She sounded so greatly regretful that he said , " Look , I 'd like to see the new electronic slots , anyway . She laughed shyly , charmingly.  | " You have no obligations at all , " he said . " We 'll just have a meal at some odd hour . " She laughed again and said all the hours were odd in Las Vegas , and wanted to keep him on the phone a while . " Let 's chat then , " he said . " My nickel . " " You understand me , " she said . " I 'm worried about this whole thing . " " That 's the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it a creep ? Is it a crazy ? " " I do n't know about you , " she said , " but I have some doubts about me . " " Well , are you psychotic ? " he inquired . She considered the matter while they both heard dim cheerful voices from long-distances calls bound to them on the circuit . " I think the short answer is : not psychotic . " " There are  --  " he began , but she was n't finished . She wanted to be fair . " If you 're quick , you can hide a lot . If you 're troubled , as I am , you have reason to hide everything . " " Thank you for that , " he said . " I appreciate . I started to say there are slow insults in all our lives . For one thing  --  attrition . " She listened in silence . He liked the fact she was paying attention , and hoped she would do that in person . " That 's not quite what I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not making this trip into the desert to have a discussion . Are you ? " " Whatever 's right , " he said . " I 'll follow the leads I get . " Her laughter was nice and antedated the attrition she had suffered . It might be important to let her know he too was terrified about what he was doing , they were doing , but he was going to go ahead and he hoped she would too because if a person did n't go ahead he or she died a little . The way to say this by telephone did not come to him . He had the time and the money , but he did n't have what it required . It was n't just a matter of sorting out the pronoun references . He was quite confident the way to say this in person might very well not come to him , either . Sometimes the gesture of a hand and the look of an eye helped , sometimes the heartbeat , sometimes even the willp149to be kind helped . Sometimes nothing helped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even over the long-distance wire , and also feeling his own , he made a best effort . " I ca n't be any weirder than what you meet there , " he said . " I meet nobody if I do n't choose to meet him or them . But if you pass by Station Eight and want to leave a message , maybe we could "  --  her laughter was very shy and nervous  --  " we could have the special steak-and-eggs breakfast , served between eleven P.M. and seven A.M. " " That gives us a lot of time selection on the special , " he said . " I 'm a big spender . We can have it any time . " The night before he flew Frontier to Las Vegas , insomnia knocked inside him like the wrong gas in a motor  --  snarlingly protesting what was going on . It could be about Linda King . He knew it was about Bethany . Perhaps he did n't know . Morning came and an airline ticket flapped in his hand . A commercial on his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short flight . The Electrojet bucked in a desert cloudstorm , befitting a western airplane . How do you spell Relief ? the voice asked with rhythm , resonance and confidence . The answerwould come very soon now . With the weight of another , he thought . That 's how you spell Relief , not Rolaids . This city of Las Vegas was about planning to be a winner ; as dangerous as planning to fall in love , all hope and dream and actual loss . People kept coming back for more . Was he planning to fall in love ? No sir , just here for the fun of it , your Honor . Genius may be the art of taking pains  --  being a lover required taking not too many pains . This is worse than tennis , Bethany . He wished he could sleep better alone . In the lap of the airport the electronic slots blinked with their compressed radium glow . He blinked back in a swelling desert heat which struck him in the face like a magic pain wand . His cab was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop sounding at the entrance from speakers hidden in cement sea/shells . " Welcome to Caesars Palace , Thy Pleasure Dome ! Thy show in thy Showroom tonight is Cher , her Revue , her Band and her Charm . Thou must enjoy thy stay or discuss with thy assistant manager . Welcometo Caesars Palace , Thy Pleasure Dome ! Thy show in thy Showroom tonight ... " He checked in and reported to thy desk clerk that he did n't need a porter . A man in a shiny black suit of the sort worn by Frank Sinatra 's non-show-business friends circa 196o stood watching at the desk clerk 's side as he registered . His room was in Thy Swimming Pool Access Section . A guide past the acres of slot machines , row on row , might have been helpful . He found the room , touched flocking on the walls thick enough to break a fall , lifted a hand to the air conditioning , abandoned his clothes , ran barefoot to the pool . Ah , nice . He swam and quieted the jangle within and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , tanning only his feet , and listened to the gossip of two pretty young ladies with two hefty older men who kept answering telephone pages . " I met one of those photographers , pepperzinis , you know , chase a person to Dieseldorf or wherever you 're going if you 're famous , get the shot . The guy I 'm with this time is n't in the celebrity business , hopefully . He 's a big real estate mongol  --  complexes . " " Builds them or sells them ? " " Hopefully both . For senior-type citizens . No kids , all the pets your heart 's desire . He 's a famous biggie in that line . And there are more senior-type citizens every day . It 's a growing field . " " Has he got the time of day for you ? " " Hopefully . He says he wants to rest in the warm , mature but not fat like his ex  --  in the arms of a twenty-two-year-old who really understands him . " " With me , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm twenty-six . " " You do n't look it . " " Neither do you . It 's choosing carefully , is n't it ? When I was in Beverly Hills this producer guy I was breaking up with , itp151was more a trip than a worthwhile experience , I went to this free-lance lesbian mystic , sort of holistic , and she said not to bother getting any older , nobody would appreciate it ... " Watkins dozed . His feet grew pink . He was comforted . He woke with a start and it was no more than ten minutes later . Linda 's letter had seemed a little stiff  --  uneasy  --  but he could understand that . He took a quick splash in the pool to chase away the shadows . He came out , stood in the shade and blotted himself with a towel . The two **27;9540;TOOLONG now exchanging their life 's stories in whispers , probably had come to the intimate stuff . A man nearby  --  narrow chested , in a flowered shirt , with a gray tan and a pinched face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we are at Caesars Palace , one of the top hotels . I never take her to the Best Western , and like Rodney Dangerfield says , my wife do n't give me no respeck . I should live so long . She would n't even come to the pool with me . " " I understand , I understand , " said Watkins , and dashed across the cement , hoping his wet feet would protect him from the radiating desert blaze . The man in the black suit , not looking hot at all , the one who had stood by the desk clerk when he registered , moved out of his way slowly so that he could enter the hotel . The moment of blocking him made his heels and toes burn . The man was wearing a black silk suit that needed a tie , not a gold chain . He was wearing a gold chain . Linda had given him her hours and her station , and he decided to follow her instructions . He would watch her dealing at blackjack for what that could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what he would be staying for . Let it happen , he thought , however it happens . It does n't happen when I work at it . Position G , Station 8 . She did n't know what time he would sow up . In any case , programmed to deal with snap the cards , watch and rake the cards and money , there could be no exchange of shy greetings on the floor  --  maybe not even a sign of heartbeator interest from her . The pit boss , if that 's what he was called , a brown and curly refugee from some war-torn Middlep152Eastern nation , viewed the action from his orbiting space satellitebehind the dealers . Dead pans were the smart facial attire on both sides of the tables . Linda King . Her face looked a bit greenish under the forevermidnightglow . Too much makeup . Perhaps that masklike greenishness was part of the modus operandi for women dealers ; no clocks and no time allowed on this flesh . Although trial work was n't Watkins 's chief interest here , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he guilty of having written to her ? He had only replied to her letter , which had replied to his advertisement , which Bethany had placed without his knowledge  --  he was framed ! He was innocent ! But then again , he would have to take the rap . Even a man struggling for a merciful verdict recognized that to pass the blame to Bethany  --  andtherefore to Linda-was the coward 's way . He was not sure he wanted justice . He just wanted to come out of this tunnel . Linda did n't recognize him yet . At her table a lonely young gambler , soft , plumply pretty , with cowboy boots , Indian shirt hanging loose over his jeans , gold chain with some sort of medallion  --  acrucifix , by God  --  bouncing on his chest hairs , sat brooding in front of his chips and cards . Linda was raking them away . Jesus had turned His back on the blackjack cowboy . As he watched , it suddenly occurred to Watkins that Bethany regretted what she had done  --  Bethany was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent and adventurous women  --  and with this junk thought to give him a quick rush , he approached Linda , muttering , as if in English and by phone , " Watkins here . Hello . What now ? " Through whited lips  --  well , the climate was dry  --  she said , " I 'll ring your room at midnight when I get off . A half hour after . I want a swim first , get the smoke and air conditioning out of my face . Now scoot , there 's no socializing across the table . " Kind of neutral , Watkins thought . As he pushed through the rows of clicking , swirling , tingling slots toward the wing of Thy Palace where his room lay , he was wondering if Linda King was a true American woman andp153would be twenty minutes late . Making a date at ten to 1:oo A.M. might change the rules . Or if she was really a miracle person who could swim , wash the distraction away , take care of her hair and hike to his wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a teal blue coat tapped him on the shoulder as he turned the key in his lock . " Sir ? " the teal blue person asked . A photograph was pinned to the badge on his lapel . " Sir ? " " Yes ? " Watkins had n't stolen any chips , picked a purse or left a drink unpaid for . " Sir , she says make that one o'clock . Thank you , sir . " Watkins lay down for a nap , gazing at Thy Ceiling . The man in the uniform jacket might have been a vice-president of CaesarsPalace ( well-tailored jacket ) or a Thy Bus Boy ( it was a uniform , after all , with security data ) . He dozed . It did n't matter . " May Thy Dreams Be of Gain Beyond Riches , " the tape had said . His dreams were not of those . Watkins dozed , but anxiety continued to knock inside him , protesting what was going on beneath the hood . He lay among the monuments , chapels , tombs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and it seemed his toes could sense the reverberations of the Circus Maximus show with Ann-Margret , or maybe it was the Cleopatra 's Barge Lounge , with Bruce Westcott , Continuous , 9:oo P.M. to 3:0o A.M. , or the action in Caesars Bar , where the B.S. Trio was Ultimo Tasty . Thy Glitz , Thy Funsies , Thy French Chicken-of-the-Sea Dining , Thy PinkieRings . Bethany had only meant to help . Convention City and slots and the pickup trucks and campers roving up and down the Strip , the drivers carrying paper bags around their bottles  --  what did she have in mind for him ? Or did she only want to free her conscience , off-loading Watkins , and did she think a fearsometriviality would do it ? Although sure he could n't sleep , he woke with a start at twenty after twelve . Probably Linda was making long sweeping breaststrokes across the pool . Ile was taking a shower . Linda was brushing smoke and chlorine out of her hair , since shep154did n't have time for wash and rinse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened the door and saw a man in boxer shorts putting a room-service tray out into the hall . In the hall , smell of dead cigarets and air conditioning . No footsteps clatteringtoward him . He sat under the lamp and read Thy Personal Guide to Caesars Palace and wished he had brought something else to read and remembered he had . He went to his bag . There were two shy light knocks at the door . " Hi . " She entered and seemed to glide around the room . She was not so tall as she looked behind her table of green baize . Her hair was wet from the pool . She wore white jeans , a filmy white Indian blouse over some sort of shiny silk ; she wore low-heeled sandals . She wore a little lacew Yrk of been-around , **29;9569;TOOLONG around her eyes and mouth . Smile lines , one could call them . He turned , watching her as she measured his room . " Nice place they gave you . " " Are n't they all basically the same ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rooms . " " I 'm not a gambler , " he said . " And I 'm visiting your room , " she said . " High roller , are n't you ? " He ducked his head winsomely . " So am I , but it 's between us . No house take on this deal . " She studied a scene of Montmartre which someone had copied from Utrillo . " Thine own Utrillo , " he said . She sat down abruptly , patted the chair nearby and said , " I 've got it . A terrific idea . Let 's agree , okay ? No sex . " " Uh . " " This has nothing to do with any inspection of you . You look clean and attractive . But obligation is making us crazy , Watkins , so if we just  --  " " How about , " he said , " to keep the romance going , why do n't we just say no obligation ? " " That 's better . I like your language . Just one further codicil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Signed and attested , " he said . She sighed and looked relieved . She said , " If you can afford it , order a bottle of champagne from room service . " He moved to the phone . " Are you hungry ? " " Not necessarily . " Champagne and little sandwiches , Thy Assortment . Later he too could shove a tray out into the hall . When strangers meet , powerfully mauled by expectations and events , they might either make love or tell their life 's stories . Of these two choices , they were now doing , alas , the more intimate thing . " I can see you like my looks , " she said . He nodded , I do . " Neat , tidy , clean and I move well . " He nodded . " But I do n't like to swim in the daytime . I do n't sun . I have this incision from a ruptured appendix . " She considered , then offered the truth . " A cesarean section . They can make it fine-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was crazy , no , distraught , but it 's like a spiderweb  --  " He did n't ask whose fingernails . He did n't ask where the baby was . " So I 'm like a tidy pretty woman who knows she 's ugly inside . I 'm a neat , clean , tidy one who knows , soon as a man looks at me , I 'm messy and . . . They call those scars that stick up proud flesh . ' " He heard himself uttering words which surprised him . " Let me see . " " Are you listening , sir ? " He shrugged . " That just came out . I 'd like to suggest I was just expressing sympathy in a peculiar way  --  " " To show you do n't mind . You sure it does n't turn you on ? " " I do n't think so . " " Off ?  --  " I ca n't judge in advance . " She began to unloosen the belt of her white jeans . And then she stopped and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one important matter with one less important submatter . We are huth embarrassed . It makes us kind of funny with each other . " " Not easy , " he said , liking her a little.  | " And ease is what we have been aiming for so long and not getting at all . " He liked her quite a lot . She rehooked her belt , showed him no proud flesh just now . He urged her to go on with her story , her turn first before his . He promised he would not find her unfeminine or whining or egocentric or anything else on the minus side of the universe , but very , very interesting . And his turn would come . So she said she had gone to college in Connecticut , but not a famous college , a branch of the state university . And since she was discouraged by the class , charm , wealth and confidence which surrounded her , and wanted some , she dropped out . Never mind the logic . And then since she was pretty , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery in New Haven . But that was dumb . A receptionist , and it was one of those tourist decorator galleries . You know , Indians in full headdress and cows flying around with violins . Real Schlock plus imitation schlock . But she got the idea of selling paintings . And this man suggested she advertise a few prints , a few oils as if she were a private party , sacrifice , must sell , personal reasons , and when the suckers came to her house explain they were an inheritance from her dear grandfather  --  wear black for the occasion  --  and just wanted them out . . . . Incidentally , by this time she was living with the owner of the grief-infected artworks . She despised Salvador Dali , melted or stiff , real or fake . Through him , she met a hotel executive from Las Vegas . When she got tired of being a private , low-overhead art dealer she accepted an invitation for a trip to a warm dry climate . That broke up rather quickly . " Not till after my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got my birthday present from him . " Her birthday present was the tuition to enroll in blackjack school . " It 's a mechanical thing . There are a few mechanical and moral aptitudes . The rules were n't beyond me . You need an IQ of one hundred ten , of which I have much better , and no prison record , of which I do n't have any . I cleared . I got this job at Caesars Palace . " She stopped.  | " That 's not really a life 's story you 're telling me , " Watkins remarked . " That 's a few selected scenes . It 's barely a short subjectdrawn from the basic life 's story . You 're holding back . " She smiled . " A Tall Tale and True , from Legendary Time Past . Think of me as Tinkerbell , Watkins . I sure am holding back  --  damn right . Wo n't you , also ? Okay , holding back , but no lies . Somewhere in there , not necessary to tell how or why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'm going to see her again Christmas , I think , maybe next summer . Her father kept her because he loved me so much . " " That must hurt . " " Revenge is sweet . Now about you , I 'd prefer if you do n't give me the gore and pain because I can guess it from here  --  your face , Watkins  --  without you saying anything . I can see it , man . It has to do with women , your mother , your wife "  --  he was shaking his head  --  " or some other women . " " All of the above . Of course you 're right . But since I obviouslyam not out of a job or paralyzed  --  " " You can be a philosopher about it . A scientist . You 're interested in your own love life , which does n't happen to be the case with everyone , Watkins . It 's rare at your age . " He felt his eyelids crinkle . It was n't fatigue . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air conditioning , or maybe just the late hour . " Grief has made you thoughtful , " she said , " but jeez , maybe it 's only thoughtful about love . " " Thank you . " " You 're a love pervert . " " These errors fill the world , " he said . " The cracks widen and that 's what it is , Watkins . " She was plainly delighted with her suitor , her gentleman come to call with conversation in Caesars Palace . " So after all that former disappointment , we say it 's not a bad life ! " she cried . " Are you unhappy ? I 'm not . I swear by all I hold dear  --  I 'm not ! Of course , I hold nothing dear anymore , Watkins . " He squirmed . He had always drawn the line at discussing happiness-unhappiness with strangers , and even , in fact , with friends . With Vic , he had talked some nights through , but thatp158was a long time ago , student days . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hotel room in Las Vegas at 2:00 A.M. with a new stranger , one of his best strangers . She surely had a man in Las Vegas , maybe someone right here in Caesars Palace , but she was n't telling because it was none of his business and if she wanted to tell him she would and , he decided , if it mattered at all , he would n't be invited to visit her , would he ? With an uneasy sense that logic did n't logically apply everywhere , he turned these thoughts away . There might be someone she did not hold dear . It was his turn . He mentioned his marriages  --  not bad , not good , although the divorces seemed mostly bad . He mentioned his law practice and hastened to add he was not a really rich lawyer , in case she thought she might have a birthday coming ; a prosperous small-town attorney , which is another matter . Since she came to Las Vegas from the East , she might not know that Davis  --  solar Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boom towns in California . He did n't want to seem a sugar- or even a natural-honey daddy . He mentioned that he carried no herpes , no high blood pressure , no outstanding physical defects  --  hobbies were running , tennis , swimming , Vivaldi , Bach , Couperin and a social conscience . " A typical California upper-middle person , " he said glumly . " Now I have no secrets from you . " Yet he did . He might have been able to tell her about prematureejaculation , if such had been the case ; about bankruptcy , disbarment , child-murdering , if such had been the cases . Such were not the cases . But he could not tell her the name Bethany . He could not say that Bethany had written the advertisement and picked his possible future loves for him . All he said was , " A disappointment . . . she would n't leave her husband . " " I wo n't ask you more , since it 's obviously a tender subject , " said Linda . Watkins worked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Patricia Ann , " he muttered , " was her name . " The heavens did not open up and strike him dead . The truth is not possible , he thought . It is not always even necessary.  |p159Linda  King 's gaze upon him seemed to waver a little . " This kind of conversation , " she said , " I mean talking about everything is what I mean  --  it 's tiring . It 's not negative , but is it really positive ? I wonder if it 's too much , too soon . " " Too much what ? " " Usually people just goof around and play and that 's so easy , Watkins . Courtship , you know  --  modern courtship . But this telling so much truth , little broken pieces of the truth , it 's worse than tiring . Are n't you exhausted ? " " I thought it was the desert , the traveling . " " It 's the tension , my dear Patricia Ann 's friend . Are you sure you do n't have active herpes and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'd know if I did , " he answered . " I take Vitamin C. " " So do I. With rose hips . The natural acerola . I 'm a nativebornhealth person . " She held up her hand to silence him . Just because she was talking nonsense , and they both knew it , was no reason to interrupt . " So are you native-born to health , I suppose . Look , have you been to Veronica Velveeta 's shop in the mall ? Get some natural vitamins , validate your ticket ? I need to sleep on things for a while , Watkins . It 's been a long day . Why do n't you get oriented ? And I 'll sleep and get myself oriented , would that be satisfactory ? " She smiled into his eyes and looked away . One of the things he had begun to like about her was how she looked into his eyes and smiled , and did not bite the smile off when she looked away , but continued to smile as if some mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that also worried him about her was how the smile continued , a vagueness , as if the person did not know he was no longer there . Well , he was there , but she was looking at the wall and she was still smiling . " I 'll go easy on you , " he said . " Yes , please do , " she said . She showed her nice even teeth , California teeth they even had in Nevada these days . " If I give you the chance . " It was confusing . He was hard to please , he knew . He had been punished and he was needful and suspicious . Somethingp160about her smile was reassuring and something was unsettling . Something was vague and something was almost as sharp as Bethany . Maybe it was just her sending him away for a while and he did n't want to go . At least she did n't test him on Tristan Corbiere . Night plus day , he thought , equals sunrise , and day plus night equals sunset . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town a little , " she said . " We 've gotten sort of acquainted , which is strenuous , so let 's rest now . " " It would be easy to rest together , " he said clumsily . Littleboywince pretended it was a joke . " So much sex comes from embarrassment , you know ? I mean , people ca n't think what to do or say next , so they  --  " " Do n't I know , " he said . " We 'll do it differently . Maybe no better , but since we 're doing everything differently from real human beings , why not this ? " " I 'm real ! " he said . " I 'm stupid but real ! " " And you 're nice , too . I mean it . If you were n't , maybe I 'd just fuck you good-bye and disappear , but do n't we both know about that ? I really do kind of like you , Watkins , " she remarked , and it was almost like a puff of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsation of Las Vegas middle-of-the-night glow . He continued his night 's sleep . When he woke , the day was blazing . He could visit Veronica Velveeta or put on his Saucony shoes and shorts and work out the craziness by running along the Strip . In this heat , this fierce oven , run ? That would be crazier than the craziness . In this heat , this oven , visit a Veronica Velveeta , a woman with a name like that whom he did n't even know ? But she ran a travel agency and he needed to postpone his departure by a day or two . She could endorse the ticket . So it was almost sensible . In the Desert Mall , down Las Vegas Boulevard from his hotel ( taxi , white-flecked lips on the driver , too-small tip for a short run ) , he found The Trips Agency , Veronica Velveeta , Manager . It was a long narrow room papered with posters depicting Maui ,  |p161Tahiti  , Acapulco and Nice , all featuring the same all-purpose native maiden , her breasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustached ladies answered phones and swung on their rotating chairs . It was not so much that they had mustaches , actual hair lying slickly in place , as that they were dark and heavily made up and their skin glistened and the shadows above their lips shone like cat 's whiskers in moonlight . They talked quickly and confidentially about rental cars , three-day weekends with double-occupancy , free tokens for slots and drinks and vouchers for lounge shows . A crew of hookers undergoingrecycling as telephone solicitors . Watkins did n't think too deeply on the subject . Which was Veronica ? From an inner office came Veronica Velveeta , also dark , slenderand rakishly mustachioed , greeting him in an accent of some borough of New York which was not Manhattan . Watkins was ready to contend that neither her maiden nor her married name was Velveeta . " Linda King sent me , " he explained , " and said I should ask particularly for you , about changing my reserva-tion  --  " " Any girl here can validate , " she remarked , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly ? " She beckoned him behind the counter . " Come into my office , Wat , the air conditioningis mellower . What she meant "  --  closing the door  --  " what Linda means is clear . And she might be right , but we ca n't be sure yet . " Why does this always seem to happen , Watkins the Lamb asked as he was being led into an abattoir of the Desert Mall , when you think you do n't want it to happen , and not happen when you think you want it to happen ? He was thinking these thoughts because the well-creamed dark lady of the upper lip was kindly making a sandwich of his light poplin pants between her two well-creamed bunlike hands . Impatiently , compassionately , she unzipped . Of course He could resist . It might have been proper to do so . But adrift as he was , and not so sure of himself as he used to be  --  and the nice smells of the velvety lady , and the yielding of the wide leatherlike couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , oh , oh , and it happened . She smiled at him . " No obligations , no quid pro quo asked or expected . Absolutely not any reciprocity intended . You do n't have to think you owe me anything , Watkins , that would spoil my trip . Just go down on me a little . " Why , he hardly knew her . She was only the friend of an acquaintance . But perhaps in Las Vegas you do n't need a long period of precunnilingus sharing and trust . He said : " What I 'd rather do , if you 're a runner , is we take a run together . " She perked up . " You said runner , not jogger . I like that . And the truth be told , Watkins , I 'd like that better myself . " " Thank you . " " A person can get oral sex any time , but try to find someone who 's into health and running in this town ! I mean , if they are , they 're also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts , a little terry halter , Nikes with those feminine little neckless socks . " Voila ! " she said . " Let 's do it . I 'm blushing already . I 've got the measles all over . Running really arouses me , Watkins , puts the gurr in me . " " I appreciate , but I 'd like to run with you  --  " She looked at him , aghast . " My God ! " she cried . " My God ! How inconsiderate of Veronica ! Why did n't I think of you , only what I wanted ? Dressed in resort wear , not running ! Oh , my apologies , I 'll drive you back to the Palace and you can get your gear . And we can talk . " What she liked about Las Vegas , she told him , chattering happily as she steered her air-conditioned Impala , is that it 's not the scene of the crime . That is , places where people are raised always seem to reproach people . You ca n't help being reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your marriage or marriages and all you and the other concerned parties did wrong . But in Vegas , well , it 's not home . It 's like living in Paris or Rome  --  she bet Watkins had never considered this  --  it 's like being an exile , you know , an escapee , you know , an an , an " An expatriate . " " That 's it ! An expate , and you 're fresh , you 're free , everything is how you want it , plus there is real money to be madep163in so many different ways  --  a dear close friend of mine invented a whole-grain honey-yogurt Shampoo of the Stars  --  " " I can see why you 're a friend of Linda 's , " he said . " We talk too much ? " " You 're both thinkers . " She smiled brilliantly  --  the mustache less gleamy in the bright sunlight  --  and said , " Plus doers . I probably wo n't tell her what we did , or more precisely what I did to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " he said . " Veronica wo n't tell her , " she said , " because Veronica probablydoes n't have to . She knows . She 's like a little psychic , too , where all the bodies are buried . " He did n't thank her for this information . " Are n't we women full of surprises for you men ? " Veronica asked . " That 's just because we 're unpredictable . " " I brought shoes and stuff . These days I have to take care of myself . " " Make that your personal choice , Watkins . You men are just as wild for me , too . I figured you for a golfer and cocktails , not a. runner  --  surprise !  --  even though there 's a nice hint of leanness around your jaw and thighs . " " Thank you , " he said once more . " You 'll have to stop saying that , " she advised him . " I 'll get conceited . But it 's just another of those Paris or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of natural Old World Europeancourtesy . It 's how we make it in the travel agency , too , plus a little Teamsters business . " She offered to keep her motor running and wait for him in the Impala while he changed into running clothes because she hated the plastic greediness and the recorded voices and clangs and bells and shrieks of Caesars Palace . ( " They make Ex Thou a minute , but who needs money if that 's the price ? " ) Or maybe he would just park the car and they would start running from the Impala , down to the MGM Grand , past the memories of terrible fire , where so many died and the insurance was such a hitch , across the Strip that direction  --  " Go get dressed , darling . "  |p164He  hurried , aware of all the gas she was using to keep the air conditioning going . But she was doing stretches in the blazing sunlight , waiting for him , and Veronica Velveeta was saying , almost as if she were talking to someone standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant before he arrived to stand in it himself , his feet sweating already in his Sauconys : " I 'm not homesick here , unh . Homesickness is a longing , unh , for something you do n't have in yourself , something Veronica is missing in her own being . I used to think a husband , a stall shower , a microwave oven would stop the homesickness . Unh . So we use sex for that purpose , but of course . " She stretched on her toes and reached for the sky . " Running really sweats it out  --  you want to run ? " He nodded . They ran . " It 's an attempt , " she muttered . She was finishing a thought . Probably it was the one about making love . Watkins understood why Veronica Velveeta was a good friend for Linda , but he did not understand why he was running with her , and why he had done what he had done with her , since he really liked ( was attracted to ) Linda , unless Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some manner he did n't understand very much or sympathize with at all . Nevertheless , just as he really liked Linda , he also enjoyed the freedom of running with Veronica Velveeta after they had sweetly made a kind of love which had little to do with her pleasure . He decided she had developed an unnaturally close and preciousrelationship with herself . " You are a liberated woman , " he said . " Do n't talk . Breaks breath . Some people say you should only run hard enough to keep a good conversation going , you know what I mean , not too hard , but in this heat , in this heat ... " He kicked a pebble and she winked at him . " Concrete , " she said , " not even a real rock . You know what I mean . Even the natural desert stuff comes from man-made materials . Lost Wages , Nevada . The real desert 's under Caesars Palace , all thatp165Old World charm and blackjack tables , but you 'd have to dig through the chips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can talk . I guess you got a good wind for a guy your age . Let me give you an example ... " To give him an example of Old World unreality and inflation in the desert , she told how many thou it cost to lease her narrow shop in the Desert Mall , where all the ladies with dark upper lips took orders for air travel both in the sky and on the ground by luxury Trailways . He forbore asking why she considered luxury Trailways a form of air travel . One foot ahead of the other . He forbore asking how she could come out with a profit and she appreciated his discretion . So she told him . " I have this associate . The deal works for him . Laundering some money he handles . " She was breathing regularly and deeply , but due to the running , the sentences were coming more crisply . " Good friend . Few years ago . Killed you . Would have killed you for what I did to you . An hour ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mellower now . Good friends and business associates . Would n't kill you today . Doubt even check up anymore . How little he cares . Just close friends and I launder his money . Is all , " she panted . Something in the peaceful mood of this roaming along the gritty road , with the desert sun beating down on the giant poured concrete and glass toys which money had transported onto the sand , with the friendly Mafiosa chatting comfortably about getting into health and murder and her affection for all people , especially androgynous young men , not counting Watkinsas such , of course , neither particularly young nor particularlyandrogynous , especially since she had done her time with the strong-smelling cigar-smoking macho sort  --  something in the pleasant exertion and the feeling of strength and release which came over Watkins made him feel he was running along a cool river , a kind of babbling at his sides , his lungs bombarded by the proper sorts of ions , negative ones , emitted by the bab/bling lady ; he was feeling good ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veronica , to Linda , to Bethany , to the complexluck of life on earth . " Maybe the only skinny kid who got real close to Howard Hughes in his long-toenail phase . Not a Mormon . That 's not his religion . Teamster was his religion . " Like many young women who have been hurt , have overcome the pain , once Veronica began to talk about a former lover with an understanding older man , a person with distinguished gray at his temples and firm thighs suitable for senior half-marathons , she sought to be complete about it . Not that love was ever complete . Even at the crest of mystic feelings of wholeness during the runner 's high , one still had toes , one still might sense a drop of sweat tickling someplace . " Howard thought he was a corner and so do I , but he came already . So now it 's launder launder launder , Wat , all the livelongday . " It did n't seem like the time and the place for mystic feelings of wholeness with the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck and deny it ? About this cool mental valley with its cool river shedding waterfall gusts of delightful ions over the embankment : In real life , Watkins and Veronica were now running past two hookers in hot pants , one black , one white , the black one in white satin pants with a gold chain loosely falling over her hips , the white one in black satin pants with a silver chain which was the twin of the gold one . The tight lines of their buttocks were pinched by the fitted costume . They strolled arm in arm , elbows linked , swinging along and giggling at the sight of the runners . " Hey man , look at them crazy dudes , " said the white one , and the black one said , " We could compose a good combo , " and the white one said , " Hey , you need somebody , it 's a job for two , lick that sweat off you guys ? " and the black one said , " You chaps use a little Clark County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " And they were still chattering , first one , then the other , taking turns , as Watkins and Veronica ran by . Evidently they hadp167enjoyed a prosperous morning already , or perhaps they were high on coke or some other girl 's helper , because the invitation was offered in good-natured fashion and rejection of it was acceptedin the same spirit . " Hey , bye now , babies ! " They went on giggling and clutching each other , elbows linked , gold and silver chains clashing in the sunlight . " See y'all now ! " Veronica ran Watkins safely back to the hotel . The greeny glade of ions and vale of mental cheer tended to fade , but Watkinsstill felt good . " You 'll have a nice shower and rest . You 'll sleep . Give all my love to Linda . " She unlocked the Impala and said , " Whew . Car heat . " And she was gone , waving good-bye and leaning so he could see her darkly mustached face in the rearview mirror . An Eldorado pulled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making laughing motions with their mouths and sticking out their tongues , too  --  the Clark County girls in hot pants . A chauffeur sat in front . Between the two women perched a hunched and sad little man , not yet cheered up as he soon would be , surrounded by Clark County vistas everyplace he looked or reached . What need had he of negative ions ? The stall shower is truly one of the great American inventions , assuming it is truly American , Watkins decided . Needles tingled over him , hot , then cold , then hot and cold again . He dried himself with a towel the size of a blanket , and then dropped naked into an acre of bed . It was no trouble to sleep . Thank you , all . He thought not about Linda , not about events of the recent or distant past , not about Veronica Velveeta and his good run and his practice of law ; he concentrated , as if some fever were receding , on sinking without a ripple . Oh , good . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps she had a master key . She was sitting on the bed and studying him when he awakened . He seemed to come awake naturally , not to be awakened . " Like a baby , " she said . " Even the grossest men sleep like babies  --  you 're not gross , however . " His mouth felt as if he were . He would n't tell her this , andp168he would n't be kissing her until after he brushed his teeth , if then . " How was Veronica ? " " Wuh ? " A trill of laughter . Lightly she touched his shoulder ; a familiar caress it might have been . He glared at her , sitting up in bed like a patient looking at the doctor who has come with the news that from now on his temperature will be taken by the nurse in the way she prefers . His knees were pulled up under the sheet . He was protecting his modesty as she went on being happy . " You 're nice , " she said . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whole subject behind us for the time being . For your sake . Veronica offered to help . The other person whose ad I answered  --  you 're not my first love , dear  --  was as nice as you but a little , oh , I 'd call it feeble . He did n't get any respect from his wife , he told me . He raised three kids , a boy sixteen , boy fourteen , girl twelve , but never any respect . When we had coffee , uh , afterwards , he counted out some dimes for the tip . And he kept his eye on those dimes when he asked me , down in the coffee shop , if it had been satisfactory for me on a scale of one to ten . You know ? Was it satisfactory ? Can you imagine ? As if anyone knows , anyway ? I think he wanted me to tell him about my kid . " Watkins glanced up sharply . Before they reply to my box , they reply to other boxes . " Used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a girl who has everything  --  young , good-looking and stupid . Which is how my daughter 'll grow up . But what could I do better for her ? Maybe I could see her way to be smarter , but what good is that , Watkins ? " " That 's a difficult question . You 've had a hard time to be so , well , cynical . It 's not necessary . " " While you were sleeping , " she said , " I looked in your wallet to see what your real name is , your age , whatever I could find . I did n't touch the money . Did n't lift a credit card . Thanks for telling the truth as far as you went , Watkins . " " You 're thoughtful , " he said , and feeling kind of good all atp169once ( compliments helped ) , just lumbered out of bed , his dong hanging , his sinewy behind as visible as it might be , and ambled across to the bathroom , where he shut the door but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . He gave special attention to the gums . When he returned , she had laid out his clean clothes for him . " You 're okay , " she said . " So are you . " " When it comes right down to it . . . " But she did n't finish this sentence . He did n't know what happened when it came right down to it . When he was nicely covered , she said , " Is that it for now ? You 've had your adventure ? " " I 'll go , " he said . " You 've had yours . " She watched him pack and told him her story . She was a reader of the National Enquirer , Guillaume Apollinaire and TristanCorbiere . " Those French writers of sixty years ago are really sexy and dirty , " she said . " They 're so suggestive , I mean . I mean ' l'urn of the Century . Apres guerre is sort of what I mean , too . " She had also had a daughter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , and after a few years in Washoe , now her parents were raising Elise , Lise , as their daughter in San Diego . The kid 's father needed to devote all his time to the wife who had everything . " When I go to see my kid , I 'm like a big sister , a sort of half sister . " " Must be difficult , " he said . " I do n't have maternal feelings for her . I like her . I feel like a big sister . " " You remind me of someone . " " I know , I know . Your old ladyfriend who did you wrong , Watkins . " She smiled . It must often have been the case for Linda . " She 's also funny , " he said . " They do a person wrong , the funny ones . " " Explain that to me , please . " Instead , she told him more about herself . Blackjack dealer ; he knew that . Former French student with Aid to Dependent Childrenplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowp170that . Now sometimes girl friend of a certain prince in Monaco . " Not an Arab , I 'll give you a hint . " " Rainier ? " " I only give one hint . " She lived in the asphalted heat of the desert here . The Clark County cops waved to her from their Fords and Mercurys . She was a native-born accountant at heart , she said , although she fucked up and that 's how she got into poetry and gaming instead . She thought she might make poetry of the save-up-forholidays , pre-honeymoon-test-drive visitors in Las Vegas . The ones who browsed in the Nieman-Marcus or the Bullocks at the new mall . The timid animals and the rough ones . " I 'm good at dealing cards for the same reason a paraplegic is good at having no use of his legs . I ca n't do anything else . " And then she added with a winsome smile : " You think I might be compelled to imagine you with Veronica , as if I 'm jealous , but I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I ca n't see sex as a movie or jealousy . But when people lose more money than they can afford , at my table , I mean , I always know . I think I can imagine the pain of others . Am I correct in thinking I can do this ? I see them creepingoff to throw up in their rooms , or to tell lies to the person who came with them , or to themselves . How come I 'm such a freak , Watkins ? And did you realize you laid yourself open to a freak in the columns of that newspaper ? " He looked at her and confessed that he too wrote poetry . In times of need , he did . It was someone to talk to . He apologized for mentioning it . He paused . She said she wanted to hear a poem . He said he coud n't recite them , he could only remember the idea . She asked him to tell her the idea . As best as he could remember it , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body is like the sea , " he recited . " It holds the heat at night , it holds the heat in the winter ... " " But a person can drown , " she said . " How did you know ? How did you know ? " he demanded angrily . This woman was dangerous . He wondered if he had enoughp171hope remaining to get interested in an intelligent woman with no manners . " What 's your idea of being married , I mean being goodtogethermarried , Watkins ? " " Should I tell you ? " She had asked , she said , did she have to repeat herself ? He stared into her eyes to let her know he 'd not say another word if she started to grin at him . To get up at dawn in a warm bed and go look out the window at the pink and purple of the not-yet-visible sun . Then to do bathroom things , rinse the mouth , brush the hair , scrub the face a little . Then to go see the first yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and cuddle against the spine of the sleeping , murmuring wife . To feel the warmth come back . To scratch her shoulder blades lightly and patiently , to rub patiently and lightly as she murmured and wiggled . To put himself between her . To wiggle together like two happy worms . She sighed . " What 's the matter ? " " Me too , " she said , " I 'd like something like that , a poetic husband who likes to look at the sunrise . But maybe I could wash my own face and brush the teeth , too , being married , while you did that . But I 'd be back in bed , pretending I was asleep when you got there . And I 'd manage to be warm . " They gazed tenderly at each other . They had lived through a long marriage and were proudly looking at the debris of their golden wedding celebration . They had lived a long hope together in a short time . " That 's nice , " he said . " Too damn bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a vagabond . " She sighed and spread her legs and flashed a bit of thigh and ran her fingers up the place between them . " I wrote to you , did n't I ? And invited you so nicely to come visit Las Vegas ? And arranged for Veronica to give you a good time ? And fool around with you ? " her fingers were playing ; her eyes were wet . Her fingers werep172poking . Tears were falling . " I must be a bum . You 're a smalltownlawyer-vagabond and I 'm different . I 'm a player . Now go home . Go back to your nice little town . Your garden . Your dream of cuddling with someone . Leave me alone . " " You brought me here to tell me to leave you alone ? " " Watkins : It 's not a movie , there 's some killings , blah blab blah , things finally get resolved , fade out as you walk away tall . It 's not like that . I want you to leave Clark County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you just stay here a while with me ? Maybe you have a friend , but you must have been interested , so what if we just go on like we are  --  " She glanced at the phone by the bed and the pressed-sawdust lamp with its painted knothole protuberances . " If I stayed here with you , " she said , " well , you would have a marvelous time . I would like that . For you , I 'm clean and nice , and for me , I like you . That 's the plus side . The minus side is you 'd never see the Las Vegas airport again . " He waited . Perhaps she had more to say . " You have a kind of mean or vengeful friend , Linda ? " " You would leave town for the desert outside , that 's all . Gopherswould make little holes in the mound . No trouble for him , and I suppose he 'd want to have a little honeymoon to celebrate  --  probably South Lake Tahoe . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat . I do n't suppose you 're talking about the fellow from Monaco . " She did not say . The phone began to ring . She raised her hand , indicating it was not necessary to pick up the phone . " It 's a sign of craziness not to take me seriously , Watkins , unless you just want to finish with this vale of shadows . Did n't you meet him at the desk when you came in ? Silk suit ? Ferde ? He does n't necessarily have an outstanding personality , but it would have been smart to notice him , or at least notice what I left out . Sometimes he 's dormant , Watkins , but then he 's malignant . " " Okay . " " I served your purpose . Some excitement , a couple of modern American adventures . And you served mine . So I 'm grateful andp173I want to give you a chance . " The phone was still ringing . Her hand was on it . " It 's for me , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chill night winds from the desert . " Get out before I pick this up . Your clothes will be downstairs at the desk . You probably wo n't have to pay . Compliments of the house , my dear . "  |p175Velvety  wolf-headed violets grew in a low row near the stairway to HumanHouse . Someone sought to bring beauty here . A breeze ruffled their small faces as Watkins tramped up the steps toward the regular meeting . " You used to be first one in , Wat . " " I 'm not late , am I ? " " No , but almost . " Then Pete wondered how Watkins 's nose happened to appear to be so sunburned and Watkins said the appearance reflected a reality , nose left out in the sun , and Pete was n't satisfied , in general , with Watkins 's answers . Pete Positano was doing his best to make this group work , even if certain members had no sense of what it meant to be twice-born and they kept their character armor on and they sneered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of us except the mindfuckers . Rod , Fred and Chuck were willing to listen . The moral pressure was global . Pete counted on the group to help save any soulless souls which happened to find themselves on site . If they could be saved , the group inspired by the fire of Pete Positano was here to do it . He understood that appearances were a metaphorfor reality ; that 's how profound he was . " You would n't believe what mystical science is giving us these days . You try listening to me , Wat . Recently I discovered you can have a thought caused by something that has n't happenedyet . This is because time is bent . It 's curvy . Not many folks have caught on yet . For example , I 'm working on equipment to send messages faster-than-light backward in time . Well , not the equipment , but the basic theory . You think this does n't explainp176all the prophets ? Sure as Delphic Oracles it does . And the DNA code , too . Plus how the KGB is plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a high-octane earthquake pretty soon willed , this time . This is state-of-the-art stuff . You think the CIA got an answer or even a second-strike capability  --  black holes ? tidal waves ? spirit drills ? Shit no . We 're defenseless unless we wake up from our long slumber ! " " How do you know ? " Fred asked . " Give us some evidence , Pete . " " I 'd like a few details on the physics side , " Chuck said . " It 's a good probe , " Rod said . " One thing we all got to know about the right-brain side of us is keep the feminine left brain in mind . Or is it the other way around ? " " If you 're really powerful , " Pete said , " you get these takes all the time . It 's simple . It 's only the new postmodern physics . Tell me if I 'm wrong , Chuck , but does n't laser theory bear me out in a small way even if some legalistic mindfuckers doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular and physically powerful , he liked to think things through . He did n't have a quick answer to the apocalypse . " Thanks for the tip , Pete , " Watkins said . " Thanks for the tip ! Thanks for the tip ! That 's how all the prophetsgot turned off . Thank you very much , and climb up on that cross . " Pete paused . He knew that a soft answer sometimes turneth away wrath . " I do n't want to go that far about me , " he said softly . " Anybody who thinks like that has got to be a little paranoid , except if he 's not . So instead let 's talk about our friend the mindfucker . Wats is so sure of his hang-ups he can leave them festering . He can run away and have fun in the sun and exploit some poor lonely woman and come back to find his grief waiting for him like a pet dog . Goddamn you , Wat . " Watkins held his knees and bided his time . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete was right that he could not outrun his griefs . He regretted a certain snottiness that gave him an advantage on nobody , and did n't help with the griefs , either.  |p177Pete  frowned jovially ; it was another talent he had . He could also lay it on the line deviously , sneakily upfront gut-level , becauseof so many faster-than-light laser crosscurrents in his soul . He was angry , but he was all-forgiving . He contained multitudes . This was the 198os , when microchip refinements to the 196os were finally coming on line . The 197os had been a holding pattern . Even Pete 's clothes did n't wear out in the 197os . Now all Pete asked was the largeness of soul to submit to him . " You know how some cops are on the take ? " he asked . " Well , I 'm on the give , man . Help me give to you ! " And what if Pete were right about Watkins and women ? " So I 'll continue , " Pete said . Rod , Fred and Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his knees were losing a bit of circulation and if he did n't want this extra tingle he should ease up . He eased up . He offered no objection . Now that Pete had disposed of the relation of international thought control and curvy state-of-the-art time geography to the new physics , he could get back to something nearer and dearer  --  Watkins 's love life . His receptors picked up static in Watkins 's aura . Wat was AM when he should be FM . He was still playing Top Forty when the world had moved both forward and backward . " You 're really , really , " said Pete , " into life-size sex aids , are n't you , Wat ? I mean women . " " I never heard them called that . " " Now you did . Think about it . They breathe , they wiggle , they heat up ? Is that all they are to you ? " Watkins was the last to disagree that he was having troubles with women . Yet he disagreed . Crazy Pete . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself as merely a careless mourner , employinganonymous persons to make memorial sounds , cuddling to melancholy and loss . But if Pete were right ? Was he smug in his yearning for Bethany ? Were these women just appetizers to create a tastier sorrow , this chase after the box numbers , this . consciousness raising with his fellow lads at HumanHouse ? One day he was running along the Las Vegas strip with Veronicap178Velveeta , and the same day he was thinking about poor sensitive Linda with the disturbed family arrangements while she was asking him to hurry up and not get killed in Clark County , and two days later he was discussing the Word of Pete on paisley pillows in a psychedelic rumpus room . He was putting his own life into night court and touring it with a bunch of nosy paralegals . By this time his education should have progressed . He had paid the penalty of loss . He had served his parole in the custody of Bethany . She informed him it was time to move on . She was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Then how to explain the night sweats , the lurch in belly , the ceaseless imagining of Bethany 's light wet slippery flutterings as she lay beneath him and her legs flew up to squeeze his shoulders ? And how her hands pressed on his behind . Her fingers dug . How she wanted to extract every drop of him . That fizzy scent . How he could n't stop remembering even when she no longer wanted any drop of him . . . " Wat , are you paying attention ? Do you care what we know and decide about you ? " Pete was asking . When she said to turn away , he turned away , just as she commanded . He hardly thought of her husband 's heavy thrust in her . He simply turned away . Smug , was he ? Smug in his grief ? Goddamn mindfucker Pete . " I 'm listening , " Watkins said . " Did you happen to say something I should hear , Pete ? " Pete had a good karma catered by Werner Erhard , Baba Ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east ; Brooklyn , that is . He was authentically derived from many quests and therapeutic breakthroughs . His smile was beautiful . His teeth were an authentic miracle for a man of his age who used to smoke tobacco and still smoked controlled substances for purposes of enlightenment only , or maybe getting it on once in a while . He was hopeful and brilliant , a boy whose smile declared , I 'm centered , and whose nervous eyes asked , What 's centered ? Re/cently the new physics had given him a whole new line on things . So today he wanted to work on Watkins . He went to work . The rage was rising in him  --  a centered , peaceful , affable rage . Watkins wanted to say Brother to Pete Positano because he also felt that good-tempered desire to kill . There was a slight lockerroomsmell to the room with its pillows ; this was n't just stocking feet and shoes lined up in a corner . It was Pete and Watkins getting something on , and Fred , Rod and Chuck were alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , good cheer on its way ! War can be such fun , when fought with intergalactic metaphysical missiles and submarine ego digs in the encounter room of HumanHouse . " Let me ask something , " Pete stated . " What kind of a lawyer is it that stalls all the time ? " " It 's called asking for a continuance . No special kind of lawyer . It 's part of the legal process . " " Do you think you 're a kind of philosopher , Wat ? " " I think . Probably think too much about myself . " " Oh , boy , " said Pete . " You want a continuance ? You 'd like tostall a little ? Or would you like to get right down to it , Mr.Watkins Old Pal Good Friend of My Ex-Wife ? " Watkins was weary of hunting down the ladies Bethany found for him . Las Vegas had taken some of the starch out . If this was the quest for true love , he was ready to try for a little brotherly hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised a hand in a pupil 's gesture : " May I inquire something ? Just asking . Why is it the one who talks about mindfucking always comes in late , as if he 's too busy to waste his time but wants everyone else to waste ours waiting for him ? Could I have an answer to that , please ? " Pete was taking little gulps of air . Watkins liked that . In battle , he also made little gulps of air when attacked where it hurt . " Please do n't tell me , " Watkins said , " not again , it 's because . you 're so powerful and I should stand away from the flame . "  |p180It  felt nice to swing away , even if only with words . Hatred made revenge a happy experience . Pete too was filled with joy . " That 's a high yoga , man , " he said , " a boss boogie . I enjoy you , Wat , I sure do . I was with Werner the other weekend , a whole weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man , you give me the power . ' Cause I can deal so good with mindfucking folks like you , man . " Sixties jive gave the fallen Catholic , fallen Italian , fallen KaiserPlan therapist with the new earring in his ear the authentic power . The power the canary flower child and Harvard psychologist , Timothy Leary , a personal friend of Pete 's , had lent him  --  some of that authentic white-teeth force . Pete took the power from all sides . I am myself if I am somebody else . " Have you done est ? " Watkins asked him . " Man , you 're mindfucking again . " " Did you do est ? " " What does that have to do with it ? " " Did you do est ? " Chuck and Fred and Rod looked interested . They tapped fingertips , they pursed lips , they nodded encouragement . " Well , " said Pete , " I spent a couple weekends with Werner ... you mindfucker . " " Uh-huh . Well , it would save some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yes . I mean , if you have the power through est , you should n't be afraid of a yes answer in the affirmative mode . " " Lemme lay a personal hang-up on you , " said Pete . " I 'll show how honest I can get . I take responsibility for myself . I 'm not chicken . I 'm committed to change and growth , my karma is on the line . I 'll answer your question , Wat . The bosses in my departmentdo n't hassle me so much , but my fellow wage slaves do , and then the bosses get involved and they hassle me . It 's my ideas , my growth , my power . I got a good job , bro , I 'm fuckin ' good at it , so they ca n't fire me unless they moral turpentine me , tenure is freedom , man  --  but I ai n't gon na do nothin ' harms me , not this sister , no messing around illegally . I 'm just gon na toast on my own flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warlike life . They can go fuck themselves . " He leaned back ,  |p181crossed  his arms , put on his Indian inscrutable mask . " Is that a yes for you ? " he asked . " Wat , now you see how a man of power responds ? " Chuck , Fred and Rod were trying to figure out what they had just heard . They were running it through the computer . Watkinsagreed that Pete had won a round of camouflage from him . He had thought the group would dilute some of his worries about true love and digging into his soul and not just being so longing and in dearth and need all the time . Oh , that 's not clear . Fuzziness is n't necessarily sincere . Try again . He wanted to be more contented with his lot with women , or with his lack of lot , or to discover how the lack was in him , or if it was just fate , or perhaps just merely his own inefficiency as a coveter and cuddler  --  oh , it keeps coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wolf-faced violets into HumanHouse . Pete , you 're changing the rules . I know these are changing times , but I want the old rules back , Pete . Watkins decided to try for a comeback . Pete presented himself , preening over recent triumphs . Watkins remembered the trick of a low voice that made juries lean forward to hear . " Sometimes I think , " he began , and Rod , Chuck and Fred leaned forward to hear , " sometimes I think you think you 're looking in a mirror , Pete , and you see a lot of hair and dirt and interesting darkness . But you 're not looking in a mirror . You 're bent over to look up your own behind . " " Haha . Haha , " Pete said . " Self-involved , am I ? And you 're not , Watkins ? Proctologist , heal thyself . So you 're here just because you like to sit on the floor on fat pillows ? " . Watkins gave Pete another victory . He could tell because he suddenly felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a bit bent over these days , too , Pete , " he said . " I think I better take responsibility for that . " Pete looked at him shrewdly . " You 're saying it . I 'll give you credit . But only for saying it , pal . " Watkins had noticed that women did not turn out to be the main business . The program in IumanHouse was the raising of men 's understanding . The opposite and often opposing sexp182was not his friends ' chief worry . Perhaps theirs was the correct way to proceed . Watkins was willing to grant that Pete , noisy Pete , might have a point . This anger , suspicion , mistrust and boyish optimism about changing everything through love might be buried balls-high within other concerns  --  power , ambition , work , even connections with other men  --  yes , Pete , okay , I concede  --  thereare different loves and connections among human beings in the world where everyone is born to die and let 's not forget it . Why do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for abalone , and I only found out because I happened to look at an old newspaper in the kitchen ? Okay , Pete , you serve the time and you 're right to do so . For purposes of comfortable argument . Watkins knew from experience that he could think anything he liked and even if people were watching him shrewdly , as Pete was now doing , they would n't necessarily read his secrets . This was one of the things adult life had taught him ; not an awful lot , but a help . Probably women also entered groups with the hope of frettingover men and ended with other concerns . The lads at HumanHousehad even turned away from Chuck 's problem with his wife . Chuck seemed easier with no attention being paid . Watkins forgot to worry about whether Chuck and Mrs. Chuck ( Anne-Marie ) were having fun together . Rod , Fred and Pete were not worrying . Perhaps Chuck had found that his brief ventilation in this room  --  his fibrillation , his hyperventilation  --  gave him the spasm of relief he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates discussing Greek myth : " Hera changed into a duck , so Zeus had a spaz . " ) Pete had his spaz over Watkins almost every session , but withoutrelief . Something in Watkins nagged at Pete and something in Pete Positano wanted to nag at his former friend . Thanks to open , frank , honest sharing and caring , they had become former friends . Pete was beginning to work on family problems . He was a helping professional with two ex-wives and three exchildren ; a free spirit with tenure , and the pleasure of not having to keep up an office or pay malpractice insurance ; a devotedp183observer of Watkins , whom he was jovially asking : " Why are n't you a together person ? " Watkins knew this question from the law . It was a helping version of When did you stop beating your wife ? Watkins gave it a D-minus and a shrug . " Liar , " said Pete . " I did n't say anything . " " Yeah , but I can read your mind . Your mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And in your head , " Pete said , " you just called me mind-fucker . " Goddamn if this frantic wiseass could n't read him sometimes , not so well as he thought , but sometimes and well enough . And nevertheless , for reasons which came of the intimacy of abuse , of this sprawling male abusive camaraderie , of this freeing of spite and the spirit of destruction , Watkins now began to be fond of Pete once more . Pete had a way of keeping things movingand alive . They could bounce off him . He was a kind of barrier with his own built-in bounce to transmit . And he had been right about something . Watkins admired him for that . " Let me inform you categorically , " Pete said , " let me stipulate this . Unlike some mindfuckers I happen to know , I 'm not stuck in the past . Whatever my own opinion might be , it 's a probe . I do n't necessarily agree with it . " " You do n't necessarily agree with your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? He 's doing it again . " . Suddenly Pete slid forward without standing up . He propelledhimself with his hands , like a legless vendor . He was n't finished with astonishments . He threw his arms around Watkins , . who struggled manfully against the smell of male armpit soaking through turtleneck and the shell necklace cutting into his cheek , saying , " Hey ! Hey ! " " You 're a mindfucker , " Pete panted , " but I like what you 're selling ! I 'm buying ! " Watkins extricated himself and crouched in semikarate position to repel further assault . Chuck , near/sighted , was peering intently at these men who seemed really to have a life together . They did n't have wives . Pete was advancing toward Watkins again . " Let 's boogie , Wat . I get kind of pissed , but your aura , it 's magic . Hopefully , we can be buddies again when all this shit has gone down  --  you know what I mean ? " He slid back with adroit hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wary , Watkins would not commit himself . English was his language and he was n't sure he understood Encounter . He sat back down . Rod relieved the problems of translation and response by rapping softly with his fingernails at a worn place in the carpet where he could get a crablike rustle against the wooden floor . Rod wished they might return to business  --  not in an elitist way of insisting  --  he just declared that he wished it . " Love , " he said , " is the original question that brought us together . Love of women , love of each other , love of the eternal principle of righteousnesswhich we call "  --  and he blushed for using the dirty word  --  " which we call Supreme Being . Do I have the sense of the group that we could  --  ? " " Can a truly great humanist be smug ? " Watkins interrupted . " What ? " It seemed as if everyone asked at once . " Just wondering , " Watkins said . " You may proceed . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Tell us about love and how you manage it . " " Love ? You fall in love , Wat , I do n't fall in love . You got it all wrong . The love is in me . When you realize that  --  if you do , fella  --  you 're home free . You do n't fall in it , you bring it out ' cause it 's already there . The toughness is in me , too , and I like it that way . I 'm proud of how strong I am , my sacred fire . Listen , I won it the hard way . I have a little saying about that : I paid my dues . That means , well , you can figure it . When my first wife left me , Elaine , you remember , Wat  --  I stared at the wall for a fucking year . No , nine months . Just catatoned . But then at a Laundromat I met Laurie . She told me about fabric softener and it was great . She said Washeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p185wow  . A High Yellow . I guess it 's true what they say  --  the Kama Sutra Kid , I called her . And then it unraveled , she was too flippy , flakey , so I met Jennie . We both felt the same way  --  zap ! Love again ! There it is , a sociological fact . Jennie wanted the child trip , the marriage trip , that 's what she thought . But like I explained to her , the love is in me , it 's all got to be really mine . So then I met Stanley . " He looked each of them in the eyes before he continued , Fred last . " And just a week ago I met  --  after all these sessions  --  I really met Fred . " " Pardon ? " Chuck asked . Fred looked downcast and shy . He plucked at his socks between his toes . " Which does n't mean , " Pete added , " I do n't really get my rocks off with women , too . And Watkins was a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I fully understand comes from all his own sadness he ca n't really share with us yet because he 's not capable . " Fred said , " Which does n't mean I do n't still have my wife and kids , that 's my main thing in life also . " Pete and Fred gazed tenderly at each other . It was deep male understanding between these two , not just what other people might think . The matching earrings  --  left ear for Pete , right one for Fred  --  caught the light like a whisper . This makes no sense , Watkins thought , it 's just an unnecessary complication . Fred and Pete beamed . Watkins knew he was uptight . Fred and Pete were happy . Despite his earnest efforts , Watkins was not . The world was a song and a festival for Fred and Pete . Watkins thought : Ick , back to the pay toilets in Sacramento . . Chuck said , " I 've been thinking about a vasectomy . Of course , in your case , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to take responsibility for the damage I do to her body . Of course , that 's just us  --  " Watkins wondered if Chuck saw revealed a new solution to his problems . Rod said , " I feel sleepy . I do n't think I 'm out of touch . I 'm here . I 'm centered . But maybe this room is kind of stuffy and we should open the window more . I feel kind of logy. "  |p186Watkins  understood Rod 's drowsiness . It might be nice just to curl up and doze off . He too felt outnumbered by the announcementfrom the new couple , Fred and Pete . It had not been a part of the plan . In the years he had associated in the faculty Senate with Pete Positano , he had not suspected how open he was to the solution of problems . Well , if it works , it works ; if it happens , it happens ; that 's the American way . Pete explained it happens in women 's groups also , which he knew because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a feminist , Pete , " Fred said . " Do n't forget me . " " You 're my best friend , too , " Pete said . " That 's the love that 's in me today . " Rod declared their time up for this session . He hoped everyone had gained something to think about . Watkins was thinking about Fred and Pete , not Bethany . Well , he had gained that much . A few days later they were burning the rice fields again . The acrid smoke drifted across town as Watkins strolled toward the campus , and grew stronger among the green quads and bicycles and rangy California young people as he strolled a curving walk toward HumanHouse . The scorched rice husk smell reminded him of coal dust , odd in this fresh dry air . A law student in a vested suit , success-bound , tipped his hand to his forehead in a downtown-styled salute as Watkins passed . " Sir , " he said . In his own private ledger of the steps to achievement , he gave himself another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishedadjunct professor who could soon be asked to write letters of recommendation . Watkins was heading toward Pete , Rod , Fred , their session together . The little row of velvety , wolf-faced violets nodded continuallyin the breeze . Tough stems and persistence , tough velvet ; this was a reassurance for Watkins . The fellows removed their shoes at the door and lined them up neatly , like the kids of Watkins 's childhood leaving galoshes in the cloakroom . They sprawled against their pillows and Pete said almost immediately , " Do you love me ? I 've been thinkingp187and I decided I 've got to get it straight with you guys . " " Uh-oh , " said Watkins . " Do you love me ? I want to be accepted for what I am , not this not that , but me ! " Rod finally spoke up . " Well , I accept you , Pete , I really do . But your aggressiveness  --  your fire and feistiness , Pete , which I truly admire  --  " " I 'm not a cafeteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole or I 'm nothing ! And I 'm something ! " Rod nodded . " I do , " he said . It was easier , it was also more facilitating , to agree . " Look here ! I 'm into my yangness . I love Freddie over there . " ( Fred was fingering his earring and blushing . ) " He does n't play macho games . He does his thing sweetly , with kindness in his heart  --  " Fred whispered , " But I wish I had some of your power , Pete . " Pete burped . In passion he swallowed air . Flesh and blood have habits ; this was his . " I 'm not arrogant , I 'm me . If you perceive me as threatening , like the mindfucker over there does , that 's his problem . I 'm me , you 're you . One thing I ca n't stand is pigism , sexism , racism or elitism in any form . " " Or jargonism , " Watkins said , and then hastily added : " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said it , I did n't . " Pete momentarily looked shy and puzzled . He was searching for another way to say it . He did n't find it . Silence surged softly over the five men struggling in this room to refresh their souls . Five grown men , Watkins thought . After a pause , smells of anxiety and feet , distant taste of burningrice husks , Chuck said to Rod , " Where are you today ? I do n't feel you , Rod . " " I 'm fine . My sinus . I think I 'm allergic to rice burning . My wife says it 's house dust and I should vacuum more . Just coming off some heavy antihistamine is all . " " Thank you for that report on your domestic sinus arrangements , " Pete said . " Do I have to spend my time on this shit ? " . Rod said , " Thank you for sharing your impatience with us , Pete . " Ile blew his nose ; how fast the cavities fill up again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your input that the sinus is an extension of the brain both biologically and psychologically  --  scienceteaches this . " " My kids , " Chuck said , " they 're feeling the pressure . I think they feel something about their mother , Anne-Marie , and me . I feel they kind of feel the lack of feeling , not the lack of feeling exactly , but the lack of . . . feeling . " " Let 's talk about vasectomies , " Pete said . " For example , sex is never better . You 're not laying a trip on the lady . " ( Fred looked hurt . Pete shot a warning glance at him  --  no sexist jealousyallowed . ) " She does n't have to take responsibility , and that 's courteous of the man , be takes . You tell her up front you 're not interested in babies . Zero population blah blah blah . I think you 'd like it , Chuck , and then you would n't have to deal with your kids , your wife 's resentments  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , not the past  --  " " You 're still in a linear time frame , are n't you , Wat ? " Pete inquired with rare sympathy for Watkins 's limitations . Fred must have been contributing a measure of dampening peace to Pete 's fire . But now Fred was hurt and taking the line of not being interested . He was staring at the paisley pillows with his eyes rotating slightly to give him a kaleidoscope sensation . He was emitting interest in his experiment . Or maybe he just felt blank and uninvolved after his twenty seconds of intense , illegal and forbidden jealousy . " Well , if I do n't stay with my wife , " said Chuck , " just assuming , I might meet a girl and we might , who knows  --  " " Man , sex is never better . I had mine at the beginning of that last horrible decade , man , got myself cut and trimmed , and it saved the seventies for me . Just pulled it right out . Man , it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man  --  it takes you right back to the Summer of Love , just turns it around and  --  "  | " I know , I know the engineering of it , " said Chuck . " It 's physiology , though . " " If you have any doubts , then do n't do it . " " I have some doubts . " " Well , I 'm telling you where I stand . That 's my input . Trust me . Just do what I say . " " Are we statistics ? " Watkins asked . " Are we decades ? If we 're into natural human relations , this two point eight kids is just another idea . How about my brothers who do n't have any kids ? Do I get to use their quotas ? " " You have brothers ? " Rod asked . " What kind ? I mean , how old ? They 're younger siblings ? " Pete was squinting winsomely at Fred . He was making amends for talking about women to Chuck . He was ignoring Watkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobe and asked , " What does that mean ? " " It symbolizes I 'm different , a gypsy , in my heart a gypsy even if I got tenure here at UC-Davis , it reminds me I 'm not like everyone else , I do things my own blessed way . " " It 's multipurpose , is n't it ? " Watkins said . " Anything else ? " Pete and Fred gave each other a long gleamy sea lion stare . Then , to Watkins , Pete directed a half-lotus-based marine salute , snapping it off . They were supposed to tell the truth , and yet Watkins was a mindfucker who only deserved loving , caring , I-and-thou put-downs . " It symbolizes , " Fred began again , " well , okay , I 'm not only making it with Pete , I 'm open to my bisexuality . But I also dig my wife and kids , whatever kind of pain they bring me . Okay ? " " Even if they 're a drag , " said Watkins . Pete , smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood up and snapped off another marine salute at Watkins . " I 'm a violent man , " he said . " Do you know how close you are to getting a paste in the mouth ? " Watkins stood up and said , " I know how close I am , " and . waited.  |p190Nothing  . Rod spoke in a droning voice . Probably he selected this voice carefully . " It 's been a good session . We got some bad shit out . I think they got another group coming in to use the room , so see you next time . " As they left , Watkins wanted to express fraternity with Chuck by saying , " That Pete , he . . . " But Pete 's gleamy eyes caught Watkins . It was permissively forbidden to carry resentment out of the room in which they were wrangling and creating intimacy . Resentment was not the goal . This was a space shuttle in which they careened . History had launched them on simulated space travel , but the queasy weightlessness was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweaty place of confession and what Rod called " support . " The fuss of their dealings had grown as busy as family : " Do you have to smoke ? " " Do you need to stick your bare feet under our noses ? " " Why do you always pull back and then make us repeat what we said , you deaf , are you getting deaf or dumb ? " " Why do n't you sit closer , are you separating yourself from the rest of us idiots ? " " I guess I should sit closer , " Watkins had admitted . Watkins guessed this nagging and fussing was a part of their business together . They huddled . He was waiting for true love in a group which was asking , Are we afraid of dying , is that why we do n't manage age and disappearance ? Are we afraid of women , is that why we chase true love ? Is that what the group was asking ? His colleagues here were nattering and babbling and putting earrings in their ears and words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . He would wait to see if something came up . Without Bethany , without true or false love , time stretched over clarity like the burning rice fog . The women who replied to his box were each some kind of miracle , but not what he required . His privacy was precious to him , but not his hours and days , not his sleepless nights . Such was the time of his life in which he dwelled . He woke up at midnight and made coffee for himself . He would n't sleep anyway . He tried to read and fell asleep . He awakened and waited for thep191dawn . He brushed and flossed . He fidgeted . Why , during the night , did it abruptly thrust him out of sleep to think how cleverly Bethany had deserted him ? His heart thumped and she was too clever by half . She had worked out a solution for him and she had let him down . She had said : " No more explanations , because it 's obvious , is n't it ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clutching of the sheets sent him was : I ca n't handle it . By the time he got out of bed the sheet was rolled into a wet club . Okay , today was another session at HumanHouse . Okay , he decided to tell the truth to his good friends and enemies . By the time he walked through campus , in full morning , his eyes still rasped by the sleep-lorn middle of the night  --  and the bicycles floated past with the lovely dreamy faces , and the studentswith backpacks , the stooped or athletic boychildren , girlchildren , perpetual children , the elderly faculty  --  and the dewy earnestness and innocence of everyone 's striving to make a career , plus the goddamned sensual anxiety and comfort of campus  --  hewas no longer a jittery insomniac . He was an alert fuzzy-headed insomniac . He heard his own footsteps from afar as if he were very tall . Up the eroded stairs of HumanHouse , past the violets with their frayed yellow petals and their black wolf faces , past the everready , loose-lipped coffeemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to play the game . Pete Positano was there already . " Pete , " he said , " you win . " " What do I win this time ? " " Something , Pete . You have n't had the story right , but now I 'll just hand it over . " He told them about himself , about Bethany , about her , about them . He left out the true loves for whom he had advertised . They did n't need to know that . He left out Bethany 's name . They did n't need to know that . He left in his need and lack and loss and grief . " I 've been dying for the love of an inappropriate . woman , " he said . " What do you make of that ? " " Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh , " said Rod . " Is that the story ? "  |p192Even  Pete did n't say : Is that all ? What are you leaving out ? Watkins was as grateful for his silence as if he had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete 's eyes glow with Watkins 's discomfort ; sympathy or satisfaction brought that wetness of light  --  it did n't matter what brought it . Watkins had fallen into disclosure . Pete was with him now . He was leaning forward and listening and nodding his head sharply ; he was giving feeling back to his old friend . " I 've had this woman in my head every minute of the day or night , I do n't think she should be there but she is , I have these times when I ca n't stand myself or anyone and I want to die but I think maybe she 'll change her mind so I run the routines , I do n't die , no , I wo n't do that  --  " Rod , concerned but a little sleepy ; Fred , thinking about himself and checking Watkins 's obsession against his own accommodationsto his wife and to Pete ; Chuck , sturdy and sad and measuring and not getting any love from his inappropriate woman , either . A lot of words by Watkins . An avowal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who is it , Wat ? " Pete asked . Watkins stared . No one repeated the question . Even Pete knew enough not to ask again . Rod got up , left the room and came back with a foam-andclothcudgel , lumpish of form , made in Venice , California , and said delicately and mildly : " Depression is blocked anger . Here , it helps to pound . Hit , please . " He yawned . " Pardon . Hit the floor . Hit the pillow . Hit me . " Watkins picked up the padded thuggish weapon and said pedantically , " This is called a slapstick . Too big to pick your teeth . It makes people feel funny on stage when someone  --  " " Naming it ! Words ! Mindfucker ! " Pete flailed the air from a half-lotus position . " Come on , man , hit it ! " Watkins waved the foam bludgeon in the air . He felt foolish . " Come on ! " Pete screamed . Watkins let it topple . It looked limp . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He slapped it twice , softly , against the floor . He felt nothing . He felt nothing.  | " I do n't feel like it , " he said . " Goddamn , we 're wasting our valuable time , Wat . " Softly Rod said , " Watkins must feel you 're manipulative , Pete . He must feel you are pressuring . " " Shit no ! I would n't lay a heavy trip on that mindfucker because I want to assist the snotty bastard . " " I feel , " said Watkins , " I feel , Pete  --  " " Hit it , goddamnit , why are we talking ? I got better places to be ! Why ca n't you acknowledge your feelings ? " " I 'm angry . I 'm depressed . I acknowledged . I do n't feel like hitting a pillow with a piece of foam . " " Hey , " said Chuck , " why do n't we wrestle , Wat ? You ever wrestle ? " " Not since I was a kid . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's wrestle . You want to wrestle ? " " I do n't  --  " " Come on . " Chuck 's hoarse voice startled everyone . " Come on , you bastard ! " Watkins lunged at him . They rolled on the floor . An immense heat suffused Watkins 's chest and shoulders . A nail scratched his neck . He pulled his head down . He flipped around . He tried to press Chuck to the carpet . Chuck twisted . Watkins was embracingthis thick , muscular , sweating , middle-aged engineer 's body  --  this poor stub whom he had pitied so when he spoke of his nonangry wife . Chuck was grunting and whooshing great moans . Watkins started to laugh , but there was no time for it , no breath . He was fighting for his life . There was slime on his chest , shoulders , cheeks . He pinned Chuck twice , but maybe Chuck was letting him do it . Chuck was surely stronger , younger , more thick with clotted rage . Or perhaps Watkins was so angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck was thinking about not hurting him  --  was that possible ? Watkins pinned him panting to the carpet . Chuck tapped his hack . You can get up now . " You feel better ? " Chuck inquired . Tears were coming from Watkins 's eyes . I le wanted to apolo/gize and tell everyone not to feel bad for him , those were selfish tears , they were only for himself , he had n't earned anyone 's pity . " You feel better ? " " Yeah , Pete . Okay . So you win a round . I feel better . "  |p195Bethany  had never returned the key to his house . A normal man might worry that she would come in unannounced or when he was n't home ; Watkins worried that she might not . Another man might fear she would surprise him while he was with another woman , rattling her equipment and tromping around , indignant . Watkins knew she had no intention to do so . Nor would it happen accidentally . No indignant rattling or tromping ; no eyes suddenly red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazed astonishments . Not unless it was what suited her . She may have kept the key because of some sentimental memoryor memories of him , using it as a paperweight . Clear eyed , she might mist for a moment or two , no worse than a dose of Murine . Or she may have kept the key because she plain did n't notice . When she noticed  --  oh dear , what 's this ?  --  she might return it . Or more likely , she assumed he could afford to make duplicates if he needed them . And because there was a touch of delicacy in Bethany , practical delicacy , as demonstrated by her energy on his behalf , she would not return the key now because , at this time , tardy in the closing-down of their afternoons , it would seem symbolic of something  --  of the closing and the locking  --  and who needed such symbols ? She may not have kept the key at all . She may have left it behind a cushion or under the dish drainer . She may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the psychological profile , with testimony from personalexperience , not hearsay , indicated the latter , according to counsel . Key did n't interest Mrs. Andrews.  |p196Watkins  was proud of his ability to avoid harassing Bethany . It was something to cling to . Self-respect never hurt a person . Although the town was small , and one 's habits and routes in such a town were predictable , and he could easily have placed himself unobtrusively in her path now and then , at the Safeway or the tennis courts , for example , he did not . He shopped for himself at different hours . He drove down different streets from the ones she frequented . He avoided the tennis courts at the hours when she played , before her kiddies got home from school . Mostly he did that . Sometimes he did n't , and his heart thumped with the possibility of seeing her and the shame of searching for her . He did n't catch a glimpse of her except when he did , and then he regretted this hungry hollow yearning . I guess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the opposite of the runner 's high . Also the experience of the loss of self-respect lets a person know that his original idea , which was to behave with dignity , no weeping in public , no moping or begging , was the better one . If he happened to drive past the courts , stop , stroll , push through the bushes and catch her eye just as she was arching her back for a serve , well , he would merely tip his hat and wish her a good day . Unfortunately , he did n't wear a hat . Sometimes he had pleasant dreams about Bethany and sometimes he had less pleasant ones . Sometimes he was asleep when he had these dreams , and all too often he was awake . In her tennis whites the tennis saint appeared at HumanHouse , confrontingPete , His Radiance , and Rod , and sturdy Chuck , and unsturdy Fred : " Boys , I 've heard so much about you . The truth is , boys , you 're not as interesting as tennis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in despair when this lovely woman in a red sports car , it was the dentist 's , drove alongside and they were both waiting for the light to change and it turned green but he shouted , " Stop ! Wait ! " and she asked , " What do you want ? " and in his dream he said , " True love , " and she glanced at her watch , she checked it against the clock in front of the Navajo jewelry shop , she said , " Oh , then get in , "  |p197and  he abandoned his fairly new Saab , he climbed in beside her , they drove off , leaving the other motorists honking at his automobilejust abandoned like that on E Street .. . All of which tended to mean that when Bethany really did telephone again ( " Hi ! It 's Bethany ! You remember Bethany Andrews ? " ) , Watkins put an easy smile on his face to cover his surprise for the no one who was watching ( " Hello , Bethany , how are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial social touching of base and not simply what he had been praying for , asleep and awake , living for , dying for , while he moped around Davis and Dixon and Woodland , and ran off to Las Vegas or Los Angeles or San Francisco in search of the true love which Bethanyhad sort of tried to arrange for him . He was going to handle this telephone call like a solid baseline player . " Time to ask how go things , Wat . " " Fine . " " I mean our project . Time to ask , if you have n't just been lazy , which one turned out to be great and which merely good . " " All good I guess , Bethany . Maybe none great ? " " Not even one ? " " Define great , Bethany . " " Oh . That 's a question , I guess . Kudos for sharp thinking , Wat . " She considered the problem of communication , private need and where a man like Watkins might locate his hopes in collaboration with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could be . . . " she began . His heart . His face . His shame . " It could be we should confer on this in person , Wat . " She hung up . She did not say when . She did not say wait . She just took it for granted that he had nothing better to do than to stay where he was until she got there . He might take the ragged layers of newspapers from the floor near his reading chair and remove them to the utility stairs , he might organize his bills and receipts , opening envelopes and stacking the bills to be paid , he might look to see if any apple cores were where apple cores did n't need to be , in the sink or in an ashtray , he might tuck the quilt tight around his bed , he might push the ashes into hisp198fireplace with the little fireplace broom , he might turn on his answering machine so that he would n't be tempted to answer any calls , he might . . . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do than these finicky household chores , and it was correct . He might hide in a drawer the clippings about Justice Victor Lonkin . He finished and he waited . He did not look out the window or listen for the sound of her motor . He washed his face and he scrubbed his ears with a cloth . Perhaps this was an hour of solitary confinement . She came bustling in with lots on her mind and in her arms , much to accomplish , such as much avoiding of his eyes  --  " Hi , Wat ! "  --  and a paper bag gaily printed with the tricolors . " It 's lunchtime anyway , " she said=anyway what ?  --  " but I was in such a rush , I guess  --  " He stood by to let the whirlwind pass . " Are n't you going to relieve me of my burdens ? You expect me to carry things to the kitchen just as if I remember where the kitchen is , Watkins , in your little hideaway condo ? " In a hurry , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to deliver to a piano lesson , Bethany did not surprisehim with one of her marvelous picnics . Besides children , she had Watkins to manage , and one of her marvelous picnics packed in the French wicker basket would be wrong managementfor this occasion  --  overkill for what she had in mind . Instead , she had stopped at the Gormet Boteek on E Street , which she always called Elm Street , for a couple of Cheese McCamembertsandwiches on McFrenchbread , cole slaw , potato salad , and it came with choice of Offbrand Kola , strawberry pop or V-8 juice or beer at a slight surcharge . She knew enough to get one beer for him , one juice for her . " McHeineken 's , " he said . " Now do n't make fun of me , " she said . " I did n't have to look for snacks at all . I could have made you scramble something . " " This is just like old times , Beth . "  | " These are new times , however . " Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " I 've not forgotten you , Wat . With all my chores , driving hither and yon , I 've had lots of time to think of you . I still squeeze you in mentally . " Bethany can appreciate me , he was thinking , that 's one of her charms for sure . But without necessarily caring for me . Every other woman spends so much energy on being winsome . She does n't worry about it . The other women are suing for love and more love , or they 're hurt and they give it up absolutely , or they 're hurt and this is worse -- twist around like snakes and bite everything in sight , including their own tails . He corrected himself : Every other woman I know . Every other woman I deserve . ( Further correction . ) Linda King , for example , she might even be as smart as Bethany . She just did n't have everything she wanted . She lined things up in a jumble . She got herself in a life jam . Bethany was unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her grasp , and by God , she might have it . For Watkins , on the other hand , it was too late for the latter . " Maybe I 'll have eternal middle age instead . " " What ? Are you mumbling again ? Wat , rinsing off your silver , you do a rotten job on the silver , I ca n't hear you if you mum-ble . " " How come you did n't pick up McPlasticware ? " " This is festive . Life is a festival , Wat , shall we dine ? Feed the beasts their lunch first , then converse or whatever . " Bethany played at tennis even when she was n't playing tennis . It was her uniform , it was how she revealed and concealed herself . She wore country-club tennis whites to do the shopping and to car-pool the children and meet her lover , or she wore tennis colors , or sometimes she wore jean cutoffs , like a girl just hanging out at the high-school courts on a summer 's day . When she wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out which mood called for spearmint , which for **29;9600;TOOLONG . No one objected , though Pinky Stearns glanced at him from time to time with tentatively unfriendly puzzlement . When the bell rang , Mickelsson glanced at his watch , startled . " Thank you for your patience , " he said . " Thank you all for your patience . " He 'd been seated in his office for more than an hour , with the door closed and the light off  --  seated doing nothing and thinking nothing , staring at the wall  --  when a timid knock came . He considered not answering , then thought perhaps it might be Jessica , whose conversation might be a comfort just now , and so he called , rather softly , as if he had n't quite made up his mind , " Come in . " As soon as he saw the worried , uncertain way the doorknob moved , he knew it would be Nugent . " Christ , " he whispered , then leaned forwardonto his left elbow and swivelled around in his chair so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wide , not seeing him at first in the room 's late-afternoon dimness . His black friend  --  Mickelsson had forgotten the name was with him again . He looked in over Nugent 's shoulder , and when he was sure that it was really Mickelsson there at the desk , he smiled and bobbed his head , then backed away , giving them privacy . " Did you want the light out ? " Nugent asked , hovering between the hallway and the office . " It 's fine . My eyes are tired , " Mickelsson said . " Come in if you like . What can I do for you ? " " Thank you . " He advanced a step or two , looking around the room as if to make sure no one waited in ambush . Then , apparently deciding he was safe , he closed the door behind him and came the rest of the way at a more normal pace . " May I sit down ? " he asked . " Be my guest , " Mickelsson said wearily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seated himself , rigid as usual , folding his hands and locking them between his legs . He looked not at Mickelsson but exactly at the point on the wall Mickelsson had been staring at earlier . Mickelsson got out his pipe and tobacco . " I 'm sorry about this morning , " Nugent said . " I realize I wasted valuable class time and talked nothing but stupid nonsense . " His lips trembled and it came to Mickelsson that , damn it all , the boy was going to cry again . In spite of his annoyance  --  the feeling of claustrophobia that came over him every time the boy came near him  --  Mickelsson said , almost gently , " That 's not true . " He concentrated on his pipe , lest the boy throw him a look . " I had n't thought it out , " Nugent said . " I lost my temper , sort of -- -all those things they were saying .... I 'm sort of new at all this . I 'm not a very well-educated person , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels and poetry and things  --  nothing systematic  --  and I 've been pretty good at physics  --  I can tell you why the lifetime of a resonance particle is not necessarily the smallest possible unit of time  --  " He gave a choked laugh . " There I go again . " Mickelsson could feel the boy looking at him now but kept his eyes on the bowl of his pipe , packing it , preparing to light a match . When he did , the flame was surprisingly bright , glaring on the glossy stipple of the wall . " Anyway of course it 's not true that Plato 's method is different fundamentally from Aristotle 's  --  I finally read the Parmenides , as you suggested we should do , and I , I saw  --  " Suddenly he raised his hands to his face , not lowering the face , simply covering it , holding his breath , his red elbows shooting out sharp as knives to either side . " Take it easy , " Mickelsson said , gently but with distaste . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were surprisingly small , and white , as if never touched by sunlight . " Take your time , " Mickelsson said , and sighed . " It 's all right , believe me . " Seeing that the boy was still unable to speak , he said , " Life 's full of troubles , we all find that out eventually , but in due time we live past them . " He got out his pipecleaners , took the pipe from his lips , pulled the stem off and busied himself with cleaning it . " I know you have plenty of troubles of your own , " the boy said , still pushing apology . Mickelsson remembered the boy 's saying , earlier , that he knew how Mickelsson lived , knew everything about him . He thought of asking now what Nugent had meant ; it was never good to leave fingernail parings in the hands of witches , but instead he laughed and said , " Boy , you said it ! " He looked sideways at Nugent , who had taken his hands from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the pipecleaner into his wastebasket , shook his head ruefully , and said , " I 've been trying to deal with the I.R.S. They 're incredible  --  simply incredible ! They spy on me . " He laughed . " No doubt that sounds like the height of paranoia , but it happens to be true . Every now and then they show up in one of those dark , unmarked cars and sit watching me . I suppose it 's some kind of scare tactic . " " You 're sure it 's them ? " Nugent asked , slightly turning , not quite raising his eyes to Mickelsson 's . " Well , pretty sure , " Mickelsson said with a little laugh and relit his pipe . " I had a visit from them , not too long ago  --  came to see me at my apartment . The car they were driving then was pretty much like the one that comes by now . " " What are you going to do ? " It did not seem just polite conversation . NI ickelsson saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugentabout that car . It might he construed as an invitation to friendship , anutule rn-ining of the teacher-student relationship . In the hope of blockingp202that development , he told him more . " Well , " he said , falsely chuckling , " I thought it would be best to deal with the thing directly , so I shot off a note to the I.R.S. office most likely to be responsible , the one in Scranton , since now I 'm living in Pennsylvania . I simply told them I know what they 're up to and asked them to stop . " Nugent thought about it , no doubt privately analyzing , as Mickelsson had done over and over , whether it was a good idea or likely to make things worse . At last he said , just above a whisper , " Creeps . " " They are creeps , " Mickelsson said , pleased to have been given the word for them . Now a silence fell between Mickelsson and the boy . It was Nugent who finally broke it . " Well , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry  --  and I 'm sorry about making a scene here now , too . It 's been a  --  " He stiffened slightly , making sure he had control . " It 's been a bad year . " Mickelsson studied him . Nietzsche would say  --  or Freud , or any other man of sense  --  that the statement was an emotional con . He drew the pipe from his mouth and , against his better judgment , said , " I heard about your father . I 'm sorry , Nugent . " The boy nodded . After a moment he said , " I also had a friend die , my chemistry teacher  --  he was murdered ; you probably heard about it , maybe I told you . Professor Warren ? He 'd just gotten married a week before  --  " A chill ran up Mickelsson 's spine . Warren . That was it , of course : the strange , bedevilled woman he 'd met at the Blicksteins ' party . Evenly , he asked , " Was n't he investigating something down near where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about that , " Nugent said . He closed one hand over his nose , breathing shallowly again , fighting emotion . " He was always looking into something or other . He had more energy than  --  " He fell silent and tightly closed his eyes . In a minute he would whisper again , " I 'm sorry , " and would cry . To prevent it , Mickelsson said sternly , " It 's been a bad year for you , Nugent . I 'm very sorry . " " Well , " Nugent said , and sniffled . Abruptly he stood up . " Thank you , " he said , for an instant meeting Mickelsson 's gaze . " No problem , " Mickelsson said , and waved his pipe . " Any time I can be of help ... " Nugent nodded stiffly , then turned , off balance , and hurried to the door . He fumbled for the doorknob as if unable to see it , then opened the door , half turned back , nodded stiffly again , then quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Mickelsson sat for a few minutes longer it- the now quite dark office , thinking , or trying to think . A chemist . Then at last he heaved his bulk out of the chair , dropped the tol-atco pout l- and pipe into his 1xK i:ct , and settled his spirit on the long , lonely drive home.  |p203Now  that the leaves had turned , exploding in a variety of yellows and reds here and there broken by the dark green pines , the Susquehanna Valley and the mountains rising on each side of it were more beautiful than ever . In farmers ' yards lay piles of bright orange pumpkins , and on every roadside stand , from Binghamton to Susquehanna , Mickelsson saw more of them  --  also apples , bright yellow pears , plastic jugs of cider . Here and there , seated on a porch or up on the gable of an old , gray barn , sometimes on a porch roof or sleeping against a tree , he saw pumpkin people  --  brightly dressed , straw-filled characters with jack-o ' - lantern heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountain roads , pausing now and then to spill out tourists with cameras . Often they stopped outside Mickelsson 's house , to take pictures of the pond and waterfall , the viaduct and river in the distance . Mickelsson kept clear of them , more reserved than any native . ( He 'd seen no sign , lately , of the dark green , unornamented car that had earlier come to spy on him . ) Every night , deer came to look down at his house . Mornings , the grass would be white with frost . Halloween came and went . He might easily have forgotten about Halloween  --  he 'd lost all track of time , floating in it as in Nietzsche 's sea of recurrence . If there were masks in store windows , Mickelsson did n't notice them . But two nights before the real one  --  if he was n't mistaken about the date of Halloween ( it had always been Ellen who tended to such things )  --  Mickelsson , driving through Susquehanna after dark , came suddenly on a troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white-sheeted ghosts . They scattered away in all directions from the glow of the headlights . Hastily , Mickelsson laid in candy and apples , preparing for the blackmail of trick-or-treat , and just to be on the safe side padlocked the barn in which the old blue Chevy sat  --  in his country childhood , Halloween had been a favorite time for vandalism , especially the destruction of seemingly useless machinery . Then he waited , busying himself around the house and listening for a knock . His head was crowded with painful , happy memories- - scenes , images , fragments . Their first year at Brown , he and his family had been invited to a I Ialloween party given by some friends , the Vicos  --  the adults to drink , eat , and talk , the children to go out trick-or treating together , maybe tell , fifteen kids . Marla Vieo , famous for her sewing ( she 'd later turned pro/fessional , opening a store ) , had " created " something for his daughter Leslie ; none of them except Leslie had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at that time of her life but overalls , some old workshirt , and a baseball cap , her long blond hair stringy , always slightly tangled , usually ( like her face and hands ) not quite clean . Her greatest happiness was to visit her grandparents ' farm in Wisconsin , often with a girlfriend , sometimes with her brother , who liked it less , and devote herself to fishing , pigs , and horses . He and Ellen had not strongly disapproved of her ways ; even if they had , nothing much could have been done about her . She 'd been as stubborn and independent as she was winsome . So they 'd arrived that night at the Vicos ' steep-roofed , ultra-modern house with its lush plants , mysterious lighting , and invisible stereo , Leslie in her usual country-hippy garb , and after a few minutes Marla had gone off with the girls of the children 's party to the master bedroom . Joe , Marla 's husband , took the boys . When the girls emerged , with much fanfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly , on Leslie , knowing her at once and , in a way , not knowing her at all . The room had been filled to the brim with noise  --  ooh 's and ah 's , exclamationsand cries of laughter  --  but he had felt as if he and Leslie were standing in a great silence . Marla had dressed her as a fairy princess : silver crown , light blue dress nearly floor-length , large transparent wings that seemed lighter than air . Her hair , around the eye-mask , was brushed and shimmering , lighter than the wings , and her face had been subtly colored , so that she looked a little like a doll , or a Sumerian goddess . He stood motionless , baffled as by a psychic vision , and he was not himself until his daughter came to him , obscurely smiling , and , raising her star-tipped silver wand , lightly  --  impishly  --  touched him with it on the nose . He stood grinning , dazed . Then the boys came tumbling out from the second bedroom , Joe Vico behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys , a portly banker with a Godzilla mask , then Mark , his son , dressed as some formal , scientific-looking man , bald , with a long white beard and a kind of scarf draped flat over his shoulders . Though there could n't have been more than six boys in all , they roared like school letting out . Mickelsson , abruptly coming to himself , had joined in with the laughter and extravagant but not inaccurate praise . Then , before his heart was ready , the children were off trick-or-treating . Everything he 'd seen , smelled , touched that night was alive , unforgettable , transmuted by his vision of Leslie . Marla had made some kind of fish in aspic ; other women , including Ellen , had brought other things . There was a black chocolate cake with whipped cream and cherries ; a large fruit salad that made a picture of ' a witch . l le looked at everything with reawakened vision , the innocent eyes of a child . For all his love of talk  --  especially his own talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the conversation and had taken no teal part in it . In his mindp205he saw his daughter approaching strange doors : such beauty as the man in the doorway 's glow had never seen before , beauty that might reasonablyturn him at once from a furniture salesman or professor of economics into a kidnapper or rapist . Little comfort that the party was led by Olympia Vico , sixteen , and guarded on all sides by sixteen- , fifteen- , and fourteen-year-olds . Everyone in the room where Mickelsson sat was talking of Marla 's genius with needle and thread . Mickelsson kept stroking the fern beside him as if he thought it were a dog , often nervously glancing at his watch , and at last he 'd said casually , " I think I 'll just drive around and see how the kids are doing . " No one seemed to notice the oddity of the remark . No one seemed worried in the least about the children . He drove up and down street after street and saw no trace of them . His heart began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen children all at once and leave no sign outside his door . Then at last he spotted them and at once pulled the car over to the curb and extinguished the lights . His son was bowing grandly , swinging down his top-hat to reveal the pink cloth bald dome , and the man and woman at the door were laughing . His son was obviously the star , the leader . His daughter was nearly at the back of the flock , just another child in dress-up . She was smiling and slapping the hand of the girl beside her as Mickelsson had seen black people do on TV . When he returned to the party , one of the men from the Art Departmentwas doing a sword-dance , and Marla Vico was flamboyantly playing the piano . Mickelsson thought her beautiful . Then he noticed that all the women in the room were beautiful . Let the demon of eternal recurrencecome speak to him now ! He remembered other Halloweens , at Hiram , in California , the sad one in Heidelberg where they could n't find masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken it in stride ) . He remembered the Halloweens in graduate school , when they were poor ; how they 'd watched the glass dish of M &M's; beside the door , praying they would n't give out .... Suddenly he remembered , only for a moment , a rather different occasion . He was n't certain how old he 'd been . Nine , maybe . And he was no longer clear on exactly what had led up to it . He was in fourth grade . His teacher was Miss Minton . He hated her as he 'd never hated anyone before or since . For some reason she 'd sent him to the coatroom , or rather , led him there by the ear  --  a particularly grisly punishment because no one after second grade was ever sent to the coatroom . ( He understood it now . Proper form would have been to send him to the principal , but Miss Minton was notoriously cruel , maybe crazy ; the principal would not have supported her , or anyway not to her satisfaction . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her : " Sssmart , are n't you ! Ohp206yess , you 're sssmart ! " Her lips shook , a hairy , warty lump on the upper one . She was a stupid woman ( so Mickelsson had believed ) , and no doubt , overgrown and stubborn as he was , and a smart-aleck besides , he had challenged her more than he knew . He remembered , though he could n't recall details , that he 'd mocked her , made fun of her , mimicked her ; and he knew that the wilder she became the more stubborn and despairingly reckless he grew . No one quite believed him about her or , so far as he knew , took his side . It was no trifling business . Once when he had had his desktop open and was munging around inside for a book , she , passing down the aisle , had slammed the desktop down on his forearms with all her angry might . When the school nurse came  --  Miss Minton could n't prevent it  --  the nurse found his left arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and tended to believe now  --  that he 'd given his teacher no provocation . In any case she 'd lied , or tried to , saying he 'd fallen while running  --  wicked child in the classroom . Much as all the children feared her , someone had told on her , and at last , bitterly weeping , blaming Mickelsson , Miss Minton had admitted what she 'd done . When he 'd complained , theatrically crying , to his parents , faking more pain inside the cast than he felt , they 'd insisted that he must have done something very wrong  --  " There 's two sides to every story , " his father said , not ungently but with finality  --  and the principal had pretended to hold the same opinion . ( She 'd been as kind as she was able to be . The principal had suggested , in subtle ways , that if he endured through this year he would next year have Mrs. Wheat , who would make up for it all  --  which in fact had proved true . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard that the fingers would sting for minutes  --  if you said " Hell-o-copter " instead of " helio-co-peter . " She would also hit you with the ruler if you said " stuff , " as in " books ' n ' stuff "  --  " except when you 're talking about Thanksgiving , " she said . ( " That 's not stuff , ' that 's stuffing , " Mickelsson had said scornfully . She 'd hit him with the ruler . ) She also hit you for reading " David Cooperfield , " as she called it . Why it was wrong to read David Copperfield she did not explain ; perhaps because he read it through arithmetic class  --  but he loved arithmetic and had finished and handed in all the book 's exercises weeks ago . Pretty clearly her madness had in it , among other things , something twistedly sexual . When she 'd finally admittedslamming the desktop on his forearms , she explained to the principalthat she 'd done it because he was " playing with himself . " No one questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme  --  as extreme as his small-boy prudery and shyness . Miss Minton was not pretty . She was thin as a rail from the collarhoneup and from the knees clown , and a blimp between . She had such warts as would not be tolerated in the work of a painter who claimed to be realistic , and front half the tvatts , as from the rest of her hexly , carnep207soft moss . Her hair was black , her face chalky white except for artificial colors here and there . She was unpleasant in every way , and when later that same year she had died of a brain tumor , Mickelsson had not been as sorry or forgiving as he 'd pretended . And so , locked in the coatroom that afternoon , Mickelsson , still with his arm in a cast , had begun to look through the art supplies  --  mainly white paste and construction paper , brushes and dried-up tempera  --  then look ( not for the purpose of stealing ) through the other children 's coats . Eventually , in the broomcloset , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hat , umbrella , and purse . In the purse he found her make-up . When Miss Minton opened the coatroom door at four o'clock  --  he had never fully intended this to happen  --  she met a creature wearing her own coat , hat , and boots , a face painted to look as if it had horribly shattered , splashing blood . That was not the worst . In the creature 's right arm , Miss Minton 's umbrella was raised like an axe . It came down on her . She would remember nothing more for several hours . Nov all the children began to scream . He chased them with the umbrella , screaming back at them , terrified , trying to make them stop . It seemed the whole world was in reeling , finny commotion , flopping end over end . And then the black janitor , Mr. Pierce , was holding him in his arms , talking to him quietly and squeezing the air out of him . Miss Minton , laid out flatlings with her face turned toward him , over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out between her parted lips made no sense . No one had knocked yet at Mickelsson 's door . He decided to sit down in the front room with a book , to make doubly sure he did n't miss them when they came . The clean lines and colors of the candy and apples weighed on his spirit . Still no knock , no laughter in the yard . He was too far out in the sticks , perhaps . No one even crept up to soap his windows . Was it possible that Halloween was last week ? Next week ? In the end he put the candy away in plastic bags in his refrigerator . For days after that , he ate apples from the bowl in his livingroom or from his pockets . He 'd been driving to the university , during this period , no more often than he had to , and avoiding people , as well as possible , when he was there . Occasionally he broke this pattern , always to his later grief . Once , travelling down a hallway he seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw someone he recognized , a young man he 'd met at a party somewhere and had enjoyed talking to  --  they 'd talked about foot hall . Ile glanced at the mane on the door  --  Levinson  --  then waved and c ailed in , " Iii there ! 1 low 's it going ? " The young matt turned his head , looking startled , then pleased to see him . " IIi ! " he said . " ' Terrible ! " Ile laughed , but the left side of his lipp208jerked up , forming a sneer not meant for Mickelsson but for the world . He was wearing one of those Greek off-white sweaters  --  more off-white just now than it ought to be , slightly ragged at the cuffs and too short . " What 's wrong ? " Mickelsson asked seriously , at once genuinely concernedand sorry that he 'd stopped . " Ahgh , nothing , " Levinson said , regretting that he had n't answered , Fine , just fine ! He raised a hand to his curly , dark hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been writing with up behind his ear , like a grocery clerk . " I 'm getting killed , these gas prices . I 've been here eleven years as an associate professor , and all I 'm making is twenty-one . " Again his lip lifted in the involuntary sneer . " My son 's in Boston , with his mother . It was a bitter divorce  --  very painful . I really love him . " His eyes flicked angrily away from Mickelsson 's . " I drive up and see him every two or three weeks . " " Jesus , I 'm sorry , " Mickelsson said . Levinson shrugged , an exaggerated heave of the shoulders . " Fucking oil companies . Reagan as President , it 'll be a whole lot worse . " " He has n't really got much chance , has he ? " Mickelsson asked . " Do n't kid yourself ! " The sneer-tic grabbed fiercely this time . His eyes roved the room . " They should 've been socialized twenty years ago . Oil companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . " Now Mickelssonremembered who Levinson was : one of Jessica 's Marxist colleagues in sociology . He felt a brief impulse of coolness toward the man , then lost it . Levinson looked like a college freshman , but battered , permanentlyinjured . His Jewish nose was so hooked it looked broken in the ring . " I had a dry spell for a while . Jesus , it drove me crazy . " " I know how that feels , " Mickelsson said , raising his hand to the doorframe . " Working on Nietzsche , " the young man said . " It 's something that might interest you . I 'd be glad to let you see it , maybe get a few comments , when I get the thing in shape . " " Ah ? " Mickelsson said , both interested and reserved . " I 've been working on pain "  --  he sneered and smiled at once  --  " how to put it to work for you . Nietzsche was on to it as early as The Birth of Tragedy . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , that 's true . " " The sublime as the artistic conquest of the horrible . " Mickelsson nodded . " You think you 'd be willing to look at it ? " The young man 's eyes settled on him only for an instant , then roved again . " Sure I would , " Mickelsson said . " Of course ! " It was a point at which he might easily take his leave , but he rentainecl , for I.evinson 's sake , not for his lnsn . " I 've never known exactly what I think about that particular doctrine , " he said . " Problem of ' Physician , heal thyself. ' "  |p209Levinson  drew the pencil from behind his ear , as if unconsciously considering writing down some note on the lined white pad on the desk in front of him . " What do you mean ? " he asked . " Oh , you know . The whole question of sublimation . ' Freud 's kind , that 's easy ; but Nietzsche 's , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went any further he 'd be there all afternoon . " Well , anyway , " he said , " good luck . " " Thanks , " Levinson said . Then : " You mean you think it 's possible ? " Mickelsson smiled . " God knows I hope it 's possible . " The young man thought about it , then said , lifting one eyebrow , " Good hick . " Every spare minute he could find , all through October , he had worked on his would-be blockbuster book , the book he 'd begun with such joy and confidence in the first radiance of his infatuation with Donnie Matthews , but which seemed to him now , like the costly , difficult affair itself , sometimesunbalanced , never really sensible , though at moments as glorious as the autumn weather , the sweet smell of change in Donnie 's hair and breath . At his worst moments he found the project , like the love affair , embarrassing , enslaving , and insipid . When he was unable to write , he worked  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had reason enough for gloom . His son was still missing ; and it had been weeks since he 'd sent money to his ex-wife and daughter , though he 'd caught Ellen up on her house and car payments . When he glanced through his mail , usually without opening it , at least half of it consisted of letters from collection agencies . The Acme would no longer take checks from him  --  he 'd bounced there repeatedly  --  and even Owen Thomas looked ill-used whenever Mickelsson got out his checkbook , though Thomas did still take his checks , accepted them almost graciously , all things considered , perhaps from kindheartedness or timidity , perhaps because of the large amount of business Mickelsson did at Owen 's store . Winter would be trouble , when he had to pay for fuel oil , more wood , and the various extras that inevitably settled in with cold weather . The automatic transmission in the Jeep was behaving oddly , noisily clunking whenever he shifted into drive ; some lawyer in Providence was threatening to site him for fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason refused to pay three years ago ; and Mickelsson was no closer than ever to paying off the I.R.S.  --  the fines and penalties mounted daily : fourteen thousand a year was about what they 'd come to ; so Finney claimed . I le had , in short , reason enough to he discouraged . At times he angrily whistled the whole thing clone with , wished some supernal referee would blow a whistle and declare hits out , bankrupt . But he was beginning to learn , that linane ial ruin , Tike death , is not a moment but ap210process , a slow , merciless grinding down . Sometimes not even an expert could say , in a given case , that ruin has now come , or ruin , though close at hand , has not yet arrived . He sent away for , and obtained by means of lies , a Master Charge card , which meant that his checking account would be guaranteed up to three thousand dollars . He also received , in spite of his execrable credit , an American Express card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit at all . The news that this was so  --  news Mickelsson got through a joking phonecall from Finney  --  filled Mickelssonwith righteous indignation , a sentiment Finney did not share . " Prods her ass one step closer to the courthouse , ole pal , " Finney said . " Look at it this way , ole pal ole sock : you did n't make the world , so mafriend you 're Not Guilty . Whatever falls in your yard , put your fucking flag on it ! " Though he had always despised Jake Finney 's worldview , and suspectedthat even Finney himself despised it  --  exactly the worldview of Martin Luther , but with no otherworldly alternative  --  he could not deny , in those moments when he allowed himself sober reflection , that he 'd already adopted it in practice . His chief personal expense these days , greater even than the expense of his house , was a seventeen-year-old prostitute . Sometimes late at night , especially when he was drunk , he thought about the money he 'd seen in the apartment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go through in his mind how one might run three hard steps from across the hallway and smash the tall door in , sometime when the fat man was down on the street , then rush over to the chest beside the fat man 's TV chair , gather up the money and be gone , all in less than a minute . He envisioned it so clearly it might have been a memory floating up out of the gumbo at the bottom of his mind . Then , realizing what he was thinking , half seriously toying with , he would shudder like a sick man and whisper , " Stupid ! " or , sometimes , " Insane ! " When he was in downtown Susquehanna he would catch himselfgazing thoughtfully up and down the street , seeing if the fat man was out . He never was . Sometimes , going up the dark , narrow stairway to Donnie 's room , his coat collar turned up , his hat flat on his head like an Indian 's , he would pause , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . She no longer charged him seventy-five dollars a visit . She 'd grown somewhat fond of him  --  or so he hoped , since his heart was slaughtered by just the rustle of her dress , the little joking pout she put on when he lost his erection , or the way that , making a face , she would cross her eyes . But she was , she insisted , a professional , and would not " put out " for less than twenty dollars , or spend the whole ( light with him for under sixty . ( She would not accept checks . ) Before Donnie , he 'd never visited a prostitute , neither slid he  --  any longer know anyone who slid , so lie had no way of telling whether or not she was cheating him . She probably was ,  |p211he  supposed , but he was afraid to press . Once when he cautiously touched on his suspicion that the price was exorbitant , she said , " Why do n't you check with the police ? " She knew him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on them some evening or afternoon ( which somehowseemed worse ) made him sick with dread . When he was teaching classes , the approach of that thought would make everything he was saying fly at once from his mind . He would imagine dire headlines : UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR HELD FOR CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF MINOR . PHILOSOPHER CAUGHT WITH SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL . He would rack his brain , standing there empty-headed in front of his class , too sick at heart even to remember to take a Di-Gel . Sometimes he could do nothing to get his wits back but go over to the window and stand for a few minutes rubbing his forehead and staring out . His fear of the police and his distress at how much his addiction was costing him were by no means the only griefs she gave him . He worried about disease . He thought of poor syphilitic Nietzsche , who in 1889 had run into a street to throw his arms around the neck of a horse as its master , like some brute from Dostoevski , was beating it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never again sane  --  the best mind in Europe reduced in one instant of passionate sympathy ( " I am not a man , I am dynamite " ) to rubble , one at last with Jesus of Nazareth as Nietzsche had understood him  --  Jesus the " idiot . " No one went mad from syphilis anymore , of course , or so Mickelsson believed . Nonetheless , he knew that Donnie Matthews was n't careful , and some of the people with whom she dealt looked  --  to say the least  --  unhealthy . He worried as much about her as about himself and could n't help furtively checking up on her at times  --  rather frequently , in fact  --  finding reasons to loiter in front of Reddon 's Drugstore , as if waiting for a prescription , or chatting with Owen Thomas on the sidewalk in front of his hardware store , conveniently nearby . He could n't bring himself to go sit on her landing  --  she might get angry , and her anger was a terrible think but he knew by now all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well tell who her customerswere . ( Sometimes he would say , unable to help himself , " You 're a hard worker , I 'll grant you that . Five this afternoon ? " She would roll her eyes . ) They were a ghastly company , Donnie Matthews ' clientele , not just filthy , scarred , pimply , but downright deformed . Get them all together in one room , it would look like a Fellini cast party . " Mostly the good-looking people do n't need me , " she said with a little shrug when he mentioned it . " Everybody puts out , these days . You ai n't heard of the Pill ? NI y people , they 're naturally the desperate ones . Love for the unloved . " She smirked . " 1 should get that printed on a card . " " The Mother Seaton of the elcnti-monde , " he said . Donnie looked uneasy , as she always did when he used unfamiliar " I " ' ' ssiot-s.  |p212He  said , " How can you do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a year , I 'll bet , and a week 's growth of whiskers , and  --  " She laughed . " I know . That fucking thing in his eye . " He rolled toward her . " Well , how can you ? " " A person has to get ahead , " she said . " That 's the American Way . " She pursed her lips , looking at him . Gently , coyly , she poked his nose with one finger . The gesture filled him with an almost sickening , guilty desire . " You 're jealous , " she said . " God knows ! " Mickelsson said , and took her hand . The house , in any case , was beginning to be beautiful , and he was thankful for its demands , since , to some extent at least , work on the house , besides toughening him up , kept him from making a fool of himselfdowntown . The newly painted and wallpapered rooms , though for the most part still empty of furniture , gave the place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day outside was dark , as days in the Endless Mountains often were . He 'd found junk light fixtures , which he 'd patched and polished and fitted with clearglass bulbs . The brighter and trimmer the house became , needless to say , the more absurd the legends of its haunting seemed  --  legends still obscure , since while everyone in Susquehanna claimed to know the place haunted , no one so far had been able to tell him any more than old Pearson about who might be haunting it or why . Some thought it was the Sprague ghosts who troubled the place ; some thought it was the ghosts of the people who 'd lived there before the Spragues . The U.P.S . man , when he came by with the fruit trees Mickelssonhad ordered , claimed he 'd heard an entirely different story , one no longer very clear in his head but given to him on the best authority  --  something about buried treasure , or perhaps a mysterious grave . . . a curse , possibly . . . . " Well , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his work , which was , that day , the sanding of the downstairsfloors . He must put the whole stupid haunting legend out of his mind . He could not entirely drive from his consciousness the strangeness of what he was doing , fixing the place up when he had no one but himself to do it for ; but he carefully kept himself from thinking too much about that . Even more studiously he kept himself from thinking about his son . Ellen had had a card from him , from Rochester , New York . She had the police out hunting him . Mickelsson received a letter from his daughter  --  a long , chatty one that he read over and over until he knew it by heart , and between readings , kept on his pile of manuscripts on the table in his study . Though the letter was in English , only a few hints here and there of her increasinginclination to shift to Ercnch , it seemed to Mickelsson that she spoke to hint already in a foreign tongue . The letter seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thought but mirrors , maybe rapidly moving mirrors made of steel . Strain as he might , he could n't hear the sound of her voice in the writing whether it was the letter 's fault or his own , he could n't tell . He would stand by the curtainless window of his study , holding the letter in his two hands , reading through it slowly , word by word , as if he were brain-damaged , and though a thousand thoughts pressed through his mind  --  dream-thoughts crowding like shadowydeer through a meadow at night  --  none would stand plain . She assured him that Mark was all right ; he knew what he was doing if anyonedid in this crazy , fiche world . Then she spoke of a young man named David as if Mickelsson should know him ; spoke of her new doctor , a chiropractor and nutritionist , and of the theory of chiropractic : electrical circuits , stimulation of weak organs . He , Mickelsson , should take vitamins , she said , especially vitamin E , for the heart . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosages . " Well , Papa , bon soir , " she ended . " Kaisers ... " At last , thoughtfully , he would fold the letter and put it back on its place on his study table , then move as if aimlessly , to the kitchen , to put on another pot of coffee . While the percolator snorted and rumbled , he would stand at the back door , his hands in his pockets , looking up at the colorful , thinning leaves , thinking calmly  --  coldly and indifferently , as if it had nothing to do with himself or his son  --  how queer it was that the soul in isolation , no matter what the stimulation of the world around , should shrivel up , like a plant perfectly healthy except for its signal leaf , and die . It was no queerer , of course , than the familiar fact that to a person in love the world , however drab , comes alive , full of music and soft voices . It was by no means just poetry . As the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages and pages of statistics and charts , one 's very life depended on the sometimes sped-up heartbeat one experiencedwhen close to loved-ones ( also , to some extent , one 's sped-up heartbeatin the presence of those who offend ) . If it was true that people occasionally died while making love , it was far more true that people died for lack of it . Reading through Nugent 's book , case after dreary case of cardiac fatality in the single , the unhappily married , and the divorced , Mickelsson had begun to feel like a man encountering his own obituary . At first it had seemed that Donnie Matthews , costly or not , would prove his salvation , but no such luck : the quite violent heartbeat rise during young people 's sexual coupling , and the moderate heartbeat rise during older people 's coupling , were both found to be beneficial . The sexual coupling of an older man and a younger woman , especially one not his marriage partner , was apparently only a little less deadly than cyanide . In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical demand for love was not just a matter of sex : the heart- whatever the mind 's objections  --  de/manded company , security , trust . By the time Mickelsson was two-thirds of the way through The Broken Heart , he found the chest-pains caused by his anxiety so great that he dared not read further . All he could do was glance hastily at the last few pages to make sure that at the last minute the author did n't take it all back . Alas , he did not . Mickelsson resolved to eat less , drink less , smoke less . Even so , if Dr. James Lynch was right , Mickelsson was a walking dead man . He was over that original anxiety now , for himself at least . He was resigned to the likelihood that he would die soon  --  even morbidly interested . It would solve a good deal . But with every passing day he grew increasingly uneasy about his missing son . It was not , of course , that he thought the boy might be lying hurt somewhere , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though one of Dr. Lynch 's statistics unnerved him : four out of five of those who die between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five die by accidents , suicide , or homicide ) . Yet he could n't help but worry  --  indeed , Peter Mickelsson was worried sickaboutthe long-range effects of the boy 's decision to go underground . Not the danger that he might be caught for something , and imprisoned , or shot ; these things , though he thought of them , had not yet impressed themselves on Mickelsson as real possibilities . He worried that Mark 's heart , like his own  --  but far nobler than his own  --  might be broken . He shook his head , raising his hand to his chin , touching the stubble of whiskers . Perhaps things were not as dark as he imagined . What if it was the influence of some young woman that had made Mark disappear ? Some beautiful , flashing-eyed , nutty radical . Let it be that , he thought . He almost came to believe it ; it made the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom remained , deep and sodden . A flock of birds floated high over the trees on the mountain above him , drifting like specks of ash . There was , sometime during this period , a queer piece of news in the Binghamton paper . Early in the morning someone had discovered , less than thirty miles from where Mickelsson lived , three perfect circles , each a hundred yards wide exactly , cut into the forest just off Route 17 . Within the circles , trees , wildlife  --  whatever had been there , apparently  --  had been ground to bits . Federal investigators called in to study the strange phenomenon , the article said , had ruled out wind damage , flood , and human vandalism . Asked if they thought the circles had been made by UFOs , the investigators said , according to the paper , that that seemed at present the only available explanation . Mickelsson reread the sentence . That was , sure enough , what it said . ' The article mentioned that similar circles had been found in the same area two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers and read the whole thing again , expecting that this time lw would surely litul it was a joke of some kind ;  |p215but  it was apparently not a joke , at least in the mind of the newspaper people . Strange business ! The following day when he went in to teach , Mickelsson waited for someone to mention the peculiar article  --  more and more peculiar , as he thought about it : though they 'd treated the story as front-page news , the news people had n't even bothered to print a picture . Surely in a case as bizarre as this , a couple of aerial photographs . . . To his surprise , no one said a word about the article until Mickelsson himself brought it up ; and even then , as it seemed to him , they showed only the feeblest interest . Fred Rogers , the historian , when Mickelsson met him just outside the mailroom , smiled as if bravely withstanding life 's woe , sadly amused by Mickelsson 's concern . " We get a lot of that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , apparently . I guess you 're familiar with the Port Crane Center for the Study of UFOs ? " He flipped tragically through his envelopes , sorting as he spoke . " You 're kidding , " Mickelsson said . Rogers glanced at him for an instant , then back at his mail . " No , " he said , as if seeing no reason anyone should think he might ever be anything but serious . " You have n't seen the trucks ? I imagine you 'll see one , sooner or later , tooling down the highway . Port Crane 's not far from here , up on Route 88 . They 're beautiful things , those trucks  --  enough to make you want to study UFOs yourself . Big vans , very official-looking . Sign on the door , siren , red flashers , radar dish on top , computers inside . .. " Suddenly , woefully , Rogers laughed . " Peter , you should see your face , " he said . " I 'm sorry , " Mickelsson said , and made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never  --  " " Yes , " Rogers said , glancing down the hallway , preparing to move on , " it 's curious , all this . Well , there are lots of strange things in this old world . Falls , ' for instance . That 's the one I like  --  frogs falling out of the sky , or blood , or fish . . . stones . . . . Most people say it 's hogwash , but nobody says that after they 've seen one . " Mickelsson lifted an eyebrow , not quite willing to ask the question . " Oh , sure , " Rogers said , shaking his head and patting his pile of mail as if the proof were right there . " I saw the fall of little stones out in Chico , California  --  maybe you read about it ; it made a lot of the papers . I was there the second day . Right out of a clear blue sky , ' as the saying goes . It was most peculiar , believe me . Made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state police , newspaper reporters . We just stood there with our hands folded and looked . Even in Chico nobody believed it except the people who were right there and saw it . Poured clown out of the sky as if there were somebody up there with a dumptruck , except not that fast and not that steady , sometimes nothing for a while , then one or two stones , then bm ketfuls . The way they hit thep216ground they seemed electrically charged or something  --  blurry , as if with heatwaves . Very odd , but then when they 'd settled they just lay there , commonest stones in the world . People make up theories , but they never explain anything . Waterspouts , for instance . But nobody tells you how the stones pulled out of the ocean by waterspouts get carried along in the sky to a place as far inland as Chico , or how come the stones are invariably the local kind , different from even the stones you 'd find forty miles away . " Rogers smiled and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know . You 'd be surprised , though , how many thoroughly studied cases there are of these mysterious falls  --  though I must say , in these matters study ' seems a little irrelevant . I 'll tell you my favorite one : a fall in St. Louis-I967 , I think . Five and a half tons of cookies in unmarked plastic bags . " He laughed , and Mickelsson risked laughing with him . " Thorough investigation , " Rogers said , " local police , U.S. government , chemists and physicists from Washington University . None of the airlines would admit they 'd lost a cargo of unmarked , plasticbaggedcookies  --  I suppose I would n't either , if I were the guilty airline . But it was pretty clear that it was n't a case for ordinary explanation . All the cookies fell on one man 's property , not so much as a cookiecrumboutside the line . Flattened his garage . " " I must say  --  " Mickelsson began , then floundered . " Obviously it does n't much matter whether you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't seem to have any earthly effect on anything , except possibly on a few people 's mood when the thought dawns on ' em that the universe occasionally kids around . " " You actually believe , then  --  " " As I say , " Rogers said gravely , patting Mickelsson 's arm , excusing himself , " belief 's a luxury . I 'm just a historian . I like to know things really happened , if I can , or really did n't happen , and I analyze what happened or did n't if I can . If I ca n't , I do n't . " He grinned . " Anyway , except to those who think they 've seen these things , it does n't matter nium h unless , of course , taking firm stands on doubtful matters gives a paltic'liar person pleasure . " " I suppose that 's true , " Mickelsson said as Fred Rogers moved away . When he asked Jessica about the UFOs , she shook her head and said in a tone of regret that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mickelsson , no one had mentioned it to her . " Was n't there something like that a couple of years ago ? " she asked . Absently , with a quick , soft gesture , she brushed her hair back . When he told her what the paper had said , she nodded . " Funny . " " Wet I , puzzling , " he said . " Oh , Peter , why worry about it ? " she asked , and smiled . She touched his at m . " I 'll stop , " Ile said , hunching ' his shoulders and tone ping his lists togetherjust under his chin , " as soon as I know it 's safe . "  |p217At  the university bookstore , later that day , his eye chanced to fall of a book displayed on the sale table . Phenomena : A Book of Wonders . Hi very discovery of such a book at just this time  --  he was sure it had n't beet there a week ago  --  seemed to him that moment as strange as the UF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a large book , full of etchings am surprising photographs . He bought it , carried it back to his office , close the door , and guiltily paged through it . Falls , missiles from the uppe regions , strange disappearances , mysterious mutilations , spontaneou human combustions , anomalous fossils , shared visions , human beings tha glowed , phantom music and voices .. . He frowned , surprised at his eagerness to believe . Error is cozvardict  --  Nietzsche . And : The religions have a thirst for foolishness . As if it were a Playboy or Hustler , he put it in the back of his des drawer , where he could look at it more carefully later , taking his timeThe report by the fat woman , Rachel Morris , in his medical ethic class that afternoon , was on abortion . It was reasonable and meticulou She was a better researcher and a clearer thinker than , just from lookin at her , he would have guessed . She efficiently covered the legal and philc sophical history of the subject , then began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupidity , her own ethical analysis . There w2 nothing anywhere in what she 'd said so far that one could nail as wront There were a few cheap shots , for instance a mocking quotation of Bill Graham and a blistering aside on the recent papal directive banning abo Lion for any reason ; but on the whole she followed out her central argt ment , based on the premise that in ethical calculations not all person are of equal worth , with reasonably good sense . Yet as Mickelsson listened , making an occasional note to himself , h felt restless , crotchety . It was not just her style of delivery , though h would admit that that gave him problems . When she 'd come into th windowless room , ahead of nearly all the others , she 'd taken , for the fir , time this semester , the chair at the center of the table , opposite him , an had laid out her things  --  ashtray , cigarettes , notecards , tissues  --  as if i conscious parody of him ; and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-heeled shoes , stockings , a dark blue satiny dress several strands of beads . It was probably because she was nervous , h thought ; yet once the paranoid notion crossed his mind that she w* mocking his own formality , he could not entirely shake it . It was likel ' he knew , that she meant no insult  --  indeed , that she was imitating h style because she admired it , thought it worked . But because he did nc very much like her , really , it was difficult to believe that she felt anythin hilt dislike for him. when the whole class was seated , Pinky Stearns at the far end of tlWolters next to him , the women clustered , as if accidentally , at tIopposite end of the table from the men , Ms. Morris began her report witp218what seemed to Mickelsson a sort of lidded belligerence , smoking hard as she read , lighting and jabbing out cigarettes almost without looking at them , her fleshy mouth overneatly pronouncing every word  --  her nervousnessagain , probably  --  her eyes oddly narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , she had the look of those middle-aged , blond , overdressed and over-made-up Jewish women mocked  --  always to Mickelsson 's confused distress  --  in a thousand movies . Her upper arms were fleshy , pale , and soft , her hands small , dimpled , neat . The way she sucked the cigarette smoke far into her lungs and held it there , only gradually letting it out with her words , made him want to break in on her report and talk to her about cancer . Despite his fear that it might worry her , he avoided looking at her , leaning on his elbow , shading his eyes , staring hard at the paper on the table in front of him , with its few neatly pencilled notes . It was a once-a-week three-hour class with a fifteenminutebreak in the middle . His misery was so great  --  his right hand furtively rubbing his chest  --  he wondered if the class might be the last he ever met . Part of what made him restless was his sense that she was working toward an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its popularity , even present legal dominance , filled him with fury . She began with the claim , legitimate enough , that a mother with four children dependent upon her is of more worth to society , including her husband , than is an unborn foetus ; and she moved , not unreasonably , to a claim that any mature human being , given society 's various kinds of investment , should take priority over a foetus . ( He wondered if she would find it equally easy to argue if she used the words unborn child . ) In general , she seemed fair , even-handed . She was properly annoyed by extreme " feminist " arguments that describe the foetus as a " cannibal " ; she rightly noted the possible implications of a widespread practice of aborting when the foetus is not of the parentally desired sex , among other things the possible consequences of population imbalance ( but she treated the matter too flippantly , he thought : " If present correlations remained constant , a United States with many more males would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more Democratic voters " ) ; and she neatly side-stepped the trap involved in turning all anti-abortionistfeeling into cheap religiosity or male-chauvinist-piggism  --  though she could n't resist those little raps at silly Billy and the Pope . Nevertheless , Mickelsson had to concentrate on not wringing his hands , and , furtively glancing around the room , he saw that he was not alone . At first the battle-lines seemed male vs. female , a condition that would not have surprised him . But on closer inspection he saw that . at least two women were similarly uncomfortable with Ms. Morris 's posit ion - - which finally did indeed turn out to be a defense of abortion on demand , " for the avoidance of the needless humiliation of women , too 1'rc/quently socially disadvantaged young women ; and for the sake of social justice , since only the female must suffer the pain of childbirth and , in our society , the shame of unwed-motherhood . " One of the women who seemed displeased was the short girl , Janet , daughter , Mickelsson suddenlyremembered from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was the tall Polish woman , who stared at the table in what seemed acute distress . He wrote himself a note to bring up , when time for discussion came , Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson . After the break , which was unusually quiet  --  not surprisingly ; abortionwas always a touchy subject , even for those who thought they knew what they thought  --  Pinky Stearns asked , frontally , the first question . " I notice you do n't say anything of murder . " Mickelsson sighed . Ms. Morris was ready for it , of course . She sucked deep on her cigarette , lowering her eyelids ( evilly , one might have said , but it was obviouslynothing but the gesture of one threatened , attacked ) , and said , " To many people capital punishment is murder , or war is murder , just as , to other people , abortion is murder . But we traditionally make a distinction between killing by the society and killing by the individual . " A stupid distinction , Mickelsson thought . He thought of Heidegger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending out his praise , however qualified , of the Third Reich . Why not prefer murder by a Raskolnikov ? Not that anarchy was an answer either . Stop everything ! No more painters , no more writers , no more musicians . . . Ms. Morris was saying : " In the case of abortion , of course , it can be argued that the thing killed is not even fully human . " She threw a look at Mickelsson that , in spite of himself , he found touching  --  the uncertain young girl looking out through the eyes of Portnoy 's mother . Hesitantly , like an umpire under duress , he nodded , the curl of his lip no doubt showing his distaste . Stearns fumed but was too stupid , or maybe too angry , to spot the weaknesses in her response . He shook his puffy , filthy-bearded head , an impressive display of disgust and perhaps right feeling , but not an argument . In this much , anyway , Heidegger was right : judging philosophy by the standards of science is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Gail Edelman said softly , looking gently at Ms. Morris , perhaps to avoid looking at Mickelsson , " I suppose one might argue that the problem'spartly one of sped-up modern time . " Her hands made a tent on the table in front of her . Her voice was an almost inaudible tinkle . " As ProfessorMickelsson has often pointed out , morality is based on reality , inchidingour knowledge that our conduct has future implications . " She smiled a weak , frightened little smile , perhaps intending to tell Ms. Morris in advance that eventually she meant to support her position . Gail 's ( lark hair was cut short , her Irish-Jewish features perfect , chinadull-like , beautiful in the way a museum piece is beautiful . Ilcr eyes -- p220black irises , and whites that were faintly blue  --  were astonishing . It had occurred to him , the night of his drunken visit to her , that Helen of Troy might have had such eyes ; they were as striking , in a different way , as Jessica 's . The girl said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are changing with lightning swiftness , as we all know they are , these days  --  when one can not tell what the acceptable and defensible norms are  --  one 's wisest choice may be to argue one 's own life-necessities , since . . . " She looked down , as if troubled by a mental conflict . " Of course the difficulty is that , in acting in a way that seems best for the self , leaving the welfare of the other to the other 's self-defense , that is to say , the future , we may in fact be poisoning our own future self .. .. " She broke off , the outside ends of her eyebrows sinking , as if she were convinced that no one would understand her . No one ever did , no one ever had . She allowed the tent shaped by her two frail hands to collapse . Mickelsson said , though not entirely sure what she was trying to say , " That 's a good description of the problem , I think . " He swept the table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish girl , knotted in front of her , on her notebook . Her tightly pinned hair seemed more frizzy than usual , the lawless ends catching the light , making a kind of halo . He said , " Sometimes , in practice , we 're so hopelessly confused about the total situation we have no choice but to act on self-interest . Which is fine of course , as long as we fully understand what 's in our interest . " He glanced at Janet Something , who , unobtrusively but not timidly , had her hand up . " Janet ? " " I 'd like to know what you think , " she said . " I was watching your face  --  I guess we all were  --  " She glanced around , then back at him , the barest suggestion of a smile touching her lips . " I guess I think everything Rachel said was true "  --  she brushed the hair back from her eyes , quickly , stiffly , almost a karate chop  --  " but I felt something important might be missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed to consider waiting him out , then gave way . " I was thinking of that doctor in one of your articles , " she said , " the pro-abortion doctor who became the head of an abortion clinic which performed , if I remember , sixty thousand abortions without a single maternal death . " " Bernard Nathanson , " he said , and nodded . For the first time he realized that , all this time , watching him , inscrutably smiling , she 'd been an ally . " Go on , " he said . " Well , as you say in your article  --  I guess probably everybody 's read it  --  Nathanson helped get the liberal 1970 New York State Abortion Statute passed , and then suddenly he quit the abortion clinic . " She shrugged . " That 's all I meant to say . " She shrugged again . " I do n't see , " Ms. Morris began , then looked at Mickelsson , betrayed . NI1 kelsson looked dorm at her notecards to avoid her face . " Nathan/son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained in an article for the Neu England Journal of Medicine , was that the foetuses he and his associates vacuum-cleaned out were alive : living human beings , capable of feeling pain , struggling against death  --  every bit as alive as newborn babies . Sixty thousand of them . He never stopped believing in abortion , at least in certain situations . He just stopped performing them . " " But you agree , " Ms. Morris said , her head very still , her dark eyes burning into him , " that an adult female human being is a more meaningfuland socially valuable person than a foetus . " No hardshell Baptist was ever surer of his ground . Her troubled eyes insisted on the irony of it all : that it was Mickelsson 's own position on the inequality of person that underlay her argument . " I mean , " she said , inclining her head toward him , " is n't a grown woman of more value than an unborn thing ? ' He hung fire . " Sometimes , " he said at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolters , looked at Mickels son , not sure what to write in his notebook . " I 'll tell you a funny story , " Mickelsson said suddenly . He let his eye : rest on the tall , thin Polish girl 's hands . " Last spring as I was trimmin  --  the hedges around my house "  --  it was a lie ; in fact it was something he 'd read in a newspaper  --  " I disturbed a bird 's nest  --  a robin 's nest . An egf fell out on the ground , and when I picked it up it felt heavy . For som ( reason  --  I 'm not sure why I cracked it , then opened it up , and beholdwhat I found inside was a tiny , living bird . I was a little upset . I 'm farmboy , I have experience in these things , and I knew there was no wa ' in the world I could keep that little robin alive  --  eyedroppers and al that , if they did anything at all they 'd just prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby bird to be eaten by snakes or to be found by mTneighbor 's cat or dog ; and though I myself felt pity for the thing thiway it opened its bill to me , blindly hoping behind those sealed-shu eyes  --  I knew the mother bird would never accept it , now that it had ET smell on it . So I put it down gently on the ground and put the heel o my shoe on it and crushed it . " Ms. Morris stared . " As I say , " he said , " a funny story . " He opened his hands and raise ( his eyebrows , apologetic . " It was only a bird . " He smiled , then glance ( at the Polish girl , then quickly down . She looked gray . So that was it , fu thought . He 'd walked into it but good , this time . " So you 're against abortion , " Pinky Stearns said sharply , triumphant : aiming his cigar at Mickelsson . " I did n't say that , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw the guilt onto poor Stearns . " I happen to bpro-abortion , within limits . And in the second place , what I think hanothing to do with it . Were talking about ethics , not personal opinions . No one 's mentioned the question of ensoulment " the mousey brow '  |p222haired  girl next to Gail said abruptly , but no one , not even Mickelssonthoughhe heard her  --  noticed . C. J. Wolters said , holding his hand up , palm out , to keep Mickelsson from answering too fast , " What I 'd like to know is , what should we think about abortion , and why ? " No one seemed aware of the misery of the Polish girl . Ms. Morris said , " That 's what my whole report deals with . " A mousey blond girl , whose name he did not know , seated next to the mousey brown-haired girl  --  the blond girl had never before spoken in class  --  said , bored-looking , speaking in a comically flat Midwestern accent , " All Professor Mickelsson 's saying is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A society where people can kill people on demand , ' so they do n't have to go through the embarrassment of explaining why , is a crappy society . " Was her glance at him hostile ? " I suppose that 's it , " Mickelsson said . The tall Polish girl took a slow , deep breath , and still none of them seemed to notice . " Anyway , " he said , " that 's it once we 've added in the individual agony , fear , guilt , anger , and helplessness , the things that make abortion a philosophical issue in the first place . " He suspected that only one of them understood for sure what he was saying . Perhaps " one " not including himself . All truths are for me soaked in blood . In the parking lot he found he had congratulated himself too early on escaping the campus without having to deal with Michael Nugent . As he was getting out his keys , preparing to heave himself up into the Jeep , a voice called out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to see who it was that had spoken , not imagining it was himself who 'd been addressed . Thirty feet away , in the middle of the asphalt between rows of cars , looking at him or maybe past him , he saw a gangly , rather tall , very white-skinned young man wearing white slacks , blue jacket , a broad-brimmed hat canted over one eye . Perched on the top of a dark van nearby , maybe twenty feet beyond the young man in the hat , he saw a graceful , broadly smiling Negro boy . It was only because he recognized the Negro that he recognized Nugent , then an instant later recognized that the words were meant for himself . " What ? " he called . " I do n't know if it had to do with chemistry or not , " the young man called , " but I know he was investigating some kind of fraud . " Mickelsson looked down , gathering his wits , wondering why it was here , on the high parking lot overlooking the campus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugent and his friend had chosen to waylay hint . It seemed strange , to say the least , that Nugent should waitp223for him here , in this isolated place , and then shout his information from thirty feet away . After he 'd mused a moment , Mickelsson put the keys back in his pocket and walked over to Nugent  --  since apparently Nugent did not wish to come to him . The black boy went on smiling , his elbows on his knees , then tipped his head up to look at the sky . Towering black clouds were moving in , drawing together , tumbling . Occasionally one of them would brighten with buried lightning , then go dark again . There was as yet no sound of thunder . The trees above the parking lot were perfectly still . In a moment the smallest branches would begin to move , and after another moment it would begin to rain . Mickelsson 's shadow fell over Nugent . " You mean Professor Warren ? " Mickelsson asked . Nugent blinked rapidly , then nodded . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some people , " Nugent said . It was clear that no amount of prodding would make him more specific . After a while Mickelsson asked , " Something to do with the university , you think ? What was his interest in this fraud ? " Nugent shrugged as if it hardly mattered to him , but his eyes showed interest . They stared straight into Mickelsson 's . Disconcerting . " That 's all you know ? He was investigating some fraud ? " " I guess that 's right . " Now he did hear thunder , a low , long-drawn-out roll that made him think of his grandfather , in those final years , listening as if God 's voice were in the sound . " You think it was just intellectual curiosity ? " he asked . Nugent seemed to ponder the question , then finally said , " He was a clown , in a way . The sort of person who liked to go on  --  you know  --  intellectual benders . I remember he told me he was a member of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned conventional religion  --  he was at Harvard then . Later , when he was teaching at Riverside , in California , he got into Rolfing and the Alexander method  --  I forgot what all . I do n't mean he was stupid , or just a joker , or anything like that . When I say he was a clown ' all I mean is  --  " He stopped smiling and rolled his eyes heavenward , grotesquely , as if saying what he wanted to say , getting it just right , took total concentration and God 's help . " You know how it is in the circus . The acrobat does something , and the clown tries to imitate it , but the clown 's not human , like the acrobat , he 's just this creature with straw in his head . That 's why clowns are at the same time funny and sad : they imitate exactly what human beings do , and if the Niconachean Ethics were right , they really would become human . But no matter what they do they remain just clowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head down , looked at the boy tip from under , reserved . The Mack boy on the vats was still lookingp224up into the darkness of the clouds , watching them with fascination , as if their movement were writing . " I guess I do n't really follow , " Mickelsson said . Nugent gave a quick , eager nod , as if that were completely understandable , exactly as it should be . " I just mean that you have to believe things , to be human  --  you know ? You have to feel that things are true . A clown is someone who 'd give his soul to believe , if he had one , but he never can , he just goes through the motions , harder and harder , to no avail . We laugh at him because we recognize that , in a limited way , that 's how we are too . That 's what I was trying to say in class , about Kafka and the lost language and everything . " Mickelsson thought about it  --  thought , tentatively , hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown , " he said at last  --  vapidly , waiting for something more . Nugent nodded ; two quick jerks . " I did n't understand it at the time  --  and I do n't mean I was wrong to admire him . Gosh no ! When he ' got married . . . I guess you 've probably heard he was homosexual ? " " I had n't , but  --  " He dismissed it with a wave . " But that was typical , you see ! The Truth of Science , Liberal Causes , Marriage and the Family ... " " Mr. Nugent , " he said  --  again the young man 's first name had escaped him  --  " you seem to be telling me that you have no beliefs , you feel like a clown . It seems to me that with a mind like yours  --  an extraordinary mind , if you 'll forgive my saying so  --  " " Mind ! Oh yes , certainly ! " He was smiling , ready to burst out any moment into raucous laughter . " Mind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; this is the absolute proof of God 's existence ! Shall I demon-strate ? " Mickelsson reached out and touched his arm . " You stole that , " he said . Now the leaves were moving , filling the air with a whirring sound . One second ago the trees had been as still as marble . Western light slashed in under the darkness , yellowing the drab brick buildings below , burning the aluminum verticals and windows of the towers . Nugent jerked his arm back . " Nobody wants to be a clown , " he said , " except Emmett Kelly , who was human . " Now the rain began , huge warm drops falling softly and neatly , as if aimed.  |p225That  Friday morning ( all but the oakleaves had fallen now , and the smell of November was distinct in the air , all but the scent of woodsmoke , which would only come with the month itself in Pennsylvania ) , Mickelssonslept late . A little before noon a knock came at the door . He lay waiting for whoever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , changing his mind , he got up , put on his slippers and robe , and hurried down to answer . He was hung over from drinking while he worked on the house , the night before , and his arms , his back , and the backs of his legs ached from pushing too long and hard at his weight-lifting , just before he 'd fallen into bed . As soon as he opened the door he saw that he 'd been mistaken to come down . On his front porch stood two young men , wearing ties and long black coats . Their plain black , carefully polished shoes looked like government-issue , and both young men had their hair cut short , like marines . He clung to his first thought , that they were I.R.S. men , or maybe F.B.I . men come to speak with him of Mark , bring him some news or warning ; but he knew all the while that that was wrong . There was something drab , even pitiful about them . They wore no gloves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red from the cold . Their breath made steam . The blond one said , " Mr. Mickelsson , we 're representing the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints . We understand you recently paid a visit to Salt Lake City " Whatever the young man said next Mickelsson did n't hear . He stared , a confusion of emotions leaping up horror , anger , morbid interest . It was true that he 'd visited Salt Lake City , but it was three or four years ago , an aesthetics conference . How had they found out ? Some student ? Faculty member ? Their network did n't miss a trick , he 'd give them that . Or was it possible that they used the line on everyone , since more often than not whoever they talked to would at one time or another have visited that exalted tourist trap ? If the person they talked to happened not to have been there , no harm : the sober black foot was in the door . 1 ) id they have psychologists working for them , he wondered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insidious advantage of taking the prospect 011 ' guard , addressing hint by name , seeming to know all about hint , past and present ? 1 ) id they have sales pitch classes , con/ferences on seduction , persuasion , intimidation ? It was a shocking idea , but they probably did , he decided . It was the 19805 ; the world was on its last legs , Armageddon close at hand . No time for the messengers of God to be scrupulous or shy . He realized that almost unconsciously he 'd said " Yes , " nodding , admittingthat he had once visited Salt Lake City , yes . Perhaps , the blond one said , he would like to know more about the Mormons . Again Mickelssonfailed to react . He could have told them he knew a good deal about the Mormons . He 'd had a student , some time ago , who 'd broken away from the Mormon Church and had been hounded for months by their soft-spoken , black-suited squads . He 'd had a colleague in California who 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the underwear he 'd been told their women wore , marked with holy gibberishand never taken off , not even in the shower a sin against life , if it was true , he would have told them  --  and once , in a motel somewhere , he 'd read a ways into their incredibly dull bible , the adventures of the archangel Moron . He knew the good that could be claimed for their company  --  their music , mainly ( according to Ellen , it was vastly overrated ) ; also the fact that they were family people , unusually successful in business and agriculture , non-drinkers , non-smokers , statistically more healthy and longer-lived than any other group in America . He would even grant that sometimes , as individuals , they were apparently good people , no real fault but dullness . The daughter of a family of Mormons had been a babysitter for his children when they 'd lived in California . Perhaps these two young men at his door , if Mickelsson got to know them , would seem to him as admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't condemn them for coming to him as missionaries . They all had to do it for a year of their lives , or so he 'd been given to understand  --  always in twos , each for all practical purposes a spy on the other . Indeed , it was possible that they earnestly believed whatever foolishnessit was they came with . Zeal and credulity were common among the young . Ecology , politics , animal rights . . . He thought of Alan Blassenheimand then of his own son , as pale as this pink-lipped young man now explaining to him the desperate condition of humanity  --  speaking not by rote , quite , but not altogether from the heart , either ; prepared to be harshly interrupted and sent on his way . The dark-haired , red-nosed young man beside the blond one stood leaning slightly forward , looking at Mickelsson , listening to his partner with keen interest . " Listen , " Mickelsson said , raising both hands , " I 'm not interested in this . " He might have mentioned the cold they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embarrassed at not inviting them in . Maybe that was why they wore no gloves or hats , part of the strategy worked out iii litah . Eastern States . Zone B. " I Icahn. you 're busy , " the blond one said , and gave him a smile asp227general and mechanical as the smile of an orphan , " but I 'm sure if you could give us just three or four minutes  --  " " I 'm sorry , I really ca n't , " Mickelsson said , and started to close the door . Suddenly the one with black hair spoke up  --  the back-up man , the hard-sell . " Everyone 's busy , " he said and , smiling genially , cut the air with the side of his hand . " If we told you we could teach you a foolproof system for living to be a hundred , that might be different , right ? Or if we told you we could make you a millionaire , no ifs or buts , no tricky fine print , you 'd jump at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost handsome . Mickelsson closed the door a few more inches , but the boy was no fool ; he knew if Mickelsson had really meant to close it he 'd have closed it . " You think I 'm going to tell you that spiritual things are more important than earthly things like health and wealth . That 's what other faiths will tell you . But the way we look at it , the whole thing 's interrelated . You 'll understand what I mean , Professor . Are n't you the author of Survival and Medical Morals ? " The hair on the back of Mickelsson 's neck stirred . The boy went on quickly , smiling hard , no doubt sensing that he 'd set off a wrong reaction , " Survival 's what we 're here to talk about , Professor . " Again he gave the air a slow , sideways chop . With the gesture , his craned-forward head moved like a snake 's . " Is n't it possible that if people live as God intended them to live , they 're likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote you some statistics about the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day  --  " " Wait a minute , " Mickelsson said , feeling his face flush , his right hand closing the lapel of his robe against the cold . " I know the statistics . I know the whole pitch . I already told you I 'm not interested . Now good-day . " The boy blinked , then nodded . After an instant he said , " Thank you . Good-day , sir . " He smiled in a way he apparently intended to seem friendly , but he did n't quite make it . Sour grapes , scornful superiority crept in . The blond one showed relief . " Thank you for your time , sir . " Mickelsson closed the door . The unpleasant aftertaste stayed with him for hours , like the indistinctmemory of a nightmare . It was still at hand , corning over him in occasional flashes , when John Pearson drove up around four that afternoon , with the long-haired black dog in the seat beside him in his pickup . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then closed the door and stood looking at the house . Some kind of object , a forked stick  --  a dowsing rod dangled from his angular right hand . Mickelsson went out to meet him . " I lcllo , " he callctl as the utd man approached.  | " Hod-do , " Pearson said . He gestured to the dog without speaking , and at once it sat down beside the old man 's left boot and stared as if thoughtfullyat Mickelsson . " Fine weather we been having , " Mickelsson said . Pearson seemed to consider the remark , glancing at the sky  --  gray , wintry clouds , yellow western light shooting under them , capping the mountains . " Had a little time on my hands , " he said . " Thought I 'd try to rustle you up that water . " " Good , " Mickelsson said . " Anything I can get you ? " " Gaht it all right here , " he said , and gave an impatient jerk to the dowsing rod . He looked up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , back at Mickelsson . " Everything going all right here ? " " Everything 's been fine , " Mickelsson said . He gestured toward the trash bags , scraps of lumber , and crumbled shards of sheetrock piled more or less neatly near the firewood . " Been trying to fix the place up a little , " he said . He was aware that his smile was less than modest . Anyone who glanced through the windows would be sure he 'd had professionals in . Pearson puckered his gray lips , not quite bothering to nod . Then , pointing to the woodpile : " I guess you know that wood ai n't seasoned . " " Is n't it ? " Mickelsson said . " Burn that stuff in your stove , you 'll wreck your chimley . " He walked over to the wood  --  the dog moved with him  --  and , reaching down with two fingers , twisted off a small branch from one of the logs . " Pure green , " he said . " Two months ago this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't realize , " Mickelsson said . Pearson shook his head as if in wonder , one side of his mouth pulled back . " Better let me bring you down some seasoned , " he said . " Leave this just set here for a year or so . " He glanced at Mickelsson . " I guess you ai n't used to country livin . " He grinned . " Not for a long , long time , anyway , " Mickelsson said . " Wal , " Pearson said . He looked up at the field behind the house again , then down at the dowsing rod , getting ready to start . The dog sat watching him , waiting for some command . Mickelsson asked , " You mind if I come along and watch ? " " Suit yourself , " the old man said . They started up across the yard , past the overgrown garden , toward the field . The old man walked with a look of concentration , his lips pressed together , the dowsing rod straight out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight forward on top of the rod 's two arms . Occasionally the end of the rod dipped , but apparently not to the old man 's satisfaction . He walked with stiff , long steps , as if he were pacing something off . For all his concentration , he seemed to see nothing in the low weeds on the ground ahead of hint but stepped awkwardly on smallp229rocks , sticks , and ant-hills , adjusting his step without noticing . He walked straight across the field , parallel to the road , then , at the stone wall along Mickelsson 's north line , turned and set off at an angle , up toward the woods . At the top of the hill , almost in the woods , he stopped pacing and , after a moment , sat down on a stump to rest . The dog sniffed his boots , then trotted away , darting here and there , keeping them in sight , searching for birds or rabbits . " Seems like the land 's gaht a spell on it , " Pearson said . Mickelsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was joking , but the old man 's face showed nothing , staring out across the brightly painted valley in the direction of the viaduct . It seemed unlikely that he could see that far , with those blurry eyes . The river , under the gray sky , was silver and mirror smooth . Pearson turned his head to look at Mickelsson . " Funny you ai n't seen them ghosts yet . " " I guess I 'm not the type , " Mickelsson said . The old man grinned , then turned away . " Everbody 's the type , " he said . " Most likely you see ' em and do n't notice . " Again Mickelsson said nothing . It was queer , he thought  --  though not all that queer , at Mickelsson 's time of life  --  that in the classroom he stubbornlyresisted ideas that made no sense , ideas half formed , unjustifiable , while here , standing in damp yellow leaves , he accepted John Pearson 's crazy opinions as if nothing could be more obvious or natural . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who no longer existed ? When was the last time he 'd insisted , in class , on his students getting anything right ? Pearson 's thought had drifted elsewhere . " Down there right acrost the road from your house , " he said , pointing , glancing for a moment at Mickelsson to see that he had his attention , " they use to have the Susquehannaice-house . Pond was a whole lot bigger then . Use to skate there , when I was a boy  --  me and all my friends . Used the ice-house to warm up in . They had apples there too , crates and crates of ' em ; keep ' em cold through the winter . Sometimes kept bodies there , for burying in the spring . That was supposed to be a secret . Summertime we 'd bring a bunch of boards and nails and make a diving-board . All that land there growin up in woods use to be pasture then  --  smooth pasture except for some thistles and boulders , right down to the edge of the pond . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cowbarn and a silo right by that pear tree . Maybe you can see the foundation , if your eyesight 's good . Burned down the same night the ice-house did . Drunken kids , likely ; solve of them rascals from up above the woods past my place . That was a long time after the murder and all . People use to come here from miles atownd just to swim in that pond . " Again he glanced at Mickelsson . " Sometimes time brother and sister would set on the porch and watch , though they 'd never talk to you , never said a word , and nobodyp230never said a word to them neither . Strange people , not right in their heads . I guess a little slow . " " Sprague , you said their name was ? " Mickelsson said . " That 's right . Ca n't quite recall their given names . I think the woman 's was somethin Like  --  " He looked at the sky for a moment , then said , as if reading it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some kind of religious name . All them old-timers had religious names . More strange religions in these pahrts than a man could shake a stick at . " " I believe I 'd heard that , " Mickelsson said . He remembered his visitorsand asked , " Are there many Mormons left ? I had a couple drop in on me this morning . " Pearson 's look was rueful . " Not many , but people say they 're comin back . You see a lot more of ' em on the road , these days , and I hear they been dickerin for a big old house in Montrose "  --  he turned his head , one eyebrow raised , to examine Mickelsson  --  " Quackenbush place , up against the church , white house with pillars and a big round porch in front . Back in 1900 it was a bank , they say . Oldest house in Montrose . They wo n't get it . Nobody likes to sell to ' em . " Mickelsson nodded . " I 've seen the place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute he said , " Cryin shame . " When it was clear that he would n't continue unprodded , Mickelsson asked , " About the Mormons , you mean ? " " They 're clubby , " Pearson said , and squinted . " There 's somethin unnaturalabowt people all hangin together like that . The Baptists , now , they may be mean sons of bitches , but there 's no way they 're ever gon na take over the world . Too ornery . Ca n't get along well enough to get organized . Even the Catholics , they do n't really make you nervous . Half the things they do in the world the Pope says they should n't , but they go right ahead and do it anyways . You do n't have to worry about people like that , at least no more'n you 'd worry about a common Presbyterian . But the Mormons , now  --  " He stared at the dowsing rod , lips compressed , trying to come up with exactly what he thought , and at last brought out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to admit that , " Mickelsson said , and grinned . " They live practically forever . " " Yup . " Pearson nodded . He looked out over the valley for a minute , then turned to squint up at Mickelsson again . " You seen those churches the Mormons gaht ? " he asked . " I saw a picture of the one down in Washington , D.C. Big white thing , looks like they built it for one of them science-fiction pictures . Bunch of white spires that go pokiu up like forktines , golden angels on top bloVIII trumpets , I tell you , I do n't think I'dp231care to do business with a God wants a church like that . Wants to scare you and let you know your place  --  right under his boot . Those churches over in Europe , now  --  those cathedrals  --  they 're a whole different thing . They make you think of a God that 's mighty powerful , mighty impressive , but they let you know he 's gaht some human in him ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know English . Same with the Methodistand Presbyterian churches , they let you know God 's gaht his human side ; and the Baptist churches , hell , anybody that can do card-tricks could take over for that God . But the God that thought up the churches of the Mormons "  --  Pearson shook his head as if sorry he had to say it  --  " he must 've come down here from Pluto . " " Well , I imagine the Mormons do a great deal of good in the world , " Mickelsson said , glancing toward the woods . " Sure they do . Same as ants and bees . " He leaned forward and , after a moment , stood up . " I suppose they 're all right , " he said . " Somebody thinks he knows how to get through this world alive , I take off my hat to 'm . " He held out the dowsing rod , adjusting his grip , preparing to march down the mountain . " I take it you 're neither a Mormon nor a Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic or Presbyterian , " he added . Pearson turned to stare at him . " I 'm a witch , " he said . " They did n't tell you that ? " Mickelsson stared , for the hundredth time uncertain whether or not he was having his leg pulled . " I guess I heard there were one or two of those around , " he said , carefully not giving Pearson the satisfaction of a questioning look . Pearson nodded soberly , staring down at the forked stick in his hands . If he 'd been teasing , the mood had now left him . " This country 's seen it all , " he sighed , and slightly shook his head . " I imagine it 's something to do with the darkness , the way the clouds are always there , or if they happen to break for a half a day it 's like a miracle . " He raised his head to look across the valley . " People joke about it having a spell on it , this country , specially fahrm people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it does have , I always thought . Maybe gaht a whole lot of spells on it , layer on layer of ' em , clear back to the time of the Ice Age . Prehistoricanimals , when they were driven owt , put a spell on it ; Indians , when the white people came along , they put a spell on it . Then the Pennsylvania Dutch , then the railroad people , now the Polish and Italian dairy fahrmers ... Course none of the spells do a thing , that 's the truth of it . " Ile narrowed his eyes to slits . " Mountains do n't care , " he said . ' " They 're like a old lean cow , they give you what they can , and if it ai n't enough they let you die and they forget you . Maybe dream you , once in a while , that 's my theory bring you back for a minute , like the Spragues down there . "  | " There 's more life in the place than you 'd think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man 's mood . " Every night around dusk the deer come out , great big herds of ' em . They stand up there grazing almost to the first morning light . " " Yup , " Pearson said , " lotta deer , all right . Bear too , though you 'll never see ' em . Plenty of skunks , too  --  them you will see , owt crawling around your woodpile , lookin for bees and beetles . Coons , possums , thousanddifferent species of birds ... " " Rattlesnakes , " Mickelsson said . " Hob-goblins , " Pearson said . They looked at each other as if reassessing . At last Pearson grinned and looked away . It was dusk when Pearson finally found strong water , or claimed he had , right beside the garden fence . They marked the place with a stake and went into the kitchen to settle up . The dog stood just outside the door looking abused , and in brief consternation Mickelsson wondered if by country manners he should invite the dog in . Immediately he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did with the old man he felt foolish . A problem of the different languages they spoke , no doubt , every word and gesture half foreign . While he was writing the check , Pearson fingered the scraped place on the door . " I see you scratched off the hex sign , " he said . " Yes , " Mickelsson said . " You think it was a bad idea ? " Pearson shrugged . " It 's yore howse now . " He hung his rough hands on the bib of his overalls and looked into the livingroom . " You got a buckled floor , " he said . " I do n't recall seeing that before . " " I 've got to fix that , if I can figure out how , " Mickelsson said . " Accordingto the doc , there 's a spring under the house . " Pearson 's mouth dropped slowly open and he pointed at the floor as if imagining it was he who was having his leg pulled . " You gaht a spring , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I was told , " Mickelsson said . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Pearson said . He pointed toward the kitchen door and the darkness beyond . " You got a spring right there under the floor , and I spent half the afternoon owt there wandering around in the weeds with a stick .... " " Jesus , " Mickelsson said , dawn breaking . Pearson 's eyes widened , and then suddenly both of them were laughing . The old man 's normally gray face darkened and he laughed as if he could barely get his breath . Mickelsson leaned on the refrigerator , shaking . " Jehoshaphat ! " the old man said , clacking his false teeth . Mickelsson bent over . Ile brought out , ' ' Talk about city slickers ! " Lord , I should charge yott triple ! " Pearson roared.  | " I told you I 've been away from the farm a long time ! " Mickelsson said . " Long time is right ! " He drew back now , both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pearson said , " if it was anybody else I 'd say you owed me a drink ! " " Good idea , " Mickelsson said , and , with one more whinny , wiping his eyes , went over to the cupboard for glasses . They drank in the kitchen , Mickelsson unable to figure out whether or not it would be right to invite the old man into the livingroom . " Craziest thing I ever heard of , " the old man said , and they laughed again . Sometime into their second drink , Mickelsson asked , " By the way , how 's your wife ? " " Etta Ruth died , " Pearson said . " Happened three weeks ago Wensdee . " Mickelsson set down his glass . " I 'm sorry . " To his horror he realized that his lips were still smiling . Pearson waved it off , not meeting his eyes , his expression stern . " No need to be . She was sick with that cancer a long time . " Still looking stern , he stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring right under the howse , " he said , " and old John Pearson out there stompin through the weeds ! Lord Jehoshaphat , that 's a good one ! " That night , though he had n't arranged ahead , as she liked for him to do , he went down to see Donnie . When he knocked on her door she called brightly , from a distance , probably the bedroom , " Who is it ? " " It 's me , " he said . When she spoke again the brightness that had been in her voice was gone . " I ca n't come to the door , I 'm taking a bath , " she called . He was almost certain he heard male laughter . He stood motionless for a moment , his head angled toward the door , his right ear almost against the panel . It was odd , these games they 'd begun to play . It was the money , no doubt . To Donnie , he was a goldmine : even if she was n't overcharging him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it visibly annoyed her that old Mickelsson was always there , like God  --  annoyed her that he should spy on her , feel jealous of her , run on and on about his worries concerning her , her seeming lack of all normal connections ( parents , young friends ) , her seeming indifference to the wellknowndangers of her shady profession  --  she played along , ministered to his soul 's prissiness as she would minister , if the profit seemed sufficient , to any other of her customers ' kinks ( he 'd found bite marks on her shoulder one night -- broken skin , ugly swelling , such a mess that he 'd begged her to go sec a doctor , which of course she 'd refused to do ) , so that now , because it was M ickelsson calling to her , she claimed , like some maiden of the suburbs , to he taking a bath . No wonder the pustuled , crooked-toothed , hairy beast beside or on tot , of her laughed ! Shamelessly ,  |p234absurdly  , Mickelsson went along with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you be ? " Murmured consultation . Perhaps they purposely made themselves heard , to mock him , to let him know no one was fooled , neither there in Donnie Matthews ' big , dingy apartment nor anywhere else in Susquehanna . " Make it an hour , " she called . " OK , good , " he said , nodding formally , actually reaching , in the dim , filthy hallway , for the brim of his hat . " Ten o'clock . " He turned , scowlingangrily , gripped the cane by the shank , just below the head , and started down the stairs . The streets of Susquehanna were quiet , unusually empty . After the last few days ' heavy storms  --  rain that had torn away most of the leaves , transforming the mountains from riotous color to the ominous slate gray of high , rolling waves in some sombre Winslow Homer  --  the weather had turned cold , so cold that tonight'bits of ice shone like quartz in the darkness of asphalt and brick underfoot , on the walls of buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , stretching away like a staff without notes toward the dully glowing iron bridge , the perfect blackness of the river below . He turned in that direction , deciding against the tavern up the hill , source of the only sound he could hear in all the town , or the only sound except the dull clunk that reached his ear each time the traffic-signal turned from red to green . People were laughing , back there in the tavern , and the jukebox was playing , so far away , all of it , it might have been sounds from his childhood . At the bridge he turned left , moving toward the unlit , broad , flat span that had once been Susquehanna 's famous depot , engine-repair station , and restaurant . The sign , up above his head , dimly lit by stars  --  COMING SOON ! SUSQUEHANNA PLAZA !  --  was cracked and chipped , getting hard to read , like the rusty old sign one saw on the way in from Highway 81 , VACATION IN THE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS . As he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , made a sudden shift to the stars beyond , the dusty white light of the Milky Way . Something bright , diamond-like , moved slowly across the sky from west to east , maybe an airplane without the usual lights , more likely some Russian or American satellite , Telstar , or whatever : odd that he no longer had any idea what was up there . He remembered he had n't thought of it in years what excitement everyone had felt in the beginning , in the days of Sputnik I and Sputnik II , the martyred dogs , the great American end-over-end flopper : days of miracle !  --  the arrival of Christ in Glory could not have been more astonishing than the passage of those sparks across the heavens , one of them mournfullyblinking on and off . They would stand in their yards , in suburbs and small towns or in the stillness of farm pastures all over America , looking up like sheep , empty hands hanging down beside their pockets ;  |p235here  and there some father with a child in his arms would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timmy ? " or " See , Mark ? See ? " and the child would gaze solemnly at the finger . " The heavens declare the glory of God , " Mickelsson 's grandfather would intone dryly , and Mickelsson 's father would sit beaming in his pew , far more convinced than the old man in the pulpit that it was so , though Mickelsson 's father would not definitely acknowledge God 's existence . " Could be , " he would say , when pressed , " could be . " He believed in cats around the milkcan cover on the cowbarn floor , where he sploshed warm , new milk ; believed in pines  --  he 'd planted thousands of them  --  Canadian geese , slow-swaying Holsteins moving up a lane , heavy old Belgians pulling the log-sled . . . . Sometimes on Sunday afternoons , if Mickelsson had no highschool football game , the whole family would drive to the state hospital to visit his uncle , who 'd gone crazy in the war . " Shell-shock , " the family said , and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time his grandmother said it that for some reason she was not telling the truth . It was not until many years later that he 'd learned what had really happened . " Poor dear , " his mother said , " it 's a shame he could n't have died right there ! What a burden to carry all the rest of your life ! " From the moment they passed through the high iron gates of the hospitalgrounds , nothing was real : time slowed down , shapes took on an extraordinary sharpness and a seeming weightlessness , or every shape but his uncle , who stood in his bathrobe and pajamas , unkempt , hollow-eyed , as firmly centered and infinitely heavy , though small of stature , as some innocent , terrifying image in a nightmare . Though he was thin , his whiskeredflesh sagged on his face ( that was the effect of some drug he had to take , Mickelsson 's father said ) , and his hair was bristly , littered with somethingscaley , dandruff-like , though apparently it was not dandruff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at as his eyes . " Well , " Mickelsson 's father would say as they drove home again , " I thought Edgar looked better , this time . " " Did you ? " his mother would say , giving him a glance . " Well , " his father would say , as if it did n't much matter , really ; eventually all would be well , that was the nature of things . Optimistic fatalist . Mickelsson found himself standing in perfect darkness , in the pitchdarkshade of an abutment that rose steeply to give its heavy rock support to what was now empty air , below it the vast flat landfill floor that was once to have been the plaza . A perfect landing place for UFOs , he thought , and for a moment his memory entertained images from the final scenes of Close Encounters . In the blackness a few feet below him , invisible water lapped at the gravel , stone , and trash lie stood on . For all the cold , the river had a smell , a fetidness like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black mountainside was beautiful with yellow houselightsp236and cold white streetlights . The lights of a truck came slowly down the street , parallel to the river , then vanished behind trees and buildings . He half remembered , then brushed from his mind , the trucks he 'd seen driving with their lights off . Maybe he 'd dreamed the whole thing . A drunken nightmare . He breathed deeply , clearing his head . How many times in fifty years , he asked himself , self-consciously , trying to pull back his earlier , sweeter mood , how many times did a man stand pondering in the night beside some river , remembering former nights , former rivers , counting up his losses ? A man was never more alone , he thought , than when standing by himself looking at the lights of a community across a river , or across a lake , or from the deck of a ship . Had he thought exactly that same thought before , in exactly those same words , perhaps years ago ? No , it came to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Boswell looking at the stars before going up to his latest mistress . What a life ! He turned to look up , ruefully , at the lights of Susquehanna . And what if , for once , he , Mickelsson , were not to go up to his mistress ? What if he were to take one small step toward bringing his life into control reassert his dignity ? It was community that kept one well andsane ; that was the message of the book Michael Nugent had forced on him . Community was what he 'd lost , leaving Providence , and what he 'd fled , leaving Binghamton , and what called to him now in the form of yellow lights rising straight up the black wedge of mountain , lifting toward the lesser , gentler darkness of sky and embedded , icy stars . He moved , frowning with thought , out of the shadow of the abutment onto the wide , gouged-out plaza site . His foolish infatuation was the heart and symbol of all that was wrong with him , his increasingly desperate embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , in Michael Nugent 's sense , the imitation lover who gallantly allowed the whole town to laugh at him  --  anything for love !  --  middle-aged Mickelsson dressed up in ascot and threadbare formal coat for his teen-ager lady of the dark chipped tooth . Had he indeed gone mad , he asked himself . " Love for the unlovable . " Surely it was not true that he was one of those ! Though he 'd almost not dared to think about it , Jessica Stark had shown by certain signs that she was not entirely indifferent to him , there was at least a faint chance . Gail Edelman , dropping her gaze when he glanced at her , smiling at him with a hint of special interest when he politely passed the time of day with her  --  neither he nor she showing by any word or sign that they remembered the night of his drunken visit . . . . It was of course not real love that he felt for Donnie Matthews but some irrationalneed , some sickness . Rifkin would know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It was his firm persuasion , as an ethicist  --  or almost firm that one could choose right conduct , will t he higher man'sself-mastery , if one tvould , in spite of the witless heart 's wail.  |p237He  stopped walking , standing in the middle , now , of the gouged-out desolation . It was true , he saw with sudden clarity : he must not go to her ! His children and ex-wife had need of his money , the money he was squandering , these days , on Donnie Matthews . He stood with his hands pushed deep in his overcoat pockets , his shadow , thrown by the streetlampsabove , stretching across the bulldozed span of gravel and bits of ice-speckled brick . It was decided , he would not go . He would walk back to the Jeep and drive home . Relief flooded through him . There was hope for him yet , then ! Slowly , somewhat against his will , he drew his left hand from his pocket and raised it toward his face for a look at his watch . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wisdom melted . " Shit , " he whispered , and began to walk with quick strides back in the direction of the bridge . It was surprisingly far away . After a moment he began to run . He began to breathe hard , then cough as he ran  --  too much smoking  --  but he continued to run . When he was inside her apartment , the door closed and locked behind him , he shook his overcoat loose and let it fall to the floor , Donnie Matthews staring at him with eyes full of alarm . He stood cocked forward like a maniac , breathing in gasps and rubbing his chest with his clenched right fist . " Peter , you should n't have run , " she said , " you knew I 'd wait for you ! She wore a white , Greek-looking dress and the amber beads he 'd bought for her , no shoes on her small , perfect feet . Her skin shone , lightly perspiring from her recent bath ; her hair was still slightly wet . She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chest , pushing his fist away , taking its place , moving her cheek against him hard , massaging him . " Peter , poor , crazy , crazy Peter , " she murmured . He wrapped his arms around her , clinging for dear life . Her left hand moved to his erection , then unzipped his fly , freeing his straining penis . His heart whammed still harder . Unquestionably , she 'd be the death of him . She slid down on his body , sinking to her knees , and took him in her mouth . He straightened up , arching his back , still gasping for breath . When he began to thrust , she rose , lifted the skirt of her dress  --  she had nothing underneath  --  and climbed up onto him , helping him in with one hand . Tears ran down his face . How many men 's sperm did that warm cave contain ? That was Peter Mickelsson 's community : a thousand dark , writhing lives , unfulfilled , unfulfillable . He came , her legs froze around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . As she put up with other things , she put up with his talk . Lying on his hack beside her , early in the morning , alter sleeping for hours without moving even a linger , like a dead ratan one arm under her head now ,  |p238the  other thrown across his eyes  --  he told of old Pearson 's visit , then of the visit of the Mormons . " Strange people , " she said , and opened her eyes for a moment as if thinking something unpleasant . " Why so ? " he asked , then lowered his wrist to his eyes again . " I do n't know . How can they believe that stuff ? I mean , it 's all a lot of bullshit , but with those other religions you can see how people might be taken in , because the weird stuff all happened so long ago . But Joseph Smith ! People around here actually knew him  --  knew what an asshole he was . My own great-great-grandfather had dealings with him , or so my grandfather used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You had a grandfather ? " " Most people do . He lived in Lanesboro when there were still Indians around , except the Indians lived in Red Rock . There used to be this Indian that would come into town once a year , or maybe twice , I forget  --  he did n't live with the others , in Red Rock , he lived in the woods . He 'd go to Mireiders ' Store  --  it was n't Mireiders ' then  --  and he 'd make a big pile of all the things he needed , and he 'd find owt how much it came to and then he 'd walk back into the woods and he 'd come back owt the next day and pay his bill in gold coins . My grandfather had a dream one time , that the Indian dug the coins owt of a bank up by the viaduct . He always meant to go look there and see if the dream was true , but he never got around to it , and when he died he 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have parents ? " Mickelsson asked . She was silent for a while . At last she said , " The Mormons always play like they 're stupid and sweet , but really they 're mean sons of bitches , or anyway most of ' em are . I guess even the sweet ones have to know what the other ones are doing , and I guess if they put up with it they 're naht so sweet either . " He smiled , still with his eyes closed , hidden under his arm . " What do they do , these mean ones ? " " Torture people . Harris them . " " Harass . " " Well , however you say it . " " How do you know they harass people ? " " I know , do n't worry . " She spoke petulantly , as if she did n't know , in fact . Mickelsson drifted toward sleep for a moment , then drifted back up into consciousness , thinking of the shabby , pitiful Mormons at his door . " They 're a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from premises we ca n't fully defend , but the Mormons are true , deep-down absurdists . " " Mmm , " she said ; then , after a moment : " What . do you mean ? " He turned his face to hers , then rolled over toward her , consc.ioiis of how huge he was , in comparison to her -- how wasted , gross . No doubtp239that had to do with his heart 's choice of her : since he paid her , it need not concern him that he was old and fat . He stroked the side of her forehead and cheek with the fingertips of his right hand . She stopped him , holding the hand in hers . " What do you mean , absurdists ' ? " " They 're people that know that nothing makes sense , the whole universeis crazy , or so they claim , but they go right on acting as if things make sense . " He drew his hand free of hers and touched her face again . Could it be true , as Ellen claimed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Mormons start with this insane , made-up history  --  Jesus Christ coming to someplace like Peru , where he meets not only Indians but also white people who look exactly like Charlton Heston playing Moses and out of this craziness they make a huge , rich church , complete with army and police , or anyway so people will tell you out in Utah ; they make a whole new style of architecture , new theory of the universe , new system of family relationships . . . . It 's an amazing accomplishment , when you think about it . They 've stepped out of normal time and space , and so far as you can tell , most of ' em are n't even aware of the fact . " " All religions are like that , " she said . Again she stopped his hand . " I do n't know . The Mormons seem pretty special . Anyhow , they take care of each other . There 's something to be said for that . " " I 'd just as soon take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drew his hand back and lay still , looking at her eyelashes , the faint suggestion of veins in her forehead , feeling gloom rise in him , recallingto him its cause , that soon he must leave her . It was true , Mickelsson thought : she really would just as soon take care of herself . A true , natural feminist  --  unless perhaps she 'd gotten her ideas from TV . All at once he thought he understood something . She would talk with him for hours as if with interest , sometimes closely watching his face as he answered some question she 'd put to him , exactly as she would do if she cared about his opinion , that is , loved him ; yet she insisted , over and over , that she did not love him  --  liked him , certainly ; liked everyone , why not ?  --  but love : no ; never . She 's wrong , he thought , and felt his heart lift . She 's lying to herself , from her fear of entrapment . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was a question he did not feel up to this morning ; but suddenly he was absolutelysure that she did indeed love him . In the crisp morning light , the cracked paint on the window sash was like writing , like some form of Arabic . His eyes moved on to the wallpaper , dark gray and green on a base so yellowed it looked scorched . The tight wallpaper design looked as though it , too , Wright he writing . He looked at the pattern of veins in her chest and thought not quite seriously but seriously playing with the possibility that at any instant , it in some way his mind-set could be minutely shitted , she too would be language , all mysteries revealed . " I have to go , " he staid.  |p240She  nodded , still with her eyes closed . " I 'm glad you came . " He eased up onto the side of the bed , reached down for his socks , and put them on , then got into his undershorts and shirt . She asked , half sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic pill thing on the dresser ? " He did . It was a pink plastic , numbered birth-control-pill dispenser . She thanked him , got out a pill , then whispered , " Shit . " " What 's the matter ? " he asked . She shrugged . " I forgot my damn pill yesterday , " she said . " Do n't worry , I 'll just take two today . It 's all right . Do n't look so panicky ! " She laughed , delighted by the no doubt old-maidish look of horror on his face . " It 's all right , believe me . It 's happened before . Do n't worry about ole Donnie , kiddo ! She 's strictly professional ! " " Christ , I hope so , " he said . He put on his shoes . She lay back , moving over into the middle of the bed , now that he was out of it , and spread her legs wide . She smiled , not enough to let the broken tooth show . " Think of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to kiss the air . " Do n't worry , " he said gloomily , cinching his belt . He turned his back to her , his heart growing heavier , darker by the moment , as much with guilt and self-revulsion as with sorrow ; he counted out the money and slipped one corner of the stack of bills under the base of the elf lamp on her dresser ; then he picked up his hat , cane , and overcoat in the livingroom , fixed the nightlatch so the door would lock behind him , and let himself out . He hardly noticed when someone on the stairway said , " Morning , Professor . " But then it came through to him , and he stopped , looking down the third-floor hallway in the direction of the two black-coated young men . At the fat man 's door they stopped walking and , looking hack , saw him watching them . The dark-haired one smiled and nodded a second greeting while the blond one reached toward the fat man 's door and knocked . Needless to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw now . They would n't tell . In all probability those poor shabby innocents did n't even know what kind of business she ran . ( Do them good , he thought ; one night with Donnie Matthews . Both of them together , so they could spy on each other , keep up the ole support system . ) He heard the fat man 's voice , then the door opening on its chain . Odd that he would open it at all , Mickelsson thought . No doubt after a time one grew lax . He put his left hand on the bannister , his right holding the cane by its silver head , and started down . Around eleven that morning he was roused from desperately needed sleep by the tangling of the phone . Ile got up , shaking his head , rubbing his eyes , clearing his throat . to get his voice operational , crossed to thep241phone on the bedroom wall and answered . When he heard the voice at the other end , he at first thought someone must be playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened , almost exactly the voice of Bugs Bunny , but the accent was desperately low-class Italian , too extreme by many degrees to be real , and the words the voice spoke were so comically mad  --  or such was Mickelsson 's first impression  --  so unprompted , simultaneously hysterical and bellicose , reminiscent of the long-ago radio-days wackos who lived on Allen 's Alley , that he smiled as he listened , trying to think who would do this to him , until little by little the smile decayed and he understood that the maniac on the line was serious . " Professor Mickelsson ? " " Yes . " " My name is Ernest diSapio , that 's right diSapio as in ' sap , ' but do n't count on it ; I 'm with the Internal Revenue Service , Scranton office , and I have here on my desk a letter allegedly written by you to this office on October twelfth . You claim in this letter that the I.R.S. has been harassing and bird-dogging you , according to your presumption because you dint pay your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law prescribes . I wunt go around making charges of that nature if I was in your position , Professor , but that 's neither here nor there . I 'm now calling you to tell you two things , which the first is , we do n't bird-dog , we do n't need to , because the power is with us as you will see if you keep vilating federal law and trying to play cat and mouse with the Service , in fact we dint even know you was in the area and no longer in Binghamton , New York , until your letter let it slip . And which the second is , I have now been personally assigned to your case and I strongly advise you to cooperate in the fullest . " " Who is this ? " Mickelsson asked . " My name as I said earlier is Ernest diSapio , and I 'm an agent with the Internal Revenue Service , Scranton office , P.O. Box 496 , Scranton , Penn-sylvania . " " Wait a minute , " Mickelsson said . Tentatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in my office between nine and eleven on Monday morning , November seventeenth , with a fully documented account of  --  " " Hey , hold on , " Mickelsson said , his anger rising now . " I do n't know if this call is a joke or not , but I teach on Mondays , and I have no intention  --  " " I can show you pretty quickly that this is no joke . I have the power to swear out a warrant for your arrest . If I was you , Professor  --  " " Listen , Mr. Sapid or whoever you are , I do n't know why you 're taking this tutu  --  with me , but I assure you I do n't like it . It may be that all you ever deal with is criminals , in which case I 'm sorry for you , butp242I am not a criminal , and I must ask you to keep a civil tongue in your head . " He was trembling a little . In a minute he 'd be shouting . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In that case I 'm sure you will have no objection to meeting me in this office between nine and eleven on November seventeenth . The address  --  " " Slow down , God damn it ! " Mickelsson shouted . " As I 've told you already , I teach on Mondays . Besides that , I have no information to give you , everything I have is with my lawyer , you 'll have to talk with him . " " Mr. Mickelsson , I do n't want to play games with you . In my book you 're a skip : you moved from Binghamton , New York , without sending us notification ; in 1977 you filed but neglected to pay your taxes , and in both seventy-eight and seventy-nine you filed late and again have not paid . Now you may have explanations for all the above , but since you dint see fit to give them in your letter of complaint to this office , and since your attitude is clearly hostile to the work of this office  --  " " However that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly aware that the maniac really might have the power he claimed , " I can not give you the information you want ; you 'll have to talk to my lawyer . I 'll give you his name and phone number . " There was a pause . At last diSapio said , " Very well . Let me have ' em . " He gave the man Jake Finney 's name and number . " All right , Professor Mickelsson , " diSapio said , " I 'll be back in touch . If I was you I 'd get a lawyer in Pennsylvania . You 're gon na need it . " " I 'll do that . Thank you . " Just before diSapio hung up , Mickelsson remembered and said : " One more thing . You say the I.R.S. has not been spying on me ? I 'm sorry to bother you , and I 'm certainly sorry to have accused you falsely , if I have  --  I do n't blame you for being cross , I suppose  --  but there 's been someone , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dark green unmarked cars .... " " Not us , Professor . According to my records you 're separated from your wife . Maybe she 's put a private dick on you . " " That 's not her style , " Mickelsson said , mostly to himself . " Sorry I ca n't help you , " diSapio said . Suddenly his voice was friendly , amused . With the change in tone he seemed to Mickelsson more than ever the voice of the Reich : savage , primordial , merciless . " Well , thanks . " " I 'll be in touch . " That afternoon when he tried to work on his blockbuster book , the found his mind was cement . Not only could he not write , he could see no value in anything he 'd written . IIe remembered how pleased he 'd been by some of the pages stacked beside the typewriter , but reading them over now , trying to give them every benefit of the doubt , he thought he must simply have been insane . It was , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a blockbuster philosophy book ! He turned off the electric typewriter  --  all the time he 'd spent looking at his finished pages , he 'd allowed it to hum to him  --  then stood up and raised the sheaf of papers in his hand , about to throw them in the wastebasket . At the last moment he changed his mind : perhaps another day they would n't seem so bad , would at least seem revisable . He put them back beside the typewriter , face down . He would work a little more on the house . That night he began on the hardest of the jobs he 'd set himself , the transformation of the crooked , unheated workroom into what would be , eventually , his diningroom . It had seemed an almost impossible job all those afternoons and nights when he 'd stood looking in at it , sipping a drink , thinking about what had to be done . There was a double sink to be taken out ; a workbench ; crude , cheaply stained pine cupboards and shelves ; wallpaper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linoleum flooring and the waterstained false ceiling . But once he 'd put his gloves on and begun to tear into it with the wreckingbar  --  his pipe and a glass of gin for company , on the portable radio some newscaster talking about Reagan 's vast support in Texas and his " undisclosed plan " for freeing the hostages  --  the work of demolition went more quickly than he would have thought possible . The shelves and cupboards had been carelessly put up and came out easily . The sink was not much harder , and the panelling came off in three fierce yanks . The fiberboard ceiling panels broke away like cake , and , climbing once more onto his rickety chair , he began on the wallpapered plaster and lath . By four in the morning , when he was on his third glass of gin and the ceiling was half down , his neck and shoulders numb from his exertion , he began to make discoveries . ( He 'd turned off the staticky radio long since . ) At the far end of the room every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportbracedand blackened by fire . Even more interesting was the fact that here , as nowhere else in the house , the nails were square . It was the oldest section , then , as he 'd suspected . Probably this room and the attic above it were all there had been of the house for a good many years . No wonder it had gone through so many wallpapers , so many changes of function . He worked in a kind of dream , almost a trance , the room so full of dust that he could barely see . He wore a mask over his nose and mouth , goggles over his eyes . His pipe and the glass of gin on the floor in the corner of the room he 'd covered with his handkerchief . From time to time he stopped to replace the filter in the mask and clean the goggles , but increasingly it became an idle gesture : even with the door open , propped against the woodpile , the turbulent dust and floating wallpaper chips made the room so dark and murky it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would not remember later what thought% came as he  --  worked.  |p244After  painting , sanding , making various fairly extensive repairs to the other rooms , he was used to the way the mind drifted freely when the body was engaged ; but never before tonight had it been quite like this . It was not just the gin , the heavy darkness of dust through which he moved , wandering half lost in a room only fourteen by twenty  --  though both the gin and the dustcloud no doubt had their part in it . Lath and plaster , breaking away from the beams , opened squares of darkness like revelations . He stared deep into them but could see nothing , neither attic roof nor sky . With each tear-away of plaster and lath , dirt fell down into the room as from a shovel ( he thought of Freddy Rogers ' stone falls ) , struck the floor with a thud , and billowed upward again , pushing up like smoke all around him . In his mind he saw the dog floating through weeds like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the mountain with his dowsing rod , his whole soul and body intent on the discovery theoretically impossible for him to make . Witchcraft drifted into Mickelsson 's mind and seemed to him normal , not surprising : he imagined Pearson bent over a table where there were gloves , perhaps fingernails , speaking the name of the person they belonged to , drawing her toward him through the night . He tried to think where he 'd gotten that image  --  something he 'd seen , or possibly something someone had told him . But nothing came . Pearson had been joking , no doubt ; so Mickelsson had by now convinced himself . A " waterwitch , " maybe ; not really a witch . Yet in the dark , dust-filled room it seemed clear that no joke was ever wholly or solely a joke , not even what Rogers had called the " kidding around " of the universe . Whatever it occurred to one to say  --  anyone  --  was at some level true . At any rate , this much seemed sure : that Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickelsson was not . He knew without looking where the dog had gone off to , knew even what was happening under the ground . He thought of Pearson 's words , " Most likely you see ' em and just do n't notice . " It was a theory that Mickelsson had encountered before , that psychic insights are for the most part trivial : a vague intrusion of someone else 's personality , foreknowledgeof a speed-trap , or that a letter of no real importance will be waiting in one 's mailbox . His grandfather , after the arrival of his gift , had for the most part had visions as clear and detailed as applecrates on a hayrack , but there were times all he got was hunches , like the hunches of a blind man . He found himself imagining staring into the dust  --  the outlines of a shabby woodstove at the far end of the room , a gaunt , middle-aged woman in a gray dress bending down beside it , reaching toward a woodbox . In her right hand she had a wadded-up hankie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the fire would have started , yes . A woman full of troubles , no longer alert , an unsafe old stove ... 1le could know a good deal about the house , if he li.t himself . Long helote the doomed brothel.  |p245and  sister had lived there , there had to have been other generations , people who 'd grown old in the house when it was only a one- or tworoomsaltbox . He thought about what kind of man would have built the place  --  cleared the trees , dug the foundation , notched the cornerbeams and nailed up the walls . Perhaps a young settler not even in his twenties , proud of himself , joyful in his freedom from dull New England parents , or parents hack in Germany a young man with a blond young wife as charged with animal vitality as he was , a big-smiled , big-bosomed , strongleggedyoung woman he fucked every night till the roof shook . He imaginedit so vividly his genitals tingled ; meanwhile the unhappy woman in gray  --  some long-forgotten cousin or aunt , perhaps , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , kneading bread . Her hands moved with an odd ferocity , as if driven by inner violence . He could smell the bread-dough , sweet and yeasty . The woman 's head was bowed , her black hair rolled up and pinned . Between the two narrow cords at the back of her neck lay a dark , deep valley . Then for a while he seemed to think nothing at all , simply watched the wreckingbar stab deep beneath the plaster and lath and pry them free . Once he barked his knuckles and swore ; yet in a way he was pleased , remembering his father 's hands , and his uncle 's . Once , reaching down for what he thought to be a large scrap of wallpaper , he discovered with a start  --  as if the wallpaper had magically changed in his hand  --  the picture of Jesus looking sadly toward Heaven , a beautiful young man with no hope for humanity or himself . He thought of his son 's look of sorrowful detachment as he rode in the Marin Riding Show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping wildly and shouting herself voiceless , Mickelsson beaming , his weight-lifter arms folded on his wide chest . " Son , I ca n't tell you how proud we are ! " Mickelsson had said as they drove home . His son had said , " Thanks , " and without another word had turned to stare out the window . " Did I say something wrong ? " Mickelsson had asked his wife . She 'd smiled , her large teeth brilliant , as always , and had said nothing . His only consolation was that Leslie too seemed baffled , her expression as thoughtful as a cat 's . And now , as if there were some connection , Mickelsson 's thought drifted to the unbeautiful , earnest young Mormons pressing through the world with red noses and ears  --  like ants , like bees , as Pearson had said  --  urging their gospel of safety in numbers , organized conspiracy against death and the Devil , litah 's vast army of locked-together minds . They would prevail , no question about it . They , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Entitle , the terrible survivors . They were good with computers , %Vonelerful at business administration ; no unruly habits . While he was thinking this concerned , really , about his own situation , and even that not quite Ionseiously , his attention unfocused , only dimly awate of why the NIotntotts so bothered hits in his present moodp246a man adrift between yellow-lighted worlds like a dustcloud mindlessly wandering in space , toying with the possibility of collapsing into a planet  --  Mickelsson thought he heard a woman 's voice say , angrily but desperatelyhiding her anger , " I 'm not well , I guess , " and then another voice answering with a grunt . Surprised , Mickelsson turned his head , straining to pierce the room 's dimness , but there was nothing ; a dream-voice , some old memory . He shook his head as if to wake himself , then sucked in breath and stabbed hard into the plaster and lath , prying away a great hunk above the door into the livingroom . " Dad ? " someone said , making Mickelsson jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell he heard a clink such as coins might make , or old brass jewelry . He got down off the chair , stepping clumsily because his legs were overtired , and bent down to sort with his gloved hand through the trash on the floor . After a moment , he found something and raised it toward his goggles to study it more closely : an old-fashioned wooden cheesebox with a sliding top . He forced the top open ; then , removing the glove from his right hand , still holding the box up close to his goggles , poked inside with two fingers . The box was full of keys . Mickelsson carried the box into the livingroom , carefully closing the door of the dust-filled workroom behind him . Slipping off his goggles and mask , he bent by the lamp in the corner to inspect his find more closely . It was evident at a glance that whatever doors , gates , trunks , or boxes the keys had once opened , whatever treasures or keepsakes they had guarded  --  whatever hands had turned those keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished from the earth . That instant a crash came from the cellar , right under his feet . He strode to the cellar door , determined this time to catch the damn thing , whatever it might be . He opened the door , switched the light on , and thudded on wobbly legs down the steep , narrow steps , almost falling in his haste . He stopped at the bottom and looked carefully all around . Mouldy , crooked beams , the filthy oil furnace , shelves crammed with rusted , mouldering paint cans  --  all he had left from the mountains of junk that had lain here when he came . . . He could see no sign of an intruder . The shadows seemed to peer back at him , like children in hiding , but nothing moved . Was it possible , he wondered , that rattlesnakes could come into a cellar and , in its warmth , stay awake through the winter ? Not likely . He would get a book from the library , try to find out . Probablyit was rats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen , watching and listening all the way . In his gloved left hand he held an old rusted key , the teeth blurred away to nothing . He imagined he smelled freshly baked cake . Then the scent was gone.  |p247Before  the concert , Mickelsson and Jessica had drinks at her house . He could hardly tell what he felt as he pushed the lighted-up button that rang her doorbell  --  guilty , shoddy , angry at having been put in this position of fake respectability , at the same time miserably unworthy : she was a beautiful woman , he a laboriously cleaned-up derelict ; for all he knew , he had the clap . Not that he 'd noticed any sign yet . Matter of time . But as soon as she opened the door and gave him her smile , at the same time taking a step back , saying " Hi ! Come in ! "  --  Mickelsson tipping his hat to her like a big friendly sheriff  --  his churning emotions settled ; he felt safe . Her hair flowed around her shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a white blouse and string-tie and tweedy light brown trousers , part of a suit  --  the coat lay on the arm of the couch . She held her fingers apart as if she had wet nailpolish on them , though he could see none . The clear kind , perhaps . " I 'm running late , as usual , " she said . " Ilo you want to fix us drinks ? I 'll just have sherry . " Before he could do more than mumble " Fine , OK  --  " she was off down the hallway , calling over her shoulder , " Still raining ? " " A little , " he said , opening the doors of the Swedish-modern cabinet where she kept her small store of liquor : Beefeater gin and the cheapest vermouth available , X-brand bourbon , one good Scotch , an assortment of circusy , undrinkable liqueurs , a bottle of Harvey 's Bristol Cream that had probably been there for two , three years . He decided on straight gin for himself and took out the Harvey 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost fringe . " Could turn to snow , " he called , then rose , setting the bottles on top of the cabinet , and headed toward the kitchen for ice . " You really think so ? " she called back . " My shoes will be moosh . I suppose if I can find my what's-its ... " Mickelsson laughed , still morose but coming around , unable to help himself . " Roots ? " he offered . " Galoshes ? " He dropped three ice cubes into his glass , then returned to the livingroom . Just as he finished filling her sherry glass , Jessica reappeared and sat down in a wide brown overstuffedchair , slipping off her shoe so she could fork her right foot under her left leg . Mien she reached up for the glass he held out to her , trying not to let her see his ragged c uff , it shoe k hint that the lift of her arm wasp248exactly like a ballet dancer 's , yet natural , unconsidered . " What a day ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bending closer , looking down at her like a surgeon . He stole a peek at her bosom , then backed off , drink in hand , and lowered himself onto the couch . It had come to be a frequent topic with them , the Marxists in sociology  --  in Mickelsson 's opinion the stupidest so-called professors he 'd ever met ( not counting Levinson , perhaps ) , though in fact he had no evidence except for what he 'd seen of one or two of them at parties  --  that and his invariable experience of Marxists elsewhere , both alive and in print . In Jessica 's view , or so she claimed , they were at worst no more than a nuisance , " sincere and earnest , whateverelse , " she kept insisting , though once she slipped and referred to them as " like a squadron of mosquitoes in the bedroom . " . When pressed she would admit that possibly someday they might prove a threat ; she broke their solidarity . Not too serious a threat , presumably : except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in debate , if she chose to ( she probably would not ) she could whip their asses  --  Mickelsson'sexpression , or President Jimmy Carter 's ; anyway , not Jessica 's . " I 'll tell you , " she said , " you should be grateful for a chairman as smart and good-hearted as Tillson ! " " And good-looking , " he said . There was distance in her smile . " That 's not exactly his fault , you know . " He bowed , Oriental . " Dumb thing to say ; most sorry . " He raised his glass . " Cheers ! " She touched his glass with hers . " And may the concert not be awful ! " They sipped ritually . He asked , " You think it might be ? " " Well , you saw the Swissons at the Blicksteins ' , how they hide behind each other . After you , dear ! ' After you , dear ! ' That kind of thing could get pretty embarrassing on stage , maybe a contest to see who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whose idea was this concert , anyway ? " " I guess I asked you , " she said . She raised her shoulders and arms dramatically . " Well , somebody had to do it . " She laughed . " That 's true , " he said , and nodded soberly . " You did the right thing . " " Anyway , I 'm sure it will be wonderful , " she said . " Are n't they supposedto be famous or something ? " " We 're all supposed to be . " He shrugged sadly . She laughed again , then raised her drink and sipped it . He found himself bothered by the tone she was taking toward the Swissons . It was true that they were n't instantly charming , but if they were excellent musicians , as they were said to be ... Something about her view of them struck him as unpleasantly -- secular . Not just irreverent ; somethingdeeper , that he had no word for . Clinical . A tendency to look atp249human specimens  --  perceiving nothing wrong in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it either ; she could be more just than he was  --  as she was , for instance , about Tillson . Were all women like that ? Was it the case that men were all , like young Blassenheim , idealists  --  lovers of the Good , even when , like Mickelsson , they denied its existence , and therefore eager to give the benefit of the doubt , and made miserable by each inevitable lapse of flesh and brain  --  while women , for all their otherworldly attractiveness , were cold-blooded realists , indifferent to the rainbowed , celestial crypt , even at the noblest peaks of poetry or the loveliest moments in music planning out which hat to wear shopping ? It was the opinion , he thought gloomily , of a male chauvinist pig . It had been The Comedian , Ellen 's friend , more than Ellen himself , who had made him aware of how strong that impulse was in him . " You really believe that , do n't you , " the young man had said , smiling , far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he rememberedmeeting the young man 's brown eyes and understanding with a shock that he , Mickelsson , was indeed , as the young man implied , a kind of living fossil , wrong through and through . Mickelsson had drawn back into himself and the rest of the night had refused to come out . " Stop sulking , " Ellen had said when the others had gone home . She flashed her smile , as wide and impersonal as the smile of a model in a Sears catalogue , and later , at something like two in the morning , she and the young man had gone off somewhere . It seemed to Mickelsson now that he 'd been sulking ever since. ... like my husband , " Jessica was saying , slightly smiling , looking down . " What a bum . " He awakened to the realization that , for all her smile , she was speaking carefully , controlling strong emotion , imagining Mickelsson to be listeningwith the interest and sympathy his expression seemed to show . Less bum than I am , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the dead man he 'd never known , a gentle personality adrift everywhere in the room , in the black leather chair , the tall African drums ( he realized with a shock how absurd it was that all this time he 'd felt superior to a man who knew trees , black African languages , the politics of ecology ) . . . . Jessica above all , touching her collarbone with the tips of two fingers , as if she were feeling a light pain there , was an expression of the dead man 's taste . " But of course he was always the soul of tact , " she said , turning her shadowed eyes on Mickelsson . " Saying exactly what you meant was uncivil . You can see where that put Inc . South Borneo . " " You 're tactful in the long run , " Mickelsson said . " Just trickier . " She thought about it . " I hope that 's true . " Woefully , he thought of the big , battered deep truck waiting outside in the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rightp250front mirror angling out  --  as it had been when he 'd bought it  --  like a broken dodo 's wing . " What do you think ? " she asked . " Shall we go or have another ? " He pursed his lips and lowered his eyebrows in a comic frown . It seemed to him conceivably an invitation to spend the evening , miss the concert . His eye fell on the stereo  --  futuristic , expensive , another tactful observation from beyond the grave . If she was as blunt as she claimed to be , he was a real dunderhead ; the more he tried to figure out her signals , the more confused he became . He remembered how when he was moving his hand on her leg she 'd stopped him , in no uncertain terms , with her foot . He looked at his watch . " I guess we 'd better get going , if we 're going , " he said . He could n't tell whether her smile was one of relief or just bafflement . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , still smiling indecipherably , " I 'll get my coat . " They rose together ; he could n't tell which of them had caused it , and even now he was toying in panic with the idea of staying . The idea of their future fell away like the corridor in one of those Texas super-motels he 'd stayed in from time to time when attending conferences ; but whether that was bad or good he could n't tell . While she searched through the closet beside the front door , Mickelsson put on his own coat . At the far end of the hallway , the bedroom door was open , dim light falling over the bedspread of fringed yellow-gold . Her dead husband , watching solemnlyfrom the edges of the room , would approve . " Be good to my wife , " he would say , as Mickelsson had said in his heart to the young man who was able to be not just lover but friend to his wife . Ah , that this all too sullied flesh would melt , thaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . Jessica slipped her gloved hand between Mickelsson 's waist and elbow and gently laid the fingers on his arm . When they stepped outside , they saw that the rain had turned , as he 'd thought it might , into softly fallingsnow . The Jeep , to Mickelsson , looked sullen and defensively selfrighteous , as if thinking of the height to which the lady must lift her leg if she intended to get in . A dog stood on the sidewalk twenty feet away , looking up at them from something it had been sniffing . It lowered its head , apologetic , and moved off . " What a beautiful night ! " Jessica said , raising her face so the snow could fall on it . Outside the Jean Casadesus Auditorium they saw everyone they knew , all dressed to the nines  --  the Bryants , Edith in a mink stole , Phil in the shabbily expensive attire of a British lord ; the Garrets , Mabel in drab , funereal black , Tom in a black turtleneck sweater and a brown sportcoat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell-bottoms ; the Meyersons ; the 1 Iicksteins ; several of his students . . .  |p251Conversation  roared like a sea around them . Suddenly , Tillson was at Mickelsson 's elbow , bowing and grinning , speaking in the cracked voice of an adolescent : " Good to see ya , Pete ! Gosh , Jessie ! Good to see ya ! " He grabbed her right hand in both of his . " Is n't this exciting ? " She nodded , smiling , resting her left hand on Mickelsson 's back . " Is n't it ? " she said . Mickelsson nodded and smiled . " Well , I better get back to my place on line , " Tillson said , giving his head an extreme sideways jerk . " God bless you ! Happy evening ! " He fled . " Poor Geoffrey ! " Jessica said , and smiled . It was true , as Freddy Rogers had observed at the Blicksteins ' , that Katie Swisson had a " sweet , sweet voice "  --  sweet , pure , elegant , and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seemed unhealthily pale , as did her husband at the piano , but that was the least of it . She had a queer way of striking her notes with the tip of her nose and her eyebrows , and she sang bent forward at the waist , hands eagerly clasped , eyes overlarge and bright , as if to say , " Is n't this delightful ? Is n't this fun ? " She wore a narrow-strapped , low-necked teal dress that looked to Mickelssonremarkably like a slip , and on the bun at the back of her blond head she had pinned a dark red rose . Her husband 's piano playing was if anythingeven more self-conscious than her singing . He leaned far back and occasionally shook his head as if to say , " Oh no ! Oh no ! " or nodded as if to say , " Oh yes ! Oh yes ! " then brought his blond head sweeping forward dramatically , as if to butt the piano , then at the last moment stopped , jerked his head up with an open-mouthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed a smile to his wife , who seemed to take wonderful pleasure in his antics , and leaned far back again as if to make the audience believe it was not he who made that curious tinkling in the treble . " There 's the answer to the energy shortage , " Mickelsson whispered . " We could strap some kind of machine to them , run the lights or some-thing . " Jessica raised one finger to her lips . He closed his eyes , thinking if perhaps he only heard and did not see , all would be well . But alas , in his mind they bobbed and weaved as grotesquelyas ever . When he opened his eyes again and glanced around , it seemed that in all the audience he alone was unenraptured . He leaned slightly toward Jessica and whispered , " Ah , I get it ! It 's Art ! " She pointedly did not hear him , sitting with her head lifted , smiling with appreciation . Christ but she was beautiful ! Fake as hell , just now ; but beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She seemed actually to be enjoying it , though it was she herself who had warned hint that it : tight Iu  --  awful . Once or twice she nodded and almost laughed with delight . It was a tact , prthal-s , that the whole thing was ridiculous , but he 'd better not trust his judgment . ' ! ' hough he 'd had onlyp252one glass of gin , it had been a good-sized glass , and on an empty stomach . He would give the audience the benefit of the doubt . Anyway , music had never been his language . Spiritual insensitivity , no doubt , like Faust 's . Deaf to even the noblest arguments . See , see , where Christ 's bloom streams in the firmament ! He tried to listen to the words of the song , since some of them at least seemed to be English , and after a moment he discovered that it was somethingold-timey , not Shakespeare , but something vintage : " Stay me with flagons , Comfort me with apples , for lam sick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she was still all attention , then slouched down in his seat . " With lit-uh-uh-uh-uh-uv ! " Kate Swisson sang . Her eyes had that glistening , lidless look embarrassingly common among Swedes . All around him students , professors , and townspeople listened reverently , as they would listen to the solemn intonings of a Carter , Anderson , or Reagan on TV . Some of the people around him were smiling , little teary glints in their eyes . He sighed . " Do n't make a scene , " he cautioned himself . " Culture is not for everyone . " He let his eyes drift again over the audience and suddenly came alert . The brown-eyed young woman he 'd met in the kitchen at Blicksteins ' , widow of the murdered chemistry professor , was here at the concert with the dean and his wife , sitting between them like a daughter , the dean 's arm on the top of the seatback behind her , just barely not touching her , nestled against her hair . The young woman sat with her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that her eyes were hidden , perhaps allowing her to sleep or , conceivably  --  he smiled at the thought  --  cry . Then it crept over him that she was crying . " Fool , " he told himself , clenching his fist . He thought of how he 'd blindly trod on the Polish girl 's feelings in his graduate medicalethics class . Kate Swisson sang , smiling frantically , " The voice of my beloved ! Behold he cometh , leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .... " Idiotically , the piano made jumping noises in the bass , and all around Mickelsson , people laughed . He craned his neck , making sure it was not that something had happened on the stage , hut no , it was the music : all was normal , if any of this hoity-toity foolishness was normal- t Swisson twins grinning happily , both of them swaying like Muppcts on ' 1'V . I kp253thought , abruptly smiling , of what Donnie Matthews would think of all this , or Tim . " Faggots ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at once he backed off . They were not his people either . As soon as the diningroomwas finished , he thought , he must have a party . That would be a good time , as long as the party were n't too close to Christmas . He was n't quite up yet to full-fledged Christmas feeling . Perhaps his son would show up , stay for a while with Mickelsson , talking about the nukes , straightening out old problems . It was surely not unthinkable . What rage he must have felt when they 'd smashed his camera , what absolute bafflement , given the trust in life Mickelsson had done his best to instill in him . They would talk , perhaps shout , as when Mickelsson had tried to make him not afraid of horses . He saw the horse rearing , his son flying off , terrified and helplessly enraged . Mark had been seven or eight then . It was at one of those riding stables , snowy mountains in the distance . " For Christ 's sake , it 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive his son to courage by pure fury . " I hate animals , " Mark had yelled back , crying , looking wild-eyed , crawling away on all fours from his father as if he , Mickelsson , were an animal , the most dangerous and stupid of them all . Mickelsson cringed , remembering it . But Mark had indeed overcome his fear  --  had become a fine rider , secretly proud of himself . Perhaps it was possible . It would make sense , all things considered . Mark would appear from nowhere , like a deer from the woods or the first midwinter robin . He would be bearded , duffle-bagged , loaded down with books and pamphlets . And what if the boy were to meet Donnie ? He felt a blush stinging his face . He must definitely have a party , show off the house . He began to work out in his mind what date the Friday two weeks before Christmas would fall on . Election Day was next week , the fourth ... . Without warning , the Swissons ' song stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clapped with what surely must be genuine pleasure . Britt Swisson rose from the piano to bow  --  he seemed almost to be laughing  --  and the clapping grew louder . From here and there throughout the auditorium came whistles and shouts of " Bravo ! " It was , by God , an event , Mickelsson thought . The Blicksteins ' young woman was leaning far forward , clapping violently . Perfectly together , like two grinning dolls , the Swissons bowed and bowed . Then at last the clapping diminished and died , and Britt Swisson went back to the piano . He and his wife watched each other , nodding to an inaudible beat , nodding like two children about to leap into the flip of a jutuprope ; then suddenly , exactly together , they started singing and playing , nli*kelsson lowered himself in his seat a little and sullenly closed his eyes . " / am come into my garden , my sister , my spoucc , " Kate Swisson sang , het blue eyes round as saucers.  | " Who would 've believed from meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the Swissons would turn out to be comics ! " Mickelsson , for civility 's sake , said nothing . He thought again of old Pearson 's idea of the Mormon God , alien and terrible , watching the activitiesof humanity with the detachment of a spider . " They must 've had the most fun working up their act ! " Edie cried , bending toward Mickelsson and Jessica to make herself heard . Jessica called back , laughing , " You make them sound like a vaudeville team ! " " But what else ? " Edie cried , tossing her curls and merrily batting the air ; then , turning to draw in Mabel Garret , " They 're a team , Mabel , are n't they ? Nobody doubts they 're artistes , of course ! " Mabel said nothing , smiling rather oddly at Mickelsson , her brown eyes hooded , as if she 'd heard some terrible rumor about him and had not yet definitely made up her mind . " Well I approve , " Edie said , dictatorial . " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't all art play ? " She turned suddenly to Mickelsson . " What do you think , Peter ? You know all about aesthetics ! " " Yes , " he said , slightly bowing , like a count , intentionally off register . She smiled as if it were exactly what she 'd hoped he would say , and as she turned back to the Garrets , then quickly to her husband , realizing just an instant too late how difficult it would be to play off doom-faced Mabel , Mickelsson backed off a step , getting out his pipe , and edged into the chattering , smiling crowd , toward the double doors . When Jessica glanced at him , as if surprised at his abandoning her to the Bryants , Mickelsson smiled and held up his pipe as explanation . She made a face , then turned back to Edith . In the commons outside , it was still snowing , large flakes falling softly , thickly , so that the tower of the Ad Building was a barely visible wedge against the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building and here , spilling out past the doors behind him , there was no one about on the commons . Under the long lines of goose-necked lamps the falling snow bloomed brighter , the whole scene forming some pattern he recognized . It came to him at last : ballet ; London ; his daughter Leslie in the seat beside him , holding his hand , leaning forward with an expression of intense concentration , taking in the dance just as , once , in Paris or Rome  --  some old , high-ceilinged , inexpensive hotel  --  she 'd sat up suddenly in the darkness , bending forward intently , as Mickelsson and Ellen abruptly broke off their love-making . He gripped his pipe between his teeth and raised a match to it . As he did so , it came to him that something was standing just behind him in the darkness , almost at his elbow , though most of the others stayed close to the building , out of the cold . When he turned , he saw Tom Garret smiling at him sociably.  | " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know you smoked . " " I do n't , " Garret said , and grinned , holding up both hands to show that they were empty . " Ca n't afford it ; too many mouths to feed . Just came out for the air . Enjoying the concert ? " From his cherub , squirrelcheekedgrin it was clear that he , like Jessica and the others , was having a dandy time . Mickelsson blew out smoke and half turned away . " I guess I must not be in the mood , " he said . " That 'll happen , " Garret said lightly , as if Mickelsson 's remark were not evasion but familiar truth . " Sometimes the waters just are n't flowing . " For some reason the observation stirred Mickelsson 's feelings . He was reminded of old John Pearson , marching up and down the mountain with his dowsing rod ; and he remembered Pearson 's saying , " Seems like the land 's gaht a spell on it . " Mickelsson cleared his throat and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Garret nodded . " Yeah . I guess they take her everywhere . " Mickelsson moved closer to him . " Why is that , do you know ? " " You did n't hear ? " Garret asked . He brushed snowflakes from his nose . " I know her husband was murdered . That 's about all I know . " Garret looked out into the empty commons . He stood with his arms folded on his banty chest , stomach thrown forward , and he rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet . " That 's about all anybody knows , " he said . " Awful thing . " His tone was oddly light , conversational , though it was clear enough that he took the matter seriously . " They 'd only been married a month or so , very happy , and so forth and so on . " " I 'm sorry . What was the connection with the Blicksteins ? " " The husband worked part-time in Blickstein 's office , some kind of administrative assistant or something  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess the Blicksteins got friendly with ' em . " " And nobody has any idea who killed him ? " " Apparently not , or if they do they 're still keeping it under their hat . " He leaned his head way over , looking at Mickelsson . Garret 's hair and shoulders were white with snowflakes . " Worst part of it is , it was apparentlysomeone the Warrens knew . I forget the details . The girl was away at the time , visiting her parents or something . Mabel can tell you the parts I 've forgotten . Husband was alone in the apartment , let in the murderer , apparently had a chat with him , and so forth and so on . You 'd think the police could solve a thing like that . " He shook his head . " Awful , " Mickelsson said . " Let him did you say ? " " Hint , her , them . . " He thought of asking if it were true that the man was homosexual , then decided against it . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the lobby behind them the lights flicked on and off . Mickelsson putp256the palm of his right hand over the pipebowl , the palp of his left thumb over the hole in the stem . " I meant to ask you , " he said as they went in together , following the crowd , " I 'm having a little party December twelfth , Friday . Do you think you and Mabel could make it ? " " I 'll ask her , " Garret said , smiling . " Off-hand , it sounds great . " " Nothing fancy , " Mickelsson said , waving his pipe . " Just a few friends . " As they rejoined the group at the auditorium door , Edie Bryant was saying , smiling , her wattles shaking like fringe , " Well , Jessie , there they are , two people sharing a talent . I 'll grant them that . Now , Phil and I , we 're as diffrunt as night and day . Outside the sanctuary of the bedroom , all is war . " She winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw a little to put on more dignity . Tom Garret , arms folded over his chest again , looked down at the carpet , grinning to himself . " Phil , " Mickelsson said , " and Jessica , I wanted to ask you this too . " He took her elbow . " I 'm having a little party on December twelfth ; that 's a Friday . If you 're free that night and you 'd like to come  --  " Jessica smiled as if wonderfully surprised and pleased but drew her arm away . For reasons Mickelsson did n't fully think out , the second half of the concert annoyed him much less than the first . He could have found reasonsenough , of course . There was the distraction of Jessica 's emphatic coolness beside him , as if he 'd somehow insulted her  --  whether by leaving her for a smoke outside , or by showing too little respect for Art , or by some other mistake , heaven knew . In any event , the discomfort she caused him made the music seem comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzlement , wordlessly asking for explanation ; and though she did n't see fit to explain to him , she did at least partly relent , patting his hand , then returning her own hand to her lap and resting it with the other . And part of his increased appreciation , no doubt , had to do with the effect of the music on the Blicksteins ' young friend . She listened with such a rapt expression  --  head lifted , one diamond ear-ring shooting off needlesharparcs of colored light  --  that it occurred to him to wonder if perhaps the young woman was herself a musician , hearing things inaudible to the common ear . He made a greater effort to feel what the others were feeling . Ile began to nod , furtively tap his toes inside his shoes , raise his eyebrows in appreciative surprise , smile when those around him smiled . Once he turned his attention to it , the whole idea of using " serious " modern musical devices ( " tone rows , " " clusters , " whatever musicologists would call all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mickelsson knew nothing about the details of music . For all his Lutheran heritage and his father ' special love of singing , he himself hadp257never been musical , as a child ; in fact he could n't carry a tune . Not that he had n't made efforts to inform himself ; part of his game was writing articles in aesthetics . He 'd read an occasional book a life of Mahler , another of Berlioz , the memoirs of Shostakovich . But he would hardly have ventured an opinion on Mahler , Berlioz , or Shostakovich in the company of musicians . Yet for all that , as he listened to the Swissons ' music he began to develop a theory . The devices Britt Swisson used in his compositions were mainly of the kind an ordinary , uneducated listener ( like Mickelsson ) would describeas " noise " ; discord , scrambled rhythms , an occasional little passage of what might have been jazz , another that might have been the slightly " off " thumpings and poopings of a German town band  --  passages leading nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music " properly speaking as fragments of sound , glittering objects from civilization 's music dump . Surely these devices had entered the vocabulary of contemporary music in the first place ( he reasoned ) because they gave expression to feelings left unsatisfied in the rhythmic , melodic , and harmonic tradition descended from , say , Bach and the eighteenth century . ( It was true that in philosophical circles the emotion/expression theory of art had been taking quite a beating lately ; but Mickelsson 's money , despite the current fashion , was on Collingwood and his gang . ) And surely those unsatisfied feelings the loss , alarm , paranoia , and vulgar passion in modern music  --  were none other than the emotions the Enlightenment repressed : the universal or at least very common human sense of vulnerability , encircling chaos , cosmic indifference . Discord and noise , in other words  --  bits of musical chaos partially ordered by the composer but allowed to stand as chaos , uncancelled or reformed Being in the rift  --  were the musician 's expression of the godless , all-but-universal modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped of its comforting illusions . It was fitting , it struck him now , that Kate Swisson should have said to him , all righteous sobriety , " Britt and I do n't believe in ghosts " ; but also it was the usual modern bullshit , for what was the meaning , intentionalor otherwise , of Swisson 's comic use of devices invented out of fear and anger if it was not mockery of the devices by misapplication , to demonstrate , by mimicking them , how childish they were in their existential wail  --  to reveal diem , without mercy ( but also with no hard feelings ) , as theatrical rant and hand-wringing ? Once all pretensions to tragic grandeur were clashed , once the very scream of " the ungodded sky " was shown for what it was , a self-regarding ll'aa , what could be expected but  --  what else was possible than -- a return to good humor , classical sociability in place of the Romantic yawl ) ? In other words , " Ideals , " as one used to say  --  value assertions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellspring ? ( To say ' ' We do n't believe in ghosts " was an act of trulyp258shocking vulgarity . Who was ever quicker to talk about ghosts than the civilized , the effete genteel , the English ? Only the opposite assertion , " We do believe in ghosts "  --  except if it were said by a madwoman  --  could be more vulgar . ) Little by little Mickelsson came to be so taken by his theory that he began actually to enjoy the music , even its overwrought performance . Tentatively , he smiled , nodding his approval . He knew well enough how Ellen 's theories , many of them published in Modern Drama and The Educational Theatre Journal , could make crap intellectually majestic ; and he remembered how , when they 'd gone to Cornell to decide whether or not Mark should go there , and had visited the conspicuously expensive art museum , Mark had said , looking around at the sculptures , paintings , drawings , and photographs , " Any freshman that comes here would know right away that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art education , he 's not sure anymore . " Mickelsson knew , in other words , how aesthetic theory can steal the wall from the aesthetic object . Nevertheless it seemed to him that his theory of the Swissons ' music was right , not just concept juggling , not just an exercise , on his part , of the age-old human inclination to make peace with even the most outlandish opinions of the tribe . True , it was possible that the stuffiness of the place had mellowed him : audience heat and the scarcity of oxygen made it harder and harder to keep from yawning . And no doubt he 'd been influenced by pity for the Warren woman . It was always tempting to reason away the defects of an essentially benevolent community . Nevertheless he smiled and nodded now  --  even raised and lowered the toes of his shoes with firm commitment . Jessica glanced at him , still reserved , even sulky , but tentativelypleased by the improvement in his attitude . He considered reaching for her hand . The same moment , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie Swisson 's teal-colored shoes , his student Alan Blassenheim . The sight of Blassenheim warmed Mickelsson 's heart almost as a glimpse of his own son would have done . The young man 's dark , soft-looking hair , set off against the stagelights , had purple highlights and a rainbowed halo at the edges . Mickelsson was reminded of the half-despairing Jesus in the dust-obscured picture from the workroom floor . It was true , he reflected ; Blassenheim was a classic case : the desperate good boy , eager to please , lifted up beyond the physical now , devoted to the Best , whatever in the world the Best should prove to be . His devotion alone witnessed to its existence . Perhaps it was the same with his son . Ah , the pity ! With all one 's heart one longed to give young people the key to it all , but . . . He saw in his mind the blackened wooden cheesebox and its cargo of rustpitted , hundred-year-old keys , keys once so precious that someone had actually buried them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawn . Blassenheim had his head turned , apparently cons ( ions that NIickelssonwas behind him . Mickelsson bowed ; I ( MSS the intervening rows with evuaverated uxiability.  |p259Automatically  , when the song ended and the applause began  --  he could n't remember a single note of it  --  Mickelsson joined in . " Cheer up , " Jessica said in his ear , possibly meaning to injure  --  her scent rushed to his heart  --  " it 's almost over . " " I like it , " Mickelsson said . " They 're very good . " She gave him a sidelong , utterly inscrutable look . He smiled , clapping on , thinking about her anger and the scent of her perfume , distinct , yet too subtle to identify with any earthly flowers , landscape , weather ... . Kate Swisson bowed and bowed , left , right , center , smiling at the studentsin the front row . Alan Blassenheim , broad-shouldered , handsome as a latter-day Hercules or Apollo , clapped with his hands above his head , like a Greek dancer . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mickelsson glanced at his watch and thought , mistakenly , that it had stopped . The clinking of the piano suggested one of those dread-filled moments in a horror film , or an awesome shot in a space-buster , star sparks plummetingtoward the camera . With a wild look of either madness or terror , Kate Swisson wailed in Sprechstimme , " In the timelessness , the spacelessness of heaven , after 33,000 performances of Handel 's Messiah , I cried out . In utter desperation I forced my way through masses of bodiless spirits that surrounded the throne . There was a clamor of voices , all wanting to get out . I was not alone ! " Mickelsson laughed . Very clever ! Interesting ! Not at all with the intention of sleeping , he closed his eyes and slept . He dreamed he had a long , friendly conversation with his wife . The dream was in vivid color , and his wife wore a dress decorated exactly like a wedding cake , sugar-white , as blinding as snow on a sunny , cold day . Her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of friends , as close as two children together , and everything in the dream was filled with light , rich and surprising , like morning to a very young child . The village where they found themselves had brown streets , bright yellow and red flowers in winclowboxes , and red brick houses like those in a young child 's picturebook . I lc heard her say clearly , with such sweetnesshis heat %vent light with joy , " ' This way , Mick . " She lifted off the ground , flying like a candied angel on a string . I le too began to fly , but then , high above the lovely pit tttrelmtok world , he suddenly realized that he 'd lost the trick of it.  |p260He  jerked awake , reaching out to catch himself , and looked around , startled , crushed inward by the auditorium 's darkness , though the dreamvoicewas still in his ear . To his outer , merely fleshly ear , Kate Swissonsang , in her overly meticulous , phoney way : " But there 's nothing here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , of toil and tears and human suffering . Look here , there is an opening for a blackunemployed , unskilled , uneducated laborer , who will go from job to job , from booze to drugs , from woman to woman .... " There was a pause , a rising melodic phrase on the piano , and then : " Halleluyah ! I 'll take it ! ' God smiledand I was born again . " With a tavern-piano glissando and three funky chords , the concert ended . The people around Mickelsson clapped and clapped , some of them shouting " Bravo ! Brav-i ! " or whistling . He saw Gail Edelman , in an aisle seat to his left , lean forward with shining eyes , clapping and nodding . She was dressed in light blue , like a highschool girl , and had on rouge and lipstick . Alan Blassenheim and his friends , then some older people , stood up and clapped with their hands in front of their faces . He saw that the Rogerses , Garrets , and Tillsons were standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , brushing the seat of her skirt as she rose . Mickelsson rose too . " Brav-o ! " Jessica 's eyes were shiny , glinting . " Brav-o ! " Mickelsson shouted , cupping his mouth , then clapped harder , cupping his hands to get maximum noise . In the lobby , afterward , pressed against the wall , out of the crowd 's mance . " " Me ? " Mickelsson said gruffly , " What romance ? " Garret pointed , the ceiling lights blanking out his glasses as he did so , and when Mickelsson turned to look he saw his student Alan Blassenheimwith his arm around the waist of the class nihilist  --  as he 'd thought her once  --  Brenda Winburn . Blassenheim was laughing , holding forth to those around him , gesturing with his free right hand and ann . Ile looked grown-up tonight ; successful young lawyer or politician . Brenda 's eyes were hooded , her expression unreadable , yet their could be no denyingp261that her own right arm was clinging to Blassenheim 's waist as if for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at his forehead , one saw that there was definitely something going on . If the smile made her beautiful  --  changed her completely  --  no one was quicker to notice than Blassenheim , pulling his chin back , grinning and widening his dark brown eyes as if Brenda Winburn were his personal creation and now , watching her , he were amazed at how he 'd outdone himself . Mickelsson said , " They 're in my class together , if that 's what you mean . " " The way I hear it , " Garret said , his smile going up into both plump cheeks , " you practically commanded the thing . Is n't that the truth , now ? " Again his glasses became silver blanks . Mickelsson glanced at Jessica , who smiled , reserved . Damn stiff-necked bitch , he thought . In her shadow , Mabel Garret , ancient and elfin in her drab black dress , was looking at Mickelsson with an expression so clouded and unfriendly that a shiver ran up his back . He glanced at Garret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You old yenta , " Garret said , smiling on and clamping a hand on his arm . Then he too saw his wife 's expression , and his smile went as blank as his glasses . Michael Nugent 's face emerged from among the others , staring hard at Mickelsson , as if harboring some grudge . His face was so white it looked as if he 'd powdered it . Belatedly , Mickelsson raised his hand to wave , but Nugent had disappeared , fading like a fugitive back into the press . " Well , " Jessica began , unaware of whatever it was that was going on with the Garrets  --  but that moment Tillson broke in on them . He had his short , big-bosomed wife in tow , her face triangular , sad-eyed , longsuffering , at the moment bravely smiling . Tillson firmly gripped Mickelsson'shand , his silver-bearded head thrown forward , his grin and eyebrows twitching . " Wonderful concert ! " he piped , shaking Mickelsson 's hand as if Mickelsson were responsible . Then , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to shake Phil Bryant 's hand . " Wonderful concert ! " he cried , and gave his head a sharp sideways snap . Bryant smiled vaguely . " Interesting poem , that last , " he said , but Tillson did n't hear , swinging his face around toward Jessica and crying , " Shall we try to catch the Swissons for a drink ? " " I do n't know , " Jessica said . She gave Mickelsson a look , then turned quickly back to Tillson : " Yes , let 's " Mabel Garret said , with her usual madwoman abruptness , " We have to go home . ' font can meet you if he wants to . " She gave a quick , shy smile . " All those kids , you know . " " Oh ! " Nirs . Tillson said the first thing she 'd said to any of them  --  " I 'm so sorry ! " She pressed her hand to her heart . " I 'd hoped  --  " Tillson leaned in , nodding urgent agreement ,  |p262Mabel  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " do n't go home tonight . Stay with someone in town . " " What ? " Jessica said . Mickelsson waited . Something had happened inside his ears ; perhaps he was hearing the roar of his own blood . " I have this feeling , " Mabel said . " What do you mean ? " He grinned but raised his fist to his chest , pressing in , having a little difficulty with his breathing . " I do n't know . " She suddenly laughed and raised her hand to her eyes . Tom Garret leaned into the group to look up at Mickelsson . " Her hunches are sometimes uncanny , Pete . " When Mickelsson looked back at Mabel , she was already turning , fixing the shoulder-strap of her large , lunky purse and moving off quickly , fleeing her friends ' attention . " Are you all right , Peter ? " Jessica asked . " I just think I 'll get a drink of water , " he said . Two hours later , after food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firehouse Five  --  the Swissons saying no more than two words to anybody there , even Edie Bryant  --  and after dropping off Jessica with a kiss on the cheek ( " Thanks , Peter ! " " No , no , thank you , " both of them feeling , it seemed to him , like traitors , though he could n't make out even now where it was that the evening had gone awry )  --  Mickelsson , driving up the windingmountain road , just escaped being slammed into a ditch by a dark , expensive-looking car . For all the speed with which the car came at him  --  barrelling straight down the middle of the road , headlights undimmed , blindingly lighting up the snowfilled night  --  for one violent , ephemeral instant as the two cars slid crazily around each other , nearly overturning , Mickelsson saw in the beams of his headlights the face of the driver who 'd nearly killed him . Fists clenched at the top of the steeringwheel , her ashen face thrown forward toward the windshield , almost striking it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasant woman who 'd sold him his house , " the doc . " He stopped the Jeep as soon as he was able ; but whatever was at her heels gave the doctor no quarter : her taillights shot away down the mountain road , around sharp , falling corners , under overhanging limbs , then plunged between stone banks and trees and was suddenly out of sight.  |p263He  was too upset to sleep . Every time he closed his eyes he saw again those sudden , blinding lights in the curtain of white flakes , slicing out of nowhere , less like a car than like a speeding UFO , and he felt again that sickening yaw of weightlessness as the jeep snowplowed sideways , climbing leapinglike a wolf  --  up the wall of the high , soft snowbank and stones underneath , teetering , tilting far over as if to topple , then righting itself . The other car too had gone sideways up onto the snowbank , rolling part way over onto the door of the driver 's side , sending out an arc of white glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the metal caved in , the headlights aiming down , his own aiming straight , from slightly above , at her windshield . It felt to Mickelsson like the whole spin-out of his life reduced to one timeless instant  --  his financial ruin , his sick infatuations , his self-destructive smoking and drinking , his professional collapse ... He stripped to his underwear to lift weights for a while . That often helped , at times like these . Partly it helped his ego ; in more concentrated fashion than his work on the house , weight-lifting kept the middle-aged thickness of trunk mostly muscle , burning away the gin fat ; kept his arms and thighs toned up , free of undue flab or , worse , plain old-folks ' - home weakness . And then too , there was the drug effect , better than any gin or marijuana in the world : sucking in air , swallowing great gulps right to the bottom of the abdomen , bending and , with a loud cry of hop , lifting , holding , and after a quick shift of balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came quickly , and then almost as soon , the human morphine that shut it off . Human morphine , hyperventilation , the bestial sense of steadily increasing goon power  --  what could beat it ? He felt he could kick down trees , drag elephants by the tail . He lay off for a while , puffing , swinging his arms , rolling his shoulders to quiet the muscle spasms . He wiped sweat off his hands , face , and neck with the rag , vigorously rubbed his scalp and the back of his neck , then squattest for perhaps two minutes , closing his eyes . It was a good thing , keeping the old corpse in shape . ' Fended to encourage non-violence . He 'd said once to Ellen 's friend The Comedian , " I 've got half a mind to break you in hall . " " I do believe you have half a mind , " The Comedian had said , blinking slowly , grinning one.sidcdly in his panic , ' ' ail I see you alsop264have the muscles . " Almost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at someone else , Mickelsson had laughed . He stood up again , loosened up the machinery  --  his whole body was soaking wet  --  and went back to it . After half an hour more he quit again , this time for good , rolled the weights back into their corner with his foot , then went into the bathroom , rinsed out the sweat rag , and showered . When he finished he found that even now he was n't ready to face bed , so he put on his glasses and bathrobe and began wandering through the house barefoot , unconsciously opening and closing his paintbrush- and hammer-calloused hands , looking at objects as if he found them unfamiliar : the brushed steel face and knobs of the tuner and amplifier he never used  --  he switched them on , then immediately off again  --  the junk furniture he 'd gotten to tide him over ; magazines on the coffeetable , not a magazine in the stack that he would actually read without a gun at his head , except maybe The New Yorker for its cartoons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . He picked up the top New Yorker on the pile to check but then stopped , seeing again the whitened face behind the windshield sliding past him , crazily listing ; and again he wondered , his skin crawling , what could have so frightened her ? Where had she been ? With regard to the second question , where she 'd been before he 'd met her on the road half a mile below his house , the possibilities were not exactly rich . She could have been coming from here , his place , formerly hers , or she could have been coming from somewhere farther up the slope , or ( less likely ) somewhere beyond , the other side , deeper in the backwater wilderness of ridges , high lakes , and fog-bound valleys . He 'd driven up to the top several times , exploring , back in early Septemberand October , and he 'd tried a number of the back roads through valleys suddenly opening out behind , dirt roads descending quickly and recklessly , like spring-fed creeks . He 'd seen very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was doubtful that she 'd come from much farther . A trailer or two , with immense woodpiles and jitneys in the yard , dark mongrel dogs that came out to yip and howl in indignation as you passed ; here and there small tarpapered houses in the woods , no electric lights in most of them  --  places taken over long ago by squatters : shy , wolfeyedpeople , watchful and still as bears as your car cruised by ; and here and there he 'd made out big , empty houses like dried-out gray skulls , houses the local children no doubt told stories about , once-grand , nowcrumblingnightmare places , some furniture still left in them , perhaps in summertime the favorite old chair of a rattlesnake . Once , long ago , these high ridges had been farmed . It was hard to believe that it could have been from higher on the mountain that the doctor had . coiue , but the alternative was even snore difficult to deal with , the idea that 1 ight here at Nlickclsson 's house thep265doctor had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again as it invaded his thought he dismissed the idea , then found himself pausing to listen . At last , angrily , hoping to be rid of that feeling once and for all , he took the flashlight from the shelf at the head of the cellar stairs and searched the house inside and out . There was nothing to be found . He poured himself a drink , but after one sip discovered that his stomach was too sour to put up with it , and poured the remainder down the sink . His mind was still weird from the weight-lifting , catching movementsthat were n't there , at the periphery of his vision . At last , one by one , taking his time , he turned the lights off he 'd turned on every last lightin the place , even the watchlights on the barns and with no light remainingbut the lamp on his bedtable , he shrugged off his bathrobe , then picked off his glasses , pausing once to listen as he did so , his brow deeplyfurrowed listening not only with his tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fingers . Then he crawled meekly under the covers , turned off the lamp , and lay belly up with the back of his head on his hands , elbows out , keeping his ears free . He stared at the pitchdark ceiling as if he had no intention whatever of going to sleep . In the valley the 3 a.m. train went by . He listened as it sang along glens and cliffs , sliding eastward toward New York City , a huge , humming , dark-iron snake . Once there had been glowing-steel passenger trains on this line , rushing yellow windows . No more . He thought of New York 's lights , not many of them now , cavelike alleys , tombstone-dark buildings . The train must be a hundred cars long . Lonesome sound , as the folksongs liked to say . How empty it made the night !  --  alas , an emptiness not just physical . Peter Mickelsson was no longer a child on the Wisconsin farm , cows scattered like old gray boulders across the moonlit pasture , hushed with rumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his childhood had jokingly spoken of its doing eyes glittering , as if merry  --  had poured the magic out of the world like well-water from a dipper . For him as for all those country songwriters and weary black blues-singers , not to mention high-class tragic poets of former times and places  --  Greece , Japan , China  --  or brooding philosophers , Diogenes in his barrel , Marcus Aurelius knee-deep in chickens , Boethius in jail  --  the day had come when suddenly the obvious goodness of life , the splendor in the grass , innocence of eye and ear were vanquished , gone as if they 'd never existed , like Occident light from a Stoic 's leaded window or spirit from a father 's blue eye . I low did human beings go on after such things  --  family deaths , ruin , the collapse of marriage with a woman once loved ... . It was unthinkable that nothing could be clone about it . That was why Ellen and her friends had despised hint , its Sal ) Francisco . They would sit " rapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor and on the lower teat Iles of the furniture , or flung like sated jackals on the lawn in back , dteatning up grand schemer to make the wotid a softer place . I hep266would bait them with Nietzsche : " The wish to eliminate suffering is the wish to eliminate life , " and , " Pain is a good part of what holds societies together . " He would mockingly suggest  --  but he meant it more seriously than they knew  --  that they 'd misunderstood human nature . " You 've forgotten about Schadenfreude , " he said  --  he loved pulling fancy language on them , dropping it casually , as if any half-educated fool ought to know the term . One of her friends , a tall , black-bearded young man named Vince , was particularly offended by all he said and stood for . " Far out ! " he would say , looking up-from-under with foggy blue eyes , maybe trying to focus his minotaur-bulky shape . " Like , man , how can you go to , like , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home horrified by the cowshit all around you ? " From the darkness of the lawn beyond where Vince sat came a faint , weary chorus of yeah 's . Ellen said nothing . " Art makes heavy the thinking man 's heart , " Mickelsson said . " Nietzsche . " He might easily have used Nietzsche in their defense , of course  --  for instance his idea on the imposition of form and order as a cause of suffering but the temptation to defend was not strong . The night in which they plotted and grieved over the oppressed was ironically sweet and still . The house looming against the stars was grandly Victorian , pre-fire ; it was on the other side of Twentieth Street that the smaller , newer , though equally shabby buildings began . To the left of the house from where they lay in the yard ( or , in Mickelsson 's case , stood ) an immense old evergreen pointed darkly at the moon . " Do n't you have something to do , Peter ? " Ellen asked . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt forces in the Establishment , Ellen 's friends now scorned the use of reason , scorned self-analysis , even rational self-defense . They would not talk , would only sneer or attack , bully both their enemies and each other . In their filthy little playhouse , ex-Protestant church  --  walls of black , a few spotlights , tape-recorder , old cracked folding-chairs for the audience  --  Vince and a black called Errol appear on a coolly lighted set which consists of a lamppost , a wheelbarrow , and a mirror , the two of them in shabby clothes , Vince ( tall , bearded , with knobby knees and elbows ) leaning on the lamppost , center stage , Errol pushing the wheelbarrow around and around him , for no apparent reason . Occasionally , Vince looks in the mirror ; he will not let Errol look . Sometimes they do the play with words ( mostly obscenities ) , sometimes as mime . Vince ( this is the play ) hates the audience . When he uses words he calls them " dumb mashedpotatofuckers , " " wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et cetera . ( Vince has a flair for the vividly vile . This does not necessarily make hint likeable . ) Errol begins in agreement with Vince , gradually shifts to preferring the audience to Vince , decides to abandon the stage . Vince willp267not allow it . Errol has always been on the stage , and the audience is a bunch of et cetera , et cetera . Errol slips off his boots and makes a dash to join the audience ; Vince shoots and kills him . ( The death is frighteningly convincing . ) The End . When the performance goes well , the audience feels insulted , financially and artistically cheated , hurt , diddled with , confused ( What does it mean ? What is the symbolism of the mirror ? Who is Vince ? ) , sickened and enraged . Does the play raise the social consciousness of the audience ? Who knows ? Sometimes the troupe barely escapes alive , and this , Mickelsson sees plainly , begins to be their kick . One day , not long after Geoffrey Stewart , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imitation of Jesus Christ , " Ellen 's crazies see , by whatever epistemological means it may be that convince them , that they must work not on middle-class audiences but directly on the oppressed . The ordinary black on the street must learn to let it all hang out , quit repressing , stand up and shoot . San Francisco street theater is born . They put on whiteface , wear odd costumes : a fat , rich Wall Street banker 's attire , the kosmoi of a wealthy , aristocratic lady ( cigarette holder  --  Ellen 's , ironically  --  and lorgnette ) ; they go up to gentle , ordinary blacks who are minding their own business , maybe walking the kids in Golden Gate Park , and the actors engage the innocent victims in improvisational dialogue . There are flowers everywhere , the smell of new-cut grass on the rolling lawns between , eucalyptus trees , the smell and soft wind of the Pacific . " Hey , nigger !

" They move in on him . He knows this foolishness better than they do , these high-assed kids with their mission and their expensive acting lessons . His grandfather was a make-'em-sweat preacher in Georgia : " You ! Sinner ! You wid dat bottle ! " The black man in the suit and tie , holding his two children 's hands , knows the game .

The at tors and actresses are ecstatit . The street play has begun ! If they 're lucky , pun ( he s will ensue , people will tluow stones at them . Mickelsson , sick with disgust and pity , lades back into the crowd.  | " Why do you stay married to her ? " a friend had asked  --  Carol , a female grad student in poly sci at Berkeley , whom he 'd often talked with over coffee or sitting on the grass by the library ; nothing heavy , though both of them had thought about it . " I keep hoping it 's just a passing phase , " he said . She looked at him , waiting in the soulful , non-directive Rogerian way that had been popular at the time . " And then there 's the fact that we 've got kids , " he said . She nodded . " I keep pretending it 's not happening , " he said , and ruefully smiled . " I rarely see their performances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this one 's probably exceptional . " " Sounds like they all are . " He nodded , looking down . He loved her large , solid knees . He had been right at least that with Ellie it had been just a passing phase . Today she lived in a mansion of sorts and gave tea-parties . If she directed or produced a play , it was The Seagull or Krapp 's Last Tape . She was no longer one of those who struggle against the way of the universe , the unalterable outward drift of wreckage , the greenhouse effect here on this one piece of junk  --  the irreversible rise of CO in the atmosphere , the accelerating transformation of everything on earth to rot . " Betrayed ! " her actors cried now , without hope , shaking their well-trained , long-fingered hands up at the spotlight . Perhaps in a deeper sense she was still up to her old tricks , drugging the world with beautiful might-have-beens .

She 'd been young , happy , travelling far and wide with her handsome tree-scientist  --  today Nigeria , tomorrow some committee of the United States Senate and now all at once , reluctantly , she was surveying with her nervous , flashy eyes the paunchy host of bachelors and cast-offs for some arm not unduly unpleasant to lean on as she drifted toward declining beauty , old age .

" Nietzsche for nihilism transmuted , " the new way to Yes . " He turned his head to look down the hallway through the partly open door , trying to penetrate the darkness . In a kind of waking dream he seemed to hear voices , two of them . Not really voices ; sounds of some kind . He could not make out words . It was queer , those voices , or voice-like sounds  --  possibly some taut wire picking up a radio signal . It was  --  Tom Garret 's word  --  uncanny . Except that no , it was not uncanny , that was an exaggeration . One could make it uncanny by thought , make it like one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hidden in his desk  --  but he refrained . Again , suddenly , so vividly that he might have been dreaming it , he saw lights coming at him , lighting up the trunks and lower branches of trees on each side of the road 's banked shoulders . He sat up straight in the bed , head rammed forward . It filled his windshield , seemed to fill his very skull with whiteness , rushing him like a blinding burst of water down a flume in the California mountains , and he felt again in his stomach and chest the sickening sideways sweep of the car in its miraculous , high-speed , roaring do-si-do around the doctor 's . He wiped his forehead and lowered himself onto his back again . " Better get some sleep , " he told himself gruffly . He took a deep breath and closed his eyes . When he opened them again , it was quarter after three . Was it possible that only fifteen minutes had passed since the last time he 'd looked at the luminous dial on his wristwatch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loan just before Mickelsson had left . It was certainly too late to get up and phone Jessica . That was what he wanted to do , all right  --  tell her what had happened as he was driving home , not just the near-accident but also who it was that had been hurrying so , in the middle of the night , coming down the mountain from God knew where . It would be a comfort to puzzle with Jessica over Mabel Garret 's seeming foreknowledge of the event  --  a strange woman ; he 'd always thought so . He rolled his head on the pillow . At the first thought of Jessica , his penis had begun to stiffen . " You 're not a well man , " Rifkin had said . Mickelsson thought : You should see me now , Doctor . He put his hand on the erection , encouraging it . Jessie , Jessie , Jessie . All right , it was not just comforting talk he wanted of her . He wanted her naked here beside him , or under him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly beautiful body with the clothes stripped away , imagined her kneeling over hint , glistening , the full breasts filially revealed , dangling above him , the collarbone like wings , the perfect wet mouth , gray eyes like Homeric seas . As it she were really their he felt her lowering herself onto him , then felt himself coming , Ur clutched the sheet to the mess and , overwhelmedp270by disgust and gloomy wretchedness , shifted to the edge of the bed , where it was dry . As always when he 'd made imaginary love to her , what he felt now was not relief but shame and revulsion . If any man had ever been truly in love , he thought , he , Peter Mickelsson , was in love with Jessica Stark . ( Rhetoric ; bullshit . Could nothing stop the Thespian antics of the mind ? ) But he was thinking : he understood now the agonies of the silly courtlylovepoets , moaning and groaning over the holy unattainable . Or Nietzsche hopelessly mooning over Cosima Wagner . It had n't been like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been handsome then , or anyway , well-built ; he 'd thought highly of himself . Now he was gross , a proven failure , with no place to go but further down . ( Bullshit , bullshit . ) Thoughts crowded his head , as if to show more plainly his depravity . Always concepts , opinions , past history and books between himself and things . He thought of the whole absurd courtly-love scheme , and its Platonism : how the lover was the poor hopeless worm , writhing , writing verses in secret , hungering for the divine , and how the lady , if he was lucky , came to him like God , with grace . It was true  --  the misery of the lover , at least . All the rest was changed . The lady might pity him . He 'd seen signs tonight that if he played his cards right she might sleep with him , though her reserve , even wariness , was hard to miss . She was no starry-eyed kid . Paradise , everlasting joy . . . Women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . He had nothing to offer : big , maybe dangerous animal . In the end  --  and it would n't take long  --  he 'd be discarded . If he loved her less , that might be tolerable . ( Something phoney in that thought too . He would refuse to notice . ) If one were young and stupid , blindly optimistic .. . Idly , bending his anger around to where perhaps it would do most good , he thought of suicide . It made a certain kind of sense , theoretically . He longed every day for his old life with Ellen , especially when he remembered her as she 'd once been ; but that was over , wrecked , and in a way he was n't sorry : with Ellen , or with those casual pick-ups at conferences , he 'd never have experienced the pure pig sexual joy he 'd found in Donnie Matthews  --  nor would he have met Jessica Stark . No magazine fold-out showed the likes of that lady sociologist  --  such was his opinion  --  and if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way his soul demanded  --  if he could not own her absolutely , grow old with her , be loved by her without a trace of reservation , as if he were spiritually of equal worth . . . He jerked his head , fighting the everlasting sick rush of thought . He would not kill himself , not because he was cowardly but because , like an old bull standing in a field among flies , he did n't give a shit . He breathed deeply , listening to the wheeze fruit- too much smoking , then again thought of Mabel Garret 's precognition , or hunch . I le frowned ,  |p271turning  over onto his side and staring deep into the darkness down the hall , eyes unblinking , trying to decide whether or not he believed in hunches . He believed in his grandfather 's hunches , certainly . Odd that one could believe the particular case but doubt the principle . Perhaps as he and Jessica discussed these things , he could edge her toward what it was that had gone wrong between them , an evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to him . In his mind he again saw her slipping her shoe off , sitting on her foot . He thought again , with a sinking feeling , of Donnie Matthews . Shabby business . He was troubled now by the realization that had come to him the last time he 'd been with her , that she felt for him more than she admitted to herself . Only a few days ago the realization would have filled him with joy . He saw again in his mind her sweet , childish pout  --  something slightly common about it , something studied studied before a mirror , no doubt ; modelled on the pout of someGrade B actress . He moved his right hand to cup his penis and testicles . As if she were there in the bed beside him , he smelled her scent , partly from a bottle , partly sweat . How strange it was when one compared it with the tastefully expensive scent of Jessica Stark !  --  yet even the dim memory of Donnie 's scent had the power to stir in him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joiner of the unjoinable ! He thought of Kurten 's theory of Neandertal extinction and closed his eyes . He closed his hand around his cock and moved the hand slowly . Poor Blassenheim ! Poor Brenda ! Without wishing to , invaded , though he glared and shook his head against it , he thought of the Swissons , the Garrets , the Bryants , finally the Tillsons saw them all in his mind 's eye so sharply it was as if theywere there in the room with him , gathered like visitors at a sickbed . As if hunting for something , or alerted to danger , he looked carefully from couple to couple , still moving his hand . The Swissons , shyly smiling exactly together  --  except that the woman 's smile was less shy than the man 's , as her handshake was stronger , and the man , hard as they played at their game , cared more in the end about music than the woman did ; one could see it in the trouble-lines fencing in his eyes . He thought of driving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ticktickedon . Parts mixed unequally ... They were doomed ; he knew it as surely as he knew his name . The Garrets . He could form no definite opinion about the Garrets . Good people , certainly  --  ten adopted children ; and Tom was always , in his mild , Southern way , a man of liberal concern . ( Mabel he would take from behind , up the anus . Ile drove the vision out , disgusted . ) Strange pair : Tom , genteel aristocrat turneel into a liberal verging on radical and living up here in the land of deep snow , with tell young children of a variety of races , married to a secretive , maybe psychic Russian Jew . One could make a life , of course , of strange ingredients . Nevertheless , it was indeed veryp272strange . He had a feeling Jessica , if she should choose to speak frankly , would make short work of them , or at any rate of their chances  --  though why he thought this he could n't say . Of this much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Alan Blassenheim , in Truth , the great rock foundation of everything . It had seemed to him obvious that if one " behaved in accord with what one knew to be true "  --  an expression that had not then seemed puzzling to him  --  one would be safe , for all practical purposes invulnerable . But now he 'd grown confused , like a once-carefree bob-calf come of age . The clearer his thought  --  the more rigorous his categorical distinctions  --  the more angry and confused he 'd grown . It was as if he had stepped out of a room which for the time he 'd been inside it he 'd known to exist , and could now not find his way back to it  --  could n't find it on any map , could n't even find its theoretical justification , its chemical and mathematical possibility in so-called reality . He believed now in systems , an anarchy of truth-systems spinning like the components of independent molecules  --  believed in them intuitively , as he believed in root propositions  --  but he was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabel Garret , old-name Southerner and immigrant 's child . . . ten children of several races , whom they sat up with , perhaps sang Southern ballads to , or Mottel der Operator , perhaps read The Wind in the Willows and Charlotte 's Web . . . They were good people , and he liked them , but at the center of their life lay something that troubled him . He 'd run across a phrase somewhere , Darwin or one of his followers : " The blind daring of Nature 's experiments ... " ( BeetlebrowedNeandertal marrying handsome Cro-Magnon , producing mules , ( lying out ... ) He lost his train of thought . His eyelids were heavy . Perhaps he would sleep after all , except that his cock was huge now , still blindly hunting . Ile mused with some twilit part of his brain on the arrangements of the Itry , utts and Tillsons . The Bryants had been married for thirty-one years , brutally mismatched as they seemed to be . ( Edie had mentioned tonight at the Firehouse Five that their anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadlock and one year to spare , " she 'd said . " Most marriages that last very long are three-legged stools . " The Swissons , holding hands , had looked interested for a moment . ) Perhaps the truth was that the Bryants were n't as badly mismatched as they seemed and seemed to believe themselves . Was Phil really so classy , she really ( with her noble old blood-lines ) so vulgar ? He was a fine shabby dresser and good at quoting poets , especially Shakespeare ; but then , who would n't be after twenty , thirty years of teaching Anguish ? What he really cared about  --  what made his checks redden and his voice take on a quaver , what made him jab at the tabletop with a manicured index finger was university scheduling , parking regrtlations , the careless policing of the faculty cafeteria . When his cheeks reddened , Eclic would gently put her hand on his ann . not pausingp273to look at him , dropping not a word from the gently self-mocking monologueshe was delivering to Jessica and the Swissons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scorn , " my little chickadee . " It occurred to Mickelsson now for the first time that perhaps they loved each other . Phil the stunningly handsome young officer , Edie the dazzling Southern belle . Instantly the thought turned in on him and depressed him . He noticed that with the fingertips of his right hand he was feeling the pulse in his left wrist . He moved his right hand back to his crotch . What the Tillsons felt for each other Mickelsson could n't guess . She loved him , all right . ( Now it was Ruth that he imagined coupling with . He imagined her crying out . ) Ruth Tillson was the classic betrayed , stilldotingwife . Every time Mickelsson had glanced at them , the poor bigbosomed , sad-eyed woman was clinging for dear life to her hunchbacked husband 's arm . She never spoke , it seemed , if she were n't sure in advance that he 'd agree . She 'd spoken passionately only once all evening , leaning in toward the red-bowled candle at the center of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flame lit up her face and the cleavage between her fat peek-a-boo tits brightening , dimming , intensifyingthe darkness of the tables , heavy beams , broad old staircase behind her . " Coffee and Coca-Cola , " she said , " will be the ruin of this country . It 's everywhere , you know . " She pointed at Mickelsson 's pipe . " Are you aware that tobacco is cured in sugar ? " Then she drew back , touching her hand to her cleavage , calming herself . Mickelsson registered as a fact for possible future use that Geoffrey Tillson strongly disapproved of coffee , Coca-Cola , and tobacco . He wondered if Tillson 's mistress had been at the concert tonight , somewhere in the shadows , smiling at her hunchbacked , silver-bearded lover and his pitiful wife , her dear friend . He wondered if she smoked , used sugar . In a moment Mickelsson would be asleep , the erection hunting through the world on its own . The voices he 'd been hearing were now distinctly dream-voices , though the words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach ; and the people he 'd gone with to the Firehouse Five ( he could feel himself falling back from them , easing himself out of the light from the red glass bowl on their table ) were no longer entirely fitting in with the waking world 's ways . Something he imagined Edie Bryant to be saying , when he brought himself awake enough to think about it , turned out to have to do with leaks in numbers , which in turn had something to do with his father 's death . All at once , in this faintly unpleasant half-dream , he heard Jessica laughing . Evidently something had just cancelled every trace of unhappiness in her life . Perhaps her husband was alive after all , had never been dead ; it had all been a casual bureaucratic mistake . Ile began to thrust , against his will , his heart quickening , and exploded inside his dream of her . That instant a duos opened , and the sounds cutting through made hint think of sweetp274Mexican sunlight on clean white tile-and-stucco walls . Mickelsson concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come clear . ( " Wait here , please , " someone said . ) He wiped the sheet on the cold wetness and tried to make out what he was thinking . Then , in the hallway outside his bedroom , he heard breathing , then footsteps , the creak of floorboards . He jerked himself awake  --  fought his way up out of sleep as from drowning and opened his eyes , half sitting up . Even wide awake he felt disoriented , as if he 'd come to himself in a different house . Somewhere downstairs a child was crying . The sound was real , unmistakable , though of course it was impossible that the house should have a crying child in it . He looked around , trying to think how he might prove to himself that he was or was not awake . The crying stopped . The footsteps kept coming , slowly , not at all furtively , the ordinary footsteps of stiff and uncomfortable old age . It was surely not a dream . Just outside his door a hoarse , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A moment later , a bearded old man with red-webbed , milky , near-sighted eyes and no teeth except a few in the front poked his head in at the door . He did not look at Mickelsson or seem to recognize his existence , but peered into an almost empty corner of the room , the corner where Mickelsson had placed an antique hatrack he never used . After a moment , touching his beard and muttering something , as if he 'd made a mistake , had caught himself in a moment of senility , the old man drew his head in and backed out of sight . Mickelsson listened for the sound of the old man 's movement down the hall , but though he strained every nerve , he heard nothing more . At last he realized that , dream or vision , whatever it was , it was over . The old man , if he 'd ever existed , had finished or abandoned his errand long ago.  |p275By  the time Peter Mickelsson reached his office the following morning , the snow had almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , they might have been back in September . Birds ran up and down on the wet , gray-brown lawn outside Mickelsson 's window ; more birds watched from the bare branches , now and then flying down by paths as determinedly straight as guy-wires to join the activity of the birds on the ground or drive a few timid ones treeward . Students walked around in sweaters or light coats unbuttoned down the front . The day warmed more and more . He 'd arrived earlier than he 'd needed to , feeling lively for some reason  --  perhapshis near-accident on the road last night had somehow gotten the old juices flowing and he decided to see if , in the forty-some minutes he had available before class , he could make a small dent in the great pile of unopened mail on his deck . Casually he began to sort through the envelopes , intending to deal first with whatever seemed most urgent . Thus he came upon the letter with the name Bauer in the upper lefthandcorner , and a Florida address . This time he recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd forgotten but " the doc . " According to the postmark , the letter had come nearly two months ago . He opened it . She was planning to be in Susquehanna in late October or early November , she wrote . She had business , a legal matter that he might perhapshave heard about  --  she believed there had been some mention of it in the papers  --  and it had occurred to her that she might perhaps drop in on him in case he 'd run across any problems in connection with the house  --  questions she 'd failed to anticipate , difficulties she , after fourteen years in Susquehanna , might be able to help him resolve . If he wanted her to visit , he should write to her sometime soon at her Florida address . Mickelsson read the letter through again . It was hard to imagine what sorts of " problems itt connection with the house " she had in mind . But on one score at least , the letter telieved him . He had not just imagined seeing her last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( himself and his own car as tell ) from Susquehanna to Montrose . Today , according to his desk calendar , was October 27th . It was apparent , then , that she really had Iteett up at his house , or mnnewhere nearly , and hadp276been frightened by something . Useless to try to puzzle out what could have frightened her , knowing as little as he did . No sooner had he told himself that it was useless than he knew he was mistaken and reached for the phone . He finally got hold of Jessica not at her office but at her house . " Jessica , " he said , " this is Peter Mickelsson . " He put his voice on intense polite . " I hope I 'm not calling you too early ? " There was a pause , then she laughed . " Peter , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing . I was just afraid I might have  --  " He thought about her question , imagining her look , then suddenly , throwing caution to the winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Again she laughed , this time thoughtfully . " First you tell me This is Peter Mickelsson , ' " she said , " and then you ask me , at half past nine in the morning , if you 're calling me too early . You know I get up with the sun . " " I guess I forgot . " He glanced of his watch . " So what is the matter ? " she asked . " It 's really nothing , " he said , and got out his pipe , set it on top of the pile of mail , and began to hunt through his drawers and pockets for matches . " I just need to ask you a question you may possibly know the answer to . Also "  --  he paused , then again took a chance  --  " I need to tell you I had a wonderful time last night . " " Thanks . I did too , mostly . What was the question ? " He stood up to open the file-cabinet drawers and look for matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman I bought my house from  --  was being sued for malpractice ? Do you remember the name of the people suing her ? " Waiting for her answer , he momentarily forgot his hunt for matches . She said , " I do n't think I ever really noticed the name . I could find out , if it 's important . " " Could you try ? " he asked , and , abruptly remembering , returned to his hunt . Jessica asked , " Where are you  --  in your office ? How long do you plan to be there ? " " Another thirty minutes , then I have class . When it 's over  --  it runs for an hour  --  " " I 'll get back to you before that , " she said . " Bye . " " Thanks , Jess , " he said . " I ca n't tell you how  --  " She 'd hung up . Magically , matches appeared in his shirt pocket . He lit one and hurriedlyraised it to his pipe . Sugar , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the big old-fashioned couch in Tillson 's office , how sometimes when you went there Tillson would be lying on it with his shoes off , his hand on his forehead in the gesture of some nineteenthp277century heroine . With his suitcoat off , his suspenders loose on his white shirt , gray bags under his eyes , so dark one might have imagined he had lupus , he looked like a doll that had been meant to be comic , one of those apple- or potato-people , but had somehow come off unfunny , obscurely depressing , Rumpelstiltskin not destroyed by his own anger but merely beaten , dwindling toward old age . Five minutes later Jessica called back . " Hi . Listen , the name of the girl who died was Deborah Vliet , but the people who are suing are her parents . Her maiden name was Sprague . " When Mickelsson said nothing , she said , " Hello ? " " I 'm here , " he said . " I guess you caught me off guard . Sprague 's the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she echoed ; then , remembering : " Oh , that . Mickelsson , could you possibly divulge what this is about ? " " Tell you when I see you , " he said . " Have to make another phonecall now  --  at least I think I do . You would n't know where these Sprague people live ? " " I imagine with a little detective work  --  " " Never mind , I can do it . " " All right , " she said , less than satisfied . If she was still full of questions , she contained them . " I 'll see you right after your class , OK ? You 'll be there ? " " Sure , " he said . " Good . " By the time he got to good-bye , she 'd hung up . His second call he made to his neighbor John Pearson . The phone rang and rang . Just as Mickelsson was about to give up , the old man answered . He 'd been out in the yard ; something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American-wire fence . When Mickelsson was able to get around to his question , the old man said , " Shore I know where they live . Right up the road about a mile and a half from me . They 're my next-door neighbors except for one place between , Dudaks ' . Course I do n't see much of ' em . Odd bunch . Would n't be suing the doc if they was n't . Tell the truth , I 'm surprised they ever heard about lawyers . But you know how it is . People on Aid know more about lawyers and gettin things for nothin than people like you and me do . " " Sprague does n't work , then ? " " Oh , he works accordin to his lights , I s'pose , " Pearson said . " He 's old . " When it was clear he did n't intend to elaborate , Mickelsson asked , " Do you know if they 're any relation to the Spragues that lived at my place ? " The line h-nn-ned and clicked while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Nlickclsson imagined . At last the old than said , " I s'pose they mist ; - hen . "  |p278For  the first time all semester , Brenda Winburn was talkative that morning , an effect of her romance with Alan Blassenheim , no doubt . Perhaps his admiration gave her the necessary confidence , or perhaps his apparent liking for Mickelsson had seduced her , made her willing to play Mickelsson 's game a little . " Did you see the article in Sunday 's paper , " she asked , " about the brothers who 'd never known each other and were brought to America to be part of a study of identical twins ? " With a nod Mickelsson encouraged her to continue . Though her look was still distrustful , as if prepared for lack of interest , scorn , or ambush from Mickelsson , Brenda continued with considerableease and poise , her hands flat on the desk-chair top , one over the other . Her blond hair was drawn back tightly and tied in a bun , giving her small , almost lobeless ears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre , but today the aliveness of her face  --  the blush of love , one might as well call it . made it difficult to think of her as anything but pretty . " One was named Stohr and the other was named something like Yufe , " she said . " One was raised a Nazi , the other one Jewish . They never saw each other since soon after they were born , but when they met at the airport they were both wearing steel-rimmed spectaclesand double-pocket blue shirts with epaulettes , they both had little moustaches , they both flipped through magazines from back to front and had a habit of keeping rubber bands around their wrists . . . . I forget what else , but the similarities were amazing . " " It 's an interesting phenomenon , " Mickelsson said . He added with a smile , lest he drive her back into her reserve , " I 'm not sure I get your point . " The class , taking its cue from him as always , waited politely . Even Nugent seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face passive , his chin resting on his slightly loosened fist . " Well , I was just thinking , " she said , " maybe when Aristotle was doing all that taxonomy he was aware , to some extent , that things were more set by Nature than his  --  you know  --  moral philosophy admitted . Maybe he just did n't make the connection , I guess that 's possible . But maybe , setting down those different kinds of fishes and crustaceans or whatever  --  maybe he had an inkling that human beings have certain basic natures too , and that "  --  she glanced at Alan Blassenheim  --  " ideas ... all that sort of thing . . . different kinds of actions . . . do n't really count much . Maybe our ideas and philosophies and all ... " She looked down at her hands , calculating whether or not she ought to say it , then looked up and said , " Maybe all that is just cosmetics , if you know what I mean . Sort of just . . . polite behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groom each other . " The class looked from her to Mickelsson . Ile resisted the temptation to take the idea from her and bend it to the purpose of the course . " I 'm not tile I follow the atgument , " he said.  | " It 's not an argument , " she said , suddenly smiling , and shrugged . " It 's just that , for example , this man Stohr , the one that was raised a Nazi , he was one of those Hitler Jugend , if that 's how you pronounce it , and when he was young he saw movies that said Jews were cockroaches and had to be gotten rid of , and then after the war when the Russians captured him and made him look at those pictures of the death camps and things , he felt confused and guilty , and he changed his mind to the same extent everybody else did in that situation  --  he did n't really have any choice at all  --  but in all the important things , like what kind of glasses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickelsson asked , raising his eyebrows . She smiled , alarmed , and waved her left hand . " You know what I mean , " she said . Nugent slid his eyes toward her , scornful , murderously impatient . Blassenheim raised his hand . " I 'm not sure I do , " Mickelsson said , and decided to grant Blassenheimthe floor . " Nobody 's saying that killing people is n't important , " Blassenheim said , and threw a look at Brenda to see if his defense was acceptable to her . " The question is why people do it , or do n't do it , whichever . We talk about people as doing what they do because they think of it as right , or at least , like , expedient . Like Plato 's principle that nobody chooses to do what he thinks will bring him pain . But she 's saying  --  Brenda 's saying  --  maybe that 's wrong . Maybe people choose ideas by style , they just sort of helplessly go with whatever 's in the stores that season  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when they 're dealing with little , more specific styles , like when they choose their clothes , like their shoes and shirts and glasses , that 's more like straight genetic programming . " He sat back and waved his hand , just an interpreter , not committed . Predictably , the class was amused . " You really think blue double-pocketed shirts with epaulettes are programmed in our genes ? " Mickelsson asked . " You know , " Blassenheim said , " maybe not that directly . " He waved again . " Interesting , " Mickelsson said , smiling at Blassenheim as if playing chess with him . They 'd moved a long way from Aristotle , but no matter . " And what does that do , " Mickelsson asked , " to our theory of the Good ? Are moral judgments and aesthetic judgments of the same kind ? Are the Nazi ideal of human nature and the liberal ideal just alternatives of taste ? " Though he addressed the question to Blassenheim , it was Brenda Witihuru who answered . " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " God night have tiles a snake can never figure out . " She leaned forward like a ( laughter ( pleading as if Mickelsson and Reason were stern authorities who could be gotten around by bright eyesp280and a timid smile . As was no doubt the case . " If some genius figures out and tells us about a divine idea but it 's against human nature  --  how people really are , I mean , with all their programmed individual differences  --  itca n't last , he wo n't be accepted . " " Ah ! " Mickelsson said , and raised a finger as if shooting the ceiling , " then in effect the moral absolutes ' "  --  playfully , he put on a German accent  --  " can exist , if at all , only in the actual behavior of human beinks ! " " Not necessarily , " she said at once , narrowing her eyes . " Only the moral absolutes we 're capable of achieving . Maybe that 's why people are so restless and weird . " Mickelsson smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been beaten fair and square . " Well done ! " he said , grinning ; and taking careful aim with his index finger , he shot Brenda Winburn in the nose . Nugent had his hand over his mouth . Mickelsson gathered his books , realizing that he 'd been caught , and , seeing that they were out of time , gave a nod , dismissing the class . As the students were filing out he said to Blassenheim , who stood dawdling , waiting for Brenda to get her pen capped and tucked into the proper compartment of her purse , " It 's not fair , you know , you two ganging up on me like that . " " We did n't really plan it , " the boy said . He stood with his head drawn back a little , smiling uncertainly , as if with part of his mind he would like it to be thought that they had planned it . " Like termites , these students , " Mickelsson said , speaking past the pipe and waving both hands , wiggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then one day you look around and  --  no castle ! " Alan and Brenda laughed pleasantly , as if from a great distance , then drifted toward the door , where Michael Nugent stepped aside for them . Mickelsson saw with a sinking heart that Nugent was waiting to ask some question . " It 's interesting the way you handle class , " Nugent said , walking besideMickelsson as he hurried back to his office . Nugent 's long legs moved oddly , yet with a curious grace , like the legs of a giraffe at the zoo . One hand was pressed hard to his chest as if to stanch blood . " I guess I do n't understand it , exactly , but it 's interesting . " He threw his head forward for a look up at Mickelsson 's face . " I mean , you do n't really say what 's true , really , though you say it in your books . " Mickelsson remembered his intent to put Nugent on to Nietzsche . " Maybe I do n't actually know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nugent waited , floating along beside him with his arms lifted a little  --  he carried no books today  --  his face , at the end of his long , white neck , like the face of an alarmed , sunflower . It crossed Mickelsson 's mind that Nugent 's worsted jacket was exactly like his own.  | " There 's a philosopher I 've been meaning to recommend to you , " Mickelsson said , squinting at the boy . " Friedrich Nietzsche . Your remark about the way I teach our class made me think of it . Like many intellectuals , he had a profound distrust of the uses of intellect , or , as he 'd prefer to say , ' consciousness . ' " Directly ahead of them as they walked down the sidewalk toward the library building , one of Mickelsson 's colleagues , Lawler , the Aquinas man , came tentatively barging , walking straight down the middle of the sidewalk , his nose in a book . Edward Lawler was the soul of oddity : though he was apparently not religious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , five-two at most , and unhealthily fat , balding . The little hair he still had was gray . Like Tillson , their chairman , Lawler never wore anything but black  --  black suits even shabbier than Tillson 's . ( Sometimes , driving past his house , one would see him on his porch steps wearing his bathrobe , reading a book . ) His shirts , on the best of days , had only two buttons left , though it was said that for special occasions he could dress like a prince . Weddings of his most beloved students , funerals .. . " Hello , Edward , " Mickelsson said . Lawler walked on , not looking up . " V'yanna , " he said . God only knew what language it was . Lawler was a master of languages . There was hardly a known one he could n't work out , given time . When they 'd walked a few steps further , Mickelsson looked back . Lawler had stopped , belatedly understanding that someone had addressed him , and stood bowing formally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gnten Tag ! Hi , there ! " Then  --  still without really seeing them , it seemed  --  he waddled on . Mickelsson smiled . " Lawler , " he explained to Nugent . " Brilliant man  --  philosophy . You must work with him sometime . " " I 'm taking his course , " Nugent said . " You signed me up for it . " " Ah ! " Mickelsson said . They walked on . Thinking about Lawler , Mickelsson had completely forgotten now what they 'd been talking about . For all he knew , they might by accident be walking toward the market together  --  except that he noticed that they were heading toward the library building , which fact brought back reality , dimly . " I 'm afraid I forgot what we were saying , " Mickelsson said . Nugent smiled palely and nodded . " We were talking about Nietzsche  --  and our class . " . " Ah yes . " Ile pursed his lips , walking more slowly for a moment . Nugent adjusted his parr . ' Miele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rrn-en-I-ering. playing the odds . " Well , they , were talking about ' nunal absolutes , ' that 's all , " Nugentp282said , " the idea that they 're built into Nature , and so on . Which is a long way from talking about values as human assertions . I guess I thought that girl  --  what's-her-name , the swimmer  --  was sort of on to it , how human beings can see only what they 're constructed to see , and maybe it 's entirelywrong , maybe green is really yellow , in God 's eyes , but since there 's no way human beings can know it , it does n't matter . If our actions are n't informed , they 're not really actions . I was surprised how you handled it , that 's all . " " Yes , right , " Mickelsson said . " Yes , I remember now . I was saying I may not know what I do when I teach . It 's obvious that teaching should be thoroughly rational  --  " He glanced at Nugent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own . " But Nietzsche 's not convinced  --  in certain moods , at least  --  that we 're at our best at our most rational . " He raised his hand , blocking objection . " Let me explain . Think about bodily functions . Imagine what it . would be like if we had to be aware of the breakdown of fats "  --  he glanced again at Nugent , asserting his professorialauthority  --  " that is , imagine how it would be if digestion was something we had to do . Consciousness , Nietzsche would say , has nothing much to do with what 's most efficient in the working of the body . The question , he 'd say , is why consciousness is needed at all . Nietzsche acknowledgesthe phenomenon of consciousness and supposes it developed  --  ' fortunately '  --  only late in the evolution of the human species . In other words , he thinks we 're often better off without it playing it by ear , as they say . That 's not the whole story . It does n't account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , philosopher , or saint . " They 'd come to the library-building doors . Mickelsson held back , letting Nugent enter first . Nugent held back , too , unsure of the rules , then hastily stepped forward . When they were inside , Mickelsson looked around at the door , making sure it was automatically closing , then moved on . He said , " He was a German , of course , and the son of a Lutheran minister , which put him in a good position to see how troublesome strict rationality can be . Still , there 's something to be said for his uneasiness . He has an interesting remark on human language . In general , ' he says "  --  Mickelsson slowed his walk again , smiling his fixed smile , and Nr , ' the back of his right fist to his forehead , striving to get it right , though ne d quoted it a thousand times  --  " in general , whenever primitive man laid down a word , there he believed himself to have made a discovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , and thinking he 'd solved if  --  it goes something like this ; I 'm afraid I 'm paraphrasing slightly  --  thinking he 'd solved it , he in fact only raised an obstacle to its solution . And now , ' Nietzsche says  --  something like this  --  now , with every piece of knowledge , one must stumble over stone-hard , everlasting words  --  and one would rather break a bone than a word . ' " They 'd come to the lust floor 1nen 's room . Mickelsson stopped . " Ip283need to go in here , " he said , and pushed the door open . Nugent nodded and followed . Mickelsson braced up against the urinal , Nugent at his back , and said , " Nietzsche 's whole philosophy  --  like modern positivism , and ultimately like nominalism  --  is based on a deep concern with language . The idea that if you can understand me , I must not be saying much . " With his stream he wrote " P J M " on the cracked white wall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's true , I 'm a little lax in class . I 'm glad to hear my students thinking about anything at all . " He shook his penis , then put it back inside his pants and zipped his fly . " I suppose I 'd have to admit , " he said , " I 'm not very comfortable with undergraduates . ' Certitude is weakness , ' this same Nietzsche says . In undergraduate classes one of the main things we do is offer an illusion of certitude . " He smiled , almost nasty . " It helps the F.T.E. " " I thought that was what you were doing , " Nugent said . Back in his office , Mickelsson partly closed the door , leaving it only an inch or two ajar since Jessica would be coming , she 'd said ; then he went directly to his desk , where he rummaged through the drawers until he located his Susquehanna-Montrose phone book , found the number , and dialed the Susquehanna Hospital . Over the hills outside his window a gray wash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges and the weedy fields below more drab and dingy than they 'd been earlier this morning sickly , in fact , as if infected , mile after mile , with mange . The phone rang six times , seven times , eight . . . . He rechecked the number , thinking it impossible that a phone could go so long ignored in a hospital ; but there was no mistake . He waited on , and at last a friendly , middleagedfemale voice said , " Seskehenna Hospital , Hennessy speaking . " " Hello , " Mickelsson said . Just then his office door swung open and Jessica came in . When she saw that he was phoning , she signalled him to go on , she 'd wait outside , and started to leave , then paused as he waved her toward one of the chairs he had for conferences with students , gave him an inquiring look , then settled gracefully though perhaps not entirely at home there in Mickelsson 's learner 's seat , crossed her legs at the knees , a ' tpped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , meanwhile , " Hello . This is Professor Mickelsson out on RiverviewRoad . I wonder if I could talk to Dr. Bauer . " " I ) r . Bauer ? " the voice said . " We have n't gaht a 1 ) r . Bauer anymore . We used to , but -- - " " I know she 's not with you anymore , " Mickelsson said , " but I understandshe was planning to drop by today . I 'm the man who bought her house front her . " Ile laughed , vaguely like au old friend . " If I could just get in tout h with her if there were someone there who would be likely to know -  " Just a minute , Prafessor . " Blips and buzzes hit his ear , then a husky male voice said with practiced haste and distraction , " Benton . " Now the other voice , the woman 's , sounded miles away . " Dr. Benton , the prafessor that bought Dr. Bauer 's howse is on the line . He 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll talk to him , " Benton said . Then , loudly , as if he distrustedphone-wire , " Hello ? " " Hello , Doctor , " Mickelsson began . Before he could say more , Dr. Benton called out , " Far as I know Dr. Bauer 's down in Florida . If she was n't , I feel pretty sure she'd 've rung me . We used to be partners here . Is it something somebody else could help with ? " " No , " Mickelsson said , and glanced at Jessica . " Is there anybody else she 'd get in touch with if she came up ? " He gave a little chuckle . " Actually , the reason I 'm so persistent  --  I thought maybe I saw her . " There was a pause , three heartbeats . " If she was here , I 'd be the first one to know . " " I see . Well , I 'm sorry to have troubled you . " " No trouble , no trouble a-tall , " Dr. Benton said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her index finger pressing into her cheek , like a professor listening to a not very carefully prepared seminar report , as Mickelsson told her how he 'd nearly been killed , driving home last night , then explained to her the theory that was beginning to take shape in his mind . When he finished , she went on staring for a time at nothing in particular  --  the pipe on the great stack of mail on his desk  --  then gave her head a little shake . She had a wonderfullysharp jaw-line , the handsome , sharp nose and Near-Eastern slanted eyes of the warriors of Darius  --  if one could believe the ancient polychromebrick frieze . He wondered if the ancient Persians had been a tall people . " Strange , " she said . Mechanically , making a comb of her fingers , she pushed a falling sweep of hair back from her temple . After a moment she asked , " But why would she have gone there without telling anyone ? Her friends , I mean . " " I wo n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickelsson said . " Or talked to the Spragues . " He leaned back in his chair , looking at the door above Jessica 's head , aware that she was watching him more sharply now , surprised and displeased by his suggestion . " According to my theory , " he said , " she could n't very well tell her lawyer what she was doing , your friend what's-his-name  --  " " Bob Ceslik . " " That 's it . If she told him , she wanted to make a visit to the Spragues , try to persuade them to settle tine thing privately , he 'd have insisted on going with her , or none likely he 'd have advised her not to go . You knowp285lawyers . As for Benton or any other friends she may have  --  " He paused , casting about . " Maybe she was in too much of a hurry to see them , so she decided not to tell them she was coming . That 's possible , she may have flown up and rented a car at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind you 'd be likely to get at a Hertz or Avis . " He shrugged . " Or maybe , doing what she was trying to do , she felt uneasy  --  secretive . I do n't know ; I have n't thought that part out yet . " Jessica mused . " What I do n't understand is why she was going so fast . No matter where she 'd been  --  at the Spragues ' place or at yours  --  it makes no sense . " Mickelsson smiled . " It would make sense if she 'd been up at my place and seen the ghosts . " She shook her head . " I do n't think so . " She leaned forward in the chair , her head almost level with Mickelsson 's . " I know you 're not even considering the possibility . But just for the sake of argument , suppose that 's what happened . " With a quick , impatient movement of one hand , she waved away objections . " Suppose she went to your place , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found the place dark , or maybe one light on somewhere , up in the upstairs bathroom , say  --  does n't matter  --  something that made her think you might be home . So she got out of the car and went to the door and looked in , right ? And saw something . We do n't have to say it was a ghost . But we know she must have heard the same stories you 've heard . Say she believed them  --  for whatever reason . " She shrugged and again waved away objections . " The point is , no matter what she saw  --  make it the worst thing your mind can conceive . . . I do n't know , some old woman in the kitchen , sawing the body of some old man into pieces  --  " Jessica laughed , startled by the image that had come to her , then hurried on : " She runs back to the car and gets the hell out of there . Flying , right ? But after half a mile , would she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about what she was saying by the image of her earnest face thrown forward toward him , her hands palms up under her chin , level with her collarbone . He imagined her as a schoolgirl , straightening out her drama teacher . " I would n't , " she said , and poked the desktop with her index finger . " I 'd drive like crazy until I knew I was safe , and then I 'd slow down . And if she 'd driven all the way from Spragues ' when she met you  --  whatever it may have been that happened at Spragues '  --  " Mickelsson nodded . " Interesting , " he said . " But if something was chasing her --  " Jessica glanced at him , unpcisuaded but willing to think about it . ' Uteri something else occurred to her . tilw asked , " Why is it you want to talk to her or to the Spragues ? What good will it do ? You want damages for an ate ident that did n't happen ? " " I 'd like co @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " Mickelsson said.  | " You feel threatened ? " She leaned toward him again . " Look , why do n't you just forget it ? Write it off . " He smiled , ironic , unwilling to be bullied . " Maybe that 's it . I feel threatened . " " You feel something weird , Peter . I realize you 're Superman and nothing scares you .... " Again her look sharpened . " Is it the coincidence of the names  --  the Spragues who lived at your house , the Spragues up on the mountain ? " A smile began to form at one side of her mouth . " Some kind of problem in ontology  --  if that 's the word ? " " Maybe , " he said , dismissive , and reached for his pipe . She watched him pick it up , feel into the bowl with his grimy index finger , then put it to his lips . Still with her legs crossed at the knees , she began to swing one leg slowly , as if purposely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's for sure . " She smiled . " You 're a scary lady , " he said , covertly sly , like a poker player . " Maybe all women are . " She shrugged . Foul blow ! Ambushed ! He held a match to the pipebowl to evade her eyes . He decided on frankness , the old nothing-to-hide play . " All right , " he said , " I feel threatened . God knows why . I like order . " " Hmmm , " she said . He could feel her drawing back , preparing a new tack , less like a gambler than like an oral examiner briefly letting up on a student in trouble . " It is interesting that the names are the same , " she said . " I doubt that it means anything , but it 's interesting . I guess I know how I 'd feel , if I were you . Here 's this mystery of ghosts  --  even if you do n't believe in ghosts , it must make you feel odd  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence . I think it would make me feel "  --  she shrugged  --  " as if something were creeping up on me . Make me feel vulnerable . And if I were feeling a little vulnerable already ... " " That could be it , " he said . She laughed . " Bullshit . " Then abruptly she lowered her gaze . " So you still mean to talk with the Spragues . " He nodded , drawing in smoke , then letting it out with his words . " You want to come ? " Like sunlight breaking through dark clouds , Jessica smiled . " Not on your life ! " After a moment she asked , " When do you mean to do it ? " " Right away . " He leaned forward in his chair . " I 'm sure you 're right about why I have to do it  --  the feeling that something 's . . . out of control . I suppose if I were sensible , understanding that fact would be enough . " He looked at her soberly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I could n't , Pete , " she said . She caught a corner of her lip between her teeth , weighing the question in her mind . " I have appointments and meetings all day long , and anyway , if I went with you , how would I get back ? It 's an hour out to your . place , so if you drove n-e back it would he an hour in to town and an hour home again , for you , I mean . " She shook her head . " It would stake - to sense . "  | " I do n't know . " He shrugged . " You could spend the night at my place . I have a guest room  --  of sorts . I have to come in again tomor-row . " She met his eyes , then seemed embarrassed at having done so . " I do n't think so , " she said . " All right . " He stood up . " I 'll let you know how it turns out . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . As she opened it she looked back at him . " Be careful ? " " Certainly . " Like a Prussian officer , Mickelsson clicked his heels and bowed . " Oy , " she said , and rolled her eyes . After she was gone he put on his light overcoat , walked out to the parking lot , and drove to the parking-lot gate . As he was about to pull onto Campus Drive he saw her coming across the lawn , running with surprisinglylong strides , waving . She was tall and broad-shouldered , like a man , but ran with a woman 's special grace  --  ran , he thought , like a warrior-goddess out of Homer . He rolled down his window . When she reached him she laughed , out of breath , and called , " Hey , I changed my mind . Is that all right ? " " Hop in ! " he called back , and laughed with her . Jessica hurried around the front of the Jeep , still smiling as if delighted and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passenger-side door and unlocked it . She swung herself in . " Could we stop off at my office for just a minute ? " she asked . She was breathing hard . " I did n't have time to put a sign up to cancel my appoint-ments . " " No problem , " he said . He felt two things at once , emotions distinct and simultaneous as two colors on a flag : a flash of annoyance at the ageoldinconvenience of womanhood , and a flash of joy at her having left in such a hurry to catch up with him . Later , driving down Highway 8i , he asked , " By the way , why were you mad at me last night ? " " Was I ? " she asked . He gave her a look . She half smiled , then frowned , gazing through the windshield again , and after a moment lowered her eyes to the large , graceful hands in her lap . " You should have invited me to your party before the others , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at him , her shoulders hunched inward , her face a living history of the Diaspora  --  morose , legalistic , gentle . The thought of Donnie Matthews came into his mind , then the memory of all those nights he 'd sat up , pretending to work , checking the clock now and then against his will , wondering where the hell his %vile was and glad Ile did n't know . The sky darkened in ( teasingly as they wound up into the mountains . Here and there they paved , parked cars or pickup trucks , probably deer/hunters , he realized when he saw two men standing in a field with guns . On the backs of their Day-Glo orange jackets they had hunting tags . As he passed his house Mickelsson pointed , telling Jessica , " That 's it ! That 's where I live ! " She looked out , then rolled down her window to look back at it after they 'd passed . " It 's big ! " she said . " I had no idea it was so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . . . a house like that . . . " I have grandiose taste , " he said . " Who knows , maybe I 'll meet some little angel , have sixteen kids . " " You should . You 'd be a wonderful father , " she said . She shook her head . " I do n't know . A house like that , I 'd go honkers . " An awkwardness settled between them , or at least on Mickelsson . It was as if Donnie Matthews were right behind them , in the back seat . He drove her from his mind . Jessica was distant again , as if sorry she 'd mentionedchildren , or her fear of big houses . Mickelsson sighed and shook his head . He doubted that his daughter and son would agree about his gifts as a father , ignored and abandoned as they must feel . And angry , perhaps . Certainly it was anger in his son 's case ; otherwise he 'd have called . He glanced into the woods at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . Treetrunks , a tangle of bare branches , a few gray leaves . The light had a dead look . They passed a tarpapershack with the windows broken out , the driveway grown up in weeds . The climb was steep now . He shifted down . " It 's funny , " she said , " how much land there is in this country .. . that nobody lives on . " " It 's desolate , all right , " he said . He glanced at her . " It bothers you ? " She thought it over . " Of course . " She stole a glance at him . He slowed , passing John Pearson 's place . Though he 'd still had his dairy just a year ago , one would have thought the barns had stood abandonedmuch longer , the old gray silo tipping precariously away from the cowbarn , the doors hanging partly off the track like half-knocked-out teeth . The house was asbestos-shingled and dark , patched layer on layer , surrounded by rusting bits of machinery , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fenced , and in one corner four sheep with black faces stood watching the Jeep pass . Where they went for shelter he could not guess , unless the open , rusted cellar door gave the answer . It was a queer idea , obscurely depressing , the thought of sheep muffling around in an old man 's cellar . Behind the house , neatly stacked across the space of half an acre , stood cord on cord of wood . On the next mailbox he read , in black paint , 1 ) udak . Ile said , " Spragues ' should be the next place up . " She nodded . She sat turned partly sidevays , her 1 ighu ay in leachingp291as if casually toward the dashboard , the hand resting there with fingers spread wide . Whether she was afraid he would drive into a ditch or afraid of something else was not clear , but he would n't be surprised if it were the country itself that troubled her . Now the mountain was wooded on both sides of them , and there was snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road switchbacked sharply to the left , over a stone bridge spanning a deeply gouged creek , a fall that made the heart gasp , then climbed more steeply for a minute or two , then levelled off . He saw a mailbox in the distance , cocked back from the road like a pistol hammer , and as they drew nearer he made out an opening between trees , a two-rut lane that , except for the mailbox , he probably would n't have noticed . There were car tracks . He stopped the Jeep at the entrance to the lane and sat for a moment looking in . " Peter , " Jessica said , then did n't finish . He could see no house , at first ; then , as if by magic , out of the fallow gray of trees and brush the drab gray rectangle of the house emerged , the windows unlighted , no smoke coming out of the chimney . Not far from the house , leaning heavily to one side , sat a fat , gray car , perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest , the 196os . It was certainly not that car that had left the tracks . On the left side it had no tires . Nov he began to make out smaller buildings , all as gray as the house  --  something that might be a garage or chickencoop , something that might containpigs or a shaggy old pony . In high weeds at the side of the house there were butane tanks . Mickelsson leaned forward , looking up through the windshield , searching all around , and confirmed the suspicion that had come over him : no phone line , no electricity . " Are you sure there 's someone living here ? " Jessica asked . " I guess we 'll find out , " he said . He shifted into low and four-wheel drive , and the Jeep nosed slowly in . They saw when they came up beside it that the house was , like his own much grander house , a T-frame : behind the two-story front part , curtainless , paintless , plain as a box , a porched back part ran out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on blocks  --  trash lay underneath , and more trash in great , rotting mounds toward the rear  --  and the rear extension was crooked , bulged outward , the back wall fallen among corncobs like a square nose sniffing . " All out , " Mickelsson said , and opened his door . Jessica nodded , compressed her lips , and opened the door on her side . Dogs began to bark , noisy and frightening as a volley of shots , but when Mickelsson looked around for the source of the racket he saw at once that the dogs , leaping up at the chicken-wire wall of a lean-to shack , could not get at them . Something lay at their feet . He looked away . " It 's all right , " he said , meeting Jessica at the front of the Jeep and taking her elbow.  |p292She  nodded , watching the ground , stepping carefully , the dogs barking more and more wildly , snapping at the air , as the two of them moved toward the porch . Mickelsson kept his eye on the paintless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued to see those leaping , rollingeyed , half-starved hounds , and on the dirt floor by the dogs ' feet . . . whatever it was . . . a head of some kind , a horse or cow , perhaps ; he did n't much care to know which . " This is a crappy idea , " Jessica said softly as he brought up his fist to knock . He did not allow himself to think about it , but brought his knuckles down hard , three times , against the wood . The man who opened the door was shrivelled and bent forward like a monkey , maybe five feet tall , not a quarter-inch anywhere on his large , lead-gray face unwrinkled . He might be fifty , or he might be a hundred . He had a wrinkled , spit-stained cigarette in his hand , pinched between two arthritically swollen fingers , and smoke came out of his nose and mouth as if his meagre , dried-out insides contained smouldering rags . He wore a thick , filthy sweater full of holes and snags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age . His gray hair was stiff and went out in all directions , and though he 'd recently shaved , every crack on his chin and lower cheeks was full of bristles , feathery and silver as frost . He looked out through the screen with an expression of sharp curiosity , perhaps alarm , and even when Mickelsson said " Hello ! "  --  smiling , his voice as hearty as a farmer's -- the man said nothing . " My name 's Mickelsson . I live down the road a ways , down by Susquehanna , " Mickelsson said . Perhaps the man nodded ; it was hard to be sure . Then he turned to look up at Jessica with the same animal curiosity he 'd shown as he sized up Mickelsson . At last he smiled , showing naked gums and one last yellow tooth . " I know who ya are , " he said  --  a high , thin whine , merry grin like a boy 's . " Come on in ! " He pushed at the door and , when it stuck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung out he stepped back , making room for them to pass . Jessica stepped in as if completely at home , then stopped , two steps into the room , to wait for Mickelsson . The old man slammed the screen door , then the wooden door , and came in behind them . " I see you down there at the doc 's , " he said . " Yore place is right down under my place . " His head came forward , tongue lolling , as if he meant to make an obscene suggestion . " Sometimes I hear you , workin away in the middle of the night . " " I do that sometimes , " Mickelsson said . He spoke loudly , on the presumptionthat the old man was deaf . Jessica stood looking around , siniling vaguely , at the dark , filthy kitchen -- dishes in the sink , the dirt on them caked as if it had lain therep293for months ; grocery bags full of garbage along the walls ; patches of linoleumtorn away or worn through ; on the sagging ceiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kitchen stood a long pine table filled to the last inch with boxes of cereal , mason jars , an open milkcarton , dishes , silverware , balls of string , jumbled piles of sewing , bits of mail . Everything in the kitchen was the same color , the bone gray of longfallentimber . " Gwan along into the parlor , " the old man piped , waving in the direction of the doorway beyond them . " It ai n't as bad in there . If you need  --  " He broke off to cough , doubling over , covering his mouth with the hand that held the cigarette . Carefully , they picked their way toward the parlor . The room , when they reached it , proved as messy as the kitchen and cold as a barn , but at least it was lighter here , sunlight pouring in through the curtainless windows . The old man , still coughing , took a stack of magazines and old clothes from the sofa between the two windows , making just room enough for the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waffle-iron from the plywood-patched seat of a wooden chair opposite and sat down himself , facing them , four feet away . Again he showed his gums and his single up-stabbing tooth in a smile . " Make you a cup of Offaltine ? " he asked . " No thank you , " Mickelsson said . " I had coffee just before we left , " Jessica said . Her eyes moved from corner to corner of the room , half fear , half sharp disapproval . " Good , " the old man said , and laughed , poking his tongue out . " I doubt we could find it ennaway ! " Then he leaned back in his chair and just looked at them , smiling sociably , tongue lolling again , waiting . At the far end of the room a door opened  --  the old man did not turn to look , merely watched his guests in amusement  --  and an old woman with a haggardface and snow-white hair poked her head in , then drew it back again quickly and closed the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave a laugh . " She do n't like comp'ny . It ai n't that she do n't like ' em , really . She had a stroke , while back . She thinks she do n't look good . " " Poor thing ! " Jessica said . The fear and disapproval sank away as if by magic , replaced by a troubled look . " Wal , we all got our crosses , " the old man said . Then : " So you went and bought the doc 's place . " He drew the cigarette to his mouth and pulled at it , sucking the smoke in deep . " Yes , me and the bank , " Mickelsson said , mechanically smiling . He sat unnaturally erect , partly to give Jessica room , partly for fear that the sofa might give way if he put his full weight on it . " I understand you used to have relatives living there . " " ' That 's right , " the 1 ) 1 ( 1 titan said . Ile was quiet a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile studied Jessica , considering whether or not to say more , a11e1 at last said , " Great-uncle and - aunt of mine.  |p294Uncle  Caleb and Aunt Theodosia . Some people say they 're still down there . " He coughed . " As ghosts , you mean ? " Jessica asked , turning away from him , looking toward the door where the old woman hid . " That 's it , ma'am . " He laughed , then looked mock-stern . " They was never close with the rest of us . That 's why it got ' em . There 's Spragues all through these here mountains from one end to th'other , but they did n't want no part of that . They had no use for kin . " " It ? " Jessica asked , turning back to him , frowning a little , leaning forward . . The old man looked blank . " You said , That 's why it got ' em . ' " Sprague stretched his lips out , lifted his hand a few inches , then dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , " he said . " Sometimes people just get taken over , ya might say . By their moods or suthin . Some kinda feelin that 's in the woods . " He looked to Mickelsson as if for help . " You know , there 's us and there 's all that other . If people stick together , take care of their ownMickelsson nodded . " It 's not always easy , though . You , for instance , way out here in the wilderness ... " He just missed saying " sticks . " The old man nodded , smiling again , then came to . " Oh , we see people , " he said , abruptly defensive . " I got a brother Bill over there in Gibson , and a sister in Hallstead . They come by here now'n again , with the kids and all . We see people , all right . Not like we used to , now that Mother ai n't so well and the car do n't keep runnin . But Bill 's a mechanic , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gon na take that old automobile apart and get it runnin just like new . " Mickelsson nodded . He was sure the car had lain dead in the weeds for years . Jessica asked , looking at the old man 's hands , " How do you do your shopping ? " " Oh , I walk in , usually . Lot of time people will pick you up , you know . Everybody knows us . We been livin here sixty-seven years . Course soon 's the car 's fixed I 'll start drivin again . " " How far is it ? " Jessica asked . " Bowt five mile , " the old man said . He smiled , little fires in his eyes , as if something about her tickled him . Now the door at the end of the room opened again , and the old woman 's voice came out , fretful . Her words were slurred , not easy to understand ; her false teeth were noisy . " He walks all the way in and he walks all the way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick him up . " Jessica straightened up , trying to get a glimpse of the old woman . The old loan smiled . " She do n't know , " he said . I le leaned forwardp295and winked . " I fly , that 's the truth of it . I been granted the gift of flight . " " His heart 's bad , too , " the voice called . " All them cigarettes . " " Now , Mother , " the old man called , grinning at his lap . Jessica stole a look at Mickelsson . " One of these days he 'll be dead on the road there like a woodchuck , nobody find him for two , three weeks , and here I 'll be all by myself up here , ca n't even do for myself . " " Lord God protect us from crabby old women , " the old man said . He tipped his head up to smile at the ceiling . " But you do have company sometimes , do n't you ? " Jessica asked , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the road in front , as if somebody had been here not too long ago  --  yesterday , maybe , or last night . " The old man thought about it , grinding out his cigarette in an aluminum frozen-pie plate on the floor beside his boot , then shook his head . " Nope . " " You sure ? " Mickelsson asked . His voice was accidentally stern . " I noticed them myself . " The old man lifted his chin , his eyes narrowed , on guard . " Ai n't seen nobody in a week , " he said . " Mebby that car that sets and watches us . " " More like a month , " the old woman shouted from her place behind the door . Mickelsson frowned . " Maybe just somebody turning around in your driveway , " he said . " What kind of car is it ? " " Kids , mebby , " the old man said , and nodded . " I do n't go out and mess with ' em . " Now Jessica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she thought herself in danger . " Well , " she said , " it certainly was nice of you to invite us in . If there 's ever anything we can do for you  --  that is , anything Peter ... " " We get a lot of kids up here , " the old man said . He spoke quickly and peevishly , lest they not let him say it . He too got up , bending far forward , pushing down hard on the sides of the chairseat with his arms . " Give ' em half a chance , they 'll burn you out . " " Really ? " Mickelsson asked . Now he too was standing . " Yup . They got a gang . Burn people 's houses and barns down for money . Whole thing was in the Seskehenna paper . " " And you think - " Jessica began . IIe was leading them back through the kitchen now , making his way between garbage hags . " That 's right , " he said . " But tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well protected . " Ile turned , head bowed , to smile hack at them . " See this ? " he said . Ile teat hcd up to seize a rope near the kitchen door -a dark , frayed tope that went up into a hole ittp296the ceiling above . " Give this rope a good jerk , " he said  --  he suggested a pull without carrying it out , then pointed through the grimy kitchen window  --  " and out there in the dog-house the door on the side there pulls open , and out they tumble . " Jessica leaned down by the window , pressing her hands against her knees , to look . " Are they dangerous ? " she asked . Even bent over she was taller than old Sprague . " Wal , " the old man said , smiling , " there 's worse dogs and better dogs , but I 'll tell you this : they 're hungry . " Mickelsson said , " You really think there 's somebody that wants your house burned down ? " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheek twitched . He reached into his shirt pocket for his cigarettes , and his knobby fingers came out with just one , as if he had them in there loose . " There 's Dudak and Pearson  --  they 'd like to get my land if they could grab it off cheap . And there 's the doc . " He raised his eyes to meet Mickelsson 's , then smiled , pretending the look was not a challenge . " She 's a killer  --  that 's right . Believe me , I know ! And she knows I can prove it in a court of law . We been goin at it a long time now , her ' n ' me . " He hesitated , studying Mickelsson , still smiling . " She stole that house , ya know . Stole it right from under my shoes . " " My place ? " Mickelsson asked . " That 's it . " Jessica asked , " What happened ? " The old man held a match to his cigarette and sucked in , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " It 's a long story , but the long and short of it is , there was some taxes on the place and she paid ' em and took it , just like that . " " You could n't afford  --  " Jessica began . " She was quicker , that 's all , " the old man snapped . " Got there to the courthouse before I ever knowed what was doin . " Again a coughing fit came over him , ragged smoke-clouds spewing from his lungs with each cough . " Hmm , " Jessica said . She had her hand extended toward him , getting ready to say good-bye , but now she changed her mind . " Do n't matter . Comin to the end of it , " the old man said . " She 's got a hex on ' er . " " She 's got  --  " Mickelsson began , drawing back a little . " Never mind who put it , " the old man said , then laughed , eyes crazily merry . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized the doorknob , turned it , and opened the door for them . " Glad you folks come up , " he said , bobbing his head at Jessica , then at Mickelsson . " Now do n't be strangers ! " Across from the polth , tli htnty hounds ' ct  --  tt  --  leaping at the fencep297again , snapping and barking as if in rage and despair . Powdery dust clouded at their feet , obscuring the head on the floor . " Shet up ! " the old man yelled , and flapped his arms at them , to no avail . To Jessica he said , " Say hello to the ghosts for me , missus . " " I will , " she said , forcing a smile . She stood looking out at the dogs . " Do n't you folks fool with ' em , " the old woman 's voice called from somewhere nearby . " You leave them alone , the spirits 'll leave you alone ! " " We 'll be careful , " Mickelsson called . " So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somewhere where she could see him . " Take care , now , " the old man said , and reached as if toward a cap . " I 'll be seein ya . " He winked . " Someday yell look up in the sky and there I 'll be . " He flapped his arms like a bird . Jessica smiled . " All right , " she said . They crossed to the Jeep , neither of them glancing at the head thrown to the dogs . When the motor caught , Mickelsson waved one last time , then backed out . At the road he stopped , shifted into low , ready to start back down the mountain , but Jessica said , " Look , Pete ! Look at the snow in the woods ! It 's full of paw-prints ! " He saw that it was true . " He must 've freed them for a while , " he said . " Presumably sometime after last night 's snowfall . " " Or sicked them on someone , " Jessica said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly nodding . In his mind 's eye he saw the black dogs bounding along like deer beside the doctor 's car . He saw Pearson 's ram jerk his head up suddenly as the dogs came flying through the fenced-in yard , bellowing , and saw the ram take off , heading in blind terror for wherever the dogs were not . " Yes , " Mickelsson said , and nodded . " That must be what happened . " They sat side by side on the couch in his livingroom , staring into the crackling , sputtering fire in the open-doored stove , Jessica with her shoes off , one foot tucked up under her , the back of her head resting lightly on Mickelsson 's arm . Her face was solemn , like that of a child listening to the stories of a grandfather . When he moved his hand on her shoulder or arm , she did not stop him . His groin ached dully , and every now and then a light shiver passed over him . Her left arm lay along his right upper leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his crotch . No luck . Except for the fireplace and the nightlight in the kitchen , the whole house was dark . Outside , it was snowing a little . Jessica 's sherry glass sat untouched oil the glass collectable , Mickelsson ' abandoned martini beside it . I low she 'd gotten hint on the subject of the ghosts Mickelsson could n't remember . " So what was it like ? " she asked . " Ile just came into the bedroom andp298looked at you ? " Though her tone was impatient , she was serious , interested . " As I said , I 'm not really sure he was there at all . Anyway , he did n't look at me . " Mickelsson touched his forehead with two fingers . The scent of her hair and the nearness of her mouth impaired his capacity for thought . He said carefully , " He said something to someone  --  not to me , I think ; someone he expected would be there  --  and then he looked embarrassed , as if he realized he 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't even remember what he said ? " " Something like Are you there ? ' or , You in there ? ' " " So then what ? He turned around and saw you ? " He smiled at her bullying . " I do n't think he ever saw me , " he said . " I 'm not at all sure I saw him either , you know . The mind 's a queer business . People see things that are n't there all the time  --  crazy people , people on drugs , people who are asleep and do n't know it , people who 've been hypnotized . . . . When you think about it , it 's a wonder anyone 's certain of anything . " " Maybe so , but really , " Jessica protested , " you can tell at some level when what you 're looking at is n't really there . " " I could n't  --  not this time  --  though common sense makes me assume it was n't . I do n't know . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her benefit  --  the bearded old man shuffling in on him , staring with near-sighted , red-webbed eyes at the hatrack across the room . " I remember wondering at the time if maybe I was dreaming , " he said . He glanced at her . " Or crazy . " " What did you decide ? " " I could n't tell . I think what I pretty much decided was  --  " He closed his eyes for a moment , trying to make out whether or not he believed what he was about to say , not that it mattered , then finished : " It was n't craziness . Something real , possibly not a ghost . It could be , I think , that I was tuning in on something from the past . " " Spooky , " Jessica said , and sat forward in order to look into his face . " Spookier than a ghost ? " She shook her head . " It 's all pretty spooky , if you ask me . " She considered , then settled back against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger of her right hand she caught the wing of her collar , pullingit up almost to the tip of her chin , then letting it fall back . She glanced at him . " Do n't pick , " she said , and lightly slapped at his hand . Unconsciously he 'd been playing with her sleeve . Her eyebrows lowered and her expression became comically studious , eyes glittering and darkeningas the firelight and shadows moved . " You could be right , " she said at last . " I read a book , the autobiography of one of those psychics who work with the police . He talked about what he feels and sees as he works , and it 's a little like what you describe . It 's as if ' he 's itt two different rooms at once , two different times you know what I mean ? " She checkedp299his eyes , though why he should fail to understand her plain English was unclear to him . " He sees the people standing around him  --  the police , for instance  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're driving down the road and imagining something , you see the road , but you also see the thing you 're imagining . " Again Jessica leaned forward to see him better . " Did you feel anything funny ? In your body , I mean ? Did you feel old , for instance ? " Mickelsson shook his head . " Not that I remember . " " Maybe it 's different with different people , " she said . " Are you sure you do n't remember ? " He thought of Dr. Rifkin . " I 've tried . I ca n't . " As if disappointed in him but grudgingly forgiving , she lay her head back on his arm again . " I wish you 'd pay closer attention to things , " she said . Then she turned , rolled her eyes toward his , and smiled , as if afraid if she pushed too hard he might get balky and be of no use to her . " But it is interesting . " She rounded her eyes still more . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means ! " " It has to mean something ? " " God knows it does n't have to , " she said , " but maybe it does . Why is it these ghosts that people get glimpses of ? Is it possible they 're trying to warn us about something ? I know that sounds dumb  --  I do n't mean it , exactly . I think . But why is it this particular house that 's so alive ? Or maybe it 's you something about you , or people like you .... " " Tell you a different theory , " Mickelsson said . " It all started as a haunted-house story by a bunch of kids , and when I heard the story , being more or less suggestible , ' having a history of delusions of this kind  --  " She declined the gambit , clenching her fist on her knee . " But I do n't think it is nothing . ' There 's something about the house that feels . . . I mean , it 's a nice house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she frowned , then slid her eyes at him  --  " there 's this smell , Peter . " " Probably the spring in the basement , " he said . " It rots the wood . " " Are you crazy ? It smells like cake . " He shrugged , apologetic . The uncivil forthrightness no doubt had its advantages , but it was wearing . Jessica looked at him , then patted his arm as if conscious that she 'd slightly hurt his feelings . " You have noticed it , have n't you ? " she asked . He 'd had , he knew now  --  one after another  --  strange sensations he 'd dismissed at the time : fantasies of indistinct voices , smells , an occasional sense of people near him , observing , nodding . . .. Suppose it were not just flickering dream-work but something more active . Suppose they had , whatever it might Horan , some kind of stake it- him . He felt her hair brushing lightly against his wrist , tickling it , and when he hi rallied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile was stirred , as one always is , he thought ; but at the same time he wasp300hurled deeper into the pit of himself . He imagined himself making love to her , huffing and blowing away in the bed upstairs , both of them mmming and groaning with delight , Jessica generously faking by the ancient Rules of Order for sexual politicians . He remembered for no reason what old man Sprague had said : Sometimes people get taken over . . Some kinda feelin that 's in the woods . That was what was happening to him , the reason he was beginning to see ghosts . He shuddered severely enough that Jessica noticed . She turned to him and , like someone reaching out to touch a nervous stallion , put her hand on his chest . " Are you cold or what ? " she asked . Down in the valley the train was rumbling through the darkness with its freight of lost childhood . Abruptly , to free himself from the sweetness of her touch , he leaned forward , reaching for his pipe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the bowl . " Do n't pull away , Pete , " she said , as if she were now the injured one . She leaned forward too , moving her left arm around behind him and pressing her right hand flat on his chest , over his heart , where the pain was . She drew back a little , away from the pipe-smoke , and blew at it . Against his will , he savored the calm spreading out from her hand . So it had once been with Ellen . Age-old story . He said , " I was thinking about what old Sprague said , the feeling that 's in the woods . I know what he means . " He scowled , bold sign of sincerity , though he had no intention of saying what was in his mind . No more cowpastures apparelled in celestial light . That was why he hated it when her judgments of people were clinical , unwilling to consider anything not physically there : because she was right . " Why are you massaging my chest ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Except that maybe someday your chest may ache . Good long-range investment . " His chest ached more , and the magical healing power of her hand  --  so it seemed  --  became all the more annoying . Christ , what would n't he give for Jessica to be in love with him ! But he 'd learned what Jessica , of the tribe of Freud , had no doubt always secretly known . No love , just fuck . He decided to put the pipe down ; he could survive for at least a few minutes without it . What difference ? He said , " It 's not like entropy  --  not like simple loss of energy , simple giving up . It feels more like something alive , like those dogs , or rattlesnakes . " He looked at her forehead . The side of her breast was touching the side of his . They were inching up on the time of decision . Someone must make the first move . Was the game already started ? " I 'm dull company , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheap move , but piss on it . She put her finger to his lips , leaning close . Her eyes were distant and thoughtful . She placed her mouth where he had no real choice but to kiss it.  |p301Mickelsson  lay beside her , trying to think , trying to come alive . Noi that his body was asleep , non-functional . His body was a massive con tradiction , his erection immense and violent , the rest of him  --  his finger tips and lips , even his large , cold feet  --  so timid , so constrainedly gentle as if robbed of life-force by the ache in his heart , they were almost non material . The smoothness of her skin , the fullness of her breasts  --  pale underneath , glorious with tan and color toward the shoulders  --  her perfect nipples , the dark , soft bush between her legs , all took his breath away beauty beyond his wildest dreams . Yet his heart was drowning in wretch edness . " Pete , it 's all right , " she crooned , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her breasts touching his arm and chest . His seas ( of doom hovered over him like a foreign presence , worn out , icy wit ' indifference . Yet here was this body of his in a state of jubilee ! He hardl dared to touch her breasts , though he touched them , first with his fingers then with his lips and tongue , hungrily . Women hate to be touched Women are lunar . She kissed the top of his head , then his eyes , nose cheeks  --  sweetly , tentatively , as though she knew the slightest error wool ( make him draw away again , feeling foolish and fat . Oh , she was good -- A-plus , five stars  --  no question ! Or could it be that she was still unsure afraid of him , holding back out of timidity ? He moved his hand iron the softness of her belly to her crotch and to his astonishment found i wet , more than ready for him . Rarely in his life  --  either in his marries life or in his occasional affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming evidence that he was desired . His mind , wit ! all its doubts and considerations , switched off for a moment , his peni : stealing his brain 's blood  --  ah , Nature ! ah , Devil !  --  and his heart , like an animal beaten and shouted to activity , began to labor , sending rever berations through his body . He eased himself up over her and toucher the lips of her vagina with the tip of his painfully throbbing cock . Hi heart hammered crazily now ; he realized again that he could die . Sin raised her head from the pillow and , as if doing some magic charm , kisses him four times , quickly . Then he eased himself into her . They hot ! gasped and almost laughed , and her arms came around him , clinging as he clung to her . Her legs locked around him like jaws . Soon a motiol he could not control came over him  --  over her as well  --  a terribly mechanical power he 'd never in all his years been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel shaman-like , as if the curtain o illusion had parted and they 'd fallen to the beginning of things . ller face shone , her smile wide . Whet ) at last the explosion cane , lie felt light , a if turned from heavy flesh into thin , shining all . Now he did at las laugh , and ' noised his cheek against hers . " Wow ! " she said into his ear . " Wow ! "  |p302He  slept , heavy as a bear in winter , more serene than he 'd felt in a long time . Then  --  perhaps hours had passed , perhaps only minutes  --  he found himself desperately laboring up from slumber , gasping , full of fear , trying to make out what he must do . Then he was in the room , and understood that the shouting came from Jessica in her sleep . She was crying out with stinging , crackling anger , such blood-curdling rage that he was afraid to touch her and awaken her . Though the room was silent now , he realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! Just fucking stay back ! Let me be ! " It was like the voice of someone else . From all he knew of her , he could not have guessed her capable of such tones . She was still tense , he saw , and grinding her teeth like one of Luther 's devils . He rose up on his left elbow to touch her upper arm , then gently , cautiously kissed the side of her face . She was sweating as if with fever . " Jessie , " he said softly . She murmured something , still angry , but she relaxed a little . Half an hour later it happened again . " Jessie , Jessie , Jessie , " he whispered , moving his hand on her head as though she were a sleeping child . He listened to the name in the darkness , the sound nosing out into the room as if in bafflement , trying to make sense of itself . Jessie ? Jessie ? One thought of , if not Shakespeare , fat wives of rabbis , or bitchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to do with this soft-faced midnight changeling ? " Poor Jessie , " he whispered . Whether or not she 'd been faking her pleasure , or yelling out at him that pure , ancient hatred , she was another poor miserable damned mortal . Jesus , he thought , what a stupid fucking existence . He blinked away tears . A moment later , he realized that his hand was no longer moving on her head ; he 'd drifted off . All are faithless , saith the angel . He stroked Jessie 's head from front to back twice more , then gave in to gravity.  |p303He  had been working at his desk for some time when he heard the upstairs toilet flush and knew Jessica was up . According to his watch it was ninethirty . That was late , for her . He wondered if it meant that she 'd slept peacefully at last . The thought stirred anxiety , and he looked back at the papers spread before him . A few minutes later a knock came at his door , and he called , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there in his white terrycloth bathrobe , tentatively smiling , one hand on the doorframe . She had on no make-up but had brushed her hair . A confusion of emotions rushed over him . Except for Donnie , he had n't seen a woman in her morning 's natural beauty for a long time : clear-eyed , human , nothing about her doll-like or prepared . It was so much like being married that he could n't make out whether the sight filled him with happiness or misery . ( His cock had no such problem . It stirred like an old dog waking up , looking around . ) " Hi , " she said . He nodded . " You must have slept well . " " I did . " She came to him , put her hand on his shoulder , then moved her palm , massaging the muscle . After a moment she bent down cautiously and kissed him . When she 'd straightened up again she gazed into his eyes  --  only for an instant , but purposefully , as if to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nichts ist wahr , alles ist erlaubt . Now she was looking at the papers in front of him , covertly reading , ready to look away and play innocent if she must . Her eyes raced . " What are you working on ? " He put his left arm around her , then moved his hand to her left thigh . " I 've been more or less unworking , " he said . His right hand waved off grandiloquence . " For a while now I 've been fiddling at what I like to think of as a sort of blockbuster philosophy book , something to make the best-seller list and earn me a fortune . " She was amused , cautiously interested , sliding her eyes at him then hurriedly back to the paper , still reading . " I 'd start out , " he said , with superchranaatic stuff : the graphic presentationof an imaginary case of child-molesting and murder committed by a quadraplegic nine-year-old , then a rape with ice tongs , intended to cover up a devilish cloak-and-dagger conspiracy by government agents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raison d'etre . .. " He out hisp304right hand over the page she was reading , his fingers spread wide . She smiled and mugged Not Guilty ! " But this morning it came to me that the only really good parts so far are the roaringly dull ones . Consequently , ' ' To the contrary ' . . . So I 've been sitting here crossing things out . " " Who needs wealth , right ? " With the back of her hand she snowplowed mountains of rubies to oblivion . " As long as you 've got your happiness , and paid-up health insurance ... " He laughed . His erection was becoming a problem . She slipped from his one-armed embrace and went over to the window . Her arms were folded , drawn in against her chest . " It 's beautiful out , " she said . A soft snow was falling , mounding up over the birdbath , settling on the dark branches of the pines . The morning sunlight was bright again , deceptively warm-looking ; the cloud cover had rolled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I can do that . " He made as if to push back his chair . " No , really , I 'd like to . You work a little longer  --  that 's what you 'd be doing if I were n't here , right ? " " I 'd probably still be up in bed , hung over and groaning . " She laughed . " Eggs ? Scrambled ? " " Sure . Terrific . There 's bacon , I think . Peppers and onions in the bottom drawer of the fridge . " " I 'm sure I can find things . You drink coffee in the morning ? " " I finished off half a pot already . " He pointed at the cup . " I 'll make some more . " She reached across him , took the cup , and went out , closing the door behind her . That pleased him , her closing the door . Ellen would never have done that . He 'd have had to get up , after she was gone , to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did so , petty , unsociable , spinsterish . For a minute or more he sat staring at his page , his eyes going over and over the words , in his mind the image of Jessica at the window , her buttocks and legs strong under the tightly cinched , overlarge bathrobe , her jaw  --  when she turned her face to him  --  clean-lined , cheekbones high . With one hand he moved his erection over into the looseness of one pantleg , his fingers lingering a moment as he thought about going out and propositioning Jessica . Then , though the image of her was still in his mind , he began to get the sense of the words on the page and began to be interested . The old dog yawned and settled down to rest . Mickelsson picked up his pencil and slashed out a paragraph , then began writing in his small , meticulous script , more and more rapidly , in the margin . Over , he wrote , running out of space , and flipped the paper to continue on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sizzling of bacon or smell the rich effluence coming from the stove until she tapped on his door again and opened it . " Ready ? " I longer leaped in hint , and he pushed hack his chair.  |p305They  ate in the as yet unremodelled kitchen , large , gray , astir with chilly draughts . The chill seemed to him more pleasant than unpleasant ; but then , he was fully dressed , wearing a sweater , whereas Jessica wore nothing but his terrycloth bathrobe . While she ate with her right hand , forking in her food like a teen-ager in a hurry , she held the collar closed around her neck with the left . " Jessie , let me get you a sweater , " he said , and rose from the table . " I 'm all right , " she said , looking up as if he 'd broken her train of thought . " Do n't let your eggs get cold . Anyway , I ca n't put a sweater over this . " " My sweaters are big , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was n't mistaken , he 'd left his old black sweater with holes in the elbows . He found it where he 'd thought he would , and returned to the kitchen . " Hands up , " he said , as he 'd said long ago to his children . " Hang on to the cuffs . " She turned to look up at him , unpersuaded and inconvenienced , then obeyed . " Jesus , the fuss you make about things , " she said , then laughed , her last sounds muffled by the lowering sweater . He allowed his fingertips to graze her breasts as they passed , and when her face popped out , he kissed her , then stood back to look . " It 's definitely you ! " he said , wagging both hands , limp-wristed . " Who else ? " she grouched , then looked down at herself . It might indeed have been someone else , a hobo who 'd recently lost weight . She did not smile . " So anyway , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hurried to his chair and sat down . He liked her in the ratty , baggy sweater . He smiled , watching as she laboriously rolled up the cuffs . " You 'll admit , it 's nice to be warm , " he said . She said , wrinkling her nose , " It smells of turpentine . " He knew that instant that nothing of Buzzy 's had ever smelled of anything if he could help it . When he 'd cleared away the dishes , piling them in the sink , and they were seated , each working on a third cup of coffee  --  the sun risen higher now , pouring into the kitchen from the entry-hall , making one bright place on the wall and floor , throwing the rest of the room into greater darkness  --  Jessie asked , breaking what had grown to an extended silence , " What did you make of Mr. Sprague 's talk about flying ? " " Do you mean do I think he believed it ? " Shc shrugged , then waited . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw me , but I guess I 'm ( arching on . " Ile 01 ( 1 ( 11 after it moment , " It 's not like anyplace else I know ol . I suppose if I were a sot iologist ' ' When she glanced up at him , he moved his head as if nudging away objections . All I mean is , everyplace has its own oddities , things that make peoplefeel part of the group . " **26;9631;TOOLONG , a man was walking a white poodle whose fur was cut to resemble a lion 's . I walked down a shadowed alley behind Mineo 's apartment . The sun was setting , and it was that time of day when things look almost too clear , like they 're outlined in black . I peered into empty garage spaces and at some parked cars . There were gasoline stains on the cement . To my left was an empty courtyard between two low apartmentcomplexes . I saw a fruit tree , red canvas chairs , and a striped beach umbrella over a metal table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near the other end of the alley , I saw someone standing insidea garage smoking . " Hello , " I shouted , and waved . I looked behind me . It was twenty yards back to the street where I 'd parked the Dodge . It was getting dark . The figure took a few steps . I recognized Mark 's long-legged gait . " I wanted to make sure you did n't bring the cops , " he said , stopping a few feet away . " Thanks for trusting me , " I said . He shrugged and looked down at the dark cement , inhaling on his cigarette . I peered over his shoulder into the dark garage , wondering where Sal Mineo 'd been killed . " You 're standing on it , " he said , reading my mind . " What ? " " His car space . The place where it happened . " He shook his head hard like a dog shaking water from his ears , hunched his shoulders , and said , " Let 's go , Nancy Drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I felt overdressed in a long coat . I found myself admiring the lines of Mark 's back , as he loped ahead to the courtyard . I followed him over the small path , bending to avoid huge rubber-tree leaves . Behind me a leaf hit the ground with a small crash . A roar of motors told me I was walking toward Holloway Drive . He swerved left , crossing a lawn , and approached a lowapartment . Each apartment had an outdoor entrance with two white columns . I stepped over a redwood barrel filled with gigantic geraniums . Mark stopped near the round iron table and the torn beachp101umbrella . Sal Mineo might 've tossed the Coca-Cola bottle into the hedge . The deserted courtyard was a poor man 's paradise in Southern California . I stepped on something soft and alive . He watched me pull a small fruit off my shoe . " Green peaches , " he said . " I was waiting for them to get ripe so I could make him peach cobbler . " I smelled the sweet peach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fruit falls off before it ripens , " he said . Mark walked down a path , up four concrete steps , and rapped his knuckles on a door between two white columns . " Who is it ? " a woman asked . " Mark Loren . " She opened the door a few inches . I saw part of her face , small and overpowered by black eyeliner . " You real busy ? " he asked . As I followed him over her doorstep , I stumbled into a clay pot tilled with booming cactus . I smiled at the woman . " I 'm Annie Harmon , " she said . The eyewitness who 'd called the sheriff 's office . I liked the way she looked . She was wearing a green leotard and green tights and she was breathing hard . She wore a short sharp haircut , and she was about forty-five and small-boned . " What 's your sign ? " she asked me . I was tempted to say asparagusor Valium , but I did n't . Her small living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil paint . Big paintingsof wildflowers were hanging on walls , leaning against chairs , and sitting in windows . I listened patiently while she told me that a Cancer woman like me is emotional and hides her feelings from herself . I stared at a picture of glorious bluebells . Astrology always reminds me of clinical psychology books in college . Every symptom you read about sounds as if it belongs to you . " You 'll fall in love out here , " she told me , lowering herself into the lotus position in the middle of the living room . " Right , " Mark said , and he suddenly sang a blues line in a tight falsetto : " Love , what are you doing to my friends .... " Hep102stopped abruptly and a second later disappeared out the back door of the apartment . It sounded as if this visit was too hard for him . I finally asked Annie Harmon about Sal Mineo . " He was so special , " she said , and stopped , biting her lower lip . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nobody else . You know what I mean ? " " I 'd like to understand . " She hesitated . " I go to work now , the Old World . I 'm filling in ; mostly I work days . Come over later . I 'll take good care of you . I 'm senior waitress . " " Did he go there ? " I asked . She looked surprised . " Yeah . I talked the boss into inviting Sal , four squares a week on the house . It made us look good . " " You liked him ? " " I loved him . I been here longer than even Sal . My dad , he was a stunt rider . Before he died he rode in posses for Gene Autry . I was dialogue coach on ' I Love Lucy ' for ten years . But I got eased out , and Sal gave me money . " " How close were you ? " I asked . " Honey , there 's a lot more to relationships than fucking every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her leg high , grasping her ankle with one hand . Mark wandered back inside the apartment . He patted her foot . " Annie , baby , you still got the key ? " " No , I do n't , " she said without moving . " Yes , you do , " he said quickly . " I have the right to go in there . " He looked over at me . " She shares Sal 's back hallway . He left a key with her for safety 's sake . " Mark squatted down and kissed the top of her forehead . " Give it to me . " " What good is it ? " She lowered her leg and leapt lightly to her feet . But she did n't produce a key . " Did n't you do his horoscope ? " I asked her . She said , " I saw trouble with his upper torso . It 's a bitch , is n't it ? " " Did you tell him ? " " Sort of , " she said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw the kid running away , the pig . "  | " What 'd he look like ? " I asked . " It was too dark . I saw the side of his head . I think he was blond . " " You did n't recognize him at all ? " " It was dark . I was just walking out back . " She jabbed a thumb over her shoulder . " I thought Sal was home  --  his living room was lit up , and it was past dinnertime . I was carrying my garbage down to the bins . I probably walked right by the bastard hiding in the garage unless he was driving with Sal in his car . " Then she grabbed Mark 's wrist , and her voice shook . " Oh , Jesus God , it 's shit , is n't it ? " Mark kicked at a tube of oil paint on the floor . " Do n't talk about it anymore . " " Wait , " I said . " Let me ask her one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to say " the murderer " in front of Mark . " You gon na give me that key ? " he interrupted . She untied a narrow black ribbon with a key hanging on it from around her neck and handed it to Mark . " When I got back to my door , I heard Sal pull up . " She folded her hands in front of her flat stomach . " I heard somebody screaming , saying something like No , no , help me , please , God , help me . ' " She recited the words without particular emphasis . " I did n't hear anything else , just something falling against a car and the screaming . I went running back to the garage . I did n't recognize Sal 's voice . I just figured somebody was in trouble . " " What did you see ? " " Stop it , " Mark said . " Stop talking about it . " " Go try the key , " Annie said . He walked out . She glanced at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Sal lying there making terrible sucking noises like he was drowning . And I saw somebody running down toward the street . " From the hallway Mark shouted , " Hey , Sara . " " Do you think the police can find the man ? " I asked . Every once in a while , you find somebody you can pester with questions  --  check your hunches out  --  and you hate to give them up . " You never know . There 's justice somewhere . " " What 's Jonathan like ? " I asked . " Oh , he 's a wild kid . He 'll settle down . " " How does he make a living ? "  | " He 's a studio musician . Banjo . " " How did he get along with Mineo ? " " With Sal ? Well , it was stormy . " " Was he jealous of Chris ? " " Is the Pope Catholic ? " She added , " No offense , miss , if you 're Catholic or anything . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small kitchen . It was white , spotless , with no sign of food . But she probably ate meals at the Old World . In the back hallway , Mark was standing next to an open door to another apartment . " I 'm going in , " he said . " Not me , " I said . It felt indecent . Mark disappeared and began clumping around inside the dark apartment . He knocked something heavy to the floor . From the doorway Sal Mineo 's living room smelled like old air and dust . " Do n't do nothing till I find the light , " he said . Suddenly I felt something strangely like nostalgia . Sal Mineo had come home to this room for years . I 'd never seen him in it and I never would . He found the light switch . From the hall I said , " Mark , I do n't feel right . " " I invited you here , " he said . " But you 're on your own . " I stepped inside the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't touch anything , " he said . " You could be ruining fingerprintsor making new ones . " The living room was small , and the brown squared sofa looked comfortable . There was one expensive piece against the white walls , a leather and rosewood Eames chair . The place looked as if somebody were moving out . Cartons of books and kitchen utensilssat in the middle of the room . On the coffee table were a few pennies , a paperback copy of Lolita , and a brass incense burner with ashes in it . The only thing in the room that clearly marked Sal Mineo was a magazine called Film Comment , addressed to him . For a moment I wanted to take it with me as a souvenir . But I did n't have the nerve . I peeked into the bathroom . On the sink was a silver tooth/brush with smashed bristles , an old tube of fennel toothpaste , and a bone china shaving mug . A week before these things had been part of this man 's morning ritual . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark was sitting on a carton and looking around the living room . " Whenever I 'd knock on the door , music was playing real loud . He loved early Beethoven and Wagner . Then the door 'd open up and it 'd be him and music and I always felt good . " I tripped on something . It was a yellow plastic bowl with " Dov " stamped on it . " For the collie , " Mark said . " Jonathan 's caring for him now . Sal named the dog after his character in Exodus . He liked to call him Starfucker , ' because when he was a pup he was running away all the time to Jack Benny 's house . People are dumb . Some reporter once asked Sal if he did it with his dog . Sal said , Sure , and he even wears a leather collar . ' " Mark stood up and closed his eyes . I still could not believe that I was here . It had happened too fast . Lying on the floor was a theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin dressed up as a matron in a platinum wig and a sable coat . I turned to Mark . " What 's The Carnival ? " " A play Sal produced . For old Chris , " he said . " What was it about ? " He flopped down on the carton and shook his head slowly from side to side . He was staring at the floor between his knees . " It 's about a guy who picks up a boy , takes him home , and the boy stabs him . " He laughed . " It ai n't like life , right ? " Mark looked as if he were listening to something far away . I ran one hand across the scratches in the coffee table . " Do n't touch things , " he said , shooting me one of his fast glances . I had forgotten fingerprints . Now three long smudges from my fingers ran down the dust of the coffee table . But I kept on looking . I knelt down and pulled paperback books out of a carton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Boys , and The Cocksure Rock Star . " His paperback porn collection . " Standing above me , Mark kicked at the carton . " Damn things . " " Did he like them ? "  | " Well , he was writing a movie script out of one of them . Take one . Nobody wants them . " He snorted and handed me The Cocksure Rock Star . Inside the book was an L.A. Times clipping , three months old . The article announced Sal Mineo 's plans to star in P.S. Your Cat Is Dead . I read one paragraph : " Mineo says that he has no qualms about playing a bisexual . This guy is lonely . He 's looking for love . It 's like if you needed food , it does n't matter whether it 's breakfast , lunch , or dinner . ' " I shoved it into my shoulder bag . Someday the book would prove to me that I had seen this small apartment . I pulled a screenplay out of the carton and read : Fortune and Men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Miss Chasin at Canyon Loan Company . No date . I put the card back inside and opened to the title page . It was covered with handwritten notes . " Sal wrote in books when he got excited , " Mark said . He picked up a huge mask of an ape . " Planet of the Apes . Sal got great reviews as a monkey . " " I never understood why he took that part . " " Well , he wanted to act in films again , and he got star billing . It proved his name had marquee value . " " Did he mind that nobody saw his face ? " " He laughed about it . " I figured Sal Mineo minded . Mark held the mask over his face . I did n't like it . He took it off , saying , " Roddy McDowall gave him this at the wrap party . " Just then the telephone rang . After the second ring I ran to answer it , but I put my hand on the receiver and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what he would do . His head jumped with each ring . It stopped , and then started again . It rang eight times . " Do something , " I said . I wanted to scream . Suddenly , the bedroom door opened . I knocked the receiver off the telephone and threw myself across the room at Mark . His hands were cold . I think I screamed . The screenplay fell out of my hand , and Mark picked it up . " Stay there , " a man shouted at us , and grabbed the telephone . It did n't make me feel better when I recognized him . He spoke into the telephone . " Casey here , it was them .... Oh right , you did ? ... They came inside . Good work . "  |p107Casey  slammed down the telephone , sat down on the couch and spread his knees . His pale blue eyes were tired . He yawned , and I saw he was eating a piece of white candy . " This is the last warning . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend to stay out of it , or I 'll book you as a material witness . We 'll see your standard of living go down in the slammer . " Mark lit a cigarette . It was a silent show of bravado . Casey stood , grabbed the cigarette from Mark 's lips , and stamped it out on the brown wool rug . It smelled like burning hair . " Now get the hell out , " he said . Nobody said goodbye . Outside , Annie Harmon was standing in her doorway between the two white columns . Mark loped past her and disappeared down the path toward the garages . I thanked her and walked out back to find him . It was dark in the alley . All the empty concrete made me shiver . It was quiet as a graveyard . " Over here , " he said . He was sitting in his car , the top down and the lights off . " I got to get on home , " he said . " Why 'd you come here ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started his motor . His white Cadillaclooked at least fifteen years old , and had chrome tail fins , a dented silver fender , and a weird black door . " Can I see that screenplay ? " I asked . He handed it back to me . " I 'll take good care of it . " He was staring at me appraisingly . This time I looked away . " I 'll cook up some dinner for you tomorrow night , " he said . " Okay . " He twisted his neck and backed the wide Cadillac down the skinny alley . I opened the screenplay . I realized I was looking at ripped edges . The title page with the handwriting had been torn out . I held the spine of the thing , flipped through the pages , and shook it hard . The loan agency card was missing too.  |p108I  drove to Cleon Wilson 's neighborhood at noon the next day . There was a harsh white quality to the sun . It made me clench my teeth . I cruised down a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared down empty alleys between bungalows , then got out of my car to find a house number . It was hot and still , and I smelled smog . A dog nosed over a trash can and licked orange rinds . I smelled frying bacon . Disco music pounded from an open kitchen window . I heard a man humming along . The strangled backyard was dust brown . I could n't find any house number . I wanted to get out as soon as I could . White girls do n't go chasing assignments in Watts unless they 're ambitious to a fault . I could n't remember any smart reasons for being here . A police siren wailed . Then I saw three teenage boys hanging out near my car . One guy 's arm was inside my front window . He smiled at me , pulled it out , and waited . I cringed when the black and white police car blared past . The boys backed away , leering at me , " Hey , lady , better take care of your stuff . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white sneakers running behind me . I ignored him and tried to park between two empty trucks . Four tries and I gave up . The kid was still chasing me when I passed a bus stop with a bench painted with an advertisement for " El Dinero. "  |p109I  checked him out again in my rearview mirror . At least it was daytime . He was grinning , and he terrified me . I did n't know how to read danger signals in this neighborhood . In Harlem , 125th Street is crammed with people . I slowed down to peer at more ramshackle houses with television antennae . It was hard to believe this was an urban black ghetto . Except for a bombed-out no-man's-land feeling . A fat woman stopped pulling stiff dungarees off a clothesline and shook her head at me . Behind her a gnarled cactus , and a patch of scarlet bougainvillea was climbing the brick walls of a liquor store . Two guys stood in a parking lot piled with beer cans . I saw too many pawn shops and second-hand clothing stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright sky and no white people . I rode down a side street past a shack with a broken front windowand a white picket fence . Next door , the Wilson house was unpainted brown stucco and had a screen door and a chicken wire fence . I parked the car against a low curb littered with newspapers . The black boy leaned a bare elbow on the Dodge door . " Watch out , " I said . He banged the door with his fist . " For one buck , let 's say I guarantee the car . " " Beat it , " I said . He looked about nine . " Lady , do n't get weird . I got lotsa time , " and he laughed . " Pick on somebody your own size and intelligence , " I said . " Hey , lady . " He looked over his shoulder . Unfortunately forme , the coast was clear . " Do n't lose your cool . " " I was implying that both your size and your intelligence are inferior to my own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It rattled me . " You some kind of crazy teacher ? " he asked . In fact , I was imitating my mother . I was also imitating HumphreyBogart , who could take a gun out of a bad guy 's hand by just convincing him he could do it . I decided to negotiate . " I 'm no teacher , but I 'll give you the dollar when I leave . " " Shit , you better , " and he kicked at my tire in a proprietary manner . We had a deal . I walked up the cracked cement path and rang the doorbell . Itp110made a harsh cawing sound . I was standing on a wooden step that had n't been painted or washed in years . I jumped when a man yelled , " Who 's there ? " " You get it , " a woman shouted . The screen was hanging off the wood door frame . " I 'm Sara Martin , " I said into the crack . " I 'm looking for Cleon Wilson . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm from a New York newspaper . " A guy opened the door and I took an involuntary step backward . His face looked Negro , although his skin was a pale ashyellowcolor and he also had freckles . His brown eyes were puffy from sleep , lack of sleep , or drugs . His hair was weird . He had peroxided some of it to a brassy orange color and braided small tufts all over his head . " You from New York ? " He sounded puzzled . " Cleon Wilson ? " I asked . " I ai n't , and he ai n't here . " He shifted his weight . Under his workshirt he had the huge arms and shoulders of a weightlifter . He was n't tall ; his legs were short and bowed under the dungarees . He looked about nineteen . " Well , where is he ? " I stepped back toward him . " Gone , " he said . " Where ? " " To talk to the devil about some deal . What do you want from brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " I 'll tell you if you tell me where I can find him , " I said . " Ai n't nobody knows where the dude is now , but I can get him , " he said . " I can get to anybody . " " Does he live here ? " " Oh , sometimes . What do you want from him , again ? " " Well , I 'm a newspaper reporter and he told the police he knew something about a story that I 'm working on . " He stared at my legs . " You married ? " " No . " I stepped up further onto the doorsill to block his view . " Does he have another address ? " " Look , he 's some blood dude that crashes here when I say okay . " " What 's your name ? "  | " Johnson , Jerry Lee Johnson , " he said . " Come on in . " He did n't move . I did n't want to act scared so I squeezed past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic and sweat . His palms and fingers were fat . His wrists were wide . " You live in the valley ? " he asked . I did n't know what he meant . " Yeah , you know , Van Nuys , " he said . " No . I told you I 'm from New York . " Although his mouth did n't change at all , I felt the tension in his eyes . His lids widened . He seemed amazed and suddenly alert . He bolted the front door behind us . I was locked in with him . " What 's your name again ? " I asked , sitting down on a green couch in the living room . I was pretending to be a routine guest . There were some color pictures of Jesus Christ and Bruce Lee on the walls . A punching bag was nailed in a doorway . " Jerry , " he said . " Jerry what ? " " Jerry Johnson , that 's what my friends call me . " " This your house ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my parents got the papers on it , but I live here , " he said . We were both jumpy . I wondered why I was making him nervous . He said , " You going up against brother Cleon ? You ai n't scared of the devil ? " " No . " My voice was loud . " Well , he 's one tough son of a bitch , but he no tougher than me , Jerry Johnson . " " What does that mean ? " " Well , I think he could off a dude like that . " He snapped a wide thumb and forefinger in the air . " You talking about murder ? " I asked , and concentrated on looking him in the eye . He started to whoop with laughter . " That 's what I 'm talking , baby . " He sprawled back , laughing , a series of gasps that were part explosion and part shriek . The guy gave me chills . He sounded like a catfight . " You work or anything ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern women . It was probably the least offensive way to ask it of this man . " Oh , off and on . " " Doing what ? " I asked . " Well , I make things happen . " I gave up on him . " Look , will you give a message to Cleon Wilson ? " " I 'll put the word out on the street . " " Thanks , " I said . I told him that Wilson could call me at the Chateau Marmont . " You gon na make him famous as Lucifer or something ? " Jerry Johnson asked . He had been concentrating before he asked the question . I could see it meant a lot to him . He still had not figuredout what I was doing in his house . " Maybe so , " I said . " Why ? " " Well , he may know something about who killed Sal Mineo . " He stood up and stretched his body . He cracked his knuckles . " He told me some stuff . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I guess he and my old lady stopped off at a shooting gallery and some dude was bragging about killing a famous guy in Hollywood . " " What did the other guy look like ? " " Blond dude . " I tensed up . " The famous guy was Sal Mineo ? " " Yeah , " he said . " The dude claimed it was a contract hit . Some heavy cocaine dealer bought it . They paid the guy heavy bread . " " How much ? " " Oh , about twenty-five hundred bucks . " He stretched his arms high above his head , pleased with my undivided attention . " Did Wilson know the guy who did it ? " " No , man , he do n't know , " he said . " But then he do n't say everything he knows . " Jerry Lee Johnson was a con artist , and my instinct was not to believe him . But I could n't ignore him . " You go to discos ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded angry . I looked over at the locked front door . He seemed to take my answer as a personal rejection . " That Mineo dude was some bigtime cat , " he said . " Right . " " The cops are pretty dumb . " " What makes you say that ? " " I hear they did n't give a shit about brother Cleon . " " I 'm interested in him . " " I 'll find him for you . " I heard another door slam . A girl walked into the living room . She had the same ash skin color as Jerry Johnson . They could have been siblings . I stood to show my respect , but she did n't look at me . " Get out , " Lee said to her . She put her fists on her hips . " I 'm Sara Martin , " I said . " Well , you been sitting on my furniture , " she said . " I 'm here to find Cleon Wilson , " I said . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lay off , " he said . " That 's my husband , girl , " she said . " What 's your name ? " I asked . " I 'm not stupid , " she said . " I keep my mouth shut . " Abruptly he ducked behind her , twisting her arm . It was too sudden . I could n't believe my eyes . She pitched forward at the waist and screamed , " You stupid  --  " I moved toward them to help her . But then I stopped . I am not always as brave as I 'd like . She kept screaming while he dragged her out of the room . " Let me go , let me go , I 'll kill you for this one . " I ran six steps to the front door , listening to the smacking and thumping . I unlocked it and opened the screen door . " What was her white ass doing here ? " the woman shouted . " I 'm telling you  --  lay off . " She screamed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up and punched you in the mouth . " Then she screamed louder . " Fuck , you 're hurting me . " I doubled up my fists and shouted , " Stop it or I 'm calling the police . " The house was silent . Then she ran out of the kitchen , swing/ing a wood-handled hammer with both hands above her head . " No cops , no white ass in my house . " There was no mistaking the fact that she was dying to use the hammer . I ducked when she threw it . It hit the door behind me and then bounced off my right shoulder blade . I backed out the door , my fingers pulling at my stinging muscle . " You come back here and I 'll kill you and him , " she shouted . As I ran to the Dodge the boy stuck out his palm . " Pay up . " My legs were shaking . " Let me inside the car . " My voice washarsh . I opened the door , got in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . My fingers trembled , and I heard myself panting . I passed the boy a dollar bill through a small opening in the window . Just then the woman ran out of the front door . She was still screaming and swinging the hammer above her head . The boy ran . I turned the key and started the motor just as she hit the hack window a terrible blow . The sound went through me . Glass sprayed through the car , and I kicked the gas pedal to the floor . The car screeched and wobbled for the next two blocks . I jammed the brakes at the red light . My hand went to my hair . I stared at tiny bits of glass on my fingers . I was shaking . I wanted to call my editor . The woman had been a freak accident . But I 'd survived . She 'd missed my face and all I 'd have would be a bad bruise on my shoulder . I drove a mile before I convinced myself I had lost her . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pay telephones . I checked out the back of the car . The seat was covered with glass . I put through a collect call to the newspaper . I needed to talk to Marty Burns . I did n't just want comfort  --  I had news to report . The towheadedblond kid in the beach snapshot with Mineo came back to me . I wished I 'd taken the photograph back from Marty . Then there was Jonathan 's jealousy of Chris . Annie Harmon saw a blond kid running from Mineo 's body . Why was Mineo 's apartmentlit up while he was on his way home ? Maybe somebody was in there waiting . And I wondered if any of this connected to Jerry Lee Johnson 's talk about the blond ( hide who braggedp115that he killed somebody famous in Hollywood for some cocaine dealers . But the switchboard was busy . I called Joe in New York , collect . I was surprised how much I wanted to hear him telling me everything was all right . I figured he 'd be happy I escaped harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Watts alone in the first place . That was what I was wondering myself . Once Joe told me , " You run too hard . You tried too hard to be a student . Now you overdo the active life because you want to make up for lost time . Take it easy . " The operator let the phone in the apartment ring ten times . " Your party does n't answer . " Then Joe picked up the telephone . " Oh , hi . I ca n't talk , " he said . I almost said something mean . But that was n't fair . " Sara , I 'll ring your hotel later , " he said . It sounded as if he were n't alone . " Yeah , sure , " I said . I hung up and frowned at a boy hosing down a Triumph in the sun . Water dribbled along the cement toward me . Then I called him back . " Joe , I 'm scared , " I said , closing the folding glass door to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I heard clatter in the background . Somebodywas there . " Maybe you were right about this story , " I said , swallowing . " Two people have tried to hurt me , and  --  " " Sara , what 's that mean ? " He sounded scared . " Well , some guy hit me at the airport out here . He 's got guns  --  " " Where 'd he hit you ? " " In the stomach , but its okay . " " Jesus Christ , what else ? " " A woman in Watts chased me with a hammer . " " Did she hurt you ? " " Not that much , " I hedged . " Do n't go near them again . " He sounded mad . " You hear me ? If you do , I 'm telling that city editor of yours to find another fool to run his errands . " It felt good hearing him get angry on my behalf . " Sara , you listening ? " He sounded scared again.  | " Yeah , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Call me later , and take it easy tonight . You got to live to type another article , right ? " " Right . " On the second try I got Marty Burns . " I got a lead , " he said . " Got a pencil ? " I always have a pencil . This was a little joke . He was saying , " Mineo left a party right before he was murdered , at the home of Kate Lyons , somewhere at the beach . She 's that big-deal producer . Here 's her private telephone number . I hear nobody 's listed out there . " He gave me the number , shouted something , and then asked me , " Everything fine ? " I wanted to run down everything but it was too early . Instead , I said , " Lots of pieces floating around . " " Talk to you tomorrow , " he said . So I called Kate Lyons . Three male secretaries put me on hold until she got on the line . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He did n't know me very well , " she said . " We talked once . " " I 'd like to talk to you . " I emphasized the word " you . " It sounded like she needed that . " Well , I always accommodate the press . I 'll tell you about my new rock picture . You can have twenty minutes tomorrow afternoon . But call me first , so I can make sure I 'm on schedule , " she said , and hung up.  |p117Before  I went to sleep that afternoon , I called Mark and told him I was too tired to show up for dinner . " I got some red Dexedrine , " he said . " Pumps lightning in your brain . " His voice was soothing . " I run on my own speed , " I said . " Okay . Dinner 'll wait , later , whenever . On your own speed , " he said , and gave me directions to his home in Laurel Canyon . I woke up two hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunset , watching the neon lights of the burlesque shows . I sniffed at my wrist . I have this idiosyncrasy . Sometimes I wear Joy perfume . There 's something about the way it reminds me of a single rose in a crystal vase . It 's known as the most expensive perfume in the world . I have a tiny vial , and when I spray it on my skin , I feel chic . Dowager chic . Women who wear it are over fifty-five and rich . But the vial does n't cost any more than a fancy meal at a French restaurant . And it lasts longer . I turned on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and left the flatness of Hollywood to drive up into the hills . Trees and plants grew wild and messy . I saw small mountain houses lit by front-door lights . Barefoot kids and dogs played on knolls in front of open garages filled with pickup trucks , tools , and boats . I 'd stumbled on a rural mountain town.  |p118At  ten-thirty , I parked my car next to his old white Cadillac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill that loomed against the panorama of city lights . It was a relief to stop and rest . This place was calm and close to the dark sky . I locked up the Dodge . Stupid , considering the back window was gone . It was so dark I could n't see the ground . I walked two steps on the pavement and then stopped . I heard something that made my skin crawl . Somebody else took two steps and then stopped . I took another step . I heard another step . I put an arm out in front of me and cleared my throat . " Hello ? " Nobody answered . I heard two more steps , and then a car door opened and closed . I turned and looked behind me . There was another car somewhere in the clearing . I finally saw a dark shape on the other side of Mark 's lumpy Cadillac . There was no motor sound , but I heard tires crunching on the cement . The car was rolling downhill . I heard brakes and the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange car . From a lot of practice straining to see if taxicabs were available , I thought I could see two people sitting there . " Lady , what 's this street ? " I jumped at his voice . I could n't see his face . I wondered how long they 'd been parked there . It was fishy . Then I saw only one person inside the car . That meant the other one was near me in the dark clearing . I directed my voice at the car , and measured the distance between me and the path up to Mark 's house . " It 's Wonderland Avenue . " " Yeah ? " one voice said . " What 's your name , hon ? " " My name is my business , " I said . " Lady , you in trouble ? " he asked , and then I saw him standing next to the car . He looked tall , but I could n't tell much . The car was a Mercedes sedan . " No , are you in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , " he said . " I 'll remember that one . " My heart started to beat fast as I watched him get inside the Mercedes and slowly back away . Without headlights , I could n't read his license plates . I listened to the sound of his motor grow and then blend withp119the crickets , birds , and far-off cars of Los Angeles . My nerves were shot , but I got inside what looked like a small waist-high cage at the foot of the hill . It was a cable car that traveled on a diagonal up the mountain to Mark 's house . I felt like a lost tourist . I closed my eyes and felt the outdoor elevator sway as it climbed . When it stopped , I stood there alone , facing his front door . I looked down the steep hill . I could n't see my car . I needed time to think . A door slammed and there was Mark in dungarees , his hair wet . With his hair flattened down , his eyes looked bigger and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lucky thing I learned to read road maps in junior high school . " I followed him into his house . " I got back ten minutes ago , " he said . " Took a quick shower . " " Oh , listen , " I said , " who uses that parking area down there ? " " Why ? What happened ? " He shot me a fast look over hisshoulder . " I just wondered . " " Nobody but me , " he said , his voice cracking . " Why ? " He did n't bother to close the front door . I stopped and slammed it . " What 's going on ? " he asked , smoothing his hair . Instead of answering , I walked past him into his living room and flopped down on a leather sofa , trying to look calm . I did n't want to upset him more . " Tell me everything , " he commanded , and sat down facing me on the edge of his wooden coffee table . I pulled my chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys down there . " I pointed my thumb over my shoulder . His eyes jumped away . " In a car . They scared me . " " Where ? " " In your parking lot . " " Hollywood types ? " " No , not really . " " Cops , " he snorted . He paced away and turned down the red gas flame in the fireplace  | " How do you know they 're cops ? " I asked abruptly . " They been tailing me all week , " he said , walking toward me . " Forget it . " My shoulders got tight . He could be wrong . The guy who slugged me at the airport had disappeared into a Mercedes . I could n't tell if the guy in the Mercedes tonight had the same voice . Through the windows I looked down on the lights of Los Angeles , and felt vertigo , as though I was flying toward the city in an airplane . The ceiling had wooden beams . The soft light in the room came from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room . " Why do you live up here ? " I asked , after a minute . " You want the bullshit response ? " Mark sat facing me again on the coffee table . I turned my knees to one side to avoid bumpinghis . " Yeah , then the real answer , " I said . " First , because I 'm a country boy , and second , because there was a time I hung out with lots of musicians , and they live up here . " " But you do n't hang out with them now ? " " Hope , I like my own company . " He was resting his chin on his palm and staring past me at the fire . " How many rooms do you have ? " I asked . " Twelve , not counting bathrooms , " he said , walking away again to put a Beethoven quartet on the record player . He walked around the room , lighting candles on the floor against the walls . " I thought the place was torn apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows . " The cleaning woman comes every day . " He picked up the telephone . " Forgot to call my service . Sal and I used the same service , Kelly O'Toole , and sometimes I got his messages for him because we had the same operator . " I felt like I might fall out the windows into the city lights . Mark was listening to the operator and writing . " Oh , yeah , at Universal ? . . . Right , I 'll call Kate at Burbank . " I got a brainstorm . " Mark , listen to me . " I jumped up and pulled on his loose shirt cuff . " Find out if there are any messagesfor Sal Mineo. "  |p121He  sat down slowly and we locked eyes . " Alice , babe , " he asked , " got anything on 659-2032 ? . . . Right . Sure , I 'll report them to the cops , and it 's cool . Just check Serpentine Productions . " He covered the receiver with one palm . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbled for a minute , hung up , and handed me a list of messages : 2/11 , Jim at the Westwood Playhouse has all your house tickets . ( i i P.M. ) 2/12 , Mark Loren says maybe dinner at Lucy 's after the beach party . ( 12:15 P.M. ) 2/12 , David Lyons . ( 1:30 A.M. ) 2/12 , Chris , call as soon as you get home . ( 6:1 o A.M. ) 2/12 , Kate Lyons says to meet her at the beach today after lunch . She 's not going to the office , so do n't bother calling Burbank. ( 10 A.M. ) " Let me see the time on that , " he said , pulling the paper out of my hand . It was the morning of the murder . " That 's funny , " I said . " What 're you thinking ? " I did n't tell him that Kate Lyons told me she 'd met Sal Mineo only once . But then Mark said , " Sal did n't say he was meeting with Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things from each other . That 's the way I saw it , anyway . " He frowned down at the page . " How do you know Kate ? " I asked . " She 's this producer , " Mark said . " Who 's David Lyons ? " Either David Lyons and Mineo were awful close or he had problems  --  late-night problems . He shrugged . " Big producer . Used to be married to Kate Lyons , " and he walked out of the living room . I found him in the kitchen , grating cheese into milk steaming in a double boiler . I leaned my hip against the butcher block table . Watching somebody cook puts me in a trance . It 's calming . The concoctionlooked like baby food . I folded and unfolded the messages . " What 's Chris like ? " " The interview begins , " he said . I could n't see his expression ,  |p122because  he was bent over the stove , his hair bouncing down on his face as he rubbed the cheese against the grater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral . I saw what Sal saw . " " I saw you and him at the funeral . " Mark changed the subject . " I told you how I was always cookingfor Sal . Black-eyed peas , candied yams , and French stuff too . Otherwise he ate junk food . It 's sure nice to cook for somebody again . " I like junk food , " I said . " It 's my vice . " " I bet . " He laughed . " What 's so funny ? " " Nothing , " he said . I asked , " How did you meet Sal ? " He covered his eyes . Then he went back to beating the cheese and milk in silence . " You feel okay ? " I asked him . He threw the whisk against the wall . The eggwhite splattered and hissed on the stove . " I 'm real tired . " His voice shook . " Maybe you better go . " " I want to stay , " I said . He looked strained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking hard , and I ca n't do it solo . Sal and me , we tell it together . " " Well , you 're not by yourself , " I said . " Oh , yeah , " he said , " right . I 'm with you and you 're wrappedup in cellophane . I see you looking down your nose at me . " Hewas cleaning the eggwhite off the wall with his bare hand . " It 's the opposite  --  " " Shit , " he said . " I know much more than you do . " " About what ? " " Sex , feelings . " " Maybe , " I said . " You think sex is dirty . " There was a harsh sound to his voice . " You think gay people are disgusting . Sal said some people are special  --  everything about them is attractive  --  and to everybody . But you do n't get it . Why am I wasting my time ? " " Stop it , " 1 blurted out . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to a good story . It hits me like an infatuation or a bad cold . " " Sure , sure enough , " and he stopped talking.  |p123Dinner  was silent , and over in ten minutes . I ate fast , sitting at a coffee table . Mark unrolled his linen napkin , poured wine into his goblet , ground pepper into his fettucine , and then he looked at his lap . He said nothing and ate nothing . Afterward he walked over and sprinkled dry food into his fish tank . I watched the fish wriggle for it , and then I opened a photographalbum to a picture of Sal Mineo glowering at the camera , his collar turned up , his hair greased . " That 's not really him , " I said . " Hey , you 're right , " he said , and sat down next to me . He reached over and turned the page . There was Sal , sitting on Mark 's leather couch , a book in his lap . He wore wire-rimmed glasses and a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " That 's right , " he repeated . " Sal played a lot of hood parts , but you like him right , the way he was . " Another picture showed Nell Fields aiming a wineglass at the camera . " Her favorite way of getting attention , " he said . The next picture showed Nell , Sal Mineo , and James Dean , barefoot , in rolled-up dungarees , at a beach barbecue . They were laughing , with their arms around each other 's backs . Mineo 's hair was blowing in the wind . Nell wore pigtails . " She was in love with him , " Mark said , " but possessive , and that 's why he broke it off . Because of her , he could n't have his cake and eat it too . " I must have looked confused . " I know what you 're thinking , " he said . " But Sal knew how to turn folks on . Man or woman . He made folks feel special , because he made them love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him seduction was a daily act  --  oh , I do n't mean only sex  --  but see , an actor needs to feel the heat of people loving him . It was Sal 's talent . He listened to you like he had a goddamnthird ear , and once he learned what it was you loved , he 'd become that . He changed colors like a lizard in the circus . " " Was it like a game ? " I asked . " It was dead serious . For him , it was just natural , like some folks are good at making you laugh . "  | " How did he do it with you ? " Mark raised both eyebrows . " We were easy . It was n't anything like work . We 'd just please each other because we hated the same stuff and loved the good stuff . " I asked , " How did he feel about you ? " Mark looked angry . " Sara , no matter what you think , I hear a million things from a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who taught me my looks belong to me . It was like freedom . " " So he made you special , " I said slowly . " Look , you got to be wondering about Sal and me . " Mark hooked his thumbs in his dungaree pockets and paced around the couch . It sounded as if he 'd thought about it a lot . " Rudolph Valentino is a hero to us , and was he gorgeous-looking . But in his hometown they'd 've locked him up  --  the local pervert . He broke the rules , with great style . " He was steaming . " You tell me all about Rock Hudson , Janis Joplin , Errol Flynn . The public does n't know how they 've lived . Everybody loves them . We know all about them and we do n't give a shit . " " So you have different standards ? " " We got no standards , " he said . " We do n't need them . Take Ramon Navarro . He died in bed right smack between two brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presley did n't particularly like anybody touching him or having sex . But he liked two ladies tucking him in at night . " " So what 's the point ? " I asked . I noticed he had n't mentioned many musicians . I wondered if his lecture was about Sal Mineo 's life more than his own . " The point is , these people are loved . Folks love them . They love themselves . We do n't put them down . We envy their sexiness . We figure their vices are part of their thing . " " Well , now what are you trying to say ? " I asked . " Jesus , I thought I said it , " he said shortly . " What ? " " That if something is beautiful , I want to touch it . If something is peaceful , I want to contemplate it . If something 's cold , I want to make it warm . It is n't bad . It is n't good . " " I try not to pass judgment , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , you 're about twentysix , right ? "  | " Yes . " I guessed he was twenty-three . " Well , you 're still growing , girl . " " Look , tell me about Sal Mineo and I 'll try to keep my mind open . " I sounded too formal . I was sitting up too straight on the edge of his couch . " Beauty is its own excuse , " Mark said distractedly . He paced to the other end of the couch and looked out over the lights . " In a way , " I said . He cleared his throat and spoke more firmly . " So why 's it more disgusting for people of the same sex to be touching each other than for really ugly people ? " " It 's not aesthetics , " I said , and sprawled back on the couch . " What is it , then ? Masters and Johnson say it 's no big deal who you make love to , " Mark said in the dark . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made love to men ? " Mark said . " It leaves me out , " I said , looking down at my fingers and flexing them . This conversation was embarrassing . " Anyway , it 's biological . We got permission to have sex from our parents , but with the opposite sex . " " Did you get permission ? " Mark turned away from the window . I folded my fingers in my lap . " But it 's just not right , " I said suddenly . " Gays do n't have kids . " " Maybe enough folks are making babies , " Mark said . He looked back at the lights . " Let me tell you something . I was fourteen when I met Sal . I hitched out here to get somebody to listen to my tunes , and it 's a long way up here from down in South Carolina . I was born in Louisville , but we moved when I was little to a beautiful place with pastures and woods near Charleston . You 're funny , because you remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but Dad wanted me to sit home and read . I slept out in the woods in a hammock . Then Mom died and Dad gave up trying to keep us a family and shipped me to this depressing boarding school . I ran away with this kid Jeffrey and lived with his folks in Bel Air , and we roamed around like we had all the time there is . His folks let us be , so afternoons we went to the beach and nights we hung out on the Strip . I was a show-off on my guitar , figuring I 'd get myself discovered . " He laughed quietly.  | " I 'll never forget the first time I saw him sitting there on a motorcycle outside the Old World . I was so excited . It was Sal Mineo . I followed him on down the Strip to a club called the Interlude . It was a jazz club . Lenny Bruce used to play there . I 'd seen Rebel , and I was the right age . I drank five Cokes , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed again . " Then one day down at the beach I was playing this lullaby I made up and I looked up and he was standing there staring at me . " " What were you playing ? " I asked . I wished I could see the expression on his face . But he was hiding by the window . " I do n't know . I 'll tell you about Sal . It 's like some people have a spotlight wherever they go . " That was something Mark had  --  a spotlight . " What did you look like then ? " Mark slid across the couch and started thumbing through his photograph album . " I had a picture of myself . When I showed it to Sal last Christmas , he said he 'd do anything to meet the kid in the picture . " " He was kidding , " I said , watching his face tighten in profile over the album . " I guess . " " After the beach you made friends ? " " We hooked up when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't belong to anybody . " He blinked hard , and handed me the photograph . Mark had been a completely winningboy . His hair hung down to his shoulders , but he had the same scared black eyes , sweet mouth , and thin face with planed cheekbones . I liked the way he looked today . His shoulders and arms were filled out . He stared at the photograph , his voice straining . " I 'd give anything to find him again . I 'm twenty-five and I 'd give my life to be fourteen again . " " No . " " Yes , dammit . " He folded the photograph down the middleuntil the picture cracked . Then he folded it again . It was ruined . " I 'll never forget the night he asked me back to his place , andI went , scared as a jackrabbit . But in my whole life , nobody evermade me feel so special . He wanted to know every damn thingp127about me  --  my music , my family  --  and he said maybe I wrote lullabies because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were about missing her . He asked me if I was scared girls would disappear on me like my mom did . He said my songs made him feel better about living or something , and he asked me about my old man , so I told him how he teaches legal philosophy and does n't talk a whole lot to me or anybody . " " My morn 's a teacher . " " She talk to you ? " " Not really , " I said , looking at him curiously . I 'd never thought of it that way . He stood up , tossed his hair off his face , and said , " Sal was in a phase , working on that play Fortune and Men 's Eyes , about boys in prison . He showed me his house , and it was one weird place . He had prison bars on one wall . Sal lived in about ten different houses since I met him . Further and further inland . " " Where ( lid he live the first time ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door to Peter Lawford and the Lyonses . He loved the beach . He did n't have any furniture , just this huge Harley Davidson . He did n't like leaving it outside because to him it was a real pretty piece of art . He was rolling high . A year before , he 'd made a thousand dollars a day doing The Greatest Story Ever Told . I think he worked ninety days . That adds up to ninety thousand . " I picked up the folded picture of Mark and put it in my pocket . Mark reached for a twelve-string guitar lying on top of the mantle , and strummed it . In the light from the fireplace I saw his black hair , dry now , curling down his forehead . He kept plucking the same melody , walking around in the shadows . " Today I 'd know better . But I was thrilled because we were going to stay up and talk . I thought , Oh , damn , my first real conversation with a famous guy . ' " When I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , It 's better than being a telephone repairman . All you need is a relationship to your aspirations and you got it made . ' " He asked me did I want to see his house . I said okay , and he followed me into the bedroom , and the bed was huge , man . " He told me , Go on and try it . ' So I sit down and bounce a few times and we smoke some joints , and I feel dizzy and realp128special . It 's like being in the best damn movie ever made , starring Sal Mineo and me . I start giggling and singing , When you wish upon a star , ' a Hollywood movie star , and he loved it , and nobody ever liked me like that . " Mark was standing by the window , and I saw his silhouette against the gray night sky . He sounded unsteady , but he kept talking . " He sits down next to me on the bed . I want to hug him because I 'm having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I tune it , and he asks me to play a song of mine he liked . " " Which one ? " I realized I was holding my breath . " Desert Places . ' I look up and Sal 's staring in my eyes and he looks real kind , and he 's saying , Mark , I like you a lot , and it 's a shame you do n't swing . ' " I jump off that bed , because I 'm sure he 's saying I 'm boring him . But I want to spend time with him more than anything . " So I say , Oh , but Sal , I do swing , I really do , and when I get to know people I can be real crazy . Honest . ' " Suddenly Mark took his guitar strap off and laid the instrumentback on his mantle . He walked over to me , knelt down , and put his face next to mine . He touched my cheek with one fingertipand then looked from my mouth to my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . " Sal 's talking to me and looking like this , like he 's taming a kitten . Swing with me , ' he says , Swing with me . ' " : Mark rocked back on his heels . " I feel this buzz running all over my body ... " " And ? " " And fadeout , sugar . " I waited and asked , " Then you two saw a lot of each other ? " " No way . I freaked . I ran far away . " " Then what happened ? " " You sure like to keep a conversation moving . " " I want to understand , " I said . He rolled his eyes , ambled over to the fireplace , and turned the gas jets off . The flame disappeared , and Mark 's voice quickenedin the darkened room . " Well , Jeff , this kid I was staying with , said Sal called a couple times , and I did n't call him back , but one day I answered thep129phone and it was him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk , and I said flat out I never wanted to see him again . " I told him I never did sex before . He sputtered and said , But Mark , you said you swing . ' " I told him I thought swing meant being fun , and then he was quiet for a long time . Finally , he said we 'd had a bad misunderstanding , and he told me he 'd arranged for me to put my tunes on a record . I figured he was jiving me . " " Was he serious ? " " He was , and the tape Sal made was a hit , and a lot of folks got rich , but he never took a dime . " He sang , a little quickly , under his breath , in the husky Southernvoice , a song from his album " Desert Places " that I heard over and over on cab radios : " . . . love , what are you doing to my friends ? " This time I was really intimidated . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't ask . It was like demanding a gift . Instead , I asked , " What did Sal say when you both told your friends about how you met ? " " Well , it 's going to freak you out . " " Try me , " I said . " Well , Sal said I was like hot butterscotch and poetry , but I do n't know . " Mark ducked his head , embarrassed . " How did you feel ? " " Well , I felt like dying from pleasure . I mean , I was getting new feelings , and it was my first time . " " What feelings ? " I was sure he would n't answer me . " What feelings ? " His voice had a mocking sound . Then he flopped down next to me on the sofa , his legs straight out in front of him . He recited in a dramatic monotone , " Oh , please , more , to the left , higher , harder . It hurts . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning his head in my direction he said , " Okay ? " I 'd never heard anybody speak so much about sex . It made me a little frantic . " Then what happened ? " " An hour later I felt like I was more dead than alive . I ran away . " I kept thinking that the whole thing was n't fair . Gay men pickp130out the best-looking boys . Mark needed somebody to protect him . " Hey , girl , " Mark said , still looking straight ahead , " where 's your tape recorder ? " " I ca n't forget this , " I said . " I 'm making a dumb joke , " he said . " This is n't for publication . " I opened my mouth to argue , and closed it . Most of the candles around the room had burned out . Mark got his guitar off the mantle again and was playing another melody line . Then he combined it with blues licks . Then he was singing the last verse . I loved his voice. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to soften love . Listen to my fingers on your mouth . He hesitated . " Keep me company . Stay the night . I got extra bedrooms . " " Thanks , but I better get back to the hotel . " " I 'll make us a hot-oatmeal breakfast . " I shook my head . It was n't the kind of thing I do . I sure looked up to him . I was so curious . But staying overnight would make me feel like a groupie . I did n't figure him to be making a pass . I read books on sexuality . I was n't his type , although everything in his life seemed topsy-turvy . He looked lost . I do n't know why I started nodding yes . Maybe it was because I am so snoopy . Maybe it was because my day had almost killed me . I was tired . My bedroom was filled with electronic music equipment . I touched the polished wood of an electrified cello . There was a Moog synthesizer , something that looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dials . Mark gave me a blue silk shirt from the closet . " This is supposed to be the composing room , " he said . " But it does n't get a whole lot of use . " I had a twinge of sympathy for him . He was out of the room for a few seconds before he knocked and came back in.  | " I want you to know , " he said , looking down at his hand twistingthe doorknob , " I want to be your good friend . We 're not alike , but you 're steady , and you wo n't lie and get tricky on me . I ca n't take any of that right now . " " Friends ? " I said . " What 's wrong with that ? " he asked . " Well , the truth is , we could be friends , but .. . well , there'salways work , and it comes first . " My voice sounded too defensive . He gave me one of his fast looks . " Do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sex or something . " I expect a good night 's sleep , " I snapped . He smiled for the first time . " You 're an honest soul , and I appreciate it . " I sighed and thought of the whispers that had passed between him and Jonathan at the bar and between him and Chris at the funeral , and of the two threatening guys in the Mercedes . " Then why 're you hiding things from me ? " He shot me another intense glance , and then he was looking at the floor and running his fingers through his hair . " I do the best I can , " he said . " Listen , tell me one thing  --  what was on the page you ripped out of that screenplay ? " " Nothing much . Want to see it ? " He disappeared and handed it to me when he returned a few seconds later . I tried to decipher the handwriting . " Why did you rip it out ? " He was chewing on his lower lip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to Sal . " " Do you remember a card from a loan agency ? " " No , ma'am . " " It probably fell out when I dropped it , " I said . " I hope that cop did n't get it . " The notes on the page looked as if they 'd been written in a car . I folded it and put it into my purse . After he left , I felt too tired to take a shower . So I threw my clothes onto the cello case and buttoned up the silk shirt he gave me . It smelled of cologne . It hung down to my knees . Then I heard a scream of pure terror , like the cry of an animal . I heard him through the door of the bedroom . I heard my name.  |p132I  dashed like a lunatic through hallways and into one room filled with musical instruments . Mark seemed to be screaming from somewhere both inside and outside the house . Finally I ran back across the living room and past the fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bare feet . I found him sitting in the dark at the foot of his bed . Half-naked . He was doubled over as if there were something wrong with his stomach . He kept moaning to himself . I bent over to look at his face , but he pushed my arms away . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . " Look at this place , " he said . I turned on a lamp . " Jesus , " I said . It was a shambles . Dresser drawers had been pulled out . The telephone cord had been yanked from the wall . The bottom half of his curtains were burned and spread out against the rising winds blowing through the open window . A table lamp had been thrown against the wall of mirror . The overhead light had been smashed . The blanket and bedspread were ripped . There was a knife stuck in the headboard . I reached to pull it out and something fell down onto a pillow . I fumbled for it and felt something wet . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow I saw the knife had been stuck into a distendedcondom filled with a dark red liquid . I gagged and wiped my fingers on the sheet . He jumped up , strode to the closet , and wrenched the door open . " Who 's been here ? " he mumbled . " Who 's here ? " He circled his room twice , kicking at the charred curtains , pullingopen other dresser drawers . " It 's my house , " he said . " It 's my goddamn house . " He kicked the bedroom door open , and I jumped at the noise . Then he sat down on the side of the mattress . I sank down on the floor in front of him and put my arms around his knees . He had to calm down . Then I was embarrassed because I was wearing only the blue silk shirt and underpants . But he did n't notice . " When did this happen ? " I asked , checking the buttons of my shirt . They were secure , but my fingers were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out before , " he said.  |p133He  broke away from me and lay down on his bed . " You should n't be here . It 's just too dangerous . " " I 'm worried about you , " I said . " Let 's call the police . " " Call the police ! " I picked up the telephone . " It 's dead . " " Hang it up , then , " he shouted . " Maybe it was those guys in the parking lot , " I said . Mark was n't listening . " Are you okay ? " he asked . " We have to go to the police . " " No way . " " Mark , does that Sergeant Casey know about the other time this place was torn apart ? " I wondered if he was trying to figure out how much I knew about his problems . " Answer me , " I said . " No , " he said . " What 's going on ? " I asked . " Does it have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beach ? " It was just a guess , but he got the same puzzled look on his face as when he heard the message from Sal Mineo 's answering service . " No , " he said , " and it 's nothing I ca n't handle myself . " " Let me help , " I said . " You told Chris something about it that day at the funeral . You can tell me . " I could n't help but snatch a second or two of pleasure from the way he looked at me . He did seem to respect my ability to piece stuff together . " Well , I do n't want you writing this . " " Tell me , " I said , " trust me . " " Two people roughed me up and said they would kill me if I told the cops . " " Oh , God , " I said , " did they hurt you ? " " No . " " Well , who were they ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room . " They must be after something . " " What ? " " I do n't know . " I believed him and I did n't believe him . " What about thep134cops ? Maybe it was them , " I said . I did n't say that someone could have come from murdering Sal directly to Mark 's house . Annie Harmon said Sal Mineo 's lights were on . That same thief might have been looking for something inside Sal Mineo 's house the night of the murder and in here earlier tonight . I followed him to the front door where he walked outside and did something to lock the elevator . The hallway was dark . I did n't know what it looked like in the light . I wished I 'd had a better look at the guys lurking in the Mercedes . I heard a bolt snap . We were alone in the house  --  I hoped . I led the way back into his bedroom . Behind me , he brushed his hand along my shoulder as if to reassure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hugged him lightly after he touched me . He felt so thin . I closed my eyes when we got to his bedroom . I did n't feel like looking at the mess around us . He sat down next to me on the bed . His leg was touching mine . It was as much from shock as anything . I took his hands . " Mark , who 's doing all this to you ? " " I do n't know . Do n't ask me . " He slid his hands away . " Sara , you have such red hair . Did you always have red hair ? " He touched my hair . It was a soft pat . He was tentative . Iheard a new intensity in his voice , but it was just a breath . " I 'd better go , " I said , but I did n't move . He was stroking my head . I wanted to arch my back like a cat and push my head against his hand . He said , " The old man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't even say it in words . Somebody has broken into this house twice . I got me some trouble . " He was looking at me and not seeing me . " He was the first person I loved , and now I 'm fucked . I could always talk myself back to sanity with Sal . " I put my hand on the back of his neck to comfort him . He grew still . I closed my eyes against the guarded expression on his face . His elbows were locked against his body . I wondered what he looked like naked . He wiggled his arm behind me and pulled me close . " What is it we 're doing here ? " he asked . I pulled back , but he held me . I wondered if this was the firstp135time he thought about making love to me . It was terrifying . I stood up and put my palms over my eyes . It was one thing to hang around here because I was a reporter . That was my invisible shield . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous musician who was probably gay . Reporters do n't judge , they just ingratiate and soak up facts , feelings . But people in my family judge . I judge . And this was stupid . He asked , " Do you want me to make love to you ? Do you ? Say it to me . Tell me how you 're feeling . What do you want me to do , Sara ? " I started toward the bedroom door . " I want to think about it . " He was n't my boyfriend . He was a stranger . Mark laughed dryly . " You do n't want to stop and think about it , " and he pulled me back toward the bed . My knees collapsed and I sat down again . He ran his fingers over my face , stopping to make a circle on my mouth . It made no sense , but whatever he said sounded right . I felt as if he were touching me all over . I could not believe it . I was so curious . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt something change . It felt large and far away , like the movement of an ocean . But it was n't far away . I would n't be the same again . He was right . I wanted him to keep going . But I never do anything that might turn out badly . I wanted to feel his skin . I knew it would be smooth . I wanted to see the curve of his buttocks . 1 wanted to see if he had an erection . I could n't tell him . I was scared to death . I felt ashamed . " What about you ? " I asked . " No , I want you to tell me . " I did n't think men who made love to men wanted women at all . Maybe he was bisexual . He probably did n't want to make love the normal way . This was some awful tease . I was like two different people . On the one hand I knew what I wanted , and it was something new . I wanted to watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , I wanted to escape him . I did n't move . Then I wanted something else . It was so huge , I did n't knowp136how to negotiate for it . I 'd always been polite . I 'd always felt good when Joe had a good time . Now I was unnerved , caught in overpowering feelings . I closed my eyes and almost moaned . The ground was unsteady . " You know what I want , " I said . " What ? " He lowered his eyes with a small smile . He knew his power . " What is it ? " " I want to be with you . " " Not unless you tell me how . " " What do you mean ? " " I want specific instructions . " " What instructions ? " " I want you to talk to me about sex  --  ' harder , more , over there '  --  stuff like that . " " That 's crazy . " I covered my ears . I should n't hear this . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why should I ? " I asked . " Because it 'll make you feel good and it 'll make me feel good to make you feel good . " He was right . It would be amazing for me to ask . I 'd never done it before . I pulled him back on the bed . " Take my clothes off , " he said , lying clown behind me . Instead of speaking , I stood on my knees and pulled off his dungarees . Mark had long swimmer 's muscles , narrow hips , and sunbleached hair on his thighs and calves . He wore no underwear , so I pulled his pants over his erect sex organ , and stopped . He still lay on his side , his lips in a trembling smile . He looked beautiful . I saw pale skin , the triangle of soft hair , the place where his bathing suit had blocked the sun . There was no hair on his chest . I leaned over and touched theil11 smooth gold skin of his pectoral muscles . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolled onto his side , facing me . I had never touched such a perfect body . I sat up and tentatively stroked him . His shoulders were full . I reached over him . The muscles of his buttocks were hard and I traced them down his thighs . I lay down on my side and we looked at each other . I could n't stand the tension . I was still dressed . He was smiling gently . He was giving me permission to play games I had never thought of . I was trying to hold back my breath . I felt as if I 'd been run/ping hard . I did n't want to frighten him with the ferocity of my feelings . " Now what ? " He was teasing me . " What ? " " What-all 's going on ? " he asked . " I have these feelings , " I said , and curled one hand around the other . " Tell me where to touch you , " he said , patting my fingers until they relaxed . I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vagina " sounds like my gynecologist . " Where ? " he said . I rejected " clitoris . " " There , " I finally said . " The words are beautiful because we 're beautiful , " he said sternly . I could n't speak . " Take my hand and put it there , " he said . I do n't know what it was that made me trust him enough to obey him . I surrendered , in a way . Like he was a swimming teacher who could make me believe I was n't going to drown when I dived into water over my head . So I did the unimaginable . I put his hand under my underpants . Then I heard myself moan . I had never been touched so sensitively . He knew what caused me pleasure better than I did . Then he stopped . " Kiss me , " he said . After a moment , I kissed his mouth lightly . I was holding back . I wanted him too much . It seemed wrong . I had n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marty Burns . Then I forgot everything else . He had n't moved . His lips were relaxed . " Come on , " he said . " More . " I strained against him , holding my breasts a few inches away from his chest . I felt awkward . Then he rolled onto his back and pulled me on top of him . I felt his chest , his mouth , his thighs , his knees pressing back against me , and we rolled over again . I no longer felt awkward . I tried to lie still under him . But my mind took over again . He was a fantasy I had n't dared to have . " This is my cock , " he said . He put my hand there . The hard flesh trembled  | " Oh , God , " he said . It was hard to stay embarrassed in front of him . He showed no shame . " You have to express what you feel . " I heard the impatience in his voice . " Tell me to take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put my cock inside you . " " I want  --  " but my voice went away . After he undressed me he touched me all over with both hands as though he was a blind person who was learning me through my body . He took a long time with me . I was out of control . Then he kissed me all over with his tongue . I had no secrets left . I worried that he was too calm . I told him . I was babbling . He put his head between my legs and teased me with flicks of his tongue  --  hard and soft  --  until my body was thrashing around . " I want you to make love to me , " I said . " Come up here . " He tossed his hair and put his head down again . His voice was muffled against my body . " Good , " he said . " Tell me again . " " I want to watch you . I want to feel you . " All I felt was his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body had floated away . I started to cry and then stopped . He lifted his head to see why I had become so still . He was crying too , and when I saw his tears I began to sob . I felt we were moving forward on a single track , locked in tight symmetry . When I finally felt him move inside me , he forced me to stop and look at his face . His mouth was shaking . I shook , frightened at my feelings . " It 's okay , " he said , and cradled my head with both arms . Then we started to move together . The friction we made was like a song . It was pure pleasure . I began to worry that this would end . Then I forgot I was worried . I was moving all over him . I became one long spasm until he moved with new urgency . A soft electric current shot through my body . I wanted to watch his face . With both hands , I pulled his head up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked from my mouth to my eyes and back to my mouth . I was so pleased . He murmured , " I love the way you smell . You smell like the wind at the beach . You 're new to me. "  | " I know  --  " I said , and lost my voice again . " Most girls smell like shampoo , " he said , " but you 're special . " He stared into my eyes , his pupils shaking . " You love this . " I hid my head in his shoulder . He pulled my chin up . " Say it , " he ordered me . " I love this , " I said . I grabbed his shoulders and almost shook him . Then he shook me back and groaned , his breath harsh in my ear . Then he relaxed . I lay still under him . I was waiting to see what he would do next . My body was wet where it touched him . He kissed my ear and grunted . Then I relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and folded up on top of me , limbs , fingers , cheeks touching . I was unsure of what to say . " I did n't think  --  " I looked over his shoulder at the mess in the room . I kept staring at the draperies , unable to look at him . " Oh , I knew , " he said , turning my chin back with his forefingerto face him . " You knew what ? " " I knew you liked me . I felt it right down my spine . " " How ? " " Like a tickle , " he said , turning me over on my side so that we faced each other and he was still inside me . Then he ran his finger clown my spine . " Tickle , " he said again . My body floated out of control . " That 's not what I meant , " I said . " I did n't think I could feel like this . " He rubbed his fingers across my forehead as though he could feel what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my eyes warily . " You know , anybody else , I 'd figure they were bullshitting me , " he said . " But I believe you . " " You should . " " I do , " he said . " Did n't you know what was going on ? " " What do you mean ? " " Did n't you sense something beforehand ? " " No  --  well , I do n't know . " I did n't need to flatter him . It would be good to see how much of the truth he would tolerate from me and how far we could go on it.  |p140I  could look at his intense dark eyes as much as I wanted . After all , he was looking at me . I touched his mouth . I could touch him now . I felt awed . He kissed my fingers . I ran my palm down his side , stroking the long lines . In clothes , the strength of his torso was concealed . If I were a painter I 'd paint a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had just grown up . He kissed me hard on the mouth and pulled our bodies apart . He sighed and his lips brushed mine as he spoke . " I feel a little closer to life right now . I 'd never die if I could make love for-ever . " We both looked at the ceiling , until he touched my breasts lightly . " Now you feel the tickle ? " he asked . I nodded . " Remember this feeling , " he said sternly . " It happens when you make love to me . " " Right , " and then I got upset . It was idiotic to be lying here admiring his body . God only knew what he had done with it in the past . Maybe I 'd get a Pulitzer for research above and beyond . " Your breasts , " he said , " are so beautiful . They stay the same shape no matter what you do . " I was touched he noticed . Nobody else ever had but me . Then he disappeared . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bathroom . The tub was sunken , overflowing with pink bubbles . A window opened to palm trunks and dark sky . Steam smelling of jasmine bath salts blended with fresh air . " I 'll inhale until I float away , " I said . I stood on my toes and stretched my arms high , yawning . It was hard to stay upset when Mark was trying so hard to please me . He bowed low . Rituals and elegant details had kept his life going before . They would work for him again . " Hey , get in , " he said . " It 's hot . " I held his hand and dropped into the tub , sending a wave of pink bubbles onto the marble floor . I lay back and he soaped me with a huge sponge . He moved his other hand slowly over my skin . Afterward he dried me with an enormous towel as though Ip141was a child , and spread me out on the bed , kissed me , and opened a new box of bath powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumed clouds . He sprawled down on me , his mouth near my ear . " The night after it happened , a buddy of Sal 's came up the hill , saying , You should n't be alone . I 'll spend the night in your guest room . ' But I could n't sleep . I kept thinking , suppose it was him . He could 've murdered Sal . And at the funeral too . I 'd look around me and say to myself it could be anybody , anybody in this room . " An hour later , I woke up . I did n't know where I was until he began kissing my mouth in small brushes with his lips . I touched his face in the dark . I would take any excuse to touch him . " What 's going on ? " he asked . " I been through a lot today , " I said uncertainly . He began to talk through a yawn . " Lookit , we are safe up here in the clouds . This is the highest damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , and talking slow , with more of the South in his voice . " Why are we safe ? " I did n't point out that his home had been broken into twice . When I first planned this house , Sal kept on laughing at me for drawing blueprints , but I broke a path uphill , and shoveled out dead roots as thick as your leg . I cracked two axes . I put on a pair of big gloves and transplanted a hundred-year-old prickly pear . That cactus blooms every night . " " You sound like a pioneer , " I said . " It was back when we were all doing that number about working on the soil , " he said . " I moved in here , proud of my hacienda and my poor excuse of a path . Sal said I was Greta Garbo , wanting to be all alone up here . But I told him no , I was living in an aerie  --  that 's an eagle 's nest . " " I know , " I said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . In New York people talk facts and ideas . I read somewhere that Southernerstell stories . " But one spring the earth was damp and soft and Sal and me cut steps in the path and laid bricks between the rocks . We got blisters and sores on our palms.  | " But then , two nights later , Sal tripped about a hundred feet from my door , and fell six feet before he grabbed onto the trunk of an old date-palm tree . And a week later I heard this scream . It was the wrong key , and it kept going . " " Not Sal ? " I asked . " Nope . " " A burglar ? " " Worse , " Mark said . " I quick walked up and down that path for one whole hour . It was a poor skinny dog huddled under a rock . I figured she must 've fell down off the path some fifty feet . " " Did you get her ? " " No . I got cops up here . They said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had a house cat in her mouth . One cop raised his gun and shot her dead . " The whole thing made me sick to my stomach , and I took it as a warning . So I got some engineer to design me this modern cable car . It 's an elevator . " " And that path , it 's still there ? " " No . I tore the path away , and now nobody climbs up my cliff , and nobody climbs down . You can dive backward from my swimming pool three hundred feet and land on Wonderland Avenue , but that 's the only way down without the elevator . " We were both quiet for a while . My fear would n't go away . " What about people who break in ? " " Well , they did n't really break in . " " What ? " I was shocked . " There 's one weak point in the whole system , " he said . " Me . If I forget to lock the elevator , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide open . " I interrupted him . " How do you know we 're safe now ? " " Because I locked the elevator and the front door once I saw the mess , remember ? " " No . " " Too much going on ? " " Mark , could I just go out and make sure ? " " I 'll go right now . Just call it Southern comfort , " he said , and jumped out of bed . When he returned , I almost asked him to come back to the Chateau with me.  | " All safe , " and he leapt up on the bed , one foot on either side of me . " You look like a statue , " I said . " You can fuck a statue , but you ca n't have children , ' " he recited . " Is that your line ? " " Allen Ginsberg wrote that . Dylan 's always horsing around with his lyrics . It 'd be great to write songs like his poems . " He fell adroitly next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here , " he said . " I 'm playing make-believe . " " About what ? " " I 'm making believe that we 're living in the best of all possibleworlds . What a joke . Probably on me . " He pulled an edge of the sheet up over his body and his head . " It must be pretty up here , " I said , patting his arm under the sheet . " Tomorrow 1 'd like to look around . " I tugged a corner of the sheet away from his face . " What are you thinking about ? " " Living too dangerously , " he said slowly . " Like Sal Mineo ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know , " he said . His voice was tired . " I feel like a planet that was taking the same path around the same sun for a thousand years . Then last week somebody up and hit me hard from behind and now I 'm spinning all over the solar system . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolted . I did n't know what he was really saying about Sal and his old life . " Look , " he said . " I 'm lucky you 're here . But you 're strangest of all . " " I am ? " I was shameless , begging attention like that . I wanted to ask him if he 'd been with a woman before . The crazy part was how little it bothered me . " Yeah , but that ai n't all bad , " he joked . " I mean , you did n't do anything perverted , sick , or weird , did you , now ? " " That 's not the best way to describe it , " I said , " in negatives . " " I love your body , " he said quietly . " And ? " I asked tartly . He grabbed me and tickled me under my arms . I could n't stop laughing.  | " And , and , ' " he mimicked me . I extended my curved wrist . He lowered his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and we were pressing each other from head to feet , as though we were trying to occupy the same space with our bodies.  |p145At  dawn , I rolled over to Mark . But the bed was empty and I lay there feeling afraid . Pictures overlapped across my mind . Unnatural pictures . The orange paint on Mineo 's corpse at the funeral , the wild , dark woman banging my car in Watts , then Mark raging through his house . That last picture stuck . I scanned the bedroom . The curtains had been torn off the rods , and sunlight poured inside through gashes in the shades . Small bits of wool poked through a hole in the bare mattress . Today my fear had to do with Mark . If I felt close to him , the murderer was close to me . The condom was gone . Above me there were three red smears across the headboard . Since the streaks had n't turned brown , I knew the condom had n't contained blood  --  just red paint . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards for inventing illusions . But I shuddered involuntarily , grabbed a sweatshirt from the floor , and held its nubby softness against my bare body . Yawning , I opened the glass door to the balcony and squinted into the bright blue sky . I felt an odd elation . The deck was swept bare , except for one sinewy brown vine that had forced itself through the floorboards and crawled up the rough plaster walls of the house . Below me in the hills Ip146counted different shades of green leaves ; blue fir , chartreuse palms , and gray eucalyptus . The wood floor was hot . It drove me inside . Mark had left a note for me on the bathroom mirror . I read : Ladybug , By the time you open your gray eyes , I 'll be walking down the mountain . I got to think . I left blueberries on the kitchen table . Soak in the hot tub , and play , do n't worry . I locked the elevator . I 'll bang the car horn three times so you 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing makes sense today except you . XX MarkP.S . This note gives you permission to open drawers and closets . I smiled . He knew me already . I 'm addicted to other people 's secrets . I 'm a snoop . My editor says it comes with the profession . But I go overboard . In the kitchen , I scooped a handful of blueberries from a copper bowl . They spurted sweet between my teeth . The blue flowers of morning-glory vines stretched past the small window above the sink . Inside the wood breadbox , I found cartons of weird herbal teas . I opened the refrigerator . Unpasteurized milk , vitamin pills , and some brown liquid labeled SECRET SOUP STOCK were the sole contents . In the trash can , an ant crawled under empty vodka bottles and the remains of marijuana cigarettes . I managed to boil some water in a pan and make coffee . The kitchen floor was slate gray , and cool on my feet . At first , I did n't look down at my naked body . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on a solitary vacation , where no one knows me . I wondered if it was him or Los Angeles that made me feel like a perfect stranger . I walked outside on a white gravel lane past skinny bamboo trunks , bougainvillea , and swaying palm trees . Believe me , I do n't usually stroll around naked . Then I stepped on hot brown tile steps past huge Mexican pots overflowering with cactus and succulents . The steps curved around and down onto a largep147plateau carved out of the mountain . I walked under a wood arbor overrun with lilac blossoms . Under a willow tree , the hot tub was steaming . Made of redwoodplanks . Hot tub . A California joke-object . Instantly I picturedcartoon people splashing in it . Above the tub , the willow leaves blew . A white towel hung from one branch . I dipped my palm in the hot water . It was hot . Jets splashed deep inside the tub . As I lifted a bare leg to climb inside , a bird with a white wing shrieked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I lowered my body into the hot steaming water until I felt a soothing tingle of heat up to my shoulders . I sighed a few times . It was a shock of sensations . I was in a dream . The bird shrieked at me again . He did not know that I was immobilized by sensualityand torpor and would n't bother him . I shifted my hips in front of one jet and watched air bubbles form on my skin , while I felt water hurling itself against my back . I tried to remember a time when I had paused , alone , to see myself naked like this , outdoors , surrounded by birds and trees and flowers . To see my body in the sunlight was to see the work ethic die . It was a perfect day , buoyant as a butterfly . Despite the steam rising from the tub , I did not sweat . The dry winds took care of that . I broke a eucalyptus leaf and smelled the fresh camphor of the resin . I closed my eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car below on the road . It stopped , and I waited to hear horn blasts that would announce Mark 's return . Instead , a door slammed . The outdoor elevator whirred , its gate clicked , and the motor growled as it started to climb up the hill . Somethingwas wrong . He 'd forgotten to lock it again . I began to panic . I realized I was caught here , unarmed white flesh in a shallow pit of bubbling water . My face was sweating now from fear . I was in danger . With a thump , the elevator motor stalled , and started again . It rode up the hill , closer and closer . I would bluff . I would be cool , extremely nearsighted , and a little jerky . When the gate slammed at the top of the hill , I called out , " Hey , I 'm out back . "  |p148Nobody  answered . I heard the front door slam . They were inside the house . I kept quiet . Then I heard the back door slam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intruder on the cement steps , under the lilac arbor , and walking across the lawn to the hot tub . " Yeah , in the back , " I gurgled , dumping my head in the water , covering my face with wet hair . " Oh , hey , listen , " I said . " You better give me a hand . I ca n't find my glasses . Took ' em off to clean the pool . Then my big feet kicked ' em around someplace . Whew , that 's dumb , hey ? I ca n't see good enough to find them . They got red frames . " Still , the place was silent . But somebody was listening . Somebodydangerous was judging my performance . " I swear I used your wet mop , your Hoover vacuum cleaner , and your garbage disposal , " I said . " I only been in this tub for five minutes . The agency said I 'd clean your house in five hours and I will or you can keep the twenty-five dollars . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep on . I was trying to sound like IQ zero . But the words would n't come out of my mouth . Instead , my throat closed up . I had played all my cards too fast . I surprised myself . I started to cry . Then a figure stepped out to one side , pulling off huge sunglasses . Like me , he was posing . He closed his eyes against the sun and the sight of me . He was the essence of disdain . I was so surprised that I forgot I was naked . I stood up in the hot tub , and then , with a rush of shame , I crouched down again . Water flooded over the edge . I bent my knees to get my breasts under the water level . He laughed at my clumsy efforts at modesty . It was Chris Franklin , Sal Mineo 's English lover . It seemed like a hundred years ago that I 'd seen him at the funeral . " Did n't know Mark had hired a blind maid , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a voice that told you it was hot stuff . I was furious . He looked better than he had at the funeral . Physically , he was a knockout . His silver-blond hair was disheveledand his green undershirt torn . Somehow his blue eyes and sullen mouth looked very James Dean . " Just how did you get up here ? " I said . " Me ? "  | " I thought the elevator was locked . " " I , love , am a proper guest . " He held up a key . " Well , you 're new to me , " I said , trying to match his disdain . " Well , if you last , love , at whatever your duties , then maybe the master of the house will give you a key as well . " I was tired of crouching . My face must have looked numb . He spoke without smiling . " I 'll turn my back , and you can step out . I do n't fancy watching you . " I reached up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I heard the sound of Mark 's horn from below . Chris caught my eye and held it . He was adroit at creating drama . Too adroit . We stared at each other the whole time the elevator motor labored down and up the hill . Still staring , he walked past me toward the turquoise pool , reached down , and turned a round handle in a patch of English ivy . 1fusic poured from the earth , rising from behind him . It was an old black man singing " I Got A Woman , " an early Elvis Presley song . But hearing this guy made me realize Elvis sang it too fast . This old man was singing Memphis blues in a sly voice , tired and easy . Chris 's eyes stayed on me , saying this was his territory and he knew every trick . When Mark loped into the garden , he whistled at the sight of us . I noticed the two of them were dressed alike . They wore faded T-shirts tucked into old jeans , and silver cowboy buckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , high and boyish . Mark nodded to the music . He walked over to the ivy and turned the handle . The sound went way down , and , with his back to me , he faced down past the pool to the city and began scat-singing . His voice leapt above and below the old black man 's . When the old man began to sing against the melody , Mark did the tune . It was lovely and natural , like a choirboy singing a solo hymn . Then the music stopped . I said , " Did n't you say nobody else could get up here ? " " Sorry , " Mark said . " I forget he 's got a key . " " How quickly you forget , " Chris said . " She 's a girl , darling . What 's going on ? "  |p150I  felt exposed , and a thrill of fear went through me . Mark said , " Why do n't the gents retire for some cigars while the lady steps out of her bath ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . They turned toward the house , ignoring me completely . I started to lift myself out of the hot tub . I was listening intently . Chris whispered something . " I do n't reckon I know anybody by that name , " Mark said . " Oh , he 's seen you on the bar scene , " Chris said . Mark laughed . " A lot of folks on the bar scene . Maybe I know them . Maybe I do n't . " Chris tried once more . " Jonathan Simpson 's his full name and he knew Sal . " Mark said , " A whole mess of weird folks are going to start sayingthey knew Sal . " I wanted to see what Mark 's face looked like when he was lying . Chris laughed sourly . " The police seem to fancy the whole lot of us as suspects . " They were standing ten feet or so from me in a bamboo grove . " But they have n't mentioned a lie detector test and your alibi ? " Chris asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . I 'll tell him about you too . " " Actually , they tried to book me last night . " " They got laws against mourning in peace ? " Mark said . " Bloody hell , " Chris said . The next few minutes passed slowly . I got out of the tub , wrappingthe towel around myself . My knees were shaking under the weight of my body . " Her name 's Sara , " Mark said abruptly . " You two meet ? " Chris shot a glance at Mark and then knelt down to tie one ofhis sneakers . " It 's pushing it , is n't it , to force me to chat it up inyour garden with a naked member of the distaff side ? " I tried to think of something cutting , but the fight was between them . Mark said , " I 'm going to ask you to say howdy to her one more time , and that 's it . " Chris folded his arms against his chest . " Good show . " Mark did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would Sal say ? " His voice was mocking . " I mean , his favorite prince in all the world , Mark Loren ? " " Sal loved both of us , " Mark said quietly , not moving . " We know Sal loved what he could n't have . " " It was n't like that . " Chris 's voice was full of anger . " It 's easy for you to sit back while everybody admires you , and you can tell yourself you 're not hustling your sweet ass . ' Oh , Mark 's just in it for the refinementand the fucking beauty . ' " He raised a fist , as though he wanted to punch Mark 's face . Mark turned toward him , pouting . He seemed almost flatteredby the outburst . That made me angry . " Do n't try to make everythingugly , " he said . " I make my own moves on my own time . " " Mark , " I called out , " is this part of the package ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chris . " What you were saying about pleasure and loving beauty , " I said . " What do you think ? " he said , looking meaningfully at Chris . " I think it 's a catfight , " I said . Chris snapped . " Oh , oh , I see now . You 're throwing your lot in with that . " He nodded his head at me . His voice was at a fevered pitch . " I 'm sure the guys at the bar are going to be heartbroken to hear you 're retiring your princely ass . No more admiring looks for Prince Mark , no more hustling . Just the little woman . " Mark said slowly , " Do n't take it out on me . " " That 's not what we 're talking about . " Chris 's mouth made a smirk . I wondered why Mark did n't throw Chris out , or at least mentionthe possibility of punching him in the mouth . But he did n't . " He 's dead , " Mark said abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It stinks , " Chris said . Mark took a step over to Chris and put an arm around him . " I hear you , " Mark said . " Remember that hymn about the whisperingof the trees ? " He waved one hand disparagingly around him . " That hymn about how nature proves God is love and all ? Well , today it do n't and He is n't and that 's a fact . " " Today you 're sour on religion ? " Chris asked  | " They say death is the reason for religion , " Mark said . " It 's always things you ca n't control that kill you . " " Mark , I must see you alone , " Chris interrupted . " Do n't make me beg . " " Mark , can I say something ? " I said . " Sara , I 'll be right back . " Chris and Mark strolled away in step , their eyes down , their elbows stiff against their sides . They disappeared up the flagstonepath without saying another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was pink . My body 'd been cooking too long . I was pretty like a baby after a bath , soft and weak . And I was angry . I 'd stumbled into somebody 's life and I was on dangerous ground . Then Mark came running down the lawn . At least their private moment had been brief . He was in a different mood . He pulled his shirt over his head . " Last one in the pool buys me a hot meal , a drink , and another pool , " he yelled . In the daylight , his skin was taut , poreless . I saw that he was brown except for pale shadows under his eyes , between his fingers , and in his armpits . His nipples were the same brown color . I forced myself to stop looking at him . " I 'm leaving , " I said . " Got work to do . " " You were in that tub too long , " he said . " Let 's swim . " " But what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " Sara , I 'm sorry you heard that . My friend is bereft . I 'm apologizing for him and for me . " " What about hustling at that bar ? " I repeated . " It 's not like that . They like me . " He shrugged . " What about me ? " " You treat me good , and "  --  he hesitated  --  " I like you . " A look of surprise flashed across his face . " I do n't feel like swimming , " I said . He knelt and turned the music on again . " You need to get the blood moving , and then , I promise , you 'll feel better . You 'll love it . " From somewhere in the ground , his voice came up , pure and melodious . I recognized a hint of the blues the old man had been singing . He learned well . " I do n't feel like playing . " " Life is short , " he said . " Trust me . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungarees , thrust hisp153arms high above his head , and sang out , " Lord , keep me from sinking like a stone . " He grinned for my benefit , jumped high up in the air , arched his body down , touched his feet , and disappearedunderwater . I had never seen anybody do anything so graceful . I dangled a foot in the pool while I watched him glide past me underwater . He looked like a marine creature with the water rippling off his bare body . He surfaced near me , snorting . " Hurry , hurry , " he shouted over the music . " Jump . " He put a cold hand on my ankle . Ordinarily I take my time . I wade into lakes and pools . I kicked at the cold water , held my breath , and jumped feet first . The underwater speakers shocked me . My body seemed to absorbthe vibrations of his guitar and his voice through my pores . Waves of sound bounced off the tile walls and floor of the pool , like in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing in the air . I felt high . The music was all around me , and inside me , and making me stretch and swim clean and hard . I let myself be carriedalong by it . There was no real purpose , no product to all of this , except that it was fun . The water kept surprising me , tinglingmy breasts , my thighs , and all the parts of my body that are usually covered by a bathing suit . Whenever my face broke the surface , I felt the heat of the sun , and the fresh winds , and the smell of the camellias , and then I was back inside the cool , dappled darkness being touched all over by the wet and the movement of the water and the music . We were two naked bodies , gliding past each other , sometimes flesh showing at the surface , splashing , shouting , playing , singing lines of his songs , turning on our faces , turning on our backs , to the sound of his tunes . There is a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a discotheque into split-second pictures in graceful poses . The two of us had the grace of dancers . I felt beautiful . At the shallow end , he grabbed my hand above the turquoise water and then I waved goodbye and kicked down and swam along the bottom of the pool to the other side . When the record ended , we both climbed out of the pool . We flopped down on dark green ivy , sunning ourselves . " I was lying before , " he said.  | " When ? " " Before , when Chris was here . I love flowers and trees , and I want to believe nature and life have an order , " he said . " Pantheism ? " I asked , spellbound . " I do n't call it anything special . " A few minutes later , I stood up and rubbed myself with the towel . It was as much out of habit as anything ; I was already dry . Mark surprised me by throwing himself into the towel and my arms , so that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the towel together . We untangled , and several minutespassed while we sunned ourselves , and then I said , " I do n't understand Chris . " " What do you mean ? " I did n't know where to begin , . " Does he work ? " " He 's an actor , classical training at Cambridge . Sal flipped when he saw him do Hamlet in London . He 's done Broadway , arty stuff with Joe Papp , porn flicks ; he was the voice of a zebra on a Beech Nut commercial . " " Is he good ? " " Depends on his mood , " Mark said . He lay back supporting himself on his elbows and squinted against the sun . " But you mean acting , right ? " He snorted . " Sal loved his work . Of course Sal would 've bought him the Queen Mary to keep him happy . " I wondered how dangerous it was to make Chris unhappy . " What work are you planning to do today ? " he asked suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you think she saw Sal Mineo ? " " We do n't know if they ever had that meeting , " he said . " No . " Then he said , " But you 'll figure it out , wo n't you , baby ? " There was a cold tone to his voice . It sounded as if he was n't sure he wanted this stuff figured out . " Why do you think he wanted to see her ? " I asked . " Sal was worried about this rock movie that she wants to get me for . " " You ? " " She wants me to play the lead and write the score , " he said . " What 's your part ? "  | " Some burned-out musician who gets tired of life on the road and hires a double to do his act , then the double gets knifed in front of a live audience . Sal did n't like the plot . He was afraid it might make me a live target . " " But he never told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Well , maybe that explains her message on the service . " " What 's she like ? " " Only thing I know is she 's rich , " he said . " Oh , people talk about the star system , but money makes movies . " " Why did you lie to Chris about Jonathan ? " I asked . Instead of answering , he said , " Do n't tell anybody you saw Chris here today . " " Why not ? " He pulled the towel over his body . " Tough-girl reporter . " " That 's why I 'm here . I 'm not some mermaid , " I said . " I ai n't either , but I do n't owe you . I 'm not proud of everything I learned out here . But just because somebody 's smart enough to hit you with good questions do n't mean you owe them the answers . That 's what Sal always said . " He picked his head up and watched my face falling apart . Then he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I stood up , naked , and grabbed for the towel . " I have work to do . " I had to control myself . People often refuse to answer reporters ' questions . I should n't whine and run away . He stood up , pulled my towel over my shoulders , and smoothed it there . " Coffee and homemade orange juice ? " he asked , bumpinghis nose on mine . " Do n't go away unless you have to , and do n't do it mad . "  |p156Sunset  Boulevard is a canyon road . In another era , water must have spilled here from the hills and made a river flowing into the sunset and the ocean . Sitting at a red light , I noticed other cars flashing their turn signals . I looked up . I had arrived at the sea . The sun was shrouded by a cloud . The ocean was gray , with waves that crested like icing near the shoreline . A green sign read " Pacific Ocean , " as if there could be any mistaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic . Driving toward Malibu made me lightheaded . The winds whipped sand across the highway , beige snakes wiggling over the black road . Somebody  --  Sal Mineo -- said there 's no smog down here . I was driving between a wild desert area on my right and a row of beach houses facing the ocean with their backs to me on my left . I was high . It was new , and I 'd gotten here on my own steam . I slowed down to see the addresses on silver mailboxes that looked straight out of suburbia . But soon they were hidden behind fences , wild grasses , and flowering hedges . The houses became bigger , farther from one another , and drenched by growingthings . I passed LYONS painted on a white fence swarming with sunflowervines . I braked on the shoulder.  |p157I  turned the Dodge toward the lane , while other cars whizzed by . The beach house was set back from a road . A field of yellow mustard flowers bordered by a green hedge ran down to the house . Black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I parked behind a silver Rolls Royce in front of the long , low redwood house , nestled in gardens of yellow tulips , pink daisies , and orange poppies . Somebody here had a green thumb . The building took possession of the coast like a motel on a tropicalisland , reflecting a bright and gray light from the sea . I had to get inside this house . It was the last place Sal Mineo was seen alive , and I wanted to ask Kate Lyons about the messageshe 'd left him . These people 's lives might be tangled in ways that could take years to understand . The wind whipped my hair while I climbed the polished black marble steps . A black maid opened the door . She was wearing a black chiffon dress under a white apron , and she was almost six feet tall . With her round face , breasts , and hips , she resembled a Gauguin painting . A gardenia bloomed in her black hair . " Yes ? " Her voice was soft , modulated . " I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in . Mrs. Lyons wants to see your press card . " This rarely happens on routine assignments . It 's not a friendly sign . I flipped open my wallet and handed her the card . The entire front wall of the living room had been torn out and replaced with glass . I walked over and stared at an endless horizon and sky . The room was filled with pink and white furniture . In fact , it looked like a boudoir , down to the huge pink daisies from her garden that filled the antique silver vases . It occurred. to me that it had been created to appear in a magazine . The maid raised her long fingers and indicated a white wicker loveseat , with dainty white linen pillows . I sat down on the edge of the sofa , and she left for a moment . She returned carrying a tray of Georgian sterling tea service . I was sure the teapot , sugar , and creamer were polished daily . On a small silver dish were four hot chocolate-chip cookies . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending one knee and holding the tray while I poured some tea and ate a cookie . I sat on the edge of the wicker sofa , sipping the tea  |p158When  she left , I popped another cookie into my mouth . I touched the old pink and white American quilt on the wall . I picked up a photograph of a baby in a heavy silver frame . The room was too ordered . It was hard to imagine the fertile chaos of a baby . It made me uncomfortable . I do n't think I was reacting to the money , but nobody 's perfect . I dropped the silver frame when the maid announced , " Mrs. Lyons will see you after her daughter 's swimming lesson . " I sat down again on the tiny sofa and watched the room change color when the clouds moved away from the sun . The light bounced off the water into this pink and white space . Somebody slid open the glass doors facing the beach and came in . She was about five feet tall . " Welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small hand and my press card . Her voice was nasal and fiat , and she was wearing a floorlengthwhite velvet bathrobe , open to show a skinny body under a skimpy black bikini . The bathing suit was more gold chains than fabric . There were lines around her mouth . She was dieting too hard to keep her body thin ; it made her face look drawn and old . She gave the last chocolate-chip cookie a furtive look as she gripped my hand . " Your series on women and porn was something , " she said . She talked like a New Yorker , fast . I dropped her hand , pleased that she recognized my name . She must have read my stuff in the Post about real-estate owners and feminists banding together to get rid of porn theaters . " Beautiful poppy garden , " I said , returning the compliment . " I love tending flowers , " she said . " I only have two men helpingme out . " A blond-haired child about two years old followed her , clutching a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small white wicker rocking chair , and tucked her bare feet under herself . The child climbed up into her lap and closed her eyes . Kate smoothed the baby 's hair and rocked her as we talked . " Your first trip out here ? " she asked . " Yes . " " You have big eyes like a tourist , " she said . Her eyes were blank . " Your daughter is great , " I said.  | " Nothing pleases me so much , " she said , and her voice broke . " I love her so . " I listened with one ear , waiting to work the conversation around to Sal Mineo . Her mouth was stretched into a smile , but her eyes gave nothing away . She was saying , " Motherhood is the answer to life . Look , we 've all lost our way . We do n't want to grow up . What 's the answer , a big house ? A husband forever ? Money ? Fame ? Freedom ? Each answer is a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picket lines at Columbia . But things are still happening in California . There 's hope out here . " I did n't agree with her . " How are you Californians different ? " " We have n't given up . We did n't roll over and accept mediocre lives in Ourtown , U.S.A. We want more . We went west . Out here we 're still looking . We make the fads , the trends that sweep the country . For me , the answer is motherhood . I belong to a group called MOM . Dedicated to getting women into the maternity scene . " Sometimes disagreement works in interviews . " You have tans , motherhood , self-help , and exercise groups . What 's new about that ? " She pressed a brass button on the floor with her bare toe . The black maid appeared and took the sleeping baby from her lap . " How long you going to be out here ? We can talk later . I got a screening now . " So today 's interview was over . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A week or so , " I said , watching her open a huge address book covered in white leather . Her name was written in gold on the front . " Where you staying ? " " The Chateau . When can we talk again ? " " I 'm having a party tomorrow night , " she said , writing my name with a gold pencil . " You come . You 'll look . You 're wrong . It 's a different place . The problems we got out here are typical for paradise . It 's different . It 's about after dreams come true . " Instead of asking her about dreams that come true , I hit my forehead with my palm . " You 're , you 're ... "  | " Yes ? " She preened , running her fingers through her short damp hair like a bird , feather by feather . " I know you from before . " It was all that sex last night . I 'd probably lost six IQ points . I was dazed . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I noted that she had very small teeth . " You 're from New York , " I said , sitting forward . She ran her fingers through her hair again , and I saw that her nails were bitten down . She stretched , and yawned slightly . " Honey , it should n't have taken you so long . I did n't get where I am today by forgetting  --  how can I put it  --  people like me . " I blinked . " Women 's Wear Daily , " I said , sitting back . " Six fucking years , " she said , and twisted her mouth like she had just tasted soap . " I made more money taking one pissing meeting yesterday than I made breaking ass for six years at Women 's Wear . " Then I remembered her . Under the byline K. R. Lyons , this woman 'd made incredible controversy as an entertainment reporter . She covered domestic lingerie and show business for Women 's Wear , the trade newspaper for the clothing business . For years she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented the term " BP , " beautiful people , for celebrities . Everybody in the news business said that back in the first hectic days of New York magazine , Clay Felker got some of his best feature ideas from her Women 's Wear pieces . It was also said that she made Jackie Kennedy Onassis into legend . For years Lyons paid salesgirls to call in Mrs. Kennedy 's purchases and boutique haunts . Since the former first lady was the country 's primary clothing consumer , the newspaper of the retail and wholesale garment business made mythology of her buying habits . I had only seen K. R. Lyons once , at an ERA fund-raising party . I never forgot her moves . At any point , she was always in animatedconversation with one of the most famous people in that room , smiling , and looking as though she was honoring them with her attention . After years of watching her small dark head bobbing next to the celebrity of the hour , people stopped calling her a cheap hustler . She became a beacon . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hot actor . So it seemed perfect to find her in Hollywood where stakes are bigger.  | " What 's the most interesting thing you remember about me ! " She almost batted her eyelashes . What I remembered was how she broke one of the major rules of journalism . " It was that story you wrote about the governor , " I said . One night at Elaine 's restaurant , a distinguished governor told her how he 'd been seduced by a fading Hollywood star . She put down her pencil when he told her she could n't use the story . It was " off the record . " " Off the record ' is a big deal in daily journalism , " I said . She smiled without pleasure . " A stupid gentleman 's agree-ment . " I did n't agree . I telephone and telephone people to confirm facts I get off the record without mentioning anything I 'm told by my original source . I 'll never forget Women 's Wear 's banner headlines over her story about the governor 's dalliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyons 's piece was accompanied by a photograph of the governor whispering in her ear at Elaine 's . She was smiling directly at the camera . She was reviled and did n't mind admitting that she never told her editor about her promises to keep things off the record . She was written up in the New York Times and quoted on her love of expensivejewels , famous people , and the right of journalists to print anything . " It was my farewell move , " she said . " I decided that off the record ' impeded the process of getting news to the public . Do you agree ? " " Well , the best stuff is often what people do n't want other people to know about them , but  --  " She interrupted me . " A do-good lawyer from the ACLU defendedme and talked up the First Amendment . " I remembered hearing how she 'd stood on a chair at Elaine 's to read aloud the Columbia Journalism Review article praising her courageous stand in favor of the First Amendment . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't bet against me . " I never heard any woman talk with this kind of swagger . " Are you still indestructible ? " " Do n't you ever read the trades ? " she snapped . She beganp162nibbling at one fingernail . It was either nerves or plain hunger . " I made a hundred million before I hit thirty . " " But money does n't buy indestructibility . " " I have n't come across anything better , " she said . I was about to open my mouth and remind her about the power of motherhood . She cuddled a pink telephone on her shoulder , dialed , and made urgent sounds of dissent . " Absolutely not , " she repeated . A man dressed in bathing trunks and a T-shirt entered between sliding glass doors . He sat down on the white rug at her feet , widened his hazel eyes , and stared at me with the assurance of someone who was convinced that he was wonderful to behold . I had a hunch his character 'd been ruined because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a strong jawline . His fine hair was bleached in front by the sun . His hair , eyebrows , and eyes were the same gold color . The effect was heightened by a small stubble of beard . After a moment , he threw back his head and laughed soundlessly . Probably at my discomfort . Then he turned away to stare intensely out the glass doors . He 'd been practicing on me . Nothingpersonal . I tried to make sense of the phone conversation . She saw me looking at her and said , " I 'm taking this in the master bedroom . " He waved one hand languidly at me . " I 'm not her husband . " Boy , conversations did n't exactly flow drawing-room style out here . She held her bathrobe up like a train and ran out of the living room . He sat in her chair , staring at me again . He did n't replace the telephone receiver . We both heard the babble of angry voices coming from the instrument . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold head toward the telephone . " You 're the girl reporter from New York . " " How do you know ? " " I was looking through your clippings all morning , " he said . " Where ? " " At the morgue , the L.A. Times morgue . " I was annoyed that Kate Lyons had flattered me so easily . " You ever do television commercials ? " I asked . " Aftershave lotion , " he said . " Guess which one . " Any of them , " I said . He stiffened . " Watch it , darling . " " Well , what are you so angry about ? " I was trying to imitatep163his tone of idle curiosity . I failed . I 'm the earnest type . " Nothing , babe . I got my place in the sun . " He pointed his thumb back at the door Kate had exited through . " She 's producingthis idea of mine . An original screenplay . " " Oh , really ? " He sure did n't look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds familiar , " I said . " What 's it about ? " " This big rock star . He sits in the audience and sings along with his double . " A version of the script Mark had told me about . " Great . " I did n't feel bad about lying . I was about to ask him about Mark when Kate came back into the living room . Her eyes narrowed . " Up , " she said to him , and they both laughed like it was a joke . He stood quickly at her side , almost at attention . Then she sat and tucked her feet under herselfagain , whispering behind her hand , " It scares me how much he loves me . " I would n't have been surprised if the next sentence had been delivered in baby talk . " Tell her , tell her how we met and how much you love me . " She hit him playfully in the leg . " I love her a lot , " he said . He was looking out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a truck one day to clean the junk out of the swimming pool , and I stayed for  --  well , dinner . " " A pool cleaner . " Kate laughed . " Everybody out here is really somebody else . " She stopped smiling . " Can I help you with anything else ? " " Well , about Sal Mineo  --  " She interrupted . " He was somebody else too . He was a kid star who disappeared from the screen . He was dead in this town for fifteen years before some local faggot took a knife to him . He could n't act . He was nowhere . Who cares about those kinky faggot plays ? He was a big nothing . He owed money in this town . " " He was a star , " I said . " He was a joke , " she snapped . " Did n't you hear the old Nichols and May record where somebody says Sal Mineo will play Ernest Hemingway in a play about Gertrude Stein ? And that was the fifties , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't know him that well ? " " Who 'd want to know him ? "  |p164I  stared her in the face . " Well , there was a message from you on his answering service . " Her boyfriend , whose name she had n't told me , laughed . " She 's not that hard up . " " Shut up , " she said . " What about the message ? " I asked again . " What 'd it say ? " I could n't tell if she was stalling . " It said something about meeting at the beach and not at Burbank , and doing it after lunch . " Kate sighed . " Darling , I was calling Mark Loren to break the bad news . They must have shuffled my message into the wrong box . No wonder Mark never got back to me . In this town peoplereturn my calls fast . " " What bad news ? " I asked . " Oh , Sal had some lame idea that Mark would be good for a movie I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend said . " Remember me ? " " As long as I do remember you , we 're developing , " she said . " Do you know Mark ? " I asked . " Barely , " she said . " He gets me hot . " I shot a glance at her boyfriend . He yawned . " But he wo n't translate to the screen . Except for Presley , singers do n't . Remember that bomb , Two-Lane Blacktop ? James Taylor looked like a zombie . It was a mystery how he made little girls cry for him . " " Well , who 're you using ? " I asked . " Not Mark Loren , " she said . " He 's a good musician , " I said . " There 's something wrong with him , " she said . I flinched . " Anybody who 'd pal around with Sal Mineo has lost it . " She had brought up Sal Mineo voluntarily . So far , he hadn'tbeen her favorite topic of conversation . " He 's got no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was rubbing the fingertips of her left hand with her thumb in the peasant gesture for money . " Success  --  for success . " " You 're tough , " I said . " I 'm a businesswoman. "  | " Well , who will you use ? " " Mick Jagger , " she said . " He needs a commercial movie . Those arty things get him nowhere . He 's going to be a family man in my film . " " You 're the producer ? " " Yes . " She sounded impatient . I 've got some of the fan in me . " What 's he really like ? " I asked . She turned her wrist around and stared at it as if she were wearing a watch . " I got work to do . " " Does n't Nicholas Ray live around here ? " " He directed Sal too long ago , " Lyons said absently . " But I want to hear about Sal Mineo and James Dean . That 's the only movie they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old news , " she said . " Where does he live ? " I asked again . " Way down the beach . " She pointed a thumb over her shoulder . " Could you show me his house ? " " You run into Chris Franklin ? " she asked as we walked toward the glass wall and the ocean . " No . " I 'd promised Mark not to say anything . We walked out onto a white wood balcony . The sun was so bright I saw red whirls when I blinked . I followed her down about fifty marble steps to the sand . Her bathrobe dragged the black steps . " You ever meet Chris ? " she asked over her shoulder . " Yes . " " Where ? " " At the funeral . " " How was his mood ? " I stopped ten steps above the sand . The beach below me was deserted except for three white gulls walking on long legs . " Do you know Chris ? " " Too well , " she said shortly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business . " " What business ? "  | " Mine , " she snapped . I almost sighed . We were down at the sand . Two steps , and my shoes filled up with it . The wind smelled like seaweed . Exceptfor her , it was a calm setting . I looked her in the face . " When did you hear about the murder ? " " Do n't remember . " " Were you here at the party when it happened ? " She twisted her mouth . " No , darling , I was creeping down behind Sal 's house holding a dagger in my hand like Lady Macbeth . " Instead of saying goodbye , she spread her bathrobe open and put her hands on her bare hips . " The woman 's thing , it 's just an excuse for girls diddling girls , right ? " " No . " I have n't argued about that stuff for years , but she was exasperating . " Yes , it 's just a way for girls to do it to girls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings , moral theories . " I stifled myself . She added , " And , darling , I 'd bone up on my Hollywood if I were you . Read Hollywood Babylon or Variety or something . You 're all wrong for this story . Too uptight , too prudish . " " I 'll get the story . " My voice sounded cold , almost bored . She said hurriedly , " No hard feelings , " and squinted toward the horizon . In the sunlight I saw more lines between her eyebrows and around her mouth . " Just joking around , darling , " she said , looking up and down the beach . " I 'll see you tomorrow night , " I said . Her head shot up , and she stared at me blankly . The party . " She tried to smile . It was partly the lack of flesh on her face , but her mouth looked mean . " Your friend inside , he 's a writer ? " " He 's Hollywood born and bred . " She laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's fighting his way to the top through me . I mean , the motto here is Always fuck up . ' You always fuck somebody who 's more successful than you . " " How can both people fuck up ? "  | " Do n't be so analytic , " she said . " Some people do it out of lust or affection . You know that already , I assume . " I nodded like an idiot . " The ambitious one has to offer something . " " What does he offer you ? " " Guess , " she said shortly . We were both watching a naked little girl run down the beach to the water 's edge . She was plump and dimpled , a great spot of pink flesh against the sand . Kate turned from the child to look at me . " I do n't mind you as much as I thought . " " Thanks . " " No , I mean it . You got that New York thing . Out here they come bold , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . " " You noticed it ? " she asked . " You would . " In fact , she was the only woman besides Annie Harmon I 'd met out here . She added , " I like you because I do n't scare you  --  yet . " And then she twisted her mouth . The little girl screamed and we both turned . She was running at the waves on chubby little legs until they started to flow toward her , then jumping away . I tore my eyes reluctantly from the child . Kate Lyons was looking the other way down the beach at some houses bunched together . " That 's the colony . Nick Ray 's staying at a white house . Next to Paul Newman 's . It 's about fifteen houses down , and it 's got Italian designer furniture out front . " I stuck my hand out to the woman . " I 'll see you tomorrow night . " She looked confused . For such a smart cookie , there was somethingfunny about the way she kept forgetting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interview with a compliment . " You got one thing , " she began . " That 's interesting , Kate , " I said in my new cold voice . " What is it ? " " Innocence  --  it could go over on limited engagement . " " What do you mean ? "  | " We 've popped every pill , fucked the wrong people at the wrong times . We 've done it all . We ca n't go back . " She climbed the stairs to her huge house , and I set out for Nick Ray 's bungalow . The heels of my loafers kept sinking into the sand . I stuffed them into my pocketbook . I gazed out over the ocean to the horizon . The sea was dense and silver like wrinkled tinfoil . It was too bright to look at for long . I pulled some damp seaweed off the bottom of my foot . I 've always liked what Homer called the sea  --  " the many-voiced roaring . " I closed my eyes to hear the surf building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides . My mind went back to Sal Mineo . I suddenly remembered something that happened as a kid . I 'd been practicing piano when I heard loud cheering up the street . I ran down to the sidewalk and saw a whole parade of girls carrying a sheet with writing on it : WELCOME HOME SAL MINEO . It was his local fan club , and Sal Mineo was somewhere in that crowd , but I could n't find him . I felt left out . Walking along the ocean started me thinking about the last frontier . This was it . Maybe movies were the last American fantasy . Sal Mineo must 've had a dream about movies . A fantasy that the screen could make him more than himself , more than human . I wondered if the movie screen was the biggest mirror we 'd produced for personal vanity . It was the biggest reflecting pool in the world . Under the shadow of my hand I stared at the sea again . It looked as hard and silvery as a mirror . Small waves washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look for the little girl . But she 'd vanished . The tide had smoothed away my footprints . I remembered that Sal Mineo once lived here in Malibu near the Lyonses , and now he 'd vanished without a trace.  |p169Sun  beat down on the cars in the parking lot of Schwab 's Drugstore on Sunset . This was a big afternoon hangout , but I was n't going to play tourist . I needed a phone to find Nick Ray , and I had to buy some batteries for my miniature tape recorder . Normally I rely on memory and a few notes , but I was starting to feel wary . I looked at a huge cactus in the flower shop next door and shook sand out of my shoes . I bumped the hot hood of a car with . my elbow . At least I was n't still back at the beach looking for Nick Ray . I 'd swallowed my terror and trudged up from the waterline to a white bungalow with Italian furniture . When nobody answered Nick Ray 's door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I found a message he 'd left near the telephone from his office at Burbank Studio . Half of Schwab 's was as empty as a small-town drugstore , filled with sleepy pharmacists and analgesics . The other half was packed with women and men in sunglasses smelling of suntan oil . They were all reading Daily Variety . I walked past two schoolkids licking ice cream cones and thought about the murder . Sal Mineo 's world was beginning to take shape for me . I wanted to hunt out Jonathan , that bitter kid from the gay bar who did n't have an alibi . He must hate the idea that Chris came out here to join Sal . I had a million ques/tions for Chris Franklin . I could use my tape recorder to scare him . It 'd be my bodyguard . I 'd have physical proof if he threatenedme . Also , I wanted my editor to hear some of these flaky and sadisticconversations . Kate Lyons told a quick story about her messageon Sal Mineo 's answering service . But she claimed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the way he told it . I 'd bet that she was lying , but I did n't want to say it in print without her voice on tape . I 'd promised Mark to work on solving the murder . From now on , the tiny Sony recorder would be hidden in my shoulder bag . Schwab 's dining area had a bland smell like warm cardboard . I squeezed onto a stool at the counter next to a woman with tawny skin . She was the color of honey , with sun-dipped hair that resembled Kate Lyons 's boyfriend 's . I felt around in my pocketbook for my purse . The guy on my other side dropped his grilled sandwich back on the plate and shook his fingers . " Too hot . " I asked him about it . " Tuna melt with cheese , " he said . " The same , " I told the counterman , my fingers feeling the edge of a folded paper . I peered into my bag . It was the page Mark 'd torn from Sal Mineo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detective . I 'd forgotten it . The handwriting was uneven and slanted in several directions . Sal Mineo 'd written it in pencil . Some of it was illegible , but I started to make it out . It was a message to himself : " I must .. . Christopher , and he has to get it . There are many different ways of . . . We 're . . . each other . I must be kind . . . life friends . " I folded and unfolded the page . I wished he could tell me more . I was eating too fast . My tuna melt tasted great . It had a middle-American gourmet quality . Somebody like me decides to get brave , and what do I do ? I order a new kind of tuna sandwich . The note kept going through my mind . " ... I must be kind . " I had a hunch that Sal was trying to break up with Chris . After testing the tape recorder batteries , I paid cash for them . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an out-of-state check . But my money supply was running out . I went to the pay phones in the back and dialed Chris Franklin.  |p171He  answered the phone after six rings . I licked the tiny rubber suction cup of my phone tape and smacked it onto the receiver . He sounded rushed and very important . " Darling , you see it 's not just me . " He intoned like he was speaking in iambic pentameter . " I mean , really , dear , it 's family . When the time comes , and the best  --  and I mean the best  --  writer approaches me , I 'll tell my story . The only bloody story . I am the only one in the world who knows what he went through . Where were you when Sal was opening his play last year ? " If all an actor needed was a silent audience , this man was a hit . " I must ask you something , " I insisted . " There 's this note in his copy of Fortune and Men 's Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . What was that all about ? " " I must ring off , " he said . " Did it make you mad ? " " Sal never made me angry . " " Well , I heard he had a date with somebody else the last night of his life . " I hated myself . This was dirty pool . " Darling , I have n't time for your vulgar chit-chat . " " I 'm going to write my article no matter what you say . " " I must ring off . " He sounded distant . " You should contribute  --  " The phone went dead . When Nick Ray answered the telephone at Burbank ProjectionRoom io , I heard old movie music , upbeat and static . " I want to hear about discovering Sal Mineo , " I said . " No , no , " he said , and paused . He stopped , as though time had literally slowed down his brain . " There 's no point . " " Well , it would set the record straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece whether I talk to you or not , " I said . " If we talk , I 'll be closer to the truth . " This is an argument I often use . " What is it you want ? " he asked after another pause . " I want to write how you found him . " " It 's too painful , " he said at last . I tried a different tack . " What 's that in the background ? " He pronounced each word slowly , as if he was reading a sad poem . " Rebel Without a Cause . "  | " Why are you screening it ? " It was touching to think of him watching the film that he directed Sal Mineo in twenty years ago . I heard a long sigh . " I never look at it . But the French governmentinvited me to Cannes ... in the spring for that festival , and I thought I 'd speak . . . about Sal . Today , I 'm holding my own memorial service . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , " Can I come see it with you ? " " No . " " Please ? " I said . He cleared his throat . " I 'll do what 's best for Sal . " " I can be right over . " He did n't answer . " Thanks , " I said . " Oh , if you come  --  " " What ? " " Last week at the funeral I told that singer friend of Sal 's he could watch the film sometime .... " He hung up . Mark sounded exhausted when I called . " Okay , " he said . " MaybeI 'll come on by . Maybe I wo n't . Do n't wait for me , now . " I drove up Laurel Canyon and over the Hollywood Hills to the valley . It was hot and dusty . I missed the Burbank exit and swore . One end of the movie lot was fenced with chicken wire like a secret military base set against the San Bernardino hills . I slowed down at an entrance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked around to the trunk to check out my missingwindow . Then he returned to his sentry station , called ProjectionRoom io , and waved me through . Inside , the lot was the size of a village , with dirt roads , a long brick office building , wood barracks , and workers driving open electric carts . It was n't what I expected to find at the dream factory . I parked my Dodge outside Projection Room io and . I groped my way to a velour theater seat . When the projection light went on , I turned and saw Mark slouched down in a seat behind me . " Just madep173it , " I said , holding up my broken wristwatch . I could n't see his face , but I thought he nodded . " Roll , " somebody said . I had a rush of nostalgia when Sal Mineo 's face came up on the screen . What a great-looking kid . His soft face was vulnerable , loving . And then I got of glimpse of something . He had gangly limbs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I loved his hurt black eyes that looked inward . I went back to being thirteen . I fell in love with his black pompadour again . I rememberedgoing to Woolworth 's and smearing on pink lipstick and spraying my hair into a pompadour to get my picture taken in the twenty-five-cent photo booth . He played a rich WASP kid named John Crawford , nicknamed " Plato , " and he had a deep voice . He wore a suit , a sweater , and a tie . He adored James Dean , also an intense , misunderstood kid . But Sal Mineo is more extravagantly lost . Dean keeps trying to care for Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood , but he fails Sal the way the real parents in the movie fail . As a kid , I saw this movie twice with my best girlfriend . We were awed because Sal was from the neighborhood , and afterwardwe followed his mother from the bakery to their house . We argued about the way Jimmy Dean opened his mouth when he kissed Natalie Wood . I said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's lunch . It made us giggle . But watching the movie now made me wish I 'd sat next to Mark . I wanted to share his memory of Sal Mineo . I did n't dare turn around to him . I watched Dean playing the loving friend . Sal did n't act effeminate or corny , and he suffered and loved for himself and Jimmy Dean . I watched his mouth tremble while he refused Dean 's offer of a coat when they met in the police station . His black nurse explained that his parents were always away , and that he 'd shot a puppy on his birthday . There was something truly touching about the way Sal slowly opened up to Jimmy Dean . He gave him long , loving looks . When Dean fought with a switchblade , it was Sal Mineo who caught my eye . His hands were clasped , his body contorted with terror . His eyes snapped after Jim won . I loved the way he loved his friend . I wondered how Mark could stand watching Sal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the doomed parts of Dean and himself . Plato was too damaged . His fantasies would never come true . He wanted Dean to take him hunting and eat breakfast with him like his dad used to . But Dean saved his charged , loving glances for Natalie Wood . I shivered when Sal Mineo crouched under a chair in the planetarium and asked James Dean in his low urgent voice , " Do you think the end of the world will come at night or at dawn ? " When the lights went on , Mark had gone . Nick Ray stood up slowly , rubbing the back of his neck . He wore an eyepatch and his thin face was covered with lines . His yellow cotton polo shirt stretched over skinny shoulder blades and the bones of his spine . His hair was a shock of electric white fur , like a dog 's coat . With a small orange scarf tied around his neck , he looked like a cowboy-styleFrench artist . He was a compelling Hollywood director , down on his luck but not on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still good , " I said . " You 're here about Sal . " He drawled like John Wayne , his voice raspy . He lit an unfiltered cigarette and coughed out smoke . His movements were as slow as his words . " That movie is about a kid who wants one day in his life that 's not confused , " Ray said . " Sal 's the rebel , like in the title . " He paced the slanted aisle , grasping the backs of the chairs for support . " You 're not asking me about Joe Smith who worked his whole life in a hardware store in Newark , New Jersey . Sal was a complex man . I do n't think he had one unconfused day in his life after he met me . " His words sounded somehow veiled , as if he was a poet or a minister . I wanted to ask him why he blamed himself , but he continueddrawling . " You 're talking about a moral man .. . dined by royalty , nominated for an Academy award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A moral man ? " " Yeah , but to do art , you got to be ruthless , " he said , and coughed again on the smoke . " He was n't ruthless ? " I already knew the answer . " A star needs the steel of a Joan Crawford ... but Sal , instead of taking , he gave away . " He drew his eyebrows together . " I doubt Sal knew when he was getting ripped off . "  |p175After  a while I asked , " When did you last see him ? " " Not long ago , " he said . " He stopped by to thank me for something . I did a screen test for one of the boys , Mark . You could see Sal all over him . Chris Franklin too . Sal was a good director . He was going to direct a hit film one day . " " It does n't sound so bad , " I said . " What does n't ? " " A life where your flaw is you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with being a boy and a star . He 'd never be back there again , and these boys got to be his obsession . " " Why was he obsessed ? " I asked . " Back when he was a boy , the world turned upside down just for him . His dreams came true faster than he dreamed them . " " So he wanted to be a child star again ? " " He wanted that feeling of sudden change , when he went from being just a boy to somebody that strangers loved  --  not just liked , but loved . " Ray opened his arms wide at the small movie screen and almost fell backward . Then he sat down and rubbed a finger around his eye . " Who killed him ? " I asked . " Sal drank five cups of coffee a day . I do n't think he smoked cigarettes . I made him espresso when he came by . He was n't selfdestructivelike that . He was n't a serious user of anything . " Ray stopped rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boys . He lived in Westwood for a while , just to look at kids . That 's what he said . I think some little boy got emotional . Sal was n't about to be tied down . How many astute conversationscan you have with little people ? But it was n't sadomasochism . " He pronounced the word as if he 'd wanted to spit . " What about Chris Franklin ? " " What about him ? " " He wanted to move in with him , " I said . " That fellow came out here to build a career . He 's going to be a star . He 's got the steel . The reason their lives worked for so long is they were never together . " " He did n't get too emotional over Sal ? " " I could n't say . " " How 'd you meet Sal ? " " He played the young prince on Broadway in The King and I , the King 's son . He tested great with Jimmy . "  | " How great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hit you between the eyes . He was the same age and coloring as my own son , but Sal had the vulnerability . " " What was the test like ? " He heaved himself to his feet . His dungarees were tight , his brown boots scuffed . " We cut that scene . . .. It was after Jim drops Nat off and drives Plato home . A siren wails . Then Sal looks at him , shy , making friends , My mom 's in Hawaii . ' Jim giggles , Hey , do n't tell me she going bongo , bongo with the coconuts ? ' " Sal ca n't stop laughing and Jim ca n't stop laughing . Then Jim says , Buzz exploded , he blew up , boom ' or something like that , and Sal loves it . He keeps laughing . They start screaming and laughing . They never laid eyes on each other before . It happened in a minute . " He lit a cigarette and coughed smoke . " Now I 'm going to ask you to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about this much . But some things bear saying on some days . I find myself guilty . I helped Jimmy make that kid what he became . " He turned his back to me and kept talking . " Sal never seemed gay . No limp wrist , no swish  --  there was nothing like that . " " How could Jimmy Dean do that , make him gay ? " " I 'm getting there . Love . Love was necessary for the role . Sal had to explore that part of himself that would love Jimmy . Now , Jimmy was an easy person to love , and to hate . A child plays naturally . An actor lives in a world of fantasy and play . There 's no bad child actor . The sad part is how a child ca n't tell the difference between games and real life . Those games Jimmy played twisted him up . " " Why did he do it ? " " Jimmy fell in love with the kid . He knew it , and I knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was helping the film . " " What was he doing ? " " Well , we were on location at Griffith Park . I heard him explainingthings to Sal . He was saying , You know how I am with Nat '  --  that 's Natalie Wood  --  Well , why do n't you pretend I 'm her and you 're me . ' He got Sal to look at him and rub his shouldera certain way . Jimmy 'd say , Pretend you want to touch myp177hair but you 're shy . ' Then Jimmy says , ' I 'm not shy like you . I love you . I 'll touch your hair . ' . . . Jimmy was an easy man to hate . . . and I hated hearing him talk to that boy . " " But you did n't do anything . " " I took one look at that kid 's face . . . he was transcendent , the feeling coming out of him . You saw the film . It was something to cry from , so I tiptoed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound barrier . It was that same scene where he asks Jimmy to go hunting and sleep over his house and eat breakfast . " Ray clapped his hands . " If I can sing on the way back from work at three in the morning , well , I feel good . That night I started whistling and thinking , hey , they 're going to like my film in Paris , France . " " You were ruthless enough , " I said . " You see what I 'm saying . " He sighed . " Think of what Sal Mineo was up against . Jimmy had power . Every kid in America was mumbling his words , combing his hair back , and looking intense . Think of how Sal felt close up to that , and then later on kids got the same thing for Sal . " I was starting to sweat . The air conditioning was n't working anymore . After a while , Ray slowly pulled out another cigarette , and while it dangled in his mouth , he asked me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you going to grant me absolution ? " He lit his match and laughed his dry laugh . It made his arm shake the match out . Then he said , " I remember the Academy Awards that year . He was nominated for best supporting actor . I sat him down and said , Sal , go home , forget this town . Go to Syracuse business school . ' I wanted to see him untouched . " " But he did n't do what you said . " " Too much guts . " Ray was rubbing the top of his head . " I remember that award night . He brought his whole family out here to Hollywood . Simple peasant types , rolling in his new money . He got such applause . Nat cried for him . " " Well , he was good . " " Nobody ever pushed him further as an actor than Jimmy and me . " Ray started turning up theater seats , preparing to leave . " When did you last see him ? " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stopped in when he was out at the beach visiting some producer couple . He liked the husband . Millionaires . " " Lyons ? " I asked . Yeah , maybe so . " " How long ago was that ? " " The day he was murdered , I saw him out there . " " Oh , you mean for the party , " I said . " They throw afternoon parties ? " he asked , and turned off the projection light from the back of the room . I felt my way up the aisle . " Wait a minute . You mean he was out there that afternoon ? " " Yeah . " " Visiting that couple ? " " Well , look , I ca n't remember why he was out there , but that was the only reason he ever did come all the way to Malibu . So maybe I just assumed . " Kate Lyons had lied to me . " Did he say anything ? " " Yeah , something about one of the boys . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some producer about it . " " Mark , " I said , wincing as the sunlight hit my eyeballs . " He was worried about Mark . " " No , I do n't think that was it , " Ray said . " If you were to ask me , I 'd say it was something about Chris being in trouble . " He tripped on the front step of the projection room . I grabbed his arm . I felt bone right under the skin . " What kind of trouble ? " " I never asked Sal , " Ray said . No wonder the cops wanted Chris for questioning . But I had no clue what Chris 's trouble might have been , or why Sal thought he could help . Or why Mark had led me to believe Sal 's dealings with Kate Lyons involved him rather than Chris Franklin . " Why did you fly east for the funeral ? " I asked . He made a gesture of dismissal with his free hand . " This is it . After this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were both fighting the sun . It made me feel out of breath . " Usually I go to funerals to lament myself . " He lit a cigarette and exhaled the white smoke . " Everybody does . I did n't feel that way about Sal . I went to applaud . I admired his guts . Hep179stuck to it . He was n't some quitter . No Syracuse business school for Sal . " I watched his yellow jersey disappear as he walked down an alley between two long shacks . A minute later , I pulled a note from Mark off my car window . He was waiting for me at the commissary . I asked directions of two women wearing nineteenth-century crinolines and twirling parasols . I did n't gape at them . A hundred feet away , the commissary was a bungalow with a front porch . It had a faded linoleum floor , and a fan circulated hot air smelling of soup and disinfectant . It could have been an employees ' cafeteria at a Minneapolis department store . Two salesgirls behind a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of felt pennants stamped HOLLYWOODLAND . In the back of the dining room , Mark was drinking club soda from a plastic cup under a huge photograph of Marlon Brando . He was playing with the salt shaker . Next to him was a table full of young people sketching on napkins and arguing . They looked like graduate students in engineering . " Film editors , " Mark said . He read my face . " This place is n't what you 'd expect . " He pulled out a chair for me . " Too many things in life like that . " Although his eyes were hidden by aviator sunglasses , I knew he 'd been crying . " You walked out of that movie , " I said . He shivered . " Reality is weird . I kept seeing his face , remembering the last time we ate supper , the way he talked with his hands . Now , you tell me , he does n't look like a dead man up there on the screen , does he ? " I touched his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film editors were passing around a napkin with a drawing on it . He pulled an ice cube out of the glass and rubbed it on his forehead . " Boy , " he said , " it 's fucked up . The police pulled Chris in last night for lie detectors and shit . " " But they let him go . " " Yeah , but he says pressure 's on to arrest me . " He pushed a knuckle under his sunglasses . " It 's one bad dream , " he murmured . " Wake me when it 's over . "  | " Do n't worry , " I said automatically . But this was terrible news . I finished his club soda and said , " They are probably trying to trick Chris . He 's the one they 're after . " I looked at Mark to see if he believed me . " They 're afraid to arrest somebody well known , " I added . He pushed his chair back from the table . It screeched against the linoleum . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and the film editors stared . Outside on the porch , I caught up with him . " Look , do n't sit back and take it , " I said . " Let me tell you something  --  " He loped away . I saw the bounce to his gait like Sal 's . I hurriedafter him . " Kate Lyons says her telephone message on Sal 's service was n't for Sal , it was for you  --  " I began . He turned , still stepping away from me . " Not now , sugar , I respect what you 're doing , but I 'm going home and holing up " He strode away three steps , turned , and came back . I held out my arms . He rested his elbows on my shoulders and bent one knee against mine . " Okay , how about me helping shut out the whole world ? " I stretched up and kissed his ear . " But we have to talk . " He pulled his head back . " Not about cops and murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into step . " James Dean was something , " I said . " It 's a funny thing about Jimmy . " " What 's funny ? " " For Sal , Jimmy never really died . He was always in touch , and that 's the way I feel about Sal . " " You do n't mean literally ? " Mark gave me a fast look out of the corner of his eye . " Do n't forget , sugar , this is California . " " What 's that mean ? " " Many 's the time Sal talked to Jimmy 's spirit . " I did n't want to know about this . It gave me the creeps . But I was a reporter , for God 's sake . " What did his spirit tell him ? " " Many , many things , " Mark said , " about being a director , about life . " He opened his car door and felt around near the gas pedal for the keys . I wondered why he drove a car that was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trunk and one big chrome tailfin were smashed.  | " The last time he asked Jimmy for a sign was the summer of 1967 . I was sleeping at his place at the beach . " " You saw it ? " " No , I felt it . It was noon and the temperature of the house dropped twenty degrees . Not a window open . It was a visit of something . " Now Mark did seen weird . It sounded like a fantasy , as though both of them had flipped . " I do n't know , " I said aloud , and leaned against Mark 's door . The handle was wrapped with silver tape . " Sal thanked Jimmy for coming , " he said . I was remembering Jerry 's babbling about the devil . It was probably just an unpleasantcoincidence . " Sara , do n't be such a bigot . Some folks wo n't deal with black people , some folks wo n't deal with Orientals . They draw lines . They make judgments . Sal never went on like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigot about Orientals , " I said contemptuously , " and talking to Jimmy Dean after he 's dead . " " Well , you ca n't say why folks get born and why they die , " Mark said . " I ai n't as sure of things as you . " " Do you plan to talk to Sal Mineo ? " Mark whistled something fast . " Well , what did Jimmy Dean tell him ? " I asked . He wrapped his arms around himself and shivered . " He said Brandon DeWilde was going to die , and he told him how it would come about . " " Did it ? " " Yeah . " Mark twisted his head to watch the film editors strollingpast . " And that 's when Sal stopped trying to contact Jimmy ever again . " This was too much . " Look , I do n't get it , " I burst out . He sighed , and leaned over the steering wheel . " I do n't expect it of you . I expect you to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to your car . " I slid into the hot leather seat . " This Cadillac 's seen better days , " I said . He pumped the gas pedal , flooded the engine , turned it off . " It 's a 1962 Eldorado . It 's got eighty thousand miles , and the dealer insignia says GRACELAND. "  | " Elvis Presley ? " " Right . " " You got this car from Elvis Presley 's hometown ? " " No , Elvis buys folks new Cadillacs , hundreds of them , the way you 'd hand somebody a stick of gum . " " He gave it to you ? " " No , Elvis bought this baby for a black kid from Memphis who sold it to me . " He got the motor going . " The top does n't work ? " " Never has , " he said . " Sal called my car white trash '  --  " " Mark , " I said , " I need to understand things . " He hit the steering wheel lightly with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear you . "  |p183I  sprawled back on Mark 's leather sofa . The sky was cloudless . When I picked up my head , I saw treetops and curves of distant mountains . The room was cool . At my left , a slow-moving red fish in Mark 's tank was hypnotizing me . I felt drowsy . Then his knee nudged me . There was something like heat transmitted every time he stared at me . He plopped a silk pillow on my chest and I hugged it . He sat down , his back pressing my side . I struggled to sit up . " No , " he said , " you look real comfortable , " and he swung his long legs up along the edge of the sofa . " Tell me , " he whispered sweetly , closing his eyes , his head in my lap , " tell me something that 's happened to you on the subject of love . " I took a deep breath , shy , feeling his body . " Is this a game ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved asking things . I called him the erotic politician , ' and he knew parts of Lolita by heart . Just by watching somebody dance , he 'd know what turned them on . " How 'd he dance ? " " He was shy . He hated folks watching him . But Lord , he loved watching them . " " That means something , " I said , leaning over to see him . " He watched over us , " he said , and reached his fingers up to trace my mouth . Then he said an amazing thing . " I want you . "  |p184I  could n't read the expression on his face . He was smiling shyly , his eyes closed . He murmured , " It 's your mind  --  your brain makes you real special . " I laid clown next to him on my back . He poked my head . " Your mind 's like an acrobat . I just wish it did n't work overtime . " I hid my face in his shoulder . " First I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and then you tell me . " Instead I rolled away , facing the back of the couch . I did n't relish hearing about his past love affairs . He tried pulling me toward him . But I went stiff . " I 'll tell you what I do best , " he said . " Okay ? " I did n't answer . " Sara , I listen good , real good . " " That 's your best thing ? " I twisted my neck around to see if he was kidding me . " It 's half the story when it comes to sex , " he said . " What 's the rest ? " " Attitude , " he smiled at me . " You need a great attitude . " Then I let myself feel his breath on the back of my neck . I heard him whistling . I had the feeling he always heard music in his head . I faced him . " What 's the difference between making love to a man and making love to a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess deep down you despise men who 've been with me . " I hated to hear his voice so flat . Jumping up , I straddled him and his body made a new heat between my legs . " Mark , you 're special , " I said . He pulled my face down and brushed my lips with his mouth . " Why ask me about women ? " he mumbled . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " It worries me , the whole thing . " He put a palm on each side of my face and turned my head so he could whisper in my ear . " I do n't remember  --  I swear I do n't remember making love to anybody in the whole damn world but you . " His voice set up a friction in my ear that alerted my whole body . I flopped back down flat . " No memory at all , " I teased . " It 's a medical tragedy . The war  --  you lost it in the war . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare and tragic case of sexual am-nesia . " " You need surgery . " " I need an answer to my question , " he said . " I ca n't remember your question , " I giggled . " Tell me a filthy story , something you reckon is real wild that has some mystery to it , and I 'll do the judging . " I sat up on the edge of the couch , crossed my legs , the plump silk cushion on my lap . " Well , it was midnight , and I was surrounded . Bank robbers to the right of me . Bank robbers to the left of me  --  " He hit the pillow in my lap with his palm . " Now , sugar , I said erotic . " " Oh , okay , then listen to this , " I said . " It was my birthday a few years ago . I got standing-room tickets , me and the entertainmentreporter , to the hot play in town , The Cherry Orchard . Well , in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too gorgeous , like a god or something . " " Too gorgeous , now ? " Mark asked politely . " Let me tell it my way . " " Oh , good Lord , yeah . Too good-looking . " " His shirt was unbuttoned . He had this sultry smile . " " Oh , no . Sultry  --  that 's disgusting . " I saw myself in his eyes , and I knew I could fall into them . " Will you let me tell my story ? " I asked tartly . " A thousand pardons . " " Well , this man was staring at me . Giving me those love-me looks . He put his hand inside his shirt , and then he started to flush . " " Hey , now  --  an actor , " Mark said . " Who in hell was he ? " " Not yet , " I said . " Wait , wait some more , " he interrupted again . " These looks , they did n't get you ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your scene . You are no kin to erotic politicians , " he said . " But you have n't heard my story . I grab this entertainment reporter and say , ' Hey , look at that fag . Why is he staring at me ? ' I mean , he was wearing tight Italian clothes . And straight men did n't act that way , at that time in New York anyway . "  | " What way ? " Mark asked . " I do n't know . Flashy . Like they can do anything because they 're great-looking . " I glanced furtively at his face . He had n't taken offense when I said " fag , " but he was hard for me to read . " Meanwhile , " I continued , " this reporter did a double-take . He acted like I 'd just pointed out the Grand Canyon . He said to me , ' Sara , you overeducated jerk . That 's no faggot , that 's the biggest heartthrob on the silver screen . ' " Mark snapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks . " " I was n't so dumb , " I said . " Dumb is n't the problem , " he said . " So who was he ? " " That 's the mystery , " I said . " Lloyd Bridges ? " he asked sarcastically . I ignored him . " Anyway , the guy disappeared . The play started , and I sat down in the aisle . Then somebody bumped my shoulder . When I turned my head , I nearly died . It was him givingme that love-me look . " " But you did n't think anything of it , " Mark said . " Well , I kept my eyes on the play . If I moved my head , I could 've touched his mouth . " " That made you feel bad ? " " No , but I heard stories about him chasing women . " " Oh ? Then what ? " " The lights went on , and I looked over , but he had disappeared . " Mark winked at me . " Cat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the guy could n't take his eyes off me . I told him it had nothing to do with me . " " Scared as a jackrabbit , " Mark said . " Well , but out in the lobby , there he was , sitting in a telephone booth . He waved like we had known each other for years . I almost fell over . " " He really turned you on ? " Mark said . " Not him , just the attention . " " Tell it your way , " Mark said . " Well , afterward , I drank two brandy Alexanders , like an idiot . My pal drank bourbon and made a pass at me . It was ridiculous . Of course , it took me weeks to stop seeing that man every single minute . I dreamed about him . "  | " Finished ? " Mark sat up and threw himself against me . " WalterMatthau ? " I laughed and I lay back . It felt as if we 'd been touching for years . He kissed my neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shirt . I was getting goose bumps . " I 'm not done , " I said . " Good , " he said , " because that story sucks . " I brushed his hair out of his eyes . " This is a saga , " I said , " coveringfive years . " He nodded solemnly and threw himself back down on the couch . " Burt Reynolds ? " he asked suddenly . " Not telling , but a couple years later , " I recited in a singsong , " in fact , last month , I was trying to get to interview a drinking buddy of his who hates the press . " " This all passes for erotic back East ? " Mark closed his eyes and folded his hands on his chest . " Do n't ruin my story , " I said . " Do it , " he said . " Well , I heard that my movie star had hired the pal to write a screenplay , so I called his office at the studio . The entertainmentreporter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classy , " Mark said . " Why ? " " Out here the rule is you do n't bother calling folks back who might be less important than you . " I remembered what Kate Lyons said about sex . " So you only call up . " He laughed , " You catch on quick . " I said , " But listen , my guy did call me back to have lunch . Also , believe it or not , I forgot the way he made me feel at the theater . Do n't ask me why . " " I do n't have to , " Mark said . " Why ? " I asked him . " You 're scared silly . " " Well , anyway , at lunch , when anybody ogled him , he looked at me . Me . He seemed fascinated . He kept asking me questions . " " Right , because he 's into seeing himself in your eyes . That 's real seduction , " Mark said.  |p188I  raised my eyebrows . " Yeah , well he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Damn right , " said Mark . " A real star 's into big-time gratification . Mind-fucking 's an art . In exchange he 'll show you a greatpicture of yourself , getting you high on you , and stuck on him . " " But nothing happened . " " Well , he gets what he wants , " Mark said . " That shows how much you know . He did n't even flirt with me . I kissed him goodbye on the cheek . He flushed . I was flying to Chicago for an ERA celebrity bash and so was he , so he asked me to fly with him . " Mark yawned . " He was studying you , figuring why you were going to love him . " " Well , two clays later on the plane , he changed . He grinned at me until I wanted to hide , but I stared back . He asked about me . " " Like how ? " " Well , how long had I been faithful to my boyfriend . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , " I said . " Four years . " " When 're the good parts coming ? " I ignored Mark 's sarcasm . " Then I told him he had to answer my questions . " " Like what ? " " Oh , about his relationship to his mother and his first sexual experiences . " " He sure does n't sound like Paul Newman . " " I 'll never tell . " " Okay , what 'd he say ? " " He told me that in the third grade he hated school , because the girls would pin him against the schoolyard fence and kiss him . " " You believed him ? " " I guess . He told me how good he was at making love . " " In graphic detail ? " " Yes , for hours . " " What 'd lie say , sugar ? " I twisted my torso around , " I ca n't remember it . But I told him what the entertainment director heard from some starlet . "  | " What 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made all the right moves . It was perfect except for one thing . " " What ? " " Something was missing . " " What ? " " The man himself . He just was n't there . " " Smart starlet , " Mark rolled his eyes . " She 's right , and you were all alone in that airplane too . " " No , he was there . How many women get a movie star like him making eyes at them ? " " Seven hundred trillion , " Mark said . " You 're saying he was n't there for me because he 's running from girl to girl . " I narrowed my eyes . " He 's not really looking to love another person , he 's looking for a better view of himself , like Narcissus in the myth . He 's trying to find his image in each girl 's eyes . " " Lecture me tomorrow . " Mark patted his mouth over a yawn . " Anyway , I bet your friend had something snappy to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , ' Poor girl , she 's right . I guess I just was n't there for her . ' " " He wins , " Mark said . " He 's not there for anybody . He 's just viewing himself in action . " " That 's what I meant . " " Okay , so what else did he say ? " " That he was n't sure about making love to me , anyway . " " Why ? " " Because he said it 'd be great , but I 'd be upset after four times . " Mark looked interested . " Covering himself . Why ? " " I 'd get hurt because his feelings would n't change . " " Good move . " Mark laughed . Something slipped into my mind , and I stopped smiling . I wondered how long Mark would stick around for anybody . " Hey ? " He ran his finger over my eyebrows . " What else didhe say ? " He had me talking again . I loved telling this story . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andp190describing sex in this low , teasing voice . I knew it was n't real life . I told him he was the best movie . " " He did n't try anything ? " " Not really . I told him that I liked him and that was enough . But he raised his voice and said , ' Fucking is scoring . Fucking is scoring . ' I told him he was wrong , and we did n't talk like that outside the bedroom in New York . " " Then what ? " " Oh , well , here comes the kinky part . He stood up to go to the bathroom . I was so giddy . I was n't myself . " " Who were you then ? Bette Davis ? " I ignored his question . " So when he teased me , ' Wan na come with me ? ' I jumped . He was already climbing over my legs . " " So what was the big move ? " " I said , ' Please , let me come and just watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to tell my grandchildren how I watched you pee on an airplane . ' " " And then ? " " Well , he got this worried look . Then he pushed me back into my seat , and said , " Do n't be silly . I could n't do it . " " You wanted to score off him your way , but he did n't go for it , " Mark said . " Power freaks , the both of you . " " Not me . " I was indignant . " Okay , okay . " Mark grabbed me from behind and pulled me down on the sofa . He buried his face in the nape of my neck . His breath was like a warm massage . " Okay , you 're no power freak . You 're just kinky , " he said . " I 'm not kinky , " I said . " Really ? " " So when we got off the plane , I asked when he was going to introduce me to his friend , and he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it for me ? ' " " I came up with ten things , but he kept saying , ' What 's in it for me ? ' Then he dropped me off at the party in his limousine and that was it . " " How did you feel ? " Mark asked . " Lonely , like the movie projector broke down and left me in the dark . " But a week later , he asked me out to dinner . He said that itp191was off the record . I got there early . When he walked in , people swallowed their wineglasses . He had his writer friend with him . He really delivered . I was stunned . " " Did you get the story ? " Mark asked . " No way . I tried . The friend hated me . He had a coughing fit . I never saw my actor again . " " You get depressed ? " " Well , yeah . " " You might 've learned something . " " And got my feelings hurt . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's not that unique to have sex with him , " I said . " With one of the most beautiful men in the world ? How would you know ? " " Oh , journalists gossip . I hear stories . " Mark started tickling me . I rolled off the couch and onto the floor out of his reach . He laughed down at me . " So that 's the closest you come to letting your work into your life  --  " He opened his arms and I sat up and threw myself at him . " The lady is a voyeur , " he continued . " That 's why you wanted to watch a Hollywood mystery star in the bathroom . You do n't live . You watch . " I started to unbutton his shirt , but he stopped me . " Come on , " I said . " Well , I 'm worried , " he said , buttoning his shirt . " You 'll get the story and split for home , become a virgin again , or whateveract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I 'm work . Somebody'spaying you money to hang out with me . " I was touched . But I bantered , " If I was getting paid for this , it would cost somebody a lot more than my salary . " Then he asked , " What do you want from me ? " " Pleasure . I want pleasure , " and I started pulling on his buttonsagain . " That 'll take some work , " he said . " Teach me , " I said . " Promise me you 'll do what I say . " Mark extended his hand like he was making a pact . " No way . "  | " Then forget it , " he said , and rolled away from me . After staring at the red fish dart around the tank , I said , " Okay , promise . " But I waved my crossed fingers at him . " You do n't mean that promise , but you will , " Mark said , and he pulled up my skirt and buried his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensed and then relaxed . Then something new happened . A sexual fantasy . In my mind I saw him lying on top of me making love . I heard him breathing hard . Then I saw him licking my mouth , his hair falling around my face . My legs began to contract in spasms . " What 's going through your wonderful mind ? " he asked . " I 'll do anything , " I said . He lay still , his breath on my thigh . I tried to stop the shaking in my legs . " Do n't tense up , " he said . " I love it when your muscles go crazy . Sara , give up on that newspaper story and move right in here with me . " He was joking , but I did n't laugh . " I do n't think it 's right . " " Virtue , " he interrupted , " is its only reward . " He sat up and pulled off my underpants . " Okay , " I said , " humiliate me . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen too many filthy movies . " " None , " I said proudly . " Too bad , " he said , and unbuttoned his silk shirt . I picked up my head to find his mouth and pulled him to me . I licked wet skin inside his lower lip . His lips trembled . Then I kissed him hard , and pushed my mouth inside his mouth . I slid my palm down his stomach and started to pull on his belt . I wanted to lick down inside his pants , touch him , swallow him everywhere with my mouth and both hands . I wanted him to want to make love to me . He pulled his pants down his legs and then threw them over the coffee table . I reached out to him , but he said , " Wait , " and slowly unbuttoned my blouse , taking my arms out of the sleeves as though I was more delicate than flesh and bone . He stood up naked on the couch and lifted me to my feet . Then he knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thoughp193he was unveiling a work of art . He held my hand while I stepped out of the skirt . Still kneeling , he moved his lips slowly over my body into secret places . A frenzy was building inside me . He turned me around and around , slowly , searching for the places where sensationsbegin . He caressed the skin of my neck , ran his tongue down my back , pausing to kiss me wetly as he moved his mouth over my stomach , pressed his hand between my legs , listening for my breaths , flicking his tongue deep inside me , exploring every wrinkle , teasing every nerve ending . I felt wanton , and my knees buckled . My body was crying for him to touch me more . He licked tendrils of my pubic hair , caressed under my breasts , and rubbed his forefinger gently on my mouth . Then he picked up my hand and , still looking into my eyes , he kissed each finger and licked my palm . We lay clown facing each other on our sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed it again , and put it between my legs . I felt the soft hairs and the moisture and then the slick wet skin of my sex . My clitoris was a tiny miracle , a dot disappearinginto the smooth flesh . " What 're you feeling ? " His voice was soft like he 'd been sleeping . I did n't know . But he put my hand on his hard cock . He groaned and squeezed my fingers around him . Then he teased me with his fingertips until he was holding my sex , his hand curved over me . I bent forward and kissed the tip of his cock , and the skin felt soft , wet , and smooth as the inside of my own mouth . " Later , " he said , in an urgent whisper , " I 'll show you how to drive me crazy . " He started to move his fingers between my legs and within a minute my body was moving in ways I had never dared imagine . Then he took his hand away and I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of his touch and the tension of squeezing the wet and warm places inside me made me go into spasms . " Do it yourself , " he said softly , watching my face . He put my hand between my legs again . The folds of my skin felt loose and wet and strange . I had never touched myself when I was this aroused . I shivered and jerked my hand away.  |p194He  forced my hand back . I felt so powerful and so confused . It was up to me to make the feelings build , and I could n't . " I 'm here , " Mark said , " and I adore you . Come on , you know what to do . Drive yourself crazy . You know what to do . " I hesitated . " But you make the rules . " " I 'm telling you the game , " he said . " Play it . " Still my hand did not stir . He guided it in a long delicate caress from my knees up inside my thighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . He was kissing my ear and saying over and over , " I 'm here . Do it . Do it . " I pressed myself , searching for the way he 'd touched me . His hand hovered above my fingers , flicking at my wrist . I felt skin , wet , slick , and unfamiliar . Beyond all control or sanity , I understood that I could make my legs and sex contract and shake and feel a tension that was better than anything . It was hard . I was still too self-conscious . My hand was turning slick with my own juices . But then my body felt graceful like we were swimming together again . I became more sure of myself . My caresses lengthened , my spasms deepened and spread down my legs and up my back . I felt his mouth traveling in gasps over my body . I faltered , but his lips found the muscle spasms , driving them further and making my flesh prickle with a hundred new sexual openings instead of one sexual core . I screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex everywhere . Then I heard an odd silence , as if someone stopped singing . I stretched long and supple . " Here 's another game , " he said . He spread my knees wide and put his head between them . Then he burrowed his face deep in the folds of my sex . A new rush shot between my legs . He murmured , " We 're at a formal dinner , sugar . " His voice made music start again . " The maid has just filled the wineglasses . Now close those eyes . Pretend there 's gleaming silverware , candles , and pretty flowers . You 're sitting next to an art critic . Your knees are hidden under a yellow linen tablecloth . Nobody but you knows that I am kneeling under the table , between your knees , pressing my tongue into your underpants , begging you to pull them off so I can do this to you . "  |p195He  rubbed his wet face against my thigh . " Wait , " he said , sitting up . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing 's happening . You have to keep a straight face and say , ' Pass the salt , ' and , ' The peas are excellent this spring . ' " He looked at me for a minute . I licked my lips and tried to think . I could barely control the muscles of my face . I watched the smile start at the corner of his wet mouth . I wanted him back between my legs . He laughed in a husky undertone . " Okay , we 'll wait on this one . " And he disappeared between my legs again to drive me toward the unbearable tension of orgasm . My whole body leapt and jumped , taking off wonderfully , over a long , slow minute . I lost all sense of time  --  me , Sara Martin . I was in a dream that never ended . Unaccountably , I burst out crying . I felt so happy , lightheaded , as though I was floating weightless above the brown leather . Mark was holding his breath , concentrating and staring intently at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a jerk . " Hey , what about you ? " I said . " You 're too self-sacrificing . " " You do n't know anything . " His voice croaked with fatigue . " So teach me . " I stopped worrying about my tears . It felt great to cry from sexual release . Another new experience . I kissed him . " I love making you feel good , " he said . " Back home in Charleston , we learn that stuff before we learn how to eat hot cereal with a spoon . " He was lying on his back , his arms under his head and his cock straining in the air . I crouched above him and kissed the tip of his cock and felt it tremble against my lips . I rested my cheek on the white skin of his hip where his bathing suit coveredhim . Talking in a rhythm , he said , " It 's yours , babe , love me there . Love me . " I took a soft tendril of his hair into my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aah , uum , no , " he said , and grabbed my head gently . " It 's time for lessons again . I 'm the expert . " He pulled me to him , and kissed me hard to keep my feelings from getting hurt . I would probably have agreed to anything . My body was stillp196ringing from his hands on my skin . I wanted to make him come as badly as I 'd ever wanted anything . " Now , just wet it all over . " I licked at the soft skin until it was slippery against my lips . " Good , " he said , " you 're getting real close to giving me pure joy . I wish I could describe it . " He almost lost his words in a groan . I was rolling his hard flesh around in my mouth . " Tense your lips and keep them over your teeth , " he said , " and grip me hard with your lips . " I felt his quickened breath and a small movement beginning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your mouth and suck on it with the inside of your cheeks and the back of your tongue . " My mouth was tired . But I did n't mind . Mark was patting me erratically on the head . " Now relax , relaxyour throat , " he moaned . " Take me deep inside , do n't let it close up , and flick your tongue on the front part . " He curled my hand around the slippery base of his cock . I gagged as my throat contracted around the firm skin , and my eyes filled with tears . " Relax . It 's good , " he said , and cleared his throat . " It 's great . It 's a matter of training your throat . Just do n't do that this time . Concentrate on this . " He took my hand and made a circle of my thumb and forefinger around the base of his cock , and he closed my fingers tight , pushing them into a stroking rhythm . He wiped the tears off my cheeks tenderly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremble more . He squeezed my fingers again around the base of his organ . It was slippery , and it was hard for me to remember all the differentmovements at once . I kept my mouth taut and full of him , following the rhythm of his hips and pushing him further and further into it . . I wanted to keep flicking my tongue around the tip because it made him gasp every time . I gripped him hard with my fingers , sliding in the saliva and the wet to create more friction and feeling . I found his rhythm , coming harder and faster . When I felt him tremble inside my mouth , he whispered , " Is it okay to do it like this ? I mean for you ? " I loved being so close to his pleasure . I was still sucking him in slow strong movements , and the slippery wet skin was like myp197own flesh inside my mouth . Then I quickened the tempo , my mouth drunkenly pulling and licking , trying to unlock the sensationsexploding inside him . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to suckle and cover my teeth with my lips , and my tears became part of the mix of saliva and wet . His liquid rushed through my mouth , and my lips went slack . I swallowed the soapy fluids . He was trembling , still hard and in my mouth . I felt as if he were part of my body now . Then he went soft and smooth . He sighed and pushed the wet hair off my forehead . " You 'll get good , real good at this , and guys will be lining up at a hundred bucks a shot . The barber pole must be worth that much in New York . " I slid him out of my mouth . " The barber pole ? " He smiled drowsily . " Sugar , the way your tongue goes around from top to bottom like those red , white , and blue lines . " I 'd have a hard time explaining the barber pole to anybody in my life , even Joe . For four years , Joe and I got each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must have gone crazy together . But I could n't remember it . It had happened when I was somebody else . I drifted into sleep , woke up , tangled with him . The room was gray . The sun had set . I wanted to look at him sleeping . I snuck my knee out from under his thigh , listening , matching my movementsto his breathing rhythms . He sighed once , and clasped me tight , his right arm around my waist . His hair was curling , sweaty . His lips were full , more childlike . He was a mystery to me , a stranger . I had so many doubts . But I wanted him . I felt like an explorer who 'd just stumbled on a new range of mountains and then , over the knoll , on a new uncharted ocean . Balboa at the Pacific must have thought somethingsimilar . It was a whiff of possibility , the idea that life might satisfy me more . I did n't want to think it . I did n't want to sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too badly it would turn sour . I live my life cursed by diffidence and decency . I believe the big sin is catching myself really wanting something . I could n't eat less , work harder , be kind to the unfortunate , and assume I 'd be rewarded . Mark had shown me too muchp198pleasure . It did n't make me grateful . I was scared of what I might lose . " What 's happening ? " he whispered through a yawn . I stared at his bottom lip , caked in one corner . " Answer me . " He threw his arm heavy from sleep back across me . " Nothing . " " Come on , babe , " he said , rocking my hips a little with his hand . " Do n't be scared . " " Well , you 're different . It does n't make sense . " " You 're afraid , " he said , closing his eyes , " because you want to be happy . " " Maybe , " I whispered . Suddenly I craved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate-chip cookies . I put my thumbnail in my mouth and sucked it . He was asleep . When I closed my eyes to sleep I coughed and jerked up on one elbow . The living room was dark except for the city lights below and the glowing aquarium . I felt like I was on a night flight . It was ridiculous to sleep away the whole evening . I felt defeated . I lowered myself back and frowned in the dark . It was okay for him . He had an excuse . His best friend had been murdered . He needed to distract himself . He could afford to fritter away time.  |p199Nobody  was awake inside the lobby of the Chateau Marmont but Jay , the desk clerk . He looked at me curiously when I asked for my messages . It was seven in the morning , and birds chirruped in some invisible courtyard . I smelled freshly brewed coffee . " Been gone two days ? " He flashed his wide smile . " I been away , " I said . Let him infer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts to tell him some fancy cover story . But my reputation was n't worth a lie to Jay . Usually when I 'm out of town on a story , I take care to get to sleep before midnight and eat protein in the morning . I make myself work twice as hard as anybody else might , and be much less reckless . That 's why I do well . " You know Jimmy Breslin ? " Jay 's teeth flashed white , and he handed me another telephone message . " Yeah , a little . " " When he comes out here , he never sleeps . Lives with his subjectsaround the clock . I bet you 're that good . " He winked and hit his old brass cash register with a flourish . I thanked him and looked over my messages . Two were from Joe , my boyfriend , or former boyfriend . He had called twice around midnight , last night , when I was with Mark . My editor had called the previous afternoon . The remaining three callsp200were from the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in at five A.M. this morning . It was irritating . That call would 've scared me to death . I did n't need to hear from a troublemaker in the dead of the night . I resolved to call him after breakfast and tell him . After I showered and flopped down on my bed , the telephone rang . I thought Mark 'd just woken up . But it was Jerry again . At eight in the morning . I hit my pillow with my fist . " We got some talking to do , " he said . " You do n't get much of a story without me . " " I 'm doing fine , thanks , " I said . " Hey , I 'm not looking for trouble , " he said . I doubted if he did anything else . " Come on over , " he said . " I 'll make it worth your while . " His self-importance was annoying . But I had to talk to the guy . " Do n't call me again in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , I got hot news  --  " " I do n't do business that way , " I interrupted . I could 've kicked myself . He slapped his wife around . She tried to kill me with a hammer . It was n't smart to push him around . His voice was tight with fury . " So you want me to fuck off , right ? I ai n't good enough to talk to you . " He scared me . I swung my legs around and sat on the side of my bed . " I 'd like to see you , " I said , in what I hoped was a pleasant tone . " May I invite you to breakfast ? " " That 's more like it . " " Please meet me , " I went on saying as though he was doing me a favor , " at the Old World restaurant at Sunset and Holloway . You 've a way to get there ? " " Lady , I got wheels . I ai n't that kind of loser . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a bad headache . " " Yeah ? " He did n't sound too interested in my problem . " You buying breakfast ? " " My pleasure , " I said , and sneered into the telephone to make myself feel better . The Old World was filled with people . The man next to mep201was drinking carrot juice on crushed ice . The cashier had red fingernails as long as her fingers . She hit the register with her knuckles . I walked through the place fast , worrying about Jerry . I saw Annie Harmon in the back , pushing ice cubes into a metal ice crusher . " Come here , " she waved . " Pina coladas , " she told me , keeping an eye on the machine . " I do the setups , fresh , every morning . It 's all natural , from the ice cubes to the rum . " She took a look at my face over the top of the machine . " That 's a joke about the rum , " she said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I recognized him walking around the back of the restaurantfrom the direction of Holloway . He was bent over , and fiddling with door handles of cars parked out there . It took him ten minutes to wander to the entrance of the restaurant . He stood by the cash register , cracking his knuckles and bobbing his head until I waved at him . Then he sauntered over , slow , like he had ten million better things to do . The guy had a lot of problems . He stood at my table and tried to give me the eye before he sat down . Annie Harmon dropped two menus on the table and looked dubiously at Jerry . It was amazing how he 'd developed the musclesof his torso and his arms . His legs were short and thin and looked like they could barely support the huge weightlifter 's body . " I do n't like it here , " he told me , shifting in his chair like it was a small cage . His skin was an unhealthy ash yellow . " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " he asked , picking up the menu . While Annie Harmon tried to catch my eye about him , he ordered three hamburgers with bean sprouts , two chocolate milkshakes , and a side order of french fries . To be congenial , I ordered a cup of coffee . While we waited for the food , he picked at a sliver of skin next to his thumbnail . " Breakfast or lunch ? " I asked him . " What ? Oh , breakfast . I 'm a growing boy , " he said and stood up quickly . Without explaining himself , he ran through the restaurant and out the front door . I followed him and watched him dis/appear into a car . A minute later he closed the car door behind him and ran back toward me . " What 's that for ? " I asked . " Forget it , " he said . He was swallowing some things that looked like yellow capsules . I followed him back to our table , but he kept looking over his shoulder as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave me the creeps . When the hamburgers came , he lowered his face to the plate and wolfed them down . I almost said something about his manners . But he was a man who hit women . He made a lot of loud noises with his straw in an effort to finish the second chocolate milkshake . Then he snapped his fingers at Annie and ordered another one . " I was walking around here , " he finally said . " Where ? " " Oh , I went and looked at the place where Cleon told me it happened . " " What else did Cleon tell you ? " " Cleon 's a heavy dude , " he said . He could n't stop glancing around the restaurant like he expected to be menaced any second . I was curious to hear what he 'd say next . I tried to rememberour last talk . His friend Cleon Wilson overheard somebody with blond hair brag about killing a famous Hollywood person , and his wife heard the murderer talking about a cocaine contract . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's into Satanism . " I nodded . " He thinks he can buy his way out of his problem if he gets enough souls and sells them . " " Who to ? " " The devil . Then , come Judgment Day , Cleon goes free . Let somebody else pay . " This Satanism talk reminded me of Sal 's seances with Jimmy Dean . It gave me chills . " How does Cleon collect souls ? " " Oh , you want me to rat on a blood ? No way . " " Well , what about the other guy , the guy who was bragging about stuff ? "  |p203Jerry  leaned forward . " Cleon drove shotgun . " " What do you mean ? " " He was waiting in the car for the blond dude down at the end of the alley . " " What alley ? " " Where the dude got Mineo . " " Whose car was it ? " I asked . " Oh , I do n't know . It was some yellow compact . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " I could get in legal trouble , and I do n't need it . " I tried once more . " Does Cleon get along with the other guy ? " " They understand each other . He had the same feeling , that if he offed somebody , like an animal , it would be collecting souls for Lucifer . " " Did your wife hear about this also ? " I asked politely . Jerry looked enraged . " Who said anything about that bitch ? " " You told me the other day that she was with Cleon Wilsonwhen he met the other guy . " " I was mixed up or something . They were n't together that night . Anyway , she ai n't my wife . I mean , she split . And she was just living there , that 's all . But she 's split now . " " Well , you have anything new to tell me ? " I asked . He glared at me but restrained himself , and said , " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  do n't get me wrong . " He was rolling up the sleeves of his workshirt as he talked , admiring the inside of his huge fleshy , muscled forearm . I saw that he was tattooed . " Brother Cleon is something . The dude knew some bigshots in Hollywood . " " What people in Hollywood ? " " Some big movie guys out at the beach . " I stared at his tattoo . It was a picture of a knife drawn in blue and green ink about ten inches long . It had a straight edge , and the veins of his wrist ran into the blue of the knife . He raised his arm between us and flagrantly admired the knife on his yellowish flesh . " Cleon said his buddy was shook . He killed the Hollywood guy , and that famous dude was running around in his head . " " What else did he say ? "  | " That the dude was a hit man who feels better if he goes out and hurts somebody when he feels down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't remember . " Jerry was staring at his forearm , clenching his fist , pumping up the muscle . I had to try things out on him . " Lyons ? " " Could be , " he said , still watching the knife on his arm . " It does damage , " he said suddenly . " What does ? " " The knife . " He twisted his elbow and raised it to my face . " I want to meet Cleon Wilson , " I said , flinching , but trying to look him square in the eye . " You call me up , " he said . " Did he know Sal Mineo at all ? " Jerry stood up so fast he knocked the table toward me . " Listen , babe , how would he ? " he asked . Somebody came running over to our table . I turned my head and almost bumped my face into a wrinkled suit jacket stretched over a huge stomach . Sergeant Casey grabbed Jerry by the sleeve of his workshirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I catch you talking to her again , and you 're a jailbird . " Jerry ran for the front door . He stopped , looked around the small restaurant , and raised one thick arm . Nobody but me noticedhe was giving us the finger . Casey smirked at me like he remembered a dirty joke about girls and newspapers . " You 'll have to sit still for some questions , " he said . He lowered his girth between the chair and the table . His eyelids were pink , and his pale blue irises were dominated by patches of red veins . His tie was hanging unknotted . He had the tired , sprawled look of an office worker who 'd overeaten at lunch and now wanted more than anything to lie down and sleep it off instead of going back to work . Opposite me , he kept pulling his coat forward to take the strain off the buttons . He moved with fatigue . " What the hell are you doing ? " he asked , in a voice that convicted me of crimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . He shook his head dubiously , and tossed a crumpled pack of Salems on the table.  | " I 'm working , " I said . " Yeah ? " he said . I did n't have much credibility in the work department . " What at ? " " I 'm a reporter , " I said . " I 'm not breaking any law . " " That 's my job , lady . What do you know about the law , anyway ? " " Well , I know about newspapers , " I said . " What about them ? " " They 're protected by the First Amendment , for one thing . " I hate anybody to obstruct my work . The problem was that he saw me as horning in on his territory . " How 'd you find this joint ? " he asked . " Research . " I turned the corners of my lips up in a fake smile . " You probably get paid more for your articles than we get for solving the whole fucking case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you working on any other cases ? " " Yeah , some guy killed a teenage girl . I got called out on it the other night . " He waved a hand at Annie Harmon . She walked over , dragging her feet . Nobody loves cops , even when they 're on your side . " Coffee , very black , " he said . " Banana and yogurt , " I said , " with fudge . " He rubbed his eyes until the red patches spread onto the whites . " Have you had any cases like the Sal Mineo one ? " I asked . " Lady , it 's my job . " " What 's the strangest murder you ever solved ? " I was looking for an opening . I dug into the frozen yogurt . " Nothing under the sun is strange to me , " he said , and he slugged back his coffee . " Have there been gay murders out here ? " I asked . " I did n't say gay , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been gay murders ? " " Well , there was the guy who 'd pick up a trick , kill him , and put him in a plastic bag , all cut up . " " God , " I said . He almost laughed . " The press boys called it a case of ' a fag in the bag ' or ' a flirt in the dirt . ' Unofficially . " I looked at a spoonful of bananas , vanilla yogurt , and fudge sauce , and had a new double sensation . While my taste buds werep206watering over the fudge , my stomach tightened and turned over . I put down my spoon . He was reviving for a moment from the coffee . " Last good case was the Skid Row Slasher . " " He killed bums ? " " Eleven of them . Slashed their throats and then had sexual relations . Then he spread salt all over the place to keep the smell of the blood down . " My stomach did a flip like a beached fish . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had no physical evidence except for a shoeprint in the blood . " " Blood ? " " Yeah , and two drinking glasses filled with blood that he left because somebody surprised him . " He put a long cigarette between his lips and did n't light it . I wished the woman next to me would finish her hamburger because the smell of the onions was killing me . " Yeah , lots of guys that work in packing plants get a taste for blood . That was the guy 's signature , a taste for blood , and we knew it . It made a good story . " " Did somebody write it up ? " I asked , swallowing against the feeling rising from my stomach . " Yeah , I write these penny dreadfuls under a fake name , " he said , and finally lit his bobbing cigarette . " You do ? " " Yeah , I write my cases up for Argosy crime magazine at about a hundred a shot . " He exhaled . No wonder the guy felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I was dying to ask him , but it was his interview . " So , doll , tell me why you were talking to that small-time con artist . " An ash flaked into his coffee cup . " Who ? " " Cleon Wilson . We been staking this place ever since the murderwent down , because this was Mineo 's hangout . Then you show up . We figure it 's one of them flukes . But then Wilson shows . So I get my fat butt over here . Lady , I just sat down to last night 's boiled potato and pork chop . Twelve hours late . It was sunrise , and I had n't hit my bed . But for you , I broke speed records . I drove in from the Valley . "  | " Cleon Wilson ? " I almost blurted out that he claimed his name was Jerry Johnson . But I clamped my mouth shut . It was very interesting . If the guy was in fact Cleon Wilson , he had lots to explain about the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the cops . This was my story . I had a chance to break something ahead of them . Maybe Wilson drove the killer away from the crime and was scared to say so because he 'd be implicated in a murder . Or maybe he was just a lost soul , trying to fantasize himself connected to Mineo . " How do you know his name ? " I asked . Casey coughed out a small , dense smoke ring . It hovered over the salt and pepper shakers . " Identification cards . We booked him . Oh , look , lady , do n't play so dumb , " he said . " I was eating a whole-wheat bagel out there , inhaling car fumes with my face behind the L.A. Times . " He pushed his thumb in the direction of the front porch . " And I 'm warning you , I ai n't nobody 's privateprotection service . Cleon Wilson 's too much for you . And I bet you 're obstructing justice . Maybe you do n't even know it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , he 's small-time and scared . He might do anything to prove he 's important . " " How did you find him to book him ? " I asked . I knew he 'd make a minute or two of conversation that he figured had nothing to do with the case . Maybe he was right . Maybe he was wrong . I knew he would n't tell me anything he thought was really relevant . " We picked Wilson up one night , " he said , " outside Gucci 's on Rodeo , the night after the murder . Some lady and her husbandwere window shopping , tourists from New York . They 'll walk anywhere . " " What about Wilson ? " I asked , while he put out his cigarette in his coffee saucer . It was going to be interesting to find out which name was the real one . " He was holding four dollars in one hand "  --  the cop raised one huge white hand  --  " he had all her credit cards and her driver 's license in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb to drop them . " " He mugged her ? " I had never eaten breakfast with a mugger before.  |p208I  needed to find him again , if only to prove he was a hoax . Jesus , I was frightened . " Did Wilson have a partner ? " I asked . " I think so . But he 's a small-time guy , " the cop said . " Why ? " " He tried to cop a booking by giving us stuff on Mineo , but he fucked it up . " " How ? " I asked . " Lady , what did he tell you ? " Casey asked . " Oh , just something about how he had some information . But he never got to it , " I said , thinking fast . " Well , he did n't tell me , " Casey said . Like him , I did n't reveal anything . If Wilson really knew the murderer , I wanted to find out myself . If he was only a bullshit artist , I 'd handle that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " Read the press release the sheriff 's office gave out . " " Somebody told me something about a yellow car , " I said . I did n't want to say that somebody was Wilson . I wanted to check up on his facts without tipping my hand . " It was in the goddamn L.A. Times . " Casey did n't think much of my reporting skills . " Some neighbor saw a yellow car driving away . " The cop looked at his watch . He heaved himself to his feet and looked down . One shoelace needed to be tied . He was n't going to bother . " Wilson does n't know shit , " he said , " but he 's no playmate for you . " He was fishing in a pocket deep in the folds of his huge pants for some change . " He 's nobody I 'd invite to my debutante party if I was you . " " Wait . " I was asleep at the switch . " Tell me about Chris Franklin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloth . " Nothing to tell . " " Not what I hear , " I said . " Yeah ? " " I hear you pulled him in for a lie detector test . " " I 'll run you out of town in ten minutes . " He was breathing hard.  | " Why ? " " You 're getting in the way of police procedures , and that 's it . Keep away from my job . Do n't obstruct the criminal justice process . You print something and some con man says he ca n't get a fair trial , and that makes more work for me . It ai n't worth it . Correction  --  you ai n't worth it . " " What about Mark Loren ? " I asked . " I heard you 're going to arrest him . " " Nothing doing , " he said , and turned away . " I 'm not choosing your friends , lady , but you got trouble coming at you from six directions . " I put my lips together and smiled , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey knew about debutantes , but I was learning.  |p210I  do n't like getting hurt . The last time I had scabs I was twelve . I kept falling that summer because my dad was teaching me to ride a two-wheel bicycle and my legs grew all at once . In Manhattan I 've never been mugged . But out here that Ivy League guy smacked me back on my haunches at the airport . Jonathan broke my water glass at the bar , and I cut myself . The woman missed my skull and broke my window with a hammer . My shoulder had a green and blue bruise , a map of where she hit me . At the center of it all was Sal Mineo , in a place where people do n't breathe . I pictured his orange makeup flaking like dandruff onto the pink pillow under his head . But at the hotel that afternoon was the worst . The ground melted , a big hole opened under me , and not because of an earthquake either . It started when I pulled the gold bedspread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mexican maid shuffled across the shag carpet on straw sandals with broken heels . She was pulling open the striped curtains to the balcony , and I heard her grunt when the sun hit her eyes . I wondered if she knew people who swung hammers at other people 's heads . The phone rang . I fumbled and almost dropped it when I heard Marty Burns . It was the first time I caught an accent on him , although I tease him about the gold Phi Beta Kappa key from Brooklyn College that he wears on his belt . " That really you ? "  |p211I  laughed . He always talks like he 's chewing on a lemon . This time he had a legitimate gripe . I had n't returned his calls for two days . " I got a wire service report here says you been kidnapped . " That 's his way of saying he 's glad to hear my voice . " Yeah ? Who 'd kidnap me ? " " A sect of religious faggots . They get your brain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I missed it . I could just see him kick his chair back , heave his legs up on the gray metal desk , and plant his heels on top of a pile of old copy . " Not the brain , " I said . " They snatch your body first . " " That 's real funny , " he said . " It explains why you 're not sleeping at the hotel . " " Hold on a minute , " I said . I yanked the curtains shut . The room was dark . I switched on the orange plastic lamp by the bed , then I switched it off . The maid stared at me . " Estd bien ? " I nodded . She padded into the kitchenette . A second later , the room smelled of cleanser . The clerk should have covered for me . I wondered if Marty was mad . I did n't apologize . " You follow up on that Kate Lyons lead ? " I was relieved . " Right , turns out she 's K. R. Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled . " You two gals make friends ? " " The impossible happened , " I said . " She took a dislike to me . " " What 's she like out there ? " " When she enters the room , all you see is this gray fin . " He snorted . " Like I say , you 're funny . How else you been spending my money ? " Then there was a fuzzy sound . He was rubbing his palm over the mouthpiece , but then I heard him say to somebody , " It 's okay . She 's a pro . " " That 's right , " I said . " Listen , I been interviewing a lot of weird people . Why do n't I start with a few profiles ? There 's Sal Mineo 's next-door neighbor . She 's a local character , part of the Hollywood underbelly , used to coach voice on I Love Lucy ' and her father was a stunt rider  --  " He cut in , " Maybe later . " " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a detective . It 's a different world . I could write a whole book  --  "  | " Aahm , Sara , listen  --  the publisher 's here at my desk . He wants some teasers . " It was a compliment . They wanted headlines to tantalize readers about my series . Only I was n't ready . " Marty , buy me some time . " " You got nothing ? " That he should n't be saying in front of the publisher . " Trust me . " He covered the mouthpiece and this time I could n't hear . Then he said , " You 're out of credit . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " I make my own rules about chasing down a story . But maybe the publisher was pressuring him . He sounded guarded . " Sara , you get me any gay mafia names  --  agents , casting directors , stars , producers ? " My stomach tightened up and started to sink down inside my body . I looked down . There were red patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the kind of skin that burns and fades . It rarely tans . But then I do n't work at it . I was rattled . Marty said something , but I did n't hear . I tried to bargain . " I 'll give the copy desk five hundred words on Mineo 's gay activism . " He yawned loud into the telephone . " I heard that , " I said . " Suppose it was n't a sex crime ? " " Suppose the sun does n't set tomorrow ? " " Listen , Marty , I 'm miles ahead of the cops on this one . " I was trying to sound confident , the way he likes . " Nuts , " he said , without changing his tone . " I need Hollywood dirt . " " That 's the obvious slant . " I was stalling . " Wrong . " " How do you know what 's going on in the world ? You do n't leave that office to change clothes . " He keeps clean shirts in his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it was funny . " Wire service . The L.A. County sheriff 's sniffing around every star who ever parked his Mercedes on Sunset Strip . I thought you were going to dig out there . But you just dusted off the old gay rights sermon . Maybe you can sell girl scout cookies . " " But it 's slander . " I promised Mark . I had to be fair.  | " Listen , girl scout , a year from now , two years , if you still care , you 'll write it your way . " " Three more days . " " Nothing doing . " " The police are laying a trap . " I was improvising . " Nuts . Wire service says a Sergeant Casey is stuck . He 'd pin that murder on anybody . I bet they got a tail on you . " " I 'm so close , I 'm in their way . " " Then you can name names . " " Marty , that 's not the story . I got this feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . I 'm on the track . " " I think you got sunstroke . File me five hundred words , and get the suntan oil and the stomach and the brain on an airplane . " My own editor getting in my way . " I 'm too smart for this doubletalk , " I said . " Nobody bosses me around like this . I 'm coming home , all right , but when I finish up the job and not a minute sooner . " I gulped . I had n't planned to say that . The blurred phone static between us made me nervous . I walked around the bed and opened the curtain again . I squinted down at the sun on the cars . I needed a strategy . " Five hundred words or else , " he said , too quietly . I exploded again . " Nothing doing . I 'm getting to the bottom of this . I 'm a big girl now , and I 'll go it alone . " " Before you fall on your sword , big shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write them , but my way . " " Name names . " " No , and Marty , I 'll see you in a week . You ca n't pull me off this story . It 's got my name on it . " " You lost your marbles ? " He was right . I was fighting him like he was an enemy . " Call it vacation , " I bargained . " Without pay , " he said . He covered the mouthpiece again . Then he said , " Mr. Big here wants to know if you fell in love . I told him you ai n't got the right gender for the birds on this job . " " Talk about love , Marty , you 're supposed to love good journalism . "  | " How many times I told you , " he said , " this ai n't no writers ' colony . " I lowered my voice . " I 'll level with you . I got an eye on Chris Franklin , and he 's a prime suspect . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hiding out . A gay murder ca n't help him any . You know he 's the centerfold in Cosmopolitan this month ? " " Nude ? " " Do n't ask me , " he said . " But what about that singer you were eyeing at the funeral  --  Mark Loren ? " " What about him ? " " You tell me , " he said . " No . " " Well , I hear he 's been hiding for four years because he do n't want anybody knowing he 's a faggot . " " That 's not it . " " Oh , no ? Write it your way , then . But I want it five minutes ago . " " I 'll write what I want , " I said . I was bluffing , but I was mad . " Take me off the payroll and you 'll be bidding against every magazine in the country for the story when I 'm finished . " " We 're professionals , " he said . " Think of that hungry son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wild fruit-chase . " " I can get to the bottom of the whole mess , Marty . I can solve the murder . " " Yon and the L.A. police force . " " It 's a shame you ca n't talk without that guy breathing down your neck . " I ca n't stand the publisher . He sighed . " Why 's it so important to you ? " " Think about it , Marty  --  you taught me everything I know about this business . " There was silence in my ear , except for the static . My mind was jumping around . It landed on the Canyon Loan Company . Maybe Sal Mineo needed quick cash . I rubbed my forehead , but I could n't come up with the name on that card that fell out of Mineo 's script at his apartment . Then it hit me . Miss Chasin . Marty was listening to somebody  --  the publisher  --  talking in the background . " Aah , Sara , " Marty said , " if you 're not sittingp215here typing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . We 'll put your stuff downstairs in the society section . " The maid was banging pots and pans in the tiny kitchen . I was stunned . If I threatened him , that was one thing . But he knew I would n't write about parties and engagements . He was firing me . I swallowed hard to keep things in place . " You 're kidding , " I said . " Sorry . " " Marty , I ca n't sit here all day and chat . " I tried to take charge . " I 'm working . You 'll get the five hundred words . " We hung up on each other . It was a draw . I was n't thinking straight . I did give the maid a dollar for taking away the breakfasttray . For some reason , I dug around in my suitcase and pulled out a pair of wool socks . Then I put them on and got under the covers . I was n't fired . That was impossible . Marty was too softhearted to can me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? I felt like I 'd been kicked out of a family . Marty always backed me up . I remember how he nodded sagely when I told him I was moving out on Joe . I remembered the way he flushed when he gave me my birthday bonus . Well , he 'd be proud of me on this thing later . That thought lasted a split second . I knew Marty never fired anybody for insubordination . But the publisher would do it . I 'm glad when he leaves me alone until my stuff is cold newsprint . The publisher strikes anywhere he wants . And I 'd crossed him . I was in trouble . I was on my own , either a crank with a hunch or , worse yet , a freelance writer . That 's a euphemism reportersuse when they 're out of work . The idea exhausted me . I pulled the phone onto my chest and dialed Mark . It beeped busy . I thought of something . I called room service and ordered two cheeseburgers and a Coke for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Post was picking up the food bills . I 'd have to cash a check quick with Jay . I could move to a cheaper hotel , but that would call attention to my diminished status . It had to be my secret . I rubbed my eyes and felt my tear ducts stinging . It was n't fair . I was doing a great job , and nobody understood that . I was never fired from anything . I do things well , with an approvingp216teacher or editor behind me . I was going through hell out here to get the story . Did Marty think I was lounging around some pool ? I made up my mind to do something really tough . Like take off my wool socks and make a phone call . I did n't need the newspaper . It was time I gave up my nursemaid . I called Mark again . Busy . I called room service and added coffee to my order . Two cold cheeseburgers and a watery Coke arrived . No coffee . I avoided the look in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed on the last supper . The roll was stale , and the burger was covered with gummy cheese . I picked off a mealy slice of tomato and some brownish lettuce . It 's funny  --  most people think junk food is uniformly bad . But there 's nothing like a rare , thick , juicy cheeseburger with the meat brown on the outside and toasted American cheese on top . I called Mark again . Still busy . I spit out bits of meat and roll . I paced the room and looked out my balcony . The Strip looked the same . I wondered what would happen if I threw a cheeseburger into the traffic . Instead , I walked into the kitchen , opened a cabinet , and hid it behind some white cups . I got the number of Canyon Loan Company and cleared my throat with an important harrumph when a woman answered . " Miss Chasin , I presume . This is Mrs. Diane Porter . " I made my voice deep . " I 'm handling probate on the Sal Mineo estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . " When she asked , tremulously , I assured her that I was a lawyer . She was dying to talk . " That was a shock . I mean one day he 's in the office , a movie star , and then I see headlines on the way to work . You do n't think it was a crime of passion , do you ? " " That 's none of my business . " I wanted her to shut up and give me the information . " Please tell me the date of your transactions . " " Well , it was about a week ago . " " Do you keep records ? " " I 'll see . " I heard a drawer slam . " He came to see us the day before it happened  --  the murder . " I thanked her but she did n't want to let it go . " Oh , right  --  well , he was so sweet . I 'd hand him the ten thousand dollars onp217charm alone , but everyone says I 'm easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet nobody 'd noticed she was easy in years . " Of course , it 's always Mr. Arnold 's decision , and he wants collateral . " " What collateral did Mr. Mineo offer ? " " Some health-food store his mother runs back East . " " Did he say why he needed money ? " " No , it was a secret . " She paused . I waited and she started to gush . " He was willing to take our high interest rate . So I asked him why . He said it was for a friend in trouble . I think he said something about a fiancee . But he was gay , right ? " My nerves were shot . I raised my voice . " Well , do n't believe everything you read . " She sniffed a little . I guessed she was around fifty and used to enduring bad temper displays , but that did n't excuse me . I asked her to read me the loan application . It was routine  --  name , Californiaaddress , social security number  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd made twenty thousand dollars that year . " Thank you , " I said , and apologized for my nerves . Then I said , " Miss Chasin , what is your first name ? " " Irma , " she said , " You know , first he walks in here , then the murder , then Mark Loren 's on the phone  --  " " Mark Loren ? " I clenched my teeth and belched . This was the final blow to my digestion . " Right . You know , the popular singer the kids are crazy for . " " No . " I could n't believe it . " Well , everybody else knows him , " she said . " He sounded Southern and sad . He told me it was like a death in the family . Said he got my name off a card . " When I hung up , everything bothered me . He kept the card from the screenplay . He lied to me . The hotel room was stifling me . It was hot and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows . They smelled faintly of cologne . I rolled over and looked at the ceiling . I hated the ceiling . The paint job was new , but I could see brush strokes . They had skimped on a second coat . I pulled a pillow over my face . I wished things were different . I closed my eyes and listened to my breath . I was pulling thep218air through my mouth and deep into my chest . I was sweating . There were too many questions , and danger around the edges of things . Mechanically , I got up and pulled some hotel stationery out of the night-table drawer and put in a call to the copy desk . I told them to have somebody ready to take five hundred words in an hour . I called the hotel clerk and asked for a typewriter . He said I could have it by tomorrow . I went to the kitchen sink and threw cold water on my face . Hunched over on the bed , I scraped at the point of a pencil with my thumbnail until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gay Activist : Sal Mineo. "  |p219I  was sick of Los Angeles drivers . The black Mustang in front of me sped through one stop sign and stopped for the next . Without warning , a woman passed me in the left lane . I swung past Greenblatt 's Delicatessen onto Laurel Canyon Boulevard , heading for Mark 's house . When I 'd finally reached him by phone this afternoon , he 'd insisted on going to Kate Lyons ' party too . I never mentioned the loan company and his lying . Up in the hills , I jerked to a stop at every street sign . I punched in radio buttons . There was no news about why somebody had left Sal Mineo bleeding to death in an alley . I snapped off the radio and fumbled through my blazer pocket in the dark for the little Sony . I could n't go on like this . Everybodywas lying to me . I was going to do some interviewing at the party tonight . That Lyons had some explaining to do . Accordingto Mark , Kate and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little fact Kate never mentioned . I wanted to meet her mysterious husband . He was one of the last people to talk to Sal Mineo , or at least that was Nick Ray 's impression . I hesitated at the foot of Mark 's hill . I 'd kept him out of my article . Jerk that I am , I keep my promises . Watching the dark shape of the elevator swing toward me , Ip220felt like the last person in the world . Behind and below me , thousands of city lights twinkled . The wind blew a burnt-coffee smell at me  --  smog . I stepped into the elevator and closed the gate . Three days ago I was a competent reporter . Now I was scared to ask Mark questions  --  why he lied to me about the loan company card , why Mineo needed ten thousand dollars , why Mineo 's " fiancee " had money trouble . Was Chris his fiancee ? Nick Ray said Mineo was at the beach the day he was murdered because Chris was in trouble . Dammit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force Chris to talk about the murder . But he was running scared , and Mark was protecting him from me . I needed Mark 's help , but he had too much power over me . I was twisting my rules . I remembered when a woman reporter was fired from the New York Times for having an affair with a legislator she was covering . The editor said , " I do n't care if you fuck elephants , but then do n't cover the circus . " Inside his house I smelled furniture polish . It was dangerous the way he left the place open . " Mark ? " I called . I felt my way along the walls . The living room glowed in the light from the aquarium . He was collapsed on the leather couch in his big dark bathrobe , staring at the fish . The air smelled of marijuana . Suddenlyhe irritated me . " You do n't look ready for a party , " I said . He rolled on his side , away from me . He seemed mad out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered . " You think you 're ready ? How long you been practicing that dumb slouch ? " I was shocked . " What 's wrong with you ? " I asked . " Really , " he said in a tone of voice that implied the word was answer enough . He was infuriating . I sputtered , " Next time I 'll swish in here like a pretend female . You like that style , right ? " He laughed at me , his voice crackling with misery , and pulled a small glass tube out of the folds of his bathrobe . He tapped it on the side of his wrist and inhaled something into each nostril . He bared his teeth and rubbed the leftover powder from his wrist onto his gums . I wished we were n't fighting . He had a nasty point about my posture . He had such grace . There was something about the way he was presenting himself on the couch in his bathrobe with his collar turned up , as if he 'd framed his face in black velvet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in candlelight , " I blurted out , " but if we both did , who 'd watch ? " He wiped his nose on his sleeve . He knew how to control a sloppy gesture . It made his misery look like tragedy . " Good move , " I said . " You been practicing it in front of the mirror ? " " Sara , go away , go on to your party . Leave me be . " He turned away from me again . As far as I could figure out , he was engulfedin self-pity . I pawed at my pockets for my car keys , and pulled out my hand mirror . " Take a good look . " I tossed it onto his chest . " You 'll feel better . " " Really , " he said again , in that smug tone , and crossed his bare legs . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " I asked . " I love beauty . I love to touch pretty things . You do n't get it . Maybe women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pretty things . Little girls learn that real early . " " But I 'm talking about putting beauty ahead of books , money  --  everything . " I winced . " Yesterday you were telling me how much you love my brain . " He flopped his legs down on the couch . He seemed to have no body tension . " Today I 'm a liar ? " he asked softly . Then he said , " You 're so uptight . You ca n't even get into how you look . Where does it get people like you ? " " It gets us through life with order . We do n't hurt people . Wedo n't take too much . We worry about future generations . " " You hurt people plenty . Divorces and wars are n't great . " " We keep life going . " " Too bad I got this curse , " he said . " What curse ? " " I worship beauty . It 's sexy . " What was he saying ? I was n't pretty enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or could they ? " Really , " he said again . The tone of that word . I could n't believe how mad I was . " So that 's what you inherited from Sal Mineo ? " " Sure thing , " he said , wiping his nose on his sleeve again.  | " I 'll never forget him telling me I was n't the first person he noticed in a room , or the second . But I was the one he never did forget . " " Oh , great . " I was hovering over him , my fists clenched . " Write that down and put it under your pillow . " I stumbled back toward the hallway . " What in hell does that mean ? " he raised his voice . I yelled behind me , " I do n't buy your religion . Beauty is n't everything . It 's superficial . " I felt the front door . When he spoke , he was standing somewherevery near me . " Do n't argue with me anymore . " His voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ? " I shot back . " Really . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Sal said real stuff does n't get said . " He was breathing hard . " You talk to stay away from feeling . " " Yeah ? " I heard myself grunt with rage . " Yeah , " he said . " You come running over here tonight for a free party guide to gawk at sex , cheap thrills , and dopers . You do n't give a flying fuck for my misery . " I do n't remember that ride down to the beach . The ocean looked black . I drove eighty miles an hour along the Coast highway . At the entrance to the Lyons estate , two uniformed guards whirled flashlights in the air . When I switched off the motor I heard the waves pounding . Another car turned onto the path , and headlights swept past a tiny dark-haired woman wearing a white fur coat . The night air was crisp and clear . Yesterday Mark loved my brain , today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shout at him . There was no time . I had to soak up atmosphere and information . A guard wearing sunglasses and a red satin policeman 's hat stuck his head inside my car . He repeated my name into a walkie talkie and waved me to a parking space next to a Rolls Royce . The place was covered with fancy cars . I got out of the Dodge and stretched . I was wearing my oldp223beige wool blazer , and I smoothed down the wrinkles on my gray skirt . I had only packed work clothes . The guard wrote my license number in a large notebook . I started to lock up . " Do n't bother , lady . " He poked his pencil into the hole where my back window had been . " We 're following the guest list tonight . Ca n't find your name , " he told a young man wearing white tie and tails . He slammed his notebook shut and walked back toward the highway . The small woman in the white fur put her hands on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the young man in the tuxedo . She wore her coat open to show sparkles sprinkled across her bare neck and shoulders . She clutched a large black hat under one arm . " I thought you got in anywhere in this town . " " I do . " He took off after the guard . The girl held onto his sleeve with her fist , and teetered on her high-heeled sandals . She cursed when she caught a shoe in the white coat and fell against my car . " I get in anywhere in Boston , " the man said . " This is n't Boston . " The girl dropped his arm . She seemed familiar , even in the dark . I grabbed her hand and shook it . " I saw you at the funeral . " Her hand was too small , fragile , the fingers like tiny bones . She was Nell Fields , and almost as drunk as she was five days ago in the Bronx . Her smile threatened to turn real , and she held onto me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breathy voice turning sultry , " take me in there with you . " " I do n't know . " I was unsure of the guard . " You got to , " she said . She pointed at her friend shouting at the guard along with a small crowd of overdressed people trying to crash the party . " He 's a dud , honey , not like you , " she said . She was having trouble with her s 's . They sounded like sh's. " 1 need to give somebodya message in there real bad . " She pointed one small forefingeracross the gardens toward the house . " I 'll deliver the message , " I offered . " Nope . " " Why not ? " " It 's a secret . " " Okay , okay , " I said.  | " You 're a real one , " she said . " You 're Sal 's type , like me . " She was hustling me . She had an odd voice . It was as though she was n't using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper and seduction , something like Marilyn Monroe . But Monroe had to be Nell Fields 's fantasy . Nell had been a teenage star with Mineo . Back then I wondered how it must feel to kiss your boyfriend in front of movie cameras . I thought they 'd get married when I read that she followed him to a Sioux reservation and did needlepoint while he shot Tonka for Walt Disney . She did n't seem the needlepoint type . Her escort came steaming over to us . " You dump me as soon as a better shot comes along ? " She crunched up her nose . " You bet , sucker . " She put her small hand on mine like a teenager . " I 'm with her . " Something flashed through my mind . She was n't very nice . A moment later , a silver Rolls Royce limousine rolled slowly toward us from the direction of the sea . It stopped and the guard motioned me inside . Nell grabbed my wrist too tight . " Hey , what 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and pulled Nell after me . " I been waiting for her here , " I said . Inside the car , the motor seemed to be far away . The soft leather bucket seats were filled with goose down . The tinted windowsblocked the moonlight and the sound of the surf . We were driving toward the beachhouse very slowly . Nell tipped her small head back against the seat . " Made it . " In profile , her eyelashes looked larger than her button nose . I heard her open and close a compact on her lap . " Who 's giving the party , her or him ? " I asked . " It 's David 's idea . He 's got style . He gives a party every night . These limos , the guards  --  that 's him . " " What 's the party for ? " " Business anniversary . " She turned on a recessed light . I watched her pull a silver flask out of the gold evening bag and swallow several loud gulps . " Brandy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary ? " I asked . " Oh , the Lyons are big producers . They make billions , " she said , and peered out her window.  | " What about your secret message ? " I asked . " You from New York or something ? " she countered . " Yeah . " " Why 'd you make the funeral ? Know Sal from New York ? " Her nose was pressed against the dark gray glass . She was making a spot of mist with her breath . " Did you ? " Her voice was sly . I figured a lot of people had told her a lot of lies in the past fifteen years . " That 's right , " I said . " Where from ? " she asked petulantly . The spot of mist on her window was now almost as big as her face . She did n't want to look at me . " Oh , the old neighborhood . " " Right , the parochial school and the weird nun . " Her voice had respect in it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You know , what's-her-name . " She looked at me for the first time . " Mary Theresa . " " He loved her . " Nell stretched her neck to look out the front of the car at the ocean , a black shining surface that appeared for a few seconds in front of us . " Shit , Sal had such a big fucking heart . " She unscrewed her bottle of gin again , and I realized she was crying . Then she laughed a little deprived laugh . " And he had such a fucking good line . I loved the bullshit parts best of all . " " What was that ? " I asked . " Look , he was my old man . Whenever I needed help , he was there . Sal was my baby . He took care of me from the day I laid eyes on him , like it was his job . Fifteen years we loved each other . " " That sounds like a good friend . " I sounded like a girl scout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and put a tiny fist against her front teeth . I think she hiccupped . " Why ? " She looked at me , and her head wavered from side to side . She was really drunk . " I 'll say it fast . Do n't ask me again . Okay ? " I nodded.  | " Because he did n't always love me that way , but he was my fiance . " " Did he offer to lend you money ? " I said stiffly . The car stopped . She began slapping on the window as a group of people got out of the car in front of us . " There 's Dougie , " she said . " What a terrible haircut . I hear he 's working at Fox . " " Who 's that ? " I asked . " Some stiff , " she said . " What 's that mean ? " She grabbed my wrist again . " Let me tell you how the old man saw it . " Her voice was starlet , breathy again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the straights , they 're the guys who sit in the studios and balance budgets . They 're the bank . They 're steady . They could be running the goddamn Federal Reserve Bank . " " Not these people . " I gestured at the house . " No , no , the Lyons 're independent producers . They do n't answer to anybody . Sal says independents 're like Mafia , only they do n't got honor . That 's a joke , honey . " " Is that guy David Lyons ? " I asked , watching a tall man greeting the group . " David ? " and she shook her head like she remembered somethingfunny . " Sal said he 's the movie queen . He 's so hot to make movies . " Her words slurred , but she kept talking . " It gets him off . He 's Hollywood with spats on . Sal dug him . You hear about his gun thing ? " " No . I do n't know him . " " How 'd you get invited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nell heaved herself up and closed her coat around her tiny body . " Forget her . " " Well , what about his gun thing ? " " Well , he always gets the same clause in his contracts . If one of his pictures makes lotsa money , like forty million , the studio buys him an antique gun . " " They do that ? " " They do anything to keep him happy . " She hiccupped . " He 's so crazy . Sal used to tease him . "  | " What 's that mean ? " " Oh , you know Sal . He could get the straightest stockbroker in the world wondering if he was coming or going . " " So that means David 's straight ? " " People talk too much , " she said , and turned the door handle . Nothing happened . The chauffeur opened the dark glass window between him and us . " Another four minutes , madam . " " Who comes to these parties ? " I asked . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her voice was sweet . " That 's the business , honey , " she said . " Of course these 're the faggots . " I tried to sound worldly . " I thought nobody cared . " " It 's hard for the talent , " she said . " The public does n't buy gay stars kissing ladies . If it gets out , you 're finished . " " Was that Sal Mineo 's problem ? " " No , " she sneered . " Sal did n't need it . He was a director , anyway . He was above it all . " " I thought a lot of actors are gay , " I said . " No  --  fuck no . Anybody who wants their face on a hundred million movie screens loves himself so much . . . " " So much that  --  ? " " That they 'd go down on themselves if they could . " She laughed . " That 's Sal 's joke . " " Did the studio guys like him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an aristocrat , you get me ? He 's old Hollywood , friends with Garland . He did n't have to strut . " " Why not ? " " He had a thing with Jimmy Dean . " The chauffeur released the door lock . She stepped on her ermine with one foot and almost fell out of the car . " Everybody loved him . He was the most outrageous , honey , the most elegant . They might trash him , but they all knew he was some-body . " She walked away , the back of her coat dragging the gravel path . I slammed the car door behind me . The chauffeur had stepped out of the car . " Jesus , wait a minute , " he whined . I followed her , trying to make conversation . " That nun reallyp228loved him . " Her stiletto heels kept sinking into the gravel , but she was running toward the front door of the beach estate . " Sure , sure , she fronted for him when he lifted some money from some place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . She shook my arm off her elbow . At the black marble steps , she straightened her shoulders to face the party . " She took care of him good , " she said . The door opened , and the heated stream of lights and music hit me like a subway train . A harsh , irregular beat thumped in my ears . There must have been a hundred people packed into the hallway in front of me . Nell Fields put one elbow up in front of her small body , pushed between two bare backs , and disappeared without a backward glance . Hot neon rays of pink and turquoise cut across the faces . Pretty kids dressed in what looked to me like their parents ' makeup and scanty clothes . I squeezed in and smelled thick gardenia perfume . I dodged a rhinestone earring the size of a golf ball . Nearly everybody was holding something  --  a glass , a joint , a cigarette . Nobody was looking at anybody else . The girl in the gigantic earrings raised her fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drugged . She started dancing alone . The stones flashed and bounced . With each step she bumped into somebody else . Suddenly I heard three quick explosions . The girl stopped dancing and fell against me . " What 's going on ? " I shouted . The music was pounding . " It 's him again . " There were beads of sweat on her upper lip , and she reached down to her shoe . Her heel was the size of a copy pencil . " He keeps it rnoving . " " That was a gun , " I shouted . " Do n't worry , " she mouthed . " Something 's wrong . " " Him . " She pointed up . I stood on my toes and looked above the heads to an empty staircase . I pushed through the crowd , and almost stepped on a man lying across the stairs , his hands tucked under his head . He tapped my knee , smiling up . " Wait , " he shouted , and pulled some sheets out from underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , his angry look , his backside with tennis shorts ,  |p229and  his legs . I flipped one photograph over . The back explained that he was an actor who wanted to go to Maui and cool out for a month . So he was raffling himself off at twenty-five dollars a ticket to a hundred women . The lucky winner would have him at her mercy for a week . He did n't do faggots , and his " master " could n't take him out of Los Angeles , since he needed all his bread to get to Hawaii . I returned his smile . In a flash of diplomacy , I pointed to the ring finger of my left hand , and shouted , " I 'm married . " At the top of the stairs the hallway carpet felt deep . I heard a man laughing . I opened a thick door and smelled bleach and fresh laundry . It was a huge linen closet filled with enough blankets and sheets to stock a department store . An explosion rang out . I ducked involuntarily inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a plump-faced man beamed at me , his full-toothed smile shining through a heavy black beard . His head was shaved . " Scared you ? C'mere . " He held one hand behind his back . I did n't move . " Hurry up , " he said . He seemed so cheerful that after another paranoid flash , I walked out of the closet , past him , and inside a bedroom . Then I saw he held a long antique gun behind his back . I shrank against an early-American maple highboy . He was wearing a large asbestos glove , and the gun was smoking . " You here alone ? " " No , no , I came with a bunch of friends , " I stammered . He smiled and walked over to the open window . The night sea wind blew the shade and the red velvet curtains at his face . He acted like he had been expecting me . He turned out the lamp , and it took me a minute to adjust to the moonlight . " I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said genially . Then he shut one eye , took aim at something out the beach , and fired his gun . My ears rang and then felt stuffed with cotton . " Hey , could you stop that ? " I asked . The room smelled like burning marshmallows . " Not high yet ? " he asked cheerfully , raising the gun , taking aim , and shooting again.  | " No , and I 'm not crazy either , " I shouted . " Stop it . " The gun made my ears feel useless . He pointed the gun at the floor . " Believe me , the noise is killingme . But that rock-and-roll music they 're playing down there is worse . " " Disco , " I said . " Rock-n-roll , " he corrected me , leaning over to pick up something small and silver off the shag carpet . It was a bullet . When he lifted his head I saw that his eyes were small , the eyelidsvery tight , with no lines , pouches , or circles under them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girth of a fat , middle-aged adult . " You 're a new one , right ? What 's your trick ? " he asked . His manner was wonderful . He sounded like a young Midwestern clergyman , an interested , admiring authority . I could have answered anything . Drugs , sexual preference , cars . But I said , " I 'm a reporter . " He lifted the gun , and the skin on my back and neck contractedwith terror . " Oh , for Chrissake , " he said , and pointed the gun out the window again . " Who put you on the list ? " " Your wife . " He rolled his eyes , and spoke in singsong . " My ex-wife . Ah , the shy Mrs. Lyons , ever unavailable to members of the press . " " What 're you really doing ? " I asked , while he braced a knee against the windowsill and took aim again . " You wo n't believe me , " he said , closing one eye . " Try me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two things . I 'm curating my myth , and I 'm shooting at moonbeams on the ocean . " I shook my head . " It 's dangerous . " " I do n't have to account to you , " he said . " But I have ten guards keeping guests off my beach . It 's private . I own it , a halfmileof it . I own the sea , the wind that blows by , and the rain that falls on it . And I 'm using blanks . I 'm an asshole , but I 'm not a bigtime asshole . " He turned the lamp back on . I sat down on the edge of a fur-covered bed . " What are you working on ? " he asked . He pulled the silver bullet from behind his ear and threw it at me . I retrievedp231it from the white shag carpet . Another souvenir of Hollywood . I put it behind my ear . " A story . " He looked at me expectantly . " You could 've told me sooner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " and you come into my bedroom and make me account for myself . " I asked , " What are you working on ? " " A sixty-million-dollar art movie about the life of Buddha , " he said . " It 's going to raise the spiritual awareness of every man , woman and child in this great country of ours . Imagine what would 've happened if P. T. Barnum decided to save souls . And you ? " he repeated . " What 's your current assignment ? " " Sal Mineo . " I watched him lean the gun against the wall and look me up and down . " Was he your friend ? " I asked . He gave no sign of having heard my question . Instead , he asked , " You one of those righteous Americans who thinks he was killed for his sex life ? " " No , but it 's a wild subculture . " I sounded like an academic asshole . " Sex does n't make people murder . " He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he stared out at the ocean . " You know my biggest power fantasy ? " he asked as though we 'd been discussing the subject for an hour . " No , how could I ? " " You could be polite , " he said , and flashed me a boyish smile . He had a sweet quality . It was the voice , the plumpness , and the young face . " I do n't want to run a studio . I turn down those joy-boys once a week . What I want is to see the whole city of Los Angeles go black when I turn off my bedroom lights at night . You follow me ? " " No . Why not run a studio ? " " A studio head anwers to a board of directors , to the IRS . I answer to nobody . " " Except your wife . " " Wrong . She thinks she 's going to get half because of bullshit divorce laws , but I got lawyers working on it . "  | " Working on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what I mean about the city of Los Angeles ? " he asked . " Not really . " " Well , it 's a joke . I grossed four million dollars last week . That 's what I read on the Variety charts . But I 'm fat , I 'm only going to make fifty more movies , and I 'm still going to die someday . " " Nobody lives forever , " I said . " No shit  --  you got it . " He crooked a finger , urging me to come close . When he smiled , his lower eyelids came up and made his small eyes twinkle at me . " When was the last time you saw Sal Mineo ? " I asked . He averted his head and lowered his beckoning finger . " Fuck you . " He turned his back to me . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . " Oh , nothing . " His voice sounded cheery . " They tell you life 's all about love , money , dying with grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Do n't ask me . " " I did n't , " I said . " I asked about Sal Mineo . " " Huh ? " He was pulling off the asbestos glove and opening a drawer of the old highboy . He put the gun away under some blue undershorts . Then he pulled a plum-colored cowboy hat off the closet shelf and placed it on his head . " Like it ? " He patted the Stetson with his fingertips . " Theatrical . " " You do n't like me much , " he said . " Believe me , worse things happen . Come on , we 're going downstairs . " " Why ? " " Because you 're a good audience . Maybe I 'll get lucky and make the pages of your newspaper . " At the door of the room , he beckoned me again . " Hurry up " Below him , the crowd of heads bobbed under the flashing pink and turquoise lights . The music started abruptly . Cigarette smoke curled up toward us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the day he was killed . "  | " Wrong . " He grabbed the banister with both fat hands . He looked like he might fall on the people packed at the foot of the staircase . The idea got me dizzy . " When did you last see him ? " I asked . I took a few steps down . I wanted to see his expression . " On the day he was buried . " He averted his face . His voice did n't sound so chipper . He sounded old . " Before that ? " " Fuck you , " he repeated dully . " Tell me , " I said . " No . " " Tell me . " We were standing on the same step . " No . " He turned and gave me another twinkly grin . He was trying to mask some terrible feeling . " He was out here at the beach on the morning he was killed , was n't he ? " I said . He looked at me hard . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ? " " I 'm going to tell you , " he said . Somebody shouted his name above the music , and he waved back . " Vermin , " he muttered , and then he said , " I saw him the night before . I woke him up at onethirty . I was having a bad drunk , and he pulled on his trousers and climbed around Griffith Park with me until I relaxed . He was n't shocked by my problem . He faced it down with me . That was Sal . " " But I heard he was out here visiting you that day . " " Who says so ? " " Nick Ray . " " I do n't give two fucks for you or the things you hear . " " Why wo n't you admit he was here with you ? " He was walking away from me , downstairs . He shouted over his shoulder . The music was frantic . " I do n't live out here anymore . I moved to Mulholland a month ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fuck the woman who lives here . " " What 's sex have to do with it ? " " Hey , do n't you know sex for people over seventeen is obsolete ? " he shouted . " They look like shit doing it . " " So you were n't here that day ? " " I was sitting with my ass on my fancy chair in my fancy officep234at Paramount . Ask my secretary . Ask my wife . Well , she might not tell you . " " So Nick Ray was wrong ? " I wanted to prolong the encounter . " Not necessarily , scout . " He raised his voice . " Maybe Sal was out here that morning . This is n't the only house on the beach . I 'd like to find out myself . Maybe he was visiting somebody else . " " Why did n't you get him work ? " I shouted . He took a step back up and looked me in the face . " You 're a stranger , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met in two weeks that could get it together to murder is you . " I felt like he slapped me . " That 's unfair , " I said . " Then let me alone , " he shouted , and disappeared into the crowd at the bottom of the stairs . After a second I could n't see the plum-colored cowboy hat . There was a scratch of needle on plastic record grooves , the music stopped , and lights went on . I heard his voice amplified over the buzz of party-talking . " Out front "  --  he sounded genial again  --  " and I 'm going to show you something special . " For a quarter of an hour , I stood on the steps and watched the people crush through the hallway . I followed them outdoors , and eventually there were about a hundred of us standing on the front lawn , the sea wind whipping at bare arms and clothes and blowing people 's hair on end . Too bad Kate Lyons ' flower beds were getting trampled . Two huge floodlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the sea and the sky and the flowering lawns . In front of the crowd , under lights , was the silver Rolls Royce . Lyons walked out to the Rolls , raised his arms , palms down like a minister , and addressed his guests . A tiny microphone was pinned to his blue shirt-collar . " Hallelujah ! " he shouted . " I will attempt to spit on the steering wheel of a **37;9659;TOOLONG Rolls Royce Silver Cloud , owned by myself . " The crowd began clapping . The sounds were flat against the deep thuds of the ocean . He made a hoarse plugging noise in his throat and spat toward the car . " And having failed manfully at fifty feet , " he shouted , " I 'll try again at thirty , praise the Lord . " A few people clapped again.  | " I did it ! " Lyons screamed , and everybody cheered . " Do n't touch it ! Let it dry ! " Lyons yelled , as one girl started to wipe off the steering wheel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hold this , " he said , and disappeared . I sipped it . Very dry champagne . I followed a television actor with blond streaky hair into the house . His name was on the tip of my tongue  --  Roger somebody . He wore gold lizard boots . He positioned himself in a corner of the living room that faced the sea , turned , and smiled like he knew me . I smiled , but there was no further response . I glanced over my shoulder and saw a large projection screen . That was what he was smiling at . On the screen , I saw a closeup of Lyons spitting , and a fast zoom into the steering wheel of a Rolls Royce . A servant offered me a huge bowl of grapes . Roger was chewingon one , his eyes glued to the movie screen . " Who did the film ? " I asked . " Spielberg or Scorsese , " he said . " Home movies . Last year 's anniversary party . " He tossed his hair at me and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to me . It occurred to me that if Mark was at my side , everybody would stare . I 'm not Hollywood beautiful . I could n't imagine anybody looking at me instead of a buttercup like Nell Fields . Her looks were professional . I swallowed more fizzy liquid . I hated to think of the cops bothering Mark again . I was an insensitive clod . He was lurching from one feeling to another , grieving , and scared out of his mind . That was why he hid the loan company card . It had to do with Chris ; Mark just wanted to protect him . Dammit , it was confusing . What am I doing getting involved in it ? My eyes smarted , and I swayed a little while another waiter refilled my glass . It was ridiculous to feel so much . Lovemaking with him was incredible , but it had n't been normallast time , all tongues and fingers . Maybe he really hated women . But then why make love so tenderly ? I held the glass high and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a grip on myself and find a bathroom . A tickle flickered inside me . At the bathroom I joined a line of kids . Three people emerged and another three disappeared inside . I was getting uncom/fortable . The girl in front of me confided , " My nose is going , you know ? I should n't be here . My shrink says rub it on my gums , a bigger surface . " " But that way takes too long , " said a guy . The girl said , " This director I met at the Mark Taper does it with suppositories . It 's fast , but your ass gets ice cold . " I was getting uncomfortable , and this line was n't moving . I decided to give up on this bathroom . I put my head down and tried to make my way through a knot of women crowded around someone with a mustache who was wearing aviator glasses . I tried to get a better look . Then his mouth curved into the world 's jauntiest smile since Gable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers materials , cut tight . Unbuttoned , it hugged his chest . He held a hacking jacket on a hooked finger at his shoulder . I edged down a hallway to another line of people waiting for a bathroom under pink neon lights . Somebody was pounding on the bathroom door . I recognized Kate Lyons . Her eyelids were striped with turquoise lines and she was wearing a transparent gauzy caftan . With her opaque eyes , she looked Egyptian and menacing . Standing a foot from her and swaying in her high heels was Nell Fields . Kate turned to glare at Nell . They both looked angry . I stepped closer . " Gate-crashing is tacky , " Kate was saying . " He wants to talk , " Nell said in a slurry voice . " Talk is free . " Kate pounded the door again . " My house , myjohn , " she shouted . A minute later , a man ran out past her . Nell clutched her evening bag with two hands under her chin . Kate grabbed her elbow and shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom door . I stood there adding it up . Not only had I missed a chance at the bathroom , but I could n't hear them at all . It sounded to me like Nell was the intermediary for someone who had big problems with Kate Lyons . I silently bet all the cash in my wallet that those two ladies were leaning over the bathroom sink to argue about Sal Mineo . I ignored the line of people and blatantly pressed my ear against the door . " They 'll be a while , honey , " a girl said , handing me a joint . " Try the guesthouse . Out the front door and down on the beach . " I did n't move , but I inhaled the joint . It burned my throat.  |p237I  reached into my blazer pocket and pressed a button on my tape recorder . I pulled out a pencil and dropped it to the floor . I smiled a little apologetically , stooped down , and shoved the tape recorder partway under the door . Stooped against the doorknob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it another thirty seconds , then I pulled the recorder out with two fingers . I straightened up just as the door opened , Kate Lyons leading the way . I clutched Nell 's wrist . " What 's it all about ? " " Do n't ask me , honey . " She twisted away from my grasp . Kate Lyons was whispering something to the tuxedoed servant carrying the champagne . She ignored me and disappeared into the crowd . I headed through the mass of party guests for the front door . I walked around the back and took the steps down to the beach . The fresh air smelled like iodine and seaweed . Facing the waves , I realized I was drunk and stoned . A great reporter . Dark , thick clouds passed in front of the moon . I blinked and the gray ocean became bright blue . The sky was dense , hanging above me like gray absorbent cotton . I wondered what kept the ocean in place . I could n't remember why oceans did n't urge up , destroy beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pebbles hit my head and shoulders . Somebody was throwing rocks near me . I heard them on all sides . Something stung my lip , and I whirled around . I held my breath and tried to blot out the noisy surf . The thumps were loud . A rock hit my bare arm . " Stop it , " I shouted at the seething ocean . Another rock hit my neck and scratched a hole in my skin . Somebody did n't mean me well . I saw a dark , square shape nestled under a small cliff . The beach cottage . I shouted , " Anybody there ? " The heavy thumps stopped . I ran blindly toward the beachhouse . My skirt stuck to something , and I tripped and fell backwardon the sand , screaming a thin scream . I pulled cactus needles from my legs . Then , ten feet away , a door swung open and I saw the dim interior light of the beach cottage . " What 's wrong ? " a young voice asked . " I 'm lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , the doorway was empty . Inside the foyer I locked the front door . Nobody was going to sneak up on me . My fingers ached from holding the champagne glass so tight . My thighs were tense from having to pee . I smelled marijuana smoke and cedar wood . The foyer was dim . A door was half open down a hall . Inside it , I saw a candle flickering on tile . A smell of burning incense wafted through . It was a bathroom . I relaxed ; it reminded me of parties in college . But the bathroom was n't empty . I saw a mustached guy with his blue jeans down around his ankles , facing someone on her knees . It was a girl , whose back was toward me . I saw her mouth move away from his groin . In his right palm , he balanced a large round mirror . The girl snorted up some cocaine off the surface of the mirror , and I saw him rub flakes of cocaine on the tip of his erect cock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled but unable to face the dark beach again . I heard giggles . I switched on a lamp and saw three boys and two girls wrapped around each other on a sofa . They grimaced and put their hands over their eyes . I turned the lamp off . " What 's going on ? " one sweet voice asked . " That question 's been on my mind all night , " I said . " Do n't go barging into the john , " she admonished . " He 's got enough coke to go around . " " Is n't there another bathroom ? " I asked . " No , and for Chrissake , this is a line . " There were a few soft murmurs of assent . My throat closed up and I felt sick . I ran for the front door and galloped up over the path near the cactus hedge . I closed my eyes and jumped the hedge . It scratched my calves . My heels kept sinking into the sand . The beach was empty . The wind was cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing and shouting at black servants who were positioning two chrome jukeboxes and a pool table in the sand . Two of them held tall street gaslamps . She hopped around in her billowing white caftan and swore at the sweating servants . I was tired of the hustling , the drugs , all of it . I leaned against a jukebox across from her.  |p239One  of the long gaslamps started to fall over . " Watch it , " she cried , " assholes wo n't take any responsibility . " I grabbed the lamp and propped it up . " What do you want ? " she snapped . " You do n't know what you want . " She was wrong . I wanted this story . I clutched the metal pole . " Tell me about your fight with Chris Franklin , " I said . She stopped moving around in the night wind and put her sunglasseson . They were prescription , opaque mirror . I hated them . My front teeth were knocking against each other in spasms . " I 've heard his version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are you saying ? " " Obviously he wants the deal straightened out . " I made my words vague , filled with hidden meaning . " We got no deal . " " That 's not what Sal Mineo thought . " I suddenly realized Mineo was a mystery element . He could be evoked like God or the germ theory to hint at another reality . " Sal did n't know what he was talking about . " But it 'd worked . There was something between her and Chris . A deal , a pact . " That got him in trouble . " " Wrong . " " Right , " I said . We sounded fairly amiable , like two former schoolchums . " I heard that from Nell , you know . " Kate sneered and barked a laugh . " Nell Field is a fag-hag cokehead . She has n't been anybody for ten years . She 'll do anybodyerrands for a little cocaine . Sal kept her around ; he dug the men she hangs out with . Sal dies and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I thought you said you did n't know Sal Mineo . " " The things you hear about people you do n't give a shit about , " she said . " She do errands for you ? " One look at her face and I knew I 'd blundered onto something . Whatever we were talking about bothered her like crazy . " Get out of here , " she said , " and never come back . " I stepped back , and the long pole I was holding began to sway toward the ground . It fell behind me on the sand , and I heardp240the glass top break as though a wave had tossed it up on the beach . " What going on ? " another voice asked from the steps . It was her husband , his head chalky white in the moonlight . " She 's trying to smear me , " Kate said , " for her tabloid . " " Really ? How ? " David asked . " I find it hard to believe youwould n't fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal with her for Chris ? " I asked . " What about it ? " He looked hard , angry . " She dumped Chris , " I said . " What the fuck is she talking about ? Kate , answer me . " " She 's way off . " " Madam , lady of the press , " he yawned , " it seems you must go . " " Well , about the cocaine  --  " I said . He interrupted . " Cocaine is a banal subject . I loathe it . " He took my arm as though we were moving in a receiving line and began steering me up the stairs and around the house to a Rolls Royce . I smelled shampoo on his beard . He reminded me of a reporter at the office who showers three times a day and complainshe feels dirty . " Cocaine obliterates conscience . I hate it . Selling it . Using it . Work is the only decent thing we do out here . I believe in it , the way you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paused and kissed me on the cheek . " Work , " I said . " No , let me think . " He opened the back door of the silver car . " I believe in work the way you believe the sun will rise tomor-row . " " That 's David Hume , " I said . " I do n't believe him , " he said quickly . " I just believe in work . Once in a while I do n't even believe in that . " He pushed me politely into the interior of his car and leaned down to close the door . He stuck his hand inside the car window . I realized with a shock that I still had n't gone to the bathroom . I looked into his small-child eyes . " Your wife does n't agree with you . " " But she does . " I heard the cold voice again . " She does n't tell you the truth . "  | " What truth ? " He could n't help it . " That Sal Mineo knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I think it was your wife he was visiting that last day at the beach , " I said . I smoothed my hair and felt something jammed behind one ear . I handed his silver bullet back to him . He dropped it on the sand . " Go to hell , " he said , and stepped back from the car . Kate stood behind him . She took his arm . He pulled away from her grasp . The driver steered the car slowly away from the couple . I knocked on the glass window between us . " Hurry up ! " I said . But something had paid off . I punched a button of the tape recorder . After a scraping noise and silence , I heard Nell crying over some music . Water was running . " Sal went to the limit for Chris . What 's in it for you ? " It was Kate . I could barely make out her words over the party noises . Nell answered , " Shut up . I know what Sal thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped.  |p242The  air down here was awful , pure gasoline and exhaust . I blinked against the fluorescent ceiling light , but it did n't get me any answers . I was parked in the garage under my hotel , too tired to switch the lights off . I put the Dodge in gear and drove out again past the dozing night-guard and onto Sunset where a teenage hooker was sitting on a newspaper stand brushing her hair . I needed to talk to Mark . If any living human being knew Mineo 's intimate problems , he did . I had to get Mark to trust me . Clearly , Nell Fields had crashed the party to offer Kate Lyons an olive branch from Chris . I sketched out a rough history ; somehowSal Mineo got Kate Lyons to dangle a juicy role at Chris . Maybe she even advanced him money . I wondered why Sal did n't go to her husband . It was probably her project . But Chris and Mineo fought , and Mineo got murdered . Kate backed out of the deal because she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mineo . Chris needs to get back into her good graces in order to work . But she wo n't see him . Why ? Kate must suspect him of murder . I had to talk to Chris soon . He had a lot of explaining to do . I turned into Mark 's clearing and I smelled camellia and lilacblossoms . There were no cars except his old Cadillac . Mark figuredin the history . I sighed aloud . Somebody , maybe the mur/derer , ransacked this house twice , looking for  --  evidence , money , Chris , drugs . I had questions for Mark about Sal Mineo 's loan application . I wondered if Chris needed the ten thousand dollars to pay back Kate Lyons . I got out of my car , yawned against the cold , and futilely locked the doors . I rang for the cable car and saw a flash of yelloweyes . A fat cat squeezed out from under the bumper of Mark 's Cadillac . I reached down to pet it , and watched the cable car descend . In front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hill . I imagined another scenario . Chris and Jonathan both had sexual motives to murder Sal Mineo  --  jealousy . The police were hot on this trail . Something at the back of my brain lurched forward . At the bar Mark told me Jonathan and Mineo had a date the night of the murder . He called Jonathan a trick , implyinghe was one of many . And Mark lied to Chris when he said he never met Jonathan . That made me wonder . Suppose Chris , when he came out here , got jealous because his lover was n't keeping promises . Nick Ray had opined that their relationship worked because of the distance between them . A minute later , I stepped out of the cable car and faced the silent adobe walls . I knocked at the door . It was n't locked ; it opened when I pushed . It was too quiet . The house was wide open . I did n't like it . Either Mark knew enough not to fear the people who broke into his house , or he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I bolted the front door behind me . The house smelled of cigarettes and marijuana . I ran down the front hallway and through the living room , my sandals clattering on wood floors . The fish swam peacefully . They 're lucky . Nothing short of war outside the tank disturbs them . Mark had n't turned the aquarium lights off . That was odd . Then I felt a vibration on the floor . I heard someone sweeping a snare with a metal brush , and I held my breath when he started singing . And there 's nothing I can say , When death runs your life , When you 're roamin ' through L.A.p244He teased out a blues melody and stopped it with a percussive snap . I followed the sound through doors and down new hallways . Despite all my problems with Mark , I loved hearing him . The melody sounded more tired than the legendary Mark Loren . I heard him jump an octave and shriek at the top of his range . A great whoop in the middle of the mournful song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a church choir . He crooned in falsetto , " There 's something so deep about the blues , the world ca n't stand it . " Then the tune went awry and I heard him picking it on a guitar . My mind switched tracks . Here I was listening to a major American singer . I was hearing something that had n't been put on a record for the last four years . But then there was silence , and then a crash . I found my way to a door behind the kitchen , still thinking about his career . Last spring there were rumors Mark was joiningBob Dylan 's road show . Before the concert , a full-page statementwelcoming him back appeared in the Sunday New York Times , signed by music critics . He never showed . Rumors of his death sold out an issue of Rolling Stone in a day . He was a pop culture mystery . I peeked inside the room at a baby grand piano , a set of drums , and an entire wall of control boxes that looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cello , his ear to the instrument 's body . A guitar lay splintered against a wall . Obviously he 'd thrown it . His special glow was gone . His shirt was wrinkled and unbuttoned , and his eyes looked red from cigarette smoke and lack of sleep . His hair hung down over his forehead in limp clumps . He looked like an ordinary tired guy in his early twenties . I felt a pang of disappointment . I wanted him to look like a star . But still Mark seemed magnetic . He slowly pulled the bow across the strings , playing a series of Bach chords . Then he changed it to a deep moaning that reminded me of blues . I saw that he 'd electrified the instrument . The notes went on and on . I wanted to kiss him but did n't dare . I flopped down on a bedp245covered with an antique American quilt . He did n't look up . It was after three A.M. and I did n't want to fight anymore . My questions could wait . I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was his vulnerability and the way he was always fighting to overcome it . Up behind him , a mobile twisted slowly . It was a fragile branch that held a seashell and a crystal . The branch turned in one direction , stopped , and turned back . I felt a little stirring of wind from the open glass doors . He started plucking the cello strings and twisting pegs . " What 's the tune ? " I finally asked . " Something I 'm working on . " " What 's it called ? " " Roaming Through L.A. ' , " he said , looking down at the floor between his knees . I knew what he was doing with that song . It was a slow-tempo Mississippi blues , F minor . " I could play chords for you . " " Forget it , babe , " he said . " Look , " I said , " it 's easy . " Then I heard a tapping . " What 's that noise ? " I asked . He put the cello down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I followed and pressed my nose against the glass , trying to see into the dark night . I made out a tiny bird with a long beak diving into the glass like an electric drill . " That damn bird , " Mark said . " I try pretty near everything . He wo n't give up . I leave him peaches , dates , and nuts . All the wants is to break through that glass and get inside my house . " The bird 's rhythm was steady . " He could fly in through an open window , " I said . " He does n't like open windows . " " Why does n't he work on trees ? " " I reckon he wants to get himself a home inside this magic invisible tree . " " Mixed up , " I said . Mark tried to brush his hair off his eyes . " Maybe not , " he said . " In some parts of town , trees are obsolete , and woodpeckers'llbe obsolete in a hundred years . Maybe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger against the windowpane . I leaned against his side , but he walked back to the piano , andp246started whipping up and down octaves of scales . I sprawled out on the bed , closed my eyes , and pulled the quilt over my bare calves . I heard him walk over and switch off the lamp shining in my eyes . " Thanks , " I said . He picked the cello off its side and began tuning the strings again . Then he began singing : Word I was in the house alone , word I was in my life alone .. . I recognized Robert Frost and shot a look at him . " Shit , " he said . " This is a mess of sheep dung . " It made my eyes sting when he sang his feelings . He stopped picking the melody . " One time , I used to sing my tunes because I wanted to get people going , make them cry about things that made me sad . " " What about now ? " I asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed earphones to one ear . " If it was n't for record-company hype , I 'd just be somebody who 'd written a few tunes . " " I can help , " I said . Then I pushed off the quilt and walked over to the baby grand piano . I sat down , adjusted the round piano stool , flexed my fingers over the Steinway keyboard , and hummed .

I could n't make the long notes cry the way he did , but the music sounded pretty . I had forgotten how much I liked piano . I played his chord progressions through twice , until he came in picking out the melody on the cello . Then he put down the cello .

He slowed me up . I gave it more juice , and ended it . In the silence I leaned one elbow on the piano keyboard and made funny notes . I felt sad . " Tired ? " he asked . He hugged me from behind , pulling me against him . " I know what you 're feeling , " he whispered . I leaned back against his body . He was trying to end the fight . I do n't think people ever really make up . They just get used to the ways they disappoint each other . " You hate my slouch ? " I asked . He buried his face in my hair . " It sure felt like I did , " he said , and leaned his elbows back onto the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it seemed like he could n't make a graceless move .

At final splashdown , there would be no fuel , no food , no oxygen , no nothing , just three men in a capsule with an ablative front all burned off . Total residual weight , not more than 11,000 pounds . Jesus ! ' one of the Langley men said . It could be done . ' They spent the next hour checking the data , and at 0400 in the morning , when Altair was climbing above the eastern horizon to inspect the workmen in the porch , Mott agreed : It could be done . ' He hurried back to Langley to meet with this man Houbolt , who seemed the typical specialist whose ideas were being rebuffed by his superiors . Thanks a million for coming , Mott . The others simply will not listen when I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the scientific community of this nation will not listen to reason . . . They wo n't even look at the comparisons . ' Mott talked with him for two days , reviewing in detail his excellent data and diagrams , and came away convinced that whereas Wernher von Braun 's Earth-orbit rendezvous was workable , lunar rendezvous was far superior , and he began quietly to campaign for it . His advocacy had to be muted because he had already been rebuked for having butted in on the astronaut-versus-machine argument , and he was not sure he could survive another head-on collision with the Senate committee ; indeed , there was reason to think that it might have been Von Braun who alerted Senator Grant to the earlier subversion being practiced by Mott and Kolff . So Mott had to move gingerly , but now he found an unexpected and extremely powerful ally : Lyndon Johnson , in a series of maneuvers so complicated that none could follow , charmed Texas millionaires into ceding land near Houston to a university , which in turn offered it to NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center , and with a chain of forceddraftstudies which supported the Houston location , Johnson persuaded NASA to locate its Manned Spacecraft Center there and to staff it with most of the brilliant men from Langley . Thus Lyndon Johnson 's Texas center became the arch rival of Von Braun 's Alabama center , and the war was on . If Alabama backed EOR , Texas had to back LOR , and Mott found himself automatically allied with the flamboyant Texans against his original German allies in Huntsville . It was a fight which continued for almost a year , with politics , finances , regional pride , fundamental ideas and the great drives of the space age intermingled , and in the end a stalemate existed between Earth orbit and lunar orbit . Senators Glancey and Grant became so uneasy with the impasse that they summoned Mott to testify before their committee , but he was so involved with the fighting that he asked to be excused , and they agreed that he should be saved for a rescue operation . Mrs. Pope did schedule hearings at which Alabama pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate ended , without conclusions , she telephoned Mott to appear before her two senators in the morning . He drove through the night from an inspection he had been conducting at MIT and appeared before the senators bleary-eyed . Once more their words were harsh : We 've got to have a decision before the end of the month . See if you can knock heads . ' He asked them which mode of landing they preferred , and Grant snapped : We have no knowledge . All we have are the bills to pay . ' Mott flew first to Texas , where a colossal space center was rising from marshland , and he had to admit : If you 're going to do it , this is the way . Presto-changeo ! Let there be a space center ! ' He found the Texans adamant in believing that the Langley alternative was the only practical one : Fly it high , throw everything away , orbit around the Moon and take minimum gear down to the surface , even less when you leave the Moon . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to be , and it was an elegant solution . As a one-time engineer , Mott loved that word elegant , for it implied an entire scale of values : an elegant solution had to be simpler than its adversaries , it had to be easily assembled , it had to be cost-efficient , and it had to be instinctively satisfying to the engineering mind . Lunar rendezvous was elegant . But it had to be sold to Alabama , which would be providing the rocketry , and when Mott reached Huntsville he sensed immediately that the Germans felt he was about to betray them . He had mournful meetings with Von Braun and Kolff and long-drawn-out sessions with the lesser engineers , who tried unsuccessfully to drive him into corners . When he talked with Kolff he found no concession whatever ; a year ago the square-faced little man had placed his entire career and reputation on the line in favor of the Jules Verne Approach , and when his beloved big rockets were shot down , he transferred his loyalty to Von Braun , defending his leader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this he refused to do . He asked Mott to dine with him on Monte Sano , and again Stanley met with Liesl and Magnus , who was preparing to play Telemann 's Concerto in D for Trumpet with an Alabama-Tennessee orchestra . The solo part , you understand , ' Mrs. Kolff said . Five cities . He will travel in a bus and see places Dieter and I have never seen . ' He 's very young for such an assignment , ' Mott said . He 's been playing since he was four , ' Dieter said . A great tribute to America . You gave him the instrument , and the instruction . ' After supper the parents persuaded their son to play the cadenza from the first movement of the concerto , and the stocky lad stood with his feet slightly apart , his head high , and played the limpid , rippling music , displaying his skill at triple-tonguing and sustaining a long series of sweet , rounded notes . When he finished , he bowed and went upstairs to study.  |p302But  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they wanted to talk with him about the great decisions soon to be made , and to his surprise Liesel joined him and Dieter when the chairs were placed on the porch so that the stars of summer could be seen . She said nothing , but she did listen intently . KOLFF : I must talk frankly with you , Stanley . MOTT : Not about manned flights . That 's settled . KOLFF : Agreed . I know when my team has lost . MOTT : And not about the Moon as target . We 're going there , and nothing can stop us . KOLFF : Agreed . I tried to talk sense with you and failed . MOTT : ( with slight impatience ) : So what is it ? KOLFF : A problem with the most serious repercussions . ( He spoke alternatelyin German and English , using simple words in the latter language , complex ones in the former , but he betrayed no preference , switching from one to the other in a lively flow of ideas . ) MOTT : Our decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is , and this time you must listen , Stanley . I beg you , I pray you not to commit NASA to lunar-orbit rendezvous . MOTT : You astonish me . Lunar orbit 's a marvelous solution . KOLFF : Yes , but to a problem not worth solving . MOTT : It 'll land us on the Moon . And get us off . KOLFF : It 's a one-time spectacular . It 's a brilliant accomplishment with no constructive follow-on . MOTT : With this technique we can go anywhere . KOLFF : No , no , Stanley ! It will carry you only to the Moon . And then its utility is dead . . . vanished . . . a costly dream wasted and down the drain . MOTT ( soberly ) : What do you see as the error , Dieter ? KOLFF : Von Braun 's solution of Earth-orbit rendezvous is infinitely superior because it gets you to the Moon almost as efficiently , but in addition , it erects a platform from which all the universe can be explored later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We can do it from Earth rendezvous a hundred miles up , maybe three hundred , no more . Do we want to explore Mars and Venus ? We 'll start from our space platform in Earth rendezvous . Mine the asteroids ? Put great telescopes in space ? Establish settlements on the Moon ? All these things can be done if we start with a solid space platform constructed in Earth orbit . Your way we can do none of them . MOTT : And we may refuse to do them all . KOLFF : The sweep of history will not allow us to refuse . We must do each one . MOTT : And if we do refuse ? KOLFF : If we prove irresponsible , other nations will carry on  --  Japan ... India . . . France . . . and always Russia.  |p303MOTT  : Are you badgering me because Von Braun asked you to ? KOLFF : Do you know the phrase sub specie aeternitatis ? Under the eye of eternity ? I am neither for Wernher nor against him . I only want this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if eternity was watching over my shoulder . MOTT : I 'm afraid the decision 's gone against you , Dieter . We 're going to choose lunar rendezvous . KOLFF : Then I shall have to oppose you . I 'll support Von Braun as vigorously as possible . Because I want to prevent you from making a tragic error . . . from selling out cheaply when you know better . Something I never thought you would do . But Dieter Kolff and the other Germans he enlisted in his crusade , men determined to go down fighting on this clearly perceived moral principle , received a staggering shock when Von Braun convened a meeting of the entire Alabama team and announced without emotion that at last he appreciatedthe reasoning of the men in Texas and was joining them . He said that his Alabama plan of Earth-orbit rendezvous was dead and that everyoneshould now rally behind the Texas lunar-orbit rendezvous and make it work . Some of the Germans gasped when the announcement was made and a few challenged him to state his reasons , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mott to explain how the Texas-Alabama cooperation would work : It could be seen , I suppose , as a crass political surrender to the might of Texas and Lyndon Johnson , but that would be only partially true . It 's also the scientifically right choice . And there 's a third aspect which may override both the first and second . By doing it this way , we ensure all the major bases , and Cape Canaveral , of equally importantassignments . We 'll break the instrument down into seven or eight parts . Huntsville will take responsibility for a couple , California for two or three , Mississippi for one , and Houston for its two , plus the astronaut program itself . ' And how , ' asked a practiced engineer , can we possibly fit together seven parts made in seven or eight different shops ? ' By precision , ' Mott said , and he started to explain how the specificationsof each part would be so exactly drawn that it would abut against its neighbors below and above with tolerances of a thousandth of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kolff , infuriated by what he held to be a wrong decision , had risen to his feet , red of face , ready to blast the program while members of the press were in the room taking notes . He must be forestalled . And our good friend Dieter Kolff , ' Mott said blandly , will at last be able to build his monster rocket which will carry us to outer space . ' The Germans working under Kolff cheered , but Dieter , aware of the trick that had been used to silence him , glared and sat down . He and Mott would not speak to each other for seven years.  |p304It  was said previously that President Eisenhower , never an advocate of wasting money in space and almost an enemy of the program , made a series of crucial decisions and made them right . The first was when he placed the program in civilian hands and then protected it from military encroachment . His second may have been even more determinative , for when he learned that the fledgling NASA was about to broadcast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a salary of $8,330 a year and a rating of GS-iz , he hit the roof , warning the administrators that such a blanket solicitation would bring crazies out of the woodwork , or as one jaundiced observer phrased it : We 'll be deluged by all the matadors , scuba divers , hot-rod racers , hopheads , **35;9732;TOOLONG and half a dozen women who will demand that the Supreme Court enforce their right to fly . ' Eisenhower stopped such nonsense in a hurry . Summoning the NASA command , he said bluntly , The men we need for this job are already in our armed forces . Our test pilots . They 've been doing work like this for years and they 'll jump at the chance . ' By that simple device he ensured that the first seven astronauts would be competent , disciplined types who would never embarrass the nation . Besides , as a military man , he knew he could hire the best Navy captains and Air Force colonels for $56o a month plus a few perquisites here and there . ' Commander John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulagi off the coast of Asia , supervising intelligence flights over trouble spots like Korea and Vietnam when the first BuPers announcement was posted inviting any Navy fliers with test-pilot experience to volunteer for the pool from which a small group of men would be chosen for astronaut training . Since he was happy with his job , evaluating it correctly as an essential step to any position of high command , he could express no interest in this new career possibility , but he did notice that had he wanted to get back to that kind of work , he would have been eligible : Two years experience as test pilot in at least twenty major types of aircraft , not over forty years of age as of 31 December , not over 5 feet ii inches , not over r77 pounds , ' He was vaguely pleased to see that he would have qualified on every point , and then he forgot the whole affair . But in April 1959 , when he became aware of the furor caused by the presentation of the first seven astronauts to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test-pilot friends were in the group , and for two days he moved about the Tulagi , telling anyone who would listen , Hey , I know these guys . Al Shepard and Scott Carpenter were with me at Pax River . Great guys . I flew with John Glenn in Korea , him in daylight , me at night . At Edwards they told me this guy Slayton was a hotshot . ' From a distance he followed the press releases about the Sacred Seven , as an irreverent Navy pilot called them , and read with interest and a littlep305envy the splendid stories Life ran about them and their wives . When the first Mercury shots took off with monkeys as passengers , this same Navy pilot took to calling the overpublicized astronauts Spam in a Can , ' an allusion to the fact that they would be not aviators in the old sense but passive cargo in an intricate machine controlled by computers and groundbaseddirectors . Pope did not share this contempt . He argued that in the first stages of any new development the mechanics took priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , and they 'll take over . I know those characters . They 're take-charge guys . ' And he assumed that they would be quickly leaving the Earth on their historic missions , but he had grossly miscalculatedthe difficulties the American program would encounter . He was aboard the Tulagi that day in April 1961 when the Russian Yuri Gagarin made man 's first flight into space , and was depressed for several weeks by what he held to be a personal defeat : Where were our Navy men ? Why were n't they up there first ? ' And his disappointments were not alleviatedwhen Alan Shepard finally made what Pope had to describe as a pathetic counter-gesture , ' and after the details were made available he wrote a discouraged letter to his wife : Do n't let your senators go around making speeches about the glorioustriumph of our space program . Shepard 's flight was like a child 's sparkler when compared to Yuri Gagarin 's meteor . Shepard rose 116 miles in the air , Gagarin 203 . Shepard was in the air 15 minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 . Shepard was weightless five minutes , Gagarin , 89 minutes . Tell your men to get busy . John Glenn 's real flight into space , a three-orbit triumph , excited Pope enormously , and he began a collection of major stories about the astronaut and his reception in various nations . He learned the name of Glenn 's wife and the fact that she had a slight stammer which she bravely overcame , proving that the wives of the astronauts have just as much courage as their husbands . ' And he began to think seriously of volunteering for the astronaut corps when the next group was chosen from the military test pilots . But when the announcement was posted on the bulletin board at Jacksonville , where he was checking new planes to assure that they could land easily on the carriers stationed off the coast of Florida , he was forestalled from submitting his name by Admiral Crane , commander of the district , who gave him a sharply pointed fatherly talk : Pope , avoid this temptation . It looks enticing  --  to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we can be proud of our Navy men . They 've done a better job than any of the others . You know , of course , that John Glenn 's a Marine.  |p306But  I assure you that every one of these men who leaves the service , Navy or Air Force or Army , will be surrendering his career in the service , whether he thinks he is or not . He 'll have the glamour for a while , the excitement of parades , but when he wants to come back and help run the Navy , he 'll find the doors quietly closing against him . The great job of running one of the nation 's armed services will be denied him . Pope , it 's well known in the Navy , and I 'm sure you 've suspected it , but you stand high in everyone 's opinion . We have no position to which you ca n't aspire . You saw my last fitness report on you . The next one will be stronger . Do n't fritter away this golden opportunity by grasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild-blue-yonder boys . The real job is down here on the oceans of the world . ' Pope did not volunteer for the second selection of astronauts , and he had put the matter pretty much out of mind when several things happened . In September 1962 when the new selections were announced , with the nine young men displayed on television , he shouted to Penny , who was visiting him from Washington , Hey , they took Pete Conrad ! You knew him at Pax River . You slept at his house one night , after the big party . ' And when Penny ran into the room she found her husband shouting with an excitementshe had rarely witnessed , That 's Frank Borman . I flew with him at Edwards . And I 'm sure that little guy on the end was John Young . He 's a terrific flier . If it 's the Young I knew , he 's a hard driver . ' - Now Pope began to follow with real longing the careers of the original Sacred Seven and the new Nifty Nine , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown with , men with whom he had conducted simulated dogfights in untested planes over the silvery waters of the Chesapeake or the barren flats at Edwards . He remembered going up to Pete Conrad one morning at Pax River and asking , Anything odd about this crate ? ' and he could almost hear the Princeton man instructing him : Very delicate when you try to land at low speeds . ' But his sudden interest related in no way to any dissatisfaction with his own career . Admiral Crane had guessed right about Pope 's good standing with the Navy hierarchy , because shortly after his perceptive observations at Jacksonville , John received notice of his promotion to full commander and an assignment as executive officer aboard his old carrier Tulagi , still stationed in the Pacific . This nipped any personal interest in space that might have been germinating , for as he prepared himself for his new duties , Crane stopped by to talk to him : Are n't you glad you stayed with the fleet ? Discharge this duty with distinction and you 'll earn yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any job we have . '  |p307Penny  was delighted to hear of his promotion and arranged to fly down to Pensacola for the party for which he would don his new stripes , and John was pleased to see how she radiated her pleasure . As they were dressing for the celebration she uttered a little yelp of glee as he donned his new uniform . You 're even more handsome as a full commander . ' Then she tried to talk about her job , but he was too preoccupied to follow the details . Later she said , I told you something about ten minutes ago , but you were n't listening . Senator Glancey 's had me busy getting authorization for a special selection of astronauts . The program 's moving ahead faster than we anticipated . Would you have any interest in volunteering ? ' Nope . I did , briefly , a few months back . But things have opened up better than I could have expected in the Navy chain of command . I 'm set . ' She kissed him ardently and cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the space program unfold , it seems so damned . . . well , hysterical . Politiciansusing it to get bases for their districts . Newspapers using it to up their sales . And this man from Folks laying his oily plans . In the end , many of the astronauts will be short-changed . ' Admiral Crane said the same thing , months ago . ' And I 've a strong feeling that when it 's at its height , the country will drop it like a bad tomato ! ' When John said he doubted that last statement , she said , I already see signs that Glancey is beginning to back off , and he 's an absolute litmus paper . He and Lyndon Johnson see things ten years before they happen . ' How about Grant ? ' He 's a dear , John . Red , white and blue right through the center of his limited brain . I love that man . ' She laughed uneasily , then added , I mean , my heart breaks for him sometimes . His dipsy-doodle wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What 's his daughter up to now ? ' Have n't you heard ? She 's a Ph.D . and dean of faculty at a university in Los Angeles . ' I do n't think that 's so crazy . ' But the university has no faculty . It sells beautifully engraved diplomas for five hundred dollars each . We can get you a second Ph.D . anytime you say the word . ' They had a passionate celebration in Pensacola , a treasured meeting of two people whose love had grown each year since high school , but an embarrassing moment occurred during the rowdy speeches in the officers ' club . John had said how much he appreciated his promotion , even though he was n't sure he deserved it  --  loud protests  --  when Penny rose , rattled her knife against her glass , and said , Promotions everywhere in the Pope family . ' Facing her husband , she said , I did n't want to intrude on your celebration , but I 'm the new permanent counsel of the Senate Space Com-mittee. '  |p308Amid  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and John , watching from his end of the table , had the ugly thought : That flush of excitement when she arrived was caused by her promotion , not mine . What he did not remember was that she had tried to tell him of her good luck but was prevented from doing so by his inattention . Then , dismissing such speculation as unworthy , he jumped from his chair , elbowed his way through the wives , caught Penny by her two hands , and drew her toward him for a kiss . Does permanent counsel mean you ca n't be fired ? ' Not unless I steal funds . ' Hooray ! We can afford a new car ! ' Commander Pope 's career would probably have proceeded according to Admiral Crane 's predictions had the carrier Tulagi remained in Pacific waters , but it did not , and when Pope reported for duty as executive officer he learned that his immediate assignment was to accompany the carrier out of Jacksonville and into the Caribbean , where it would serve as the principal recovery vessel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make in his Mercury capsule Aurora-7 . The briefing book for the recovery procedure contained one hundred and forty-one pages , with a biography of Carpenter which showed that he had learned his test-piloting at Pax River . From a first rapid reading of the instructions , Pope deduced that about two dozen Navy ships would be in position to monitor the flight and pick Carpenter up from whatever part of the ocean he landed in , Pacific or Atlantic , and that about 125 airplanes would be in flight to lend assistance . At the heart of everything he wrote to Penny will be the Tulagi , waiting with helicopters , powerboats and rescue frogmen to see that our boy gets down safely . We 'll spot the capsule on radar first , track it into our location , then pick it up visually so that we can vector our copters into the exact point he hits . It 's an amazing exercise in tactics and I 'm proud to have my ship play a part in it . He studied each page of the briefing book and became acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each moment : the lonely watchers on Ascension Island , the remote listeners in Australia , the men in the fail-safe destroyer near the Antarctic Ocean , the hundred-odd experts at Cape Canaveral who would follow each mile of the flight . And always he would come back to the duties of his carrier Tulagi , whose operations would close the circle and bring Scott Carpenter home safely . It was an intricate role the carrier had : to position itself properly so as to track the capsule as it descended under its parachute , then dispatch helicopters at the proper signal , deploy frogmen to rescue Carpenter if his system fouled the way Gus Grissom 's had endangered him on the secondp309Mercury flight , arrange for the orderly transfer of the astronaut to the carrier , and dispatch the proper messages to assure the world that the flight had ended safely . Much of this detail focused on Pope , and to ensure its proper execution he drilled his teams repeatedly , both in dry runs and in real-time simulations . Insofar as he could determine , the Tulagi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the great carrier steamed out of Jacksonville with sixteen newspaper and television reporters aboard , he told everyone , This is a military assignment . I shall expect outstanding performance . ' The Tulagi assumed its station in the Caribbean on the afternoon of 22 May 1962 , with the expectation that Carpenter would descend out of the skies in the late morning of 24 May . Helicopters were tested , radio circuits to the mainland were checked , and the frogmen were sent into the water on both the twenty-second and the twenty-third to be sure that they were familiar with temperatures and currents . Shortly before dawn on the morning of the twenty-fourth the Tulagi was hit by a chain of squalls that deposited a great amount of rain and caused some of the reporters to file disheartening stories , but by 0900 the storms had departed and the ocean had assumed a character so benevolent that one newsman said , Hell , he can water-ski over to us , ' and at that moment the powerboats that would deliver the frogmen to the capsule flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind that Columbus must have known when sailing these waters . Now the Tulagi began to receive reassuring messages from the control center at Cape Canaveral : Aurora-7 on target . All systems go . All stations reporting favorably . Splashdown as scheduled . ' But when the flight was about an hour from its completion , ugly little uncertainties began to intrude , and once Pope heard Cape Canaveral asking : How much fuel ? ' He did not hear the answer , but the Cape said : Check again . How much fuel ? ' Thirty minutes out it became apparent that something had gone badly wrong , because the Cape was signaling ships far distant from the Tulagi to prepare for possible recovery maneuvers , and when Pope checked to see where those vessels were  --  although he knew perfectly from his studies  --  he saw that they were two hundred and three hundred miles distant . ' What 's happening ? ' he demanded of a NASA specialist aboard the carrier , but that man could give no definite explanation : Fuel problem , apparently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Pope asked . ' Splash down , ' the NASA man corrected , and he said the words so mechanically , as if using the right terminology was important , that Pope wanted to slug him . ' Is he going to splash down here ? ' he asked , emphasizing each word , butp310before the NASA man could respond , the radio crackled : ' USS Intrepid , prepare to recover . ' The Intrepid was 25o miles away ! Shepard had landed almost on target . So had Gus Grissom , while Glenn 's landing had been marvelously good . This one was a fiasco , and as the minutes passed with nothing in the sky , John Pope stood by the railing of his carrier and came as close to cursing as he ever had . Why did we have to be the ones they cheated ? he asked himself again and again . He had practiced how he would greet Carpenter when he came aboard : Good afternoon , Scott . Some distance from Pax River . ' For two days on the trip out he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he knew her well , and the papers given him did not state it , so he had TWXed the Cape : WHAT NAME MRS . CARPENTER ? ' and they had replied ' RENE , ' and then of course he remembered . He had planned to end his greeting with : They assure us Rene is fine . ' It would have been a nice touch . And now it was all down the drain . The minutes passed and the surface of the Caribbean remained unruffled . No boats were launched , No helicoptersleft the deck . The great carrier rolled almost imperceptibly on the bosom of the sea , and John Pope became more and more outraged . When the radio announced that the Intrepid had made a good , routine recovery and that Carpenter was in fine shape despite his misadventure , Pope 's confusion reached an apex : he was wildly furious at having been robbed of an experience he had planned for , but he was also torn with longing : God , I want to fly again ! I want to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He bit his lower lip until the pain startled him : The Moon . I know every crater on the Moon . He remained by the ship 's railing , tears of desire flooding his eyes , and then he stormed down to his cabin , where with trembling fingers he typed out a dispatch to a friend at BuPers in Washington : I 'm informed that before NASA selects its first contingent of astronautstrained in science , it 's going to enroll a special group of six with intensive flight-test experience . I fulfill their specifications as to age , weight , height , combat duty and flight-test . I seek permission to apply and will clear personally with my commanding officer , Admiral Crane . To his surprise , the admiral flew personally to the Tulagi , where in the flag quarters he delivered a message from the Navy brass which astonished Commander Pope : John , I gave you bad advice at Jacksonville , and I apologize . When I cautioned you then against becoming an astronaut , I was thinking selfishly only of the Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how vital it 's going to become in the future to the Navy 's interest . NASA is going to pick six men in the special draft , we 're told , and it 's of maximum importance that at least two of them be Navy men . I know that the Army is grooming some of its likely candidates and the Air Force is frantic . They feel space belongs to them and that they 've been short-changed . We have to get in there fighting . We 've got to put our best men forward , and we all agree that you 're our prime candidate . The head of the selection committee is an Air Force astronaut you may have known at Edwards . Deke Slayton . This gives them a leg up , but they assure me he 's very fair . You know anything about him ? Well , study up . Find out what he likes to drink , what planes he flew , everything , because his veto is fatal . I suppose you know he was scheduled to take the flight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame him if he were bitter about it . But he 's the man you have to satisfy . ' Admiral Crane arranged for Pope to be relieved of duty aboard the Tulagi and flown to New York , where a selected group of Navy and civilian types briefed him and seven other Navy applicants on how men of promise conducted themselves when applying for important assignments .

' He specified some fifty signs which other men check for when seeking prime movers , and the young Navy men listened , but they remembered longest the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the Navy to become head of a large corporation : Men of substance , and that 's what the committee will be looking for , wear socks which reach to the knee . There 's nothing worse than to see an executive showing ten inches of bare leg . Not one of my assistants has a pair of brown socks or brown shoes . The work of the world is done by men who wear neatly polished black shoes.  |p312And  for God 's sake , if they ask you to dinner , which I 'm sure they will , remember three things . Do not drum nervously with your fork or spoon . Pick them up only to eat with , then put them down . Second , if drinks are ordered , do n't ask for wine . Men drink whiskey , never rum , that 's for exotics , and gin only in martinis . Third , it can be very effective if you eat English style , knife in right hand , fork in left . It lifts you out of the ordinary . ' A football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams were pretty awful , but from one of the Big Eight universities , which took educationseriously : I 've talked with men who were on the earlier selection committees and they have the widest possible interests . Look at the great job they 've done . Sixteen choices , sixteen winners . And they mean to extend that record . So try to create the impression that you 're rugged , that you can respond constructively to pressure . For Christ 's sake , do n't stand with your hands on your hips . Window dressers do that . But on the other hand , and this is important , do n't come at them like gangbusters . They 're not looking for gorillas , they 're looking for executive types who can take charge of a mission valued at billions of dollars . They know you 're brave or you would n't be in the final draft , so you do n't have to impress them with your heroism . They do n't want heroes , they want competents . Now , this is funny for me to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak in complete sentences . Because in your training you 'll have to do an immense amount of reading , a lot of writing . You can use test-pilot lingo , but do n't use a lot of er 's and uh 's , because there will be men in the group just as good as you are in flying planes who can also speak English . ' From New York , Pope and the others flew down to Houston , where they were registered under assumed names in the Rice Hotel . Since there would be four days of intensive interrogation and medical checking , the candidates were advised by means of a printed sheet on their pillows to get a good night 's sleep , and Pope did . He awakened early , determined to make a good impression on the committee , and after shaving , called his wife to assure her that he was in this to the bitter end : When I stood by the railing of that carrier , waiting for the sky to bring us its messenger , I knew I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pray for me , because this is what God intended me to be . ' When he walked briskly in to the committee , leaning slightly forwardp313in his polished shoes and knee-length black socks , he was enormously attractive , in a manly sort of way , five feet seven inches tall , one hundred and forty-seven pounds , close-cropped brown hair , thirty-two strong teeth , and eyes with 20-20 vision . He could write well , knew astronomy at the professional level , and carried with him one of the best records ever compiledat Pax River , but when he looked into the eyes of grim-faced Deke Slayton he realized that during the next few days this committee was going to meet with more than a hundred young pilots as good as he , and he was terrified . However , alongside the stern-faced military men on the selection committee , there was at one end of the table a man who looked more like a college professor . He was in his forties , perhaps , wore steel-rimmed glasses , smiled easily , and stood when Slayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Pope believed that his destiny rested in the vote of this sympathetic man , but then he saw with amazement the candidate who had preceded him , and his jaw dropped . The test pilot had lingered to speak with an Air Force officer on the board , and now saw Pope . Pope ! They must be scrapin ' the bottom of the barrel . ' It was Major Randy Claggett , the Marine 's favorite candidate and a man not at all overawed by the committee . When he clapped his old buddy on the back before sauntering from the room , Pope saw that he was not wearing kneelengthblack socks . It was a gala night for the Germans in Huntsville : a local cinema had obtained a print of the new motion picture I Aim at the Stars , and everyone bought tickets because this was the film biography of their hero , Wernher von Braun . There were rumors that the movie took unwarranted liberties with his life , and that in order to make it more appealing to female audiences , his well-remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy , but it was also said that the popular German actor Curt Jurgens gave a sensitive portrayal of Von Braun himself . At any rate , the Peenemunde gang appeared in full force , hoping for the best and eager to show their children what the German rocket center had been like . The program started with selections by the local orchestra , and young Magnus Kolff distinguished himself with a beautiful rendition of Carnival of Venice , which pleased his parents , who invited him to sit between them when the movie started , but he disappointed them by preferring to remain with the younger orchestra members . The movie was a disaster . Hardly an item of engineering background was accurate . The set bore no resemblance to Peenemunde , and the incidentswere so contrived as to be grotesque . The Kolffs looked in vain for any of the scenes they had known so well during their courtship , and other engineers were openly disgusted by the nonsense . Von Braun , fortunately ,  |p314was  not present to share the ignominy of this night , but all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even burlesqued . For example , the miracle of Dieter and Liesl Kolff 's escape with the crucial papers was not even mentioned , and what was worse , a newspaper in the area reprinted an irreverent review of the picture which had appeared in an English newspaper : I Aim at the Stars , but Sometimes Hit London . ' The Peenemunde people were outraged , and Mrs. Kolff told her son , A man as great as Von Braun , nobody should be allowed to make fun of him . '  |p315W  HEN STANLEY MOTT TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE DURING THE first meeting of the selection committee and saw the list of the hundred and ten applicants for the six available spots in the astronaut program , he went immediately to the chairman and said , I think I must disqualify myself . I know one of these men . ' Which one ? ' Number forty-seven . Charles Lee , Army test pilot . If he uses the nicknameHickory , I know him . He worked for me as gate-guard at Huntsville . ' What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finest kid I ever knew . My wife thought the same about his wife , another hillbilly called Sandra . I told him to quit his guard 's job and get himself an education . ' Did he ? ' Yep . My wife found his wife a nursing job . He went to Vanderbilt . Graduated with honors . ' That 's the kind of man we 're seeking . Stay here and share your opinion with us . ' I wo n't vote when his name comes up . ' If he 's that good , you wo n't have to . ' So Mott had stayed , had studied each of the competitors , and had voted strongly for Randy Claggett of Texas and John Pope of Fremont , both of whom were accepted . His rugged testimonial on behalf of Hickory Lee enabled that young man to make the list also , but his three other choices were rejected . After the six winners had been introduced to the public at a large press conference , NASA officials handed Mott a radical new assignment , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You 're a sensible man . Know a lot about engineering and science . We want you to look after the indoctrination and education of these young men . The wayp316things are going , they 'll form the backbone of our program some years down the line and we want them to be in top shape . ' The first thing Mott did was to check his impressions of the six new astronauts against the more technical knowledge of the psychiatrist who had supervised the analyses of the original hundred and ten , dismissing about thirty out of hand , and he found Dr. Loomis Crandall of a clinic in Denver a most engaging fellow . A chain-smoker , prematurely gray , he was in his early forties , a graduate of the University of Chicago with advanced work in Vienna and Rome and solid experience as an Air Force psychologistat Colorado Springs . His youthful energy , coupled with his gray hair , lent him exactly the proper combination of erudition and street smarts for working with brash young test pilots . He did not speak jargon . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are six of the most highly motivated young men in America . Look at their faces . Look at their records . ' And he spread on the table six large photographs of the winners , each with a three-line summary : Randolph Claggett , 1929 . Texas A &; M. Major , USMC . Patuxent River . Charles Hickory ' Lee , 1933 . Vanderbilt Univ . Major , US Army . Edwards . Timothy Bell , 1934  --  Univ . of Arkansas . Civilian . Allied Aviation test pilot . Harry Jensen , 1933  --  Univ . of Minnesota . Captain , US Air Force . Edwards . Edward Cater , 1931 . Mississippi State . Major , US Air Force . Edwards . John Pope , 1927 . Annapolis . Cmdr. , US Navy . Patuxent River . Mott checked this list as Dr. Crandall recited his conclusions : Pope 's the oldest , Bell 's the youngest , the rest are nicely bunched . Homogeneous in most other ways , too . All Protestant . All from small towns . All married and all with at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or South . Now , that last point 's significant . To have passed our strict surveillance , these men must have had a central tendency in their lives . Good behavior , bravery , a certain religious bent . The whole mix . And what do you suppose is the best name for that ? Patriotism . Old-fashioned patriotism . And where do you find that these days ? Mainly in the South . In the Civil War country . Mott , if you took one thousand of the men who really run the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines , you 'd find that seventy percent of them come from the South , which has only . . . what ? Thirty percent of the population . Totally out of proportion , but that 's because the heroic occupations have always appealed to the Southern man . . . and the Southern woman . Look at the list . Texas , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi . And the chap who graduated from Minnesota was born in South Carolina . Went north onlyp317because his family was Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked why the astronauts so far contained no Catholics , and Crandall had a prompt answer : What have we insisted on in these first groups ? Training in math , engineering , science , test-piloting most of all . And what does test-piloting demand ? Training in math , engineering , science . And what do the great Catholic schools emphasize ? Anything but math , engineering and science . So up to now a young man trained in the Catholic tradition has simply not been eligible . Hell , I 'm Catholic . I desperately wanted a Catholic in this batch , especially since none appeared in the first groups . But where to find one ? Not at Notre Dame . Not at Villanova . ' He pushed his papers back and said enthusiastically , We 've got some great leads for a couple of hotshot Catholicsin the next batch . ' Crandall emphasized the conspicuous fact that almost all the astronauts so far , and certainly all of this group , came from small towns . I 've pondered this , and it ca n't be genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a socioeconomicfactor . Boys from small towns tend to live close to their parents . They 're urged to take things seriously . Their families encouraged them to study , join the Boy Scouts , play games . These men , all of them , had characteringrained in them by the time they were ten . You can get that in the city , but more often you 're led into other channels . Business . Manipulative professions like the one I 'm in . Political management . ' He paused . I ' 11 tell you one thing , Mott , I 'd hate to live in a country governed by these astronauts . Very conservative . Very unimaginativein any field outside their own . They 're all Republicans , you know . ' But he also stressed what Mott already knew , that these men were determined to succeed . Every one is a superachiever , driven by the most profound determination to do things right . Cowardice , recalcitrance , the temptation to do sloppy work , all suppressed . Their capacity to do extra work is unbelievable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their education , do n't fear to pile it on . These men will learn ten times as much as the average A student . Ten times as much as you or I could have mastered . These are super machines . ' When Mott queried him about one peculiarity shared by the six , Crandallgrew expansive . The point you raise worried me at first . Twenty-two astronauts  --  twenty-two of the best young men in America and not an outstanding athlete among them . Why ? Well , I did a lot of double-doming and came up with a batch of fancy explanations . " Boys with the amount of drive they have do n't waste their time with games . " Or maybe " Engineeringand science require so much lab work , there 's no time for daily football practice . " Or perhaps " In athletics the motivations are all external . What the coach says . What the rules say . In the fields these men work in , the disciplines are internal . " I had half a dozen other goodies , and when Ip318discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased that in this most demanding of life tests , the superathletes did not do poorly . They did nothing . Blank . ' He raised his hands as if to confess his bewilderment , then broke into a cheerful laugh . Stupid me ! I had overlooked one simple fact which explained it all . In each successive selection , we 've picked smaller men . So they can fit into the machines we 're building . If we had selected the really bright football linemen , and there are some , believe me , they 'd have stood six feet four and weighed two hundred and fifty . One of those gorillas would require more space than two of our men like Grissom and Young . As a matter of fact , the engineers who build the machines wish we 'd keep the maximum height something less than five-eight and the weight no more than one-sixty . ' Mott said , I seem to remember that John Pope did pretty well in football . Claggett , too . ' They all played games , ' Crandall conceded . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first twenty-two was what you 'd call a superjock , and very sneakily I weasel back to my first guess . They were n't because men like these do not waste their time on sports , for the good reason that the goals they 've set for themselves will not permit that extravagance . ' He made two other warning points . Astronauts by an enormous margin are first-born children . They 've been pampered . They have powerful egos . Their parents may have driven them too hard , but they also loved them . These men expect to be cared for . Do not brush them off . On the other hand , no astronaut , regardless of the pressure we put him under , has ever developed a gastric ulcer . These sonsabitches know something you and I have n't learned . Work like hell all day , but turn it off at night . Eat a good meal and get a good night 's sleep . So you do n't have to treat them like china . These bastards are tough . ' He had more statistical analyses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that since the salient points had been covered , it was time to bring in a man with whom Mott would be forced to work in close tandem . I want you to meet Tucker Thompson , chief honcho for Folks magazine . He 's primarily responsible for breaking the stranglehold Life had on the astronauts , and he 's got to make good on these six or get fired . ' Before Mott could say I 've already met Thompson , ' the editor burst eagerly into the room , smiling enthusiastically , and Mott had an opportunity to inspect more closely the man with whom he would be working . He was tall , bronzed , about fifty , and when he extended his hand , his cuff disclosed an imposing link made of a large gold nugget . He wore a buttondowncollar and a tie of rich solid color , a pair of exquisitely pressed black trousers , an expensive white jacket and , of course , tasseled shoes . He was slightly bald , a fact which showed to good advantage when he smiled , for then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanned skin , shimmeringeyes and very white teeth.  |p319I  'm Tucker Thompson , ' he said , starting to step forward . But then he stopped , drew back , and pointed at Mott with a long forefinger . Hey ! I know you . I met you in Senator Grant 's office . You 're ... ' He hesitated . You 're Dr. Mott . ' He brought with him a set of the family photographs already taken by his magazine , and when he spread them on the desk , Dr. Crandall added an obvious point : Yes , I forgot to say . These young men were never afraid to marry the prettiest girl in town . No psychological hang-ups about the conflicting roles of husband and wife . Boom ! They 're in bed . ' And with a pencil he identified the wives . Four normal . Two problems . The Swede Jensen married the Swede Inger . All-American , all-Americans . The Tennessee boy they call Hickory married a daughter of a Tennessee hillbilly , and every man should be so lucky . Outdoor type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when she dresses up ! Get back in line , you guys . ' Mott studied Mrs. Lee 's photograph and marveled at how far she had progressed from the rather awkward girl he had known at Huntsville . She was a friend of my wife 's . Look at those steely eyes . That one can do anything she puts her mind to . ' The civilian Bell , ' Dr. Crandall continued , the lad so highly recommended by Senator Glancey , found himself a real doll , as you can see . Probably the best mother of the group . ' She photographs like a million , ' Tucker Thompson said . With or withoutthe three kids . ' Ed Cater , the Air Force man from Mississippi , married himself a woman who is most deceptive . Looks like Miss Confederacy but ran a mortgage firm before she married Ed . Bright as they come . ' I do n't see any problems there , ' Mott said , adjusting his glasses . Except my own . Keeping my mind on the job . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if I 'd have been on the selecting committee , I do n't think I 'd 've allowed these two in . They damage our case . ' He pointed to the photograph of Debby Dee Claggett : loose-fitting blouse , sandals , blond hair somewhat awry , smoking a cigarette . Frankly , she looks blowzy . We had a board meeting to decide how we should play her . She 's not an outdoor type . She 's not a cover girl . And she has two real significant drawbacks . Two of her kids are by another man . He 's dead , of course . They were legally married . And I find she has the habit of calling anyone she does n't like , or likes a great deal , " that sonnombeech . " ' Distastefully he turned Debby Dee 's photograph face downward and in its place produced a real horror . Our makeup people decided to see what they could do with Debby Dee . What do you think ? ' In her improved version Debby Dee wore frills about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a smile displaying more than twenty teeth , two of which had been filled with gold.  |p320Nobody  spoke , and after a while Tucker Thompson confided : When she saw the photo she said , " That sonnombeech looks like a Shanghai whore . " We have a problem with Debby Dee . ' What did your board decide ? ' Mott asked . We can play her two ways . Texas wholesome . We can claim her father owned a large ranch . ' Did he ? ' Nobody knows where he is . ' He coughed . Or what I proposed , we can stress the death of her first husband . ' But you said his being the father of two of the kids was a drawback , ' Crandall said . In our business you often take a weakness and make an asset of it . Throw it right in the public 's face . We 've been checking the record , and she seems to have behaved with extraordinary courage when her husband went down . We have some pictures . We can claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for the orphans , all that jazz . We convert a liability into an asset . ' Your best bet , ' Crandall said , is to play her as a windblown original . ' Dangerous , ' Thompson warned . Very dangerous . Because you never know how the American public is going to react to an original . Especially a female original . Now you take two all-time winners , Gertrude Stein and Amy Lowell . God , you could n't get two zanier women than that , but we took them to our hearts . Now we sell automobiles with Picasso 's portrait of Gertrude Stein . We might have the same phenomenon with Debby Dee , but we might not , too . ' Can we prohibit her from saying sonnombeech in public ? ' Crandall asked . I 'm not sure that Debby Dee will take correction , ' Thompson said , and with this he turned to his last photograph , Mrs. John Pope , legal counsel to the Senate Space Committee . She appeared in office garb , a neat red skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar and a string of beautiful imitation pearls . Her hair was pulled back and fastened with a barrette , but it was her dark eyes which commanded attention . We saw her , you know , ' Mott reminded the editor , in Senator Grant 's office . ' I remember . In an office she 's great . But in our effort , she could turn out to be poison . ' Why ? ' Mott asked . She fills your bill completely , I 'd say . Small town . Attends church . Childhood sweetheart . ' She 's a time bomb , gentlemen , ' Thompson said from long experience . What has Life discovered with its astronauts ? On the day the flight takes off you want a news photo of the wife waiting at home , or maybe praying in church . The kids . The white picket fence . The distressed neighbors on whom she leans . If one of the sons has a skateboard , so much the better , but a bicycle 's best of all . The daughter with a doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the space shot much more real than the pictures of the rocket blasting off . Now what the hell do we photograph if Astronaut John Pope takes off on a dangerous mission ? His wife in her Washington office biting a pencil ? She ought to be miles from Washington in some small town in a white house with a picket fence . And dammit , she does n't have any children . Everything about this capable woman adds up wrong . And do you know what I fear ? These damned professional women . During the flight , when we ca n't keep the ordinary press away from her , she 'll say something . " Why are n't there any Colored in the program ? " " When will they take women up the way the Russians have just done ? " God knows what she 'll say , but you can bet it 'll be counterproductive . ' He tapped the handsome photograph with his pencil and predicted : That woman 's a nuclear bomb . Planted right at the heart of my program . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave girl works in the very office , et cetera , et cetera . ' In my business , ' Thompson said , you 're not to be too clever . Stick to the little house and the white fence . And do you know why ? Two-thirds of our readers are women , and they instinctively despise bright young women like Penny Pope who hold jobs and keep their weight down . ' Except for Debby Dee , ' Mott pointed out , your first four are rather thin . ' But they 're also pretty . Like models . Women expect models to be thin . And none of them is contaminated by having a job . ' With a broad sweep of his hand he indicated the entire gallery . If a woman is pretty , thin is beautiful . If she has an administrative job , thin is avaricious and meanspirited . You tell me what to do with this one . ' And he pointed accusingly at Penny Pope . All such questions became vital to Rachel Mott when NASA employed her to act as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts . She got the exciting assignment because of the excellent record being compiled by her husband , but everyone who knew her realized that she was perfectly suited for such a task . She was a mature forty-three , always well groomed , a fine housekeeper with children of her own , and a Bostonian with a strong sense of obligation . When she and Stanley took up residence near the new space headquarters in Houston , she was distressed when Millard elected to remain in California with the young men of the surfboard coterie , but she was pleased to see how easily Christopher , now thirteen , adapted himself to life in Texas . What gratified her especially was the respect shown her husband by everyoneat NASA , where he was recognized not only as the mentor of the new astronauts but also as one of the most brilliant of the permanent staff . It seemed that he moved from one important ad hoc committee to another ,  |p322serving  first as an engineer on some highly technical problem , then as a scientist on matters dealing with outer space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducting the six young men into the mysteries of NASA , and within a week of their reporting to Houston he had them scheduled into a round of learning situations which resembled advanced work in some fine engineering university , except that the men had two hours a day of theory and ten hours of laboratory . This schedule would continue for about six months , after which they would move into specialized applications . Such concentrated work left the wives free to follow their own obligationsand interests , and this was where Rachel Mott 's responsibilities began . Tucker Thompson saw to it that the wives were photographed regularly at those occupations which would best represent the female half of the NASA effort . Since three of the women had strong church affiliations  --  with the most respectable denominations , not the Holy Roller type that flourishedin the South  --  there was a fruitful opportunity for shots of a reassuring nature : Sunday School , picnics , suppers for old folk , standing outside the church with the other parishioners on Sunday morning . He was also very strong on family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League baseball games ; he had a low opinion of basketball : Mostly a Colored game these days . Baseball is what our readers have faith in . ' Rachel saw the women at their more normal tasks , and although at first they had been suspicious of her , judging her to be a NASA spy , they came in time to respect her professionalism and her force of character . She was both sympathetic and persuasive and was never reluctant to express a strong opinion if she felt it needed . Her neatness , her command of English and her taste in clothes were impressive to these young women , who were equally attentive to their own appearances . She had a hard time with Debby Dee , who was only six years younger and not disposed to pay much attention to what anyone presumed to tell her , but Rachel did not brood upon this failure , for she found the Texas woman far too brash for her taste and the Claggett children even less disciplined than her own . The Claggetts were not a family she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband reported that he was not having much success with Major Claggett . He finishes his work faster than others and he knows airplanes inside out , but he 's very difficult to communicate with . Fends everything off with a joke . ' Like everyone else , Rachel found herself in love with the Swedes , Harry and Inger Jensen , for they were attractive , bright and extremely eager to please . Perpetual Boy Scouts , ' someone described them , and Harry had indeed been an Eagle Scout . They were a pair easy to identify in that each had blond hair and a narrow triangular face . Their eyes were blue ; they smiled incessantly ; and they were in love . She worried about the civilian couple , for they seemed to lack the harsh fiber that characterized the military families , even though Stanley assuredp323her that Tim Bell was one of the hottest pilots private industry had so far produced . General Funkhauser of Allied Aviation does not recommend a man who ca n't cut the mustard . Look for the wife 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Bells , as Rachel saw it , was that the husband was inordinately good-looking , while the wife had that baby-doll prettiness which often spelled danger . Since she photographed magnificently , and since her husband looked more like a hotshot test pilot than any of the other men , their pictures were widely distributed , and in time Mrs. Mott came to agree that despite their possible weaknesses , the Bells were a considerable asset to the program . She found it easy to like the three pretty Southern wives , Cater , Jensen , Lee ; they conducted themselves well , assisted whenever called upon , and seemed indistinguishable from the millions of resilient wives who had accompaniedtheir husbands in ages past when the latter went forth with Julius Caesar to the frontiers of empire , or with Robert Clive to the pacificationof India , or with Douglas MacArthur to his occupation of Japan . They were professionals , and since she had made herself one at El Paso and Huntsville , she respected them . Gloria Cater , the one-time business woman from Mississippi , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a tough sense of self-protection . Inger Jensen was frail , talkative and great fun to be with . But the gem of the Dixie contingent , in Rachel Mott 's opinion , had to be tomboy Sandra Lee from the hills of central Tennessee . She had been extremely fond of this self-directed beauty and saw with approval that Sandy apparently assessed the NASA experience with neat accuracy . She could turn on whatever mood Tucker Thompson and his photographers wanted , then walk away untouched by the nonsense . Rachel enjoyed hearing her tell how Hickory had wound up an astronaut : My boy tore Vanderbilt apart . Straight A 's . Earned a commission in the Army , then his wings , then a master 's in aeronautical engineering at MIT , straight A 's again . ' But Rachel noticed that one could approach the Lees only so far ; then the mountain couple retreated ; they did not permit anyone to know them intimately . Rachel felt her closest identification with Penny Pope , of Washington , for in this competent , self-directed woman she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own life , plus a high degree of personal charm which she herself had never been able to generate . Also , Mrs. Pope was obviously more gifted intellectually than the other five and therefore more rewarding to talk with on the few occasions when she left her duties with the Senate to visit with her husband . Rachel did not feel , like some other NASA personnel , that this Pope dame is a cool customer , ' for she sensed the strong opinions and great warmth Penny was capable of , but she did know that the perfectly groomed young woman from the West was going to present problems quite different from those offered by the Southern belles . Rachel Mott liked Penny Pope , liked her enormously , but she also feared her. ikp324Well , what do we have ? ' Tucker Thompson asked at the beginning of the fourth week , when his magazine was preparing its initial presentation of the six wives . What I 'm looking for is a theme to hand the American public , and especially the American housewife . Because these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them that way . ' They 're beautiful . Your photographers should have an easy time . ' But we 've got to show them as more than beautiful . We 're after their collective soul , and in this game first impressions are fatal . ' They 're intelligent . There 's not a dummy in the lot . Even Debby Dee Claggett is as sharp as a pin , in her own way . ' Intelligence is a negative factor when you 're trying to sell a group of women . One woman , like Oveta Culp Hobby , yes . The public can take pride in an exception . But not six . We 're looking for the theme that will make America 's heart sing . We do not have an easy job , Mrs. Mott , and I 'd appreciate some serious help from you . ' Start with the beauty , Tucker , but call it " the well-scrubbed American look , " and then make a virtue of their diversity . Use Tomboy Sandra . Use cool , efficient Mrs. Cater , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real goody in Mrs. Pope 's quietly helping to make decisions that enable her hero husband to fly his dangerous missions . Unity in diversity is your theme , Tucker . Or maybe it 's diversity in unity . ' There were several exhaustive meetings on the subject of how to present the wives , but in the end , it was Rachel Mott 's ideas about the cover which prevailed : A small American flag in the center , blowing in the breeze , surrounded by the six wives shown in the most carefully chosen vignettes . Sandy Lee with an Indian sweatband around her head . Gloria Cater chewingan executive pencil . Penny Pope standing before a Senate eagle . Cluny Bell with her left hand framing her fragile face . Inger Jensen in an Eton collar being her adorable self . And Debby Dee Claggett  --  ' She stopped . How could the big Texas woman best be depicted ? Tentativelyshe suggested , With a martini glass , a cigarette .. One thing for sure , ' Thompson said , our psychological studies prove that in a circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lower left-hand corner . Debby Dee comes in at eight o'clock . ' The cover was a sensation , the handsome American flag surrounded by six of its most appealing daughters . As soon as customers started writing in for copies without printing so they could be framed , Folks ran off two hundred thousand and sold them for twenty-five cents each , and when the lot was gone and the six wives properly presented , Thompson had one of his secretaries summarize the mail : Most comment on : Inger Jensen , the one everyone would like to have as their daughter . Least comment on : Penny Pope , who struck readers as indifferent and why was n't she with her husband ? Mostp325liked : Debby Dee Claggett , who looked like the best mother in the lot . Consensus : An American bouquet the nation can be proud of . Rachel Mott felt , with some justification , that she had played a helpful role in getting her six debutantes properly launched into the American social season , but on the day when Virgil Grissom and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gemini , she discovered that she was living in a fool 's paradise . It was a tense moment in space history , when the fate of the national program hung in the balance and when the safety of two astronauts  --  not one , as before  --  was at stake . All NASA was on edge , and Tucker Thompson felt that this might be a good moment for the general press to see how the new wives reacted to the machine in which their own husbands would shortly be flying . He called Mrs. Mott : Rachel , where are the girls ? ' I believe four of them are watching the television at Gloria Cater 's . ' Marvelous . That 'll make a great shot . But why only four ? ' Mrs. Pope 's in Washington , as usual . And Inger Jensen 's visiting herfolks in Minnesota . ' Damn ! She 's the most photogenic of the lot . That little-girl charm . Well , we 'll go with what we have . Meet me at the Caters ' . ' He was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a picket fence , has n't it ? ' When they reached the Cater home Thompson explained to the waiting newsmen the ground rules governing the interviews and photography : These women are under extreme tension . They 've gathered here for mutual support . No harsh questions . Nothing at all about what would happen if the mission failed . ' Rachel should have gone into the cottage first to alert the wives , but she stayed outside to coach the women reporters on the personalities of the four wives , and this meant that Tucker got to the living room first . He almost fainted , for he found the women with their shoes off , playing gin rummy and drinking martinis , while the television droned on , with no one paying attention . Mrs. Claggett and the hostess , Mrs. Cater of Mississippi , were smoking cigarettes . Good God ! ' Thompson cried . A sacred moment in history . Men 's lives in the balance . And you 're playing poker . ' Gin , ' Mrs. Cater said . The press is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world . Get your shoes on . ' Sandy Lee took charge , and in her most efficient manner swept up the cards , hid the martinis and whisked away all sights of debauchery . Then , with the utterly disarming charm that she could turn on when needed , she went to the door and said quietly , Persons from the major wire services and two reporters from overseas may come in for fifteen minutes . Then we 'll come out and meet with you for as long as you wish . Because thisp326is a historic moment and we feel deeply proud to play even a minor part in it . ' With graciousness unbounded she escorted the five selected newspeople into the cottage , then smiled bravely at the sixty or seventy others as she closed the door and moved to where Gloria and Cluny and Debby Dee were staring at Walter Cronkite on the television screen . The program for which the new astronauts had been selected was named Gemini because for the first time two men were to fly the spacecraft in a compartment so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained there immobilized for periods of up to fourteen days . When Dr. Mott actually inspected the capsule , he appreciated what Crandall had said about NASA 's restraints on the height and weight of its astronauts ; no two men of normal-large dimension could possibly wedge themselves into this confined space , and even highly trained men like the lean astronauts had trouble doing so . Gemini was a form of exploration unprecedented in world history , and it demanded men of agility , bravery and enormous competence . At the beginning of the six-month indoctrination , Deke Slayton , lean and mean , appeared before the astronauts with a stack of basic manuals and specific flight plans twenty-seven inches thick . By the time your name is called for a flight , you will have memorized everything in boldface and understood the rest . ' The basic manuals were like intricate games for grown-up children , in that each depicted in the most carefully analyzed form the operation of some one system of the Gemini craft : in one , colored diagrams showed the movement of electricity through literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-away drawings of the type developed in World War II to facilitate the repair of airplanes showed how the hydraulic system worked ; in yet another , four cleverly printed sheets of transparent plastic lay one atop the other to allow the astronaut to see inside one of his rocket thrusters . The fields of knowledge seemed endless , sixteen major concentrations of information , all of which had to be mastered , and regardless of which field the men attacked next , the same rule applied : two hours of intellectual discussion , ten hours of laboratory break-down , then two hours of comparingnotes and ten more hours of tackling the problem physically . From its earliest days NASA had followed a sensible program of requiringall its astronauts to study everything , but then to assign each man a field of specialization in which he was expected to become a top expert , familiar with the most arcane concepts and possible future developments . It was always an exciting time when these assignments were made , and one morningDeke Slayton appeared with a list : Claggett , because of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've already done a lotp327with electronics , the electrical system . Bell , because you specialized in aerodynamics at Allied Aviation , flight surfaces . Jensen , because you 're small and tight , flight gear and survival mechanisms . Cater , because you 've done good work on propulsion at Edwards , rockets . Pope , because of your doctorate in astronomy , navigation and computers . ' John noticed that whenever assignments of any kind were published , the same pecking order maintained , with Claggett at the top and himself at the bottom , and one day when he was alone in Dr. Mott 's office he saw on the desk a list giving the names in the accustomed ranking and titled ORDER OF SELECTION . Since he was reading upside down , he had no time to decipher the typing which accompanied the list , but when Mott returned , he asked him bluntly , Why am I at the bottom of the list ? ' You were n't supposed to see that . ' I did n't read it . Just saw the title and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawer he said , That 's the order in which you were selected . There 's no better airman around than Claggett . I suppose you know that . ' I knew him in Korea and Pax River . The best . ' The others have terrific records , Pope . This boy Bell , the civilian . He flew everything with wings and helped Allied improve every machine they ever made . ' But why me at the bottom ? ' Since Pope seemed bewildered by this ranking , Mott decided to level with him . It was n't your flying . You 're up there with the best . And certainly not your bravery , because in Korea and Pax River . . . well , you have the medals to prove that . ' What was it ? What 's my hidden weakness , because I certainly do n't know and I ought to . ' Patterns , ' Mott said , and when the young flier looked amazed , he added , You did n't conform to the patterns . You do n't live with your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble , especially your wife . NASA feels safer when unknowns like Claggett and Lee conform to patterns . Because then the numbers are in our favor . With you we were flying in the dark . I think you know that . ' When Pope made no reply , Mott said , It surfaced in Korea and it certainly surfaced at Patuxent . ' What surfaced ? ' That you were a loner . ' What 's that got to do with it ? Seems to me , the main thing is . . . I was also good , ' Pope said with that charming frankness which characterized the best test pilots . John Pope was one of the best fliers in the business ; he knew it and was not hesitant about claiming his rights . That 's why we chose you , John . ' This sudden use of his first name , as if the discussion had entered a new and more confidential phase , mollified the astronaut , and he asked , Why were you willing to overlook the anomal-ies ? '  |p328And  now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this context , relaxed Mott , and he broke into a laugh . Taking off his glasses , he looked at Pope , nine years his junior and one of the most capable men he had ever met , and said , We chose you because we knew that in the air you would prove to be one of the very best men on our roster . And you will be . ' But on the ground , watch out . ' Yes . ' An embarrassed pause , then : Any chance you could persuade your wife to quit her job and move down here to Houston ? ' None . ' Pope blew his nose , more to gain time than for any other reason , then said , Penny told me last weekend that she felt your wife was the person closest to what she 's like . You must have faced these same problems . ' Curious . My wife said the same about Mrs. Pope . " More like me than any of the others . " But I never faced your problem , John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I 'll tell you about El Paso . And getting eased out at Huntsville . My wife stayed close . ' Mine does n't , ' Pope said crisply , and without waiting for Mott to indicate that the interview was over , he rose and left the room . The specialty he had been assigned delighted him , and had he had a free choice from the entire field , he would have elected astronomy and the new navigational systems , for he found them captivating . They drive my mind to its ultimate capacities , ' he wrote his wife , and I feel constantly submerged . But damn it all , I 'll work it out in the end . ' The heavy problem of field trips prevented him from becoming narrowly specialized in navigation , for the astronauts were required to jump about the nation and the world with an agility that left some watchers bewildered . In one three-month period Pope and Claggett were occupied with these trips : ... To Worcester , Massachusetts , the David Clark Company , to be fitted for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope in which he might walk in space . ... To Los Angeles , California , for a two-day meeting with General Funkhauser 's men , who had won a contract to supply the controls in the capsule . ... To St. Louis , Missouri , the McDonnell Astronautics Co. , to work on the spacecraft itself . ... To Cleveland , Ohio , to work at NASA 's Lewis Center on the performance of jet engines and rockets . ... To Sunnyvale , California , the Lockheed Space Company , to check the progress of the Agena target vehicle with which Gemini would hook up in outer space.  | ... To Owego , New York , IBM , for familiarization with the new , smaller computers which would run the spacecraft . ... To Fort Apache , Arizona , to engage in a three-day survival test on the desert , finding food and water as they became available . ... To Canoga Park , California , Rocketdyne , to study the principles and controls governing reentry through the atmosphere . ... To Redondo Beach , California , the Ramo Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 319 industrial sites where components of the Gemini program were being assembled , including many of the foremost names in American business : Bell , Burroughs , CBS , Douglas , Engelhard Minerals , General Electric , General Motors , B. F. Goodrich , and on down the line . Some of the excursions had special meaning to the fledgling astronauts , but each man seemed to identify particularly some visit which proved unique for him . Hickory Lee came back from the wild C-135 parabolic flights at Edwards Air Force Base ecstatic : By damn , they took me up there to forty thousand feet , flew damned near straight up , then turned the nose down , and in that swift change , Zoom ! No gravity ! I bounced around in the padded cargo space like a feather in a Texas tornado . Absolutely no gravity . For thirty-two seconds . Down we went , then up again in the parabolic curve , then over and down . We did it thirty-eight times and I came out bruised from ass to elbow . Them mats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days he kept talking about those moments of accidental freedom from the pull of Earth . Some men found it difficult physiologically to adjust to the C-135 routine ; all they got was an unmerciful pounding as the huge plane nosed down , and John Pope was one of these : I was probably free of gravity , as they say , but I barely knew it . ' What imparted the sense of space to him were two much more mundane experiments , but in a way more sophisticated , since they depended upon simple perceptions of gravity . If you 're like me and fail to catch the feeling in that bang-about C-135 , ' he advised the others , try that Langley Space Walk they showed us in the movies . Outstanding ! ' But his closest approach to a perception of null gravity came in a swimming pool , or rather a huge cubic tank installed at the new center in Huntsville , where in full astronaut 's gear he was thrown into the water wearing just enough lead weights about his waist to achieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not real weightlessness , you understand , because if you stood on your head in the water , blood rushed to your head , because gravity still operated . But there was a marvelous sensep330of freedom . I loved it . Whenever I suited up and the crane dropped me into the drink , I thought I was a medieval knight being hoisted onto my white charger . But my lance was a monkey wrench . The world I was to conquer was outer space . ' The most dramatic expedition was Randy Claggett 's to Johnsville , the Naval Air Center , just north of Philadelphia , where he was to undergo tolerance tests on the mammoth centrifuge . Using exactly the kind of whirling machine used to separate cream from milk , but on a larger scale permitting many more controlled variations , the men conducting the tests placed their subject in a pilot 's chair and whirled him about at ever faster speeds until the required G was reached : One look at that sonnombeech and I wanted out . They strapped me in eyeballs out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I said , " How in hell do I know ? " and they said , " Well , you 're gon na find out . " It was kind of hairy , but I yelled , " I ai n't feelin ' no pain , " so they yelled , " Here come fifteen big ones , " and I had a little trouble focusin ' my eyes , but when they yelled , " Think you could take twenty ? " I yelled back , " Let me outa here , " and they said , " You 're the judge , " and when I got out , the register marked sixteen G 's . That 's what I took . But they was this farm-boy sailor sort of standin ' around and he volunteered to try the machine , and when they strapped him in they ran it to fifteen pretty fast and he grinned and yelled , " I kin take it , " and they whomped him up to eighteen and asked if he 'd like to go for twenty , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that and then told him that no one had hit twenty-one yet , and he said , " Give it a whirl , " but he was spinnin ' so fast the words kinda slipped outa the corner of his mouth , and they gave him twenty-one G 's for about ten seconds . Dreadful pressure . When they stopped the centrifuge he jumped down as good as new , but he was kinda dizzy , I could see that . He started home drivin ' his own car , but when I left the test area I saw him parked dead across the median strip , sound asleep . His brain musta been completely addled by the twenty-one G 's , but when I took him back to the base the doctors never gave a damn . I often wonder what happened to that farm boy . ' The excursions , which never abated , were made doubly enjoyable when NASA acquired the use of several dozen T-38 two-seater supersonic Northrop jet trainers . These were sleek , exciting aircraft which could hit Mach 1.3 or better , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the airfield and whip a T-38 through the sky to Houston in time for dinner was a delight.  |p331Because  the T-38 could carry two , Claggett and Pope , as two buddies from Pax River , often found themselves sharing a plane on some swift flight to a contractor 's meeting or to the next field test , and one day they flew to Key West for a drill on parachute landings in water , since every emergency had to be anticipated . For three days the two pilots were hauled aloft in an old DC-3 and tossed overboard at a height of 9,000 feet . As they descended , slowly twisting in the Caribbean sunlight , they would make silent bets as to which powerboat on the waves below would get to them first . On the third afternoon , when the tests were over , they sped to the airfield , climbed into their T-38 and flew across the Gulf of Mexico to the haven of Ellington Air Force Base north of the Houston space center , landing just as the sun was setting behind the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , and to have a T-38 at one 's disposal , with airfields across the nation at which one could land for fuel or for a critical meeting , was to know the best of life . By no means was it recreation ; the pilots had to do this flying to maintain their skills , and it was obligatory that they fly a certain number of hours each month , some at night , to qualify for the salary adjustments which meant so much to them . Hell , ' Claggett said , me and Debby Dee , we could n't live on my base pay . Without that good ole flight pay , our kids would have to live on grits . ' The flight they liked best was from Houston to Cape Canaveral , for this meant that they were headed toward the mystical site from which they would one day soar off into space , and with a kind of reverence , they approached the sandy spit on which the launching pads waited . This is for real , ' Claggett cried one day as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , several of the most effective simulators were located at the Cape , and the astronauts never wearied of climbing into these extraordinary devicesand going through imaginary flight procedures . NASA had developed a simulator for everything , Claggett said , except tying your shoes , and the minute that becomes important , presto , they 're gon na have one . ' There was a simulator for launch , another for coming back through the atmosphere . There was one for the guidance system , another for the computers . There was an amazing simulator for aborting a flight , and a Rube Goldberg type , all angles and elbows , for landing on the Moon . There was a simulator covering every conceivable emergency , but the best of all was operated by a tall , mournful doctor in engineering from Purdue University who had a kind of Fu Manchu beard and whom everyone called Dracula . His job was to anticipate disaster , to imagine the worst possible outcome of every step his astronauts would take and then to simulate the disasters they might encounter . Halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockets would be lost and a set of highly sophisticated telemetry devices would register every mistake the agitated pilot made . Or just at the crucial moment the two main computers would blow , and every wrong move made by the pilot in the right-hand seat would be coldly registered . Engines would catch fire ; the ablative shield would burn off ; the droguep332parachute would n't pull out the main ; when Dracula was on the scene , playing his simulators like a violin , disaster was omnipresent . And when the test flight was over , he would meet with the two pilots and read them his scorecard : At 00:01:49 into the flight compression was lost . ' The bastard never said , I cut compression . ' It was always an impersonalcompression that acted poorly . The commander made two wrong responses before he hit the right one and the mission crashed . At 00:05:23 an exaggerated pogo began . Pilot attempted correction using procedure abandoned four months ago and mission crashed . ' It sometimes seemed as if Dracula could never be content until the imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when real flight began and absolutely no crisis eventuated for which Dracula had not prepared his crews , the astronauts began to generate a real affection for him . But he was , as Claggett said , a real bastard , ' which the Twins verified one morning . Dracula was a genius at devising sight-and-sound spectaculars that exactly duplicated what the astronauts would see in the flight . Motion picture cameras displayed the heavens which would surround the men at a particular moment ; the seasick motion of the descending capsule could be evoked with gimbals ; noises were easy to duplicate  --  so that by the time Claggett and Pope had flown the various simulators for well over a hundred and fifty hours , they believed with some reason that space could hold no surprises for them . In that mood they climbed into the main simulator one morning after it had been mysteriously shut down for three weeks , and as they listened to the countdown numbers coming over their earphones  --  7  --  6  --  5  --  4  --  3  --  2  --  1  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting Dracula 's next disaster . But on this day the simulator was playing for real . It blew up . There was a terrible explosion , wild noises , with flame and smoke invading the capsule as it simulated lifting into the air atop its Titan rocket . To his credit , Claggett in the left-hand seat took every step calculated to diminish the consequences of the explosion , and in his right-hand seat Pope did what he could to control the fire . The flames , from whatever cause , were extinguished , so that the simulator , badly damaged , could be repaired and used again . And then the two astronauts realized that it had all been faked . Dracula had devised a set of excellent motion pictures , a new sound system and a machine which would rock the simulator while giving off flame and smoke . At the debriefing the gloomy man droned : At 00:01:09 one of the main rockets exploded . Commander and pilot responded with all the right proceduresexcept emergency control of oxygen , so the mission crashed . ' When headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedexplosion , the latter retreated to his test-pilot training and said , I tried this and it failed . I tried step two and it failed . But step three proved effective . ' Claggett was more direct : I was scared shitless. '  |p333Senator  Grant did not propose to do the Republican dirty work on the Space Committee for the Democrats Lyndon Johnson and Michael Glancey without getting something for his state in return , but when the time came to identify the quid pro quo he ran into difficulty . Eastland of Mississippi had cornered most of the easy plums controlled by the Senate , while Mendel Rivers of South Carolina commandeered so many posts and establishments that an admiral had once growled , Mendel , if we give you one more base , Charleston will sink . ' Of the NASA assignments , Johnson was taking care of Texas , and Glancey was protecting Red River with multiple contracts . Trying to combatsuch patronage crocodiles was difficult , but Grant was not powerless , and when he threatened revolt , the Democratic leadership had to consider ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to a committee meeting , Air Force and NASA both could use another airfield west of the Missouri , and we 've decided to place it just north of your hometown . Very convenient when you get your own plane . ' Glancey also persuaded General Funkhauserto locate a branch of Allied Aviation next to the industrial city of Webster , and Grant was mollified except for one additional boon in which he had a personal interest . Glancey , our astronomer at Fremont State has talked some well-to-do people into giving us a planetarium . His name 's Anderssen , splendid scholar . I think it would be proper if this new bunch of astronauts reported there for their star studies . ' Well ... you know , Norman ... we 've been sending our men to Chapel Hill in North Carolina . They do an excellent job . ' I 'm sure they do , ' Grant said crisply , but I 'm equally sure Anderssen can do as well . ' Nothing came of this exchange , but Grant was so eager to have six astronauts walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice to the matter , and in the end Glancey surrendered : ' I ' 11 speak to NASA , ' and when those officials said that although North Carolina was doing a fine job , they could see no reason why Anderssen at Fremont State could n't do as well , the indoctrination was moved west . At his first meeting in the new planetarium the old man told the astronauts : When a man has studied the heavens for ten thousand nights he is entitled to make certain generalizations . Space is without limit or definition . There is no east or west , no north or south , no down or up , no in or out . It is truly boundless and must be respected as such . It can not be measured or comprehended . All we can do is behave in accordance with its laws as we dimly perceive them.  |p334It  is those laws I wish to speak about , and I need not exhort you to master them , for the day is not far off when you , and each of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this nation and indeed of all mankind depending upon how you perform . This is a galaxy . And he flashed on the heavens of the planetarium a stunning photograph of M-5i , the Whirlpool . There are about one billion stars in that galaxy , and about one billion galaxies in the universe as we are allowed to know it at this moment . That means that we may have as many as a billion billion different stars . I shall now increase the light so that you can write on your pads a billion billion . That 's the figure one followed by eighteen zeros . He lowered the light and showed the astronauts a beautiful photograph of the galaxy in Coma Berenices known as NGC-4565 , an elongated mass of stars and galactic dust . If we could see our Galaxy , spelled always with a capital G , from a vast distance it would look like this , a collection of some four billion stars arranged about a central core . I want each of you to guess where our Sun , one of those stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist 's conception of our Galaxy as viewed from above , and with a flashlight-pointer indicated how the Sun stood far off to one side , well away from the vital center . We are attached to a star of only average size , in a galaxy of only average size , far from the center of action where new stars are being born , far from those centers of the universe where new galaxies are being born . Never , never , young men , believe that we stand at the center of things , or even close to the center of anything . But the position we do occupy within our marvelous Galaxy is a magnificent one whose complexities will occupy you for the rest of your lives . I have spent sixty years , as a boy in Norway and an astronomer in this country , endeavoring to penetrate the mysteries of our planetary system , and I suppose I know as much about it as anyone living but I do not know its precise origin , or the construction of any component except Earth , always spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the system together , or its final destiny . I stand before you an ignorant old man terribly jealous of the astounding opportunity you have to explore our system and most eager to help you acquire the tools to accomplish that exploration . To perform your task , you must know the stars . ' The next thing he showed them , with the aid of special devices on the planetarium instrument , was the ecliptic , that arbitrary band of the heavens through which the Moon and the planets moved and along which the Sunp335appeared to move , and when this imaginary line was fixed in the men 's minds , he threw upon it handsome streamlined interpretations of the zodiacalsigns , immemorially ancient in origin , the signposts of the heavens . ' I have studied the zodiac in five different languages , and with every known mnemonic device , but a child 's rhyme fashioned in England long ago remains the best help so far devised . It 's printed in your material and I shall expect you to memorize it by tomorrow . I use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he recited the childish rhyme which helps astronomers organize their work , pointing with his light-wand to the curious collection of figures associated with the words : ' The Ram , the Bull , the Heavenly Twins . Next the Crab , and the Lion shines . The Virgin and the Scales . The Scorpion , Archer and He-Goat , Then the Man with the Watering Pot , And the Fish with the glittering scales . ' Having made the circuit once , he returned the heavens to Aries and cried , ' Now all together , ' and like a group of kindergartners , the six astronauts recited the nursery rhyme . Professor Anderssen was rigorous in demanding that the astronauts master the navigational stars situated along the ecliptic , for some of these would usually be visible , but they were not conspicuous , their names were unfamiliar , and they gave the young men much trouble : ' You simply must learn the easy ones by tomorrow . Spica , Antares , Aldebaran , Pollux , Regulus . ' When these were mastered he turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nunki in Sagittarius , easy to find in the group that looks like a Tea Kettle ; Deneb Algedi in Capricornus , not easy to find . Hamal in Aries , very difficult to find . But the most difficult of all , either to find or say , this one in Libra , Zubeneschamali . ' He was having some difficulty with Randy Claggett , who gave the star names his own pronunciation . The Big Dipper became Ursula Major , Zubeneschamaliwas Reuben Smiley , and the important navigational star Nunki became Nooki . ' Am I correct in thinking , Major Claggett , that the word Nooki has sexual overtones ? ' ' Well . . . it means . . . you 're getting some . ' ' Then I think we 'd better call that star by its right name , Nunki , ' but when in oral review Anderssen pointed his wand at Sagittarius and asked Claggett to identify the principal star , he bellowed , ' Nooki . ' For a brief spell the professor thought of disciplining the Texan , but he observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope , who had a Ph.D . in related fields , so he tolerated him , and once when he was tryingp336to teach the more difficult stars he shouted , Learn it ! It 's difficult ! It 's Reuben Smiley ! ' and the class applauded . When the northern stars were mastered , he convened his students in the planetarium and told them something they would often refer to when they talked among themselves . He was proving to be an inspired teacher , one whose obvious enthusiasm brightened his subject ; when he said that he had studied the stars for ten thousand nights he meant just that , three long nights of observation each week for sixty years : We have mastered , I think , the northern stars , the easy bright ones especially , and we have seen how fortuitous it was that God or nature placed Polaris at the precise spot where it would be most useful , at the North Pole . Now look at the South Pole and see how empty it is . Look at the entire southern hemisphere and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He allowed the sky to move slowly , majestically through three complete days , speaking a few words now and then to impress upon the men the emptiness of the southern regions and the obligation they faced of being just as familiar with these few helpful stars as with the more numerous and conspicuous ones of the north . When I was a boy in Norway and had mastered the northern stars , as you have done , I used to stand on my hill and rage at the heavens , pleading with them to shift so that I could see the southern stars , which I knew to be hidden below the horizon . " Canopus , " I shouted . " Come forth ! I know you 're down there . Southern Cross , let me see you ! " Think of it , gentlemen . We seven are among the well educated , and not one of us has ever seen the stars that guide the south . Now we shall learn them , but I can not convey how jealous of you I shall be when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and see in all their glory the southern stars which I have never seen . Quietly he moved into his heavens the Magellanic Clouds which had so captivated the Portuguese explorer , the Southern Cross which had guided and delighted Captain Cook , the brilliance of Centaurus and the cold beauty of Canopus , second brightest star in the heavens . I will expect you to know all the easy stars by tomorrow morning . Then we shall drop down to the difficult ones . ' And they were difficult : Achernar , Al Na'ir and crazy stars that not even Pope had ever heard of : Miaplacidus and Atria . But as Anderssen insisted :  |p337They  're essential because at some crucial moment up there , it may be only this part of the heavens that you will be able to see , and if you do not know these stars , you will be lost . ' In his concluding lecture , when he was satisfied that his six students had learned in their 120 hours of assigned time more than he had known at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prepared to identify the stars which will give you the data you need to navigate to the Moon , or Mars , or Jupiter . You must now move on to master the computers which will absorb these data and tell you exactly where you are . But in a larger sense , none of us will ever know where we are . We are lost in the stars , in our little Galaxy , among the billions of other galaxies that help to control us within a universe we can neither define nor comprehend . The steps you brave young men take with your marvelous machines will push back the veil of ignorance a little way , and then our concern will be with the newly revealed and greater ignorances which will dominate us until others like you , with their own machines and understandings , push their veils aside to reveal the new imponderables . How I envy you . ' Tucker Thompson was enjoying such a great run with the six astronauts that his magazine advertised his work as a better job than Life , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folks , each man stood to make about $23,000 extra income if the series was sold abroad . The fliers therefore worked closely with Tucker and encouraged their wives to do the same , but all of the women resented Thompson 's invasion of their privacy , and he had some trouble getting them to do the things that the American public had a right to expect of their heroines . Thompson had particular cause to worry about Cocoa Beach , the explosivetown to the south of Canaveral which had once contained 2,600 people and would soon have many times that number . Never a pretty town , in the old days it had served as a winter resort for snow-birds who flocked south each December from places like Maine , Minnesota and especially Ontario . Those with wealth continued on to Palm Beach , a hundred and twenty-five miles farther south ; only those on budgets parked their caravans at Cocoa Beach . The houses tended to be one story , frame , unheated and dusty , the stores two-storied and jumbled . There had been bars , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a small permanent population whose men commuted to jobs north along the coast to Daytona Beach or inland to Orlando . Like Canaveral itself , the little town huddled on the outer chain ofp338islands and expanded not like a lovely rose which flowered in all directions , but rather like a radish which elongated at each end but stayed the same in the restricted middle . Yet the town had a wild beauty , for to the east roared the somber Atlantic . When the astronauts flew in to Cape Canaveral on duty assignments , which was constantly , austere bachelor quarters were provided in NASA buildings , but they preferred the livelier scene at Cocoa Beach , twenty miles to the south , and if they brought their wives along , which they often did , it became the custom for them to take rooms at a new and glossy motel called the Bali Hai , a name borrowed by many joints across the country from a popular song that was supposed to be tropical and sexy . This Bali Hai had been built by Canadians , who seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to become popular next , but it was run by a pessimistic married couple from Maine who had spent one winter too many among the snowdrifts of that igloo . They were the Quints , named after the Dionnes , ' they told guests who had never heard of the famous Canadian sisters , and in one way they were ill-prepared for the high nonsense that preempted their motel , for they were dour Yankees ; but in another , they were a good choice , because in Maine they had spent their long winters studying wildlife and had learned that animals , four-footed or two- , are capable of damned near anything . ' The Bali Hai had three considerable assets : a white beach from which the husbands could plunge into the high waves of the Atlantic , a blue-tiled swimming pool shaded by palm trees in which the wives could disport , and a large dark bar in which both could celebrate . The walls of the Dagger Bar were tastefully decorated with daggers , swords , knives , sabers , cutlasses , krisses , poniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them contributedby well-traveled patrons who had brought them home from foreign ports . The effect was quite stunning , a congenial bar with inviting tables surrounded by weaponry which recalled the violence of the world and reminded the drinkers of the violence which had sometimes threatened their lives . About the room evocative objects hauled in from the Bahamas were placed : large clamshells , fishing nets , green-glass floats used by fishermen , and two gigantic stuffed swordfish . The Dagger Bar featured rum drinks with exotic names like Missionary 's Downfall or Virgin 's Last Stand and an excellent fish dinner for a flat three dollars including one free beer . Each new group of astronauts was advised by those who had gone before : The scene is at the Dagger Bar . You 'll love the Quints , gloomiest people since Cotton Mather . But those fresh oysters , all you can eat for fifty cents ! ' Tucker Thompson , anticipating that his crowd would want to lodge at the Bali Hai , checked the place out and satisfied himself that the rooms were clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent icicles right up his spine : the Bali Hai was sometimes overrun by hordesp339of groupies who wanted to be where the action was , and since many of them were delectable and still in their teens , he could foresee disaster . The Cocoa Beach groupies following space were identical with the girls of Europe who idolized bullfighters , those of South America who traipsed after race-car drivers , or those of Canada who chased hockey players . All societies appeared to produce a plethora of young girls eager for excitement and willing to break away from stable homes in order to seek it . And around the world they behaved the same : frequent the scene of action , haunt the popular bars , and jump into the right bed with practiced alacrity . Rachel Mott , observing the phenomenon for the first time , was appalled by the undisciplined behavior of her sex ; it was really quite shameless the way the girls threw themselves at the men , but when Tucker Thompson asked about it one night in the Dagger Bar while five or six toothsome girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Randy Claggett , she admitted grudgingly , I 've been quite shocked by these children . Where are their parents ? But upon reflection , I 've had to conclude that girls just like these probably haunted the camps where the gladiators trained , and on the day when the little men descend from another planet , a supply of our girls will be there to greet them . ' Well , they 've got to lay off my astronauts , ' Thompson said , or we 're going to look like fools . ' And he showed the Motts his magazine 's next week 's issue , in which his long-range program for the Special Group was revealed . It displayed on the cover , in the neatest possible array , the new astronauts , each man looking right into the camera with chin set , eyes ablaze and hair cut short , Marine style . THE SOLID SIX cried the headline , and Thompson sat back highly pleased with his work . In our business , ' he said , the battle 's half won if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bomber made Joe Louis twice the man he would have been otherwise . The Lone Eagle  --  nobody ever did better than that . It made the public see Lindbergh , who was not an easy man to sell , as both aloof and particularized , almost human , you could say . I like that one they 've started using for Brooks Robinson  --  the Glove . That 's classy . And I liked the Velvet Fog , the name they gave Mel Torme when they discovered he could n't reach the hard notes . Saved his career . But the best they ever did was for that likable London heavyweight who came over here , to disastrous results . Phil Scott , his name was , and when he was knocked flat three times by punkos even before the big fight and all seemed lost , some clown gave him the name Phainting Phil , the Swooning Swan of Soho , and thousands paid to see him . ' The Solid Six , ' Mott repeated . It has a good sound , and they certainly look solid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the final choice was n't mine . The whole board wrestled with this one . Our thinking was that Life had pretty well preempted the field of glamour with their crews . Glenn , Bor/man , Shepard . That 's a pretty classy group . Did you know that some people are now calling the original astronauts the Sacred Seven ? Well , we could n't replay that record , but we could identify our men with something patriotic and lasting . ' He stopped to make an entirely different point : The lasting part is important . Because our boys are going to be on the scene for a long , long time . The Sacred Seven are dropping away like flies . . . private business ... all that . It will be our boys who make the great Gemini flights , the ones who 'll later fly the Apollos to the Moon . ' He drummed on the table , then looked past Rachel Mott to where the teenage groupies were still making a fuss over Claggett . We blow the solid bit if any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussing about the fact that we have an exclusive , and if they could blast us out of the sky with a juicy scandal , they 'd descend on us like hungry wolves . ' He stopped , looked at Mott and asked , Did I mix my metaphors ? ' You did , ' Rachel said . Forgive it . Point is , Mott , I want you to talk with your boys . ' Problem 's not mine . ' You bet your sweet ass it is , ' Thompson said sharply . Excuse me , ma'am , but this is important . Mrs. Mott , here , is doing a great job with the girls . You keep the boys in line . ' He was so insistent and so irritated with Mott for not assessing the danger seriously , that he got in touch with his superiors at Folks and they called Senator Grant , who seemed to be the Senate spokesman for the space exercises , and he telephoned Cocoa Beach immediately : Mott , Tucker Thompson is dead right . It would be disastrous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Pass the word . ' Senator , I ca n't  --  ' His protest was not allowed . Those lads are your responsibility , Mott . Pass the word ! ' Mott waited till all the men were at Canaveral , for he did not want to discharge this messy task piecemeal , and the delay proved almost fatal , for a persistent teenager from Columbus , Missouri , the daughter of a professor no less , forced her way into Randy Claggett 's bedroom while he was working in one of the simulators at the Cape and was waiting for him , undressed , in bed when he returned to the Bali Hai . Randy did not feel obligated to force the girl from his bed , or even to make her put her clothes back on , but when he told her at half past nine that he really must go down for some supper and that she could not walk down with him , she understood and used a fire escape . Tucker Thompson watched the way they came straggling in from two different directions , painstakingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and sat together for a huge plate of oysters and two bowls of chili , and he was positive that his carefully orchestrated plan for his six astronauts was on the verge of destruction . Looking hastily about the darkened room to seep341if any newsmen had witnessed the sexual charade , he was relieved to find that all of them were absent , attending a briefing at the Cape regarding the impending second Gemini shot in which the popular Edward White was going to walk in space . But even as he took a deep breath he saw at a corner table a compelling young Japanese woman , not yet thirty , small , exquisitely framed , with becoming bangs , high cheekbones and just a hint of Asia in her eyes . Her complexion was that delicate coloring which appears on the finest celadon vases of the Orient , smooth and placid , and she seemed the kind of woman with whom any responsive man would want to discuss his troubles . Also , she wore that special combination of informal clothing which invited men to approach her table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tan colors that matched her skin , a casual sweater thrown carelessly about her shoulders , a very wide belt emphasizing the smallness of her waist , a free-swinging skirt and Italian-style loafers with broad , blunt toes . As soon as Tucker saw her , warning bells started ringing : That one is no groupie . She 's for real . But what truly terrified him was the fact that from her corner , under the Malayan daggers which framed her lovely square face with its sensuous drooping mouth , she was watching with professional cynicism everything Randy Claggett and his teenage supper companion were doing and was occasionally writing in a notebook . Who 's that ? ' Thompson asked . The woman in the corner ? ' Mrs. Mott asked . She 's an accredited reporter from Japan . Well regarded in the profession . Did a stint with the New York Times . Got an M.A. with top grades from Radcliffe . Now writes for the Asahi Shimbun , biggest paper in the world , and is syndicated in Europe . ' What 's a Japanese doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about space . Has a real feeling for it . Has a pilot 's license , I believe , and she did a lot of glider soaring in New Hampshire when she was at Radcliffe . ' What 's her name ? She 's not on my list . ' Yes she is , ' Rachel said with some embarrassment . She 's the one we thought was a Japanese man . Rhee Soon-Ka . Rhee 's the last name . When I went to meet Mr. Rhee  --  voila ! ' And she pointed to the lovely young woman taking notes under the Malayan daggers . ' A Japanese ! ' Thompson growled . Emperor Hirohito would do anything to get even . ' Tucker , take it easy ! ' He could not . He had lost too many battles with the press not to recognize an enemy when he saw one , and knew intuitively that he would find himself , during the next decade , doing continuous battle with Madame Fu Manchu . You say she worked for the New York Times ? ' ' An exchange job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't learn in Japan , I 'm sure she picked up in New York . ' A flash of genius struck him : Do you think I could go over and strangle her right now ? ' Tucker ! She 's a woman doing a job . She does n't weigh more than a hundred pounds . ' A cobra does n't weigh six . ' He studied the intruder for several minutes , then rose abruptly and walked to her table . I 'm Tucker Thompson , Folks . ' I know , ' she said in a lilting voice . Sit down . You 're the one who keeps the six little Boy Scouts locked up . ' It 's our job to write about them . ' You do n't seem to have that one behind bars , ' she said , pointing to Claggett . His niece , from Kansas . ' Popes used to have nieces . Astronauts have pickups . ' You write one word .. I intend to write about sixty thousand words . ' You be careful .. It 's your job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales . It 's mine to provide the rest of the world with adult interpretations . ' You be very careful .. I do n't have to be . I 'm not trying to sell anything . Tonight I 'm taking notes on a most attractive young man , a most lecherous one . ' Now , Miss . . . ' He hesitated . What 's your name ? ' Born Rhee Soon-Ka . In America , I use Cynthia Rhee . ' As a Japanese alien , you could find yourself in a lot of trouble , Miss Rhee . ' I 'm Korean . ' Just as bad . I have the power to cause you a lot of trouble . ' Have you chanced to read my series on the Kremlin ? I 'm always in trouble . You get fine stories when you place yourself in harm 's way , as your Admiral John Paul Jones so handsomely phrased it . ' She spoke a beautiful , halting English , so carefully pronounced that it stung and infuriated , and she was not even trivially disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of luck with your story , Miss Rhee , ' he said as he rose to depart . And you will do everything possible to prevent me from getting it . ' With my six astronauts , I will . ' And they happen to be the very six about whom I am writing . ' And without referring to her notes , she recited the names in order : Randy Claggett of Texas , wife Debby Dee . Hickory Lee of Tennessee and his wife Sandy . Timothy Bell of Arkansas and his wife Cluny . Harry Jensen of South Carolina and his pretty wife Inger . Ed Cater of Mississippi and his wife Gloria . And perhaps the most interesting of all , John Pope of Fremont and his ambitious wife Penny . You 'll be reading about them , Mr. Tucker . ' When Thompson returned to his table he received the harshest shockp343of all , delivered by Rachel Mott : ' She 's supposed to have said in the bar that in order to complete her research , she intended to sleep with every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , ' The Solid Six , as you describe them . ' The urgent meeting was held in Thompson 's room at the Bali Hai , and although he had originally intended for Stanley Mott to carry the ball , he could not refrain from getting immediately to the heart of the crisis . ' Men , it 's very simple . If you besmirch the name of astronaut with cheap sexual adventures , you endanger a program of vital importance to the nation and to the world . ' The listeners could see that he was sweating , and as they wondered what he would say next , he added , Rumors are circulating . I myself have seen things that would have looked damned suspicious to a knowing reporter . ' He really did not know how to proceed past that point , so he shifted gears completely . ' You stand to lose a great deal of money , all of you , if this thing blows up . ' And as soon as he uttered these words , he knew he had blown it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most nubile young women in the world simply because a monetary contract was in danger ? Mott took over . ' Senator Grant just telephoned me . He 's responsible for the funds you fellows spend in your T-38s . He 's got to wangle through Congress the billion-odd dollars for your Gemini program . ' He stopped and laughed at himself . How in hell do you say that word ? I hear it four ways . Hard G. Soft J. Dictionary says it ends - eye . NASA uses - ee . ' Ed Cater said , Our radio station has an astrology program and they give it the hard G and the - eye . ' ' I would despise taking my intellectual leadership from an astrology program . Forgive me if I call it Jem-in-ee . ' With the tension broken , Thompson adopted a different tone . Men , the Senate leaders , the NASA leadership , all of us want to see this program move forward in an orderly way . You know you 're already being ticketed for future flights , ones of profound significance . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interrupted by a hard , flat , unemotional voice ; it belonged to John Pope . ' If you 're talking about sex , say so . ' ' That 's exactly what we 're talking about , ' Thompson snapped . ' If you men allow yourselves to get mixed up with those groupies .. Pope was inflexible . ' It 's highly improper for you to come here and lecture us on such a subject . We 're not Boy Scouts . ' ' The public thinks you are . ' ' Maybe that 's because of what your magazine writes , Mr. Thompson . ' ' We write what America needs to hear . ' ' We 're test pilots . Each of us had to decide long ago how we 'd behave.  |p344So  far we 've done a pretty good job , and frankly , we do not seek high-school counseling now . ' The words were so unexpected , and from a source so surprising , that Mott made no effort to respond ; these were not the statements of some young astronaut , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Tucker Thompson was not silenced , because he was custodian of property rights which must be protected . Do n't take this too lightly . There 's a newswoman in these parts who 's announced publicly that she 's going to sleep with every one of you , then write a book about your perfor-mances . ' Some of the men gasped , but the effect Thompson sought was dissipated when the husky voice of Randy Claggett whispered , Get that girl 's full name and address . ' When the NASA high command learned through its grapevine of the threat posed by Cynthia Rhee , they gave Tucker Thompson a clear directive : Get that Korean reporter straightened out , ' but Tucker , remembering his first encounter with her , knew that he was not the man for that job . Calling Mrs. Mott to his room at the Bali Hai , he said , Ride herd on our Miss Kimchi . ' Who 's that ? ' Impatiently Thompson explained : Kimchi is the smellingest coleslaw in the world , and the bitingest . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twice as obnoxious . You 're to tell her what 's what . She 's to lay off our astronauts . ' Rachel laughed . What an unfortunate use of words , Tucker . Lay off . ' It 's your paycheck if she gets out of line . ' So Rachel went to the Dagger Bar , where Miss Rhee was sitting alone at her customary table in the rear . Walking up to her , Rachel said , May I join you ? ' Has Mr. Thompson ordered you to check on me ? ' the Korean woman asked with transparent insolence . He did just that , ' Rachel snapped , grabbing at a chair and pulling herself up to the table . I 've been informed that men at the bar heard you boast that you were going to sleep with each of our astronauts . What a vile thing to have said . ' To her surprise , the Korean woman lost all belligerence . Like an autumnsunrise a warm smile spread over her beautiful face and she placed her small , well-tended hands over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread such rumors when they feel challenged by women who are brighter than they are . ' Do you challenge them ? ' I certainly do . Men like your Mr. Thompson have been getting away with murder ... the bullshit they write about the astronauts . ' Do you have to use such words ? '  |p345That  word is the only one which describes what the men writers around here have been throwing into the wind . ' And you intend to correct that ? ' I surely do . ' She leaned back against the wall to study Mrs. Mott . You know , of course , that I 'm extremely pleased to have you here at my table . I 've been wondering how I might meet you . ' Why ? ' You 're just as much a part of my story as Randy Claggett . ' I 'm surprised , ' Rachel said . Do n't be . Your husband is a prime part of NASA , and to understand him , I must understand you . ' And to keep you from wrecking things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm relatively simple . Fiercely oriented . Self-controlled . But never com-plex . ' Tell me , ' Rachel said , and the sincerity in her voice encouraged the Asian woman to confide : Because I was born at the right time , in 1936 , I profited from the groundwork done by the great women journalists who preceded me . Simone de Beauvoir , Dorothy Thompson , and especially the three younger Americans of the postwar period . I have no illusions that I 'm as good as they were , but I am their inheritor and I intend to send my profession forward , as they did . ' When Rachel said , Tell me about the three Americans , ' Cynthia replied , A woman like you ought to know about them , ' and Rachel said , There 's a great deal I do n't know . ' The significant fact is , they 're all dead . Each one killed herself at the extremes of her profession , and I suppose I 'll do the same . Maggie Higgins worked herself to death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parachuting behind enemy lines , submarining in dangerous waters , leading a patrol of Marines with flame-throwers , and finally blowing herself to fragments on a land mine in Vietnam . Nell Nevler , as you know , plunged to a shattering death when the Russian transport in which she and her Russian colonel were escaping plunged into the Kiev airport . They were brave women , brilliant women , who established new freedoms , who redefined how women could be employed . That they performed well in the 195os enabled me to try my hand in the 1970s , and I assure you that I do not intend to be a lesser woman than they were . '  |p346When  Rachel probed as to what her intentions were with the Solid Six , Cynthia laughed . Who knows ? When NASA launches a satellite , who can certify where it will head ? Many have gone their own ways , to the consternationof your bright boys in Houston . Same thing happens when you launch a person with ideas at a target with emotional content . Who can anticipate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Cynthia added what was perhaps the most relevant in all that she had revealed : In comparison with the women I 've mentioned , I consider myself rather limited , but I do have one thing none of them did . I 'm driven by a compulsive force you would not believe . You see , I 'm a Korean brought up in Japan , where Koreans are treated like dirt . And that 's a furnace which forges a special kind of steel  --  flexible . . . keen ... indestructible . I 'm like a sword of the Japanese samurai , whom I detest but also admire . Their swords cut to the quick of things , and I do the same . ' When Rachel looked up she saw Tucker Thompson approaching the table . And how are you two girls getting along ? ' And Rachel thought : What an unequal battle this is going to be ! The Korean karate champ versus the Madison Avenue hack , but later , when she had watched how adroitly Tucker protected himself in the dirty infighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneven as she had thought . John Pope 's blunt defense of the right of his fellow astronauts to behave without supervision by NASA and Folks had several repercussions . The five other astronauts , knowing him to be a rather stuffy straight arrow who never dallied with the groupies , were impressed by his willingness to defend them on a matter of principle , and they appreciated this . They had already elevated Randy Claggett to the position of master pilot , and now they conferred on Pope the unannounced title of political leader . This gave him no added perquisites , only additional responsibilities , but when difficult problems arose , or confrontations with the high command , they expected him to make the first statements and then to defend them . It was not a position he sought , nor one that gained him ease ; observed behavior among one 's peers accounted for it , and a herd of cattle in a meadow or a flight of geese at sunset will make the same kind of election for the same kind of reason . It was perplexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not especially like him ; he was too rigid , too much an overage Cub Scout , far too much a loner . He did not drink or smoke ; he quarantined himself from the groupies ; and while the other astronauts lounged in the Dagger Bar , he was apt to be on the beach , running six or seven miles to keep thep347fat down . This separation of Pope from the rest did not mean that the latter conformed to the pattern of Randy Claggett , with his wild and sometimes crazy Texas ways . The normative astronaut was Hickory Lee : quiet , fearfullyefficient , solid drinker off duty , quick to anger if his rights were trespassed , and average in almost every other human reaction . Pope and Claggett stood at the extremes ; Hickory commanded the middle . For two reasons the NASA brass were not happy with Pope 's outspoken defiance of Stanley Mott and Tucker Thompson : they had carefully cultivatedthe myth that the astronauts were almost heavenly creatures  --  ' a cross between Jesus Christ , Ulysses and Joe DiMaggio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously from it ; they must preserve this myth unsullied ; and they had entered into a contract with Folks whereby it and Thompson enjoyed special privileges , and to have him rebuffed so harshly was distasteful . So for some weeks , until it became clear that the Twins were not going to continue any rebellion which might endanger the great project of ultimately placing a man on the Moon , Pope and Claggett were looked upon with suspicion . The astronauts maintained a careful balance between rigorous attention to detail and rowdy relaxation , and one afternoon , following an informal meeting with the press , five of them huddled around a corner table in the Dagger Bar , conducting a noisy debate concerning where , during a journey to the Moon , Earth 's gravity ceased to exercise dominance and Moon 's took over . Preposterous guesses circulated , after which Hickory Lee banged his beer glass and cried , Pope , you studied astronomy . Where is the break-even point ? ' John did not know , but across the room he spotted Stanley Mott and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was given  --  220,000 miles from Earth , 19,000 miles from the Moon  --  Mott lingered to check on how his young men were doing , and he was pleased . But as he talked with the five he noticed that they were looking over his shoulder at someone who had just entered . It was Tim Bell , the civilian , fresh from the barber , who had given him an especially sharp haircut . It made Bell , always studiously neat , seem even more handsome than usual , a fact which the young man was approving as he looked at himself in the mirror . Mott was perplexed when Claggett whispered , Let 's give him the haircut routine . ' The five young men rose and walked casually across the room toward where Bell was admiring himself , and as Mott watched them go he felt pride in being associated with them . Slim of hip , broad of shoulder and slightly underweight , they created a trim appearance , and because of the press meeting , each was still dressed in a dark suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe V that nestled neatly within the collar . What differentiated them were their shoes , each having chosen a style which best reflected his way of life . Claggett wore Texas hoots , tall and limber . Harry Jensen had chosen French-style pumps with extremely thin soles . Pope , ofp348course , preferred the 1920 wingtip decorated with little holes punched in the leather to make artistic patterns . And each of the others had his own unique wear , always highly polished . What made them appear the same , like five clones of the one ideal astronaut , were their watches , each man wearing on his left wrist a chronograph , immensely big , heavy and expensive . It told local time , Greenwich Mean Time on the twenty-four-hour system , the day of the week , the month , the phase of the Moon , and served also as a stopwatch , lap timer and alarm clock . Hickory Lee said of his , I had more trouble learning how to work this monster than I did with advanced calculus at MIT . ' For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of the barroom into an aureole of sunlight coming through a western window , they looked as if nature itself were applauding their excellence , and Mott wondered if anywhere else in America there was assembled a more attractivegroup . But when he looked again they had passed on , and surrounded Bell as if they intended to beat him up . Bell ! ' Claggett said with a rush of emotion . We 've decided to stand with you , no matter what . ' Ed Cater took him by the arm and said confidentially , At first we thought you might be a jerk , but you 've shown us you can fly with the best . I 'm going to back you all the way . ' Jensen said brightly , Call on me , Tim , whenever you need help . As for right now , you say the word and we 'll move out . ' What 's this all about ? ' Bell asked nervously . That haircut , ' Claggett said . We 're ready right now to go in town and beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Bell smiled weakly , suspecting correctly that the horseplay had something to do with his not belonging to the military . Mott , watching the nonsense , experienced an intense desire to see his own son , who had elected a course so different from that chosen by these young gods , and that night he confessed to his wife : I 've been doing a great deal of thinking , Rachel . About Millard and us . And the fact that we 'd allowed his life style to drive a wedge between us . ' His voice quavered and tears threatened . What is it , dear ? ' Working with these young men , day after day . . . It 's made me hungry to see our boy . I do n't give a damn how he 's living or what other people think . He 's our son , and I see now that we 're obligated to stay with him , hell or high water . ' Rachel bowed her head to hide her own tears , then muttered , You may be right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters for permission , next time I 'm in California . Three-day leave to visit with Millard . ' To what purpose ? '  |p349No  purpose . No purpose in God 's world . I just want to see him and let him know we love him . ' Stifled sobs prevented Rachel from speaking , but after a long interval during which she blew her nose twice , she laughed nervously , then said softly , It 's strange , you know , speaking about how your work with the six men has affected you . I see their wives day after day , and I suppose I know everything that 's wrong with every one of them . But do you know what ? I 'd be overjoyed to have any one of them as a daughter-in-law . I wish to God that Millard would marry someone like them . ' Apparently that 's not going to be , and frankly , I no longer give a damn . As Pope said the other morning , " We do not seek counsel from you . " Millard 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to adjust . ' Even though we despise the decision ? ' Yes . We must keep in contact with our son . No matter what he does . ' During the next visit of the astronauts to check on progress at Allied Aviation , Mott slipped away , rented a car and drove to Malibu Beach , where with the help of a girl in a bikini he found the cottage occupied by Millard and a young man from Indiana named Roger . Millard , taller than his father , no glasses , very slim , very tanned , appeared to be in excellent health . He wore his hair much longer than did the astronauts and apparently he owned no socks , for during their entire visit together his father never saw him in any . The son , supposing that his father had come to lecture him , was decidedlycool at first , while Roger was openly defensive , but as the afternoon passed with no lectures , the atmosphere eased , and by the time Stanley invited the young men to have dinner with him , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had brought him to their cottage . At first the talk centered on the astronauts . Are they really as . . . ' Young Mott did not know how to finish his question without insulting his father , and there was an awkward pause . As square as they seem ? ' Stanley suggested , and when the young men laughed , he raised three fingers and said , Eagle Scouts , word of honor . Millard , you would not believe how square these fellows are . ' To what purpose ? ' Every time they go aloft they lay their lives on the line . One slip and they 're dead . They need discipline . ' They 've had no accidents yet . Are n't you overplaying it ? ' The accidents will come . But they 'll forge ahead . And one of these days they 'll stand on the Moon . ' ' As I said , to what purpose ? ' Stanley Mott spoke very carefully . Because that 's the job they 've given themselves . That 's their scene , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , he added , trying to sound casual , The way you men have worked out your own scene . '  |p350Silence  . So he added , offhandedly , I respect the astronauts ' choice . I respect yours . ' And before either young man could respond , he launched hurriedly into a recitation of what the astronauts had to know before they could participate in a space flight : Math , vector analysis , orbital mechanics , computers , rocket engines , the characteristics of three hypergolic fuels , digital systems , radio , television and another ten or eleven really tough fields . ' You make them sound like geniuses , ' Roger said . He had been unable to master algebra . Let me tell you a funny thing , Roger . What I 've just recited are the basic fields . When they get through them , then they begin the hard work . Tracing out the particular systems of their particular spacecraft . The manuals , eight and a half by eleven , typewriter size , stand this high . ' And with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for his listeners to absorb that staggering fact . The other day I saw two of the men running to a class , and they were on a slanting surface so that their heads were tilted to the left , and I had this crazy feeling : They better stop that or the knowledge will spill out their ear . They must have , right now , as much information in their heads as the human brain can accommodate . They must be among the brightest men on Earth . ' He paused , then concluded : Maybe only squares would be solid enough to absorb so much without going nuts . Maybe they have to be square . ' The young men nodded , and Roger smoothed the expensive cashmere sweater he was wearing . Another round ? ' Mott asked , but no one wanted any further drinks , so the waitress brought the food , a delicious seafood salad with Italian garlic bread and iced tea . As they ate , Millard said cautiously , Back there you said something about life styles . ' Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job , you know . ' I did n't know . ' He took off his glasses , wiped his tired eyes , and said , I 'm delighted , Millard . What 's it deal with ? ' Now that 's odd , ' Millard replied . You ask " What 's it deal with ? " as if the job itself was more important than the man doing the job . ' Habit of speech , I guess . ' But Millard would not let his father off the hook so easily . If I told you that I had a job which sounded important . Computers . Plastic forms . Damned near anything mechanical . You 'd be proud , and you could say offhandedly at the country club , " My boy Millard 's into computers . " Well , your boy Millard 's into nurses ' helper in a children 's hospital . And so is Roger . ' Damned good public service , ' Mott said . We think so , ' his son said defiantly . In the normal swing of events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I can see . It 's a way of life for the present , and where anything leads to I have n't a clue . ' Go with the flow ? ' Mott asked . Yes . ' This required no further comment , so after a while Mott said brightly , as if opening a completely new subject , Your mother and I are eager to maintain contact , Millard . If your work ever brings you back East . . . or vacations . . . you must stay with us . You , too , Roger . ' You wo n't shoot me ? ' Roger asked . Why would you say that ? ' Because if I went home to Indiana , my father would shoot me . Especiallyif I took your son with me . ' Four months ago I 'd have shot you . But now .. What happened ? ' Roger asked , boring in . My work with the new astronauts . I 'm sort of their den mother . They 've moved me deeply . Made me see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although as you implied a while back , they seem at first like paper cutouts . So different . ' And ? ' I saw human capacities , human variations if you will  --  I saw the whole ball game in a different light . And I felt driven to tell you so , Millard . ' This is a very good salad , ' his son said . Would you like to hear what my father said in those circumstances ? ' Roger asked . I would . ' He 's a minor official at the raceway . Very gung ho . When he heard how I was living he blew a gasket . Said if I ever let anyone at the raceway know what I was doing , he 'd kill me . So I laughed and asked him , " Who do you think were the first two men I slept with ? " And he damn near fainted when I told him , giving names , " Two of your best drivers . " He screamed , " I 'll kill them , " but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill them . Father is very strong on killing people . His father was a leading figure in the days when the Klan ran the state . ' What do young men like you ... ' Mott was embarrassed at having used such a cliche phrase , but he could think of no circumlocution . How do you envisage the future ? ' We do n't , ' Roger said . But Millard 's mother and I  --  we look forward to gainful occupation till I 'm sixty-five . Then forced retirement ... then a reduced standard of living . Grandchildren to occupy us . One of us dies . . . we all die . An orderly progression , you might say . ' A statistical one , ' Roger said . Statistics surely govern your situation , too . ' The young men did not care to discuss the probabilities which dictated their lives , but throughout the remainder of this first evening they talkedp352freely of their jobs at the hospital and of the kinds of work beachboys were able to get . Roger said , The post office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Stanley Mott spent two fascinating days with his son , discussing things he would never have imagined possible . As a straight arrow he could not approve of any deviation from the norm ; indeed , a straight arrow was a man who defined the norm . But as a human being whose parameters of vision and understanding were being expanded by the expanding age in which he played a central role , he could appreciate the tangled drives , so unlike his own , which motivated these two young men . Do you find any satisfaction in what you do ? ' Roger asked on the last evening . Each day is a new beginning , an overwhelming challenge . ' Like what ? ' You know , I did n't take my doctorate  --  an entirely new field  --  till I was forty-four . Celestial mechanics . That wakes a man up . ' So what are you doing with it now ? ' NASA assigns me to one committee after another . Where I can apply what I 've learned . ' Like what ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , listen for about an hour ? ' Test me . ' So Mott took a large sheet of paper , and with the exquisite line and lettering he had mastered at Georgia Tech in Drafting II , drew a schematic of the solar system , naming the Sun at the left hand and the Earth fairly close in , but not naming what he called the nine other wanderers . ' Can you tell me how to name them ? ' he asked , and neither of his listeners could . So starting close to the Sun he printed the names : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , Pluto . That 's only nine planets , ' Roger said . You just said there were nine besides Earth . ' I think of the collection of asteroids as a planet , ' Mott said . One that broke into fragments , from one cause or another . They hide between Mars and Jupiter . ' When the young men finished studying the diagram , Mott said , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand tour . " There used to be a time when young Englishmen of good family were not considered educated until they completed a grand tour of Paris , Geneva and Rome , with maybe a stopover in barbarian Germany . Long after the Moon shot is history , we propose to launch a single space vehicle which will take off from Florida , and move purposefully past all the other planets . Its course could be something like this . ' And with the most careful strokes of his pen , making never a mistake or a strikeover , he sketched a majestic itinerary , twisting and winding among the planets , sometimes turning in unexpected ways and leaping offp353into unexpected directions . When he finished his diagram he said , simply , ' If we 're able to start this tour in 1970 , we 'll end it with our craft heading past Pluto and out to the remote stars of our Galaxy sometime about 1997 . It 'll wander among those near stars for about four million years , then leave for the remote galaxies , and after about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You speak of it as if it was immortal . ' ' It will be . No atmosphere to disturb it . No moisture to rust it . No burning fuel to clog the pipes . Only the perpetual journey . ' How will you know it 's still on its journey ? ' Mott pointed to the single light that illuminated the cottage and said , ' It will carry a device which generates electricity from radioactivity . This will activate a radio that will send us messages . . . one-tenth of the power of that little bulb . But it will penetrate the billion miles separating us from Saturn as if that planet were next door . It 'll require ninety minutes for us to receive the message , of course , and when the grand tour reaches Pluto , nearly five billion miles away , it 'll take nearly four hours . . . electrical impulses coming to us at the speed of light , and when the craft reaches the edge of our Galaxy its messages will require thousands of years to reach us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men contemplated this for a while , then Millard asked , But how does the spacecraft get its power to keep moving outward ? ' ' We start it with a good boost at Cape Canaveral . And we head it with great precision , so that every time it encounters a planet , it does so in a way to pick up energy from the rotation of that planet about the Sun  --  sort of like the last child at the end of a crack-the-whip  --  and this throws the craft sharply onward to the next planet in line . ' You can schedule it so exactly ? ' Roger asked . Almost to the second , ' Mott said . Almost to the mile . ' ' And that 's what you 're doing . . . when you 're not baby-sitting ? ' Yes . ' And on a separate sheet of paper he drew a beautiful depiction of the planet Saturn , with its rings handsomely inclined and its ten known moons depicted , and what he now told the men paved the way for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm low man on the totem pole working on this , is to bring our craft toward Saturn on this kind of heading on a specified day in , say , August 1981 , when the exact location of Saturn and its moons has been determined . ' ' You like to use the word exact , do n't you ? ' ' If data can be known , they should be used . ' ' And you know where Saturn will be ? ' ' Kepler and Newton taught us how to know . ' ' And from a distance of a billion miles you 're going to pilot your tiny craft so that it threads its way past the moons and the rings . ' ' That 's exactly what we 're going to do . ' ' How ? '  |p354Newton  once said that if he could see great distances , which he could , it was only because he stood on the shoulders of giants  --  the brilliant men like Kepler who went before him . We can solve the mechanical riddles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic work before us . We will lead that spacecraft here and here and here and here , and we will make not one damned mistake . ' He spoke with such fury , such iron-hard determination , that his listenersdared not make snide attacks on his beliefs , and after they had sat for some time in the near-darkness , Mott said , The grand tour requires an infinity of calculations  --  where every planet and every moon will be down to the minute and the second . Then we must work backward to a specific two-week period , and within each twenty-four hours we will have a launch window of exactly  --  there 's that word again  --  four minutes and nine seconds . We 're going to penetrate the remotest corners of the universe , and we have four minutes and nine seconds to do it in . ' No comment , and then he said , The point is , for Johannes Kepler to calculate the orbit of one planet required mathematical equations and solutionscovering papers this high  --  ten years of solid work . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I 'm doing has nothing to do with the Moon or Saturn . I 'm building for the clowns who 'll be trying things in the next century . And there will never be an end . ' He had no more to say , nor did the young men . The three of them sat there , looking at the incredible diagrams , listening to the noisy surf , and after a long while Roger said , At dinner last night you told us that you and your wife lived in a situation governed by statistics . The mortality tables say you 'll live to age seventy-nine , then kaput . I refused to admit that Millard and I also fall into the middle of statistical predictions . We do . ' It was approaching midnight , and now Roger wanted to talk . At nineteenyou 're a young god . You can handle any breaking wave . Girls stop to look as you pass , and men too . Those are the golden years . Christ , you can do anything , write any rules . The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities in so many fields , you get dizzy . Beach houses everywhere . Girls with convertibles . Men with high salaries . California sunshine . You can not imagine how good these years can be . And no responsibility  --  except to pray that the nuclear bomb does n't swoop down to wipe it all away before you 've finished with your fun . From what I 've watched , the numbers begin to tell at about forty , and at fifty you 're a real statistic . I 'll probably continue lucky and find someone to share a house with , and our salaries , too . Or maybe I 'll escort women without husbands , women who can help me pay my bills . I 'll have a steady job , I suppose , but I do n't look forward to that , and if I 'm still as strongly sexed as I am now , I 'll have trouble finding partners , because I know I 'll never be rich . I 'm not built that way . But I 'll get along . And at sixty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and God knows what I 'll do . But I 'll survive . And if I 'm lucky enough to have found an excellent person likep355your son , we 'll live where it 's warm and collect social security . Then our problem becomes identical with yours , Dr. Mott . Find a place to live , enough to eat on , and an orderly burial when we die . ' To Stanley Mott 's surprise , his son now said with quiet vigor , almost accusingly , Dad , you watch what happens to your godlike astronauts . I 've seen a lot of retired Army and Navy people in this part of California , and I can tell you with certainty what it 's going to be . You have six under your wing . Two will be killed young . Two will be divorced and marry girls twenty years younger . One of the others will quit the program , go into business , and become an alcoholic . And the other will do something of minor significance , then sit around and show the neighbors his scrapbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little ? ' Mott had an instant response : And of the six , three will probably stand on that Moon . And that makes all the difference . Nothing , not time nor wrinkles nor scars nor divorce nor alcoholism , can erase that . They will have been there , and we will not . ' In the morning , when he had to return to General Funkhauser 's meetings , he told Millard , The door will always be open . Bring Roger . You 're a bright son-of-a-bitch , Roger . You wo n't be satisfied with beach life perma-nently . ' Try me , ' Roger said . In the spring of 1964 Norman Grant found himself in good shape and his party in chaos : no Republican in the state of Fremont wished to run against him in the senatorial primary , but he could foresee that nationally his party might be sorely weakened if it split down the middle over the candidacy of Barry Goldwater of Arizona . Grant supported Goldwater and prayed that the stubborn Rockefeller liberals might see the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Grant told his long-time assistant , Tim Finnerty , and I 'm beginning to think they mean to go through with it . ' I 'm more worried about Lyndon Johnson . That Texas cracker is a tough politician . He could win this thing going away , if we nominate Goldwater . ' We 're going to nominate him . Give the people a choice , not an echo . ' Are you happy with that cliche , Senator ? ' We 're going to win with it , if the Rockefeller people do n't do us in . ' Your problem , Senator , is your own election in Fremont . I think we 're in trouble . ' Trouble ? We do n't even have an opponent in the primary . ' But we could be vulnerable in November . This could be a big Democrat year . ' Such talk made sense to Grant , for he had learned that a politician or an admiral should approach every battle as if it were the culminating one ;  |p356besides  , as he said , If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyndon Johnson is a frightening opponent . ' So he began campaigning across Fremont in May and hit every major concentration of voters before the end of June . At the Republican conventionhe was a fortress of strength for Goldwater and a major irritation to the Rockefeller people , and when William Scranton of Pennsylvania made a belated run , spurred on perhaps by Eisenhower , he was remorseless in rejecting him . He spent much of the summer campaigning for Goldwater in other states , then hurried home to defend himself against a very strong Democratic senator from the Fremont legislature . After only a few exchanges it became apparent that his early optimism was unfounded ; his challenger knew far more about state conditions than he , and during one strategy session with Finnerty and his local aides , the Irishman slammed the cards on the table : Senator , if you go on this way , you 're going to lose . Goldwater is an albatross around your neck . Stop defending him . ' Barry Goldwater is my man , a fine decent man who could save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faces the same race you do . He 's smart enough never to mention Goldwater 's name . Listening to him , you 'd never know there was a presidential race on . Look at this literature . " No matter who else you vote for , pull the lever for Hugh Scott , a great American . " Can I print up some of them for you , in the tough districts in Webster ? ' You can not . Barry Goldwater is my candidate . I sink or swim with Goldwater . ' I was afraid you 'd say that , so I 've been restructuring the last eight weeks . Hanley is killing you on local issues , and my polls show that you 're barely holding your own . You ca n't match him where he 's strong , so you 've got to club him down where you 're strong . National leadership . Patriotism . Space . Do you think you can get John Pope to campaign for you ? ' NASA forbids it . Absolutely . ' That 's what I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's worked for you three times before . Strictly legitimate , and everyone in the state will remember that she 's John Pope 's wife . ' Will Glancey permit it ? Presidential election and all that ? ' I took the liberty of speaking with Glancey , and he and I both know that Goldwater 's going to lose by a landslide , but without saying so , he let me know that he 'd be happy having you back in the Senate . Penny 's free . ' Penny Pope was proud to work for Norman Grant 's reelection , for she had watched him at close quarters for more than a dozen years and had never found him doing a dishonest thing . He 's straight out of the Ark , an antediluvian , the poor man 's Barry Goldwater , but he has a backbone of steel . I love the man and want to see him get six more years . '  |p357Finnerty  asked her to appear with the senator in public as often as possible so that he might introduce her as ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while her brave husband , a brave son of Our Fair State , heads for the Moon . ' No mention was ever made of the fact that the only thing John Pope had flown so far was the Cape Canaveral simulator and a borrowed T-38 . But when Grant did finagle orders allowing Pope to land his T-38 , with Randy Claggett in the back seat , at the new NASA air base near Clay , Finnerty had photographers present , and after the two astronauts were shown strapped into their seats , Penny was brought forward to hand them flowers . She was also given the delicate task of explaining to the press why the senator 's wife and daughter were not campaigning for him this year : ' Elinor Grant has had severe nervous headaches which quite incapacitate her , and Marcia , as you know , is busy with her work as dean of faculty at the university out West . ' When one enterprising newsman flew to California to inspect the university and the nonexistent faculty , his expose ran in several Eastern newspapers but appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in none at all in Fremont . ' We got home free on that one , ' Penny told Finnerty . ' Thanks for having muzzled the jackals . ' ' I did n't threaten the press , just reasoned with them . ' To keep the lid on the Elinor Grant story , however , was much more difficult ; Penny had to give sworn assurances that the problem was not acute alcoholism , as certain Washington papers had intimated when trying to explain her absences from the capital , but beyond that , Penny was not willing to perjure herself . Mrs. Grant was drinking , but she was far from being a dipsomaniac ; her problem was that the little men from outer space threatened more seriously than ever before to take over control of the country , and when Penny went to reason with her she found the woman as ' spaced out ' as if she had been taking drugs . Her first question to Elinor Grant was : ' When did you first correspond with Dr. Strabismus ? ' ' Maybe ten years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years . That means you 've received one hundred and twenty monthly special deliveries , all saying about the same thing . Do n't you get suspicious ? ' ' The danger is very great , Mrs. Pope . ' ' And in those ten years you 've received not less than forty telegrams telling you that at the last minute the little men have refrained . Does n't that get monotonous ? ' ' When they do land , Mrs. Pope , adventuresses like you are going to gettheir just deserts . ' When Penny ignored this , she continued : ' Why do youcome out here to flaunt your affair with my husband before the entire state ? ' ' Please , Mrs. Grant , let 's just talk about your husband . He 's in the midstp358of a very difficult campaign . He could lose , you know . And this nation needs him . ' It does . It does . Norman 's a real patriot and the country needs him . ' So I come begging you to help this good man . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this democracy .. He was indeed , Mrs. Pope . Father was a saint , as big a hero in his wayas Norman is in his . ' I 've often heard your husband say that . ' I would not want to damage Norman 's political career . I 'm sure Father would n't want me to . ' Then you must meet with the press . They 're demanding it . They 're beginning to hint at ugly reasons . ' I could n't meet the press . ' But with unrelenting pressure , applied over more than a week , Penny Pope convinced the frightened woman that she must do so . It can be brief , but it ca n't be silly-silly , Mrs. Grant . You must answer their questions , but I would suggest this . You must not create panic in this nation . Dr. Strabismus takes you into his confidence about the arrival of the little men . But I do n't think he would want you to circulate that news generally . ' You 're quite right . He always says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . ' He would be most unhappy , I 'm sure , if you beat the gun before he gave you permission . ' I 'd never do that , ' she promised , so one afternoon in early October she and Penny conducted one of the most carefully orchestrated press conferencesof the entire national campaign . Elinor spoke of her husband 's heroism , his commitment to honest government , and his considerable contributions to the space program which would soon place an American flag on the Moon . Only once did she come close to breaking the fragile spell , when she alluded to the grave dangers hanging over America , but when the press bored in to ascertain which dangers , Penny interposed the word Communism  --  andMrs . Grant gave a little speech on that subject . At a signal from Penny , Senator Grant happened into the room , kissed his wife for Tim Finnerty 's cameras , then left for a rally in Webster . Later that day , when Finnerty sought Penny 's advice as to whether they should bring back the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was inclined to advise against it . You can use a war only so long . This Vietnam thing is beginning to worry people , especially students . ' Our party used the Civil War from the 1868 election through the 1908 . That 's forty years , and it gained them victory after victory . Norman Grant was an authentic hero and the theme is n't exhausted by any means . ' Reluctantly she agreed , but when she saw the three veterans in their uniforms she realized that unless the seams were let out , the effect was going to be comical . Old , I do n't mind . Lends a sense of history . But tight isp359funny , and people will laugh . ' Actually , when she got through with the three men they looked great , and when she sharpened their speeches to give them a more topical relevance , the effect was almost as strong as it had been during that pivotal campaign of 1946 , and she told the men , during the last days when it looked as if Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've helped a really great man sustain a career that has strengthened this nation . ' She saw that Finnerty of Massachusetts and Penzoss of Alabama were touched by what she said , but that the black high-school principal , Gawain Butler of Detroit , was unmoved , and she was not surprised when the latter said , on the eve of the election , If Senator Grant wins , I would like to see him as soon as possible . ' Why not stay over ? There 's no man in America he 's more beholden to than you , Dr. Butler . ' Two days after the election , when the Republicans of Fremont were trying to decode what had happened to their man Goldwater while celebratingquietly the reelection of their senator , Penny Pope ushered Gawain Butler in to see the victor , and after the big man had adjusted his artificial leg and seated himself comfortably , he said , I 'm sure you must think this is about a job of some kind , but it is n't . I 'm doing very well , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might become a superintendent of schools , either in Michigan or California . ' Congratulations , ' Grant said with real enthusiasm . Yes , if you 've used me to get elected to the Senate , I 've used you to further my career in Detroit . To hear my wife talk , and she does , you 'd think you made no move without consulting me . ' Your wife 's right . How many times have I called you ? ' It 's not about jobs , and yet it is , ' Butler said . It 's about space . ' Space ? You mean the Moon and that ? ' I do , ' Butler said quietly . I 'd like to show you some pictures , ' and from his briefcase , the imitation-leather kind favored by school administrators , he produced four glossy photographs sent him by NASA public relations . The first showed seven handsome masculine faces : Glenn , Slayton , Schirra and the other four from the first selection ; Armstrong , Borman , Conrad and the six others from Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Group III ; Claggett , Pope , Jensen and the three others from the Special Group . They 're our boys , ' Grant said . Thirty-six fine Americans , ' Butler said . How much would you estimate it costs you to educate each of your boys , as you call them . ' We have no figures , but someone gave an off-the-cuff guess of about three million dollars . . . each one . ' As he had practiced in his office in Detroit , Butler pointed casually at the determined face of John Pope : This boy 's from your hometown , is n't he , Senator ? '  |p360I  had nothing to do with his appointment . ' But he is from your town , and the government is paying three million dollars to educate him . ' For a very special task . ' A noble task , I do agree . But do n't these photographs seem strange to you ? ' When Grant shrugged his shoulders , Gawain Butler said sternly , Not one black face among them . ' The senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , so Butler continued : We blacks compriseabout twelve percent of the national population . There ought to be about four of our young men in those photographs . ' We have a very careful process of selection . I 'm sure that if .. Butler was not listening . From his briefcase he produced another glossy showing the tense scene in Mission Control when a critical decision had to be made concerning a Gemini flight ; it was the kind NASA took pride in circulating , for it indicated the intense concentration of some hundred men in short sleeves , grappling with the life-and-death crisis of a spacecraft two hundred miles aloft , where the blackness was intense and gravity practically null . Most of the men had crewcuts , which they believed made them look young and serious , and no one was smoking , although some were biting on pencils . They looked like the associate professors of some excellent engineeringuniversity who had just attained tenure , and they were all white . By proportion , Senator , we should have twelve or thirteen black faces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure  --  ' This nation has made space its major effort . Five billion dollars a year , maybe six , I 'm told . Publicity , speeches , whole magazines given over to this program , and not a single black man participates . Why do you always cut us off from the best parts of our national life ? ' The question came so from the heart , not only of this Detroit educator but also of the entire black community of America , that Senator Grant had to recognize its legitimacy . Why were there no blacks in this great enterprise which he had labored so strenuously to launch and keep on course ? The ugly thought came to him that Lyndon Johnson and Michael Glancey were technically Southerners , so that perhaps their regional inheritance had manifested itself , but this was unworthy , because no senator or President had ever done more honest work on behalf of the blacks than Johnson , and no so-called Southern senator had employed black secretaries in his office sooner than Mike Glancey . He wondered if the committee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he visualized its chairman , Deke Slayton , as tough and fair a man as he had ever met , and said to himself : Deke would never permit such nonsense . If a qualified black came along , he 'd grab him . Checking a folder in his desk drawer , he thought with satisfaction : Besides , he 's from Wisconsin and we Westerners have no prejudices . He rang for a servant and asked if Mrs. Pope was in the house . Shep361was n't , but the maid said she thought she might still be at headquarters , and in a few minutes Finnerty delivered her to the Grant residence . You stay , ' the senator told Finnerty , and when the newcomers were seated , Grant nodded at Gawain Butler . Tell them your complaint . ' It 's not a personal complaint , ' Butler protested . It goes far beyond that , ' and once more he spread his photographs , after which Grant asked his assistants , How do you account for it ? ' and Mrs. Pope had to confess : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , ' Butler said . Nobody ever noticed that one of our nation 's greatest enterprises was lily-white . Nobody gave a damn . ' He took from his briefcase three other photographs , not glossies this time , for they came from varied sources and not from a government public relations office . The three white people recognized the faces immediately : Jackie Robinson from baseball , Jim Brown the great football running back , and Oscar Robertson , perhaps the best basketball player who ever lived . If black men can excel in any job you give them , why would n't they prove capable in space ? ' The problem was so real , and pointed so directly at the men running the program , that Senator Grant said frankly , Gawain , you hit me with something terribly important . I was n't aware of this , and I propose to do something about it . Gather three of your best people and I 'll have Mrs. Pope issue travel orders . Be in my office in Washington on Monday . ' Turning to the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ' But if Grant had even the slightest suspicion that Dr. Mott was going to fudge the interview with bland excuses and easy promises , he did not know that tough-minded expert , for when the four black leaders were settled , and after they had made their protest in excellent fashion , he took over . I 've served on three selection committees now , and we 've striven desperately to pick Catholic or Jewish pilots , women pilots and , especially , black pilots . We 've wanted to show men of good will exactly like yourselves that we were not bound by religion , sex or color . But when the final moment came to make the harsh choices , from about a hundred down to six , we knew that each of the persons we selected had to have these qualifications , ' and he handed the committee mimeographed sheets listing these requirements : B.S. degree in science or engineeringM.S. degree in science or engineering ( advisable ) Military flight trainingTest-pilot schoolAdvanced university trainingSolid mastery of mathematics , physics , combustion engines , calculus Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of aircraftp362It 's very simple , gentlemen . You find me the young black men who have subjected themselves to training as rigorous as this , and I 'll lead the battle for their selection . ' For astronauts , maybe yes , ' Dr. Butler agreed , twisting the condemnatorypaper in his fingers , but how about the Mission Control people ? Are we to be excluded from everything ? ' Mott produced another mimeographed sheet , a long one this time , showing the educational qualifications of the men in Mission Control and a summary of the fantastic spread of special skills they had . On a large blow-up of a NASA photograph of the control crew at work , he pointed to one man after another , reciting his name and the great breadth of his education : Tom Fallester . B.S. Cornell . M.S. Cal Tech . Ph.D . MIT . Qualifiedin all branches of engineering relating to combustion engines . Six years ' work at Lewis Center in Cleveland on rockets . Our expert during flights on fuel management and engine repair . ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the grim smiles , explaining the arduous paths these notable men had followed in acquiring the manifold skills they commanded . In the entire group there was no one of whom it could be said : Tarnoff , here , had a good high-school education and one year at a teachers ' college in which his work emphasized nothing special , but he is a likable fellow . ' Tarnoff either mastered four or five fields of specific knowledge or he was in no way eligible for the team . Stanley Mott was as distressed as the four black men to whom he was talking . I can not even guess what the solution is , gentlemen . ' Do the rest of the astronauts , those coming along . . . do they have to be so highly trained in test-piloting and the like ? ' The questioner was a black professor from Harvard . Each man in the capsule has to be qualified to take over , ' Mott said without a glimmer of conciliation . But down the line ? ' the Harvard man insisted . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Mott waved the list of qualifications for the Mission Control people . But they will have to be at least as well qualified as these men . There will be no place for a black man who played four years of basketball and took basket-weaving to remain eligible . ' At his suggestion the four-man committee , accompanied by himself and Penny Pope , visited with the faculties of five excellent universities , three with engineering schools , two without , and at the conclusion of this most revealing tour , Penny compiled this doleful summary for her Senate com-mittee : We could not find in these five student bodies even one black man who was pursuing a course of hard , scientific training which would later on qualify him for astronaut selection . It was never a limitation of intelligence or ability that caused this state of affairs , for oftenp363the black males had higher raw test scores than their white classmates . In this generation the gifted black student looks to business as his ladder leading out of the ghetto and to a top salary . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board room , and at the conclusion of our tour , not one black member of our group could identify one black young man who was going to be eligible for selection ten years from now , nor even one who was preparing himself for an assignment to the Mission Control team . They do not take hard subjects . Penny Pope 's accurate summary may have satisfied the committee of black protesters , but it certainly did not satisfy Senator Grant , for when he received a copy he rang bells furiously , and that afternoon he and Senator Glancey met with Dr. Mott and his associates . Grant spoke first , using white-hot profanity , which he usually avoided : Goddammit , I want a black astronaut . I do n't care if we have to lower standards to the third-grade level . I want to see a black astronauton our roster , and I do n't want to be told it ca n't be done . ' Mott interrupted : At this point it can not be done . Do you want to endanger an entire program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here in Congress if you do n't find us a black astronaut . Do you think we can go on disinheritingover twenty million of our people ? Barring them from a programon which we spend billions of their tax dollars ? Let me tell you , if the public ever turns against your program , Mott , you are a dead duck . Now , when the next photograph is taken of Mission Control , I want to see at least four black faces in there . ' Stubbornly , Mott asked , Doing what ? ' I do n't give a goddamn what they 're doing . They can be knitting , for all I care , but I want them to be there . Do n't you agree , Senator Glancey ? ' It was agreed that before another year ended , there would be black faces in the control room , but finding them proved almost impossible , for reasons cited by the faculty and students of the five universities , but when Mott and his team really searched , they found at Wayne State University in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting people , so although he lacked calculus and flying experience , he was given the job of liaison with the press , in which he performed superbly . Further searchp364revealed a young man in Alabama , another in California and one in Massachusettswith first-class scientific backgrounds , so that when the next photographswere released , that sea of radiant white faces was speckled more realistically . Senator Grant took one of the pictures , circled the three faces in red ink , and mailed it to his good friend Dr. Butler of the Detroit Public School System : Dear Gawain , you challenged us to find them and we did . Norman . ' The mishap in Scott Carpenter 's Mercury flight , which carried him two hundred and forty miles beyond Commander John Pope 's waiting Tulagi , reminded NASA that even the smallest error in calculation or execution might drop its returning astronauts in some Central or South American jungle , so it was obligatory that all astronauts practice surviving in that terrain . Some trained in Costa Rica , some in El Salvador , but the Solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at how near it was . They left Cape Canaveral at o800 , landed at Miami Airport at 0845 and took a Pan American non-stop to Manaus , Brazil , where they landed in late afternoon at a fine , clean city eight hundred miles up the Amazon . Officers of the Brazilian navy had launches waiting , and by I700 that same day Pope and his colleagues were boating on the world 's greatest river . The Americans could not believe what they were seeing , for in their flights back and forth across the United States they had grown accustomed to the Ohio , the Mississippi and the Missouri , no mean rivers , and the marvelous Colorado , a source of continuing enchantment , so they carried in their minds some concept of what a major river should be , but they were unprepared for a real river like the Amazon . Look at the damned thing ! ' Claggett cried , and as the launch pulled away from shore the men could barely see the other side . The Amazon was not big , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazilian officer said , on this bank you will notice the line of discoloration , twenty feet up , running along the entire stretch of river . ' He interrupted to tell the astronauts he had received his education at West Point . Now what do you suppose that line represents ? ' After some irrelevant guesses were made , he said , That 's how high the Amazon rises every year in its early summer flood . ' The line was incomprehensible , twenty feet higher than where the launch rode the muddy waters . You have cliffs here , ' Claggett pointed out . On the other side , the flood must stretch forever . ' It does , ' the officer said , and the Americans looked across that fantastic expanse , trying vainly to imagine what such a flood must be like . Technically , ' the Brazilian said , we 're not really on the Amazon . This is the Negro , a jet-black network coming down out of Colombia and Venezuela . A few miles east of here , the Solomon , bright yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . '  |p365He  sped the launch downriver , pointing out to the men the dark color of the stream , and after a while they became aware that off to the right a really tremendous river was about to join , its waters angry from their turbulent trip down from the distant mountains of Peru and Ecuador . By itself it would have formed the largest river in the world ; when it joined with the Negro it would be incomparable . Then the Amazon proper would begin . ' Watch ! ' the Brazilian said , and it was apparent that no matter how many times he had taken visitors to see the impending miracle , he was still as thrilled by it as he had been the first time , for from the south came the mighty yellow Solomon , while from the north came the huge , surly black Negro . They met , but they did not blend . Side by side for nearly twenty miles the two majestic rivers shared the same channel , each as separated from the other as if a wall had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the ocean side by side , and even when the launches cut through them , again and again , the two rivers maintained their individuality , each carrying an immense load of detritus which gave it color , each pursuing its own course . And then , as night began to fall , the Americans saw two sights they would never forget . Up the newly formed Amazon came a twenty-thousand-tonship from Bremerhaven , Germany , its dark flag flying in the jungle breeze , its nose pointed toward Manaus . It was eight hundred miles from the ocean , yet it was steaming full speed ahead , secure in its knowledge that this vast river was as safe as the open sea . ' We 're in middle Kansas , ' Claggett cried , and here comes an ocean liner . ' Then the dolphin began to leap , blue , silvery beasts frolicking as if they were in the deepest Pacific , leading the ship homeward to its evening haven . Right off the bow of the launches the dolphin rose , twisting in air to spy upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amazon . Six of the dolphin accompanied the launches back to Manaus , and as they leaped in the dying sunlight Pope told the men in his boat , Hey ! They 're an omen ! Altair 's always been my lucky star ! ' ' I do n't get it , ' Cater said . The constellation Dolphin . It protects Altair . You watch ! We 'll handle the Amazon . ' The men spent the next day sightseeing in Manaus , to which the governorof the state came to pay his respects . Tucker Thompson 's photographers took many pictures of the ceremonies , after which the governor said , through an interpreter , Gentlemen , we have what I think may be a surprise for you , ' and he led their motorcade to the center of the city , where a jewel of an opera house had been erected by the Amazon rubber barons in the closing years of the nineteenth century . Architecturally it was a gem , a Venetian dream in crystal and silver , and it contained many mementos of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Caruso sang here , and E , douard de Reszke , and Adelina Patti . We hadp366magnificent seasons , with stars from all over Europe coming up our river in German ocean liners . I 'm told that Sarah Bernhardt played L ' Aiglon on that stage , and Helena Modjeska was here , too . We were the Athens of the jungle . ' It was agreed that the Solid Six would be taken by launch sixty miles up the Rio Solimoes , as the Solomon was spelled in Portuguese , there to be led ten miles up a minor tributary , from which local guides would take them five miles into the jungle and leave them . They carried with them nothing but knives , cloth that could be used as a mosquito net , and three radios that would broadcast their position constantly but not receive messages from the outside . If a man broke a leg , he would be rescued automatically , after three days . The guide into the jungle was mestizo  --  **31;9769;TOOLONG  --  andhe said nothing as he led the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could extricate themselves . Without saying goodbye , he turned to retrace the confusing path he had taken , but just as he left the group he looked at Pope , winked , and with his head indicated a tree heavy with palm leaves of a sort John had not seen before : Muy bueno , senor , ' he said in Spanish , and disappeared . The seven men were now ominously alone , seven because they had with them a canny French-Canadian woodsman , master of many tricks , and it would be his job to instruct them in the wily arts of survival . His name was Georges , which the astronauts quickly transformed into Gorgeous Georges . He told them , Anything that moves , grab it . Anything that looks good to eat , let me smell it . ' It was no longer a game ; now seven hungry men without weapons had to forage and improvise for three days , and hope to come out alive . By the close of that first day it was clear that the hero of this expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Carolina , for this hard-grained little fellow had a score of ingenious ideas remembered from his boyhood days in the cypress swamps along the Little Pee Dee in his home state . He could divert a small stream and thus isolate a fish ; he could set traps for any animals that might wander by ; he devised a snare for birds and another for monkeys ; and he said that if anyone spotted a python moving in , to call him . He was witty , and persistent and lucky , and although he caught nothing that first day , so that the men went to bed hungry , on the second day one of his traps did snare an iguana , but since the others had not found a way to make fire , the astronauts had to eat it raw , which they did eagerly if not with pleasure . Pope , remembering the signal thrown by the mestizo guide , asked the men what good the palm tree might serve , and Timothy Bell , who had lived on an Allied Aviation expense account and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive item is hearts of palm salad , ' so Pope andp367Jensen attacked the tree without knowing where its heart was or what it was supposed to look like . The palm tree defended its secret stoutly , and the two men were in a drenching sweat by the time their small knives had hacked it apart , but when Jensen passed down the succulent baby leaves the astronauts tore into them , and one of the men said , With a Caesar dressing these could be delicious . ' They 're not too bad with raw iguana , either , ' Pope said . The late afternoons and nights were made unbearable by insects , whose stings were intensified by the constant rain of sweat that poured from every crevice . Hickory Lee , an outdoorsman , kept tasting the sweat on the heel of his left thumb , and said ominously , We 're losing our salt at a dangerous rate , ' and when the others made this most useful test they confirmed Lee 's suspicion that their perspiration was turning acid . Ed Cater , the Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a story he had read about fliers in World War II being lost in the jungles of Guadalcanal : Two bad scenes , Jap snipers and any cut on the legs . You cut your shin in this climate , ninety-nine percent humidity , it never heals . Just rots away . ' How soon ? ' Claggett asked . Maybe six months . ' Good . We 'll live till Christmas . ' Claggett 's humor never riled his companions . He was a loud Texan , but he was also the best pilot in the group and the one most likely to survive any ordeal . Now he said soberly , Let 's suppose our radios go on the blink . All three . We 're in this jungle and we do n't know a damned thing more than we do right now . How in hell do we get out ? ' The astronauts looked instinctively to Gorgeous Georges , who demurred : That 's your job . ' The important thing , ' Jensen said , is to sit quietly for about an hour and figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in an analysis of its situation . They said they knew they were in Brazil , but he would not allow that . If we crashed in a Gemini capsule , we would n't know where in hell we were . ' We 'd know we were in South America . ' Granted . ' Jensen made it a kind of game , twenty questions , with him the moderator . They did not know they were near the Amazon River , but the humidity and the thickness of the jungle made it likely they were close to some body of water . They knew that so far , at least , what water was available was potable , and they knew they could subsist on hearts of palm for some days ; at least it stifled the belly pains . Gradually they concluded that the imperative thing would be not top368guess where the larger body of water was , nor in which direction safety lay , but the construction of a signal which could be seen from search planes . They could not clear the jungle to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cloth to the tops of trees . And how do we get up there ? ' Bell asked , and Jensen replied , Simple , you haul your ass up or you die . ' Can we be sure that search planes will be looking for us ? ' Bell asked . As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow , ' Jensen said . That 's one thing we must never doubt . Their radar will tell them about where the capsule went down . America will never let us rot here . They 'd launch a thousand planes if necessary . That we must never doubt . ' Cater said he 'd read a story about a naval pilot downed in the waters off Guadalcanal in World War II , right under the nose of Japanese shore guns , and how planes of the Army Air Corps , as it was called then , fought an entire day to save that one flier . And they did , ' he said . But was it a true story ? ' Bell asked . I think it must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were over , and the radios vectored the rescue teams to where the hungry astronauts were waiting , their faces scarred from mosquito bites , Cater said , Jensen , I do n't know whether you can fly an airplane or not , but if I 'm in one that has to crash in a jungle , I want you as my copilot . ' It was a tense moment , for the four other astronauts shared Cater 's assessment of the young fellow , but Jensen reverted to a gag Army men had used when starting their flight training . Spreading his legs as if working the rudders in a trainer , he grabbed an imaginary stick with both hands and cried in horror , looking hard to his right , Sir , sir ! How do you pull this thing to make it go up ? ' When the bone-tired astronauts reached their quarters in Manaus , Cater cried , My God ! It ca n't be ! ' But it was . Sitting on a bar stool in the lounge was petite Cynthia Rhee , her impudent eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of Florida and across the Caribbean to the confluence of the Negro and the Solimoes , where the Amazon began . I had to see how you looked when you came out of the jungle , ' she said in her lovely accent . You look awful . ' She touched Cater on the cheek . The bites , do they hurt ? ' She stared straight into his eyes as she said this . After you get a certain number .. Who assumed control at the bad moments ? ' she asked . Guess , ' Cater said , falling onto a stool . I think maybe Jensen from South Carolina . ' Now why would you say that ? ' Cater asked . Because he would know swampy land . South Carolina has many swamps . '  |p369You  still have all your marbles , ' Cater said , and Cynthia turned her attention to Claggett . You promised at Cocoa Beach to tell me about your early days , ' she said . Work comes first , ' Claggett said , reaching for a beer . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she said to all the men , is talk to me . Because what you 're doing is very important , and you do n't want it immortalized in the bullshit this man peddles . ' And she pointed to Tucker Thompson hurrying in to protect his charges from this dangerous slant-eye , as he called her . Despite Tucker 's efforts , she succeeded in leading Claggett to his room , where they engaged in love-making so wild and varied that Randy finally asked , Does the Japanese government give you kids graduate courses ? ' I 'm Korean , ' she said as they lay exhausted after an especially vigorous engagement . You do n't even know where Korea is , do you ? ' Claggett smiled . It 's part of China , somewheres . Japan invades it every twenty years . ' Why are you Americans  --  even you bright ones  --  why are you so ignorant of the rest of the world ? ' The rest of the world is that flea-bitten jungle out there . ' This made her quite angry . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free ? ' She jerked the bedclothes up to her chin and glared at her stupid American . Very quietly Randy droned like a briefing officer : You take off at Fukuoka on the island of Kyushu . It 's a short hop across the Korean Strait to Pusan . Then Taegu , Seoul , west to Inchon , then Kaesong and a hard flight northwest to Pyongyang , where the heavy antiaircraft waits . Then up to the Yalu River and down the east coast to Hungnam , where all hell breaks loose . Then down to K-22 on the Sea of Japan . . . where I fought the Russians and the Chinese for one hellishly cold winter and dreamed of a beautiful Korean Jo-san I had fallen in love with at Pusan . ' Cynthia Rhee said nothing . With the sheet tucked under her chin , she gazed at Claggett for some moments , then leaned over and kissed him . I apologize . I should know by now not to ask questions before I finish my research . ' Can you reach me a beer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bedstead and the wall , marring each . I learned that during the weekends at Yale . But if you were in Korea , then you know how the Japanese despise us . I could take a machine gun to every damned Japanese in the world . ' But you went to college there . ' ' I was born there . And my parents were treated like cattle . I have this burning hunger to show the Japanese .. ' Do n't tight your battles in my bed . Lie down . ' They made love through the night , talking intermittently about Korea ,  |p370NASA  , the jungle . Never before had Claggett met such a woman , one so delicately lovely yet so sternly driven . Usually she was far ahead of him in her shrewd analysis of the astronaut program , and her witty observations on the other men of the Solid Six were startling in their perceptions . If I were Deke Slayton . . . ' she began . You know Deke Slayton ? ' It 's my job to know everybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd want you as commander , and guess who as pilot ? In the righthandseat ? ' Claggett guessed Jensen , but she said , Wrong . On land he 's fantastic . He 'd be sensational managing a department store like Macy 's . But upstairs I 'd want John Pope . Not a pleasant man , but very capable . ' You do n't cotton to the straight arrows , do you ? ' She knew the term . In fact , she knew all the terms and their accurate definitions ; she had made herself into an astronaut and intuitively she knew how they functioned . Pope would get the capsule down when you blanked out  --  and that 's what counts . Getting the damned capsule down . Pacific ... Atlantic . Desert . . . jungle . Let 's get the damned thing down . ' As they left the room to join the others for the short flight back to Cape Canaveral  --  primitive Amazonian jungle to the Moon craft in one short day  --  Claggett asked , Is it true what Slobber Lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of us ? As an act of research ? ' Randy , do I ask you " Is it true that on your first Gemini flight you became so excited that things came apart and you wet your drawers ? " Should n't people with a fondness for each other take certain things on faith ? ' Well , did you say it ? ' No . Did you wet your pants ? ' Yes . ' And they kissed for a long time . No one in America , not even the NASA high command , followed more assiduously the country 's adventures in space than Dr. Leopold Strabismus , president of Universal Space Associates and chancellor of the University of Space and Aviation , for he knew in his bones that massive changes were under way in American life and that space was only a fragment of the whole . He suspected that the present surge of interest would finally transform itself into something quite unexpected , and it was necessary for him to be ready for whatever did happen . His original USA flourished , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiving in return his constantly improved explanations of what the little men were up to . Ramirez , with an enlarged budget , was able to contract with a Los Angeles printer for a monthly letter done on good stock , with an occasional color diagram explaining how the spaceships from distant planets maneuveredp371among the Sun 's planets : one popular edition showed a cutaway of a spaceshipitself . Strabismus drew the diagrams but used the newfangled applique alphabets printed on transparent cellophane for the lettering . ' Renewed subscriptions have increased forty-one percent since our use of color , ' Ramirez reported to Dr. Strabismus , but the latter was no longer acutely interested in his first venture ; the university was succeeding beyond his hopes . It still had no students or faculty , but its issuance of diplomas had multiplied tenfold . ' There 's an insatiable desire for education , ' he told Marcia as they lay in bed one night . ' And have you noticed that if a person is willing to pay three hundred fifty dollars for a master 's degree , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctorate . ' He and Marcia often speculated on what the purchasers did with their degrees , and just as his instincts had warned him to prepare the pamphlet which Senator Grant 's wife had used to refute Dr. Mott when he tried to attack USA , so he now had his staff compile a reassuring publication about the university , which was sent in response to inquiries from any institution whose administrators were becoming suspicious that one of its faculty who offered as his proof of education a degree from USA in Los Angeles was committing fraud . The pamphlet was a masterpiece , showing a complete faculty with distinguished degrees from all over the world , including Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , and a list of recent publications written by these scholars . Dr. Strabismus himself wrote the bibliography , and it included papers on splitting genes , synthesizing a new drug that would replace insulin in the treatment of diabetes , and a cost-time analysis of assembly work at a GeneralMotors plant . His knowledge was so encyclopedic , and his interests so broad , that he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any books , and as he dictated each one he thought : I wish I had time to write that paper . Now . It 's needed : Theory of Tumbling Bodies Entering Planetary Atmospheres with Application to Probe Vehicles and Australian Tektites . Once , when a full professor from the University of Wisconsin came out to investigate the credentials of an applicant who had landed a job using fraudulent degrees , Strabismus told him frankly , ' Your man 's a fake . Fire him . His check bounced . ' ' How do you get away with this , Strabismus ? ' ' In California , so many churches and colleges want to crank up that the state has little energy left over to supervise us , once we get started . We 're free to do about what we want , so long as we do n't steal state funds . We pay our registration fee , our yearly renewals . We keep our nose clean and we delude nobody . ' ' How about this faculty list ? ' ' Does it hurt anybody ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel like a criminal ? ' ' I certainly do not . I 've been bucking the system all my life , and I thinkp372I 've performed a useful service . ' He was so frank that the Wisconsin man actually liked him , and they talked for a long time . Tell me , at Wisconsin do you detect the beginnings of a falling away from science ? ' We certainly do . The flood of money pumped by the federal governmentinto the science faculties has caused a lot of resentment among the rest of us . ' What 's your field ? ' Humanities . And we 're hurting . I 'm philosophy , principally . ' Strabismus wanted to know his specialty , and when the visitor said the Nature of Truth , the president of USA surprised him with a flow of names associated with that subject and an accurate summary of the positions of many : Hobbes , Kant , Bradley , Brand Blanshard of Yale . You think the antiscience movement will continue to grow ? ' Strabismus asked . I do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , are your young people big with tarot cards ? I-Ching ? ' The professor snapped his fingers and said , Strange you should ask that . There 's a real movement toward the occult . ' Astrology ? ' Very big . ' The man from Wisconsin stroked his chin , then stared at the floor . It 's quite confusing , really . In space we 're having our greatest scientifictriumphs . On the ground our young people are turning sharply away from science . ' How much of it is mere youthful rebellion ? ' Strabismus asked . At this moment he heard his dean of faculty at the door . As she walked into the hall he called out and invited her to join them . This is Dr. Grant , my dean . ' He brought her up to date on the science-antiscience rebellion and restated his question . Clearly , ' she said , many young people rebel against science , any kind of order , just to gig their parents . ' Excuse me , ' the professor said . Gig their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profes-sors . ' You mean that if the university goes over heart and soul to science ... ' Then to hell with science , ' Marcia said . Success in charlatanism had produced subtle and pleasing changes in the administrators of USA : Dr. Strabismus was somewhat heavier from continued good eating ; his beard was more neatly trimmed and his face more rounded and benevolent ; in fact , he looked like a contented university president whose football team had just been invited to play in the Rose Bowl . Marcia 's handsome face had lost its perpetual pout , for she was no longer angry at anyone , and her body had lost a good deal of its baby fat , so that while the president grew stouter , she grew slimmer , and she wasp373so attractive , with her warm smile and her hair in neat braids , that when she suggested to the professor that he join them for dinner , he accepted eagerly . ' Tell me , ' he asked over the wine , how did you two ever get involved in these rackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' she asked . ' Senator Grant 's daughter . I just grew tired of hearing his patriotic bullshit . ' The professor winced . ' So you 're part of the rebellion ? ' ' I sure am . ' When he asked if she had finished college , she said , ' Freshmanyear , almost . C-minus . You see , I got tired of your bullshit , too . You professors , I mean . ' ' What do you foresee as the next big mania ? ' Strabismus asked . ' Something antiscientific , that 's for sure . ' ' I did most of the talking before . Now you tell us why you think that . ' The professor of philosophy said that when a democracy responds totally to an imagined outside threat , the way America did to Russia 's Sputnik , the intellectuals quickly see that this is spurious and rebel against it , but in this particular case the situation was further confused by anxiety among college students over the military draft and among the lower middle classes by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things close at hand required attention . ' The blacks , you know , are quite opposed to the space program . They 're cut out of it . ' ' The blacks are cut out of everything , ' Strabismus said . ' Do you know that in my Universal Space Associates , one of the hottest movements ever , I have not a single black enrolled , so far as I know . But in the diploma thing , quite a few put down their dollars for that degree . They believe the framed diploma will make the difference . ' As they spoke , Marcia turned on the television , and a news program refuted what they had been saying , for at a gala press conference officials of NASA were presenting the next two heroes who would fly in the Gemini program , and the junior member , who would sit in the right-hand seat , was Randy Claggett from Texas . He was most appealing as he smiled , gaptoothed , into the camera and allowed as how his success so far had been pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee , and their three fine children . ' One more step on our way to the Moon , ' the spokesman said as the camera zoomed in on Randy and Debby Dee . ' There 's a lot of fascination left in space , ' Strabismus said . ' And it 'll increase when they actually attack the Moon . But believe me , Professor , the drop-off is going to be sensational .. ' And you want to be in first when the next racket starts ? ' ' I do . The diploma thing adds nice extra money , but I doubt that it could finance our big building . You need something big , some big , swinging movement . All I know is , it 's going to be antiscience , antispace . But what form it 's going to take ... I wish you could tell me. '  |p374The  five Earthbound members of the Solid Six were proud that Claggett had been chosen so early for a ride in space , and they haunted the control rooms at Cape Canaveral to follow his progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President slain less than two years earlier , but none of the professionals ever used that name ; to them it would always be Canaveral . They were living , as usual on their eastern trips , at the Bali Hai in Cocoa Beach , and when it appeared assured that Claggett and his teammate were going to make a success of their flight , Ed Cater suggested that they all drive back to the Dagger Bar for a celebration at which he and Gloria would provide the beer , and Hickory Lee the oysters . All the astronauts , especially those from landbound states , relished Florida seafood , particularly the oysters , because they could be consumed in great quantities without producingfat . As Claggett and his partner were now learning , even one extra ounce of fat in that Gemini capsule meant added problems , so that the young pilots had a phobia about pies and cakes : They can wait till we 're retired . ' There were three routes by which a car could travel the twenty miles from the space center to the motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringing islands , or it could come down the middle on Route 3 and make better time , or it could move sharply west onto the mainland and come speeding down U.S. i , a well-kept double highway . The last way was longer but much quicker . General Motors had presented each astronaut with a Corvette , and the men loved these sleek , swift cars . Lee , Cater and Bell drove theirs down ALA to enjoy the relaxing scenery along the shore . Pope and young Harry Jensen , having been held up by consultations with Dr. Mott , left late , and they elected to drive over to U.S. r and then to speed south to the town of Cocoa , then east on Route 520 to the island at Cocoa Beach . It was a gala afternoon ; everything was going right and their team was at last in the air , which meant that quite soon the rest of them would be entering space , too . Jensen , who was better with a car than Pope , led the way in his specially painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury convertible , which he still preferred , admired the manner in which the South Carolinian handled his car , never making a foolish move , always prepared to ease sideways , left or right , to enter a spot left open by the slower traffic . It was like flying , really , riding tail gunner to Harry Jensen . Pope , peering ahead , spotted the heavy old Buick coming from the opposite direction when it was a good distance away , and casually muttered to himself , That one does n't know how to drive . ' As the big black car neared , he thought : He 's weaving . Is his front wheel funny ? Instinctively , Pope took maneuvers which would provide him maximum escape room if the Buick really was in trouble , and noticed with some dismay that Jensen was not doing so.  |p375Then  he uttered a wild cry as the Buick leaped across the median strip and plowed directly into Jensen 's Corvette , knocking it clear across the roadway in such a manner that Pope had great difficulty maneuvering his Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation saved him . When he elbowed his way through the crowd he found the driver of the Buick unscathed and very drunk . Harry Jensen was so completely mashed he was barely recognizable through the blood and scattered brains . Restraining himself from killing the murderer , Pope spoke to no one , returned quietly to his Mercury and sped off before the police arrived , for he had work to do . He roared down U.S. i , spun his car east on Route 520 , then swiftly south on A1A , grinding his wheels into the parking lot of the Bali Hai . He did not run through the entrance lobby , but as soon as Cynthia Rhee saw his ashen face she knew something terrible had happened , and she supposed it had to do with Claggett 's flight : John , what is it ? ' Because he had come to think of her as a member of the team , he grabbed her left arm and pulled her along as he sought for Cater and Lee in the bar . When he saw them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Jensen 's just been killed . ' How ? ' Drunk driver came across the median on U.S. i . Wiped him out . ' You sure ? ' Brains across the highway . ' Oh Jesus ! ' The two men who had intended to host the party stood silent for a moment , then Cater said , Where 's Tim Bell ? See if you can find him , Hickory . ' And when Bell joined them , shaking and pale , Cater said , ' Anybodyknow where Inger is ? ' I saw her at the pool , ' Bell said . We ca n't tell her there , ' Cater said . I 'll take her to her room , ' Cynthia suggested , but Cater grabbed her firmly : I think not . ' The men knew that Jensen and the Korean girl had been sleeping together at odd opportunities and they suspected that Inger also knew . Cater went to the pool , and in his gentle Deep South drawl , said , Inger , we 're having a blowout tonight , and Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dressing .. When she reached her room she found the three astronauts waiting  --  Pope , Bell , Hickory Lee  --  standing very straight , their distress clear in their eyes as they looked at her . Oh God ! ' she gasped . On the highway , ' Cater said . Totally wiped out . ' ' Oh God ! ' In her presence Cater went to the phone and called Deke Slayton : This is 1 ? d Cater . Astronaut Harry Jensen has just been killed in a highwayp376accident on U.S. i between the Cape and Cocoa Beach . No word of this must be sent aloft to Claggett . Call the police for verification . ' Miss Rhee had alerted the other wives , and now they streamed into the motel room , composed , tight-lipped and beautiful . Sandy Lee , the toughmindedgirl from Tennessee , took command , ordering the men from the room . Cool , determined , she pushed the other women away when they wanted Inger to lie down , said brusquely , Walk it off , kid . ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , then left the receiver off the hook . She would not allow the others to turn on the television , but she did order drinks and suggested that Inger have a Jack Daniels straight . Through that long night the five women sat together , talking , now and then laughing as they recalled some scandalous thing that had happened to them , weeping more often . And in the course of the night each woman called Texas to ask about her children . At about two-thirty Inger said , If she wants to come in , let her . ' And Debby Dee found Cynthia Rhee in a corner of the Dagger Bar , transcribing notes . The men stayed in the bar , drinking , except that Pope and Cater ducked out to accompany the police to the morgue to identify the corpse , but this they could barely do , for Jensen had no face . When Randy Claggett splashed down after his Gemini flight , the first thing he heard aboard the rescue carrier was that his good buddy Harry Jensen had been killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canaveral he stormed into the police station , demanding to know who the killer was . He learned that the man had accumulated six citations for drunken driving and had once caused a woman to lose a leg . His license had not been taken away because his lawyer pleaded that it would be unfair to deprive this fine young man of his means of earning a living . ' He had never gone to jail ; he had never been penalized ; he just kept driving that big Buick when he was dead drunk , and nobody gave a damn . Fifty thousand people killed a year , ' the police chief said . We have good reason to believe that more than half are because of drunk driving . ' Ca n't you do anything ? ' Claggett asked in seething anger . Automobile people wo n't let us . Whiskey people wo n't let us . And the courts abuse us if we arrest them . I 've arrested your man three times . Told the judge he was an accident looking for a place to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 . Married . Arrest I : Drunk driving . Arrest 4 : Drunk driving hitting a woman . Arrest 6 : Drunk driving . He pointed to that last entry : That was only three weeks ago . ' America wants it that way , ' the policeman said , folding the file and jamming it into his desk.  |p377And  then a familiar miracle of military life occurred . Older officers  --  Army , Navy , Air Force , Marine , it made no difference  --  who had lost their wives began flying in to Canaveral to talk with Inger Jensen and take her two children on picnics . Younger officers not yet married , who had served with Harry at some remote base , turned up to see how she was doing , and three men who had tested planes with him at Edwards stopped by . It was as if signals had been flashed through the military establishment : One of our women has been left a widow with two kids . ' In other walks such a woman with two rambunctious flaxen-haired children might be at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military a young woman with children became especially attractive , as if she brought with her a ready-made family . So like white corpuscles hastening toward a wound to purify it , officers unmarried or widowed leaped forward to protect Harry Jensen 's widow . To the surprise of the five astronaut families who vetted the suitors , she would have none of them . Bundling her children into a secondhand station wagon bought with Harry 's insurance , she started across country to a small college in Oregon , where she had been offered a job as librarian . When Debby Dee kissed her goodbye , the big Texan woman said , You 're a horse 's ass , Inger , but God , I love you , ' and the little Swedish girl replied , It 's as if he was in the seat beside me . He 'll always be . ' When Stanley Mott 's younger son , Christopher , was arrested for selling marijuana to grammar-school students in suburban Washington , his father spent three nights , after daylong meetings of his committee on the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy to a house of correction , and on the afternoon of the fourth day , during a heated debate on whether the surface of the Moon might be composed of deep dust into which a landing vehicle might sink never to be seen again , he leaned forward onto the table , collapsed , and slipped sideways to the floor . When Rachel Mott was informed , she was sure it was a heart attack , but after NASA doctors had examined him they assured her that it was mere exhaustion : Even geniuses have to rest some time . Keep him in bed . Do n't let him worry . ' As soon as word of his collapse circulated among the Solid Six , now Five , each of the astronauts wrote personally to Mott , attesting to their appreciation of what he had done for them , from the days of the selection committee to his supportive work at the time of Claggett 's flight , and the five wives did the same with Mrs. Mott , but the most surprising outcome was a personal visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two reasons , Dr. Mott . To express my hopes for your speedy recovery , for you are a good man and you 're needed , and to see firsthand what penalties a scientist pays for his dedication to space . '  |p378How  can you afford to spend so much time on one story ? ' I submit something almost every week . The paper gets good return on my modest expense account , believe me . ' Am I your story this week ? ' You are . " Overworked Scientist Collapses on Way to Moon . " Everyone in Japan will be able to visualize that . ' Engineer , not scientist . ' So there we have the first conflict . Since you always resented your below-the-salt status as an engineer , now that you 've become a real scientist , you refuse the title . Out of intellectual pique ? ' Wrapped in his bathrobe , Mott adjusted his eyeglasses and smiled . You may be right , but I 'm an engineer , always will be . ' He laughed outright . Know what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old NACA ? " Scientists dream about doing great things . Engineers do them . " ' It was surprising how men of all caliber , and many women , were willing to talk freely with this remarkable Korean woman . She was almost thirty now , all nonsense flushed away ' as she once said to Rachel Mott , and everything about her seemed to disqualify her for the arduous task she had undertaken : she was too small to wrestle with the crowds that surrounded the astronauts , too pretty to be taken seriously . Her English was delightful to hear , with its occasional mispronunciation of 1 , r and f , and she had never learned to control her fiery temper ; but she had a charming way of throwing herself upon the mercy of listeners , a woman without sham or pretense who wanted to delve into problems of intense mutual concern . Nothing derailed her , not abuse or scorn or outright refusal to answer her intrusive questions . As she had told Rachel one night at the Bali Hai : Gigantic things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world requires to know all aspects . ' I should like to tabulate the forces that brought you down , ' she said as she sat beside Mott 's bed . ' Jensen 's death . I think you were like all of us . We saw that heavenly boy with his fairy-tale princess of a wife as the perpetual youth , gallant . . . so goddamned gallant . ' After pausing to bite her lip and keep back the tears , she continued to bore in . So you must have seen Jensen as the son you never had .. I have two sons . ' Without altering in any way her tone of voice , she said , Of course . But one is a California homosexual , the other a Washington drug pusher . ' Mott did not attempt to fight back . On these two difficult confrontations he had made his peace , but he did ask , Is it necessary to print that ? ' To print it ? Maybe not . To know it ? Absolutely , ' and she digressed to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceramics of Korea ? Probably the greatest in the world . Our potters never try to make a perfect vase , flawless in all dimensions . They allow the clay to manifest itself , to work out its own destiny . And how do they achieve that unmatched celadon finish ? They do n't apply it as a celadon color . They underglaze , one subtle shade after another . Pale colors you are never allowed to see . Andp379they follow this patient ritual because they learned that if they go in some bright morning , all eager to create a masterpiece , and simply brush onto their vase the celadon color , it will always remain just that , as long as the vase exists . But if they start way back and apply first a slight gray , then a green , then a shadowy brown and finally the pale yellow , when the time comes to place the real yellow , it rests upon a pulsating base which will enable it through the next five hundred years to become whatever shade of exquisite celadon the passing fancy requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances and breathes and lives it own life . ' I work like a Korean potter . I underpaint , ridiculously .

' ' You have a long perspective . ' ' No , a very long perception . You seem sometimes to forget that you and your glorious young men are engaged in an adventure that will command public interest for at least five centuries . You 're not in America in 1965 . You 're in the books of world history in 2465 . And if dedicated people like me do not tell your story accurately today , do you know how the books of 2465 are going to tell it ?

I never cared much for you , Dr. Mott , till I saw for myself how much you love your sons . ' ' Why was I repulsive ? ' ' Because in my little world I saw you always in your companionship with Tucker Thompson , and that is a very shabby setting for an honest gem . ' ' I read your story in the German papers about the death of Jensen . It was n't much different from what Thompson wrote for his rag , except his pictures were better . ' ' Wait ! Wait , Dr. Mott !

The old Korean potters will be proud of me for observing their rules so rigorously . ' Then , in a preamble to the penetrating questions she was about to ask Mott , she did some revealing underpainting on herself : Did you ever stop to think , Dr. Mott , that for really great ceramics , the ones that sing , you must go to Korea . Japanese work is heavy , uninspired , often very ordinary . Because they do n't know how to sing , and we Koreans do . ' His second visitors from the Bali Hai were equally surprising .

Has his men photographing Debby Dee and Penny like mad , in hopes we 'll crash and he can play up their heroic sorrow the way he did with Inger Jensen .

She wo n't be single long , ' Claggett said . I warned Debby Dee last night . " If that Swede is still around next autumn , out you go , babe , and in she comes . " ' Now Pope broke in .

" But what eats him is the fact that of the six available wives  --  five , now that Inger 's out  --  he gets for his exclusivethe two he likes least . ' And Pope counted on his fingers : ' He 'd love to have Gloria Cater and that Mississippi charm . Or Cluny Bell and her sultry come-at-me , tiger . Or everybody 's favorite rags-to-riches hillbilly , Sandy Lee . He could do wonders with any two of them . But what does he get ? Debby Dee , who calls NASA brass " them stupid sonnombeeches , " and Penny Pope , who insists on staying in Washington with no white fence and no kids . ' Claggett was laughing . ' I heard him tell Cater last night , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we came on a different mission , Doc , ' and he began to fumble with the shopping bag , taking from it a stack of books whose covers were lurid and torn . ' You take space too seriously , Doc . That 's why you 're flat on your ass and we 're up and about . Now , the proper trainin ' for an astronaut , or for someone like you who works with astronauts , is not all that calculus shit you bother your brains with , but some good old science fiction of the kind that got me and Pope started . ' ' I never wasted my youth on that crap , ' Pope protested . Mott pointed out that of all the engineers he had known , practically none had bothered with science fiction , whereas almost all the scientists had . ' Why is that ? ' he asked his two visitors . ' I think you were always preoccupied with how to do it , ' Pope suggested . ' The scientists were always far out , setting goals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Randy ? ' Mott asked . ' Those wonderful sexy covers . I did n't give a damn about science fiction , but I always hoped that the gorillas from outer space were gon na rip the rest of the clothes off and go at it . Month after month I longed for the miracle , but it never happened , and after about six years I was bright enough to see that they were connin ' me , so I began to read the stories for the content . And they were very good . ' He had brought eight books , three anthologies with sexy covers , five full-length novels with covers featuring the anomalies of outer space , and as he passed them over to Mott , he spread the sexy items on the bed and said , ' It 's always perplexed me . We speak of women as the weaker sex . But have you noticed these covers and the ads in the magazines ? The men are always dressed to the hilt to protect them from the sun and the dust and the frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these cosmonauts ! Every inch of their body covered to ward off radiation . The women , hardly a stitch on . ' With his hands on the anthologies he said , ' When I first joined my Marine squadron I thought , " These must be the brightest officers in the world . They all read the Sunday New York Times , " and I was a dumh stiff from Texas , so I figured that if I wanted to keep up ,  |p382I  'd better read the Times too , but then I found that all they read was the glossy magazine section , to see the naked women in the ads . Fifty sciencefictionmagazines do n't give you half the naked women that a good issue of the Sunday Times does . ' How am I supposed to read these ? ' Mott asked . Any special order ? ' There sure is , and I have ' em marked . Please read ' em in order , because then you 'll get the drift . But I 'm gon na read the first one aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the anthologies he began to read in his strong Texas voice a story much loved by sci-fi fans . It was called To Serve Man , ' and dealt with porcine visitors from outer space who arrive mysteriously on Earth with two inestimable boons : a way to neutralize all weaponry , so that perpetual peace can reign , and an unlimitedfree food supply , so that want will be eradicated . They also introduce better systems of government and one gentle innovation after another for the betterment of man . The Earth is ecstatic , all except one suspicious computer expert who keeps trying to decipher a handbook one of the Earth 's defensive men has acquired surreptitiously from the spacecraft . Day after day , as the rest of the world applauds the swinelike intruders , he labors at his task of breaking their code , and after many futile leads he succeeds in at least interpreting the title of the manual , To Serve Man , and with this reassurance the Earthlings accept the benevolent visitors at face value , realizing that a millennium has arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his associates are entering the spacecraft for an exploratory trip to the distant planet from which the strangers came , the computer expert rushes out to warn them : It 's a cook-book . ' I like that ! ' Mott cried , and Claggett said , I thought you would . ' Who wrote it ? ' Mott asked , and Claggett said , A favorite of mine . Damon Knight . You 'll find other yarns by him in the anthologies . ' In the ensuing days Mott made his acquaintance with that gleaning of elegant stories crafted by men like Asimov , Bradbury and Leiber . Two of the shortest stories illustrated why their authors were deemed masters of the genre . The first was by Robert Heinlein and depicted a loud-mouthed drunk in a sleazy bar near a field from which a spacecraft is about to take off for some far planet . The man has suspicions about this particular experimentand a generally jaundiced view about exploration in general . ' ColumbusWas a Dope ' was the name of the tale . The bore rambles on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of further adventures , and nothing much seems to be happeninguntil two glowing paragraphs at the end . The bartender throws one of his glasses into the air and watches approvingly as it drifts very slowly downward . Then he tells his listeners that working in one-sixth gravity has done wonders for his bunions , which had been killing him on Earth . The bar is on the Moon.  |p383Mott  was enchanted by the skill displayed in such stories , but the one which made the most lasting impression was by an Englishman living in Ceylon , Arthur C. Clarke , of whom even the astronauts who did not like sci-fi spoke highly . It was most adroitly told : a Jesuit priest is on an interplanetaryprobe in what appears to be A.D. 2534 , and he is much perplexed by the impact of science on his religion , but at last he reaches the environs of the Phoenix Nebula , whose central star exploded about 3500 B.C. , becoming a mighty nova . Of course , several planets near the star were consumed by fire , but at the far edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far away as Pluto is from our Sun  --  one small planet had survived extinction . All life on it had been burned away , as life on Earth must some day be , but the rocky structure of the planet had survived , and when the exploring team reached the surface , they found that the people who had lived there thousands of years before , and had foreseen the extinction of their society , had compiled a record of what life had been like on their especially congenial planet . By means of tapes and maps and diagrams buried deep where fire could not touch them , they explained to those who they were sure would visit their homeland one day what a splendid , vibrant life they had enjoyed : the great cities , the accumulated knowledge , the happy lives . And the picture of their society was so enviable that the Jesuit wondered why God , in order to send His planet Earth a signal in the year 4 B.C. , had set ablaze this great nova so that its light might guide three wise men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more advanced than Earth 's had had all of its living forms of life scorched away . With real avidity Mott read Claggett 's recommendations , and almost never was he disappointed , for the chaff had been winnowed away , leaving a core of stories that would have graced any imaginative literature . He was especially impressed by the writing of a man whose name he had never heard before , Stanley G. Weinberg , who during the 19305 had produced a small collection of stories which had lifted science fiction out of the swamp of little green men and naked ladies . He wrote of the impending exploration of Mars with subtlety and almost love , populating the planet with creatures facing the real problems their inhospitable climate would create ; these were stories in the great tradition of Petronius and Boccaccio , and Mott wanted to know more about him . He had started writing , the brief notes said , only when an inescapable death loomed , and he was allowed only eighteen months in which to report his vision . When Mott read this his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made no effort to halt them ; he was thinking of Harry Jensen , that golden child who had been so carefully nurtured by his society for some great task and who had been struck down so senselessly by one of the worst manifestationsof that society . He calculated the investment society had made in Jensen from the day he entered the University of Minnesota , through thep384airplanes he cracked up in flight training , to the heavy cost of his work at Edwards and on to the millions spent on him in NASA . But the greatest loss was what he might have contributed to the NASA program  --  he would have been one of the best  --  or to the American society later , because he and Inger stood for something . He could be a rowdy child , this Jensen , and he was not above ducking out for a quick weekend with Cindy Rhee in an Oklahoma motel , but he was a man and his loss was inconsolable . Dead Jensen , wandering Millard in California , brittle Chris in trouble with the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his heart , and through his tears he prayed for others : God , watch over Claggett and Pope , for these are good men . Mott 's recovery from his breakdown coincided with the completion of his reading , and when Claggett and Pope returned to pick up the books , he told them , It was fun , this course of study you set me . Are you interested in my reactions ? ' Blaze away , ' Claggett said , imitating a machine gun . Shoot ' em down . ' First the negatives . Some of your best writers sound like real fascists . I suppose you know that . ' Some of the critics have been saying so , ' Claggett conceded . And some of them really despise women . ' So do some astronauts , ' Claggett said . So do some bullfighters . ' And they despise the world they 're forced to live in , this imperfect Earth . ' Do n't we all ? ' And all of them except Weinberg  --  You know , Claggett , I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . ' I guessed you 'd like him . I find him too sentimental . My type is more " Bang-bang , let 's atomize the planet Oom . " ' I was about to say they 're all extremely militaristic . Real gunslingers . ' A lot of good men are . Look how easy it is for the National Rifle Association to maintain membership . ' And they have almost no patience with the less fortunate . They 're elitist . ' So were you , when you sat on the selection committee . ' Worst of all , they 're strongly antidemocratic . Their first choice would be a one-man dictatorship , a Hitler or a Mussolini or a Stalin , cleaned up a bit . Second choice would be a benevolent king . Our kind of democracy would be far , far down the line . ' Science fiction is popular , ' Claggett said , because a whole lot of people are beginning to think along those lines . ' Final negative , the novels particularly , and many of the stories , are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy loving his horse , you fellows love your space machines . ' No comment . ' But the virtues of these books , ' Mott said , touching them with hisp385fingers , are many , and I can see why fellows like you , Claggett , find such enjoyment . They 're very well written . Wonderful touches . Strong insights . You know , when you brought these books in here I expected juvenile junk . But these are well done , at least as good as some of the novels I used to read when I had spare time . And to a gratifying degree , they all had something substantial to say . They really grappled with ideas . . . concepts . . . the things about to happen . In that respect they were damned refreshing . But now let 's get down to the nitty-gritty . ' Yes , ' Claggett said , I knew all you 've said so far twenty years ago . ' These men were far out on the frontier . They saw things that not even the NACA engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm stirred by how clearly the best of these writers could visualize what was about to happen . Nothing we 've been doing the last six years went unanticipated . ' That 's why I was so excited by these smoke dreams , ' Claggett said . I was far out in space , and my teachers were futzing around with one hundred miles up . I 've been one hundred miles up and it 's not even a beginning . The Moon ? Nothing . Send me to Mars . That 's the first real step . These men were doing my thinking for me . ' But in the midst of this praise we have to remember one thing . These men had a free ride . They never had to lay their lives or their reputations on the line . Men like me did not have that indulgence . We had to get a specific instrument weighing a given number of pounds to a given altitude and bring it back with all its telemetry functioning . We have to bring you two back with your telemetry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? ' Claggett asked . They were . But I suspect it was only a childish sort of fun . ' Is n't that the spirit we 're trying to keep alive ? ' Claggett asked , and when he grinned the gap between his broken front teeth appeared as if in the face of a delighted child reading one of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' books about the glamorous princesses on Mars . Gemini , the flight of the Twins , was best seen as a provisional program halfway between the exploratory one-man flights of Mercury and the culminatingthree-man flights of Apollo . It had five obligations which had to be discharged before the more important Moon flights could be attempted : I ) to prove that two men could survive extended flights ; 2 ) to compile information on the effect of weightlessness ; 3 ) to prove that man could walk in space and perform specific operational tasks of importance ; 4 ) to demonstratethat one spacecraft could rendezvous and dock with another ; and 5 ) when these jobs were completed , to bring the capsule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these desiderata had been handled more or less successfully byp386one or another of the previous Gemini flights , but the tour planned for Claggett and Pope would endeavor to bring them all together in one master demonstration . It would , for example , cover sixteen days of fairly constant experimentation . The spacecraft would seek out and dock with two different target ships left orbiting in space from previous docking attempts , Agena-A in low orbit , Agena-B in one much higher , and when docking was completedwith the latter , the Agena 's rocket would be fired in an attempt to soar higher than man had ever gone before . John Pope would spend seventeenhours walking in space , doing repair jobs on the two Agenas . And Claggett vowed that he would bring his Gemini to splashdown within a quarter of a mile of the USS Tulagi waiting west of Hawaii . The important flight had another overtone of which the two astronauts were especially aware . The six tremendously exciting flights of the one-man Mercury so far had been conducted by astronauts from the original Sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from the charismatic Second Group  --  Armstrong , Borman , Lovell , Young  --  with some help from three of the Sacred Seven , Cooper , Schirra and Grissom . The adventurous work had been handled by the old-timers , and many thought that it should continue to be . But Dr. Mott had argued strenuously , before his attack , that the lessdramaticmen from the Solid Six should also be given a chance , along with a few from the Third Group , like Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins . Randy Claggett had performed well in the right-hand seat of one flight , which had accomplished almost nothing because of parts failures , and his report on that mission was already a classic : Commander and pilot had accumulated a total of seven hundred hours in simulators and were as well prepared as they could normallyhave been . But at Allied Aviation in Los Angeles the people responsible for assembling the fuel tank ran into bad luck . I found that Mr. Bassett , who was responsible for the nonflammable lining , caught cold and was not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Krepke , was well prepared to stand in , but his wife went into labor pains three days early and he left . His assistant , Mr. Colvin , was in Seattle that day , consulting with Boeing , so the job was left to Mr. Swinheart , whose regular responsibility was the electrical wiring , and because he was so concerned about doing a good job on the lining , which he did backward , he forgot to check the wiring . His assistant , Mr. Untermacher , was absent that day because his eleven-year-old son was playing in a championship Little League game , so no word was passed to his assistant , a Mr. Sullivan , whom I did not see . As a result of the unfortunate omissions , the lining of the fuel tank was not secured and the electrical wiring was not given the finalp387inspection which would have shown even a high-school science teacher that the control switch would not work when activated . For these good reasons the **28;9802;TOOLONG flight could not go forward , and only because the commander had iron balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew for this culminating flight had been put together with studied care . Randy Claggett was a known factor , an unflappable test pilot who could bring to safety a seagull with two broken wings , and John Pope had the most reliable and solid record in the corps . He said little , always did twice as much as was required , and would have been voted by his fellow astronauts as the man they would prefer to have in the cockpit as their copilot , always assuming that it was they who sat in the left-hand seat . If the Solid Six could field a team with every chance of success , this was it , and everyone was pleased with the choice except Tucker Thompson , who had not even yet decided how to play these two difficult wives , Debby Dee and Penny . Debby Dee had stated that she would not come to Cocoa Beach and eat those sonnombeechin ' oysters at the Bali Hai , while Penny said quietly that she would of course stay in Washington and follow the launch on the television set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two astronauts had to master one final skill , a most beautiful and intricate exercise , and the scholars whose job it was to drill them in it now appreciated the fact that NASA had required superior intelligence in the men who would go into space . Claggett and Pope would be required to project themselves into universes which could be perceived only intellectually . Dr. Mott , in charge of this indoctrination , called the two men out to those vast salt flats surrounding Edwards Air Force Base , where he started with a simple two-dimensional experiment . Placing each man in a Jeep , with Pope well in front and Claggett trailing off to one side , he instructed them over headphones : Pope , maintain your heading without deviation in directionor speed . Steady fifty mph . Claggett , keep your eyes left and watch Pope 's Jeep until you have a sure sense of what it 's doing . Then accelerate to sixty-five mph and calculate a straight line that will carry you to a point where you feel sure you 'll intercept him . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert in calculatingin his head the trajectory which would probably enable him to intersect ; also , he could identify in advance the spot where the intersection wouldoccur . In fact , he became a human computer , feeding into the kinestheticpart of his brain the relevant data and almost intuitively getting the answer . Then Pope was placed in the pursuing Jeep , and in somewhat longertime than it had taken Claggett , he , too , converted himself into a computer.  |p388'You  're really quite remarkable , ' Mott told them . ' You 've acquired a very subtle coordination of eye , hand and foot for seeing , for steering and for acceleration . Both of you , in your last runs , achieved rendezvous in a straight line . But nothing you 've learned on these salt flats applies in space . ' Because when you transpose this problem into space , you add the complicating factor of altitude , and everything you 've learned changes . If you try by your own physical perceptions to bring your Gemini into rendezvous with your Agena , you 'll fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can come quite close . But at that moment you 'll be in an entirely different orbit  --  you going one way , Agena another , and you 'll pass slowly , beautifully , just out of range . ' He took the astronauts back to Edwards , and on a very big blackboard , drew a diagram which magically unlocked the system ; it was a perfect demonstration of how one intelligent man can convey to another arcane facts that might never be comprehended without the aid of a drawing : ' This big circle is the Earth . This is its center . This first blue circle outside the Earth is your initial orbit in Gemini . This red circle farther out is the orbit of Agena-A . The green circle way out is the orbit of Agena-B . Now watch . ' From the center of the Earth he drew radii , not too far apart , which intersected the four circles : Earth 's surface , Gemini orbit , the two Agena orbits , and with a very heavy line he emphasized on each circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to master is that the farther away from Earth you move , the slower your vehicle goes . When you 're a hundred miles up in this blue circle , your speed will be about seventeen thousand five hundred mph . In the red circle , at two hundred miles , about seventeen thousand two hundred fifty . And the Moon , which is also a spacecraft far off the diagram , has an orbital speed of only two thousand three hundred mph . Remember , if you stay low , you go faster . But also , if you stay down here in the blue circle closest to Earth , the total length of an orbit is much shorter . So if you stay low , you gain two ways , speed and distance covered . ' He paused , reviewed what he had been saying , and added , ' I want you to burn this diagram into your brains . Because successful rendezvous dependsupon understanding it . ' After they had analyzed every aspect of it , and had imagined themselves in their Gemini above the Earth but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mott resumed . At the points where the left-hand radius cut the three circles he placed little magnetic simulations of the three spacecraft , and began his extraordinary explanation : ' Let 's say that I am Agena-B way up here , Dr. Stanhope is Agena-A in middle position , and you two men are Gemini close in . You want to make rendezvous with me , all of us traveling at eighteen thousand miles an hour . What would you normally do , Clag-gett ? '  |p389'I  'd eyeball it , calculate where the point of interception was , and burn my engines to get to it . ' ' In other words , you 'd burn your fuel to ascend toward Agena-B ? ' ' Sure . ' ' Completely wrong . Look at the diagram . If you climb , you slow down as you move into a higher orbit . You 're bound to wind up far , far behind your target and then waste fuel trying to catch up . By going faster , you actually go slower . ' ' That sounds insane . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same orbit as Agena-B , but trailing . How will you catch up ? ' ' I 'm afraid to give you a sensible answer . ' ' To catch up , you slow down . Drop into a lower orbit , where you acquire a faster speed , and you gain rapidly on your target in the higher orbit . ' ' I ca n't believe it , ' Claggett said , but Pope , who had continued his study of astronomy and celestial mechanics , cried , ' Hey ! At the lower orbit , we 'd be on the circumference of a much smaller circle . ' ' Right , ' Mott said , ' and going faster , to boot . ' ' I 'll take that on faith , ' Claggett said . ' But how in hell do I ever get hooked up with that flyin ' sonnombeech ? If I burn toward it , I always miss . ' Mott clapped his hands . ' Randy , you 've learned the big lesson , ' and he drew other diagrams to illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Claggett asked , ' How will I ever find the proper orbit ? ' and Mott replied , ' You never would , not in a million years . But the computer will . ' The next maneuver that Mott proposed for his pupils was most complicated : ' Randy , you 're in Gemini down here and you must intercept Agena-B up here . Do n't go for the target . Burn straight ahead . Go faster to go slower . ' ' Doc , I understand that part . But what in hell do I do next ? ' ' As you move to a higher orbit , your speed will begin to drop off , and believe it or not , if you obey the figures your computer will be feeding you , you 'll bring your Gemini right in behind the target . The computer will time it so that when you 're about a hundred feet apart , your speeds will be identical , and so will your orbit . Then your twelve-year-old son could dock the two vehicles , because you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than the Agena , ease it into a docking . ' Claggett and Pope looked at each other , and the former said , with his bright Texas grin , ' Like the pretty girl said in My Fair Lady , " I think I got it . ' I believe the professor said that , ' Mott said . ' And to protect you , ' he added , ' we always time the docking so it occurs in the daylight part of the orbit . '  |p390Real  thoughtful , ' Claggett said . So think about the orbits tonight . Memorize the diagram . And keep telling yourself , " To go faster , I must go slower . " ' Next day he placed them again in their Jeeps , taking them to a remote part of the salt flats , where he had marked three concentric roadways . Claggett , you 're in Gemini orbit on the inside track . Pope , you 're Agena-A next out . I 'll be Agena-B farthest out . If we all start from the same radius , Gemini will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Remember , there 's a specific speed associated with each orbit . You , Claggett , on the inside , have to drive at sixty mph , Pope at fifty-five , and me at fifty . When I tell you over the headphones " Burn engines , " accelerate to sixty-five , but as you drift outward toward Pope 's orbit , your speed will decrease well below Pope 's , say to fifty . And that should put you in perfect position right behind him , which is what we want , is n't it ? ' Under radio communication the three Jeeps started forth , and when they were in position Mott instructed : Claggett , burn engines , but when you have speed , try moving directly up at Pope , in the old way . ' In three attempts , using the system that would have worked on land , Claggett failed miserably , so on the fourth try Mott suggested : Now try it the way we talked about . Burn straight ahead , pick up speed , then drift quietly up to Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sixty-five mph , drifted up , slowed down as he had been taught , and with a final adjustment , matched his speed to Pope 's in a perfect intercept . It can be done ! ' he shouted over the intercom , so for three hours the Jeeps moved back and forth in obedience to the new rules , until both Claggett and Pope could achieve rendezvous and docking while moving either up to a slower orbit or down to a faster . For two days the men repeated these maneuvers , after which Mott astonished them by saying , Now you must forget everything I 've taught you , because in space you 're not on a flat surface where ordinary rules apply . You 're in space , where eyeballing a problem does no good at all . The Russians have tried five times to make rendezvous and have failed every time , even though they show us photographs of their spaceships only a few leagues apart . They were on different orbits and they might as well have been ten thousand leagues apart , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the circles , Claggett , you must imagine yourself not going across a salt flat to catch Pope , but on a diagonal right up into the sky , and your eyes will not be reliable judges of where you are . ' What do I rely on ? ' Claggett asked . The computer . I 'll be your computer , talking to you over the head-phones . ' And when Claggett was seated in his Jeep , with the headphones adjusted , he could hear Mott 's metallic voice feeding him instructions , andp391rendezvous became so easy it was magnificent , a subtle adventure in nine or ten different dimensions . At the close of three additional days of drilling his two astronauts , Computer-Mott said with some pride , You men will complete a perfect rendezvous . ' But Randy , who became an automobile when he was driving or a plane when flying , had a gut premonition which warned him that he still lacked some vital understanding , and he asked , Doc , suppose that with all I know personally , the on-board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And suppose it goes out . There I am , bare-ass in space . Can I , with my own intelligence , eyeball it carefully and achieve rendezvous ? ' Not in a million years . ' Jesus ! Those computers better work . ' No sweat , because the duplicate computers in Houston can send you the required data . ' And if it 's my bad day , and the radio goes out , too ? ' Mott studied this for some time , forming diagrams in space with his fingers . Knowing you , Randy , you 'd make one futile try , then another , then another . And when you realized that since they failed , all the rest would fail , you 'd bellow " Aw shit ! " and drift off into space . . . permanently ... forever . ' And it was only then that the two astronauts appreciated the delicate symbiosis of man-machine-computer that would enable them to make this flight and this rendezvous . At 0415 on Tuesday morning the two astronauts were awakened in the isolation quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles , for if they came into contact with either , the sixteen-day flight might have to be aborted . Dressed in slacks and T-shirts they had a carefully evaluated breakfast calculated to produce a minimum of urine and fecal matter . When the time came for assistants to dress them , and they climbed into the ingenious underwear with its arrangements for handling urine and bowel movements , Claggett studied the condom-like affair that fitted over his penis and was reminded of the story about how Winston Churchill had rescued the honor of the Allies at the meeting with Stalin at Teheran : Stalin wanted to throw a psychological scare into the Americans , so he said to Roosevelt in private , " Our greatest need to keep the morale of our fighting men high is rubbers . We just do n't have any . " And Roosevelt told him grandly , " We 'll send you five hundredp392thousand . What size ? " Without blinking , Stalin said , " Sixteen inches long . Our standard size . " Roosevelt confided that night to Churchill that Stalin was throwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . " Make ' em up and send ' em . But stamp each one , in English and Russian , Texas medium . " ' Claggett told his dresser that for his urine-catcher , my motorman 's friend ' he called it , he would take a Texas super , and the dresser said , You do that , my bucko , and you 'll be lying in piss the whole flight . ' At dawn the two astronauts , fully suited , climbed with help into a waiting white van , which moved quietly past lines of people who had come to see the launch and across the marshes where alligators spawned , to the rim island where the majestic Titan rocket waited on end , with the almost minute passenger capsule on top . The entire assembly reached 109 feet into the air , and seemed enormous as the first rays of the sun broke upon it , but when the waiting spectators , two hundred thousand of them , focused on only the capsule , they were aghast at how trivial it seemed , only nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus in flight , 8z percent of the total vehicle would break away and plunge into the sea . The two men and their helpers moved with utmost precision because of a peculiarity of this flight : since they desired to make rendezvous with two different Agenas parked long ago in two different orbits , trajectory specialistslike Dr. Mott had had to calculate to the second the proper moment for blast-off at Canaveral so that the Gemini capsule would reach the precise altitude ( 116 miles straight up ) at the precise speed ( i8,000 miles an hour ) at the precise moment ( 85 minutes i6 seconds after takeoff ) . Also , the relative position of the second Agena had to be cranked into the data , and when this was done , it was found that Claggett and Pope had a window for proper takeoff of only nine seconds , which meant that all things had to come together properly for ignition within a nine-second interval , and if for any reason it was missed , the astronauts would have to wait another eleven days . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting with his charts and his computer , had said , The optimum allows us a window of exactly two seconds , within the endurable nine . If we miss the two , we can still go , but we 'll have to waste a lot of fuel to correct . ' If one remembered the endless delays of the early rocket flights , the sad disappointments of men sitting alone in their capsules atop some giant rocket for hours at a time , and the repeated postponements of the same rocket , so that no flight seemed ever to take off within hours of the time planned , the probability of getting this rocket off within a two-second window seemed remote . An elevator carried the men up the gantry , alongside the glistening bodyp393of the rocket and onto the walkway that provided entrance to the capsule , and now the endless hours of stimulation paid off , because had the two men seen their prison for the next sixteen days cold turkey , and realized that they would have to lie side-by-side in that minute space for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man allowed himself even to think of claustrophobia , he would be incapacitated . The space was so unbelievably cramped that when the astronauts were suited up in those bulky white Eskimo outfits , they lay literally touching , even pressing upon each other , in their narrow couches . Claggett , as commander , slipped into the porthole first , adjusted himself to the sloping bed conformed in a soft , sturdy material to his particular body , then gave the signal for Pope to ease himself into the right-hand seat , and when all the elbows and knees and hips were adjusted , the two men occupied a space shockingly smaller than a very narrow single bed , and much shorter , too , for heads and toes exactly touched the limits of the capsule 's interior . Men had been fitted into a specific contour for a specific mission to answer a specific question : Can two healthy men survive and work in such surroundings for sixteen days ? The hatch was closed and bolted shut . The bodies were eased this way and that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countdown , and the two-second window approached . ' You have ignition , ' CapCom said steadily . ' You have lift-off , ' and it was good that he told them , for the men in the capsule atop the mighty rocket could barely feel the moment of firing , so smooth were the engines with their 430,000 pounds of upward thrust , sustained for moment after moment . ' Gentle as a baby 's kiss , ' Claggett reported , and then , with unbelievable persistence , the powerful engines kept thrusting upward , ever more powerfully , until at last the astronauts realized they were truly on their way to space . Now the first stage of the rocket shut down , and for tantalizing seconds  --  hours it seemed  --  the rocket continued its climb in silence , but then the powerful second stage blasted off with uo , 000 pounds of thrust , and this force acting on the relatively frail Gemini produced a sudden impact of seven full G 's , so that Pope was jammed back into his contoured couch . ' Sayonara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mission Controlrealized that this was a phrase of farewell , elegantly appropriate , which Cindy Rhee had taught him . ' Houston ! ' Pope broke in . ' We have pogo . ' ' We see it , Gemini , ' CapCom said . It was a tradition that when astronautswere cooped in their tiny quarters , hundreds of miles from anythingand thousands of miles into an orbit , only one person on ground must be allowed to communicate with them lest there be confusion in commands or a babel of voices , and that one person must be a fellow astronaut , preferably one who had already flown . Each flight tended to have four CapComs , coming on at intervals , and it was a second tradition that thep394CapCom maintain a steady volume , a steady emphasis , a kind of bland streetcar-conductor tone , so that no accidental excitement be transferred across the vast spaces . How much pogo ? ' CapCom asked quietly . Vibration pronounced , ' Pope reported . There was nothing that could be done to alleviate the bone-shattering pogo-stick leaping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordion player were activating the Titan rocket and its Gemini capsule . And here was an anomaly of NASA . With the best brains in the world , it was as yet unable to prevent pogo or even to determine exactly what caused it . The violent , shaking contractions had appeared in the first Geminiflight and had continued through the tenth . Now it was assaulting this flight , and all the brilliance of NASA could not diminish it . The men could only hold tight and hope that it would go away , and after a while it did . Stand by for engine shutdown , ' CapCom said . He was the final link in a tremendous chain of persons and machines around the world . At Mission Control in Houston hundreds of highly skilled men traced every item of the flight with their computers and charts . At radio stations in Australia , Spain , Madagascar and across America men listened to signals which assured them that this Gemini was sailing serenely , and on all the oceans ships kept silent watch . Also , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had supplied parts for the flight , men waited on call to provide immediate analysis if one of their parts failed to function , and in some ways they were the most expert of all , because they had made the parts and were intimately familiar with them . Finally , at each of the many simulators in Houston or Canaveral or the other sites across America , men familiar with their operation waited in case it was necessary to visualize just what was going wrong in the capsule . At a signal , they would jump into the simulators and feed in data which would place them in a jeopardy imitating the one aloft . When Ferdinand Magellan explored the Earth 's oceans he and his men traveled alone in their frail ships , out of touch for years with their supportersin Spain , but when Claggett and Pope sought to explore the oceans of the upper sky they had immediate call upon about four hundred thousand assistants , and at times it was difficult to determine who was doing the exploring , Claggett and Pope or the men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their commands . When pogo stopped , as mysteriously as it had begun , shutdown followed and the time came for Claggett to detonate the explosives which would separate the Titan rocket from the capsule , and after checking with Houston , he did so at the exact second dictated by the computer that was masterminding this intricate flight . There was a shattering explosion , a ripping away and a violent change in acceleration , after which the little capsule floated serenely into a nearly circular orbit , 116.7 X 164.6 milesp395above the surface of the Earth . Somewhere ahead lay the first target , Agena-A . Now began one of the most curious experiences of mankind in recent decades . Agena-A was locked into its own secure orbit , which it had been following blindly , coldly for more than a year , and it was the job of this particular Gemini to enter that orbit , to fall in line behind the target , and slowly overtake it , thrusting the nose of the Gemini into the tail of Agena-A and making a lock , all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , but it was made immeasurably more so by the fact that an added dimension of complexity had to be taken into account . At 00:02:21:36 into the flight ( **26;9832;TOOLONG ) Claggett informed Houston : I see the little stinker , ' and Mike Collins at CapCom said quietly , We find you thirteen miles below and twenty-two miles ahead , ' and Pope responded , Our computer says exactly the same . ' Coolly , as if he had performed the feat a hundred times , which in a sense he had , Randy made a series of the most delicate adjustments , which brought his spacecraft gently upward , at 18,000 miles an hour , until it found the orbit Agena-A was following . Deftly he edged the massive Gemini forward until it was close to the speeding target . Houston , ' Pope said triumphantly . Would you believe it ? At 02:22:07 into the flight we 've made perfect rendezvous . ' Proceed to dock , ' CapCom said , and then a miracle of space occurred . The Gemini , traveling at an incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the Agena , weighing 1,700 pounds and also traveling at fantastic speed , and with the delicacy of a surgeon sewing together a torn heart , Claggett brought the two craft together and made a secure lock . The secret was simple : if both craft were flying at the same basic speed , docking was as easy as moving a car into a garage , for the relative speed could be kept to two or three miles an hour . They docked and undocked three times to prove the practicality of this maneuver , and then Claggett told Houston : I want the right-hand seat to make the dock next time , ' and CapCom , a new man now but an astronaut , agreed : Roger . ' And Pope , with his heartbeat showing a slight increase on the monitor at Houston , eased his Gemini into position , then edged it forward , and made a perfect rendezvous . The pathway to the Moon was open ; men could take two or more vehicles into space and rendezvous them , if their computers could place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this very long flight the astronauts had agreed to keep their watches on Houston time , CST , and as this first long day ended after its flawless takeoff within the two-second window and the even more gratifying docking with Agena-A , the men went to sleep . Their craft was within two miles of Agena , but round and round the Earth they sped , these two massive vehicles , making a complete circuit of a twenty-four-hour Earth day of **26;9860;TOOLONG hour and twenty-six minutes . And as they lay there , sleeping fitfully , they became indeed twins . If onep396rolled over , the other did also , because neither wished to breathe in the other 's face . They had to plan every action so that it would not interfere with the man in the next couch , and even when one had to relieve himself , he did so with his face less than a foot from his companion 's . And this would continue for sixteen days . By the third day the Twins had adjusted rather well to their cramped quarters . Everything movable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and often the men gave thanks to that genius who invented Velcro , the miracle fabric with a million fingers that enabled them to attach pens and compasses and data books arbitrarily to any spot on the interior surface which had been covered with Velcro . The capsule looked like a room in the dollhouse of a very careless child . They had almost no trouble with null gravity , except that they had to be extremely careful when they ate , lest crumbs float permanently about them . Liquids , if spilled , formed beautiful droplets , or if in large quantity , globules the size of a fist . But even in these first days they began to appreciatewhat Dr. Julius Feldman , their expert on health in space , had told them : The most dangerous part of weightlessness , especially in a Gemini capsule , is the fact that you do n't exercise your legs . Let them remain motionless long enough and your muscles will atrophy so badly that they 'll be too weak to support you when you try to walk after splashdown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a device into which they could slip their feet and against which they could exert extreme pressures , thus providing the exercise the legs were not otherwise getting . Fortunately , such vigorous effort also diminished the likelihood of embolisms forming in the legs . For the astronauts flew flat on their backs , day after day , with not nearly enough headroom , considering the couches and gear , to permit walking about . But they were able to climb out of their heavy suits , with extreme difficulty , taking about forty minutes to do the job , so that they flew in loose garments in relative comfort . It was interesting for one man to watch another emerge from his suit and stow it painfully under his couch . Hello , Chrysalis , ' Claggett greeted Pope after one such exercise , and the latter broke into laughter as he said , I was thinking about those poor soft-shell crabs in the Chesapeake . Penny and I gorged on them when I was at Annapolis . The poor things struggle like this to get out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook plops them into a hot pan and sautes them . ' How do you and Penny hack it , you in Houston , she in Washington ? ' We 're a Navy family . Lots of good people live like us . ' She 's mighty good people . When she first stayed with us on Solomons Island , I found her a mite aloof . ' I find her that way myself , sometimes . She holds down a complex job , you know ? ' She has class . She has mighty class . She 's gon na be somebody one of these days . '  |p397She  's somebody now . Randy , have you heard anything about Inger Jensen ? ' Two kids , Army pension . What else do you need to know ? ' How long was Debby Dee a widow before you married her ? ' Six months , eight months . ' I hope somebody like you comes along for Inger . ' I 'd like to come along for that one . But I do n't think I was such a catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse 's ass . ' Pope did not ask in what ways , for he often felt the same way about himself . On the sixth day Pope 's time of testing approached , for he was required to climb into a special suit , strap cumbersome gear to his back , leave the capsule , and retrieve from the flank of Agena-A a dosimeter ( dose meter ) which had been left there a year earlier to monitor the amount of radiation accumulated by men voyaging in space . While walking , he would be attached to the mother craft by an umbilical which would bring him oxygen and he would carry a small kit of tools with which to work on the Agena . It required more than an hour , with constant help from Claggett , to don the suit , and an unexpected fifteen minutes to wrestle open the door to the hatchway from which he would exit , but before this could be completed , Randy had to get into his spacesuit also , for once the hatch was opened , it would remain that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both men would be in space , the difference being that Randy would remain inside the shell of the capsule . This preliminary part of the exercise required much more time and energy than Pope had calculated , because in the simulators on Earth , things had gone rather more smoothly , and for a simple reason : the simulator existed in one G , so that by merely leaning an elbow against something , one gained stability ; but in null gravity , if one pushed his elbow against a wall , even slightly , one sent his body spinning across the room and he could not stop his aimless flight until he succeeded in grasping something , which was why every astronaut who returned from space told those who debriefed him : More handholds . More footclamps . ' At last both astronauts were suited and the hatch opened . Outside waited the boundless reach of space , that colorless , weightless , formless medium in which the universe exists with all its stars and galaxies and mighty conformations as yet unknown to man . How majestic it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway , he was like an infant about to leave the womb which had been so pleasant and enter the world which would be so infinitely more exciting . To the east , as he calculated his position , although this term meant little , blazed the incredible Sun , wasting energy at a rate which must imperil it after another fifteen or twenty billion years , poor fated thing . It stood at the margin between Capricornus and Aquarius and thus obliterated Pope 's guardian star , Altair , and its bright associate Vega . To the west , or awayp398from the Sun , shone the dark night with the glorious winter constellations in view : Orion , the Lion and the one that watched over this flight , Gemini . No astronaut who went into space would know more about the stars than Pope , and now as he prepared to walk among them he greeted them as if they had always been his counselors , and took quiet delight in the fact that he would see those southern constellations which his first professor , Anderssenof Fremont State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 say hello for him to Achernar and Miaplacidus . ' Most impressive of all , below rode the planet Earth , its features ascertainablewhen in daylight , barely suggested when its spinning carried onehalfthe surface into darkness . How big it seemed at times , how small now as Pope looked down upon it from a distance : Hey , Randy . It really is a planet . ' Jump , you chicken . ' And he was off into space . He moved with all four extremities slightly extended , like a falling parachute diver , but he did not fall , for there was no gravity to command him , or rather , as he had phrased it to himself so many times : There is gravity from every item in the universe , even my wife 's teacup exerts its gravity upon the Galaxy Andromeda , but it does n't factor very much . Of course , the Earth 's mass , slightly less than two hundred miles distant , continued to exert enormous gravitational pull , but it was so delicately counterbalanced by the centrifugal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of any detectable gravitational effects . He was aware that he had started the EVA ( Extra Vehicular Activity ) rather tired , so he moved cautiously in his approach to the waiting Agena , and he supposed that when he reached the monster he would find time to rest , but when he got there he found himself confronted by an entirely new problem . There was nothing he could grab hold of , and when he endeavored to fasten himself to the huge , slippery target he merely drifted about , bruising his knees and elbows as he struggled vainly to hold fast . After a half-hour of this he was sweating so furiously that his face mask began to steam , so he slowed down , but then he remembered that he was supposed to detach the dosimeter from the Agena and bring it back to Earth , so he moved awkwardly along the hulk till he reached the three bolts holding it . And then he faced a new problem , for when he took from his kit the special monkey wrench and fitted it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . If he applied pressure to the wrench handle , hoping thus to apply torque to the nut , he found that since he had no purchase , it was he and not the nut that revolved . No matter how simple the task he attempted , whenever he exerted force in one direction , his body flew off in the opposite . For twenty minutes he tried vainly to perform the planned task , and accomplished nothing . Tears of frustration came to his eyes and fogged hisp399visor , and all the joy of walking free in space was dissipated ; what was worse , he was becoming so dangerously debilitated that he must in common prudence pull himself back to the capsule before he became so totally exhausted that Claggett would have to undertake the impossible task of maneuvering an inert mass . ' I 'm coming in , ' he told his partner . ' You 're scheduled for thirty-four more minutes . ' ' I 'm coming in or you 'll have to come out and get me , ' and when he reached the hatchway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and he rested there for nearly half an hour until he recovered his strength . ' It 's no picnic out there , ' he said when he got his helmet off in the repressurized capsule . ' Next time better luck , ' Claggett said . As commander of this flight he refused to accept defeat on any point , but he also knew that Pope had been near collapse . He devised an interesting amusement for the next flight walk . When the astronauts accumulated a body of refuse , including bags of urine , they vented it through an ingenious system of locks , and in doing so one morning  --  Houston time , because in this orbit a kind of morning occurred every hour and twenty-six minutes  --  some of the ejecta had smeared Claggett 's window and he complained about it so constantly that on the spur of the moment Pope said , ' I 'll go out and give it a wash , ' which was what Claggett had intended . This time the space walk was a huge success , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last in the series , had been modified by McDonnell to provide some sixteen extra handholds and footclamps . Now Pope had something to wedge himself against so that he could use the flattened expanse of his body to counterbalance the return thrust of whatever he was working upon , and in this way he was able to apply torque without having it spin him around . Also , by moving himself to the opposite side of the craft , he could give Claggett 's window an effective cleaning . That night the two men talked at length with Houston to see if anyone could devise some way that would enable Pope to retrieve the dosimeter , and CapCom said quietly , ' Dr. Feldman is most eager for you to retrieve it . Data are badly needed on the accumulation of radiation in space , ' and Pope replied , ' Give me some guidance , ' so three astronauts hurried to the deep swimming pool at Huntsville , and after suiting up and applying weights to their belts , achieved the sensation of null gravity and went underwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They suggested that Pope try establishing leverage by hooking his left foot in a hold he had overlooked , by approaching the nuts from a different angle , and by keeping his belly , one leg and one elbow disposed so as to distribute his weight differently : ' We think this will allow you to apply torque . ' He went to sleepp400at what they had agreed to call night , swearing to Claggett , If I have to use my teeth , I 'm going to loosen those bolts , ' but Claggett had a better idea : I think we stowed a tiny can of oil somewhere in here , and I want you to go over one hour early and soup ' em up . ' Next morning the two men dressed extremely slowly , allowing no perspirationto accumulate , and then they opened the hatch with a minimum of effort , and Pope , taking very slow breaths to control his respiration , left the capsule carrying almost nothing except the tiny can of oil , which he applied to the bolts before returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but simply held on , drifting across Africa and Australia , to whose communicators he spoke . I feel great , ' he assured Claggett , and when the latter handed him the tool kit , he set off for the Agena with real enthusiasm . Positioning himself astride the huge craft as the Houston men had advised , he found that by grasping it with one foot , one knee , one elbow and gut , he could achieve a kind of leverage , so that when he began to twist the lubricated nuts , they moved and not he . Semper fidelis ! ' he called to Claggett as he unbolted the dosimeter , stowing it carefully in a pouch attached to his belt , but when it worked free , one bolt fell away . . . well , it certainly did n't fall away , for there was no gravity to attract it , but it slid out of his control and moved away from the Agena , impelled by his futile attempt to retrieve it , and there it drifted like a minute planet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , 4,108.9 miles above the molten center . Six days had now passed , and the next three were spent uneventfully discharging tasks which had been set by the ground experts , especially the space scientists . This series required the most exact timing , collection of data and attention : ... Study the effects of weightlessness on neurospora to see if any genetic damage is done by extended voyages in space . ... Make 149 photographs of different Earth terrains using the Maurer camera . ... Make 36 photographs of gegenschein , the faint nebulosity which appears opposite the Sun in certain conditions . ... Investigate the L-4 and L-5 equilibrium points of the EarthMoonsystem to determine whether clouds of particulate matter have collected as predicted by LaGrange in 1772 . ... Check UHF-VHF polarization as it affects radio transmission through the atmosphere . ... Accumulate data on frog-egg growth in space.  | ... Do bioassays of body fluids , which meant urinating into a special bag . ( But this study failed because Claggett broke his bag twice . The medics were sure he did it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stowed every piece of movable gear , fastening pens and cups to the walls with Velcro , against the violent shock which they would soon receive . Checking with Houston , they reassured themselves that Agena-B , the one with ample fuel and good engines , was about twenty miles behind them , so they speeded up sharply in order to fall back , and as soon as they attained a higher orbit , the Agena , below them , started moving ahead . When it was well in the lead , they slowed down so that their relative speed would increase , and sure enough , they came right in on target , making a docking so perfect they could not feel the join . Houston , we 're ready for fire . ' Everything is go , ' CapCom said , and with that vote of confidence , Claggett fired the powerful main engine of the Agena , which the Twins were facing , and for a full twenty-nine seconds a wild explosion of fire and flying fragments engulfed the capsule as the men felt six G 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles per hour , the whole assembly shot away from Earth until it reached an orbit of 748.3 miles , higher than any man had gone before . Holy cow ! ' Claggett cried into the mike . Houston , that was some sleigh ride . ' And then , with the world listening , he added a most unfortunate afterthought : If God was a golfer and made an approach shot like that with a niblick , He would be cheering . ' Thousands of religious listeners felt that he had blasphemed , and NASA would spend hours and days denying that that had been his intention . God is not a golfer , ' one of the journals said in harsh rebuke , and Thompson would have difficulty preventing Claggett from responding , Well , if He is , He made a great niblick shot on that one . ' Pope was more restrained , and his enthusiastic words were piped eagerlyinto the worldwide communications system , to be heard instantaneouslyin the very parts of Earth about which he was speaking : Oh , how magnificent the Earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts on the way back . The line between night and day down there is as clean as a knife edge . Oh ! Oh ! There 's Africa exactly as it should be . And the oceans are blue and I see Asia coming up . Oh , the Himalayas . You should see the beauty of our Earth . ' It was his casual , tourist photographs , more than two hundred of them made at this great height , that first showed the people of Earth what their planet looked like and what majestic colors it commanded , and the precious thing it was . And at the apogee of their flight , when the Agena was shudderinginto permanent orbit , Claggett cried to all the Earth : I wish we could go on forever . ' The Twins landed in the Pacific Ocean , 781 yards downstream of the Tulagi. where they had been ordered to land sixteen days and 7,000,000p402miles ago , and at the debriefing the men voiced only two complaints . Pope : Claggett took country music on his tapes , and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Claggett : John took what he claimed was Bach and Bartok , and I do n't never want to hear no more of that spaghetti music . ' The Claggett-Pope flight was so successful in every detail , except the collection of urine , that the Gemini program was allowed quietly to phase out . It had served its purposes splendidly , and its cost of $1,147,300,000 had been amply repaid , for Gemini proved that men could survive handsomely in zero G if they exercised their legs , that they could take two monster craft aloft and join them as gently as if they were baby carriages , that they could walk in space and complete tasks if , like Archimedes , they could only find a fulcrum , and that a trip to the Moon was only an extension of the flight that Claggett had contemplated when he cried , I wish we could go on forever . ' And then the goodies began falling into the laps of the Twins . They addressed a joint session of Congress , had ticker-tape parades , were sent to seven foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmonauts , and were offered free automobiles and enticing real estate deals . But what was really significant , having proved their professionalism , they found it much easier to get T-38s when they wanted them , and in these sleek , swift jets they sped from one part of the country to another , making practical suggestions for the Apollo program that would soon carry them to the Moon . The Greek word is hubris , the central theme of the great tragedians . It designates that pride and insolence which infuriates the gods and causes them to strike men down at the height of their success . Hubris had invaded the NASA program , and on the afternoon of 21 February 1967 , when three astronauts were running through a routine drill in their capsule atop a Saturn rocket at Canaveral , an unguarded electrical wire threw a spark into the pure oxygen of the cabin , and the resulting fire cremated the men . The surviving Solid Six were at the Bali Hai when this occurred , and as the news spread through the community the families clustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a NASA plane , and the ten young people sat in the Dagger Bar  --  the Claggetts , the Lees , the Bells , the Caters , the Popes  --  reflecting on the inexorable movement of which they were a part , while in a corner Rhee Soon-Ka sat , unobserved , taking notes , for this was the kind of day she had long anticipated : as a modern Aeschylus , she knew what hubris was.  |p403ONLY  ONCE DID THE FOUR FAMILIES SO INTRICATELY INVOLVED INAmerica 's space program meet together in one place at one time , and that occurred in the Longhorn Motel in a dusty suburb of Houston , Texas , during the climactic July in 1969 when astronauts finally walked on the Moon . In preceding years , of course , the men had met one another but never in concert . For example , Senator Grant had known John Pope as a boy in his hometown and had helped get him into Annapolis ; he had often consultedwith Stanley Mott , sometimes on personal matters ; and he had twice summoned Kolff to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had never seen the three together . No one of the wives had ever seen all of the other three , not even Penny Pope , who might have been expected to . She had certainly met with the senator 's wife , for the two women had grown up in the same town , and she 'd had many occasions for meeting Rachel Mott , but she had never gone down to Alabama to meet Liesl Kolff , who had never ventured into Washington . In fact , the only wife Liesl Kolff knew was Rachel Mott , whom she loved like a younger sister . The families should have met a few days earlier at the Cape Canaveral launch of Apollo II ; the four men had of course been there to discharge official duties , but two of the wives , Elinor Grant and Liesl Kolff , had preferred staying home . The meeting between Stanley Mott and Dieter Kolff , after seven years of strained separation during which each man had concentrated on his own unique problems , was an emotional one , for Dieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , ran forward to embrace the man who had saved him . ' Stanley , what an hour of triumph for you ! ' Mott clasped the engineer and said , ' The triumph is yours , old fellow ! That day I found you in Germany you promised : " I 'll send a rocket to the Moon . " And in a few hours we 'll be there , your rocket and my man . '  |p404The  bitterness returned , and Dieter said , Not my rocket . It wo n't get there . You chose the other solution , the wrong one . ' Mott , not wishing to reopen that old wound , asked brightly , Where 's Liesl ? ' and Dieter said , She was afraid to come . ' For many years Liesl Kolff had wanted to see the installations in which her husband spent so much of his time , but she had been apprehensive of participating in the gala celebrations which attended the launch in Florida : I 'd be out of place . All those expensive wives in their expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston , the very center of space activity , she still demurred . She would have preferred Boston , where her son Magnus had been offered a summer job with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston SymphonyPops , with the promise that if he passed rigid tests , he would be given the position of second trumpet for the winter season of 1970 and those to follow . Magnus had known of his mother 's dilemma and over the telephone from Boston had told her : Go to Texas , Mom . You can see me anytime the next ten years . I 'm determined to win the permanent job . ' On the night when the astronauts were supposed to land on the Moon he would face his major test : solo part in Stradella 's lyric Concerto in D Major for Trumpet . Please , Mom , go to Houston with Father . ' She complied , and was delighted with the Longhorn Motel and the respect shown her husband . Senator Grant had been ordered by President Nixon to be in Florida for the launch and now in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As one White House staffer pointed out : The damned Democrats have been trying to steal this show for years . Kennedy , Johnson , Glancey . You 're our top Republican in the program , Norman , and the President wants you to be damned visible . ' The young man had added , They 'll make it a highly social affair , with lots of photography and television . Be sure to take your wife . ' On the Florida trip Grant had been unable to persuade Elinor to come along ; she insisted upon staying home , and for a very good reason : on the Monday before lift-off she had received from Dr. Strabismus an urgent telegram informing her , and a select handful of other $72 subscribers , exactly what was happening : Do not be alarmed if the tottering American government tries to place a man on the Moon . This has been orchestrated by those Visitors who infiltrated NASA seven years ago , as I warned you at the time . Ordinary American scientists could not possibly have solved the difficult problems involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informants within the Visitor ranks assure us that very secure colonies have been established by them on the dark side of the Moon , away from our telescopes , and that when our men try to land , every assistance will be given . This will ensure that the . attempt will bep405successful , because the Visitors want us to be preoccupied with the Moon while they finalize their assumption of power in Washington . These are critical days , but do not be deceived by the Moon landing . The really important event will be the impending takeover in Washington , London , Rome and Tokyo . Elinor had felt that she could probably help the nation most by staying in Clay to cooperate with the Visitors , so she missed the excitement of the lift-off , viewed by more than a million people lining the Florida roads , but when the White House itself telephoned to urge her to attend the celebrationsin Houston which would accompany a successful Moon landing , she had to listen . Calling the headquarters of USA in Los Angeles , she asked Dr. Strabismus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave home on the eve of the Visitors ' takeover , and he said it would be all right , for they had assured him that it would be peaceful . So she joined her husband at the Longhorn Motel . Rachel Mott was still shepherding the wives of her astronauts , but since the emphasis would now be on the families of the men about to attack the Moon , she had free time to be with her husband , and she needed the semivacation . She had been spending long hours with her son Christopher , who seemed to thrive under the relaxing Florida sun . He had been suspendedfrom the University of Maryland for grades that were abominably low , but she felt sure that the stabilizing influence of family life would enable him to resume his studies . She wanted him to accompany her to Houston , but he had preferred staying in Florida , where he would be attending anti-Vietnam rallies in Miami . When Penny Pope brought her senators back to Washington after the hugely successful launch of Apollo ii , tough-minded Mike Glancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Nixon 's insisting that Elinor Grant attend the Moon-landing celebration at Houston . She 's as crazy as a bedbug and it 's your job to see she stays undercover . ' When Penny protested that she was not a baby-sitter , Glancey growled , This time you are . There would be hell to pay if European newspapers got hold of the fact that a leading member of our Space Committee had a fruitcake wife who was peddling state secrets to little green men . ' It would be Penny 's job to keep Mrs. Grant isolated until either the shot succeeded or the little men took over . At half past eleven on this dramatic day , when the temperature outside was a boiling ninety-six , the four couples sat down to lunch in a reserved corner of the Longhorn bar . Two televisions had been brought in at Senator Grant 's request so that he and his guests could listen to both Walter Cronkite and John Chancellor , and after two rounds of cocktails , which John Pope and Liesl Kolff refused , the euphoric lunch began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , having been indoctrinatedfrom her earliest days in El Paso with the belief that one could eat oysters safely only in months containing an r.
