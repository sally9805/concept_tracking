One morning last week , in a dining room atop the Time &; Life Building in New York City , nine of TIME 'S editors , correspondents and writers assembled for breakfast and a conversation with Mexico 's Foreign Minister , Bernardo Sepulveda Amor . For more than an hour , Sepulveda answered questions about his country 's relations with the U.S. , and about the unrest in Central America . By the time the last coffees were finished , the TIME hosts had received yet another reminder that , as Chief of Correspondents Richard Duncan says , " Leaders and their informal conversations are usually much more interesting than their official statements . " <P> Scores of U.S. and foreign officials are invited for similar informal encounters . At these small gatherings , the people who report the news at TIME get a wider picture of the people who make it . The receptions are held throughout the year , but take on an added bustle in the first weeks of autumn , when government leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sepulveda , TIME journalists met with the President of Argentina ( in this case , at his New York City hotel ) , the Prime Minister of Lebanon , and the foreign ministers of Australia , Austria and Jordan . <P> In addition to government leaders , opposition figures are invited to dine . Shimon Peres visited 3 two years ago as leader of Israel 's Labor opposition . This week he is scheduled to return as his country 's Prime Minister . El Salvador 's President Jose Napoleon Duarte has visited , and so has Salvadoran Rebel Spokesman Ruben Zamora . <P> TIME 'S editors met last year with Daniel Ortega Saavedra , a leader of Nicaragua 's Sandinista government , and also with his contra guerrilla opponent , Eden Pastora Gomez . The exchanges can be remarkably frank , as was the case with Nicaragua 's Ortega . ( In a gracious prelude to a hard-hitting conversation , he presented Time Inc . Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald and TIME Managing Editor Ray Cave with a painting by a Nicaraguan artist . ) <P> Often TIME 'S staff members invite distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau Chief William Mader helped to bring in West Germany 's then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt . Onetime Paris Bureau Chief Henry Muller invited French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson . As Senior Editor Muller puts it , " Hearing someone present a policy in person , regardless of what other information or analysis you have , helps you to understand that policy better .
