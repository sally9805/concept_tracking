But mesmerizing speeches are rare nowadays in the US Senate . Usually one looks up from a near-deserted floor to the reporter ' s gallery only to see a few forlorn reporters working crossword puzzles or flipping through notes from an earlier interview , while on the floor below two or three senators slowly walk the aisles in what appears little like a legislative body . It has become a tired joke to refer sarcastically to the Senate as ' ' the world ' s greatest deliberative body. ' ' // Where is the forum today for a serious deliberation of this country ' s very serious business ? There are the talk shows and the op-ed articles , but there is no one forum where the country ' s business is focused , where debates of importance are guaranteed to center the public ' s attention. // // What would happen if the Senate chose to open its deliberations to television ? The Senate Rules Committee is scheduled to hold hearings on the issue tomorrow and Wednesday . Unlike the House of Representatives , the Senate works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he wants about anything he likes . With an atmosphere calmer and more reasoned than in the House of Representatives , the Senate is perhaps the only place - with the exception of the presidential debates every four years - where true national debates can be conducted . Why hasn ' t the Senate opened its doors ? // It ' s not the first time the question has been raised . One of the initial questions faced by the first Senate - in 1789 - was whether to open its sessions to the public . The Constitution was silent on the matter , and the Senate began its debates closed to all outsiders , press and public alike. // The public , and the press , soon began to conjure images of dark ' ' monarchical ' ' schemes being hatched behind closed doors , and a clamor for an open Senate began. // The arguments put forth in that summer of 1789 bear an uncanny resemblance to the arguments being heard today over television . The foremost argument then and now is the fear that senators would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric than with carrying on the public ' s business in an expeditious manner . It is no wonder that senators in 1789 feared this . When they walked past the chambers of the House of Representatives they could hear the galleries in tumult , with visitors cheering on their favorite speakers and striking their canes on the floor with shouts of ' ' Bravo ! ' ' // President Washington sensed this in a letter to a friend : ' ' Why they keep their doors shut , when acting in a Legislative capacity , I am unable to inform you ; unless it is because they think there is too much speaking to the Gallery in the other House , and business thereby retarded. ' ' // Many senators spoke openly of this fear , but some doubts were advanced only privately . ' ' You know I am not a friend to mystery and hypocrisy , ' ' wrote Sen. Paine Wingate in a private letter . ' ' But there are certain foibles which are inseparable from men and bodies of men and perhaps considerable faults which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little domestic transactions of even the best regulated family appear if exposed to the world ? ' ' // But the public was adamant . Even though the Revolution had been fought and won and a new Constitution adopted , there was still much suspicion - mostly justified - among everyday people in America that the forces of aristocracy were alive and well , especially in the Senate whose members were not even elected by the public but appointed by the various legislatures. // Those fears must have been inflamed when the Senate , in one of its first official acts , adopted a resolution stating that the title for the chief executive ought to be ' ' His Highness , the President of the United States and Protector of the Rights of Same . ' ' ( The House of Representatives , whose doors had been opened to the public from its very first day , rejected the Senate ' s proposal with much derision . ' ' President of the United States ' ' would be quite sufficient , the House replied ) // One newspaper editor gleefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' ' The PEERS of America disdain to be seen by vulgar eyes : the music of their voices is harmony only for themselves , and must not vibrate in the ravished ears of an ungraceful and uncourtly multitude . . . The Senate usurp the secret privileges of the House of Lords. ' ' // Editorialists in all parts of the country wrote similar articles , and they eventually took their toll . One supporter of an open chamber urged senators to put the lie to such anti-monarchical hysteria . ' ' Let us show the people that the only aristocracy dwelling in this chamber is an aristocracy of information and abilities. ' ' // Another editor also played upon the vanities of senators . The editor of the Gazette of the US pointed out that House members were receiving the lion ' s share of publicity . ' ' It matters little to the public who presides in the Senate : They do not choose to let the public know any thing about the reasons of their political conduct ; the public may therefore trouble themselves little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy and try to get rid of them as soon as possible ; it is but little good ever they did , and but little good they can do , but they may do much evil ; there are however valuable characters shut up in the Divan . We sincerely wish them released. ' ' // On Feb. 20 , 1794 , the Senate voted 19-8 to open their proceedings to the public ' ' so soon as suitable galleries shall be provided. ' ' // For their part , the House of Representatives took it all in stride . Just as today , members of the ' ' lower house ' ' ( as representatives refer to themselves in mock self-deprecation ) took great joy in poking fun at the upper house . One member wrote this satirical view of the House proceedings when it was informed of the Senate vote : // ' ' Now Mr. Grove , be so good as to step upstairs and take a peep into the Senator chamber - That mighty conclave where it has been surmised Majestic Majack dwealt , where the illumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays of light from Heaven - where it has been suggested that Dangerous Vice sits as a minion on a throne , to make the hateful monster aristocracy lose all its proud and surley Features by dressing it in the garb of Davilla . The Deception however is discovered , and the Lords , the mighty Lords , are to be beheld as soon as accommodations can be prepared for the People . . . . To be short with you , the Doors of the Senate are to be opened next session - when some of these within will show their nakedness. . . . ' ' // A postscript : Television might consider what happened after the Senate doors swung open in 1794 . Newspaper editors took one look and decided their readers would be much more interested in proceedings of the House , the ' ' people ' s chamber ' ' where colorful figures were unlikely to let a little thing like gentlemenly behavior interfere with rhetorical hijinks . A televised Senate today might find its ratings suffering in comparison with the House. // But isn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might appeal to the best rather than the worst in senators ? Shallowness and crassness would be exposed to an unblinking eye . The more thoughtful and articulate might be motivated to new heights by a national audience - particularly a national audience seeing their speech whole rather than in 15-second snippets on the evening news . Surely in this complex and dangerous age we would do well to have a national forum for serious debate . Where better to have that forum than the body fashioned after the original Forum itself ? // // Tim Hackler is a Senate press secretary. // // // // //
