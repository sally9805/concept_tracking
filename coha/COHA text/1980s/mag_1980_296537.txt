" I OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES " by Neil Simon <P> Simon slays . His weapon is customarily murderous laughter . It is not quite like that this tune around . The laughs are ample yet muted and subordinated to a story in which a father and a daughter tug at each other 's heartstrings . In terms of standard Simon fare , this comedy is almost a poignant tearjerker . <P> The father , Herb ( Ron Leibman ) formerly a successful screenwriter , now has a seemingly terminal case of writer 's block . He is bantering away his life . Asked if he owns the West Hollywood Spanish stucco quarters he lives in , he answers , " Hell , no . The apartment belongs to six termites who lease it to four mice , and I rent it from them . " An off-and-on bedmate , Steffy ( Joyce Van Patten ) completes Herb 's agile mnage . <P> But not after Libby ( Dinah Manoff ) appears , with no advance notice . Libby , 19 , is the daughter Herb had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tomboy sort , wearing green-bordered knee socks and walking boots , Libby has trekked across the country to find out what her father is like .

This is where the play drifts into emotions of sitcom dimensions . Herb falls in love with Libby , not incestuously , but romantically and possessively . Libby 's mocking jests can not hide the scars of the unrestorable years . At one point , she pins Herb down , demanding to know why he divorced her mother . Herb rather lamely answers that the lady totally lacked a sense of humor . Logically , this is the weak point of the play . A man as perceptive as Herb would have spotted a congenital non-laugher during the months of his premarital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I Ought to Be in Pictures " with a mini-surprise . <P> Under Herbert Ross 's assured hand , the actors perform with impeccable honesty . Leibman moves from farcical jocularity to bleeding anguish . In a sketchy role , Van Patten displays warming femininity . When she is not biting into a juicy comic line , Manoff clings like a valorous terrier to her prey of hope .
