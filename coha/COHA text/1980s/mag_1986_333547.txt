A mark of Pope John Paul II 's charismatic style is his ability to illuminate human aspirations with a telling phrase or a symbolic gesture . For several hours last week , an unprecedented event put together under his auspices dramatized one of the greatest of all aspirations . At his invitation , leaders from the religions of the earth gathered under glowering skies in the tranquil medieval Italian town of Assisi and , with quiet dignity , uttered prayers for world peace . <P> The throng included rabbis wearing yarmulkes and Sikhs in turbans , Muslims praying on thick carpets and a Zoroastrian kindling a fire . In all , the 160 religious representatives came from a dozen faiths throughout the world . The scene was extraordinary in its visual diversity , the purple robe of Robert Runcie , the Archbishop of Canterbury , contrasting with the black of Greek Orthodox Archbishop Methodios . Buddhism 's Dalai Lama , traditionally regarded as a living deity , was in attendance , swathed in purple and yellow . Also there were Uruguayan Methodist Emilio Castro , chief executive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiapartheid activist Allan Boesak , president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches . Metropolitan Filaret traveled from the U.S.S.R. It was the " most beautiful gift to God , " observed Mother Teresa of Calcutta , the diminutive Nobel Peace Prize recipient . <P> The broad assemblage was set in Assisi in honor of St. Francis , the simple Umbrian friar whose life exemplifies humanity 's quest for peace . " If the world is going to continue , and men and women are to survive in it , " John Paul declared in English , " it can not do without prayer . This is the permanent lesson of Assisi . It is the lesson of St. Francis , who embodied an attractive ideal for us . " <P> Despite that ideal , the Pope 's audience was aware that Assisi symbolically went well beyond the ceremonial friendship accorded other faiths by any previous Pontiff . The assemblage included not only monotheists but believers in creeds once labeled " heathen " and " pagan " by a church that for centuries had preached unambiguously that there was no salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group also raised suspicions among some Christians that Assisi represented a heretical step toward syncretism , the amalgamation of various conflicting religions . For this reason , U.S. Fundamentalist Gadfly Carl McIntire branded the meeting the " greatest single abomination in church history , " and Catholic extremists in France passed out leaflets consigning John Paul to hell . <P> The Pope was well aware of such concerns . " Certainly we can not pray together , namely , to make a common prayer , " he explained , " but we can be present while others pray . " That , in fact , is what occurred . During the morning , each faith met for separate devotions in and around Assisi , and when all groups later gathered in the piazza , no interreligious rite was used ; individual delegates gave their own invocations .
