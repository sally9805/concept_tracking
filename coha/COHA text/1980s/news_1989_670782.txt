But in the Bronx , nothing seems to have changed much for Mr. Ruiz. // He still comes to work every day in his state office across the street from Yankee Stadium , with the large sign at the entrance that reads , " I. Ruiz , State Senator . " Or he roams his district , giving a hearty bear hug to a player at lunchtime bingo in a senior-citizen center , or imploring a mother to bring her youngsters to his office so that his staff could take their pictures , the better to locate them if they should wind up as missing children. // Mr. Ruiz , who is 45 years old , said that as far as he is concerned he is still a state senator , and he will keep on doing the work without pay because of " a moral obligation I have to my constituents. " // Attorney General Robert Abrams ordered Mr. Ruiz dropped from the state payroll after the Senator was convicted of filing a false loan application , but Mr. Abrams acknowledged that he can not kick Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not a member , an action that the Senators would be forced to consider only if Mr. Ruiz tries to vote . Governor Mario M. Cuomo can declare a special election only if the Senate declares the seat vacant , but Senate officials agree that they will probably let Mr. Ruiz exhaust all his appeals first , a process that could last until the next election , in 1990. // So it is Israel Ruiz who comes to the office of the senator for the 32d District . He was elected overwhelmingly last November to his eighth term , but he has not been paid since early February , when a Federal jury convicted him . The false loan application was for a supermarket Mr. Ruiz wanted to build on River Avenue in the South Bronx , near his office . His sentencing has been delayed while he presses his appeals , but he could face up to two years in jail and a $250 , 000 fine . <> <> ' I ' ll Be Back . You ' ll See. ' // Mr. Ruiz said it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his job , the work in Albany . His conviction will be overturned , he said . Or a judge will rule that he can keep his seat anyway , because the count on which he was convicted is not a state felony but a Federal one . Or he will simply run again in a special election , and win. // If Mr. Ruiz ' s conviction is upheld on appeal , he would not be allowed to return to his Senate seat , although he would be able to run in an election. // " I have too much respect for the chamber to ever go in there with a cloud over my head , " he said , referring to the Senate ' s ornate meeting place on the third floor of the state Capitol in Albany . " But this will lift and I ' ll be back . You ' ll see . " Professionally , Mr. Ruiz ' s life is very much in limbo . Financially , his life seems to be in disarray . After he was stripped of his salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could suspend $60-a-week child support payments until he received a steady paycheck again . The couple has two children , one of whom is beyond the legal age for receiving child support . Mr. Ruiz said his wife , a recruitment director for the New York City Board of Education earning $72 , 000 a year , just loaned him $10 , 000 from an account she keeps of money she made before they met in 1982. $40 , 000 in Debt But he owes $40 , 000 to his lawyers , and he could hardly turn to his campaign committee for help even if he wanted to . The committee , Friends of Israel Ruiz , has just $674. 16 in the bank , according to its latest filing with the state . It also has loans of $16 , 500 outstanding. // But the other day , with spring blowing in the Bronx , Mr. Ruiz seemed hardly perturbed . An aide - who remains on the state payroll - was driving Mr. Ruiz around in Mr. Ruiz ' s car , and he got out frequently to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t worry , " said Rosa Torres , who was out in the sunshine in the courtyard at 55 Woodycrest Avenue , a building Mr. Ruiz said he helped renovate by securing a government-backed mortgage . " Even if you ' re not going to be our senator , you ' ll still be our senator , " she said . Then she gave him a kiss . <> <> Showing His Scar // But as far as Mr. Ruiz is concerned , he certainly is the senator. // " One thing you should understand about Israel Ruiz , " Mr. Ruiz said , " is that the man is a fighter . " He turned up his chin and showed a small scar , which he said he received nine years ago when he was helping some local people rid an abandoned building of drug dealers . A man had jumped out of the shadows and had bitten him , Mr. Ruiz said . <> <> ' They Want to Neutralize Me ' // Mr. Ruiz blames his legal problems on his scrappiness ; he would never have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not challenged the Cuomo administration by raising allegations of corruption - from abuses by state prison guards to fraud in the awarding of state contracts . None of the allegations has resulted in an indictment , but Mr. Ruiz said that only proves that officials want to silence him. // " I ' m a thorn in their side , " Mr. Ruiz said . " They wanted to neutralize me. " // Fellow politicians in the Bronx described Mr. Ruiz as combative and unpredictable , and at various times he has feuded with practically all of them . But several said he deserved to exhaust his appeals before legislators decide whether he should vacate his seat . They also said that with or without a conviction he could almost certainly win his seat in a special election. // " Israel ' s a unique personality all right , " said the Bronx Borough President , Fernando Ferrer . " Politically , I guess he fancies himself a maverick . Personally , he ' s a nice enough guy . " Mr. Ferrer recalled that Mr. Ruiz ran a particularly venomous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by frequent charges that Mr. Ferrer was incompetent and a lackey from the days of Stanley Friedman , the now-jailed former Democratic leader in the Bronx. // " But then the day it was over and I won , " Mr. Ferrer said , " he came right over and said , ' Ha ha ha , Freddy , I didn ' t mean a thing of that stuff . You know I love you. ' " // Mr. Ferrer finished his story by saying of Mr. Ruiz , " How can you really be mad at someone like that ? " <> <> Seeking Reversal of Conviction // Among his court challenges , Mr. Ruiz has applied to Mr. Abrams to reinstate his Senate salary , and he is seeking to have his conviction overturned on the ground that he never actually filed the loan application that the jury said overstated his assets . The jury found him not guilty of perjury and of another false loan application charge. // Most of Mr. Ruiz ' s legal problems now stem from his relationship with the Alliance for Progress Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and runs job-training programs . In the last 12 years the state has given more than $600 , 000 to the alliance in so-called " member items " - special allocations made at the request of individual legislators - that were sponsored by Mr. Ruiz . The Alliance was the developer of the mall where Mr. Ruiz wanted to build his supermarket . The store was never built. // The other day , as Mr. Ruiz passed by a huge billboard that has stood for years on Jerome Avenue with a picture of him and his message to the people : " Participate Organize Give a Damn , " he said that his was a hard struggle but that he felt touched by the support his constituents had given him. // " People come up to me in the street . They give me medals . They give me candles , " he said . " One lady came to me and said she had been praying for me for four days straight . These people give me the strength to go on.
