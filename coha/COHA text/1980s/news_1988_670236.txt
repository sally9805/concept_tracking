DALLAS  --  The three sons of legendary oil baron H.L. Hunt will be forced to sell off major parts of their dwindling energy empire after tentatively agreeing to settle the last part of a bitter , 22-month legal battle with bank creditors . Hunt-held Placid Oil Co. could emerge from bankruptcy court proceedings as early as this summer if the settlement is finalized . " Our negotiating teams have reached a handshake deal , " said Henry W. Simon Jr . , Placid ' s bankruptcy attorney . But the agreement , which follows an earlier proposed settlement of litigation involving another Hunt entity , Penrod Drilling Co. , will leave Nelson Bunker , William Herbert and Lamar Hunt with mere remnants of their father ' s vast empire and only the hope of rebuilding it while repaying the debt , penalties and related expenses approaching $1. 5 billion piled up by Placid and Penrod . The $1. 5 billion is after an initial repayment of as much as $200 million by Placid , to be raised from the sale of major assets . On the block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lucrative Black Lake natural gas field in Louisiana , valued at an estimated $150 million to $180 million , and its interest in a downtown Dallas office tower , perhaps with a value of $50 million , according to Placid . The Hunts are expected to contribute other funds to pay off the banks but the sources of the money aren ' t yet clear . Other assets are likely to be sold as well , leaving Placid with its valuable producing properties in the Dutch North Sea , some domestic , on-shore properties and , at least , its three leases in the Gulf of Mexico ' s Green Canyon where Placid plans to continue a major exploration program . When the settlement is finalized , the Hunts will also be left with Penrod ' s drilling rigs , one of the world ' s largest fleets . The settlement differs in several ways from the previously reported Penrod agreement , which also hasn ' t been finalized . In that deal , the banks accepted less of an initial repayment  --  $50 million  --  in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , plus additional collateral . As collateral , Penrod will place in trust for the benefit of the banks about $200 million of real estate , which the Hunts could later repurchase . The Penrod settlement also stripped Herbert Hunt of any operational role ; the Placid settlement doesn ' t envision any management changes . The Hunts ' complex and contentious battle with its bank lenders broke out in June 1986 , after energy prices skidded and both Placid and Penrod began defaulting on $1. 5 billion of debt . Negotiations to restructure the debt failed and the Hunts filed suit in federal court here , accusing the banks of fraud , breach of contract and other alleged misdeeds . The banks , led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Citibank , both New York-based , and First RepublicBank of Dallas , immediately called the loans and began foreclosure proceedings . The Hunts responded by seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection for Placid and the William Herbert Hunt Trust Estate , while they worked out a plan to pay their debts . Later the trusts of Nelson Bunker and Lamar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy legal maneuvers against the banks , the Hunts have just about played out their hand in court . Both the Placid and Penrod settlements were hammered out just before Placid and the trusts , which own the companies , were to enter a final stage in separate bankruptcy court proceedings . Today , a federal bankruptcy judge here had scheduled arguments aimed at confirming a reorganization plan for Placid . The banks wanted to auction off the company , while the Hunts were fighting to maintain control and repay creditors over several years from operations . Lawyers for both sides said they will ask the court to delay those hearings while they draw up final settlement papers . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
