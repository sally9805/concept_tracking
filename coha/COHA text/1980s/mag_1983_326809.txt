Winners of the MacArthur awards can work on what they please <P> " It 's a miracle , " cried Randall Forsberg , and so it seemed to be . A disarmament proponent , Forsberg was reacting last week to the news that she had just revived a gift out of the blue : $204,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , which she can spend any way she likes . Forsberg was one of the framers of the plan to call for a nuclear arms freeze . Says she : " The award will permit me to be more productive in the various aspects of work for peace that I do . " <P> Now in its third year of creating dazzling surprises , the MacArthur fund named 13 other academics and professionals in its latest crop of fellows , including Economist Alice Rivlin , who is resigning as director of the Congressional Budget Office , and two distinguished Columbia University scholars : Sociologist Robert Merton and Soviet Specialist Seweryn Bialer . <P> The MacArthur awards are five-year stipends that range from $24,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winners , the larger their tax-free gifts ) . Fellows also get an additional $15,000 to bestow on their institutions . <P> For all this , the winners have to do nothing , absolutely nothing . The MacArthur giveaway is a talent search designed to encourage " discoveries or other significant contributions to society . " But there are no demands for progress reports , let alone a novel or scientific breakthrough . Candidates can not apply for grants , but are nominated , without their knowledge , by a secret committee of about 100 members . <P> The foundation began operations after the death in 1978 of Entrepreneur John D. MacArthur , sole stockholder of the Bankers Life and Casualty insurance company . With assets of $930 million , the foundation is the nation 's fourth largest ( after the Ford , Johnson and Kellogg funds ) . MacArthur left the disposition of his money up to the trustees , who hit upon the idea of making creative people free of financial worries . Says Harvard Psychiatrist Robert Coles , a winner in 1981 : " I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is over . " <P> As the newest crop of winners celebrated their good fortune last week , TIME sought out some of the 80 past fellows to learn how the prize money had changed their lives : <P> Composer Ralph Shapey : $288,000 in 1982 . " The big difference is psychological , " says Shapey , a professor of music at the University of Chicago . " You just are n't worried about money , you do n't think about money any more . " Shapey continues to compose in his unprepossessing apartment in Chicago 's Hyde Park , still does not own a car , and busies himself , as he did before receiving the award , with creating difficult music in a modern idiom that some critics have hailed as " expressive " and " romantic " despite its atonal complexity . Commercial publishers have issued only a handful of his compositions .
