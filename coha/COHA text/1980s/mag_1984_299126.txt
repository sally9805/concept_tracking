IN ANOTHER COUNTRY by Susan Kenney Viking ; 163 pages ; $13.95 <P> At the age of eleven , Sara is taken to a circus sideshow . There she is confronted with something inexplicable to a child and incomprehensible to her father : <P> a freak born without limbs . " Does she have no arms and legs really ? " the girl asks . The reply is reassuring and false : " It 's all done with mirrors . " <P> The words might be inscribed on the family 's coat of arms . For Sara 's par ents , tragedy in any form is something stage-managed and therefore bogus . But as Susan Kenney , 43 , indicates in her terse and precisely felt novel , even self-deceit , the most durable fiction of all , must have an end . Sara takes some 25 years to learn that sorrows can not all be explained away , and that in a life truly lived , grief and loss accumulate like possessions . <P> The lessons are painfully acquired . <P> Sara 's father dies soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into insanity . Sara marries happily , but the years are blighted by her husband 's long bout against cancer . Even her children 's beloved dog perishes . The catalogue of miseries seems to cry out for commercial spots and a station break : the stuff of noonday soap opera . But Kenney , a professor of creative writing at Colby College in Maine , knows two essential truths about melodrama : first that it is most powerful when combined with irony and understatement ; and second that it is a salient feature of modern life . Nothing in these six connected stories seems overdrawn or out of place . The metaphors of cold , echoing corridors , of looking glasses and toys have a lightness about them , but for the most part , Kenney is content to let the feelings ride on the facts . <P> Sara 's demented mother is observed " knitting , with a serene , satisfied look on her face , as though she 's finally got everything figured out and there 's nothing to run and hide from any more . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our only child , was one of us , never seeming to take in the fact that he was much the furriest and generally though not always ate and slept on the floor . " Her husband 's surgeon is described as " Big Bird wrapped in green Kleenex , peering and blinking everywhere except at me , which I do not interpret as a good sign . " She watches the machine at her husband 's bedside : " Digital numbers flash-two-twenty . Is that possible ? A pulse rate of two-twenty ? . . . Slow down , I mutter to the machine , to the frenzied fist inside his chest , willing the tinsel line to unfur itself a little . " <P> Ultimately Sara decides that " this is what I 've learned about the dead : It is not always their absence that haunts us . " The presence of the vanished dog , of the hospitalized husband , of the long-gone father is conveyed in odd , occasional glimpses and echoes that bring back the absent and the lost . It is an observation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to regard the world , and by a writer who has learned how to record it . <P> - By Stefan Kanfer
