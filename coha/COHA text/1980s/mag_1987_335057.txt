Mammoth billboard images of the kind that frequently adorn Manhattan 's Times Square have been a frustrating market niche for the $1.3 billion outdoor advertising industry . The huge , hand-painted icons often take a month to produce , sometimes depict faces inaccurately , and can be awkward to move . But now two California manufacturers have shown that turning out big pictures can be child 's play . Los Angeles-based Metromedia Technologies uses computers to convert photos or other artwork into billboards up to 17 ft. by 54 ft. within just six hours . Another company , Torrance-based Computer Image Systems , is creating a 41-ft. portrait of Liza Minnelli that will rise this week over New York 's Palace Theater.
