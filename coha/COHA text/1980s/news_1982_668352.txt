By Phyllis Iva Meserlian When Palm Sunday coincides with Passover , Jerusalem is indeed the Holy City . Queen of Judaism , she puts on her most splendid garments for Christian Holy Week as well . And in the silence that falls so expectantly on the eve of great feast days , one hears echos of the past . Timeless and still , the stones of the city wall seem to whisper tales of other times . Above the parapets , topping the ornamental Damascus Gate , hundreds of Arab children sit and cling , stationing themslves for the spectacle to come - the Procession of the Palms . Twice I have participated ( once in the rain ) and on other occasions , like these dedicated spectators , although not from such a lofty perch , I have watched this splendid pageantry , winding down from the Mount of Olives into the valley , then ascending toward St. Stephen ' s ( the Lion ' s ) Gate . Each year the procession , led by Franciscans , masses at the little chapel at Bethphage , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jericho lays in a generous supply of palms against this day - not the decorous " civilized " versions we know in our churches , but huge , sprawling branches , 10 and 12 feet in length , with fronds sometimes a foot across , deep green and lustrous . They are fitting companions for pilgrims on this magnificent journey , to be borne and waved in joyous triumph . Picture the cries of " Hosanna to the Son of David " and the ancient Hebrew benediction , even as it was shouted to Jesus during the original Palm Sunday : " Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . " The chapel itself is small and unassuming , with a lovely fresco of Jesus riding a white donkey while people strew palms and blossoms in his pathway , picturing the event as told in the Bible . Sheets of paper are distributed to all , with words and basic melodies for the chants and hymns to be sung along the way . Everyone is welcome . Sects covering the entire spectrum of Christianity participate and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marchers form an orderly line of procession and begin the journey . Along the road , people watch and wave from housetops , windows , roadsides . Down in the valley , over the Brook Kidron , and up the steep slope to St. Stephen ' s Gate , the walk continues its winding course . From time to time , hymns and choruses are chanted and sung . Before the procession reaches the city walls , cordons of Boy Scouts from various churches link crossed arms to hold back the huge crowds , surging out of the Old City to watch . Once inside , the procession comes to its final resting place in the courtyard of St. Anne ' s - a Crusader church , built by French knights , as evidenced by the fleur de lis carved on its pillars . This is the end of the journey , where the Latin patriarch appears on the balcony of the courtyard to the pilgrims , their palm branches raised high , awaiting his blessing . A charming custom , particularly popular with Arab children , is the Palm Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loveliest of all traditional decorations . Arabs weave palm fronds into individual basket cups - five or six on one central stalk of palm branch , five or six feet in length - and fill each cup with a different floral bouquet - iris , lilies , daffodils and carnations bloom in cascading magnificence . Something lingers in the heart after Jerusalem ' s celebration of Palm Sunday . The majestic splendor of the re-enactment touches all who witness it . Christians come from around the world to share this special occasion , yet Jerusalem itself lends it a special flavor - the color of a people ' s personality , expressed in acts of love and grace . The tempo of Holy Week begins with a joyus note that swells to a climax on Palm Sunday . What follows is a hush and air of expectancy , building up to the emotional crescendo of Good Friday . In the Christian Quarter of the Old City , scarlet eggs are baked in the center of round , flat , braided Easter bread . Each crimson egg is set like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stacked for customers in the open street throughout the week . Squares of cakes made with figs and dates are baked with raised prints of Christian symbols on their crests . All is in readiness for the high tide of the Christian year . It is only rarely that Holy Week for the Eastern Orthodox churches and the western churches coincide , since the Eastern churches follow the Hebrew calendar . Tenebrae is sung on Wednesday , and all candles extinguished in many churches , in preparation for the most solemn days of the Christian church . The Eastern Orthodox communities , especially the Armenian church , have elaborate ceremonis of footwashing , as well as Roman Catholic services , on Maundy Thursday . This day , commemorating the Last Supper , is a very solemn one , and the symbolic washing of the feet , performed by the highest church dignitaries on the poor and lowly , emulates Christ ' s humility in bathing the feet of his disciples . On the evening of Holy Thursday , a particularly memorable service is conducted in the Jesus Tower of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and conception , with round domes and arches , flanked by surrounding cloisters . The tower contains three tiny , jewel-like chapels , each one used for part of the service . It begins in the lower part of the tower . This chapel is lighted by oil lamps ( the oil is often pressed from olives in the Garden of Gethsemane , visible from the tower ) and beautified by wood carvings which illustrate the Book of Genesis and symbolize Judaism as the mother religion - the taproot of Christianity . After the opening portion of the service , the congregation climbs winding stairs to the middle of the tower where , in the second chapel , The Upper Room ( so named after the place where Jesus ' disciples gathered in the Gospel accounts ) , communion is given . Ascending the spiral staircase to the very top , silent meditation is observed in the Room of Silence - tiniest of all three chapels , with barely enough room for two or three people , kneeling in silent prayer . Bendiction is given on the observation platform outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the Old City and the Mount of Olives , where Jesus prayed so long ago , and looking toward Mount Zion itself , where Jesus shared the Last Supper with his disciples at the Jewish Passover - the example and prototype of all communion services . This service , fittingly , is ecumenical , with clergymen of many faiths conducting different parts of the worship . On Good Friday , people begin to gather early in the day for the solemn walk in the Via Dolorosa ( the Way of Sadness ) in the Old City , following the steps of Jesus on the Way of the Cross . On this one day of the year , many beautiful commemorative chapels along the route at each Station of the Cross , ordinarily closed , are open to all . On this day alone I was able to enter the beautiful and remote Russian Church , outside the Old City , high on the crest of the Mount of Olives . The view itself was an invitation to paradise . I could see , stretching away to the horizon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blue sky of a perfect day . The church itself was nearly a quarter of a mile from the entrance , and the wide path leading to it was bordered , on either side , by shoulder- high purple iris . The bell tower , free standing , was set apart , launching itself toward heaven . When I reached the church , I was stunned by the interior . It was decorated lavishly with pure gold . This church was the gift of Nicholas II , last czar of all the and Russias , and it was handsomely appointed . The doors to the sanctuary and most of the altar were pure , beaten gold . Jewels and icons were everywhere , candles and incense filled the air , and music , sung and chanted by the convent sisters , was celestial . Although the nuns were robed in black , the postulants ( some of whom seemed so young and small they appeared childlike ) wore brown robes , with pointed hoods . On another Good Friday , I attended a Greek chapel near the summit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted outdoors , and a procession of dignitaries from the Greek Orthodox community , complete with priests , acolytes , vestments , incense , and altarpieces , wound its way up to this tiny chapel . After the service of ritual , music and blessing , one of the priests , realizing that I was not of their community , but that I was a Christian , joining in their worship , smiled and spoke to me in English , inviting me to come forward for a blessing . This I gladly did , and was interested in the form it took . The priest took green plants , dipped in holy water , and blessed them , using them to make the sign of the cross over those who approached for a blessing . By noon , on Good Friday , the Old City overflows . Thousands of pilgrims of every description throng the Via Dolorosa . Processions begin at the First Station of the Cross - a Roman-paved courtyard which was once Pilate ' s place of judgment . The religious of many groups lead various processions , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind them follow pilgrims of all denominations and at each station of the cross halts are made for prayers . As they wind their way through the narrow streets and covered arches , hymns are chanted and sung . The end of the journey is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , a place hallowed and partially owned by three branches of Christendom - the Roman Catholic , Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches . Their tradition holds that the site of this church encompasses both the crucifixion on Calvary and the Resurrection . It is a very large and rambling building , and the case that is made takes into account that the Bible says the way of the cross went outside the walls of the Old City through the Gate of Judgment . The law required that no executions take place within the Holy City itself . However , since the walls of the Old City have changed through the centuries , the Gate of Judgment , still recognizable inside the Old City , was the outer perimeter of the Old City at that time , hence the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterion , as it was outside the city walls at the time of Jesus . Another case is made , by some Protestant groups , that the Garden Tomb , outside the present walls of the Old City , at a short distance from the Holy Sepulchre , was the site of the Ressurection . General Gordon , the British general so famous for his martyrdom at Khartoum , and a devoted student of the Bible , made a convincing case for the Garden Tomb . Its advantage , for Christian pilgrims , is that it looks more like what one expects , after reading the accounts in the Bible , in that it is a burial cave , with the stone which sealed the tomb in view . Furthermore , it is situated in a large open space , with gardens and flowers , ideal for outdoor worship services - and especially for Easter sunrise . The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is very old and revered , and it has very beautiful altars at its sites of Calvary and the Resurrection . It has many chapels and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crypt , called the Finding of the Cross . This is owned by the Armenian Church , and commemorates the finding of the True Cross by Helena , mother of Constantine , emperor of the Byzantine Empire . Many churches also observe the traditional three hour service between noon and three in the afternoon . On the evening of Good Friday , a very ornate and solemn procession takes place . This is carried out by the Russian Church and is called the Burial of Christ . A large gold casket , encrusted with jewels , is borne through the streets , symbolizing the burial of Jesus after the crucifixion . In preparation for Easter , as one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , one comes to the Stone of the Anointing . This is washed with rose water and anointed with holy oil , to honor the place where tradition says Christ ' s body was prepared for burial . Very early on Saturday , the Roman Catholic service of the Holy Fire ( Greek Rite ) is held . Lights at the traditional site of Jesus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the service is adorned with rich vestments and an angelic boys ' choir . In spiritual preparation for Easter , pilgrims visit the many chapels of the church , ranged around the main sanctuary - some dim with age , others splendid in their appointments and paintings . The chapel of St. Helena ( Armenian ) , formerly the Basilica of Constantine , in the lower recesses , is perhaps the very heart of the church . It was here , amid the remains of an ancient abandoned cistern , that St. Helena is said to have found the Cross . Perhaps the most moving and beautiful of the Holy Fire services was the Eastern Orthodox . This is always full to overflowing . The basilica itself has some very high balconies , which afford very choice spots to view the service . Inside the main church itself , there is a free-standing enclosed , box-like room , ornately carved in wood , called the tomb of Christ . Within this tiny chamber , large enough for only two or three to enter via a narrow passageway , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ ' s Resurrection . Ordinarily , pilgrims enter and pass through at will . During this time at Holy Week , only the priest conducting the service is inside , and at a given moment , the light for the Christian year is symbolically rekindled . Easter morning , Jerusalem shines with the beauty of worship . There are many ways to celebrate this beautiful day in Jerusalem . A Sunrise Service for me marks the most meaningful . High on a hillside outside the Old City , facing Mount Zion , stands the beautiful stone ediface of St. Andrews . This lovely church was built as a memorial to Scottish soldiers who fell in the Battle for Jerusalem in 1917 , when General Allenby conquered it from the Turks during World War I. Ten years later , General Allenby returned to lay the cornerstone of St. Andrew ' s . On my solitary walk , early on Easter morning , enroute to the Sunrise Service at St. Andrew ' s , I met a young Arab boy with the face of an angel and a huge red rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also saw a meteor burning brightly in the eastern , pre-dawn sky , its long tail a glow of orange light . Just as I crested the hill , streaks of light appeared in the distance , over the mountain of Moab ( the land of Ruth ) and pink fingers of dawn broadened and filled the sky . The crenellated walls of the Old City were etched in light . The service , again , was an ecumenical one . There were Catholic Sisters in snowy linen and wide-winged headpieces , Quaker ladies , and all shades in between . Another girl and I shared the honor of pulling the bell rope . When my feet touched the floor , I soared up eight or ten feet , and vice versa . After a few good tugs , we established a steady rhythm . We sang joyful Alleluias and heard the message of Easter ( sometimes , at this service , it was delivered in Hebrew , and then translated , sentence by sentence , into English ) . At the close of worship , fresh baked , buttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , to tempt our appetite and take the chill off the early morning air with a feeling of fellowship and unity . A true story of this church always moves me , especially at Easter . Robert Bruce , the great Scottish king who lived in medieval times , always wanted to visit Jerusalem , but never accomplished this in his lifetime . With his dying breath , he requested that his heart be buried in Jerusalem . The convoy entrusted with this mission , bearing his heart in a small casket , was waylaid by brigands in Spain , and his wish was never fulfilled . The heart was recovered and returned to Scotland for burial in an abbey . This legend is written on the altar of this beautiful church , and something of Robert Bruce ' s spirit pervades the pensive and serene setting , overlooking Jerusalem , built by the Scottish people , acknowledging his love for the Holy City . Following this early ( 5 a.m. ) service , an invitation was extended ( and accepted by several hundred ) for Easter breakfast , supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food came from all corners of the Holy Land - bananas from Jericho , eggs from Nazareth , and oranges , a gift from Jaffa , bread from Jerusalem - all contributing a love gift to celebrate this special day of gladness . Eggs were painstakingly colored and designed in advance , hidden for the benefit of the children . A list of names for all children present was made up , and each child had an egg intended especially for him or her , with individual names marked on each egg . A second service held later ( 7 a.m. ) at the Garden Tomb draws many thousands of people and internationally known speakers . The traditional church services of all churches take place on Easter morning , and the bells of Jerusalem and its hundreds of churches fill the air . My own particular favorite was the Anglican cathedral of St. George . " Put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , " echo the Psalms . At Eastertide , Jerusalem ( always a fascinating city , full of contrasts and many moods ) is dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palm Sunday , the tempo changes to the solemnity of the Good Friday Procession on the Via Dolorosa , and again the emotional pendulum swings back to the joyous mood of Easter itself . Holy Week in the Old City is a marvel of faith and tradition . The richness and diversity of many expressions of Christianity unflod in a colorful tapestry , reaching their zenith in manifestations of love and devotion . Above all , one can communicate much of its beauty and fascination , but Eastertide in Jerusalem is an experience to be treasured , never to be forgotten .
