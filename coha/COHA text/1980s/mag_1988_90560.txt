When I read the story on Tommy Chaikin and the steroid nightmare he endured while he was a football player at my alma mater , the University of South Carolina ( Oct. 24 ) , I was reminded of my first encounter with anabolic steroids . It was in 1974 . After my freshman season I wanted to get stronger and was frustrated that I could n't gain weight on my own . I began taking an anabolic steroid , Dianabol , and gained 20 pounds in 30 days and increased my bench press by 70 pounds . // I never took steroids again while I was in college , but I used them often in my nine years as an offensive guard in the NFL . In a story in this magazine three years ago I talked about my taking of steroids and their widespread use in the NFL ( May 13 , 1985 ) . At that time the league 's commissioner , Pete Rozelle , and the director of the players ' union , Gene Upshaw , claimed that steroids were n't a significant problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dropped me . I still wonder if that article had something to do with my being cut and the subsequent refusal of any NFL team to touch me. // There is great controversy  --  and hyprocrisy  --  about steroid use in sports . In the NFL , management long turned its back on steroids , claiming ignorance of the subject . Now Rozelle says that about 6% of the players are on anabolic steroids and that the league is really concerned . Who is he kidding ? My educated guess is that close to 50% of the linemen use steroids , which right there would be about 15% of all players . And I have to laugh at NFL officials ' talking about the health risks , using that as a scare tactic , as if football is n't filled with health risks . // It is not the use of steroids that I object to , it 's the way that usage is dealt with . Why is it always the athlete who is chastised for using steroids when it is the system that compels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to blame the athlete , who does what he feels he has to do to survive in this era of chemically enhanced competition , than it is to do something constructive . What 's a nosetackle supposed to do when he knows his coach expects him to weigh 295 pounds and bench-press 600 pounds ? Those numbers are not attainable by most men without the help of steroids . // It is time to get realistic about steroids . A decade ago the American College of Sports Medicine lost credibility with athletes when it stated that anabolic steroids do not enhance performance , a position it did n't reverse until recently . Athletes had found out that they did enhance performance . So why would they listen when the medical community cautioned about steroids ' deleterious side effects ? The health hazards associated with steroid use should be put into perspective . Others , including SI 's editors , disagree with me , but I question whether it is really unethical to give steroids to healthy people such as football players . What about painkillers , which players use even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet pills and birth control pills  --  all are widely accepted . How are they different from steroids ? // It would be great if sports were pure and steroids were n't a factor . It would be great also if we lived in a world without nuclear weapons . But can pro football be played today without steroids ? If you 're talking about maintaining present levels of aggression and strength , the answer is no . And it is naive to think that we can go back to the presteroid days . // By pretending that is possible , the NFL is treating the issue as no more than a p.r . problem . But it is actually getting itself into a p.r . dilemma . Publicity about steroid use has given the NFL a black eye . But it is apparent to me that the majority of sports fans are more interested in being entertained than in worrying about whether players are taking steroids . // The NFL recently announced that it will test all players for steroid use in preseason . But tests can be beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never get steroids out of sports . I believe we should recognize that players are going to take steroids , and we should establish procedures for monitoring that use for possible ill effects . Have the athletes watched by physicians trained in sports medicine , and administer everything from heart and liver tests to regular eye exams . The player would get his information from doctors instead of some guy on the street or at the gym . // I think athletes would welcome this change . At South Carolina I received my Dianabol on a prescription from a team doctor , and although that may sound sensational today , remember that steroids were less of an issue back then . At least the doctor who wrote that prescription took my blood pressure and checked me over before doing so .
