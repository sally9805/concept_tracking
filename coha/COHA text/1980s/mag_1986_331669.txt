" My first memory is of the brightness of light , light all around , " the painter wrote as she was approaching her 90s . She had been nine months old , sitting among white pillows outside her parents ' farmhouse in the wheat country near Sun Prairie , Wis. ; the Civil War had ended less than 25 years before , the Ford was not invented , and Picasso was six . That infant memory of brightness would irradiate her work for the best part of a century , leaving no doubt , when Georgia O'Keeffe died last week in Santa Fe at the age of 98 , that one of the great American lives had ended . <P> O'Keeffe 's career was unique in the annals of American art , for several combining reasons . The first , and most obvious , was its length . It embraced the whole history of modernism in America . Between 1916 , when a friend took a bundle of her drawings to Alfred Stieglitz at the 291 Gallery in New York City , and 1976 , when encroaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O'Keeffe remained either a vivid presence or , in her later years of isolation on her ranch in Abiquiu , N. Mex. , a formidable and revered absence . <P> The second was its tenacious originality . O'Keeffe was as thoroughly American as Joan Miro  --  whose clarity and depth of space her work sometimes distantly recalled  --  was Catalan ; her paintings remind those sated with cross-cultural quotation that major art is more apt to spring from deep allegiances to specific experience than from isms . She did not go to Europe until she was 65 . When she saw Mont Ste.-Victoire from Cezanne 's studio above Aix-en-Provence , she characteristically called it " a poor little mountain "  --  which it is , in a way , compared with the landscapes that surround her Ghost Ranch  --  and wondered why so many words had been piled on it . Before her 30th birthday , in small watercolors of epic space like Light Coming on the Plains , 1917 , she had become seraphically modernist without imitating cubism , fauvism or any other transatlantic recipes . <P> With O'Keeffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial air that clings to some early American modernism ( " Colonial Cubism , " in Stuart Davis ' mordant phrase ) . Her main stylistic affinities are less with other American or European painting than with photography : the work of Stieglitz , but especially of her friends Paul Strand and Edward Weston , obsessed with sharp focus , clear emblematic shapes of stone , bone and weathered root , the far telescoped into the near . Her America was a more stripped , fundamental and varied place than anything one can find in " regional " painting of the ' 30s . She made indelible images of the city , such as her views of and from the Shelton Hotel in New York City in the ' 20s , which convey the hard-edged , Promethean power of Manhattan . O'Keeffe spent part of every year in New York City until 1949 , but the landscape she made most completely her own , through more than 50 years of scrutiny and reverie , was that of New Mexico . She went there for the first time in 1929 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towering cloud architecture , the wrinkled hills " like a mile of elephants , " as she once put it , and the reduction of all organic form to sweeping , compressed epitomes lend her paintings something of the grandeur of 19th century panoramic landscapes .
