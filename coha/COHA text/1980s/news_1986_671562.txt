The tensions , which some compare to the friction between fundamentalists and liberals in Christianity , stem from a growing dispute among Orthodox , Conservative and Reform Jews over the validity of each group ' s standards for marriage , divorce and conversion . The standards are basic to a person ' s identity as a Jew. // " The extremism that manifests itself on both sides threatens to isolate Jew from Jew and to rend the fabric of Jewish peoplehood so that we will no longer be one people , " Rabbi Haskel Lookstein declared in his inaugural address in December as president of the New York Board of Rabbis . <> <> Uncommon Bitterness // The dispute , which intensified after a 1983 Reform decision to change the standards for Jewish identity , has become a persistent topic for synagogue and institutional debates , with one recent forum at the 92d Street Y bearing the title " The Internal War of the Jews . " It is difficult to pick up a copy of a Jewish newspaper or intellectual periodical these days without seeing one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been marked by an uncommon bitterness. // The Union of Orthodox Rabbis , one of several Orthodox rabbinic associations , placed an advertisement in a Jewish weekly warning Jews that hearing the shofar , or ram ' s horn , in a Conservative or Reform synagogue would not fulfill the obligations of the High Holy Days. // At the same time , several Orthodox leaders said they were deeply offended by a speech by Rabbi Alexander Schindler , president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations , the central Reform body , in which he said that one generation after Auschwitz , " Orthodox zealots " were establishing " their own kind of selecting process " to separate Jew from Jew . <> <> Major Schism Feared // Those who take the most alarmed views of the strife , such as Rabbi Irving Greenberg , who is Orthodox , predict it could in a generation lead to a schism where a sizable number of Orthodox Jews will not accept a sizable number of Reform and even some Conservative Jews as Jewish. // Such leaders predict that Orthodox and even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or daughter to marry a less traditional Jew . Children of less traditional families seeking admission into day schools and camps might also have their lineage investigated. // Others such as Malcolm Hoenlein , executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York , fear that the discord might erode the unity essential to strong support for Israel . Some say it may cause donors to reduce their gifts to Israel . <> <> Basic Differences // Even the seriousness of the crisis is a subject of debate . Many leaders believe the dispute is the most wrenching in generations . Others say the tensions are a more heated version of the healthy disputation that has always characterized Jewish life. // " The cries of the alarmists are exaggerated , " said Rabbi Wolfe Kelman , executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly , a Conservative group . " Every Jew in the world reacted the same when they saw Anatoly Shcharansky freed . Nobody asked was his grandmother Jewish or did she have a Jewish divorce . If they had asked , they would have been lynched. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the three branches of Judaism and divisions within each branch between liberal and traditional wings. // Orthodox Jews hold that the commandments of the Torah , and the hundreds of other laws that flow out of it , were given to Jews by God at Mount Sinai and are to be scrupulously followed for all time . The Conservative movement , which arose in the United States in the late 1800 ' s , believes the laws can change to serve modern needs , while the Reform movement , which began in Germany around the late 1700 ' s , believes the laws serve only as a guide. // According to the sociologist Egon Mayer , surveys show that about 10 percent of America ' s 5. 5 million Jews are Orthodox , 32 percent are Conservative , 23 percent are Reform and about 35 percent identify themselves as " just Jewish. " // Yet even those who take the most optimistic view agree that underlying strains between the three branches have been heightened by several developments in recent years . <> <> Debate on Lineage // In their 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intermarriages where either the father or the mother was Jewish . Until then , all branches of Judaism held to the standard that Jewish identity derived from one ' s mother. // Orthodox and Conservative leaders had always sharply disapproved of the Reform movement ' s liberal attitudes on such matters as Sabbath observance and dietary laws , but they had always accepted all Reform Jews as Jews . The so-called patrilineal descent decision meant that Reform Jews whose fathers were Jewish but whose mothers were not would not be accepted as Jews by Orthodox and Conservative adherents. // A second strain involving divorce and remarriage has been an issue for generations , but has been aggravated by the high incidence of divorce in recent years. // Orthodox and Conservative Jews believe that a marriage can only be ended by a get , a document approved by a rabbinic court . If a woman divorces without a get and remarries , any children from the second marriage are regarded as illegitimate. // The increase in Jewish intermarriage has also meant an increase in conversions , which has worsened another long-simmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they perform are not accepted by most Orthodox rabbis . Moreover , they are deeply offended by repeated efforts by Orthodox religious groups in Israel to amend the so-called Law of Return so that only those converted by Orthodox rabbis would automatically qualify for Israeli citizenship . <> <> A New Sense of Confidence // While many of these problems have been simmering for generations , the grievances have become more public because Orthodox Jews are feeling an unaccustomed confidence. // Increasingly affluent and well-educated , they have gained positions of prominence in business and politics , have become thoroughly familiar with the levers of power in American life and in secular Jewish organizations and are no longer afraid to speak their minds. // At the same time , said William Helmreich , chairman of the sociology department of City College , Conservative and Reform Jews have become more aggressive in pressing for a larger role in Israel , whose religious affairs are dominated by the Orthodox rabbinate . " Their congregants take trips to Israel and work on kibbutzim and they have woken up to the fact that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. // Perhaps the most ominous predictions come from Rabbi Greenberg , who is in the liberal wing of Orthodoxy and who is president of the Center of Learning and Leadership , a group that works for Jewish harmony . He predicts that by the year 2000 there will be more than 300 , 000 converts and 220 , 000 children of patrilineal descent , all of whom might not be recognized as Jews by the Orthodox . An additional 200 , 000 people , he says , will be children of women who had remarried without getting a rabbinical divorce . <> <> Only 20% Attend Synagogue // " By the turn of the century , there will be between three-quarters of a million and a million people whose Jewishness is contested or whose marriageability is denied by a large group of other Jews , " he said . With almost 20 percent of American Jews possessing ambiguous status , he said , " you have a situation ripe for schism. " // Mr. Mayer thinks such prophecies are overstated .

About half of all Jews are not affiliated with a synagogue and only about 20 percent attend synagogue regularly. // There are many who suggest the tensions are a healthy sign , testifying to a growing sense of security about Israel and lessened fears about anti-Semitism in America . " There ' s no common threat , so all the stuff swept under the rug is exposed , " said Rabbi David Novak , leader of a traditionalist wing of Conservative Judaism . <> <> ' We Can ' t Go Halfway ' // Many Jewish leaders predict that the sides in the dispute will simply have to live with the differences , avoiding areas that are theologically sensitive and cooperating in others. // Some of the problems may also be amenable to solution , Rabbi Kelman pointed out . A child of patrilineal descent who wants to be welcomed into the Orthodox or Conservative communities can undergo a conversion , he said . With children of improperly divorced women , rabbis have sometimes found grounds to annul the first marriage so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing of Orthodoxy pleads that it can not compromise on religious law , and that it will not be able to accommodate a questionable Jewish identity . " We can ' t go halfway , " said Rabbi Nosson Scherman , general editor of Mesorah Publications . " I believe Torah is God-given and I can ' t compromise on that. " // His Reform friends , he said , understand that while they can eat at his house , he can not eat at theirs because they do not observe dietary laws . Yet , even such social accommodations may be endangered by the dispute over the more fundamental questions of identity , he said. // " What happens if I can ' t recognize their grandchildren as Jewish ? " he said . " They ' re very tolerant and understanding , but what happens when push comes to shove . I ' m sure it would cause some ill will. " //
