The name won ' t mean anything to the vast majority of you , but Ruth Lyons died the other day . She was 81 . I mention this because of the recent flurry of publicity about something called " Trash Television , " also referred to as " Tabloid Television . " Suddenly networks and syndicators are finding that if they appeal to the lowest common denominator in their viewing audiences , they will get big ratings . Nothing is too abhorrent or disgusting to feature on a talk show . The more repugnant the subject , the bigger the audience . Ruth Lyons was the host of a talk show once . In fact , she was the host of one of the first television talk shows in America . Her program-it was called " The 50-50 Club " - was broadcast at midday five days a week on WLWT in Cincinnati . Ruth Lyons went on the air in 1949 and retired in 1967 . The reason I know about her is that she was astonishingly popular-so popular that the Crosley Broadcasting Co. arranged for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , in Columbus , Dayton and Indianapolis . " The 50-50 Club " was not tabloid television , and certainly it would never make it big nationally today . But my memories of watching Ruth Lyons on our local station in Columbus are positive and upbeat ones ; Ruth Lyons would never get her photograph on the cover of Newsweek with her nose broken and bloodied , but she had other qualities . Some of what happened on " The 50-50 Club " seems almost unbelievably corny now , but it wasn ' t offensive . The musicians in Ruth Lyons ' studio band , and other members of her on-camera cast , would often refer to her as " Mother . " The women in her studio audience-wearing white gloves-would sing " The Waving Song " as they would wave at the cameras ( " Let ' s wave to the folks who are watching . Say ' hello ' to the folks watching in . . . " ) . If you ' re smiling at that , you should also know that Ruth Lyons ' power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to advertise on her show ; when they did , and when Ruth mentioned the product , stores could not keep the items in stock . There was a three-year wait for tickets to " The 50-50 Club . " And when Ruth Lyons noticed , during a visit to Cincinnati ' s Children ' s Hospital , that there was a lack of toys for the young patients , she said so . Over the years the fund she started brought in more than $12 million . John Kiesewetter , TV columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer , remembers that when he was hospitalized as a 7th grader in Middletown , Ohio , the plastic model ships he received from Ruth Lyons ' toy fund were the bright spot of his convalescence . And five years ago , when Kiesewetter ' s own infant son was placed in an oxygen tent in a Cincinnati hospital , a toy from the same fund " brought the sparkle back to his eyes . " It may not have been tabloid television , but it worked . Ruth Lyons quickly spawned imitators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting " The 50-50 Club " on a feed from Cincinnati , we had a local version of Ruth Lyons-a woman named Sally Flowers who , if memory serves , bore an uncanny resemblance to Gladys Presley . And in Dayton , when the local Crosley Broadcasting station there decided to put its own talk show on the air , management chose a young host named Phil Donahue . " Yes , I just heard that she died , " Donahue said the other day . " Ruth Lyons was huge-she had unique power . She was kind of like Arthur Godfrey . She was in the big leagues-she was in Cincinnati and the three other Crosley cities-and I was just the local guy out in the boonies . " I told Donahue that I didn ' t want to put words in his mouth-but was it fair to say that if Ruth Lyons hadn ' t succeeded , there would never have been a " Donahue " show ? " Well , there was no way that she wasn ' t going to succeed , " Donahue said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Crosley Broadcasting with a commitment to local programming , and if there had not been a Ruth Lyons , I probably wouldn ' t be here . " It wasn ' t tabloid and it wasn ' t trash . So probably it wouldn ' t sell today . And yet , when the mayor of Cincinnati hosted a " Ruth Lyons Day " at a local auditorium in 1957 , 4 , 500 loyal fans were in attendance . That wasn ' t the startling thing , though . More than 100 , 000 other people requested tickets , and had to be turned away . Maybe-just maybe-there is a lesson in that for the men and women who run television today .
