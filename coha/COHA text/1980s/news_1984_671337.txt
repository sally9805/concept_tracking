Bank Street , whose unsuccessful bid was less costly than Harvard ' s and had the support of a technical advisory panel , has accused the National Institute of Education of violating Federal procurement rules by " arbitrarily " selecting Harvard. // " They overruled the advisory panel without providing good reasons , and they put us at a big disadvantage by giving cost information to Harvard but not to us , " said Robert C. Granger , vice president and dean of Bank Street. // Manuel J. Justiz , director of the National Institute of Education , the research arm of the Department of Education , made the decision . He defended it on the ground that Harvard ' s proposal contained a " broader vision of what a new center in this area should be . " The dispute has aroused considerable attention in educational research circles , in part because it comes as the Department of Education ' s procedures for awarding contracts to the 17 Federal educational research centers around the country are being scrutinized by Congress and the Reagan Administration. // The controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the House Intergovernmental Relations and Human Resources subcommittee , which oversees Department of Education activities . Bank Street is in his district. // Last week Mr. Weiss , citing " blatant violation of the education procurement regulations , " wrote to Charles A. Bowsher , the Comptroller General , requesting a formal investigation into the institute ' s practices for awarding contracts . " A process that is supposed to be based on educational grounds rather than political ones has been internally and externally politicized , " Mr. Weiss said in an interview. // The dispute revolves around the establishment of a School Technology Center to investigate the use of technology to improve instruction in mathematics and science in the elementary grades through high school . Congress authorized the creation of a New England-based center in December 1982 at the urging of Representative Silvio O. Conte , the Massachusetts Republican who is the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee. // Last June the National Institute of Education sent out a " request for proposal " to 600 universities . Three of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , which had been favored by Mr. Conte . The remaining three were scrutinized by a " peer review board , " half of them institute staff members and half external reviewers. // Five of the panel members recommended the Bank Street proposal . Four backed the Harvard Graduate School of Education , and one supported the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The collective evaluation of the three proposals put Bank Street in first place , M.I.T. second and Harvard third. // Victor Westbrook , the chief contracting officer at the institute who would normally make the decision , reportedly favored the Bank Street proposal . Mr. Justiz , however , exercised his authority to review the proposals and ruled for Harvard. // Bank Street appealed to the General Accounting Office , which can recommend the termination of contracts or the reopening of competition . Vincent B. Knox , the acounting office attorney , said a decision could come " in four to six weeks. " // <> <> Explanation Is Sought // In its appeal , Bank Street acknowledged that Mr. Justiz had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a more costly bid , but it argued that Federal procurement law required that an adequate explanation be given for doing so . " If they decide to go with the higher cost bidder , they have to justify the decision , " said Mr. Granger . " They didn ' t do any of this. " // Bank Street also accused the institute of violating the law in the negotiation process by informing Harvard and M.I.T. that their initial bids , $9. 2 million and $11 million respectively , were too high . Bank Street was not advised that its bid of $4. 5 million was below the $7. 2 million that institute staff members had estimated. // In written testimony to the accounting office , Mr. Justiz said Bank Street " did not have the full and broad range of expertise needed to comprehensively address the appropriate use of technology to improve mathematics and science education. " // <> <> Political Motivation Suggested // Several aspects of the award have led to speculation in educational research circles that political considerations might have played a part , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ware school system , in Mr. Conte ' s district in western Massachusetts , was added to the Harvard research plan. // In a letter responding to such allegations , Mr. Conte noted that he backed the University of Massachusetts , which is in his district . " If someone could explain to me how I can be accused of pressuring the result of a competition when my application did not even make the semifinals , I would appreciate it , " he said . " If anything , this speaks to the integrity of the competition. " // Officials at Harvard noted that Mr. Conte , a Republican , would be unlikely to pressure a Government agency to award a contract to Harvard , which is in the district of the Speaker of the House , Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , a Democrat. // Critics of the National Institute of Education assert that the Reagan Administration has tried to use the agency to promote conservative causes . However , Mr. Justiz , a professional researcher who took over at the institute a year ago , has generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson , president of the American Educational Research Association , conducted his own review of the matter . In a report to his membership last December , he stated , " I have tried to track down every rumor that came to my attention , and I have found no evidence that would warrant any other conclusion than that Director Justiz made a principled decision.
