Administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Shultz received the letter a few days ago and said a response was being prepared. // One high-ranking official said there were some " positive elements " in it , but he was unsure that Mr. Shultz would view it as going far enough to warrant Administration support for the $1. 5 billion , which is in addition to the $3 billion in military and economic aid already approved by the Administration for the 1986 fiscal year , which begins Oct. 1 . <> <> ' A Lot of Promises ' // " There are a lot of promises in the Peres letter , " an American official said , " and Shultz has made it clear that we are looking for actions instead of promises. " // Israeli and American officials said there had been a number of letters between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Peres on the economic issue since late last year . State Department officials said they could not cite any other instance in which the Secretary had been so deeply involved in discussions with a foreign leader on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional American aid. // This involvement is due to several factors , they said . One is Mr. Shultz ' s background as an economist and former budget director and Treasury Secretary in the Nixon Administration . Another is the heavy dependence of the Israelis on American military and economic aid , and the political interest in Congress on the size of that aid. // When it became clear last year that Israel , already the largest American aid recipient , would seek a huge increase over the 1985 fiscal year total of $2. 6 billion , Mr. Shultz told the Israelis that they had to take dramatic steps to reduce their inflation rate of about 1000 percent a year , and take other structural steps to change their economy . Otherwise , he said , the additional aid would just be wasted in paying off debts . Mr. Shultz leaves with President Reagan on Tuesday for the economic summit in Bonn , and the House of Representatives is due to take up the foreign aid authorization bill next week. // The House Foreign Affairs Committee , in drafting the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion sought by the Israelis , but Israel ' s supporters in Congress , aware of pressures to cut spending , would rather have the Administration endorse the extraordinarily high total figure of $4. 5 billion. // Mr. Shultz is due in Israel on May 9 at the start of a three-day trip that will include Egypt and Jordan , and he will presumably discuss the economic problems with the Israelis then . <> <> Pressure on Administration // These factors have put additional pressure on the Administration to come up with a recommendation about the additional aid soon , officials said. // The letter from Mr. Peres was in specific response to a series of confidential suggestions made to the Israelis by Herbert Stein , a former chairman of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers , who has been a personal adviser to Mr. Shultz on the Israeli economy , Israelis said . Today Mr. Stein declined to discuss his reaction to the Peres letter , pending conclusion of the State Department study. // Mr. Stein and Mr. Shultz have both been adamant in insisting that the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In opposing the House Foreign Affairs Committee ' s endorsement of the aid on April 2 , Mr. Stein said : " A decision to provide supplemental aid before the program has been established can only weaken the sense of urgency about developing the program . Initiation of the needed program would be deferred , possibly until some future crisis . " <> <> Israeli Budget Called Too High // Mr. Stein said that the Israeli Government budget was excessively high , and that even with military costs excluded , it was spending 50 percent of the gross national product , compared with 30 percent in the United States. // This large budget , he said , " can not be financed by taxes " and forces borrowing from the Bank of Israel , the central bank , which has not been independent of the Government and therefore raises funds by printing money . This had led to very high inflation. // The net effect , he said , is that " it has destroyed the vigor of the Israeli economy , which only a few years ago was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peres has responded to Mr. Stein ' s ideas " in a positive way " in his letter. // " The thrust of it is that Israel will adopt a policy guided by goals of restraining inflation , " the diplomat said . <> <> Limit on Inflation Promised // According to Israeli diplomats . Mr. Peres said in his letter that over the next six months , the Government would set a limit on inflation and if it was exceeded , additional measures would be taken. // The Israelis will also study the way the budget is being followed every three months and take steps to correct any overruns . One criticism of Mr. Stein is that the Israelis regularly overspend their budget. // To cope with the problems of " printing money , " Mr. Peres said the Government would submit to Parliament a law to grant independence to the central bank and prohibit the Government from ordering the bank to print new money. // But Mr. Peres was unable to meet all the conditions set by Mr. Stein , and there is still criticism here of the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that then treat the deposits as if they were in dollar denominations , thereby giving Israelis a hedge against devaluation of their currency. // Mr. Peres did not deal directly with this practice and said only that it would be studied in coming months. // In the letter , Mr. Peres stressed , Israelis said , that the $1. 5 billion in additional aid was needed now and should not have to wait until the changes were carried out. 25% of Total Aid in 1984 Mr. Shultz , in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last Sunday , said that between 1981 and 1984 , the United States gave almost $9. 5 billion in aid to Israel , and that in 1984 aid to Israel made up more than 25 percent of the total aid program. // " Yet , we must all understand that this aid can not really help unless Israel makes hard and far-reaching decisions for structural adjustment , " he said. // " Israel must pull itself out of its present economic trauma , " he said . " And the Israeli people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Israel will need support as it makes the needed adjustments , and here , the United States can and must help . But our help will be of little avail if Israel does not take the necessary steps to cut Government spending , improve productivity , open up its economy and strengthen the mechanisms of economic policy . Israel and its Government must take the hard decisions. " // To help the Israelis , the United States agreed to a Free Trade Agreement that was signed in Washington last Monday , making it easier for each country ' s exports to be sold in the other. //
