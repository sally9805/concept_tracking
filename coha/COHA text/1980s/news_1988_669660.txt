In both the American primaries and the Chilean plebiscite , public opinion surveys have been hotly debated . Yet these surveys cast very different light on the kinds of ' ' democracy ' ' each nation possesses. // // Surveys of varying quality are done in both countries , but the effect of poor polling is much more damaging for Chile . In the US , surveys are so numerous and varied that no one need pay much attention to polls with shoddy methodology and questionable results . But in Chile , where polls are fewer and more secret , they become the stuff of propaganda , disinformation , and manipulative campaigns . In America polls mirror the resilience of democratic norms ; in Chile such norms must struggle against the polls to be reborn. // One sign of President Pinochet ' s concern with public opinion is that he has always turned to professional pollsters to measure it . Skopus , a firm that does not publish its results , conducts regular polls for the government . Earlier this year , with an ad hoc research team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted an extremely large and well-funded survey of voters ' preferences nationwide ; it is a study considered crucial to establishing Pinochet ' s plebiscite strategy. // Yet critics also accuse Chilean authorities of manipulating opinion data for public consumption . A separate firm is generally believed , in Santiago ( and in the American Embassy there ) , to publish results in the press that make public opinion seem much more favorable to the government than it is . Many see the government as encouraging the fabrication of data to influence rather than measure opinion. // Despite such charges , and to its credit , the Pinochet administration has also allowed other polls to flourish this year , a practice that differs from the early years after the general took power in 1973 . During the 1970s , would-be pollsters had to gain prior approval for their questionnaires , register their interviewing with military commanders at the regional level , and submit their results first to the government . But in the ' 80s the old restrictions have given way . This year , in the climate of the plebiscite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results now set the stage for the political contest . FLACSO , the prestigious Latin American Faculty of Social Science , concluded its first nationwide poll on the plebiscite last month . It found the numbers of those tending to vote ' ' yes ' ' to Pinochet ' s staying on roughly equal to those who would vote ' ' no ' ' ; almost a third of the electorate still refused to make a choice . Those who want the plebiscite to take place are encouraged by these results . They fear that , if the President found himself losing badly , he would change the rules again. // Within the ' ' yes ' ' and ' ' no ' ' camps , Chilean voters tend to split sharply by region and age . Older voters and those in the countryside favor Pinochet ; younger voters and those in the larger cities oppose him. // It is on these battlegrounds that pollsters have turned into polemicists . Supporters of the government attack surveys taken only in the cities , claiming they overrepresent the opposition . Critics of Pinochet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweigh the older segment of the population . Ordinary citizens find it difficult to know which polls to trust ; many quote the polls they want to believe and criticize the polling process per se. // Polls have thus become a kind of political cannon fodder , a source of ridicule rather than enlightenment . On one level , they are like the data on economic growth , which Chileans interpret very differently . Pinochet ' s opponents note that Chilean growth was more rapid in the ' 60s than in the last 15 years ; they point to the huge foreign debt and to the uneven distribution of recent development benefits. // Pinochet ' s backers look at the other side of the economic coin : rapid increases in GNP that should be about 5 percent again this year , massive construction of offices and homes in Santiago , the successful reversal of widespread state ownership through privatization , high domestic savings and the inflow of significant foreign capital , and one of the few economies in the world now strong enough to pay the interest on the foreign debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Here the likeness between the polls and the economic statistics ceases . People agree on the numbers . The government provides all the data ; politicians argue simply about how to interpret them . In the polls , rival survey firms and opposing politicians claim outright fraud. // These charges throw into relief two very different ways in which public opinion surveys function in Latin America . When polls are secret , they can help autocrats stay in power , as with Pinochet . When pollsters are free to survey , to work for competing parties , to publish and debate the results in the media , then the polls become a central fiber of the democratic process. // That process is hard to reverse , at least in the long run . Before the early 1970s , Chile enjoyed one of the longest and most effective traditions of democratic institutions in the hemisphere . And in the last decade , democracy has also replaced military authoritarianism among Chile ' s neighbors - in Peru , Brazil , Argentina , and Uruguay. // Can Chile remain indefinitely separate from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful of a return to the economic chaos that many Chileans still vividly remember as characterizing the presidency of Salvador Allende before 1973 ? // The answer is probably not , although the time frame remains in question . In this year of the plebiscite , one measure of that transition toward democracy will be the Chilean public opinion polls - not only for what they say , but also for how openly or how manipulatively they are allowed to say it. // //
