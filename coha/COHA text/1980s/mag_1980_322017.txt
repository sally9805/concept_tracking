The casting call for Bob Hope 's NBC-TV special next week was for girls who considered themselves elevens-compared with Bo Derek 's ten , of course . Three hundred stunners showed up for six wiggle-on parts in the show , a lighthearted Charlie 's Angels take-off about undercover girls in the garment trade . Hope 's daughter Linda , the special 's producer , made the initial selections ; her father , in sport togs and golf cap , did the final choosing . " I went through 150 girls and three pacemakers , " chortled Bob , 76 . Observed Linda : " For once in his life , he did n't mind being late for his golf game . " <P> <P> Trust Barbara Walters to ferret out a secret . Interviewing Fred Astaire , Walters bluntly asked Hollywood 's soign cine-dancer whether he planned to marry Woman Jockey Robyn Smith , 35 . Said Fred , 80 : " She is a great girl . " Well , had he popped the question ? " Yes , sure . " Would they wed soon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference ? " I do n't even think about it . " Smith , once a jock for and good friend to Maryland Horseman Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt , 67 , met Widower Astaire eight years ago while she was riding the California tracks ; their feelings quickly became parimutual . Astaire wants her to keep on jockeying if they marry ; railbirds may not be so keen . Smith 's only other winner this season was a Santa Anita mount six weeks ago named Rock ' n Royalty . <P> <P> George Sand never made it . Neither did Colette nor Madame de Stael . For ever since the elite 40-member Acadmie Franaise was established by Cardinal Richelieu in 1634 to uphold France 's literary standards , it has barred its doors to women . But now the " Immortals " have voted to breach France 's macho line by admitting Novelist Marguerite Yourcenar , 76 , author of Hadrian 's Memoirs and acclaimed translator of Henry James and Virginia Woolf . Though Yourcenar holds U.S. as well as French citizenships and has lived in Maine for 30 years , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Philosopher Jean Guitton , 78 , grumbled that bringing a woman into the academy " is like putting a dove in the rabbit hutch . One inhabitant like that makes the place overpopulated . " After 45 years of work , the group 's current project , a definitive French dictionary , has reached the fs , which means that Yourcenar has arrived just in time to explain fminisme . <P> <P> There 's a reason why Lynn Swann is so deft when he dodges downfield as a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers . Swann 's way was honed in dance studios , where he spent 14 years learning moves . He displays his skill on Omnibus , the 1950s magazine-format show that ABC is reviving this spring . In one segment , with Hoofer Gene Kelly beating time , Swann joins Choreographer Twyla Tharp and Ballet Star Peter Martins in a Tharp dance about a wide receiver . Said Swann after his off-the-field patterns : " My thighs hurt . "                  @ @ @
