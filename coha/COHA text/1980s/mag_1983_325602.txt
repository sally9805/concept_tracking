Exploding spare-part prices <P> At a time when President Reagan is fighting with Congress over his record military budget , whistle blowers in the Pentagon are continuing to sound alarms about the wasteful way past funds have been spent . Last fall a leaked report , prepared by Air Force auditors at Oklahoma 's Tinker Air Force Base , showed astounding increases in the price of aircraft engine parts made by Pratt &; Whitney : a turbine air seal for an F-111 fighter-bomber , for example , soared from $16 to $3,033.82 in one year . These findings touched off a broader study by the Pentagon 's inspector general 's office . Last week a leak of the resulting draft concluded that Air Force and Navy purchasing practices encourage exorbitant price increases on aircraft engine spares . <P> The inspector general examined price increases from 1980 through 1982 for nearly 15,000 aircraft engine parts and discovered about 65% of the prices had risen by more than 50% ; 4,000 items had ballooned by more than 500% and some by more than 1,000% . A gear-and-pinion assembly supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of 1,628% . A spare part from Britain 's Rolls-Royce was marked up from $3.70 to $54.75 , an increase of 1,380% . Inflation over this period was 28.9% . <P> The report blames the price hikes not only on the suppliers but on Pentagon purchasing agents for failing to insist on greater competition among parts manufacturers , and for not reforming contracting procedures to prevent absurd markups . In practice , Pentagon agents tend to prefer " sole source " contracts with a major manufacturer , who will acquire the parts from subcontractors and take a profit as middleman . When bids on parts are sought , the Pentagon 's buyers often deem the competition " adequate " even if the only " bidders " are the prime contractor and one of its subcontractors , whose business often depends upon remaining on good terms with the larger company . Furthermore , the report contends , Pentagon buyers are reluctant to permit new sources of parts from breaking into the circle of approved suppliers . <P> Such practices have been condoned , the Pentagon report contends , in part because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and quantity of the purchases they make . " Cost is not a major consideration , " concluded the inspectors . <P> A similar admission came last week from John Melchner , director of the Pentagon 's Defense Audit Service , to a House subcommittee . He testified that Navy purchasing officers " are pushed to get parts as soon as possible , " even if it means bypassing the Pentagon 's inventory . For instance , the Navy paid the Sperry Corp . $110 for each diode used in an F/A-18 fighter-bomber flight simulator , even though the diodes were available from the Pentagon 's own spare-parts stockpile at 4 each . The apparent reason for this expensive shortcut : unwillingness to order through the cumbersome military bureaucracy . Declared Democratic Congressman Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts : " This is an abominable situation . "
