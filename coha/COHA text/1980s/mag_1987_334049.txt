Some 30 pages into Philip Roth 's new novel , a character named Henry Zuckerman comes up with a decidedly odd idea . The setting is Henry 's dental office in northern New Jersey ; the atmosphere shimmers with the sexual tension generated for weeks now by the presence of Wendy , Dr. Zuckerman 's new employee . " ' Look , ' he said , ' let 's pretend . You 're the assistant and I 'm the dentist . ' ' But I am the assistant , ' Wendy said . ' I know , ' he replied , ' and I 'm the dentist  --  but pretend anyway . ' " This fiction seems indistinguishable from the facts of the matter . But once the artifice begins , so does the fun . <P> Others can play make-believe , of course ; Roth has argued for years that everyone does so all the time . So let 's pretend . Philip , the younger son of Herman and Bess Roth , was born in Newark in 1933 . He . . . he was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying summer outings to the Jersey shore . He was a bright student , and after graduating from Weequahic High School in 1950 , he spent a year at the Newark extension of Rutgers University . Then , wanting to see something of the world outside his hometown , he transferred to Bucknell in central Pennsylvania , where he acted in college drama productions ; founded , wrote for and edited a literary magazine ; and graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in English . <P> Where next ? Well , say he took an M.A. at the University of Chicago and decided to go on for the Ph.D . He met and married Margaret Martinson , the mother of two children by a previous marriage . When his first attempts at short stories were routinely rejected , Roth gave up his literary aspirations and buckled down to his academic career . He earned his doctorate and went on to teaching positions at the University of Iowa and Princeton . The Roths live in suburban Philadelphia , where he is a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough Enough ? and Franz Kafka : The Sit-Down Comic . <P> It could have happened that way . In fact , a lot of it did . But this refraction of reality is not nearly as interesting as it might be . To punch it up a bit , suppose that Roth 's fiction was clamorously acclaimed ; that his first published volume , Goodbye , Columbus ( 1959 ) , won the National Book Award and made the author a name to be reckoned with at 27 . Implausible , true , but more dramatic than the other version . And what about that happily-ever-after marriage ? Maybe it lasted only a few years before plummeting into an acrimonious separation in 1963 that left Roth deep in debt , thanks to legal expenses , and sent him reeling into five years of psychoanalysis . Awful , but for the sake of the narrative not bad . Right about here a reversal of fortune would do nicely . So our hero wrote Portnoy 's Complaint ( 1969 ) , the novel that made him rich , famous and controversial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then . . . and then Roth fell in love with a movie star .
