In the midst of all the ' 87 madness  --  sold-out arena concerts , two No. 1 singles , a No. 1 album , a deluge of magazine covers  --  U2 knew they were adrift . It was n't simply that the velocity of their incredible success had cut them loose from their moorings . Superstardom beamed a sudden , harsh light : the Irish band had no strong musical foundation at all . There was a sudden shared awareness among them that their center could not hold because it had never been firmly fixed . <P> Bono , the band 's vocalist and lyric writer , had been fretting over this problem for some time . " The music of U2 is in space somewhere , " he told Bob Dylan . " There is no particular musical roots or heritage for us . In Ireland there is a tradition , but we 've never plugged into it . " Dylan , who has nurtured and torn up a few roots in his time , knew just what to say : " Well , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Rattle and Hum , the title of both U2 's brand-new album of the 1987 tour and the energetic performance documentary film released last week , is the sound of the band making contact : with music , with tradition , with their audience , with one another . The title comes from Bullet the Blue Sky , their rabble-rousing apocalypse about American muscle flexing in Central America ( " In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum . . . Outside is America " ) , but the substance of these various tour diaries is , in fact , an exploration . U2 did more than reach back . They immersed themselves in American musical culture , splashed and reveled about , and came away baptized . <P> The musical contents of the album and film vary slightly . The record contains three songs not in the movie , while the movie has eight performances not found on the album . LP and film make a good complement to each other , but it is on the record that the band stakes its strongest claim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot straight to the top of the album charts , accompanied by some grumpy reviews that fretted about a scope that went way too wide and a cohesion that remained elusive . Indeed , Rattle and Hum is careeningly ambitious , but what fixes its focus is the band 's passion to rediscover and remake themselves . With crystalline production supervised by Jimmy Iovine , U2 has never sounded better or bolder . Performances are mixed together with new , studio-recorded material into a record that is part mosaic and part road map of the group 's musical unconscious . <P> They perform with a Harlem gospel choir on a version of I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For that becomes a bit of casual exaltation ex rock cathedra . They cook up a new song for the great bluesman B.B. King , When Love Comes to Town , and kick out the jams together . They corral Dylan into playing Hammond organ on an extraordinary new tune , Hawkmoon 269 , and press him into harmony-singing and lyric-writing service on Love Rescue Me , a high point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual adviser . The Edge , the band 's wizard guitar player , contributes a lilting , spooky piece of folk inspiration , Van Diemen 's Land , and the whole group works out at Sun Studios in Memphis , where Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis cut some of their best sides . It is a deliberate pilgrimage , of course , but Angel of Harlem , one of the tunes recorded there , not only pays homage to the Sun tradition but also cops a good deal of its sweet , rowdy spirit .
