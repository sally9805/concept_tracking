txt ERROR , WHEN it enters a person 's life , of- ' ten comes not with a great flash of drama , but with a sickening apd insinuating slowness that does not become apparent until it is too late . The woman we are talking about today is named . Lhum ; for reasons that will soon become obvious , her last name is not being printed . She is married , 24 yearseld , has an infant child , and lives in suburban Bolingbrook . Linne 's husband is a truckdriver , who hauls loads of grocery products to the East Coast . Most weeks he is gone five or six days ; Linne usually seed him only on the weekends . She and her husband subscribe to a magazine called Overdrive ? a publication that is devoted to truckdriving and the truckers ' lifestyle . In the December , 1978 , letters-to-the editors column of Overdrive , Linne ' had a letter and a poem published . Her letter began , " I 'm a trucker 's wife and fierce . ly proud of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wives . " The poem was called " The Other Woman ; " it concerned a truckdriver 's almost romantic love for the highway . At the end of . the letter , she included her name and address . " I wanted people to write to me , so I could have , pen pals , " she explained the other day . " I 'm alone every night .... I do n't think that anyone other than a trucker 's wife can understand the feeling , and I wanted to communicate with them . " ' LINNE RECEIVED about 30 letters from truckers ' wives . She also received one from a man . The man said that he was a truckdriver in Pittsburgh , was married , and liked the idea of hayHis next letter had more questions : What was she wearing when she passed out ? How high had the heels on her shoes been when she passed out ? . . ' I 'll bet you 're really dynamite when you pass out ? really sexy . ing . a pen pal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . received , including his . After they had corresponded without incident for , several months , the man wrote a letter saying that he had enrolled in medical school part time , and was doing research on people passing out . lie asked Linne if she had ever passed out , and if so , if she would write to him about it . She did . His next letter had some more questions : What was she wearing when she passed out ? How high had the heels on her shoes been when she passed out ? Today Linne knows that she was probably " insane " for answering that letter . But she did . His next letter had .. more questions : Had she been in a car when she passed out ? Where would she like to be when she passed out ? That 's when she knew she had a sick person on . her hands . She kept reading : " I 'll bet your 're really dynamite when you pass out ? really sexy . " SHE STOPPED writing to the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the road , her telephone rang . It was the  --  truckdriver from Pittsburgh . He identified himself by name . He said he was passing through Bolingbrook ; he named a specific place setteral blocks from her home . Then he said : " I 'm going to come over and knock you unconscious and ( force sex on ) you . " She hung up and called the Bolingbrook police . An officer came to her home ; she told him the story . He cruised around the area , and was unable to find anyone suspicious . Months passed . No more letters came ; no more calls . Then , last week ? with her husband gone again Linne 's phone rang at night . " Linne , this is .... " the man said . It was a different name , but she thought she recognized the Voice . " Who are you ? " she said . " I used to work with you at the airport , " he said . She remembered that she had written to the man that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day you passed out at the airport ? " the man 's voice said . " I wanted to call and ? see how you were doing . " LINNE STARTED to scream ; she told the man to get off the line . She hung up , but he did n't ; every time she would ? pick the phone up , he was'still there . Finally he disconnected . Linne immediately called the Bolingbrook police ; she said an officer came to her house , and that she showed him all of the man 's letters . " The policeman told me that there was n't much that he could do , " Linne said " The man had n't ' committed a . crime ; and anyway , I had initiated the contact by my letter to the magazine . " ( The Bolingbrook police confirm that they were , indeed , contacted by Linne on both nights in question . ) Now her husband is still gone almost every night , of the week . Linne sits home alone with her child . Every  --  time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night , she feels the chill run through her . " I realize that it was my fault for asking for pen pals , " she said . " But I get so lonely , and I thought that would help . I do n't blame anyone but myself . But I do n't know what to do . I put myself in this situation , and I have the feeling that I 'll have to get raped or killed before anyone can do anything . " Terror , when it enters a person 's life , often conies not with a great flash , of drama . . . .
