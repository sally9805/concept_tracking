He won 105 hands , loses trial <P> <P> Beefy , none too tall and often clad in blue jeans and tennis shoes , Flea Market Merchant Giovanni Vigliotto seemed an unlikely Casanova . Yet in a Phoenix courtroom , Vigliotto submitted a list of 105 women from 18 states and nine foreign countries he claims to have wooed and wed over the past 20 years , some of them more than once and all without benefit of intervening divorces . A jury of eight men and four women , impressed with his stamina but not his style , last week convicted Vigliotto on charges of bigamy and fraud in his marriage to Patricia Ann Gardiner , 42 , a Mesa , Ariz. , real estate agent . <P> Gardiner testified that she married Vigliotto in November 1981 , eight days after meeting him at a local swap meet . She said he told her that he had $49 million in savings and owned the Queen Mary ocean liner docked in Long Beach , Calif . " He looked right into my face and eyes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He promptly persuaded his bride to sell her house , and they set off for the California coast in separate cars , with Vigliotto driving a van loaded with $36,000 worth of her cash and valuables . By the time she reached a San Diego hotel , she was alone except for her pet poodle . <P> Joan Bacarella of Englishtown , N.J. , testified that Vigliotto proposed a day after they met in February 1981 , urging her to divorce her estranged husband . She said that she realized her " prince had turned into a frog " when he borrowed $1,600 in cash and $40,000 worth of inventory from her clothing shop and then failed to return to a motel where she was waiting with her mother and three children . Another of Vigliotto 's wives , Sharon Clark of Angola , Ind. , told the jury that she was abandoned barefoot and $49,000 poorer in an Ontario motel three weeks after their June 1981 wedding . But Clark tracked her larcenous Lothario for three months and 10,000 miles to a Florida shopping center , where she turned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona on charges filed by Gardiner . <P> Vigliotto , who is in his early 50s , faces up to 34 years in prison . Although he conceded making the multiple marriages ( and adopting some 50 aliases ) , he denied defrauding any of his wives . He claimed he worked as a contract agent for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 and 1954 before getting into the flea market business . During the five-week trial , boisterous crowds , often outfitted with bags of food and drinks in ice chests , waited in line for a seat in the small courtroom and a chance to hear the latest installment of Vigliotto 's romantic adventures . After the verdict , Gardiner said of the women who succumbed : " I do n't think they fell for him . They found someone who told them what they needed and wanted to hear at that time in their lives .
