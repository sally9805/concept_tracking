On the road that leads to Gaza , a gaudily lettered arch greets travelers with the word WELCOME . But the sights hardly beckon . Watchful Israeli soldiers stand guard as men in gallabiyas ply the road on two-wheeled donkey carts and women in white gauze veils trail their robes through the dust . Melons are sold amid reeking garbage . Rusting wreckage litters the roadsides . The stench of rot and waste is unescapable . Gaza looks like what it is : the last refuge of the dispossessed . <P> Gaza has never been anything but occupied territory , in thrall for 500 years to the Ottoman Empire , then to Britain , then Egypt , now Israel . Approximately 28 miles long and five miles wide , Gaza teems with more than 600,000 Palestinians , nearly all of whom fare worse than their 800,000 brethren in the Israeli-occupied West Bank . Wedged between Egypt and Israel , Gaza nonetheless appeared to harbor little of the rebellious anger that seethes in the Palestinian towns in the West Bank . But that is changing . Violent anti-Israel protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight Palestinians , including a 17-year-old schoolgirl , and one government security agent have been killed . The smell of burning tires and gunpowder now mingles with the stink of sewage . <P> After occupying Gaza in 1967 , Israel gradually claimed one-third of the strip as " state land " and built 18 Israeli settlements for about 2,200 Jews . Life is far more cramped for Gaza 's Palestinians : some 5,440 people occupy each square mile , a density that approaches Hong Kong 's . The Jews inhabit a beach-front enclave that is fast growing into an Israeli Riviera . But more than 60% of Gaza 's Arabs are refugees , most of whom live in squalid United Nations camps built 40 years ago . In the camp of Nuseirat , Sabha , a 50-year- old woman , finds only despair . " There is no way of getting out of this muddy life unless a miracle occurs , " she said . " But the time of miracles has gone . " <P> Most Gazans must earn their meager daily bread in Israel . Some 50,000 jam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haul garbage and build houses . By supplying Israel with cheap labor , Gaza has virtually eliminated unemployment . Even so , Palestinians deeply resent the forced dependence . " We are enslaved , " says Rashad Shawwa , 79 , mayor of Gaza , who was twice removed from office by Israeli officials . " We have become the servants of Israel . " <P> Israel strictly controls Gaza 's commerce , including its primary crops of oranges , lemons and limes , to ensure that the occupied land does not compete with Israel . For security reasons , Israel has limited Gaza 's second major industry , fishing , to a narrow slice of the Mediterranean . The result is a retarded economy , with little prospect for growth . Brigadier General Shai Eres , who until last month headed Gaza 's civil administration , admits that the shackled economy severely limits the region 's prospects . Says Eres : " Of course , there is no independence possible for this area . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
