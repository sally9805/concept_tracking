Since the U.S. resumed military aid last fall to the contras in their seven- year-old war against the Marxist-oriented Sandinista government , the rebels have left their training camps in Honduras and established new bases inside Nicaragua . Their aim has been to resupply troops in the northern province of Jinotega . While still small in number , the camps are becoming an important adjunct to the air-supply operations that furnish rebels in Nicaragua with the bulk of their food and weapons . <P> With the contra military effort in full swing last week , moderate Rebel Leader Alfonso Robelo said he would not seek re-election to the directorate of the United Nicaraguan Opposition , the umbrella group that oversees contra operations . Robelo 's move , coupled with last month 's resignation of fellow Moderate Arturo Cruz , could greatly strengthen the political role of Adolfo Calero , leader of the main contra military organization , the Nicaraguan Democratic Force . Amid the swirling political crosscurrents , TIME Correspondent Ricardo Chavira visited several contra bases last week in Nicaragua . His report : <P> The banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages . Until the early 1980s the Sumos , surrounded by dense tropical forest , farmed and fished as they had for centuries . The Indians are gone now , forcibly moved to Sandinista resettlement camps , and the once sleepy river teems with guerrillas of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force . Rebel dugout canoes ply the Bocay deep into Nicaragua 's Jinotega province , carrying food and ammunition to contras in the interior . <P> The lifeline begins at a camp at a hidden airstrip along the Nicaraguan- Honduran border . From there , goods are piled into motor-driven dugouts and shipped down the Bocay to remote supply points . Much of the traffic goes through a hilltop base deep inside the jungle . Armed guards are posted outside the facility , which is little more than a day 's march from the fighting in central Jinotega . At the base , located some 25 miles inside Nicaragua , boxes of ammunition and mortar rounds are secured beneath camouflaged tarpaulins , and a radio operator maintains static-filled contact with forces far to the south . <P> " This is the axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Comandante 42 , the second in command of an 800-man force that protects the supply lines . The axis , though , is fragile . Contra sentries are posted up and down the river , but Sandinista troops may lie in ambush . Government patrols can call in air support when they encounter the guerrillas . <P> Even so , the perilously thin lifeline has lifted the contras ' spirits and military fortunes . " These bases are an important advance for us , " says Comandante 42 . " The big difference in the past few months is that our men can get resupplied here rather than at the border . " Sandinista troops showed just how dangerous border supply operations can be when they overran the main contra base near Yamales , Honduras , in March 1986 , with a 3,000-man force . The rebels beat back the soldiers after a nine-day battle .
