The official , who is familiar with details of the Iceland talks , said the President ' s comments fell far short of a " formal agreement " and the talks ended without time " to get down to the nuts and bolts " of such a ban. // The Soviet Union never contended that there had been " formal agreement . " Mr. Gorbachev , in a broadcast speech Wednesday , said , " The President did , albeit without special enthusiasm , consent to the elimination of all strategic offensive arms . " <> <> Advisers ' Concern Recalled // The White House official , who spoke on condition that his name not be used , suggested that Mr. Reagan might not have reflected the concern of his advisers about the dangers inherent in agreeing to a sweeping ban on all strategic , or long-range , offensive forces. // The advisers , he said , had cautioned the President to limit a ban to ballistic missiles to prevent Moscow from capitalizing on its superiority in conventional forces. // This was the latest and most explicit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet side had been quoting Mr. Reagan more or less correctly. // The initial American response was to avoid comment on the Soviet charges that the United States was providing a distorted version of what happened in Iceland. // Although the overall accord fell apart over the issue of the United States ' space-based missile-defense program , the question of what was agreed to had become an issue. // In Moscow on Saturday , Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh , a Deputy Foreign Minister , took the unusual step of making public what he said were quotations by Mr. Reagan seeming to endorse Mr. Gorbachev ' s idea of a ban on all strategic forces , including missiles and bombers , within 10 years. // Administration officials expressed indignation at publication of the Soviet version , but privately sought to preserve its credibility with the Russians . <> <> Soviet Assertion Not Disputed // Today , the White House official said he would not dispute Mr. Bessmertnykh ' s assertions. // But , officially , the White House continued to maintain that , in terms of formal proposals , the United States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with offensive ballistic missiles , of all ranges , to be eliminated by the end of the 10-year period. // In his initial reports on the Iceland summit meeting , Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the two sides had been close to an accord banning all strategic weapons . He said this in his news conference in Reykjavik after the meeting , and again on Oct. 14 during a briefing at the White House for members of Congress. // But when Senator Sam Nunn , Democrat of Georgia and a specialist on military matters , criticized the wisdom of a ban on all strategic nuclear forces , Mr. Shultz put the stress on the formal American proposal to ban only ballistic missiles , and not on what Mr. Reagan might have said to Mr. Gorbachev. // Mr. Shultz said in his Iceland news conference , on Oct. 12 , that the effort to agree on an overall 10-year arms accord had failed over Soviet insistence on linking the accord to limits on the United States ' missile defense program during that period. // " As the **30;9517;TOOLONG said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , all offensive strategic arms and ballistic missiles would be eliminated . " ' Insurance Policy ' for U.S. This was important , he said , because it meant that any missile defense that might be deployed after 1996 would be needed only as a kind of " insurance policy , insurance against cheating , insurance against somebody getting hold of these weapons. " // Later that evening , the meaning of what Mr. Shultz had said was clouded when three American arms-control experts briefed reporters without knowing the details of the final Reagan-Gorbachev meeting. // They said the United States had agreed only to a 50 percent cut in all strategic weapons during the first five years and had proposed a ban on all ballistic missiles during the second five years . They left the impression that Mr. Shultz might have misspoken. // But on Oct. 14 , at a briefing for members of Congress , Mr. Shultz repeated what he had said in Iceland , according to Senator Nunn. // " Secretary Shultz revealed that General Secretary Gorbachev made a counteroffer to the U.S. proposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed that during the second half of the 10-year period , all remaining strategic offensive nuclear arms and not just ballistic missiles would be eliminated . Secretary Shultz then informed the members present at the briefing that during the discussions that followed between the two leaders , we compromised and agreed that the language of this agreement would refer to ' strategic nuclear arms and ballistic missiles. ' " // Senator Nunn said that , in the question period with Mr. Reagan that day , the Senator asked whether the President had agreed with Mr. Gorbachev " to eliminate all strategic offensive arms by 1996. " // " I paused and the President nodded affirmatively , " the Senator later recalled . <> <> The Problem of Imbalance // The Senator said that he then questioned how the West proposed to correct the imbalance in conventional forces in the absence of nuclear weapons. // Mr. Shultz interjected , the Senator recalled , that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization " could find the will to provide a conventional balance with the Warsaw Pact. " // Senator Nunn made his comments in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticism , then modified his previous comments to stress that the United States , in its formal proposal , had limited itself to a ban only on ballistic missiles , of all ranges , leaving 50 percent of the cruise missile and the bomber force. // Today , the senior White House official gave this account of the final hours at Iceland. // The United States first proposed that the two sides adhere to the 1972 antiballstic missile treaty for 10 more years and , at the same time , agree to a 50 percent cut in all strategic weapons during the first five years , and on a ban of all offensive ballistic missiles in the second five-year period. // The Soviet side countered with a proposal to eliminate the remaining 50 percent of all strategic forces during the second five-year period . When Mr. Reagan ' s advisers met to consider this , they crossed out the proposal for a ban on all strategic forces , and put in the margin " ballistic missiles . " <> <> Reagan ' s Quotation Confirmed // When Mr. Reagan went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant by " strategic forces , " and when it was explained that this included cruise missiles and long-range bombers as well as ballistic missiles , Mr. Reagan said , as quoted by Mr. Bessmertnykh : " Apparently we misunderstood you . But if that is what you want , all right. " // On the broader possibility of ridding the world of all nuclear arms , including medium-range , short-range and battlefield weapons , the Soviet version quoted Mr. Reagan as having said : // " If we agree that by the end of the 10-year period , all nuclear arms are to be eliminated , we can refer this to our delegations in Geneva to prepare an agreement that you could sign during your visit to the United States. " // The White House official , in not disputing this quotation , said nothing was " fleshed out " and the discussion " petered out , " without Mr. Reagan agreeing to anything concrete . <> <> Proposals to Be Presented // In a related development , Administration officials said the Reagan Administration decided today to authorize its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States had advanced to the Soviet Union at the Iceland summit meeting. // The decision was made at a meeting attended by President Reagan and the National Security Council planning group , the officials said. // The action had been expected because White House officials publicly stated the intention of the Administration to reintroduce its Iceland proposals in Geneva. // There had been some question , however , about what position the Joint Chiefs of Staff would take on the advisability of eliminating all ballistic missiles . The Joint Chiefs were not consulted before the President made his proposal to eliminate the missiles in 10 years. // The Administration previously authorized its negotiators in Geneva to propose the measures on medium-range forces that were discussed in Iceland . Officials also previously authorized the American negotiators to discuss a limit of 1 , 600 on missiles and bombers , and a limit of 6 , 000 on ballistic missile and air-launched cruise missile warheads agreed upon in Iceland. // But until today , the Administration had not authorized negotiators to present other American proposals , specifically , Mr. Reagan ' s prosposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to seek the elimination of all ballistic missiles within that time period. // At the meeting today , the Joint Chiefs supported Mr. Reagan ' s proposal to eliminate all ballistic missiles but needed to study further the implications of such a move . The Joint Chiefs said that if ballistic missiles were abolished the United States would need to improve its conventional forces , Administration officials said. //
