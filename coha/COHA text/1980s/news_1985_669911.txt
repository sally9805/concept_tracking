The University of Miami " is not a campus with visible school spirit , just visible tan lines . " Emory University ' s " most salient feature " is apathy . The Arizona State campus looks like Disneyland . And by the way , there are 1 , 300 toilets on the University of Idaho campus . Who says so ? None other than Lisa Birnbach . Fresh from her triumph as editor of " The Official Preppy Handbook , " Ms. Birnbach is now giving the lowdown on the higher-education scene in " Lisa Birnbach ' s College Book " ( Ballantine , 515 pages , $9. 95 ) . It ' s an even more fertile endeavor than taking potshots at preppies . For all their new emphasis on marketing , colleges rate a C-minus at best in telling what it ' s like to attend them . Traditional college guides aren ' t much better . They tend to be heavy with facts and light on flavor . Not so " Lisa Birnbach ' s College Book . " Forget about the student-faculty ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Ms. Birnbach . Forget about academics , too , for that matter . Her premise is that all of the schools in her book provide a good education , so let ' s turn to what really matters  --  what ' s life like at the college , what do people there say about it ? And where ' s the best pizza ? Ms. Birnbach says that to find out , she visited each of the 186 colleges mentioned in her book . She talked with students , faculty and staff , attended classes and school functions , and ate what the students ate . " Typically , I spent a day and often an evening as well , " she says . To supplement her reporting , she submitted questionnaires to students beforehand . Sometimes she got 10 back , sometimes one or two . The result of this blitzkrieg research is a readable but uneven collection of opinions about colleges . Ms. Birnbach , for example , provides a good account of what it is like to be at Brown , her alma mater ( " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . And they are " ) , but strangely has a hard time getting a handle on Harvard , concentrating more on who went there , or dropped by , than about life on campus . Duke University " has the kind of students who make their parents proud , " says Ms. Birnbach . The Durham , N.C. , campus is friendly " but not that friendly . One must establish a foothold in one ' s natural group in order to feel comfortable . " The favorite drink : Stroh ' s beer . Fraternities : " very strong . " Academic pressure : " pretty high . " Judgments and facts about the schools are often provided by anonymous students ( " Don ' t blame me for the results  --  it ' s their opinion , not mine , " says Ms. Birnbach ) . And so one wonders whether the opinions represent any sort of consensus or whether they just happen to be the most quotable . Is it general knowledge at Lake Forest College in Illinois , for example , that " you ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a car , yell at a teacher or something " ? And at Grinnell College , do out-of-state undergraduates really refer to Iowa public-school students as " eraser faces " because they all look alike ? Part of the problem in accepting these statements is that Ms. Birnbach ' s book , which could easily have been titled " The Encyclopedia of College Trivia , " already suffers from a number of questionable facts . The executive assistant to the president of Stephens College in Columbia , Mo. , was startled to find herself listed as the best professor at the school . No doubt Notre Dame was equally surprised to be placed in Fort Wayne , Ind . The UCLA grad who headed the Atomic Energy Commission was Glenn T. Seaborg , not Glen Seaburg . Heart surgeon Michael DeBakey didn ' t attend the University of Texas ; it was colleague Denton Cooley . And yes , John F. Kennedy did put in 47 days at Princeton , but is that enough to put him on the list of 46 famous alumni when that well-known Princeton dropout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s being picky about a book designed to be as much fun as it is informative . Want to know the favorite drinking game at Laid Back U. ? Try consulting " Lisa Birnbach ' s College Book . " ( Most likely the game is " Quarters , " a test of skill in bouncing a quarter into a glass of beer . ) What ' s the story on campus parking ? The book has the definitive survey . And where else can one learn about the best off- and on-campus hangouts , the gay and minority situations and which college infirmaries take an active role in birth control ? Ms. Birnbach also offers 18 essays on what ' s happening on campus in the 1980s plus " silly and immature charts , graphs and quizzes "  --  Mad magazine-style humor  --  that " should not necessarily be taken seriously . " Should any part of the book be taken seriously ? Well , some colleges that think they ' ve gotten a bad shake are grumbling , but any fears that " Lisa Birnbach ' s College Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably groundless . The fact is that current underclassmen and alumni will get more out of the book than college seekers . Just a word of caution : Don ' t bet the tuition on the trivia.  --  - Mr. May is a news editor of the Journal.
