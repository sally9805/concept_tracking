Not enough fuel for the fleet <P> To beef up the Navy , the Reagan Administration has almost doubled the money spent on building new ships and warplanes hi the past three years . Yet if war broke out , the Navy would still not be able to send to sea enough carriers or air wings to fight effectively , according to a study released last week by the General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress . <P> Traditionally , Congress and the Pentagon like to build showy weapons systems but tend to skimp on less glamorous things . The Administration has increased spending on maintenance , spare parts , fuel and other elements of combat " readiness " by only 7% . As a result , states the GAO report , only eight of the Navy 's 14 aircraft carriers could put to sea within two months of the outbreak of war , and only 60% of its warplanes are combat ready . <P> Navy Secretary John Lehman insists that he is trying hard to overcome the readiness neglect of the past ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , and the Navy now has 20% more combat-ready planes . <P> The GAO , however , claims that the Navy overstates its readiness statistics and that in any case will not meet its own requirements until 1990 .
