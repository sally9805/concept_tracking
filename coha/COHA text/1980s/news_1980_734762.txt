txt Big-time auto racing in Grant Park ? That is a happy daydream for Arnie Morton , the restaurateur , and other promoters of a two-day racing extravaganza next July 4 weekend , using Grant Park between the band shell and Soldier Field as the race course . They have dazzled Mayor Byrne with tae prospect of a glamorous international event , attracting a cosmopolitan crowd not only to the races but to Chicago hotels and restaurants . But it is a nightmare for officials of Grant Park museums and for Chicagoans accustomed to thinking of city parks as tranquil refuges from the hustle and bustle of city life . Auto racing is undeniably a popular sport with a big following  --  and undeniably highly dangerous . The special vehicles that compete in races usually perform in special places , like the Indianapolis Speedway . Precedents for big-time racing on city streets exist only In Long Beach and Monaco . Cris Pook , the organizer of the Long Beach Grand Prix , is an expert witness would cost $2 million to 83 million dot lays , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done properly .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park is not to do it . The idea of attracting visitors to Chi . cago , the country 's premier convention city , is of course familiar and generally commendable . But no single convention , however big or rowdy , could interfere with access to the city 's public parks and museums , or entail the kind of capital expenditure that a major auto race in Grant Park would require . The decision on whether to go ahead with the project  --  assuming that the racing fraternity would cooperate ? Is essentially a political one . The idea is that the event would be sponsored by the mayor 's office , with any profit or loss going to the city . Striking a balance between glameroue publicity on the world 's TV screens and a harsh , negative impact on the quality of life in Chicago is a matter of judgment . Mayor Byrne has shown little resistance to glamorous Ideas for luring big spenders to Chicago ? e.g. , her advocacy of casino gambling .
