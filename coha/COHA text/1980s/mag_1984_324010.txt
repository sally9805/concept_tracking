Pinochet-withstands a protest <P> Armed with homemade Molotov cocktails , guns , wooden sticks , nails and even arrows , slumdwellers near Santiago prepared for clashes with police . Some Chileans turned their homes into hospitals , bracing for severe government reprisals . Doctors and nurses stood ready to attend the injured . <P> As the people prepared , so did the government . It imposed a 48-hour curfew to limit street demonstrations . Ironically , the curfew made Chile 's 24-hour general strike last week far more effective than widespread street rioting would have been . Fed up with the ten-year-old regime of General Augusto Pinochet , thousands of Chileans kept their children home from school to protest their country 's 30% unemployment and 30% inflation .

By the end of the week , seven demonstrators had died , about 30 had been wounded and 400 had been arrested in eight cities . Police and soldiers did not roam the streets shooting and clubbing protesters at random , as they had done during the past five protests since last spring .

He has , if anything , become more determined to keep a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and external criticism . There are signs that his once unswerving military support has been reduced to a small core of hard-line generals . Various governments around the world have openly criticized him in recent months . For Pinochet , the most stinging criticism comes from the U.S. : only minutes before the protest began , the State Department sent a telex to the Chilean government urging it to enter into a dialogue with its opposition . So far Pinochet prefers to conduct his dialogues alone .
