In Geneva it was the U.S. against the world <P> The outcome of last week 's World Health Organization vote was never in doubt . Delegates to the WHO meeting in Geneva were considering an international code of conduct to restrict the advertising and marketing of baby formula , a processed , usually powdered substitute for mother 's milk . The formula can lead to infant malnutrition and death when used improperly , so the WHO code had the support of doctors and government health officials all over the planet . The final tally was 118 to 1 , a near miracle of consensus in any international forum . Which nation was it that cast the only no vote , thus appearing to align itself in opposition to good health for babies ? The U.S. <P> That dissent , ordered by the White House and based on concern that the code would restrict free speech and free trade , touched off a wave of outrage , much of it in the U.S. Dr. Stephen Joseph , the top health official at the U.S. Agency for International Development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resigned their jobs in protest . Joseph called the vote " contrary to the best interests of my country , inexplicable to my professional colleagues . . . and damaging to the health and growth of the world 's children . " Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts convened an unofficial hearing on the U.S. dissent , which he denounced as " shameful . " Republican Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon warned that the vote could send " a message of indifference to the sanctity of human life . " Outside the U.S. , the reaction was more puzzlement than anger , though even London 's conservative Financial Times declared , " It is special pleading of the worst kind to invoke the right to free expression and free competition if a potential danger to life and health has been identified . " <P> The infant-formula controversy began about ten years ago , when Dr. Derrick Jelliffer , a public health specialist , declared that infant malnutrition could be linked to the use of baby formula . That substance , usually made from a milk base with vegetable fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if correctly used . In poor areas of the world , however , that is sometimes impossible . Mothers may unknowingly mix powdered formula with contaminated water or , to save money , dilute it too much . Moreover , breast feeding is healthier and more economical , assuming a baby 's mother is healthy and able to produce adequate nourishment for her child . <P> Critics have also complained that the infant-formula industry , which has world-wide sales of $2 billion , compounded those hazards by stepping up marketing efforts in Third World countries . Some of the sales tactics were questionable . Employees of some formula companies , dressed as medical personnel , would go from village to village promoting the products . New mothers were routinely given advertising brochures and free samples while still in the hospital .
