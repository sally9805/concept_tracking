Bleary-eyed but triumphant at 5:40 a.m. , Canada 's ten provincial premiers and Brian Mulroney , the Federal Prime Minister , emerged from a 20-hour negotiating session last week and proclaimed that their country was finally one . Back in 1982 , after 115 years of British stewardship , Canada 's constitution had been given over to Ottawa 's direct control . But the French-speaking province of Quebec refused to sign the charter , charging that then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was using the document to dilute French Canada . In April of this year , Mulroney and the provinces hammered out a delicate agreement recognizing Quebec as a " distinct society " and permitting it a larger degree of autonomy . Yet some premiers soon had qualms over the favors granted French Canadians and forced Mulroney into last week 's marathon renegotiation . By sunrise , there was accord on provincial rights , and the premiers signed the constitution . " Today , " said an ecstatic Mulroney , " we welcome Quebec into the constitutional family .
