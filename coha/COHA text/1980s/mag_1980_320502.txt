High court rules on abortions , race quotas , open trials , safety rules <P> Sooner or later the most complex and explosive emotional issues in U.S. society come before the Supreme Court . Rarely , however , has the court handed down so many decisions of such importance as it did last week . In a mere three days at the end of its 1979-80 term , the court settled cases involving the angrily disputed questions of abortion , racial quotas , freedom of the press , and the right of federal regulators to impose heavy financial burdens on business in the interest of worker safety . <P> The Justices ruled : <P> &gt; That Congress and the states may refuse to pay for abortions sought by poor women , even when doctors deem the abortions to be " medically necessary . " The vote : 5 to 4 . <P> &gt; That Congress may require 10% of the money spent on a federally funded public works program to go only to contracting firms controlled by members of racial and ethnic minority groups . The vote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials to the press and public , except under special circumstances , such as when public attendance might jeopardize the fairness of the trial . This was the high court 's first assertion of a constitutional basis for the press 's " right of access " to important public information . The vote : 7 to 1 . <P> &gt; That a regulatory agency could not force companies to reduce the amount of benzene in the air breathed by workers if it merely believed , without proof , that this action would safeguard the workers ' health . The ruling implied that regulators could not free a workplace of all risks to health and should not try . The vote : 5 to 4 . <P> Momentous as these decisions were , they were announced with little ah " of drama . On Wednesday , when the final three decisions came down , some two dozen reporters jammed the basement pressroom of the Supreme Court building and grabbed for copies , prompting a court employee to snap : " Behave ! " But upstairs in the ornate red-draped courtroom , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on . The black-robed Justices referred to the cases by their uninformative docket names ( the quotas case , for example , was identified as Fullilove vs . Klutznick ) , and Chief Justice Warren Burger announced two of the decisions by droning , " We affirm . . . We reverse . " <P> The importance of the stakes , however , was underscored by the extraordinary vehemence of some of the dissenting opinions . In the abortion case , Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted that the majority ruling would drive many women " to back-alley butchers . " Justice Potter Stewart chose to dramatize his dissent in the contracting-quotas case by reading it aloud . He accused the court majority in effect of endorsing " racism , " and he practically spat out the word . Justice John Paul Stevens added that if race is to be a criterion for receiving public funds , the Government will have to start spelling out who belongs to what race . He bitterly suggested as a model a Nazi law defining who is to be considered a Jew .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
