But even the best-laid plans can get caught in red tape . At a House hearing on the homeless last week , Paul Wright of the General Accounting Office , Congress 's audit agency , said most of the money had been spent on routine base maintenance . " What the Defense Department did was to rob the poor box , " said Democratic Congressman Ted Weiss of New York . <P> The Army , Air Force and Coast Guard had offered the use of vacant defense facilities to more than 600 communities . But many military bases were too remote for the inner-city homeless . One base commander would not permit food at a shelter ; others would not let the poor walk beyond the buildings ' grounds . As a result , there were only two takers for the funds , Philadelphia and California 's Alameda County . Total amount : $900,000 . In August , Defense Department officials realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not spent soon . A House committee went along with their plan to use the money for maintenance . Said Weiss : " We have a more efficient system in the U.S. to deal with stray pets than we have for homeless human beings . "
