" If someone said to me what is the single greatest problem in New York City today , I would say there is no question : the homeless , " said Sarah Connell , regional director of the state ' s Office of Mental Health. // A consent decree is expected to be signed this week specifying that the city should provide shelter and board to each homeless person who applies for it and setting forth standards for the quality of the facilities . <> <> Increasing Hostility Evident // But , with some exceptions , many neighborhoods seem to be increasingly hostile to providing either permanent shelters or temporary facilities for homeless people , as the following recent developments indicate : // - The city , under court order to find more beds for homeless men , approached every community board in the city and could not find a neighborhood in any borough that was willing to accept a new 200-to 300-bed facility for men in its area . The state has just approved a plan for a new 450-bed shelter on Wards Island , a nonresidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and referral center for former mental patients scheduled to be opened by the city later this year at 88th Street and Amsterdam Avenue has drawn vehement protests from residents in the immediate area . They say it will endanger the neighborhood and they have hired a lawyer to bring suit against the city in an attempt to halt the project. // - Residents who live near the First Moravian Church at 30th Street and Lexington Avenue asked the Board of Estimate not to renew a grant to the church , which provides meals , counseling and other help to about 200 homeless people each day . On Thursday , the board voted to renew the grant despite the opposition of the local community board. // The consent decree stems from a class-action suit filed in 1979 on behalf of the city ' s homeless men . It is expected to be signed by representatives of the city and state on one side and the plaintiffs on the other. <> <> 36 , 000 Homeless in City // The Community Service Society of New York estimates that there are 36 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is that the number seems to be increasing . No longer relegated to the Bowery and the shabbier neighborhoods , they are now part of the fabric of the city as they wander about clutching their tattered bundles and trying to protect themselves from the grim vicissitudes of life on the street. // " They are now touching almost every neighborhood in the city , " said Mrs. Connell of the regional Office of Mental Health . " They are becoming the brunt of everybody ' s negative feelings and they are presenting this society with one of its greatest challenges . A society is really judged by how it takes care of its least desirable people and we are not doing a very good job of it. " // The growth is attributed to the tightening of eligibility restrictions for welfare ; the loss of more than 25 , 000 rooms due to the closing of single-room occupancy hotels , which used to be the traditional refuge of people with marginal incomes , and to stricter standards of admission in state psychiatric hospitals. // Also raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and on which there is as yet no definitive data . This is the presence of young men in their 20 ' s and 30 ' s whom Mrs. Connell refers to as " a new generation of urban nomads. " // " What we know about them comes from the impression of our staff at the centers , " said Stanley Hoffman , director of research and evaluation in the New York City regional branch of the Office of Mental Health . " They are relatively well-educated , relatively wellfunctioning , well-traveled , middle-class dropouts , who have learned to maneuver the system and who move around . " <> <> Neighborhood a ' Disaster Area ' // Indicative of how passionate neighborhood feelings can become is a letter to Mayor Koch from Gertrude Huston , secretary of Community Board 5 who lives a few doors from the First Moravian Church and has been canvassing the area with city officials in an attempt to find another site for the program in a less residential neighborhood. // " Since the program opened , this has been a disaster area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vestibules have been invaded by derelicts and bag people - and their urine and their feces . Some of us have been physically attacked by the more violent of the church ' s clients. // " A bag person couple were seen fornicating on the church steps one afternoon . Some of their male clients lie on our sidewalks exposing their genitalia . All of this , and there is more , is not only disgusting and dangerous to our adult population , but we have young children living here as well. " // City officials testified before the Board of Estimate last week that efforts would be made to improve conditions . The state and the city have had a long standing argument about whether it is more desirable to have large shelters to house the homeless , such as the Men ' s Shelter at 8 East Third Street , which feeds about 1200 men a day , or smaller residences within communities. // The state ' s position is that these men and women are frightened , vulnerable people to whom even the most minor occurrence can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by large institutions such as the men ' s shelter . <> <> A Danger in Large Facilities // " The danger with very , very large facilities is that you comingle people with very different needs and that can lead to a chaotic situation , " said the state ' s Social Services Commissioner , Barbara B. Blum. // The city says , in effect , that it is unrealistic to believe that enough community acceptance can be found in communities throughout the city to meet the need . Additionally , officials say , large shelters are economically more feasible and the cost of establishing small residences would be economically prohibitive . There are now about a dozen or so privately sponsored shelters throughout the city. // The city shelters include the Men ' s Shelter at 8 East Third Street , which houses 70 people and feeds about 1 , 200 others daily , who have been supplied with vouchers for nearby hotels ; the Keener Building on Wards Island , which houses 400 men with another shelter for 450 men expected to be built by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shelters about 1 , 100 people , with two new dormitories scheduled for a total capacity of 650 men ; the Women ' s Shelter at 350 Lafayette Street , which houses 47 women , and the Bushwick annex in Brooklyn , which houses about 180 women. // The total annual cost for these shelter operations , which is shared by the city and the state , is $11. 3 million. //
