While the U.S. garment industry has been going through some dark days , both literally and figuratively , the early spring and resort-wear fashions for 1984 now on display in designer showrooms are the brightest and boldest in several seasons . America 's fashion pacesetters are counting on the economic recovery to make women more confident and carefree when they shop for clothes . A year ago , in the midst of the recession , muted pastel tones dominated the top designers ' collections , but now the lines shine with brassy shades of red , blue and green . In the way they are cut and the way they flow , the new tops , skirts and dresses are daring , distinctive and sometimes a bit naughty . Observes Kalman Ruttenstein , a vice president at Bloomingdale 's , Manhattan 's ultra-chic department store : " Often in tough economic times , designers lose their sense of whimsy and feel that women prefer to invest in serious clothing . But this season the clothes are perky and upbeat . " Perry Ellis is showing a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side to uncover a shoulder , as Jennifer Beals ' sweatshirt did in the movie Flashdance . <P> Expected price range : $50 to $150 . Calvin Klein is offering a sleek and sexy new backless sundress ( $190 ) . For buyers wanting something a little more modest , Klein has oversize chambray linen shirt dresses ( $290 ) that can be tied tight at the waist or left free to ripple in the wind . <P> For hemline watchers , the news is mixed . Some designers are still trying to revive miniskirts , but in general , hemlines are going down , reaching to mid-calf or even lower . Explains Zack Carr , head of Klein 's design studio : " The longer length looks more relaxed and gives a sense of languidness . " <P> Some designers have taken striking new directions . <P> Ralph Lauren , whose Southwest look a few seasons ago sparked interest in prairie skirts and cowboy shirts , is now touting a nautical line designed to make lifelong landlubbers look as if they belonged on a yacht . The centerpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braided gold trim and shiny brass buttons , for $470 . <P> Norma Kamali , who stormed the fashion world with her sweatsuit look in 1981 , is now unveiling the " super dirndl , " an haute couture version of the traditional peasant dress still worn in Austria and parts of Germany . With their tight torsos and broad , billowing skirts , the Kamali dresses ( $96 ) are sure to turn heads . To go with her clothes , the designer has come up with perhaps the most eccentric item of the season : pigskin high-heel shoes encased in vulcanized rubber that lace up over the ankles ( $45 ) . Kamali may give new life to the old rock-'n ' - roll exhortation from the mid- ' 60s : <P> " Put on your high-heel sneakers ! "
