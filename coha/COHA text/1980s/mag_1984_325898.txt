A few years ago , Anne Tyler was interviewing Eudora Welty , and they got on the subject of driving . Welty , who was getting up in age , allowed that she continued to drive but that she found propelling herself off the approach ramp onto superhighways particularly difficult , like insinuating yourself into a game of hot pepper , the furiously fast jump-rope play that still goes on in schoolyards everywhere . The sharpness of the image suggested a writer 's mind at work , which in fact was the case . <P> A few days ago ( April 13 , to be exact ) , Eudora Welty turned 75 , and again a question surfaced concerning motoring one 's aged self around . Welty said she continued to take the wheel , even though she found this approach-ramp business " like trying to enter an eggbeater . " The vividness of the simile shows an author still polishing , still looking for the sharpest edge ; it is a reflection of Welty today . <P> Recognizing her skills as well as her birthday , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Jackson , the capital and her home town , Millsaps College tossed a three-day " Southern literary festival " honoring the occasion . The affair drew pipe-smoking academics , fellow successful novelists and short-story writers , worshipful young writers-to-be , men who have had intimate relationships with plows , veiny-handed country women , root pullers-friends all . <P> Wearing an orchid corsage the size of a catcher 's mitt , the stooped honoree attended the whole symposium , a taxing thing when you consider the hard slogging certain scholars can subject an audience to . " I just feel like , well , it 's all for me , and it would be rude to miss one of the speakers , " she said early on . " I can just hear my mother saying , ' Girl , you 're getting a little too much attention , ' " she said toward the end . <P> It was not always so , as one speaker recalled , reading reviews from nearly a half-century ago : " Clear as literary gumbo " ; " Easy to read as a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Republic critic found Delta Wedding such tough going he did not finish the book . And Diana Trilling said of the same creation that she was vexed trying to determine " how much of my distaste " had to do with the work and how much to do with the culture . <P> With The Golden Apples , published in 1949 , Welty began being praised for her command of narrative technique . The Optimist 's Daughter , 1972 , won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction . This year , a year that seems to be her year , she is on the bestseller lists with One Writer 's Beginnings . The sun is indeed shining bright on her old Jackson home , on Pinehurst Street , where she was saying the other morning , " Do sit down . I 'm going to raise a window . " She said she was wondering whether she might not have sounded incoherent at a late hour the night before , when she was called on to respond to some of the papers the literary scholars had presented .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
