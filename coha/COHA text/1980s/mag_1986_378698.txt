The leader of 1 billion Chinese was joking , of course ; he lost part of the hearing in one ear long before he launched the world 's most populous nation on an audacious effort to create what amounts almost to a new form of society . But , as might be expected from the diminutive ( 4 ft. 11 in. ) , steel-hard Deng , 81 , it was a joke with a sharp point . If in his more solemn moments he still attempts to justify what he often calls his " second revolution " in the name of that patron saint of Communist revolution , Karl Marx , Deng is well aware that the system he is evolving in China either ignores or defies many of the precepts most cherished by traditional Marxists ( especially those running the Soviet Union ) . In the Chinese spirit of balance between yin and yang , Deng 's second revolution is an attempt on a monumental scale to blend seemingly irreconcilable elements : state ownership and private property , central planning and competitive markets , political dictatorship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost , or so it often seems to skeptics in both the Western and Marxist worlds , an attempt to combine Communism and capitalism . <P> It is also a high-risk gamble . The elements may prove truly irreconcilable , and Deng 's bold experiments could dissolve into economic chaos . It is even possible that they could give way , though probably not until after his death , to at least a partial restoration of the ironfisted , xenophobic rule and extreme regimentation imposed on China by Deng 's predecessor Mao Tse-tung . But in 1985 Deng gave fresh evidence of his determination to push his reforms through to their conclusion , whatever that might be . Having essentially completed a transformation in the countryside , where 80% of China 's masses live , by freeing peasants to grow what they wish and to start private businesses , Deng concentrated on what may be the harder job of bringing change to China 's cities and requiring the managers of state-owned enterprises to behave like profit-hungry , innovative capitalists . <P> Whether this second stage of the second revolution can fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate backwardness into the 20th century by the time the century ends is anyone 's guess . It got off to a somewhat rocky start , and is encountering more opposition than the first , rural stage did . But if it should succeed , the transformation would have profound and enormous consequences throughout the world . <P> The Soviet Union , which has historically feared the Chinese masses on its southeastern border , would face a neighbor considerably strengthened by a triumphant heresy . Communists everywhere , notably in the Third World , would see an alternative to the failures of Soviet-style Marxism . Many of China 's neighbors in the Far East , including Taiwan and South Korea , would find that a political foe had been tamed into a trading partner , while an economic weakling had become a mighty competitor . Most important , perhaps , the U.S. and other Western countries would see the crusading faith that has made the Marxist third of the world an enemy converted into a system that the West could live with and in some respects , though certainly not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
