If the background behind the server is dark up to the height of his head but light higher up , concentrate on picking up the ball as it leaves his hand on the toss . Otherwise , you may lose track of the ball as it crosses into the lighter area , and you won ' t be prepared to hit a good return. // There are players who have trouble with contact lenses drying out when they play indoors . So take along some extra wetting solution to help keep your vision clear. 2 . Shorten your backswing . Many indoor facilities have slick , fast court surfaces . And indoor clay or Har-Tru courts usually don ' t have as much top dressing as outdoor courts of the same material . In both cases , the result is that the ball arrives more quickly than it does outdoors. // So shorten your backswing and learn to take the ball earlier , soon after it bounces . When you take the ball on the rise like this , try closing your racquet face a little at impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of control. // Faster courts also make it more strategically sensible to play attacking tennis . If you have been thinking about adding a serve-and-volley dimension to your game , there ' s no better place to try it than indoors. 3 . Take advantage of the restricted space . Hitting the ball on the rise and attacking the net are also two ways of negating the limited space around and above the court that you often find indoors . If there is reduced room behind the baseline , you better be able to play the ball from a position closer to the baseline or you ' re going to be risking racquet and limb . When you get backed up against the rear screen , you could easily run into a dangerous hidden support. // The lower the ceiling is in an indoor facility , the unhappier lobbers are . So if your indoor court has restricted air space , get up to the net and make your opponent hit passing shots . The building is eliminating one of his options . Conversely , when you lob , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ceiling line . Don ' t hit a high defensive lob straight up . Ease it up along the " V " or " U " line of the roof . If a player ' s shot hits the ceiling , he loses the point. // Finally , take advantage of the dividing netting between the courts by hitting wide serves and angled ground strokes and volleys . For instance , if you are a right-hander with a good slice serve , run your opponent out wide in the deuce court . You may hit some aces if you can break the ball off sharply into the side netting before he can reach it . That isn ' t interference , it ' s a winner . Then when be begins to shade over to cover the wide one , aim a flat serve down the middle . Sound unsporting ? Maybe . But you would lob into the sun if you were playing outdoors , wouldn ' t you ? // During a rally , if you can get your opponent moving rapidly from alley to alley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side screen to retrieve your shot . His uncertainty may produce an error or a weak return . Remember , if you don ' t take advantage of the court dimensions , he probably will. 4 . Warm up , cool down and pace yourself . You ' re inviting an injury if you walk in from the cold and go right out on the court without doing some easy jumping jacks and stretches to get your muscles loose . And you ' re inviting a cold if you jump into your sweats and rush right back outside before cooling down after playing . Use some common sense . You also may find yourself running out of steam before your court time has expired if you don ' t pace yourself while playing . Because court fees are high and conditions are uniform , a lot of indoor players don ' t bother switching sides after odd games , and they rush themselves between points . Not only will you get tired doing this , you ' ll play lousy tennis . The rules say you must change ends after odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking on your court time . You ' ll enjoy the tennis more. 5 . Take a 30-minute lesson . Let ' s say you have a regular 90-minute doubles game once a week , and your group has five players , so you sit out every fifth session . When you do play , you may have up to a dozen rallies that extend beyond three or four shots . That ' s not enough tennis to keep your game at its best . So during your week off , schedule a half-hour lesson . You ' ll hit more balls in those 30 minutes then in one regular doubles outing , and you ' ll probably pick up some excellent pointers , too. // All in all , adjusting to indoor tennis is not that difficult , and you may find that when you begin playing outdoors again , those tricky natural elements will make you long for tennis under cover. //
