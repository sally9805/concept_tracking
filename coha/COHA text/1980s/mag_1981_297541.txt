" Weapons are being treated like commercial articles , just like machine tools or automobiles , " says Arthur Alexander of the Rand Corp . " They talk about quality , performance , price . Look at the catalogues . " He was referring to the arms directories published for prospective buyers by half a dozen national governments . ( The U.S. , where sales catalogues from Sears to the Whole Earth are practically national icons , has none . ) The most elaborate are put out by Britain and France . Both distribute slick omnibus arms compendia , Britain every year since 1969 , France biannually since 1967 , that the world 's wish-listing generals and defense ministers can flip through with the delight of boys at Christmas time . There are no order forms or suggested retail prices . But whether they prefer the grand , gilded and clothbound British Defence Equipment Catalogue in three volumes ( 5,000 printed , $150 per set ) or France 's more workaday , four-volume paperback catalogue ( 6,000 printed , free ) , arsenal shoppers can find everything they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The British catalogue is a self-described " quick and easy reference . " Choosing is made quicker and easier by rating symbols : a land mine , for instance , can bear the mark of the Queen 's Award for outstanding technological achievement . <P> The perspective is international : " To our many Mends we apologise that this Catalogue is printed only in English ... Assistance can always be obtained from British Embassies . " <P> The small BAC 167 Strikemaster jet fighter , for example , " is now in service with twelve air forces throughout the world " and " offers a uniquely cost-effective solution for counter-insurgency . " Is the client 's country a bit underdeveloped ? No problem : Strikemaster " has proved its ability to operate ... under actual combat conditions from primitive airstrips . " The insurgents themselves might be interested in some of the wares . For example , the Blowpipe is a 44-lb. antiaircraft missile system that can be fired by a lone attacker . On one page is a " cratering kit , " designed to blow 25-ft. - wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matting ( installable by " completely unskilled labor " ) is for sale . <P> Britannia once ruled the waves ; today its customers can make the attempt . A whole navy is available off the peg : <P> there are 200-ft. - long " fast patrol boats , " destroyers , **30;9669;TOOLONG minesweepers , troop-carrying Hovercraft and even a 670-ft. , 14,000-ton Vickers aircraft carrier . Nor is the infantry slighted : there are mortars ( 51 mm or 81 mm ) , silencer-equipped submachine guns , four-round sniper rifles ( 99% accuracy at 400 meters ) and a battery-powered grenade launcher . Missiles ? Try an air-to-air Sky Flash or a ship-to-air Seawolf , a Rapier ( " low cost " and " low weight " ) or a Swingfire ( " long-range " and " antitank " ) . Once the weapons are ordered , there are British firms that will train troops and commanders , plan communications systems and even help manage bases .
