Scot Thompson stuck his head in the Cubs ' locker room before Wednesday ' s game to say hello to his former teammates . Later , as a pinch-hitter for the Montreal Expos , Thompson stuck his bat in front of a Lary Sorensen pitch to say goodbye to the Cubs . The Expos survived Ron Cey ' s grand-slam and came from four runs behind to beat the Cubs 8-7 . Thompson drove in what proved to be the winning run in the seventh inning at Wrigley Field and sent the Cubs to their ninth loss in 10 games . " I still have a lot of good friends on the Cubs and a lot of good memories , " Thompson said . " There were a lot of good times when I was in Chicago and some bad times , too . But overall my memories are fond ones . " Thompson has three hits in five at-bats as a pinch-hitter since he was traded from San Francisco , where he was 3-for-39 in the same role . " A lot of times when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something in the bottom of the ninth with two outs , " Thompson said . " It was real hard to get motivated . I tried to do some things I couldn ' t do . I tried to hit some home runs and that ' s just not my game . " I ' ve been used really well here . This is the first time I ' ve ever been with a club that has been above fifth place . It ' s a lot of fun . " Bryn Smith ( 14-4 ) allowed the Cubs six runs on seven hits . Tim Burke pitched the final three innings for his fifth save . Smith and catcher Sal Butera hit back-to-back homers in the Expos ' four-run fourth inning against Cubs ' starter Ray Fontenot . The homers were Smith ' s and Butera ' s first in the majors . " This was a strange game , but you always play strange games here , " said Smith , who is 4-0 against the Cubs this season . Each team scored an unearned run in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-for-5 , lined a single to center . Fontenot balked him to second . Hubie Brooks , who was 3-for-5 , reached on an infield single , then Tim Wallach hit a grounder to Cey at third . He bobbled the ball , then threw late to first for an error , allowing Dawson to score . In the Cubs ' first , Billy Hatcher singled off Vance Law ' s glove at first . Smith threw wildly to first on a pickoff attempt , sending Hatcher to third . Keith Moreland surprised the Expos with a two-out bunt single that drove in Hatcher . All four runs on Cey ' s grand slam in the third were unearned . Fontenot reached on Brooks ' error at shortstop . Davey Lopes drove a double to the wall then Moreland walked on four pitches to load the bases with two outs . Cey worked the count to 3-2 , fouled off four pitches then Cey drove the ball into the bleachers . " Smith seemed to be taking a little bit off his fastball each time , " Cey said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front too soon . It ' s always tough to get a hit with two outs against a guy who has pitched as well as he has this year . " It was Cey ' s 14th homer of the season and his seventh major-league slam . He has hit two homers since June 14 . " The idea of a guy hitting the ball like that has got to make Cey feel better , " Frey said . " He ' s been in a drought and he picked up a big hit at a time when it looked like it could be the difference in the ballgame . Hopefully , he ' ll benefit from that . " The Expos wasted no time tying the game . They scored four runs with two outs in the fourth , the first two runs on the homers by Butera and Smith . " I didn ' t even take batting practice today . I never take batting practice on days that I ' m going to pitch , " Smith said . " You can call it a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ' s been a long time since I ' ve practiced my home run trot . " After the homers , Tim Raines had an infield single and U.L. Washington walked . Dawson singled to drive in Raines and Brooks singled in Washington . " We had two outs and nobody on and our eighth and ninth hitters at bat , and we come up with a four-run inning , " said Expos ' manager Buck Rodgers . " We have enough balance in the lineup to keep coming back . " " Fontenot ' s strength is to throw a sinking fast ball and keep the ball down and away , " Frey said . " That was one of the few big innings we ' ve had and we couldn ' t hold it for more than five minutes . " The Expos took the lead 6-5 against Sorensen in the fifth . Rookie Mitch Webster hit his fifth home run of the season into the right-field seats . Moreland tied the game 6-6 with a two-out homer in the bottom of the fifth , his 10th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take an 8-6 lead . With two outs , Wallach swung and missed a third strike , but catcher Jody Davis was charged with a passed ball that let Wallach reach first .
