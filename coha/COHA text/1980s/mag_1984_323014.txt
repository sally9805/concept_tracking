The new Prime Minister offers assurances to U.S. investors <P> The message was clear . " Canada is open for business again , " said Brian Mulroney . His audience , 1,450 U.S. executives and their guests at an Economic Club of New York dinner in Manhattan 's Hilton Hotel , evidently liked what they heard : they gave Canada 's new Prime Minister two standing ovations . Mulroney , 45 , vowed that his government would be " there to assist and not to harass the private sector in creating new wealth and the new jobs that Canada needs . " <P> In the minds of many U.S. businessmen , that would be quite an improvement . Under former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , whose Liberal Party held power for 20 of the past 21 years , the government bowed to surges of economic nationalism and adopted policies that sometimes made U.S. investors feel unwelcome . Mulroney 's Progressive Conservative Party won a landslide victory over the Liberals after campaigning , among other issues , against a number of Trudeau-era restrictions on foreign investment . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. since taking office , indicated that the Prune Minister intends to make good on his promises . Said he : " Our government has embarked on a fundamental change in our economic direction . " <P> That change comes as Canada struggles to climb back from its most severe recession since World War II . From mid-1981 to late 1982 , an estimated 550,000 people lost their jobs , and the unemployment rate rose from 6.8% to 12.8% : Despite two years of modest improvement , employment has still not returned to prerecession levels . Canadian industry continues to operate substantially below capacity . Said Mulroney last week : " My government considers the creation of jobs its top priority . It is , for us , a moral imperative . " <P> A key part of that strategy is to encourage foreigners to build new plants and expand existing ones in Canada . To that end , Mulroney has announced his intention to close down Canada 's decade-old Foreign Investment Review Agency , which screened all new foreign investments . In its place , he is creating Investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister 's words , " encourage and facilitate investment . " Like its predecessor , however , Investment Canada will have the right to review potential foreign entrants into businesses deemed important to Canada 's cultural heritage and national identity . Most direct takeovers of existing Canadian businesses whose assets exceed $3.8 million will still be eligible for review . <P> <P> Mulroney said he also plans to alter the controversial " back-In " provision of the 1980 National Energy Program . The rule stipulates that the Canadian government is entitled to 25% of any successful offshore oil discovery by a foreign firm . The party 's position during the campaign last summer was to exact the same share as before , but turn it over to private Canadian companies willing to pay for the share instead of having the government keep it . From the point of view of U.S. firms , that still means an off-putting surrender of a quarter of any new discovery .
