The first of every year is often marked by fresh resolutions , but last week China 's government workers experienced an especially bracing change . Instead of the traditional two-hour lunch break , which usually allowed time for a nap , they were permitted only an hour off . Though the cutback had been announced in advance , it still proved a rude jolt . Workers who were accustomed to cycling home for lunch found themselves forced to eat near their jobs ; since few offices have canteens , employees jammed into crowded restaurants cursed with slow service . Schoolteachers in Canton even asked their supervisors for a &lt; return to the two-hour recess to give students enough time for a meal at home . <P> So began the first week of 1985 for the world 's most populous nation . Six years after Deng Xiaoping , in an attempt to shape China into a powerful , modern nation , introduced some of the most daring and far-reaching reforms ever attempted in a Communist country , the winds of change are blowing as strongly as ever . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to imprint his notion of what China should be upon the country before he dies . However , unlike Mao , an eternal revolutionary , Deng is a shrewd pragmatist whose economic reforms have proved popular , at least so far , among a people eager for Western-style prosperity . His policies , aimed at transforming a centrally planned economy into one that is more market-oriented , have not been greeted with approval by hard-liners among party and army officials , who suspect their positions are eroding . Deng is moving , cautiously but firmly , to weed out some of his stauncher critics : only two weeks ago , 40 senior military officers were forced into retirement . " I am afraid that some of our old comrades have this fear : after a generation of socialism and Communism , it is unacceptable to spout some capitalism , " said Deng in a speech published in the Chinese press on New Year 's Day . " It can not harm us . It can not harm us . " <P> Deng actually delivered those remarks at the October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist Party 's elder statesmen , but the full text had not been published before . In what was clearly a dramatic effort to give the reform movement even greater momentum , the country 's press carried the speech on front pages . " No country can now develop by closing its door , " said Deng , in a spirited defense of his policy of building ties to the West . " We suffered from this , and our forefathers suffered from this . Isolation landed China in poverty , backwardness and ignorance . " Only by means of foreign investment and trade , Deng said , could China achieve a paramount goal : to quadruple its gross national product to $1 trillion by the year 2000.
