Mr. Stevens is not an eminent culinary scholar , yet his zany observations about food and other topics are well known to those who follow cartoons in The New Yorker magazine . One of his recent drawings shows a dinner plate holding a crumpled creation described in the caption as : " A mystery wrapped in an enigma , served on a bed of lettuce . " Another , depicting a " Mrs. Coffee " machine , shows a businessman , briefcase in hand , dashing out of the house to work . The machine admonishes , " A cup of coffee - you call that breakfast ? " // Mr. Stevens takes the train to New York from his home in New Haven every Wednesday morning to submit a dozen or so cartoons and , as he said , " to pick up the rejected ones " from The New Yorker ' s art editor , Lee Lorenz. // For the past 10 years , Mr. Stevens has eaten lunch every week with a jocular group of fellow cartoonists : the cast of characters expands and contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven generally remains the same. // This updated New Yorker round table eschews the celebrated dining room at the Algonquin Hotel and instead frequents casual ( and less expensive ) spots like Kenny ' s Steak Pub on Lexington Avenue at 50th Street , where , Mr. Stevens observes , " There is never a celebrity in sight , and the background music comes from a radio " ; the Quiet Man , 40 West 45th Street , " which is so quiet we never have trouble getting reservations for seven at the last minute " ; and Cavanagh ' s , at Broadway and 40th Street , where the eggs Benedict garnished with halved black olives " look like something out of an old Japanese monster movie. " // At Cavanagh ' s one recent Wednesday Mr. Stevens was joined by a reporter and six other cartoonists : Jack Ziegler , who lives in New Milford , Conn . ; Richard Cline , Roz Chast and Robert Mankoff , all New Yorkers ; and a recently married cartooning couple , Michael Maslin and Liza Donnelly from Rhinebeck , N.Y. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stevens ' s case , a vodka and Coke ( " It ' s the drink of the 90 ' s ; you ' ll be seeing a lot of it , " he predicted ) , the group pondered such questions as food as a social parody , restaurants as a microcosm of life and which is better at Cavanagh ' s , the shrimp salad or hamburger . Mr. Mankoff noted that in recent years " the faddishness of food " has made the gastronomic scene fertile fodder for humor . There is also a pragmatic reason why so many cartoons take place in restaurants. // " A lot of our cartoons are dialogue , " Mr. Cline said . " And you ' ve got to put these people somewhere . Restaurants are more jovial than endless situations with couples sitting on sofas and exchanging jaded comments. " // To which Mr. Stevens added , " And you also don ' t have to draw their legs. " // Mr. Cline , whose drawings often depict a jaded , relentlessly urbane couple trading acerbic remarks , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " People here are always in restaurants , they go to talk about their lives ; they talk about everything , " he said . " There is really nothing people don ' t talk about in restaurants . " A recent Cline cartoon depicted a couple sitting in a restaurant about to order a meal , and the man saying , " Bill , would you mind if I call you waiter ? " // Aside from their quick wits and skewed perspectives on the world , these artists seem to have little in common. // Mr. Ziegler , a big , ursine fellow with a gray beard and warm smile , worked as an information processor for television news before selling his first cartoon to The New Yorker , " after about 600 tries , " he said . Mr. Cline restored old homes . Mr. Mankoff describes himself as a former " quasi psychologist . " Mr. Stevens held odd jobs on both coasts , including stockroom clerk and chauffeur . Ms. Chast studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design . Ms. Donnelly worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Only Mr. Maslin has pursued his drawing career uninterrupted. // Trying to get a cartoonist to describe the creative process of humor is sort of like asking a hockey goalie why he likes being a target for 100-mile-an-hour projectiles. // " I don ' t remember , " replied Mr. Maslin , asked about the inspiration behind recent food-related cartoons . Mr. Ziegler just shook his head . Ms. Chast was hardly more forthcoming when asked about the genesis of a drawing that has one of her frail , befuddled characters sitting at a lunch counter in front of a big bowl of salad greens . The caption read : " THE END OF AN ERA : MAY 10 , 1987 : Bean Sprouts Begin to Taste Weird . " " I never really liked sprouts , " she said. // Mr. Stevens , who carries a tape recorder in his pickup truck to record flashes of inspiration ( " But I rarely use it " ) , calls the process akin to an auto accident : " When it ' s over , you don ' t remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating shows a lunch counter filled with dozing customers , titled " The Decafe. " // " I was drinking a lot of coffee at the time and thinking about decaf , " he said . " It was the line that came first . I was thinking about what people would be like if they drank decaf coffee all day. " // Most professional cartoonists get unsolicited suggestions from gag writers and readers , but in the end their ideas come in unpredictable ways - " unless we steal them from each other , " Mr. Mankoff said . Sometimes they copy from themselves without realizing it . Mr. Stevens recalled submitting a cartoon to The New Yorker , having it accepted and receiving a check for it . " One day Lee Lorenz called me over and said , ' Look at this . ' There were practically identical cartoons , one I had done a few years before . Neither of us had caught it. " // Most of the cartoonists expressed satisfaction with Cavanaugh ' s straightforward pub fare ( burgers , eggs , salads and grilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of lunch digging around in her bowl of ravioli and rearranging them to appear partially consumed . " Roz , you ' re not eating , you ' re prospecting , " Mr. Mankoff said . This relatively undemanding group of gastronomes agreed that hamburgers were the chef ' s strong card. // The cartoonists , all of whom lead solitary work lives at drawing tables , say their weekly lunches are their only social contacts with colleagues. // " I look forward to this little trip every week , " Mr. Stevens said , sipping the last of his vodka and Coke . " You could send your stuff in by mail , I suppose , but rejection is so much nicer in person. " //
