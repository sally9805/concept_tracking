Actors are always talking about writing themselves a juicy part . But when Academy Award Winner George Kennedy , 58 ( Cool Hand Luke ) , actually sat down to do a book , he left no doubt as to who would be the obvious choice to play the main character . In Murder on Location , a hard-boiled tale of Hollywood low jinks , the sleuthing hero is an actor , just like George , a private pilot , just like George , and is named-you guessed it-George Kennedy . Avon books has run off 185,000 paperback copies and the film rights have already been snapped up . As for the plot , well , the book jacket copy says it all : " Lights ! Camera ! Murder ! The picture had box-office bucks written all over it . Top talent , a big budget and a great script . Until someone on the set started changing the story line to murder . " Maybe it will all lead to a sequel , say , a psychological thriller about an actor-pilot-writer who while playing himself becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his private persona vanishes forever . <P> <P> " He 's our modern-day version of the great heroes who appeared from time to time throughout history , " said President Ronald Reagan . " There were many like him in the past-pioneers , soldiers , lawmen , explorers-people who all went out and put their lives on the line for the cause of good . " Whom did he mean ? An astronaut , perhaps , or a star FBI drug buster . No , Reagan was praising Agent 007 in a filmed appearance on a British TV special , James Bond , The First 21 Years . The President did not seem troubled by the fact that Ian Fleming 's superspy also has a reputation for booze ( vodka martinis , shaken not stirred ) , fast women and a quick trigger-not precisely dear-to-the-heartland pulpit pleasers . White House embarrassment did not develop , however , until a Washington , B.C. , TV station , which had picked up the program , began using the President 's words for 30-second promo spots . The program went on as scheduled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectively canceling double R I 's license to shill . <P> <P> " The thrill of a lifetime , " proclaimed Vice President George Bush , 59 , after he and five-time Wimbledon Winner Bjorn Borg , 27 , came from behind in a friendly but hard-fought game of doubles at Stockholm 's Royal Tennis Hall to defeat Sweden 's former Davis Cup Star Jan-Erik Lundquist , 46 , and the country 's Ambassador to Washington , Wilhelm Wachtmeister , 60 , 3-6 , 6-1 , 6-3 . The winning team 's post-mort opinions of each other 's play reflected the differing strengths of their diplomatic strokes . " I think he played very well , " said Borg of Bush 's flashy net game and a serve that was sometimes hot , sometimes not . Of Borg , Bush bubbled , " Fantastic . Anybody that can carry me has got to be good . " <P>
