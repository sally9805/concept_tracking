Consumer advocacy groups have taken their case to the regulators , politicians and judges , arguing that tens of thousands of women have developed harmful complications from the surgery to increase breast size or reconstruct a breast after a mastectomy . The complications include hard breasts , the need for repeated operations and swollen lymph glands. // Surgeons say the procedure is safe and effective . Moreover , they say most of the two million American women who have had breast implants are happy with them . The complications are reversible and not life-threatening , the surgeons say. // // Lack of Data Cited // " The problem is that no one has any good data , " said Dr. Genevieve Matanoski , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who is serving on an F.D.A. committee studying breast implants . " We don ' t know how many women experience complications . Some women say they have a better life , and others report horror stories . The doctors say they see few complications , but they may not be following patients who get into trouble. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Dr. Matanoski said , adding , " The best we can do is give stronger warnings. " // Both sides agree the debate is often more emotional than factual . The issue taps deeply held beliefs about body image , and personal choice. // At the Food and Drug Administration , which is charged with regulating the safety of the materials that are implanted , several committees have begun to debate the safety questions . Last year the agency issued a ruling that requires all manufacturers to provide , for the first time , scientific data demonstrating the safety of the implants . But the compliance deadline is more than two years away . <> <> Maryland Booklet Planned // Several states , including Maryland , Kentucky and California , have considered laws requiring more warnings for women seeking implant surgery , said Joan Pitkin , a Maryland legislator . In most states , physicians have successfully lobbied against such measures , she said . But two years ago Maryland passed a law requiring a booklet on the risks of breast surgery . ( The pamphlets are available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hygiene , Division of Cancer Control , 201 West Preston Street , Baltimore , Md. 21201 . ) The matter has reached the courts in patients ' lawsuits against surgeons . Sidney Wolfe , director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a consumer advocacy group in Washington , says about 200 such cases have been brought. // The F.D.A. " does not believe that there is cause for alarm at present about the safety of silicone breast implants , " said John C. Villforth , director of the agency ' s Center for Devices and Radiological Health . " But answers are needed to establish once and for all just what the risks are. " // The implants were first used in the 1960 ' s , before the F.D.A. had a mandate to regulate them . In 1976 the agency was directed to regulate medical devices , but it is only now beginning to study implants . Other devices , like heart valves , were considered to be more important targets of regulation , agency officials said . <> <> Costs Range Up to $4 , 000 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , 15 percent of them to replace breast tissue removed after cancer surgery and the rest simply to augment their breast size . The implants are essentially elastic bags filled with silicone gel or saltwater . About 10 models are sold , including one covered with polyurethane foam . Each operation costs from $2 , 000 to $4 , 000 , surgical societies say. // The benefits of breast implant surgery are primarily psychological . Many women are intensely self-conscious about being flat-chested , said Dr. Marcia Goin , a psychiatrist at the University of Southern California . Other women are devastated by a mastectomy , she said . A breast implant makes them feel whole. // From the surgeon ' s perspective , " breast augmentation and reconstructions represent some of the happiest patients we ever see , " said Dr. William Shaw , chairman of plastic surgery at the University of California at Los Angeles. // " You can not help but share in their joy and happiness , " he added . " An unlucky 5 percent may have problems , but by and large the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choose // Dr. T. Roderick Hester , a plastic surgeon at the Emory Clinic in Atlanta , complained that consumer groups want to take choice away from women . " They wonder , ' Why can ' t a woman accept herself the way she is , and why do her breasts have to matter so much ? ' " he said . " The only answer to that is , they do matter. " // Surgeons say that the complications associated with breast implant surgery are relatively easy to observe and are not unexpected. // The most common side effect is capsular contracture . Whenever a foreign material is implanted under the skin , the body responds by attempting to wall off the invading material . This wall of scar tissue , called a capsule , usually stays soft and pliable . But in some people , for reasons not understood , the capsule contracts tightly around the implant . <> <> Incidence of Contracture // The medical literature on breast implants reports that up to 75 percent of all women experience some degree of capsular contracture . A smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe contracture . Their breasts become hard and painful. // Women are told to massage their breasts three or four times a day after implant surgery to keep scar tissue from hardening , said Sibyl Goldrich , an assistant literary agent in Los Angeles who suffered from the complication. // " But it doesn ' t work for everybody , " she said . " You can ' t sleep on your stomach , and you don ' t have full mobility of your arms. " // Surgeons have tried to reduce this complication by altering the position of implants , putting them behind chest wall muscles instead of behind glandular breast tissue. // In severe cases , doctors may choose to reopen the breasts through the old scar , remove the implant , scrape out the scar tissue and insert another implant . <> <> ' Every Kind of Implant ' // Ms. Goldrich , who underwent eight implants in five operations after a double mastectomy in 1983 , said , " I had every kind of implant , and none worked . " She had contractures , infection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resorted to a complicated technique in which doctors fashion breasts out of abdominal tissue. // Dr. Shaw says one of every five women who has breast implants will need repeat surgery for a variety of reasons , including painful capsular contracture , assymmetry , infection , blood clots and implant rupture. // When implants rupture , large amounts of silicone can be released into the chest . In that case the surgeon removes the implants , scrapes out as much silicone as possible and inserts a new set of implants if the patient wants them . Usually , they do. // All gel-filled implants leak tiny amounts of silicone over the years . By one estimate , the amount is less than a quarter of a drop over many years . The substance migrates to lymph nodes and eventually enters the blood stream. // Surgeons say the silicone is harmless , although there is no evidence to prove that . Consumer groups say the effects are not known . <> <> Some Allergic Reactions // Some women develop allergic reactions to silicone , including swollen joints and scleroderma , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardens. // Escaped silicone " appears to be closely associated with chronic inflammatory reaction , " researchers from the University of Pennsylvania said in a recent issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. // There is also a question about whether the implants can cause or stimulate cancer in humans. // In a study of rodents , 23 percent of those exposed to silicone gel developed cancer . The study was released last year by the Dow Corning Corporation , which makes silicone gel and is associated with Corning Inc. and the Dow Chemical Company. // But , in a recent assessment of that study , the F.D.A. concluded that the results probably do not apply to humans and that if a cancer risk exists for women it probably is small . <> <> White Shadows on Mammogram // Breast implants can interfere with routine mammography to detect cancer , however . Implants turn up as white shadows , like bone , on the mammogram , said Dr. Judy M. Destouet of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology in St Louis. // Proponents of the surgery say that if thousands of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to complain ? // Dr. Shaw , the U.C.L.A. surgeon , maintains that few people are being hurt . " If implants caused life-threatening problems , " he said , " we would know by now. " // But Gail Donleavy , a New York City lawyer who represents implant patients , says many women who are hurt are reluctant to press lawsuits . When the implant fails , she said , they feel ashamed and blame themselves. // " We need more women to come forward and tell their stories , " said Esther Rome of the Boston Women ' s Health Book Collective . " Otherwise , surgeons can say , ' Oh yes , that can happen , but not to my patients. ' " //
