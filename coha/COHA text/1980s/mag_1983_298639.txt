Pinochet brings out his troops to grapple with rising dissent <P> It was the fourth , and bloodiest by far , in a series of monthly protests that had already led to nine deaths . Attempting to enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew last Thursday , 18,000 troops and police battled hundreds of angry Chilean youths in the streets , while thousands of householders leaned from their windows banging pots and pans in a now familiar ritual of protest against the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . When the fighting ceased , 26 civilians , including three children , were dead , more than 100 were wounded by gunfire and an estimated 1,000 were arrested . In the aftermath , Major General Osvaldo Hernandez claimed his troops had been attacked by " subversives . " <P> Not so , said Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Fernando Matthei . In what looked like a possible crack in the military monolith supporting Pinochet , Matthei claimed that " at no moment were there clashes in the neighborhoods that I visited . " Almost simultaneously , retired Army General Roberto Viaux Marambio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued an open protest against the government crackdown . " I do not want to keep silent lest it imply complicity , " said Viaux . " The armed forces have been employed to repress the call of national protest . " The signs of dissension in the military came after a week of mounting civilian pressure on Pinochet to resign . <P> The previous Saturday , at Santiago 's Circulo Espaol , the city 's largest club , an overflow crowd of 1,500 gathered , ostensibly to honor Christian Democratic Party President Gabriel Valds . A former Foreign Minister under President Eduardo Frei , Valds , 63 , used the occasion to unveil a new coalition of Chile 's five main parties , excluding the Communists . Calling itself the Democratic Alliance , the group demanded that Pinochet give way to a provisional government leading to elections within 18 months . <P> The mere fact that 1,500 politicians and their supporters had assembled safely in the same room was an event in itself . Officially , political parties are still banned ; until a few months ago , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractious opposition , Valds hoped to convince Pinochet that the alliance offered a valid alternative to a nation staggered with debt and unemployment and locked in an often brutal cycle of protest and repression . <P> With Valds calling for dialogue , the stage was now set for the government 's response . It came four days later , when Pinochet , 67 , stood wearily at attention in La Moneda Palace to the recorded strains of Chile 's national anthem . The stocky , graying dictator stared impassively at the ceiling as the names of seven new Cabinet ministers were announced . The ceremony at first appeared depressingly familiar : it was the fifth Cabinet shuffle within 16 months , the 33rd in the decade since Pinochet seized power .
