Everyone knows that Chrysler , International Harvester and Braniff International could be headed for the corporate scrap heap . But could you believe the same about General Motors , Sears , RCA , General Dynamics , Burroughs , Goodyear and Dow Chemical ? Well , Martin Weiss , a bearded 34-year-old investment adviser and money manager , does . And , he contends , the seven companies just mentioned - plus 13 other corporate biggies - are all candidates for the bankruptcy ranks . Weiss puts out a biweekly investment letter , Money Forecasts , in West Palm Beach , Fla. , that focuses on interest rates and the money and credit markets . It numbers about 10,000 subscribers . He made a lot of financial waves last year with his book , " The Great Money Panic " , which forecasts an explosive demand for " unavailable " cash . Weiss ' s views merit a respectful airing . For starters , he told me the next issue of Money Forecasts ( out Jan. 15 ) will contain a chart of the 20 major blue chips ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on analysis of balance sheets , recent earnings trends and current sales patterns in their basic businesses . The 20 will be in two groups - the 10 most vulnerable now and 10 that could be headed for problems later . The 10 with current problems , as he sees them : Deere , Dow Chemical , General Telephone , Georgia-Pacific , Goodyear , Inco , IT &T,; RCA , Tenneco andTextron . The 10 with potential problems down the road : Armco , Burroughs , Commonwealth Edison , Eastern Air Lines , General Dynamics , General Motors , NCR , National Steel , Sears and United Brands . In most cases , these are companies , observes Weiss , that expanded on a " gung-ho " philosophy of great times ahead and in the process amassed huge debt at high interest cost . Granted , sales and earnings did increase - but debt ballooned at a much faster pace , a lot of it at high rates . He notes , for example , that Textron , some five years ago , had 23.5 cents on hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the latest figures show only 1.8 cents on hand to cover each buck of such owings . In the same period , using the same financial criteria , General Telephonewent from 10.1 to 4.1 cents ; United Brands , from 36.9 to 8.3 cents ; Tenneco , from 7.7 to a paltry 1.6 cents ; Eastern Air Lines , from 35.2 to 18 cents and General Motors , 30.5 to 7.8 cents . Weiss acknowledges the argument of many corporate financial watchers that in today ' s modern economy - given the sophisticated cash management systems - you don ' t need as much cash around as in the old days . He says , however , that this view essentially assumes that any recession will not be steep or deep , that the Federal Reserve will be able to hold down interest rates ( and therefore the interest costs of corporations will be held down ) and , most important , that more credit will always be available to roll over debts coming due . But these assumptions , as Weiss sees it , no longer hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsing , diminishing this significant source of credit ; the Fed is neither willing nor able to pump up the money supply or hold interest rates down because of the danger of more inflation ; and the impending economic decline will be far more severe than expectedbecause of government spending cutbacks , slow money growth and huge federal deficits , which , in turn , will force rates higher and spur further government spending reductions . Even allowing for the serious cash-shortage thesis that Weiss advances , it nonetheless seems incredulous to believe that companies like GM and Sears could go under . GM , he says , despite massive increases in debt - from $23.5 billion in 1976 to $41 billion currently - has gone from over $10 a share in earnings to the red . It has done too little too late to cut back on its massive expansion program and it ' s highly dependent on credit buying . And no easy credit means no easy sales . Turning to Sears , Weiss says the retail giant is one of the major issuers of short-term commercial paper ( corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow regularly . But if you have a bankruptcy scare in this country , raising the specter of defaults on commercial paper , in effect you could close down the bulk of this vital credit market . And this , adds Weiss , would make it very difficult for Sears to roll over its commercial paper coming due . Weiss admits that many corporations have a potential " out " - namely , the sale of some assets to raise needed cash . But even here , he concludes , " we could be talking of little more than a temporary Band-aid if the going really gets rough . "
