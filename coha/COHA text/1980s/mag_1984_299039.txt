Or should we create an event called the embarrathon ? No outright boycotts permitted , but somewhere on the regular schedule of every Olympics would be an occasion for any participating nation to needle or humiliate any other nation . Medals would be presented , as in the athletic events , but in the embarrathon both winners and losers would be asked to mount the platforms so that the world might jeer or smirk as it chose . Or are we getting desperate ? <P> It may be heartening to point out that in the long and murky history of the Games things have looked considerably bleaker . For centuries after their founding , write John Kieran and Arthur Daley in The Story of the Olympic Games , the Olympics provided " the great peaceful events of civilization . " Yet eventually , as Greece gave way to Rome , " they lost the spirit of the older days . Winners were no longer contented with a simple olive wreath as a prize . They sought gifts and money . Heartened yet ? The games , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circuses . " Halted by the Roman Emperor Theodosius in A.D. 393 , they did not resume until 1896 , in which hiatus the world spun reasonably well without them . <P> Now , the question of the day seems to be : Where do we go from here ? There is no fixed agreement . Many suggest that for the Olympics to survive their geopolitical wars , there should be a ) a single permanent site ( Greece seems the favorite ) , and b ) a denationalizing of the events ( no flags , anthems or colors ; just individual names ) . If nations are serious about mucking up the Games , however , a single site would not deter them . No permanent location would prevent an act of terrorism such as made a tragedy of Munich in 1972 . And if the will is there , an individual name can take on the magnitude or onus of a nation . <P> But the more sensible question may be : Why should the Games continue at all ? After last week 's announcements that the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most American commentators sounded fed up with the whole business . Perhaps justifiably . Since 1968 every Olympics has been spoiled by some act of political protest or violence , and during that same period the Games have grown gargantuan in size , stakes and influence . Until the Soviet decision , it was estimated that this year a television audience of 2 billion people would watch the events , " more than half the living , breathing people on earth , " as Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee President Peter Ueberroth once described the crowd . <P> Politics dogs power . In part the Soviet pullout appears to be a getting-even with Jimmy Carter 's 1980 boycott after the invasion of Afghanistan . But since the Soviets were always intent on showing their displeasure with Ronald Reagan , they could have chosen no better theater . <P> Then there are the dollars , billions of them as well . When athletes who are supposedly amateurs stand to make fortunes in a pole vault , winning and profit become the same thing . Soon ends justify means . Soon other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are reinforced . Soon everything is spoiled .
