" Throughout 1935 Vivien continued her lonely pursuit of her husband . It seems to have been her settled conviction that she had only to see and to speak to him , and he would agree to return to her . And , in November , she found him . She had discovered that he was to deliver an address at a Sunday Times book exhibition , and she arrived there ... This was the confrontation Eliot most feared . Vivien went up to him and said , ' Oh , Tom ' ; he seized her hand and said ' How do you do ' in a loud voice . The dog recognized him and jumped up at him , but he seemed not to notice . When he spoke at the exhibition , Vivien stood the whole time , keeping her eyes fixed upon his face . After he had finished his address she went up to him again and said , ' Will you come back with me ? ' He replied , ' I can not talk to you now ' . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other again .
