The words were inflammatory , but the audience took them in stride . Referring to the discredited era of Leonid Brezhnev , who died in 1982 , Vladimir I. Melnikov , an obscure official from the Russian republic , declared from the podium at the 19th All-Union Communist Party Conference , " People who in previous times actively conducted the policy of stagnation can not now be on , or work in , central party or Soviet organs in the period of restructuring . " <P> To most people in the auditorium , Melnikov 's meaning was clear . But Mikhail Gorbachev wanted him to be even more explicit . Breaking into the speech , Gorbachev asked , " Maybe you have some concrete suggestions ? " Then , explaining to other delegates , Gorbachev added with a smile , " We 're sitting here and do n't know : Is he talking about me or somebody else ? " Melnikov proceeded to do what would have been unthinkable even a few months ago , naming names  --  and prominent ones at that , including Andrei Gromyko , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorbachev 's face , but when the highlights of the session were played on Soviet television later in the evening , that remarkable exchange was not deleted . <P> So it went last week at the first , extraordinary party gathering since 1941 , an event that proved extraordinary in every sense of the word . Day after sweltering day in an early summer heat wave , nearly 5,000 delegates met in the Kremlin 's vast Palace of Congresses to debate their country 's political future , and specifically the fate of Gorbachev 's three-year-old program of perestroika ( restructuring ) . A combination political convention , town meeting , classroom lecture and gripe session , the gathering turned into an astonishing exercise in Gorbachev 's second-favorite buzz word , glasnost ( openness ) . More than 70 delegates spoke their minds by week 's end , and many others wanted to do so . But Gorbachev finally cut short discussion to hold a series of votes on political reforms . He got pretty much everything he asked for , including a new presidential system of government in which he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head of state . <P> Whether or not the conference succeeded in making Gorbachev 's modernization plans " irreversible "  --  his stated goal  --  there was little doubt that he dominated the event . The Soviet leader delivered three addresses , including a 3 1/2-hr. keynote speech and an impassioned follow-up talk starkly warning that socialism " will die unless we reform the political system . " He also delivered the meeting 's closing address , declaring that the conference had opened the way to " a democratic image of socialism . " <P> As if that were not enough , Gorbachev repeatedly interrupted other delegates as they spoke , usually to endorse their pro-reform assertions . The General Secretary even provided some moments of comic relief . After Politburo Member Alexander Yakovlev read a note asking delegates to refrain from delivering self-serving accounts of local party activities , Gorbachev leaned back in his chair and deadpanned , " That has the support of the conference , right ?
