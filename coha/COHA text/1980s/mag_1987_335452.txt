* It should not be said that Arnaud de Borchgrave never sleeps . True , he puts in 18-hour days at the Washington Times , showering his staff with " Arnaud- grams , " notes scrawled on yellow paper suggesting stories and sources . He bounces around the newsroom , nagging , second-guessing or just plain giving orders . But he does sleep . The proof is in his office , which contains a queen- size bed . Though de Borchgrave owns an apartment in Washington , he spends many nights at work , rising before dawn to read the day 's papers . <P> Such industriousness has been a boon for the troubled Times , the conservative newspaper owned by a group of Korean investors affiliated with the Rev. Sun Myung Moon 's Unification Church . Founded in 1982 as an alternative to what the Times has called the " town 's 800-pound gorilla , " the mighty  --  and liberal  --  Washington Post , the five-day-a-week paper has not entirely erased its image as a " Moonie " sheet tainted by its owners ' politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the capital 's most powerful breakfast tables , and is among the few newspapers that are regularly excerpted for Ronald Reagan 's daily news briefing book . Chief of Staff Howard Baker has noted that both the Times and the Washington Post are " required reading " at the White House , joking that " one of them is read for the news and the other for Art Buchwald . " <P> Most days , of course , the 230 reporters and editors at the Times ( circ. 104,000 ) are no match for the 450-strong Post ( circ. 796,000 ) , but the paper , the only local alternative to the Post , has had a few impressive scoops . The Times broke the story alleging that Michael Deaver had improperly used his White House ties to advance his lobbying business and , two months ago , revealed Mobil Oil 's decision to move its headquarters from Manhattan to suburban Washington . Though the Times has serious weaknesses ( its national political coverage is abysmally shallow , for example ) , its strengths include a scrappy metropolitan staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for a publication its size . " The paper you see now is not the paper we saw five years ago , " says Press Critic Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution . <P> Much of the credit belongs to de Borchgrave , 60 , a Newsweek foreign correspondent for 29 years before joining the Times in 1985 . Sometimes de Borchgrave calls a wrong shot ( a Times exclusive that Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi had fled to Yemen remained exactly that : an exclusive ) , but overall , the editor rates highly with his staff . " He 's not an intellectual genius , but he 's incredibly passionate and energetic , " says David Brooks , who recently left the Times for the Wall Street Journal .
