NOTEBOOK THE P.L.O . ' S CENTRAL . COUNCIL met in Damascus and finally gave its answer to the Reagan plan . The answer is no . Those in the West who sympathize with the P.L.O . fervently wished it would give a hint of a willingness to recognize Israel . They were disappointed , again . We are neither disappointed nor surprised . As Henry Kissinger has recently pointed out , " in negotiations between Israel and the Arabs , the question of recognition plays a disproportionate and unprecedented role . In all other negotiations mutual recognition is assumed at the outset . I know no other negotiation in which a country is asked to accept recognition of its existence as the principal quid pro quo . " And recognition , he points out , " is not , when all is said , much of a concession for the P.L.O . to make . Many recognized states nevertheless wound up being destroyed even in our own time . " ' OPTION PAPERS ' do n't tell very much about policy , but they do tell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Thanksgiving Day , the mentality of the President 's economic policymakers was unmasked in an " option paper " presented to him about unemployment . Among the options was a tax on unemployment benefits . Of course there is a kind of grotesque logic to this . The Administration is desperate about its deficit . It must put a tax on something . Why not , therefore , put a tax on what it produces in greatest quantity ? unemployment ? The avowed aim of the " option " was to make unemployment " less attractive , " spoke White House spokesman Larry Speakes . This is of a piece with the Reaganomical concept of " incentives " : to make the rich work , provide money ; to make the poor work , take it away . " We do know , " said Edwin Meese , " that generally when unemployment benefits end , most people find jobs very quickly . ... " Not anymore , Mr. Meese . More than half of the nearly twelve million people out of work collect no benefits . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " attractive . " They believe that it is terrible . It damages their souls and leaves their families destitute . And now the Administration adds its insult to its injury . THE EXTENT OF HOLLYWOOD 'S interference with life was recently suggested by the alacrity with which the studios made themelves available to John DeLorean . And now Elizabeth Taylor , for decades Hollywood 's ambassadress to the world , and perhaps its most consummate creation , nakedly expresses the industry 's most profound feeling about a human life ? in a word , that it is a property . She is suing ABC to prevent it from making a " docu-drama " about her . " Miss Taylor 's first contention , " according to The New York Times , " is that her life story is a commercial property which she alone has the right to exploit . " Or , as she herself put it , " I am my own commodity . " That must be one of the most alienated sentences ever uttered by man or woman . It is a kind of epitaph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precise term for the condition of self-absorption in which movie stars are frequently found ; it is not vanity , it is commodity fetishism. 111 FORTY YEARS AGO IN THE NEW REPUBLIC : " In Casablanca , Humphrey Bogart 's humanitarian killer , who was disillusioned apparently at his mother 's breast , has to say some silly things and to play God too often to be as believably tough as he was in his last eight pictures . Yet the people in Hollywood do n't project their hokum without reason . They know very well the pleasure one gets from seeing Ingrid Bergman , so noble and utterly clear , Mr. Bogart 's mouth , which seems to be holding back a mouthful of blood , the contrast in villains of Veidt , Greenstreet and Lorre . If , as this is , it is from Warner 's , it is full of political intelligence . In addition there is an album of jazz classics , with a Negro ( Dooley Wilson ) singing them . Finally , there is one good sequence where intuitive feelings prevailed over script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene in which the fighting Frenchmen drown out the Germans ' ' Horst Wessel ' by singing their ' Marseillaise . ' Casablanca is as ineffectual as a Collier 's short story , but with one thing and another ? like Bergman , Veidt and Humphrey Bogart ? it is a pleasure of sorts . "
