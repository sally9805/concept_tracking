Twenty-three years after the fatal shots rang out in Dallas , questions about the assassination of John F. Kennedy still reverberate . The 1964 Warren Report concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald , acting alone , shot the President from the Texas School Book Depository . But 15 years later , the House Select Committee on Assassinations , while agreeing that Oswald was the murderer , decided he was most probably part of a conspiracy . Though some of the evidence leading to that finding has been discredited , conspiracy theories continue to proliferate , tracing the crime to everything from a Mafia cabal to the CIA . <P> Now an extraordinary television trial has tried to shed some light on the controversy . In On Trial : Lee Harvey Oswald , a two-part , 5 1/2-hour program that debuted on Showtime last weekend and will be repeated several times in upcoming weeks , the case against Oswald is argued for the first time in a courtroom setting under the rules of courtroom evidence . Real witnesses are examined by real attorneys , and the testimony is evaluated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polled on a separate question , the jury decided by a majority vote that Oswald was the sole assassin . <P> This unique experiment in reality programming was conceived by London Weekend Television , which staged a mock trial of Richard III for British TV in 1984 . Looking for another historical crime to " try " on TV , the producers turned to the Kennedy assassination . Unlike earlier fictional treatments like the 1977 ABC movie The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald , the program has no script and ( except for extras ) uses no actors . Two prominent attorneys were enlisted to argue the case . For the prosecution : Vincent Bugliosi , 52 , the former Los , Angeles deputy district attorney who prosecuted Charles Manson . For the defense : Gerry Spence , 57 , who successfully represented Karen Silkwood 's family in a suit against the Kerr-McGee Corp . Lucius Bunton , 61 , a U.S. district judge from Texas , was selected to preside , and a jury was chosen from the Dallas jury rolls . ( Oswald is represented by an empty chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-day taping , which resulted in 18 hours of testimony ; Showtime , the program 's co-producer , plans to air the full-length version next year . <P> The program 's research staff spent 18 months tracking down some four dozen witnesses , 21 of whom appear in the TV trial . Those testifying for the prosecution range from experts in pathology and ballistics to former Oswald acquaintances like Buell Wesley Frazier , who drove him to work on the day of the assassination . The defense witnesses include Dr. Cyril Wecht , a pathologist , who argues that a single bullet could not ( as the official version states ) have struck both Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally , and others who give evidence suggesting that Oswald was the patsy in a conspiracy , possibly involving Oswald 's killer , Jack Ruby . The trial includes a detailed examination of the famous film taken by Abraham Zapruder , including the horrific frames in which the President 's head literally explodes from a gunshot.                @ @ @ @ @
