The goal that President Reagan has set for his new Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI or ' ' star wars ' ' ) is to render nuclear weapons ' ' impotent and obsolete. ' ' // The investigation of just how far these two goals are compatible prescribes the agenda for the most ambitious arms control talks ever attempted . To be sure , there are other issues in the talks : ordinary intercontinental missiles and intermediate-range missiles . But ' ' star wars ' ' remains the nub of the problem. // // To an extraordinary degree for what is still only a drawing-board project ( with current funding scarcely exceeding the levels that related research would have had even if Mr. Reagan had never called for SDI ) , ' ' star wars ' ' has come to dominate the nuclear debate. // It has brought the Soviets back to the negotiating table - with the clear aim of stopping the program . It is prodding a rather alarmed Western Europe toward greater European security coordination in an attempt to present a united front to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being hailed in the US as either a panacea or a catastrophe. // It will transform superpower negotiation - if the US lead is followed - from old-fashioned horse-trading to an unprecedented fundamental consideration of what nuclear conditions actually constitute stability and promote peace. // As Secretary of State George Shultz put it after meeting Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in January to set up these negotiations , the US is inviting the Soviet Union to join in a ' ' philosophical ' ' exploration of whether there could be a radical shift of deterrence from an offensive to a defensive basis . Mr. Shultz specified that SDI is just a research program designed to answer this question - not a hard and fast commitment to development and deployment. // Similarly , Nitze has stressed that SDI , if it is to enhance stability and be worth deploying , must meet tough criteria of survivability and ' ' cost effectiveness . ' ' That is , it must be cheaper to deploy antimissile weapons than to multiply ways of countering them . Otherwise it will only trigger an open-ended arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how well or poorly SDI would pass Nitze ' s test . But it is clear that the results would differ depending on just what sort of antimissile defense might be erected . An ' ' astrodome ' ' that would provide 100 percent defense for both superpowers - assuming they survived a decade of transition from an offensive to a defensive balance - would strengthen superpower stability. // But by neutralizing superpower nuclear weapons , it could also - in the great fear of the Europeans - leave Western Europe at the mercy of Soviet-bloc conventional superiority on the Continent . Such a development would assure the security of a fortress America but could hardly assure the stability of Europe. // Alternatively , an American astrodome defense that the Soviets could not replicate has seemed to be the goal of some of the original SDI enthusiasts . Such a development would clearly reestablish the US nuclear superiority of the 1950s and ' 60s and enable Washington to dictate security terms to the rest of the world. // Neither outcome seems probable at this stage . An exclusive comprehensive defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has consistently taken the technological lead in the nuclear age , the Soviet Union has consistently imitated within five or six years whatever the US has pioneered. // That would not be long enough for the US to erect its astrodome defense , according to the projections of Nitze and others . And if it were attempted , it would give Moscow a highly dangerous incentive to force a nuclear showdown before it fell into decisive inferiority and lost its superpower status. // Nor does an astrodome defense for both the US and the Soviet Union seem all that likely , given the formidable technological hurdles. // According to Nitze ' s test of survivability and cost effectiveness , whatever components were deployed in space ( in what has until now been deemed a sitting-duck regular orbit ) would have to be defendable - by some technology that would not simultaneously defend the more elusive missiles the SDI space components would be targeting. // And according to a study just published by Georgetown University ' s hard-nosed Center for Strategic and International Studies , ' ' A ballistic-missile defense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates does not now appear to be a realistic possibility. ' ' // If no comprehensive defense of populations is feasible through disabling , say , 90 to 100 percent of incoming warheads , then two realistic possibilities are left - as Reagan administration officials have been implying with increasing frequency . The US could knowingly deploy an antimissile defense that was only partially effective - not for impossible military protection of cities , but for a political display of toughness toward the Soviets . Or it could aim at some kind of SDI that would protect weapons but not populations. // Traditional Western hard-liners would welcome the first course . Traditional advocates of arms control strenuously oppose it as profoundly destabilizing - inducing exactly the wrong kind of confrontational response in the xenophobic Kremlin leadership without bestowing any compensating military advantage to the West. // The battle lines have not yet been drawn up on the second option , the ' ' point defense ' ' of offensive missiles that will become possible in the 1990s . This would probably entail superhardening of one ' s own missile silos or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antimissile missiles and perhaps some very limited antimissile lasers or mirrors in space . The key antimissile missiles could be deployed , of course , only in contravention of the existing Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty or after a renunciation or revision of it. // Such a development , contend proponents of such a point defense , could conceivably go a long way toward allaying the mutual fears that have sprung up in the 1980s about the adversary ' s capability and incentive for a first strike. // Ironically , a move in this direction , far from restoring a classical pre-1945 defense as Reagan has been championing in promoting his SDI , would probably shore up the very balance of offensive terror that Reagan has been hoping to escape from . It would aim at restoring the eroded survivability of weapons of attack . It would reinstate the old MAD , or mutual assured destruction : The ultimate weapons would remain invulnerable , while populations would remain so utterly vulnerable that they would continue to be hostages against either side ' s initiating a suicidal nuclear war. // This reversion , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' once both superpowers had their point defenses in place . That is , it could reduce still more the likelihood that either superpower would press the nuclear button in a calculated attempt to defeat the adversary. // But would such a development also strengthen ' ' crisis stability ' ' ? That is , would it reduce the risk that in the heat of some confrontation the superpowers might slide into escalation to nuclear war out of hubris , despair , preemption , or some other miscalculation ? Most critically , perhaps , would it strengthen ' ' crisis stability ' ' during the very difficult 10-to-15 year transition period that is foreseen by Nitze in getting from here to there ? // More broadly , what SDI option would most contribute to stability and therefore to peace ? How much American SDI is enough to show American determination but not so much as to stoke the very nuclear tension it is intended to avoid ? Would Washington and Moscow now engage in a mutually constructive instead of a mutually destructive designing of the 21st century ? // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan , a very new General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachov , and the negotiating teams at Geneva. // //
