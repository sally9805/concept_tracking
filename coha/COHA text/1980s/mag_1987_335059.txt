The elegantly dressed tailors on London 's Savile Row , who cater to customers willing to spend $1,250 for a custom-made suit , at times decide to " take it in a little . " But now some fear that their own historic district may soon be subject to alterations that could send it the way of the Nehru jacket . A zoning change before Britain 's Environment Secretary would eliminate the distinction between offices and light industry . The tailors fear that once landlords realized they could convert Savile Row 's shops from light-industry status into office space , rents would quadruple and many shops in the 140- year-old district would be forced to close . <P> The normally quiet tailors , who account for 3,000 jobs and more than $44 million in annual sales , are not sitting around with their hands in their pockets . Some have written letters to Parliament . Others have asked U.S. customers , who make up 60% of Savile Row 's clientele , to protest to the British embassy .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
