Two political films win prizes , but E.T . gets the cheers <P> The Indians , " says a character in I Werner Herzog 's epic movie Fitz-carraldo , " believe that the waking world is a fantasy from which we escape into our real life - our dream life . " Herzog should know : he was one of 35,000 dreamers at the 35th Cannes Film Festival . For 13 days on the cool but sunny Cte d'Azur , fantasies of art and avarice were spun with blithe disregard for events in the waking world outside . On the faade of the town 's posh Carlton Hotel , an electronic ticker tape mixed bulletins from the Malouines ( Falklands ) with screening schedules for the night 's new films . While two movies about political prisoners - Costa- Gavras ' Missing and a Turkish production , Yilmaz Gney 's Yol - were winning the festival 's top prize , the restaurants were abuzz with the latest news from Sophia Loren 's pink-walled prison in Caserta near Naples . Comedy , melodrama , illusion 24 times per second . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off the screen . <P> The festival is one of the world 's largest international gatherings . It is too large to satisfy the restless crowds and their hopes for great movies , big bucks or an invitation to the right party . And so there are three coexisting subfestivals . On the one hand , Cannes is a glutton 's banquet of world cinema : some 350 movies unspooling at all hours in more than a dozen theaters . On the other , it is a showplace and marketplace for the industry 's producers , distributors and exhibitors , from Hollywood moguls to Hong Kong porn merchants . And on the third hand - the one in your pocket : Cannes also attracts Europe 's most expert pickpockets - the festival is a gilded airstrip for the jet set . The three groups can busy themselves 20 hours a day and rarely cross paths or interests . <P> In the 2,500-seat theater of the Palais des Festivals , where the two dozen official selections are shown , film buffs file in at 1 in the morning for Hans-Jrgen Syberberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later they stagger out into the dawn 's hazy light , exhausted and exhilarated . In midafternoon , Menahem Golan , the Israeli producer who now heads his own distribution company , sits on a teeming Carlton terrace flanked by Stalin-era-size posters of his stars : Faye Dunaway , Robert Mitchum , Brooke Shields , Lou Ferrigno . " I have sold a million dollars in film rights each day at Cannes , " Golan purrs , but " I did better last month at the American Film Market in Los Angeles . " Night falls , and for the assiduous epicure , hopes rise : before long he may be amid sparkling silverware and sleek brown shoulders at a dinner party Harold Robbins is throwing for Pia Zadora , the star of a new movie made from his novel Lonely Lady-and one of the year 's show-off starlets for photographers . The experiences of one party provide conversational fodder for the next . " Loved Inchon , " said one professional gadfly the day after the $45 million movie financed by Sun Myung Moon premiered to near unanimous pans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " the gadfly replied . " Inchon the dinner . "
