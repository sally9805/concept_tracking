Japanese officials are facing several deadlines in trade talks with the US next spring . Failure to make visible progress by that time , officials say , will lead to protectionist measures against Japan. // A fierce debate is currently taking place within the Japanese government bureaucracy and the ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) over what specific actions to take . The policy clash is mostly being carried out behind closed doors , with occasional leaks in the Japanese press. // // A variety of measures are being proposed to bring down Japan ' s $80 billion-plus trade surplus , almost $50 billion of which is with the US . According to a senior government policymaker , the toughest battle is being fought between advocates of a policy to encourage imports and those who favor restraining Japanese exports. // The dispute combines typical elements of decisionmaking in Japan - struggles for power between rival ministries , competing interest-group lobbies , and divided politicians . This is complicated by a coming election for the lower house of Japan ' s parliament , likely in mid-February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority rule. // ' ' The most important thing at this point is to import more , ' ' the senior government policymaker says . A move to improve the trade balance by simply exporting less would curb economic growth in the world economy . It is better to provide larger markets for US and other goods , the official says. // The main advocate of this view is the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) , which is pushing for a variety of policies to encourage imports . Most directly , MITI favors tax incentives for importers , a reverse of its successful policies of the 1950s and ' 60s to encourage exports from Japan . Given the difficulties and higher costs that newcomers face in penetrating the well-developed Japanese market , MITI officials explain , importers should get some help. // Indirectly , MITI is actively pressuring Japanese exporters to increase their imports on a company-by-company basis . According to press reports , MITI has singled out about 50 to 60 companies , such as auto and electronic manufacturers , which together account for 60 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to double their imports in three years . Auto companies , for example , plan to import cars made in their own plants in the US . MITI ' s plans are being opposed by the powerful Ministry of Finance and by elements of the LDP . Ministry of Finance bureaucrats oppose tax incentives for imports . They say such incentives will reduce tax revenues and will unfairly benefit one group of industries over another. // According to the senior official , many members of the LDP favor the quick fix of controlling exports . One method is to set ceilings on certain items , such as autos . Some favor a tax on exports. // Behind this position , the official says accusingly , is a political calculation to shift pressure from agriculture and the demand to open Japan ' s rice market . That would lose the LDP support from farmers , a key bloc for votes and funding . In addition , ' ' the LDP dislikes businessmen these days because they did not give enough money for election campaigns , ' ' the official suggests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japanese analysts say , until after the elections . If the LDP retains its majority , as now appears likely , it may be better able to make painful reforms. // The Bush administration has indicated a willingness to wait until then on a number of fronts. // The agenda of trade issues is long and complex . Last spring the Bush administration named Japan as an unfair trader under the ' ' Super 301 ' ' clause of the Trade Act . The US cited three specific industries ( satellites , supercomputers , and lumber products ) , where barriers to purchase of foreign goods existed , as items for negotiations . Aside from these , there are other industries in which talks are ongoing , including semiconductors and construction. // Failure to resolve problems in these specific areas could bring retaliatory sanctions , such as tariffs , next year. // The most daunting trade negotiation is the Structural Impediments Initiative ( SII ) , an effort to remove basic barriers to trade in both economies . The US seeks changes in Japan ' s maze-like distribution system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high savings rate . At the last round of talks , the two countries agreed on comparative data showing that Japanese consumers pay substantially higher prices for most goods. // Japan points to the need for US action to correct its low savings rate , corporate fixation on short-term profits , its budget deficit , and poor education. // Two rounds of SII talks have taken place since September , with the next round scheduled for January in Tokyo . By the fourth round in mid-March , the two governments must complete an ' ' interim assessment , ' ' concluding with a final agenda of action by the summer . US congressional leaders are pressing for clear steps by the time of the interim report. // While Japanese officials say the fundamental problems addressed in SII require a long time to solve , they are also aware of the need to produce ' ' concrete steps ' ' by the spring . Those measures would be a down payment on structural reform , aimed at easing the pressure for anti-Japan sanctions. // The Japanese package could include a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from import incentives , Japan would increase spending on social infrastructure , stimulating demand at home . The staff and powers of the weak Fair Trade Commission , which carries out antimonopoly laws , will be increased . Price-gap research would be regularized , adding pressure to open the distribution channels. // And finally , the government and LDP are considering a controversial move to remove the exemption from property tax granted to farmland in urban areas , which acts as a disincentive to put the land to other use . The US seeks that change to lower the high price of land , a barrier to new business and growth at home. // Japanese officials also intend to press the US to make comparable changes . But , says a MITI official , ' ' It ' s no good to just blame it on America. ' ' // //
