Amid the destruction in Lebanon , Israelis and Arabs look to the U.S. <P> The Israeli circle of steel swung shut around Beirut . Caught in the ancient city , the forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization braced for the final assault . But far more than the P.L.O . ' s fate hung in the balance . Israel 's blitz had thoroughly scrambled the pieces of the Middle East puzzle , posing enormous risks and offering unexpected opportunities to work for peace in that embattled and strategically vital corner of the world . If the P.L.O . were neutralized and the Syrians persuaded to depart the country , there would be a chance that a strong , stable Lebanese government could be shaped from the various Christian and Muslim factions that shared power before the 1975-76 civil war . The battering of the P.L.O . military forces also raised faint hopes that such moderate states as Saudi Arabia and Jordan , freed from the threat of Palestinian reprisals , might join Egypt in the Camp David peace process . On the other hand , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a new wave of international terror . If the situation in Lebanon flared out of control , moderate Arab states might give up any immediate hope of working for peace in the region and again join the radicals in a united front bitterly and militantly opposed to Israel . <P> President Ronald Reagan planned to discuss these compelling issues this week in Washington with Prime Minister Menachem Begin .

Although Moscow warned that its national interests were threatened by Israel 's invasion , U.S. officials privately noted with relief the mildness of the Soviet reaction . <P> Seeking to head off a bloody showdown in Beirut , U.S. officials scrambled to restore the short-lived Israeli-P.L.O. cease-fire that had broken down on June 13 .

He met with Lebanese President Elias Sarkis and other members of the proposed National Salvation Committee in the hope of devising a coalition government representing all major Lebanese factions . Habib 's goal : to encourage a united stand for negotiating an Israeli withdrawal and dealing with the P.L.O . and the Syrians . <P> At Habib 's request , Secretary of State Alexander Haig telephoned Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Moshe Arens on Wednesday to ask for a strict 48-hour truce . Habib needed the time to persuade the P.L.O . to submit to Lebanese government authority . Arens made no formal reply , but Israeli guns finally fell silent 24 hours later than Haig had requested . However , an aide traveling with Begin in the U.S. last week told TIME that Israel would not commit itself to a formal cease-fire but would consider arrangements to allow the P.L.O . to depart from the capital peacefully . Said the aide : " We do n't mind at all if the P.L.O . evacuates Beirut . We wo n't fire at anyone who does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
