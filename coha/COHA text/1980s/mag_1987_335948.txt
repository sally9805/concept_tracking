Why are our days numbered and not , say , lettered ? <P>  --  Woody Allen <P> With this posthumous volume , S.J. Perelman answers his most famous acolyte . The days of the humorist were lettered , with explosive messages to family , colleagues , editors and amours . <P> In some 20 books of collected short pieces , Perelman offered a unique amalgam of elegant phrase and pratfall comedy . Behind each one was the carefully drawn self-portrait of a curmudgeon , skewering the pretentious , detonating popular culture and putting backspin on cliches ( " Jigwise , all is up " ) . The role of sulfurous commentator was not a disguise . Do n't Tread on Me proves that the life story of Perelman was the adventures of Mr. Hyde and Mr. Hyde . Early on he decided that Will Rogers ' statement " I never met a man I did n't like " was " pure flatulence , crowd-pleasing and fake humility , " and acted accordingly .

" <P> Dorothy Herrmann 's recent biography , S.J. Perelman : A Life , points out what any sensible reader already knows : humorists are not a sunny breed . They pick up their tribulations by the wrong end , and that provokes mirth . But after the audience leaves , the anguish remains . Perelman 's boon companion and brother- in-law , Novelist Nathanael West ( Miss Lonelyhearts ) , died young ( 36 ) in a car crash . Perelman never fully recovered from the blow , nor did his wife Laura , who descended into alcoholism . Many of his best letters deal obliquely with the disappointments he felt with his family and his work : he did not write a full-length book or earn a big payday in Hollywood .
