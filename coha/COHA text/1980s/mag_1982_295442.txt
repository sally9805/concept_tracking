As Israeli forces massed on the Lebanese border , TIME CorreAs Israeli forces massed on the Lebanese border , TIME Correspondent Dean Brelis drove south from Beirut to talk to a P.L.O . leader . His report : <P> <P> Once past Sidon on the coastal road south to Tyre , twelve miles from the Israeli border , there was a sense of hurry . <P> The traffic seemed to move faster . We were approaching what could become a war zone , and the troops in the orange groves were Palestinians . We turned a corner and got a quick glimpse of Soviet-made missile launchers . They turned left and disappeared as nimbly as a shadow darting in and out . But we saw enough to know they were new and mobile , and we remembered that when the P.L.O . opened its guns the last time , aiming at the Israeli settlements across the border , they hit 37 of their targets . <P> We left lyre behind and began seeing Palestinian troops again , lunching in the shade . Shortly thereafter , we stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official who was acting as our guide . It did not look like much : a simple , hutlike shelter such as shepherds use . Guards watched as we bent to pass through the door . Stairs led down several levels to a vast underground complex with thick , reinforced-concrete walls . <P> " Welcome , " said Commandant Azmi Zghayar . He was about 5 ft. 10 in. , carried a cane and walked with a slight limp , the result of a wound suffered during a raid on Israel . He wore a khaki wool sweater and green fatigues , and a pistol was tucked into his hip pocket . <P> " The Israeli invasion is what about , " you he said . want to Then a talk shrug , suggesting that to him an Israeli invasion was just another event , like the sun rising . " We would rather talk peace . But they say we of the P.L.O . are terrorists , so we must fight . <P> This rides Lebanon they will send 50,000 men and 500 tanks , and we are ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are ready . We do n't deceive ourselves that we can match them , but we can make them pay a very high price . We are stronger than we 've ever been . " <P> Zghayar said he hoped that the P.L.O . could cause enough Israeli casualties to convince the Begin government that it must deal with the organization that Israel has scorned so far . Warned Zghayar : " We will counterattack and this time we will hit more northern settlements . We have that ability , both with rockets and artillery . If they come back into southern Lebanon , we are going to hold our positions and we will fight back . They give us no other choice . " <P> When talk began of a possible invasion , Zghayar wired his wife , who was on a visit to Kuwait , to return home to Lebanon immediately with their three sons . " We Palestinians are all one family , and both in times of great joy and great danger , we believe in being together , and not separated . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from here , where you can look out and see Palestine . I hold them in my arms , and tell them , ' My son , breathe deeply of that air . It is the air of your homeland , and never forget what it means to have seen it this way , and breathed of it , from a distance . One day we will walk back and life will again be peaceful .
