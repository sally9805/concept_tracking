As a former member of the National Alcohol Fuels Commission , Democratic Congressman Bill Alexander of Arkansas wanted to take advantage of the August recess to inspect Brazil 's production of ethanol . It is an unwritten House rule that Congressmen can request the services of a Pentagon plane only if three or four of them travel together . So Alexander invited four of his colleagues to join him on his six-day sojourn . He sent their names to Speaker Tip O'Neill , who asked the Pentagon to secure a jet for the group . But when the Air Force C-9 took off for Sao Paulo , Alexander , 51 , the House chief deputy majority whip , was the only Congressman among the nine passengers aboard . None of the four legislators Alexander had asked along agreed to accompany him . <P> The C-9 , which can carry as many as 42 passengers , costs taxpayers $2,310 for each flying hour . Although it was expensive , Alexander claimed the trip did produce something : primarily , a letter of intent from Brazil to exchange research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when the Congressman returned to the U.S. via Honduras , he paid his own way .
