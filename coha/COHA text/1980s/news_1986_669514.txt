That view is shared by Israeli and American officials who , in interviews , said the degree and scope of cooperation between the two nations now is unprecedented. // ' ' The relationship between the United States and Israel has never been better in the 38 years of formal relations , ' ' says Arthur Berger , spokesman for the US Embassy in Tel Aviv . ' ' It runs the gamut from diplomatic cooperation to the search for peace . We don ' t see eye to eye on everything , but the disagreements are more on details and tactics. ' ' // // ' ' We are probably at the apex of bilateral ties since the state was established , ' ' says Harry Wall , executive director of the Anti-Defamation League ' s Jerusalem bureau . The ADL monitors US press coverage of and shifts in US public attitudes toward Israel . ' ' I can ' t think of a better period in terms of political , strategic , and economic cooperation , ' ' he adds. // For Israel , good ties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuance of change in US positions on Middle East issues . The government is aware of Israel ' s increasing economic and political dependence on the United States and exp nds enormous effort in smoothing over differences that arise. // Only last spring , Israel feared it might clash with the US over the best method to restart the Mideast peace process . Jordan ' s King Hussein had agreed to pursue a joint peace strategy with the Palestine Liberation Organization in February 1985 , then garnered US support for his efforts when he visited Washington in May. // King Hussein focused his efforts on convincing the US that it should start talking to the PLO . Israeli officials regarded the prospects of the PLO being included in the peace process with alarm . An administration decision to accept the guerrilla organization as a partner to negotiations would have caused a serious rift in relations between Israel and the US , officials here say. // Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses to consider its inclusion in any negotiating process. // Even moderate Arab leaders such as Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward without the PLO . The PLO is regarded by the Arabs as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians . All sides agree the Palestinians must be included in any negotiations over the future of the territories that Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , but all do not agree that the PLO is their legitimate representative. // ' ' Should negotiations ever get under way , Israel is going to be expected to perform , ' ' says one Israeli analyst . ' ' Should the PLO stand up and say , ' We recognize Israel , ' things could take on a very different coloration. ' ' // Chances of that happening dramatically decreased last month , however , when Hussein formally ended his joint efforts with the PLO leadership in a 3 - hour televised speech . The King blamed the PLO , not Israel or the US , for what he termed another missed opportunity for peace. // Hussein ' s Feb. 19 break with the PLO dashed hopes of a breakthrough in the peace process , but also reassured the Israelis that they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout the US involvement in Hussein ' s efforts , one Israeli official says , Israel was confident that the Reagan administration would not push the Jewish state as hard as previous administrations in search of a breakthrough. // The US administration ' s restraint was due partly to its perception that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was forthcoming in his efforts to ease the King ' s way to a negotiating table . Throughout his term , Mr. Peres has scored points with the Americans for his apparent flexibility and willingness to work with the administration - an image that US diplomats say is in sharp contrast with that of his hard-line Likud predecessors , Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin. // But the US approach is seen here essentially as the result of President Reagan ' s unswerving support of Israel. // ' ' Mr. Reagan sees Israel as such an asset , ' ' says Eitan Ben Tzur , head of the Foreign Ministry ' s North American desk . ' ' He wants to have peace in the area , but one that would be , first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel more highly than he regards any other country in the area - because of its pro-Western leanings , its shared values with the United States , its strategic importance , and its military might. ' ' // Israel measures US support in terms of the economic and political backing the US extends , the degree of cooperation between the military establishments of the two nations , the tone of US press reports , and readings from public opinion polls. // The complex network of relations between the two nations sometimes makes their dealings appear more like those between family members than between two sovereign states . <> <> Putting Israel ' s economy in order // The US ' s deep involvement in Israel ' s economic recovery program is but one example of the unique relationship , officials here say. // When Peres formed his government in September 1984 , its first priority was to save Israel from economic collapse . His first visit outside the country was to Washington , where he requested and was promised $1. 5 billion in supplementary aid. // Along with the aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee designed to work out concrete steps that the Israelis could take to put their economic house in order . The committee continues to meet periodically. // Amnon Neubach , economic adviser to Peres , says that pressure exerted by the US economists on the joint committee helped to convince Peres that Israel had no choice but to take Draconian measures to restore the economy. // ' ' When they ( the US economists ) came in July 1985 , the figures on the economy were very bad. // ' ' The Americans told me that they did not believe we were going to do something and they said they did not know if they would recommend to help us anymore . They pushed a little the prime minister , ' ' Mr. Neubach says . At the time the US had not yet transferred the emergency supplementary aid , and Israel desperately needed the funds to replace its depleted foreign-currency reserves. // Neubach emphasizes that the ' ' pushing ' ' has always been done in ' ' a polite , friendly manner . The Americans have given us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us how we must do it , ' ' he says. // Economic cooperation is just one way Ronald Reagan ' s presidency has been good for Israel , according to the Israelis . Reagan has been more consistently supportive of Israel than any US President since Harry Truman . His secretary of state , George Shultz , was viewed with suspicion here at the time of his appointment because of his ties with the Arab world through his former employer , an engineering consulting firm called the Bechtel Group . Mr. Shultz now is regarded here as strongly pro-Israel. // The Israelis say they believe the President ' s support is based on his belief that the United States needs a reliable ally in the eastern Mediterranean to serve , in the words of one analyst , ' ' as a bulwark against the Soviet Union , which is Public Enemy No. 1 in Reagan ' s mind. // ' ' But the Israelis say they also believe the President ' s strong support of Israel stems at least partly from a deep-seated emotional identification with the tiny nation. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cowboy , ' ' Wall says . ' ' He can identify with this ' lone ranger ' over here making this one part of the area safe for Americans and American values. // ' ' That identification was enhanced , according to Israeli analysts , last year when a spate of terrorist attacks claimed American lives in Europe and the Middle East . The President and Shultz came out in favor of the Israeli policy of retaliating against terrorist attacks whenever possible. // Israelis list several areas in which they feel relations between the two nations have substantially improved under the Reagan presidency : // * US military and economic aid to Israel has grown to an all-time high . It stands now at a combined total of $3. 75 billion for fiscal 1986 . All of the money is in the form of grants . Israel is the single largest recipient of US foreign aid . Although Israel is considered a US ally , there is no treaty commitment on either side. // * The administration became more directly involved in Israel ' s economy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted to repair its tattered economy after Peres assumed the premiership in September 1984 . A joint Israel-US economic team was established. // * In 1985 the two nations signed a free-trade pact that will eliminate all tariffs between them within 10 years. // * Israel became one of the first US allies to enthusiastially embrace Washington ' s offer of participation in research for President Reagan ' s space-based Strategic Defense Initiative ( popularly known as ' ' star wars ' ' ) . It also granted the US permission to build a Voice of America radio transmitter on Israeli soil , after other nations turned down the request . The facility will beam broadcasts to the Soviet Union. // * In the United Nations , the US has risked the wrath of Arab states by consistently vetoing key UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned Israel for a number of actions. // * In the peace process , the US has continued to keep its 1974 pledge not to negotiate with the PLO until that organization recognizes Israel and accepts UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories it occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , but assert its right to exist . The PLO rejects the resolutions because the Palestinians are referred to only as a refugee problem , without mention of Palestinian self-determination. // The United States has backed Israel ' s insistence that any negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors be direct negotiations , without preconditions. // * The two nations held joint military manuevers in 1985 , increased their sharing of intelligence information , and generally enhanced their strategic cooperation , according to Israeli military sources . <> <> The joint battle against terrorism // In 1985 , a year that saw an increase in acts of terrorism , the US and Israel drew closer in their fight against terrorism . President Reagan initially seemed to condone Israel ' s Oct. 1 air raid on PLO headquarters in Tunis , which killed 70 people . Eventually , however , the US abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution condemning the bombing. // Israel later applauded the US for intercepting an Egyptian airliner carrying the suspected hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts , Israel and her most important ally appear to have forged ever-stronger ties since Reagan assumed office in 1980. // The improvement in ties has continued despite strains that emerged after Israel ' s invasion of Lebanon and seige of Beirut in the summer of 1982 . Mr. Ben Tzur says he believes the months following the June 1982 invasion of Lebanon may have been the bleakest days in US-Israeli relations - both on a government-to-government level and in terms of how Americans viewed Israel. // Relations between then-Prime Minister Begin and his defense minister , Ariel Sharon , and their American counterparts grew more strained as the scope of the Israeli invasion became clear. // Relations between the two nations began to improve again when Lebanese President Amin Gemayel abrogated the May 1983 US-brokered agreement between Israel and Lebanon that was to have ended Israel ' s occupation of Lebanon . Under heavy Syrian pressure , Mr. Gemayel abrogated the accord nine months after it was signed. // Shultz had considered the agreement his first major achievement as secretary of state , and was reportedly outraged when Gemayel backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to underscore for the Americans the unreliability of some Arab regimes. // The next crisis in relations came when Reagan announced that , during a state visit to West Germany , he would visit a German war cemetery in Bitburg . The cemetery , it turned out , also contained bodies of Nazi SS troops . There was an outcry in the US Jewish community , and a more muted protest from the Peres government . In the end , Reagan proceeded with his visit , though he made it much shorter than originally planned . In June 1985 , relations were strained again during the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet and its mostly American passengers by Shiite Muslim fundamentalists. // The Shiites , who finally landed the plane in Beirut , demanded that Israel release hundreds of Lebanese prisoners it was holding in an Israeli prison in return for the freedom of the 39 American hostages . For several tense days , Israel and the Reagan administration were at a standoff over who should appear to give into the hijackers ' demands . Ultimately , the Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TWA hijacking were minor incidents , however , compared to the arrest in Washington last fall of Jonathan Jay Pollard , an American accused of spying for Israel. // The Pollard affair had the potential to seriously damage relations between the two nations , both US and Israeli analysts agree . Mr. Pollard was a civilian employed in naval intelligence . He is accused of passing top-secret information to Israel in return for cash payments . Eventually , Israel admitted that it had been spying on the US , said that the incident was an isolated and unauthorized one , apologized , and allowed an American team to question Israeli intelligence officers involved with Pollard . Israel ultimately returned the stolen documents. // Both Israeli and US officials now say that the Israeli response contained what could have been a disastrous situation for Israel . Officials of both countries also say that the Pollard case says a lot about the limits to bilateral ties between nations - no matter how close those ties may be. // ' ' The bottom line is that Israel simply can not completely trust anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tel Aviv. // //
