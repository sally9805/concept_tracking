Despite a satellite loss , Challenger opens a new era in orbit <P> When the space shuttle Challenger lifted off from Florida last week , the roaring flames signaled the start of NASA 's busiest year in space . Ten missions are scheduled for 1984 , including one with a secret Pentagon payload . But Challenger had barely settled into orbit 190 miles above the earth on the tenth shuttle mission when space gremlins struck . A multimillion-dollar communications satellite , one of two carried on board , mysteriously vanished into the void . Still , in spite of the embarrassing loss , NASA hoped to redeem itself with another of its spectaculars . This week , for the first time , astronauts plan to take a true step into space , leaving the safety of the mother ship without so much as a frail wire to prevent them from drifting off toward infinity . <P> These orbital theatrics have a high purpose . In pushing off from Challenger 's open cargo bay , Astronauts Bruce McCandless II , 46 , and Robert Stewart , 41 , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rehearsing the first repair of a satellite in orbit . That is slated to take place in April , when astronauts attempt to retrieve and revive a $150 million robot scientific observatory nicknamed Solar Max , which has been spinning helplessly since it broke down three years ago . If this tinkering succeeds , it could pave the way for even more ambitious efforts , including the assembly of President Reagan 's proposed space station . <P> For the moment , however , NASA 'S attention was more pressingly diverted . Just eight hours into the flight , Mission Specialist Ronald McNair , 33 , a physicist making his first flight , successfully sent Western Union 's $75 million Westar VI spinning out of Challenger 's big cargo bay . But soon all contact with Westar , built by Hughes Aircraft , was lost . Its transmitters were silent . Ground-based trackers could not tell whether its booster , which was to have propelled it into a geostationary " parking place " 22,300 miles above the equator , had misfired or some onboard electronics had failed . Desperately trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still any electronic stirrings in the complex machine , the controllers blindly sent radio signals into space . Later the trackers detected a number of unidentified objects orbiting behind the shuttle . Officials gloomily speculated that they might be fragments from an explosion that destroyed the satellite . <P> The failure immediately confronted NASA with the question of whether it should go ahead with the launch of Westar 's twin , Indonesia 's Palapa B2 , scheduled for the next day . Palapa is to be used as a telecommunications link between the 13,677 islands of the sprawling Indonesian archipelago . At week 's end , NASA decided to postpone the launch at least for a day while ground controllers probed the Westar accident . If Indonesia requested a deferral until a later mission , the shuttle would have to bring the satellite back to earth . The added weight would speed the shuttle 's descent on landing , possibly forcing NASA to scrub a Florida touchdown.
