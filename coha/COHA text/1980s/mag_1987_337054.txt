Am I my brother 's keeper ? God answered Cain 's evasive question by putting him under an eternal curse , and so the traditional answer has been a cautious affirmative . But what if my brother already has a keeper , one who has a gun and who claims the right to decide whether my brother will get any of the food I send him ? <P> That is more or less the question that bedevils Western officials as they face the horrors of another famine in the Ethiopia of Lieut . Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam . All too clear in the public memory are those televised pictures from 1984-85 of starving children with their matchstick arms , their swollen bellies and their huge , staring eyes . The public may also remember reports of relief shipments being taxed $50 a ton to help finance Mengistu 's 225,000-man army , the largest in black Africa , and of sacks of Western grain rotting on the docks or disappearing into the black market . <P> As if Mengistu 's tyranny were not bad enough , the secessionist rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will interfere with United Nations food shipments . Says Manuel Pietri of the Paris-based International Aid Against Hunger : " There is a perverse game between the government and the rebels to make aid not work , unless , of course , they can turn it to their own advantage . " But the stronger of the two parties , Mengistu 's government , is the source of most of the trouble . Says an aid official in Washington : " I 'll tell you what the government 's three priorities are : fighting the rebels , fighting the rebels and fighting the rebels . " Comments a colleague : " The Ethiopian government has the worst human rights record in Africa . " <P> This sense of Ethiopia as a bottomless sinkhole for Western aid inspires some skeptical experts to wonder whether such assistance is really wise . Regular international rescue efforts do little to encourage recipients to learn to feed themselves , the skeptics argue , and a tougher approach just might force Ethiopia to mend its ways . " What will aid do ? " asked Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion of Ethiopia 's ignorant rulers . The weather is the only calamity not directly caused by Colonel Mengistu . . . and his cronies . Their Russian advisers have taught them to run vast state farms that produce no food . Imitating Stalin 's anti-kulak terror , they have shot ' hoarders and saboteurs ' prudent enough to store grain . . . Help for the starving may make some of them suffer more , and reinforce the grip of the government that caused them to starve . Yet something must be done . " <P> But what ? " The aid Ethiopians need is diplomatic pressure , not food , " says Rony Brauman of Doctors Without Borders , a French charitable organization that was expelled from Ethiopia two years ago for criticizing Mengistu 's brutally handled program to resettle residents of rebel-threatened areas . " If we have a duty , it is to pressure the government to change its policies . Otherwise , in two or three years , we 're going to see the same bodies , the same TV footage , the same appeals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a French government official asks , " Who is going to take the responsibility for saying ' All right , now we 're going to stop all aid . Finished . Not one more sack of flour ' ? At that point , you 've reached the political and moral limits of the debate . "
