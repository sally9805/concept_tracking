They believe that the gene is an important key to the virus ' s power to cause disease , that it explains how the virus produces some of its effects and that a better understanding of the gene may eventually lead to new ways to prevent or treat AIDS infections. // Two new reports in the journal Science describe the gene and its discovery , noting that it is unusually small and situated at a place in the virus ' s genetic material where no gene was thought to exist . The reports say the gene is the blueprint for a protein that regulates the rate at which virus-infected cells are forced to make new virus particles. // This replication rate is an indication of the virulence of an infection . The more viruses an infected cell makes , the more rapidly the infection can spread and cause damage . The AIDS virus , known variously as HTLV-III and LAV , produces infection involving great virus proliferation , with devastating effects on the human immune defenses . <> <> Important Implications // Discovery of the gene also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in human and animal cells as well as in viruses , the scientists said . Genes with similar function , but far larger than the comparable one in HTLV-III , were discovered earlier in three related viruses : HTLV-I and HTLV-II , both of which infect humans , and bovine leukemia virus , cause of cancers in cattle . HTLV-I causes some forms of human leukemia and lymphoma . HTLV-II , found originally in a human cancer , has not yet been proved to cause any disease. // The newly identified regulatory system common to these viruses has been named transactivation by Dr. William A. Haseltine , of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School . He said transactivation might also have counterparts in other organisms. // The products of transactivating viral genes appear to force the cells they infect into an abnormally high state of growth and reproductive activity . Under this influence they make abnormally large numbers of the virus particles , or of the products of any other genes that come under the influence of the system. // In laboratory experiments , cells infected with HTLV-I accelerated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while cells infected with HTLV-III were boosted to as much as 1 , 000 times normal activity . <> <> ' New Kind of Genetic Regulation ' // " This is a brand new kind of genetic regulation , " said Dr. Haseltine . " There is nothing quite like this as far as I know . We believe this may be the prototype of a whole new class of mechanisms of genetic regulation. " // One of the new reports in Science is by Dr. Joseph Sodroski , Roberto Patarca , Dr. Craig Rosen and Dr. Haseltine , all of Harvard , and Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal of the National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Md. // The other research , done independently but in cooperation with the first group , was by scientists at the cancer institute ' s laboratory of tumor cell biology led by Dr. Wong-Staal . Her co-authors are Dr. Suresh K. Arya , Dr. Chan Guo and Dr. Steven F. Josephs. // The discovery is indicative of the giant strides that have been made in recent years in understanding the most detailed chemistry of genetics. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing a chemical blueprint for an aspect of heredity . Typically one gene is the instruction blueprint a cell uses for making a particular substance necessary to that cell ' s functioning or reproduction . But , in recent years , biologists have learned that a complex interplay of factors determines whether a gene will remain inactive or be turned on so that the gene ' s product will be made by the cell. // One known class of DNA segments that exercise such regulatory functions are called promoters . As recently as five years ago , their existence was suspected but still unproved . A second class of regulators , called enhancers , was not even suspected then but has since been discovered . The third class , comprising regulatory sequences called transactivating targets , was discovered within the past year in HTLV-I . HTLV-III is suspected of having a comparable target sequence on which the newly discovered gene may act . These regulators are distinct from promoters and enhancers but act in concert with them . <> <> How the Viruses Differ // " HTLV-III differs from HTLV-I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dr. Wong-Staal ' s report , noting also that types I and II often transform cells in laboratory cell cultures into a cancerous state while type III usually causes cell death. // Dr. Haseltine believes the difference can probably be explained by the different activities of the two viruses ' transactivator genes . His hypothesis , presently being pursued by research , is that this could also explain the different diseases caused by HTLV-I , the cancer virus , and HTLV-III , the AIDS virus. // Both viruses attack key cells of the immune defense system called T-4 cells . HTLV-I makes them grow without discipline , as cancer . HTLV-III kills them , thus producing the devastating deterioration of immune defenses characteristic of AIDS . Dr. Haseltine says the AIDS virus probably does this by distorting the cells ' genetic machinery so that the cells age rapidly and die. // The transactivator gene is " both the mainspring and the dagger of the virus , " he said , referring to its ability to get itself reproduced efficiently and to devastate the cells that the virus infects. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the AIDS virus . The closest to practical utility , he said , is use of the transactivator gene to make cells produce huge amounts of a specific protein , such as the surface protein of the AIDS virus , which then could be used as a vaccine . Since the gene can be manipulated to accelerate the production of any available protein , Dr. Haseltine sees the gene as a valuable new tool for vaccine production in general. // Eventually , he said , the newly detailed knowledge of the gene ' s effects might also reveal a way of treating AIDS by interfering in some way with the transactivation process itself. //
