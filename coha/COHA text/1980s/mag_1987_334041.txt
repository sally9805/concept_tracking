Dubuque 's annual small-college basketball tournament is drawing some far-flung spectators this year . Delaware Senator Joe Biden and former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt , who have more on their mind than hoopsters , decided it was the place to be on Sunday . Others are likewise discovering the joys of Iowa in January . New York Congressman Jack Kemp was there twice last week , and former Delaware Governor Pete du Pont is going there this week to tell farmers how he plans to phase out commodity price supports , then heading to New Hampshire for his fifth visit in five months . <P> To most Americans , trucking desiccated Christmas trees to the dump marks the slow beginning of a new year . But for the class of 1988 , it is only 13 months before voters in Iowa begin to choose convention delegates , and 1987 seems all too short . While Washington wonders whether Ronald Reagan can recover from Iranscam , those who hope to succeed him are organizing for what promises to be the least predictable , most wide-open campaign in at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than usual . Twelve Southern and Border states , trying to increase their influence on the parties , will hold primaries on March 8 of next year . This has led some other states to move up their dates as well . By March 15 nearly half the delegates will probably have been chosen . No one knows whether this front-loaded calendar will make for early decisions or whether the large fields will fragment the results until later in the game . The presence of two Baptist ministers  --  Jesse Jackson on the Democratic left and Pat Robertson on the Republican right  --  also casts conventional scenarios in doubt . But one thing is certain : more candidates are out campaigning earlier than ever in the belief that late starters are likely to be left in the dust . <P> To mount a serious campaign next winter , a candidate must raise more than $3 million this year . Already potential contributors are scouting the field ; in Phoenix this weekend , 36 Democratic donors who have formed a group called Impac ' 88 met to discuss uniting behind one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding expert meat to their bones . Babbitt last week became the first Democrat to form a full-fledged campaign committee . In the past fortnight senior strategists also took posts in the campaigns of Kemp , Du Pont , Gary Hart and Richard Gephardt . <P> Mechanical preparations aside , the dynamics of 1988 promise drastic differences from the past four elections . For the first time since 1968 , no incumbent is running . For the first time in memory  --  since 1952 , at least  --  the race in both parties is completely open . Neither party boasts a dominant potential leader with a solid lead at this stage . <P> Robert Strauss , once Democratic chairman and now Washington 's senior soothsayer , argues , " The confluence of these political circumstances opens the nominating process wide in both parties . " Pollster Peter Hart carries that idea further , predicting that those running well behind in today 's opinion surveys will have the best chance to win the nomination . " Some of the candidates little known today will fulfill what voters will be looking for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to continuation of the stable present . "
