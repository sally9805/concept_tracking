When the high-tech industry in Silicon Valley slows down , everybody , from realtors in Cupertino to restaurant owners along Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose , gets a bad case of the blues . But one of the best barometers of the health of California 's computer manufacturers is Doug Young . He manages the Porsche dealership in Sunnyvale , in the heart of Silicon Valley . Sales at his showroom , where the most expensive models go for $50,000 , are so sensitive to the region 's economic trends that a few days of good news will generate a mini Porsche rally . On the other hand , downtime in the local semiconductor and computer industries leaves Young 's salesmen spit-shining fenders . <P> Right now , times are bad . Sales are slow , and the hardest hit model is the top-of-the-line 928 . Young is doing the once unthinkable : cutting prices . Yet he knows that many of his would-be customers harbor hopes of becoming the latest in a string of entrepreneurs who have made millions by inventing a better microchip . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone forever . Says Young : " If the headlines are good for three or four days running and people are feeling optimistic , business picks right up . It 's good for at least a few cars . "
