For sale : five huge American shopping centers , from New Jersey to Washington State , and 691 stores spread all over the country , including the famed Brooks Brothers and Bonwit Teller chains . No retailing experience necessary . Foreigners welcome . <P> Giant Allied Stores never ran such an ad and never planned to sell itself off  --  certainly not to a Canadian real estate company . But last week , after resisting for two months , New York City-based Allied ( 1985 sales : $4.1 billion ) agreed to become a subsidiary of Toronto 's comparatively tiny Campeau Corp . ( 1985 revenues : $155 million ) . The price tag of $3.6 billion made it the biggest Canadian takeover of a U.S. corporation in history . While Allied executives were a bit stunned , Campeau 's chairman , Robert Campeau , was unabashedly delighted . " It 's the best deal I 've ever made in my life ! " he said . " It 's a terrific company , everything I want . " <P> Once unknown in the U.S. , Campeau is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming across the border with bundles of cash and a sharp eye for lucrative opportunities . The invaders range from hit-and-run investors mainly interested in fast profits to empire builders who have put down deep roots in the U.S. As the money pours into stores , skyscrapers and factories , capital has suddenly become the most visible Canadian export to the States since ice hockey . <P> Department of Commerce figures show that Canada 's direct investment in the U.S. surged from $11.4 billion in 1983 to $16.7 billion in 1985 . That total places Canada fourth among foreign investors in the U.S. , behind Britain , the Netherlands and Japan . The current value of American companies and other assets in which Canadians hold at least a 10% stake is even more impressive : $105.6 billion . Toronto 's Reichmann brothers , for example , now own 8% of all the office space in Manhattan . Last March a subsidiary of Vancouver-based B.C.E. Development bought $1 billion worth of real estate in five U.S. cities , including 13% of the office space in downtown Minneapolis . Other Canadian investors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineries . <P> Canadians put money into the U.S. for many of the same reasons that other foreign investors are drawn to the dynamic $4 trillion American economy : high return on capital , low taxes and skilled labor . What is more , the targets in America are tantalizingly close across the 5,526-mile border . Although Canada is larger than the U.S. , its economy is smaller than California 's , and its population , at 25 million , is roughly the size of the Golden State 's . Furthermore , 24% of the relatively small pool of Canadian assets is already owned by foreign investors . Americans alone own 45% of Canada 's oil and gas industry and 29% of its manufacturing sector . Says Ted Zahavich , director of research for Investment Canada , a federal agency in Ottawa that fosters foreign investment : " The U.S. is attractive to Canadian investors because there are limited opportunities in Canada for the big players . They 've outgrown the playpen . "                  @ @ @
