Since the majority of Canadians live only a few hours ' drive from the 4 , 000-mile border , they soak up US election-year rituals through the osmosis of television with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. // Their curiosity is aroused because the US election process is both familiar and foreign. // Skeptical by nature , Canadians lack their neighbors ' appetite for prolonged , expensive political road shows . In Canada , a 60-day election campaign , without the year-long preamble of American primaries and caucuses , is more than enough for Canadian voters , who do not share the American thirst for political heroes. // Canadians spent less on their 1984 national election than the $22 million price tag for one US Senate seat in California two years later. // And yet , in a country so chauvinistic about its democratic values , American politicians spend vast amounts of time and money wooing voters to surprisingly little effect. // In the 1984 presidential election , 53 percent of those registered turned out , compared with 75 percent of all Canadian voters who went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory . To an outsider , the unsettling thought is that so few Americans determine the economic fate of their fellow North Americans. // Even if US voters are turned off , Canadians have little choice but to tune in to the American political scene . Like the rider on a tandem bicycle , Canada is pedaling along with the US - even if the American cyclist rarely notices . Whether they like it or not , and often they do not , Canadians feel all the bumps when the American rider hits a rock in the road . As the US presidential race unfolds , Canadians watch with some anxiety , uncertain about just where the US is headed. // From a northern perspective , Canada will judge the expected fall showdown between Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis on how well they answer , in the affirmative , these three questions : // * Will the US get its economic house in order and regain its former preeminence ? // * Will the impending Canada-US free trade agreement lead to better bilateral relations ? // * Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain accord with Canada ? // Like many American voters , Canadians regard the race this fall as a choice between continuity and change , after eight years of Ronald Reagan ' s ' ' feel good ' ' economics. // Economic thunderclouds // Though the US economy keeps chugging along in the longest peacetime recovery in more that 40 years , the next president will ignore at his peril - and that of others - the warning shots from last October ' s stock market crash . Payment on the twin bills of high US budget and trade deficits , for example , are already overdue . But neither Mr. Bush , the world ' s most famous funeral-goer , nor Mr. Dukakis , author of the self-proclaimed ' ' Massachusetts miracle , ' ' offer much insight into how they will pay the bills. // Just as Americans show signs of uneasiness about the decline of US economic power and prestige , Canadians worry , too , for their own reasons . The short , sharp cries of economic nationalism heard in the presidential campaign this spring sparked Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither the vice-president nor the Massachusetts governor shows much sign of going that route , but if the US trade deficit remains intractably high , the next president will be under more domestic pressure to get tough on foreigners. // Lowering trade barriers // That is where the free-trade question , so politically charged in Canada , comes into play . Assuming that the legislatures in both countries ratify the bilateral trade accord later this year , Canada will be swept ever closer into the American orbit. // For Americans , the risks and rewards of lifting tariff and other trade restrictions with Canada over a 10-year period beginning Jan. 1 , 1989 , have barely registered , least of all as a campaign issue this fall . In Canada , where voters may go to the polls in a free-trade election this autumn , the debate is an all-consuming passion. // The Mulroney government has staked its political life on good relations with the Reagan administration , arguing that a formal trade agreement will force the US to pay more attention to its biggest market. // For Canadians , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they both endorse the trade deal and , as energy-poor New Englanders , know the importance of power exports from Canada . But judging from the last four years , when Mr. Mulroney practiced ' ' pals ' ' diplomacy with Mr. Reagan , there are real limits to the politics of friendship alone . The US president still plays hardball when his domestic interests are at stake. // Acid rain // As with free trade , the acid-rain question looms large for Canadians , if not for American voters this year . After years of Reagan administration foot-dragging on Canada ' s demand for an acid-rain accord , Dukakis looks like a promising alternative to Bush . As governor of a New England state suffering the environmental damage of acid rain , Mr. Dukakis undoubtedly will be more sympathetic than Mr. Reagan , who first blamed ' ' killer trees ' ' for the problem . But the next president ' s willingness to sign an acid-rain treaty with Canada still rests on the US ' s finding its own solution to the regionally-divisive air-pollution problem. // When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one group of spectators will be rooting from the northern bleachers . Though they may be disappointed , Canadians hope the two would-be presidents will debate each other on the environment , trade , and the future of the American economy - issues in which Canada has a vested interest . With luck , whoever wins in November will understand that the US shares a border with a country other than Mexico. // //
