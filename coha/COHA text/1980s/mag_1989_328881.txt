FROM BEIRUT TO JERUSALEM by Thomas L. Friedman <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 525 pages ; $22.95 <P> Ten years as a journalist in Lebanon and Israel taught Thomas L. Friedman two important lessons . " First , when it comes to discussing the Middle East , people go temporarily insane , so if you are planning to talk to an audience of more than two , you 'd better have mastered the subject . Second , a Jew who wants to make a career working in or studying about the Middle East will always be a lonely man : he will never be fully accepted or trusted by the Arabs , and he will never be fully accepted or trusted by the Jews . " <P> That last clause will raise some eyebrows and hackles , but Friedman , who has mastered his subject , fully documents its accuracy . During most of the 1980s he covered the Middle East for the New York Times , initially as bureau chief in Beirut and then in the same post in Jerusalem . In Lebanon , Friedman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Israel he was not . Solitude had its comforts , he found . " People assumed that if you were in Beirut you could n't possibly be Jewish , " he writes . " After all , what Jew in his right mind would come to Beirut ? " But members of his faith knew what Friedman was , and some were quick to interpret fact finding as heresy or treason . Why ? The author answers , " I had helped to inform the Jews of New York City of the less-than-heroic behavior of the Israeli army in Lebanon , the Sabra and Shatila massacre and other unsettling stories . " <P> Other readers placed a different value on Friedman 's dispatches . His reporting from Lebanon won him a Pulitzer Prize , and his subsequent work in Israel won him another . Friedman , 36 , is the Times 's chief diplomatic correspondent in Washington . Freed from daily deadlines , he can look back on a period punctuated by excitement and narrow escapes . He had not been in Beirut long before the apartment house in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his stay in Jerusalem , as he was being driven to a farewell lunch by his wife , his car windshield was shattered by a thrown rock . Such experiences add dizzying moments to Friedman 's crowded , fascinating memoir . <P> Among its many virtues , From Beirut to Jerusalem shows why messengers from the Middle East who try to remain impartial will find many factions eager to throttle them . The place lives and dies on faith and mythology ; a mere fact is useless , possibly dangerous , until it has been modified to fit within a dogma . Most of the region 's bloodiest episodes during the ' 80s , the author argues , arose from failures to recognize complex realities . <P> To say that powerful people in the Middle East sometimes behave irrationally is to flirt with the obvious . But Friedman buttresses this familiar thesis with fresh , arresting details . He chronicles the mounting debacle of Israel 's 1982 invasion of Lebanon , which began with the announced goal of ending the safe haven enjoyed by Yasser Arafat and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was almost easy , since a lot of Lebanese also wanted to get rid of the P.L.O . The Israeli soldiers were welcomed as saviors : " Everywhere you went in Lebanon , Jews were getting their pictures taken . This was not a nation at war , it was a nation on tour .
