Despite official assurances that all is smooth sailing ahead , barge industry executives aren ' t the only ones worried that federal budget cutbacks could scuttle the excellent safety record set by twoboat and barge operators . The same concern is being voiced by individuals within the three federal agencies most directly responsible for barge transportation : the US Coast Guard , the Environmental Protection Agency , and the US Army Corps of Engineers. // The official view put forward by industry and government spokesman is that risks are inevitable when dealing with 20 or 30 giant bulk barges lashed together into tows up to 1 , 200 feet long , 200 feet wide , carrying 40 , 000 tons of cargo  --  but that the industry ' s low accident rate proves the risks are being dealt with effectively. // Both industry and government point out that a towboat operator is bound to take all possible measures to handle his tow safely when the total worth of his equipment and cargo can add up to $30 million. // Along with the natural economic incentive to protect valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent regulations enforced by the US Coast Guard. // But many see storm clouds moving in from Washington . Forecasts point to a doubling in barge traffic over the next 20 that the industry ' s low accident rate proves the risks are being dealt with effectively. // Both industry and government point out that a towboat operator is bound to take all possible measures to handle his tow safely when the total worth of his equipment and cargo can add up to $30 million. // Along with the natural economic incentive to protect valuable cargo and vessels , operators are kept on course by stringent regulations enforced by the US Coast Guard. // But many see storm clouds moving in from Washington . Forecasts point to a doubling in barge traffic over the next 20 years . Yet over the past four years the Carter administration has exerted steady pressure to reduce spending on various waterways programs. // Coast Guard officers fought Washington-impose cutbacks which reduced their buoy inventories , reduced their ship numbers , dissolved the Towing Industry Advisory Committee , and from July 15 to 25 this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans. // The VTS has been reinstated . A ship collision resulting in a PCB chemical spill when the VTS was shut down may have convinced budget-cutters that this one-way traffic system on the Mississippi is worth its $2 million annual cost. // The Coast Guard also had the cutback on is spare buoy numbers reversed  --  and within the next few months hopes to be back to a " safe " level . Legislation is expected to be passed shortly to re-create the disbanded Towing Industry Advisory Committee to provide a channel for regular contact between the industry and the Coast Guard. // Coast Guard officers say they have learned to live with fewer buoy tenders by setting up a priority system for replacing the most important buoys knocked out by high water or collisions . They now rely on towboat operators to report missing buoys  --  and warn river users to not to expect the 60 percent of channel buoys lost each year to be replaced as quickly as in the past. // Commander Alexander Tanos , Commanding officer of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office and Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems for his district , which stretches from St. Paul , Minn. , to Baton Rouge , La . But he does wonder about the future saying , " the more density of shipping you have , the more increase in hazards. " // Army Corps of Engineers officers also see hazards increasing if Traffic increases while budgets are cut . One officer reported that " We ' ve had quite a few groundings . . . some of which might not have occurred if we had been able to dredge as we used to . " He and other Army engineers said cutbacks in the $300 million per year dredging program resulted from a combination of factors . Money ran short this year due to higher fuel prices and emergency dredging needed to deal with shoaling caused by ash from Mt . St. Helen and by Hurricane Allen. // Also , state and environmental restrictions have made it more expensive , and in some cases impossible , to find disposal sites for the spoils dredged from rivers and harbors. // Congressman Mario Biaggi ( D ) of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing barge traffic poses a major safety problem. // " Barges improperly cared for or improperly operated , " he told the Monitor , " have the potential for turning into infernos which are perils to the public . " He recognizes that budget cutbacks are popular today , but added that " if there weren ' t cuts , the elements of safety would be enhance and would be enhanced further with additional funding. " // Capt . Thomas Rutledge , chief of operations for the Second Coast Guard District , based in St. Louis , believes that the barge industry has tremendous potential because of its excellent safety record and because " this is one of the few areas where we can greatly improve the nation ' s transportation resources without great expense. " // Currently the industry cites a six-year-old Arthur D. Little study as proof of its safety record . This report focuses narrowly on hazardous cargoes , and doesn ' t make valid comparisons with other modes of transport , according to Luigi Colucciello , chief of the marine accident division of the National Transportation Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that barges show a good safety record according to " the human exposure index . " Their routes keep them far from major population centers . But he added , " If water pollution is the issue , then barges could be the most hazardous mode. " // Industry and government officials agree that great advances have been made in barge safety . Regular Coast Guard inspections of equipment are backed up by powers of boarding and seizure and fines of up to $25 , 000 along with the far more costly requirement that operators must clean up all spills . More and more barges are being built with double-skin hulls . Increased horsepower gives modern towboats more control in swift currents. // Operators skills have been improved by tough new licensing requirements and the Coast Guard ' s power to revoke licenses ( " which we do every day , " said one New Orleans officer . ) There have been constant efforts to improve radio communications , training of crews , and navigation aids. // //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
