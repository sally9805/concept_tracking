Until last week , many Wall Street investors thought the fun was over . The extraordinary bull-market surge that began last September seemed to have sputtered as of April 21 , when the Dow Jones industrial average hit a peak at 1855.90 . Between then and May 19 , the Dow plunged 97.72 points , to 1758.18 , losing more than 5% of its value . But when Wall Streeters returned to their command posts , computer terminals and telephone consoles after the Memorial Day hiatus , they happily resumed some unfinished business : a dizzying bull- market comeback . <P> The first sign of a rebound came in the two trading days before the holiday , May 22 and 23 , when the Dow jumped a total 48.12 , to 1823.29 . Since Wall Street customarily quiets down before a long weekend , many investors had to scramble to take part in the sudden rise . " There 's no doubt it caught them absolutely by surprise , " said Eugene Lerner , a professor of finance at Northwestern University and president of a Chicago investment-management firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks prompted traders to hang on to their investments over the weekend rather than sell them off to lock in profits . The mood was still ebullient when the market reopened . The Dow leaped 29.74 on Tuesday and 25.25 on Wednesday to a record 1878.28 . The unprecedented four-day rise was 103.11 , which more than recouped the index 's recent losses . The Dow inched ahead 4.07 on Thursday to set another record close and then slipped back 5.64 on Friday to end the week at 1876.71 . <P> Many investors believe that the market is now taking off on another leg of its stampede toward the 2000 mark . Says Thomas Kelley , chairman of BankAmerica 's investment-management subsidiary , which handles about $15 billion : " It was so obvious the market was going to come back . " Notes Richard Goforth , a broker for the Los Angeles investment firm Crowell , Weedon : " People feel like we 're in a good bull market that 's going to last for another year or so . " <P> The latest rally seemed all the more remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a sudden drop in interest rates or oil prices . Instead , investors took heart in expectations of robust economic growth this year and an anticipated rise in corporate profits . They were reassured about their hunch later in the week when the Commerce Department reported that its index of leading indicators , the Government 's primary gauge for forecasting business trends , jumped 1.5% in April ; it was the best performance since October 1983 . Said David Wyss , an economist with the Data Resources forecasting firm : " Now that we 've had three months in a row of strong increases , that 's very good news for the summer economy . " President Reagan , in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers , hailed the statistic as a signal of " good times ahead . "
