When Paul Simon , Peter Gabriel and Talking Heads sell millions of records using Jamaican reggae and South African mbaqanga , their sources deserve a piece of the action . But to reach the world audience , how much will those regional musicians have to change - and for better or for worse ? // Musical ideas from outside the United States and Britain are obviously here to stay . Amnesty International ' s Human Rights Now tour , scheduled to begin Friday in London , expects to fill arenas with a bill featuring Sting and Mr. Gabriel - who ' ve borrowed from all over the world , particularly Africa and the Caribbean - as well as Youssou N ' Dour , the Senegalese singer who ' s a superstar in French-speaking West Africa , and who has recorded and toured with Mr. Gabriel . ( Bruce Springsteen and Tracy Chapman are also on the tour . ) When Bob Marley proved that an international superstar could arise from the Third World , and Sting , Mr. Gabriel , and other British and American performers ( Joni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) started globe-hopping and ransacking ethnic-music record bins over the last decade , they opened doors for performers from places rock had treated as the boondocks. // Musical revelations arrived from West Africa , from Brazil , from Eastern Europe , from the Middle East and from isolated American communities like Cajun and Tex-Mex country . Pop critics became amateur ethnomusicologists , independent record companies started snapping up foreign-made recordings , and somebody coined the term " world beat " for everything with a touch of the exotic . If some commercial radio station hasn ' t already started a " world beat " format - segueing Led Zeppelin ' s " Kashmir " into a song from Yemen ' s Ofra Haza , or following Talking Heads ' s " Nothing But Flowers " with something by Zaire ' s Kanda Bongo Man - it can ' t be far away. // But now the messy part begins , as the magnetic pull of the potential American market begins to bend the music . One of the joys of running across Mercedes Sosa from Argentina or Salif Keita from Mali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weren ' t thinking about a North American public . Amid all those rockers intent on saturation radio exposure , what a relief ! // Long before I ' d heard about them , Ms. Sosa and Mr. Keita had become pop stars on their own continents . They weren ' t ethnomusicological discoveries playing just for neighbors in some remote village ; they were used to addressing a large audience , and probably well aware of the American Top 40 that ricochets around the world . But the idea of crafting songs to appeal to an English-speaking Madonna or Phil Collins fan was no priority ; first , they had to reach the home folks. // Put a musician like that on the international circuit , though , and things can change . Away from home , a musician can no longer count on listeners recognizing anything but the surface of a song - not the language , not the performer ' s own past , not the musical style or the layers of tradition behind it. // When the Bhundu Boys from Zimbabwe came to the Central Park Bandshell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keyboard lines in intoxicating , three-against-two rhythm patterns , I ' d guess that only a minority of the audience knew that those patterns came from traditional songs originally plinked out on mbiras ( thumb pianos ) and balafons ( marimbas ) , much less which traditional songs ; more likely , they were reminded of the carousel across the park. // Placed before a foreign audience , the music has already changed - it ' s no longer a community celebration , but a marvelous curiosity . Where Zimbabweans might hear the Bhundu Boys ( " bush " boys ) as folk-rockers , plugging in traditional tunes to create what they call " jit " music , New Yorkers hear exotic African music , intricate and mysterious. // The difference between the Bhundu Boys ' 1986 album , " Shabini " ( Carthage/DiscAfrique Afri LP 02X ) and their new one , " True Jit " ( Mango MLPS 9812 ) is the difference between a band working at home and one that , as of last year , had become a sensation by touring Britain ( including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The songs on " Shabini , " which was recorded in Harare , the capital of Zimbabwe , are all in the Shona language ; half the songs on " True Jit , " recorded in London with technically improved sound , are in earthbound English. // " Shabini " relies on the Bhundu Boys ' guitars ; " True Jit " adds a British horn section . And where " Shabini " revolves around Zimbabwean mbira rhythms , " True Jit " mixes in some South African jive and West African soukous , moving toward pan-African music . At the same time , the Bhundu Boys recognize that their exotic origins don ' t hurt : " Back in the bhundu is where we are from , " are the first words they sing on the self-consciously titled " True Jit. " // For Youssou N ' Dour , the before-and-after contrast was even more striking . When he first came to New York , playing for a predominantly Senegalese audience at the Ritz , he wore white desert-style robes and sang with almost mystical fervor as his 10-piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythms . After touring the world with Peter Gabriel , he returned to the Beacon Theater in a mock-military , red-gold-and-green outfit , strutting like a Western rock singer before a band of only six musicians , but still in remarkable voice . According to his manager , his new American record company wants to market Mr. N ' Dour as an African singer rather than a Senegalese one , which seems to mean that some of the local trappings have to go. // It ' s not fair to simply cry , " Sellout ! " The Bhundu Boys and Mr. N ' Dour are playing popular music , itself in constant evolution ; local and outside influences have been tangled for decades , maybe centuries . As the musicians see more of the world , they ' re bound to incorporate the rhythms and ideas they now live with . Beyond that , most popular music means to be hospitable , and one way to make listeners feel at home is to give them something they ' re familiar with , whether it ' s a few words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the funk song that brings a cheer in concert can sound like a bad imitation and a waste of time on the turntable. // It ' s easy to go too far toward internationalism . Ladysmith Black Mambazo , the glorious South African choir , can now be heard in a soda-pop commercial . The Gipsy Kings came to town billed as a flamenco-fusion group with genuine Andalusian singer-guitarists , all the rage in Paris ; in person , singing weepy pop boleros , they sounded like Julio Iglesias plus a half-dozen guitars . Reggae singers regularly make their way to the British pop charts with covers of American and British pop songs better forgotten than revived . Toure Kunda , three Senegalese brothers now headquartered in Paris , sound less African with every tour as they dabble in reggae , in Latin-rock , in pop ; they begin to approach the international dilettantism of big-city rockers from Europe and the United States. // It would be a double standard to suggest that Paul Simon and Sting can borrow whatever they want while their sources have to stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only provide raw material for the empire ' s factories. // For the moment , I ' m sure that some of the current music that sounds diluted and assimilated will turn out to be the result of growing pains - and that sooner or later , the best world-beat bands will bring what they ' ve learned back home . At the turn of the 1970 ' s , two of Brazil ' s leading songwriters , Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil , were exiled to England , where they picked up rock and roll and launched the Brazilian pop movement called tropicalia . The first records they made were pitiful , awkward attempts to merge rock and bossa nova , almost painfully klutzy - but by the end of the 1970 ' s , they were leading bands that are effortlessly internationalist and unmistakably Brazilian. // In the French Antilles , the band Kassav ' started out by superimposing a local rhythm atop a disco beat , in records that sounded like cheesy tourist novelties ; a decade later , their streamlined , electronically driven zouk ( party ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean , Africa and Europe. // The Bhundu Boys , Youssou N ' Dour and some of the other newcomers to international pop haven ' t made any final statements - and it will be up to them whether they ' re remembered as stateless pop bands or national standard-bearers. //
