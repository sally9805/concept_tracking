At first glance , Herbert Cantley of Huntingdon Valley , Pa. , seems an unexceptional 46-year-old man who earns an honest living renovating and painting houses . But that is only his latest career . Last year he was fired from his job as a sales manager at the Philadelphia office of Shearson Lehman Bros. , a New York-based brokerage firm , after authorities began investigating % large unreported currency transactions at the company . Last week that investigation finished with a flourish : a federal grand jury indicted Shearson Lehman , Cantley and six other people on charges of laundering $1.2 million for an illegal gambling syndicate . <P> The 63-count indictment alleges that between September 1982 and July 1985 Cantley and five of his accomplices , including Joseph Vito Mastronardo Jr. , the son-in-law of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo , operated a $1 million-a-week , five-state gambling ring . They hid their profits , the indictment states , by changing cash into bank checks and money orders , which then made their way into numerous Shearson accounts . The funds were mostly used to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gambling proceeds by putting them into legitimate investments . <P> In a rare move , the grand jury charged that Shearson managers and employees knew about the money-laundering scheme . Now a subsidiary of American Express , Shearson is also accused of violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act , which requires that financial institutions report to the Internal Revenue Service all cash transactions in excess of $10,000 . If convicted , Shearson faces a maximum fine of more than $16 million . While several banks have been charged with money laundering , it is unusual for a brokerage firm to be indicted for that offense . <P> Shearson denied all charges . A prepared statement called the indictment " unprecedented . . . an unfortunate abuse of prosecutorial discretion . " The firm said that Cantley was a " disloyal former employee " and that if he and his associates had broken any laws , they did so in " violation of Shearson Lehman 's own policies . " Through his attorney , Cantley asserted his innocence . If convicted , the former broker could be sentenced to 198 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly improves the tarnished reputation of Wall Street dealmakers . Last year E.F . Hutton pleaded guilty to a check-kiting scheme . The Securities and Exchange Commission said in May that it had cracked the largest insider-trading case ever : the $12.6 million scam allegedly engineered by Dennis Levine , a former managing director at Drexel Burnham . The Shearson indictment is the latest chapter in a continuing saga of Wall Street scandal . No one is calling it the last .
