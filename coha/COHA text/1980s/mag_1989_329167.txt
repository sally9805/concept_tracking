Psyllium is not exactly a household staple , but the obscure grain has provoked a kitchen-table brawl between General Mills and Procter &; Gamble . Psyllium contains soluble fiber , which has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels . The grain is an ingredient in Benefit , a new breakfast cereal General Mills introduced in May . Psyllium is also found in Metamucil , one of P &G's; fiber laxatives . But while General Mills is allowed to advertise that Benefit helps to reduce cholesterol , P &G; is forbidden to make the same claim for its laxative unless it can get FDA approval , which P &G; has tried but failed to get so far . <P> P &G; has urged the FDA to order the cereal off the market . But General Mills , which has limited Benefit 's sales mostly to the Midwest , intends to fight back . Says a spokesman : " There 's no question that it 's a food and not a drug . It 's packaged like a cereal , it looks like a cereal , and it 's sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
