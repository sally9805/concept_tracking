For weeks Manila has been rife with speculation over where armed forces Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos would stand in the event of a showdown between President Corazon Aquino and her restive Defense Minister , Juan Ponce Enrile . While most observers have put the general in Aquino 's camp , his support of some of Enrile 's positions has made him difficult to read . Last week , confronted by reports that members of the military were planning a coup , Ramos sternly warned " military adventurists " that such action could be " bloody and destabilizing . " Declared the general , in his clearest show of support yet for Aquino 's fragile government : " It 's vital that we safeguard and enhance the gains of the February revolution . " <P> Ramos ' no-nonsense message came as Aquino prepared for a four-day trip to Japan this week . The President seemed unfazed by the coup rumors  --  and Enrile 's persistent opposition . Ignoring his calls for immediate presidential elections , she set Feb. 2 as the date for a plebiscite on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . She announced that legislative elections would be held next May 11 . At midweek government negotiators reopened talks with Communist rebels , an Aquino initiative that Enrile has sharply criticized . Only one day earlier , Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin of Manila had publicly endorsed Aquino 's peace feelers . Said he : " Our faith will tell us to give peace a chance . " <P> Along with Enrile , Ramos spearheaded the weekend rebellion that toppled former President Ferdinand Marcos last February . He took action after the Philippine newspaper Business Day quoted " high-level " military sources as saying that disaffected military men planned an operation , code-named " God Save the Queen , " to purge the Aquino government of " left-leaning elements " while retaining Aquino as President . The coup was to take place before the Feb. 2 referendum . <P> Spokesmen for Enrile , who kept a low public profile last week , denied knowledge of any plot against the government . In fact the Defense Minister 's supporters argued that in a crisis the general would have to follow the sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ramos is loyal to his commander in chief  --  and that should be interpreted to mean whoever that may be , " said a Defense Ministry aide . Aquino , who met briefly with Enrile at week 's end , brushed aside the prospects of a coup , though she put the military on full alert . " I 'm confident that there will not be a coup , " she said . <P> Still , Ramos ' support for Aquino 's policies is hedged with qualifications . He shares Enrile 's skepticism about the government 's conciliatory approach toward the guerrillas of the Communist New People 's Army . Indeed , as preliminary negotiations with the rebels ended last week , the prospects for reduced hostilities remained clouded . While the two sides agreed on safety and immunity guarantees that would operate during a limited cease-fire , proposed two weeks ago by the insurgents , they disagreed sharply over the duration of the truce . " The rebel proposal and that of the military are worlds apart , " said a Philippines armed forces strategist .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
