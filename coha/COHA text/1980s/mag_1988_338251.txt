" CROCODILE " DUNDEE II <P> It was all so simple the first time around . Find a natural man and bring him to the big city where he can teach the slickers a thing or two about the continuing validity of the simple values like courage , modesty , an equable temperament and a straightforward definition of right and wrong . It was a little like watching Mr. Smith go to Washington or Mr. Deeds go to town . Except that Mick ( " Crocodile " ) Dundee ( Paul Hogan ) not only spoke softly but also carried this enormous Australian bush knife , particularly useful in cutting through useless conversations . <P> " Crocodile " Dundee II reverses the formula by sending the natural man back to nature , an idea that has the virtue of originality but can be executed only with much tedious maneuvering . For some reason Hogan and his son Brett , who co-wrote the script , have decided that their heavies should be a ring of Colombian drug dealers . They have to be manipulated to New York City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick 's perpetually adoring girlfriend . Then an unlikely band of citizens has to be recruited to help him rescue her . Then the criminals must be lured all the way to Australia so that Mick can prove what we already know : that their street smarts are no match for his outback smarts . Then , then , then . It 's a little like listening to a child improvise a tall tale ; the innocent charm quickly wears thin . <P> There are some sweet moments : Mick 's casual rescue of a suicidal jumper from a skyscraper ledge ; a momentary alliance with some Japanese tourists who prove to be funnily adept at karate ; a friendship with a black man determined to project a menacing image , though he is actually a peaceable stationery salesman . But the film 's many narrative obligations keep interrupting the consistent development of a lively comic-adventure pace and tone . John Cornell makes a diffident first-time director , unable to punch up a scene or a performance  --  especially Hogan 's . And Hogan is so determined to underplay his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
