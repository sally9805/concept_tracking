UNTMARWS HAPPY ENDING A story by Jane Hamilton N THE MORNINGS Aunt Marji often came downstairs without her glasses , tripping over pieces of lint in the carpet and grab-bing for things a mile before they were within reach . She of-ten said things like , " Did you see my mother walking down the road earlier ? J ca n't think where she 's going . " When Alberta would softly say , " Aunt Marji , you know your mother has been dead for years , " Aunt Marji usually slapped her own head and cried out , " Great Scott , that 's right . I must be off my rocker . " Alberta tried to explain to Aunt Marji that it was n't necessary to put more than a squirt or two of Joy into the dishwater , but Aunt Marji could n't remember , and each night there were suds clinging to the rinsed dishes , like warts to a toad . That was one of the small things that exasperated Alberta . " It 's so wasteful , " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm in Wisconsin . Her story " My Own Earth " appeared in the November 1982 issue of Harper 's . Jack . " And all those phosphates or whatever . " But Jack only said , " Never mind , she enjoys washing dishes . Just let her enjoy it . " Jack and Alberta had been married for two years , and Jack 's Aunt Marji had lived with them for the last three months . She could n't live by herself anymore . Things happened . For instance , she frequently called her lawyer at four in the morning ; she closed and opened her bank accounts in all the banks in town every other day , because they were cheating her ; she thought she was too poor to buy bananas and hamburger and was living on powdered milk and spongy white bread ; she could n't find her glasses and got lost in her own house ; she had no sneakers without holes in them and was too embarrassed to go outside ? everything short of burning the house down , this was Aunt Marji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own teeth , knocking her head with a fist , saying , " If I had a hammer I could bust this skull of mine open and see what 's going on in there . I know something 's wrong  --  to tell you the truth , I think I 've lost a marble or two . " Alzheimer 's disease , the doctor had 57 said . Then Aunt Marji would laugh and knock at her head again , " In two shakes of a dead lamb 's tail I 'm going to be my old self . " Having Aunt Marji was not as hard as Alberta anticipated . She was still the independent sort who even in senility did n't want to make trouble , and she was handy with food and the vacuum . Jack and Alberta would laugh secretly at her metaphors and misnomers . " Yesterday , " Alberta told Jack , " Aunt Marji was trying to unclog the washing-machine hose and she said she felt like she was looking up a double-barreled sword . " To go to town with Alberta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet feathers and a black coat with pink stitching up and down every border . And then her new red sneakers . Alberta said in bed one night , " She 's pretty cute . Where do you suppose she bought her getups ? " Jack explained that Aunt Marji had always been ahead of her time in the clothing department , making fashion statements with items from bargain basements and garage sales . " She was especially  --  flamboyant , " he added , " during the years she worked as the church receptionist . " ACK had always wanted to have a farm in Wisconsin . He was born in Wisconsin but his parents were killed in a train accident when he was six . Without reconsideration , Aunt Marji and Uncle James adopted Jack and he went to live in Ohio , outside of Toledo . He had wanted to be a farmer since he was seven , when his Uncle James gave him the Farm Set , with durable plastic cows and sheep and pasture fences . When he was eight , outside of Toledo , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into loose bails and then wrapped them up with string and stored them in the garage for his livestock . When he was fifteen , Aunt Marji helped him send away for literature on reputable agriculture schools , and later drove him to the University of Wisconsin for his first year , the box of homemade cookies and jars of wild-grape jelly sitting between them on the front seat . It was Aunt Marji who , only four years ago with all her wits , had lent him some of the money to buy the farm . Now , all of his life mortgaged , he milked his fleshand-blood cows of his dreams . He hugged Alberta in the night , even his legs embracing her knees , and he kissed first her eyebrows and then the lids of her brown eyes . He had worried at first because he knew that two women in one kitchen were supposed to court trouble , serious trouble . Jack had had a dream that they hurtled saucepans back and forth , like a game of grade schooldodge ball  --  with the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ordinary things , like the sun coming up , and Alberta , a bookkeeper and organizer by nature and profession , seemed like sisters . They gave each other household hints . Alberta , who actually hated to do laundry , was pleased , working on her accounts in the bedroom , humming to herself , knowing that Aunt Marji was hanging up the dishtowels and sheets on the clothesline . Every evening Aunt Marji told them about fooling her little brother when she was young . She sat on a nest in the chicken coop and said to her brother , " Everyone thinks hens lay eggs but it 's really me . Hens are just decorative . " She would reach under her rump and produce an elongated double yoker , Because Jack and Alberta had heard the story so many times they did n't have to listen anymore . They knew when to laugh and during the pregnant pauses they could exchange pleasantries . " Aunt Marji , " Jack had explained to Alberta before she arrived from Ohio , " ca n't hear very well anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? " Alberta had said , " Fine . " Alberta thought that maybe it worked both ways , however . Once , while Aunt Marji was shelling popcorn , the neighbor Sandy confessed to Alberta in a corner of the room that she wanted to get Wally Ricelager into the woods and kiss him everywhere : elbows , balding head , kneecaps , navel . Aunt Marji looked across the room to the polished doorknob , her eyes magnified one hundred times by her thick bifocals , and smiled a crooked , sweet smile . Later , at supper , she asked Alberta if Sandy enjoyed walking in the woods . But when Alberta explained to Aunt Marji about using a chamber pot if she needed to in the night , because the bathroom was on the first floor , Aunt Marji squawked at her and blinked uncomprehendingly . So , night after night , Aunt Marji woke them up , banging her door open and tripping down the stairs in the wooden shoes her husband had given her . UNT MARJI spent her days reading Reader 's Digests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making jam , often forgetting to add sugar . Alberta did bookkeeping for Jack and the upholsterer in town and two restaurants . Alberta , who in her teens swore that she would never marry and certainly not reproduce , wanted to have a child in the foreseeable future . In her freshman year at the university , Economics 100 , Alberta had watched Jack , a junior , from the back row . He had short hair that she suspected he cut himself , and he usually wore green work shirts , which made his gray eyes look green . She would wait for him to turn and watch the clock so she 58 could study his profile ; she found his thin straight nose , his small ears , and his lips especially beautiful . It took them a year of grinning at each other to finally meet , to finally shake hands . After two months of sitting side by side through movies Alberta said , " Hey , Jack , let 's kiss . " He stood still , waiting for her to come toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed . Now , in the middle of the night , he would pull her toward him and whisper in her ear ; she guessed it was like tapping on the neighbors ' windows to see if they were all right . She often thought of him and of their romance during the day while she punched numbers into her adding machine . She had finished two years of business school while he fixed up the farmhouse for them , working the night shift at Nestle 's . She remembered how he picked her up at the.bus station and brought her to the house , and how she stood on the rotting steps with her hands over her cheeks , and how , when she shifted her weight , the stairs fell away from her and all the termites scattered from the broken boards . She lay on her back and started to cry because of her ankle , but all she could say was , " I love this , " over and over . She could n't help thinking about how he came into the kitchen these summer months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on underneath . He leaned against the sink drinking lemonade with his eyes closed and when she moved to touch him Aunt Marji would be at the door . Last week Aunt Marji had stood in the dark hallway saying , " Did you see my baby ? Someone just handed me a baby and they said it was mine . " Alberta , with one hand lingering at Jack 's waist , said , " Really ? " Aunt Marji scratched her stomach and said , " Why it had on yellow booties and they said it had a lot of hair for its age . " After Jack convinced her that she really could n't possibly have been pregnant she said , " I might as well just walk until my hat floats . " By the time they had it all settled Alberta did n't feel so amorous anymore . It was lunchtime ; she was hungry . T was out of the blue in late June that a friend from high school called Alberta and said she would like to come for a visit . Alberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little space there was for a guest ; she said , with a rush of affection for her old cheerleading cohort and the first person she had met when her family suddenly moved to Kansas , " Come visit , Nora . We have n't seen each other in  --  how long ? ? two years ? " At that Nora seemed to laugh or it might have been crying . Alberta heard only indecipherable rasps . Nora said finally , " Alberta , it 's so good to hear your voice . You would n't believe what I 've been through . I have n't written to you because too much has happened . " It turned out Nora was crying . Alberta learned that she was in love with a married man . When Alberta did n't say anything , out of surprise rather than disapproval , Nora blurted , " But it 's not like you think , he did n't marry for any of the right reasons ; it 's not a good match . He says he married Martha because he saw her in the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girls . That 's how he is . " Nora explained that it was very appropriate that the word " love " could be found somewhere in his name . She formed each consonant with slow deliberation , like a speech therapists as she said , " Philip Lovell . " And then , as if she were pleading for Alberta 's forgiveness , she said , " He grew up in North Dakota just like you , Alberta . He has your same vowels . You 'd like him so much . " Nora went on in a whisper , " Alberta , I 'm in trouble . The wife , Martha , says she 's going to kill me . First , for months she called me at all hours , laughing into the phone and then hanging up . Now she says she 's going to shoot me . I heard shots last night and I thought , I 've got to get out of here . I thought of you and the farm ; you 've always seen me through my hard times . " Alberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't need that kind of harassment ; you do n't deserve it . " She could n't help saying , " Come and see where Jack and I live  --  my husband , Jack . " At dinner Alberta told Jack the details . While Aunt Marji was roasting marshmallows over the electric stove Alberta said , " The wife called up Nora and said , ' I 've got a gun and I 'm going to kill you , you little slut . ' Is n't that awful ? " Jack stopped chewing and said , " What will she do here all day ? " He had been planning on working without interruption this week and now there would be a visitor . " I 'm not going to entertain her . She 's desperate ? she 'll hide , write poetry , I suppose ; that 's what poets do , is n't it ? " Jack had met Nora only once , at their July wedding . She was small and had dark curls all over her head , and he remembered how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she did n't approve of him for Alberta . They had stood next to each other for a full five minutes at the reception and because she did n't initiate conversation Jack found himself asking her extremely fatuous questions , such as , " What does your family do to celebrate the Fourth of . July ? " Her terse answer evoked baked beans and pickle relish . He wanted to ask her if her head had ever been used as a floor mop but there was Alberta , coming to save him , in all her blushing-bride beatitude . On the subject of visitors he now thought of saying to Alberta , remember when your parents came for lunch on their way up north ? She already seemed defensive about Nora so he did n't say anything but he had the urge to ask , are you sure you want an overnight guest ? The time her parents had stopped . Alberta was a little neurotic about pleasing her mother . She had gone to trouble over the luncheon , the table , the flowers ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her pockets . She had gone so far as to put new cupboard paper in the cabinets and to dust all the dishes . Alberta 's mother thought Aunt Marji spelled trouble , that much Jack knew . The day the parents came for lunch Aunt Marji was sure that her own mother was hiking up the road along with her sister Addy . Aunt Marji swore she saw them coming and she kept setting places for them , which Alberta took off the table behind her back . Alberta 's father talked to Jack about rototillers and trout fishing while Alberta 's mother sat at the head of the table without saying a word , all her muscles tense , picking through her food , because Aunt Marji could n't stop chattering about the long expected dead visitors . She was all aflutter waiting for them to come to the door . Alberta said afterward that she had never been so humiliated . She said her mother thought Aunt Marji was going to ruin Alberta 's marriage and no doubt her life as well . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no idea " and continued weeping . Later , dry-eyed and puffy , looking like an amphibian resigned to land , Alberta took a deep breath and said she did n't much care what her mother thought , and that Aunt Marji had a better sense of humor anyway . Aunt Marji came into the living room with marshmallows so Alberta did n't explain to Jack that she could not possibly have said no to Nora . Compared with Nora she felt rich and absolutely free from anxiety . Even with Aunt Marji and all the farm work , they had a fairly serene life , she and Jack , waiting each day for the mail to come , sitting in the kitchen , drinking coffee among all their gleaming copper-bottomed pans . Because lack had to get up at four-thirty to milk , they went to sleep at eight-thirty at night . At eight o'clock they got into bed and read Agatha Christie novels out loud for half an hour . Turning to Jack when he switched out the light she pictured the killer 's cumbersome hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the extent of terror in Alberta 's life . oRA ARRIvED at the end of the week with two lavender suit-cases , a large purse , and a shoulder bag  --  prepared , Jack thought , as he watched her from the soybean field , to visit for a lifetime . Alberta thought , if I lived in a rambling , seven-bedroom house by myself this would be fine , but it 's different now with Aunt Marji ; she 's not what the ordinary guest would expect to find . When Nora walked into the living room , where she was going to sleep , Aunt Marji was spreading out the seashells she had collected the time she had won the trip to Hawaii . - Great Scott , " Aunt Marji said . " Who 's this ? " Nora slopped in midstep , staring at Aunt Marji , whose white hair stood up on end like a dandelion gone to seed . Had Aunt Marji been sixty years younger she would have passed as a punk-rocker because she was wearing a silky magenta dress with safety pins holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good Lord , girl , do n't you have the sense to come in out of the rain ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . " It was an unfortunate beginning , Alberta thought , but not irrevocable . Aunt Marji laughed one of her belchlike laughs , and then crept around the living room whimpering " ouuuuuuuuuuuuu " up and down the scale . " No kidding , T feel like a ghost sometimes , hot diggity dog , maybe I am a ghost . " " This is my Aunt Marji , " Alberta said to Nora and Aunt Marji bowed in her best Japanese manner , hands together , bending straight from the waist , lips pursed , saying , " How do you do ? " To Alberta 's dismay Nora was frowning at Aunt Marji ; she looked worried as she set her lavender suitcases down and her eyes narrowed when she looked up , as if she were examining a lunatic who shot people indiscriminately . " Gosh-all-fishhooks , " Aunt Marji said to her shells on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mountain looking down at a bunch of nuns in their white habits ? Looks like a bunch of nuns filing into church . " " Sure it does , Aunt Marji , " Alberta said . " Do you know , " Aunt Marji said , turning to Nora , " that I won a trip to Hawaii down at the Eagle store when it first opened ? Imagine that . Seven days in Hawaii and they let me take Dolores too . Picked up these shells myself , scads of them on the beach ; funny if you think of them like toenails  --  that 's really what they 're Eke , just dead stuff that used to be attached to live creatures . Sure are pretty little toenails . " A look of consternation became fixed on Nora 's face . " Nora 's a poet , Aunt Marji , " Alberta said . Then quickly , before Aunt Marji could start reciting " Hiawatha " or telling about teaching in the last one-room school in Athens County , Alberta said , " I 'll show you around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went through the door Aunt Marji called after them , " I 've been in thirteen countries in Europe too . After James died . I remember it just like it was yesterday . " Later , when Alberta had gone to the grocery store , Jack stuck his head into the living room , 60 made a brief speech of welcome to Nora , who was sitting at the table , and then took to the kitchen , where he got out his wheat grinder and began assembling ingredients for bread baking . This was his job ; one he 'd coveted . He made dense , nutritious loaves that Alberta claimed could knock a robber senseless . Alberta had given Jack the electric grinder as a first-anniversary present and it was with satisfaction that he watched the wheat he had grown slip into the grinding chamber and emerge as flour . The whir of the machine was calming and low enough so that he could hear Nora in the living room , shuffling through papers , poems probably , Jack thought . Alberta had said that Nora had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yeast dissolve , Aunt Marji came tripping through the kitchen with her arms full of laundry and then , as was her way , crashed through the door into the living room . " Mind if I fold these in here ? " he heard Aunt Marji ask Nora . Nora said no in such a small way Jack almost missed it . Aunt Marji probably did n't even hear her because she sang out , " What do you have there ? A masterpiece ? " Jack held his breath for a moment and then started to laugh . " Well , I 'll just be real quiet , " Aunt Marji said . " There 's wind out there ; I had to get these towels before they sailed clear across the county . I 'm going to fold them for Alberta . Do you know they used to call her Bert when she was little ? I 've always been Marji . When I was little I was a real snot . Used to hide all day long in the top of a tree and read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all the day 's dishes waiting for me . Mercy , was I a little snot . " Watching the clock , Jack noticed that there were exactly three minutes , forty-two seconds of absolute silence . But there she was again , saying , " I 'm folding these for Alberta . It 'll be like a corsage of laundry for her . Did you know they used to call her Bert when she was little ? Imagine that . Nowdays I do n't do much . I 'm lazy , lazier than a codfish or a piece of bark . Been in eleven countries in Europe though . Say , do you talk much ? " Jack strained to hear ; as much as fifteen seconds passed without an audible response . He imagined Nora sitting at the table , studying her piece of paper and shaking her head so that all her curls became dislodged from their intended positions . He whispered into the refrigerator as he went after butter , " Go for it , Marji . " " Well , I 'm the biggest flirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care what they say , I 've still got my sense of humor . May not have any marbles and sometimes that makes me so mad I could just snort , but I can always laugh . " How 's that masterpiece ? " " It 's not a masterpiece , " Nora said , pushing the swinging door to the kitchen , surprising Jack , who was sniffing the yeast and honey . Because Jack suspected she might want an apology for Aunt Marji , he chose not to look at her and instead called out to Aunt Marji , " I 'll put the towels away . " He heard Nora slam the bathroom door , so he went into the living room to see if Aunt Marji wanted a milk shake . He did n't mean to look but he could n't help seeing the first line of Nora 's poem : " You will put golden beetles between my sheets . " " Golden beetles ? " he said out loud . " Chocolate rabbits , " Aunt Marji said to the stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits Alberta gave me for Christmas . " HEN ALBERTA came home from the grocery store , Nora told her that everything in her life was an intrusion , except Philip Lovell , of course . Sometimes , Nora explained , watching Alberta make tea , there were so many bodies next to hers , prodding her , jostling her , asking her questions , telling her how to get a job . To show Alberta what she did in the face of these intrusions , Nora put her thesis into Alberta 's wet hands , the thesis being proof that her way of coping was to retreat mentally back to her hometown , making poems of the beauticians and their kitchen timers ticking as you sat under the hair dryer . In this hook , she told Alberta , she marked her relationships from childhood to adulthood , and finally climbed into a swimming pool in Dubuque with Philip Lovell swimming under and over her . Nora said , " Alberta , you are one of the few people I can talk to . You have a listening face  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that one of the seven wonders ? Is that like the crying rock ? She could have said , " It 's because f never get a word in edgewise , " but she did n't ; Nora was explaining her profound fear of death . Martha was going to kill her . Nora could n't get that phone call out of her mind . She said , " Alberta , I keep hearing Martha 's clear , cheerful voice saying , ' Yes . Nora ? Is that you ? I 've got a gun and I 'm going to kill you , you little slut . ' " " Is n't it astonishing , " Nora said after thoroughly wiping her eyes , " that a thing so pure and good could get twisted up in evil , like the while shorebirds getting stuck in oil slicks ? " She quietly added , testing the tea with her finger , that maybe Alberta , who was so trustworthy and kind , could help her find a place and then she could get a job and stay here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of blinding intensity they would meet . Alberta said , " Sure , we 'll find you a place . " As she walked away from Nora she scowled , thinking how far behind she was on the books for Estelle 's Diner , and how everything in the garden was dying from neglect . Alberta , who almost never swore , looked at her listening face in the bathroom mirror and said , " Crap and hell . " Then she made herself smile because it was n't , after all the end of the world . Over the next few days Nora stayed in the living room writing and reading magazines , telling Alberta her stories , and watching television late at night . Alberta asked her if she wanted to hoe in the garden or help freeze the spinach ; Nora said she would but the anxiety had given her the worst stomach pains . In bed , Jack asked Alberta if Nora was capable of motion and Alberta said , " Jack ! She 's having a hard time . She says she feels hunted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked her hair and tried to kiss her neck . She was too tired and furthermore she was angry for several reasons . Where had he been while she was febrile , trying to deal with all this ? He could go to the barn and milk every last drop from all the cows he had personally named . He had tasks too numerous to list that could , if need he , occupy him for days on end . When Jack whispered , " lBest friends ? " she said , " I 'm tired " and closed her eyes . Jack did n't see any reason to loiter in the house waiting to establish eye contact with the Poetess . Dinners were enough of a strain because Nora did n't speak to anyone except Alberta ; she did n't look at anyone except Alberta ; for her , apparently , no one else existed . That did n't stop Aunt Marji . The first night , for example , Aunt Marji had told everyone about her pet piglet Mullin and how she used to sleep with it . Nora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over the table to see what was down there but could spot only three kernels of popcorn from last Sunday 's supper . He could not forgive the poet from Kansas , even if someone was trying to kill her . Aunt Marji did not deserve rudeness . He always thought of Aunt Marji as she had been before she lost her short-term memory . She had always been playful , putting peanuts in the pancake batter when a guest was overly solemn or erudite . She had always been stoic and buoyant , even when her husband had dropped dead at supper , his head crashing into a plate of chicken casserole . She did n't let things undo her . Jack was going to see her through her old age , and when she had come to live with them for a two-month trial period thankfully Alberta had taken to her , looked after her , laughed at her jokes , written down bits of the poetry . Alberta had said . " In college I learned that poetic imagination is where you can see likeness when before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " At dinner on the third night , when Aunt Marji exuberantly said , " I 'm as happy as a stewed goose tonight ! " Nora , a vegetarian , murmured under her breath , " Jesus Christ . " Jack abruptly turned on the television . Alberta , wishing that Nora would evaporate and Aunt Marji shut up , went to get the dessert , and Aunt Marji told how she 'd sat in the chicken coop for a full morning , working at laying eggs to fool her brother . HE FOURTH DAY Nora was at the farm , Alberta came into the living room to get one of her account books . Aunt Marji was sitting on the sofa polishing the silver she had brought with her from Ohio , humming to herself , and Nora , both elbows on the table , head resting in her cupped hands , blocking out Aunt Marji , was reading a letter or a long poem . " Alberta , I need your help , " Nora said , closing her notebook . " I really have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tomorrow they would go into the city and start looking for apartments and jobs . It had always been necessary to be motherly to Nora ; she was so helpless and passive . She had always given Alberta the unfamiliar sensation of being older and sensible , with a wealth of information about ordinary things . At sixteen , it was Alberta who had hemmed Nora 's cheerleading skirt ; now at twenty-six , it was Alberta who showed Nora how to make frozen orange juice come to life . They had n't yet fully discussed every aspect of Philip Lovell because Alberta was behind on the books . One thing she did want to know was what Philip Lovell was doing back in Iowa that was so important while Nora lay wasting away each night in front of the television . " Does Philip know where you are , Nora ? " Alberta asked , standing at the head of the table to indicate that she wanted the abridged version . Nora shook her head , turning her chair so that her pink-shirted back seemed to wink at Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he would come and find me . He would help me if he knew how desperate f felt . In my dreams he 's always there at the end of a horrific experience . " She sighed , examining her white hands . " I feel it . It 's gone too far now ; when he finds where I am he will come and get me . " As Aunt Marji clattered the silver Alberta asked when they had last seen each other . " Three months ago . " Nora worked at her cuticles as if each nail had a revelation about the final parting . " He was sitting outside the library . It was seven o'clock in the morning . I walked by on the other side of the street and would n't have noticed him except a car honked at a cat and I looked up . There he was , all hunched over . " She frowned , pulling at a hangnail , and then abruptly stopped and folded her hands . " 1 crossed the street and sat down next to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said we should n't meet anymore for a while , maybe a long time , that he had to help his 63 wife get better , really make the effort . I said okay . I understood . He cried and then ran away . " She looked up at Alberta ? " I did n't even get to kiss him goodbye . " Aunt Marji said , " When I was little it was my job to polish the silver . " She held out a spoon for a moment as if she were the Statue of Liberty . Wiping it with a nearly black rag she went on , " I made them into characters : spoons are the nicest , like waddling washerwomen with round heads ; forks are the rich people , snooty ladies with lots of hair and minks ; knives are the gents , and butter knives are the children . " " That sounds like fun , Aunt Marji , " Alberta said , shifting her weight from her right foot to her left . " Do you think I 'm crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You have faith . There 's nothing wrong with having faith . " " Salad forks are the young bucks , college kids , and soup spoons are policemen with big bellies . " Aunt Marji had all the silver sorted on a tray according to their station in life ; the unfortunate knives and forks were still gray with tarnish . " He 's so special . Alberta , I 've waited for him for such a long time . " " Do n't give a fig , " Aunt Marji said , moving the tray from her lap to the floor . " I never finish anything nowadays and I do n't give a fig . " She came to the table so she could address both parties . " Alberta here is nicer than a piece of French toast . She does n't care . Old people like me like to sleep a lot . Alberta , she lets me . Not like the nurse who used to look in on me . She was always wanting me to get up and be busy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Sleep is where I see my James , my prince of a husband . What a chap . My prince . " " Have a good nap , " Alberta said . " And I 'm telling you , " Aunt Marji called from the pantry , " I 'm going to sing like a lark when I get to heaven 's gate . James , he 'll meet me , see , and then we 'll do the tango . Whew , it 'll be a great day . " Nora had that worried look , the furrowed brow , as if she wanted to say , " What the hell is she talking about ? " On the fifth night , when the phone rang , Nora 's heart went irregular . Alberta picked it up and Nora heard fragments of that familiar chipper voice , always so cheerful and direct . " It 's for you , " Alberta said , handing the phone to Nora . When Nora said , " Hello ? " the voice laughed and then there was silence and the dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She buried her head in her hands and choked , " It 's her . " Alberta went to her chair and put her arms around Nora , saying , " It 's all right . She 's powerless . She ca n't find you here , and she ca n't hurt you . " Nora lifted her head long enough to say , " My mother must have given her your number . " The second , third , and fourth time the phone rang there was the same laugh and then the dial tone . Each time the phone rang Aunt . Marji shouted out , " Good news , maybe it 's good news ! " She was remembering when the Eagle store called her up to tell her about the free trip to Hawaii . The fifth time they did n't answer it and then they unplugged the phone . FTER several days of looking , Nora found a room in Milwaukee ; Alberta lent her $400 and got her settled with a hot plate , linens , two posters , and a wastebasket . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse on the following Monday . After she left , Jack said to Alberta , " Well , hello Alberta ! Have n't seen you in a coon 's age . Now that you 've had your homeless-waif experience can we resume our normal life ? " Alberta kissed the back of his neck and sighed , " I 'll never have another guest as long as I live . " She was so tired of taking care of people . She suddenly fervently wished that Aunt Marji would win a two-year trip to the Grecian islands . She suddenly had the urge to bite the back of Jack 's neck for making her live with his homeless waif of an aunt . Aunt Marji came into the kitchen saying , " Is that little black bug gone ? That girl was just like a little black bug who hides under rocks all day long . Some people have to be unhappy I suppose . Not me . I 've been lucky in my life , luckier than the heel of a loaf of bread . " " You sure have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . That night , after Alberta and Jack went to sleep , Aunt Marji stayed up to watch " Love Boat . " She liked programs that had happy endings .

He wears blue trunks and she looks so full in a swimsuit . It 's always so nice to watch young people . " And , as if she had just opened the invitation , Aunt Marji said , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't hear the man on the phone anymore because the couple was getting into bed . She watched them kiss for a long time before she absently hung up the phone . What came over her was the sense of satisfaction , something she had n't felt in years ; the old feeling of doing a thing perfectly right . ?
