Flashbulbs popped , klieg lights blazed . On the 17th floor of federal police headquarters in Sao Paulo last week , Romeu Tuma , the mustachioed federal police superintendent who is Brazil 's best-known detective , stood amid a gaggle of reporters and television crewmen assembled for a regular briefing . Without delay , Tuma came to the point . The evidence , he said firmly , was steadily mounting that the body , which had been exhumed from a graveyard in the little town of Embu a few days earlier , was that of Josef Mengele , the Nazi doctor who sent some 400,000 concentration-camp prisoners to their deaths during World War II and cruelly experimented on thousands of others in his genetics research . What , cried a reporter , about the news just in from West Germany that Mengele 's son Rolf was certain the body was his father 's ? That , said Tuma evenly , would support his own theory but not affect his investigation . <P> So it went virtually every day last week . As a team of Brazilian forensic experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal to determine whether they were Mengele 's or not , Tuma  --  and others  --  provided bits and pieces of fresh evidence in what could be the final act of a dramatic and drawn-out manhunt , a bitter trail of false identities , narrow escapes and never-ending questions . For more than a quarter-century , Nazi hunters from Israel and other countries had crisscrossed Europe and much of South America trying to track down the elusive " Angel of Death . " Was the hunt finally about to end ? Or would the searchers discover that they had been duped in a giant hoax , lured into an ingeniously woven web of disinformation , implying that Mengele , a man with a $3.4 million reward on his head , might still be at large ? <P> As the story unfolded and the evidence grew , no final answers were available . For the moment at least , even if the possibility of Mengele 's death assumed greater plausibility , the great mystery remained unsolved . In Sao Paulo , new witnesses came forward , telling the police or the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fleshing out earlier claims that he had lived reclusively in Brazil between 1961 and 1979 . In West Germany , Rolf Mengele broke the family 's long silence not only to announce that he had " no doubt " that the Embu bones were the remains of his father but to turn over to a West German magazine photographs , letters and documents purportedly relevant to the Mengele story . Late last week , moreover , U.S. handwriting analysts confirmed that the script on documents found in Brazil corresponded with that on other Mengele papers . <P> Gerald Posner , an American lawyer who has assembled 25,000 pages of documents and interviewed 200 witnesses in South America during a four-year search for the doctor of death , explained that when he first heard of the find at Embu , he thought the story a hoax . After flying from New York City to Sao Paulo , however , Posner said , " We have to await the forensic investigation , but I 'm starting to think he may be dead . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
