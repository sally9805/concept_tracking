URBAN SKYWAYS  --  elevated , enclosed walks  --  have long protected pedestrians against winter ' s chill in Minneapolis and a few other Snow Belt cities . But now , grids of glass tubes cross a level above busy streets to connect hotels , department stores , convention centers and office buildings in 20 U.S. and Canadian cities . Ten other cities are planning or building similar systems of indoor walkways . Skyways open up a second-story retailing opportunity by providing access to stores in corridors of adjacent buildings . Cities such as Dallas , Cincinnati and Charlotte , N.C. , have embraced skyways not only as a convenient escape from extreme weather but also as a means to reduce traffic congestion and lure stores and shoppers from suburban malls . The use of skyways as " an economic tool in a downturned downtown area has overridden the climate-control issue , " especially in Sun Belt cities , observes Carol Morphew , a project planner with Bernard Jacob Architects in Minneapolis . In Des Moines , for instance , a network of sky bridges began taking shape in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office structure and nearby city parking garage . Now , 16 skyways constructed with public and private funds link the downtown core ; four more blocks will be tied in over the next 18 months . The network " sort of triggered the downtown comeback , " says Patricia Zingsheim , an associate architect for the city ' s planning department . " A lot of people have invested money in the downtown they wouldn ' t have otherwise . " SKYWALKS TYPICALLY BRING to the upper retailing level a different mix of stores from those at street level . The second story shops cater to business executives and office workers who often follow a set skyway route to get to work or a favorite eating spot . The system " creates guided traffic rather than aimless street traffic , " notes Miss Morphew , who has studied skyways extensively . Saks Fifth Avenue usually prefers suburban locations , but a $15 million skywalk system helped persuade the retail chain to build its new Cincinnati outlet downtown . The 12-block network makes downtown " much like a mall ; you walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saks ' s general manager there . Sales at the store , which opened in March , are running 30% ahead of expectations ; Mr. Uselmann attributes this partly to the unexpectedly big crowd of lunchtime shoppers , many of them men . Downtown hotels find their skyway hookups can be a boon to landing convention business . Two hotels situated catty-corner to each other in Dallas have dubbed themselves " The Dallas Connection " to promote their rooms , restaurants and shops as one complex . The sky bridge is their sole link . The Sheraton Dallas and the Plaza of the Americas Hotel " feel like they ' ve got some promising responses " from their first joint marketing effort , says James Cloar , president of the Dallas Central District Association . YET SKYWALKS HAVE their share of drawbacks and detractors . As the " generic solution " to the problems of cities , they aren ' t the answer , says Mr. Cloar . They tend to hurt street-level stores . In St. Paul , Minn. , for example , about 65% of the downtown retailers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 bridges . The 163 first-floor outlets in the original 12-block skywalk area have shrunk to about 120 since 1965 . The sky bridges attract criminals as well as retailers . The system " has presented a whole new problem for us in terms of enforcement , " complains Mary Ford , a research analyst with the St. Paul Police Department . Roving bands of truant youths find the heated and cooled skywalks " a real convenient place to do purse-snatchings of elderly people or to pick pockets , " she continues . " There are all sorts of places to hide-behind pillars , in elevators or storage closets . " Several rapes and rape attempts occurred in St. Paul ' s skyways after a recent cutback in police patrols . CITY OFFICIALS and local residents have fought the proposed expansion of sky bridges in Seattle , Hartford , Denver and elsewhere , usually out of concern that they would ob struct scenic views , ruin historic buildings ' facades or alter the street-level ambiance . A Seattle City Council ordinance adopted about two years ago prohibits skyways that block views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted new construction . Last April , the council ordered the University of Washington to dismantle its little-used skywalk connecting a hotel and an office building because it partially blocked the view of the city ' s famous Space Needle . Seattle ' s Mayor Charles Royer insists the real concern is that skyways defeat the city ' s commitment to " concentrating retail and sidewalk activity right on the streets , " with a plethora of cafes , street musicians and art displays . Sensitive to such criticism , some other cities with skywalks are trying to keep streets lively , too , and assure the vitality of first-floor shops . Both Charlotte and St. Paul are turning streets into outdoor pedestrian malls closed to most traffic . Des Moines is planting more trees and requiring that new buildings contain a certain amount of glass , rather than brick , at the street level . Skywalks ' shortcomings don ' t seem likely to halt their spread elsewhere because , Des Moines ' Miss Zingsheim notes , " There is a lot of pressure from businesspersons . They ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtown  --  to make it more attractive than the outskirts ? ' " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
