I gave this some thought after Elly Ameling presented another of her predictably enchanting programs last Sunday afternoon here . Oddly enough , it was her Carnegie Hall recital debut . Undoubtedly for that reason it was her most relaxing program to date - a list of 17 composers , with one to three well-known songs from each , constituting a minisurvey of the finest song composers ' finest efforts . There were no novelties , no ' ' surprises , ' ' as she noted in her charming printed introduction to the concert. // The afternoon , subtitled ' ' A Festive Program , ' ' included songs by Mozart , John Weldon , Schubert , Wolf , Brahms , Schumann , Strauss , Faure , Debussy , Poulenc , Chausson , Duparc , Rodrigo , Carlos Guasavino , Satie , Hahn , Schonberg . In this day of novelty-above-all , a program of familiar things was daring . It was also great fun. // The cliche has it that variety is the spice of life . True , it can be the secret ingredient that keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the crucial lure to ensure a full house if the artist ' s name is not sufficiently known . Nonetheless , variety has been a soporific as well . I remember a program by Dame Janet Baker a few years back that was varied , full of the unusual and utterly unfamiliar , and yet a dry and , sad to say , dull evening . But that was a rare exception for Miss Baker. // What then does make for a good recital program ? It obviously has to have some balance , and within groups , proportion ( unless , of course , the singer is doing a major song cycle composed to be sung consecutively ) . Generally , single songs should fit together in some sort of perceptible sequence . A group needs to contemplate a mood , and either sustain it or offset it with various contrasts . Then the singer must find the right sequence for the selections chosen. // Even in something as wide-ranging as Miss Ameling ' s program , the progression and balance within sections was logical and served to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional program was presented by Dame Janet Baker in Carnegie about five weeks ago . Schubert , Schumann , Mahler , Richard Strauss , and Gounod were the composers in question , with a superior mix of the familiar ( Schubert ' s ' ' An Sylvia ' ' sung in the English words Shakespeare penned for ' ' Two Gentlemen of Verona ' ' ) to the four seldom-heard Gounod selections. // Elisabeth Soderstrom went the other direction entirely when she offered the first in the ' ' Great Performers at Lincoln Center ' ' series entitled ' ' The Art of Song Series . ' ' Sibelius , Grieg , Benedict , Thrane , Tchaikovsky , Grechaninoff , and Rachmaninoff were the composers , and she found songs rarely , if ever , heard on these shores . But again , she knows the repertoire . She knows the audience ( sophisticated , musically aware ) and could easily prove that remarkable songs exist in other than the German-French tradition. // On the other hand , Katia Ricciarelli made no pretenses in her recital . She let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be expected to delve into the hidden meanings of songs in languages she does not know very well . So we got Vivaldi , Bononcini , Rossini , Donizetti , Faure , Liszt , and Rodrigo songs and arias. // This raises , at least tangentially , the issue of how many good-to-great recitalists we have today . With records , there seems to be less of a hunger to hear great singers in non-opera performances  --  witness the pitifully small house that was on hand for Teresa Berganza ' s memorable Carnegie Hall recital earlier this season . More and more singers sing in opera around the country , around the world . Lieder as an art form has lost considerable ground , unless it be in the ' ' hands ' ' of a Fischer-Dieskau , a Janet Baker , an Elly Ameling. // Miss Soderstrom filled Tully Hall , and Miss Ameling did the same to Carnegie . Janet Baker always sells out Carnegie . All three women are mistresses of the interior mood . Miss Ameling ' s is the prettiest voice of the three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she is not afraid of letting it go white , hooty , and ugly for effect . Miss Soderstrom , too , has a distinctive timbre that she uses to splendid effect , though she tires a bit these days . All three can traverse the moods from dread and gloom to carefree comedy with ease . Miss Ameling and Miss Soderstrom talk to their audiences . All three radiate a joy at being able to share their unique gifts. // Miss Ricciarelli is reticent on stage , almost apologetic . Her singing lacked the sort of finesse and control one expects from a singer of her credentials . Her program had little imagination and was strikingly short on content musical . Her fans , gathered in the not-very-full expanses of Carnegie , tried now and then to muster up enthusiasm . But for the standard opera singer to do a nonstandard but not particularly imaginative program , and not ' ' sell ' ' it the way , say , Luciano Pavarotti does , seems to serve no purpose at all. // If this be the future of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few young singers really interested in keeping the art form alive  --  there is little hope at all for the future of lieder in America. // // Lucine Amara ' s high standards // Lucine Amara was in the news several years back for her unprecedented suit against the Metropolitan Opera for discrimination on the basis of age . She won , and the Met has had to give her at least one performance a year for three years . She returned after the litigation last season , as Amelia in ' ' Un Ballo in Maschera . ' ' This year , she sang Leonora in ' ' Il Trovatore. ' ' // Miss Amara was a fixture at the Met until her troubles began both as a scheduled performer and as a so-called cover artist .

Viorica Cortez brought a certain misplaced visual glamour to the witchlike Azucena , but also breathy tones and uninvolved acting rounding out her performance . Richard J. Clark revealed a badly handled voice and a highly faulty memory as di Luna. // //
