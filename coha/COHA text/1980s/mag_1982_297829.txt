New law permits divorce-even for incompatibility <P> Yu Luojin , a Peking writer , was mortified by her second husband Cai Zhongpei . In fact , she was sure she had married a bumpkin . He never seemed to talk about aesthetics and the finer things of life , only stupid topics like the price of yellowfish . He flailed and hooted like a child while watching soccer games , and when she hauled him to the theater for some cultural uplift , he laughed when he should have cried . One day Yu tried to coax him into reading a book . He snapped : " I 've been selected a model worker every year without reading books and newspapers ! " That did it . She rushed to the nearest court and filed for divorce . After much publicity and a judge 's stern lecture on socialist morality , Yu won her case , in effect on grounds of incompatibility .

An ancient proverb tells newlyweds : " You 're married until your hair turns white . " In practice , however , divorce , while almost impossible for women to initiate , has traditionally been easy for men . All the husband had to do was send an emissary to his father-in-law to declare that he " can not worship at the ancestral shrine with your daughter any longer . " The father-in-law usually acquiesced , with apologies for not having brought his daughter up properly . <P> In the old view , it was also shameful for women to marry more than once . Even if a bride 's betrothed died before the wedding , she could be forced to go through the ceremony with a wooden figure ( or a symbolic rooster ) and then spend the rest of her life single .
