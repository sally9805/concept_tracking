Can the gentle sea creature be saved from extinction ? <P> <P> They look a bit like Grover Cleveland . <P> Same whiskers , thick wrinkled skin . <P> Hefty too : up to 2,200 Ibs. of blubbery bulk . But while Cleveland hailed from New Jersey , the manatee is a native of warmer climes : the rivers of West Africa , the Amazon basin , the shores of the Caribbean , and the coasts of Florida . Now the gentle and once plentiful creature is in serious danger of extinction . In Africa and South America , tribesmen have hunted it for its delectable meat-not unlike veal-as well as its fat and oil , leathery skin and ivory-like bone . In Florida , only some 1,000 remain , and the death rate appears to be exceeding the birth rate . <P> A 1907 law made manatee hunting illegal in Florida . But the creature , which has no natural enemies , still faces a marine foe : the whirring propellers of the state 's 500,000 speedboats . Because manatees loll just below the water surface with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure cruisers . Collisions are common , and even if the manatee survives , its 1-in. - thick skin is brutally gouged by the sharp blades . One marine expert estimates that 80% of the state 's manatees are propeller-scarred . Manatees also drown by drifting into flood-control gates ; some have been cruelly murdered by vandals . <P> No creature could be less deserving of such abuse . The manatee is a peaceful herbivore , retaining from its prehistoric days on land the vestigial bones of hind legs and three nails , once claws , at the end of each flipper . It leads a blissful existence chomping underwater weeds and drowsing on sandy bottoms , with reluctant trips up for air about every 4 min . Young manatees love to play with each other or people , embracing with their flippers and kissing full on the muzzle . A mother will usually bear just one calf every three to five years , not enough to offset the current attrition rate . <P> Some legislation is already in effect to help save the manatees . The 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed by stiff fines and jail terms for offenders . The 1978 Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act restricts boat speeds in critical areas ( maximum penalty : $1,000 and a year in jail ) and even forbids divers from enticing the animals into underwater play . <P> The state has set up a toll-free telephone hot line for reporting manatee death , injury or harassment . Billboards and bumper stickers are in evidence , proclaiming the manatee the " Endangered Floridian . " But the battle is far from won . Warns University of Miami Marine Biologist Daniel Odell : " The manatees are sitting targets for everything , and it will take a major effort to preserve them . "
