uniforms of Navajo Policemen emerged . One was George Benaly , who long ago had worked with Leaphorn out of Many Farms . One was a jolly-looking , plump young man with a thin mustache , whom Leaphorn did n't recognize . The other was Jim Chee . The round brim of Chee 's hat was tilted , shading his face , but Leaphorn could see enough of it to match the photo in Chee 's personnel file . A longish , narrowface fitting a longish , narrow body  --  all shoulders and no hips . The " Tuba City Navajo , " as some anthropologist had labeled the type . Pure Athabascan genetics . Tall , long torso , narrow pelvis , destined to be a skinny old man . Leaphornhimself fell into the " Checkerboard type . " He represented  --  according to this authority  --  a blood/gene mix with the Pueblo peoples . Leaphorn did n't particularly like the theory , but it was useful ammunition when Emma pressed him to get his weight and belt size down a bit . The three officers , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plump officer had not noticedLeaphorn 's car parked under the olive tree . Benaly had seen it without registering any interest . Only Chee was conscious of it , instantly , aware that it was occupied , that the occupant was watching . Perhaps that alertness was the product of being shot at two nights earlier . Leaphorn suspectedit was permanent  --  a natural part of the man 's character . Benaly and Plump Cop climbed into their cars and drove out of the lot . Chee extracted something from the back seat of his vehicle and strolled back toward the station , conscious of Leaphorn 's watching presence . Why wait ? Leaphorn thought . He would check in with Largo later . At Leaphorn 's suggestion , they took Chee 's police car to Chee 's trailer . Chee drove , erect and nervous . The trailer , battered , dented , and looking old and tired , sat under a cluster of cottonwoods not a dozen yards from the crumbling north bank of the San Juan River . Cool , Leaphorn thought. 40*Great spot for someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He inspected the three patches of duct tape Chee had used to heal the shotgun wounds in the aluminumskin of his home . About evenly spaced , he noticed . About two feet apart . Each a little more than hip high . Nicely placed to kill somebody in bed if you knew exactly where the bed was located in such a trailer . " Does n't look random , " Leaphorn said , half to himself . " No , " Chee said . " I think some thought went into it . " " Trailer like this . . . Any trouble for anyone to find out where the bed would be located ? How far off the floor ? " " How high to shoot ? " Chee said . " No . It 's a common kind . When I bought it in Flagstaff there were three just about like it on the used lot . See ' em all the time . Anyway , I think they 're all pretty much alike . Where they put the beds . " " I think we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at Farmington , or Gallup , or Flag , can remember anything . " He glanced at Chee . " Maybe a customer came in and asked to see this particular model , and pulled out a tape measure and said he had to measure the bed off to see where to hold the shotgun to get himself a Navajo Policeman . " Chee 's expressionless face eased into what might have been a smile . " I 'm not usually that lucky . " Leaphorn 's fingers were on the tape that covered the hole nearest the front of the trailer . He glanced at Chee again . " Pull it off , " Chee said . " I 've got more tape . " Leaphorn peeled off the patch , inspected the ragged hole punched through the aluminum , then stooped to peer inside . He could see only blue-and-white cloth . Flowers . Chee 's pillow slip . It looked new . Hole torn in the old one , Leaphorn guessed . He was impressed that a bachelor would put a pillowcase on his pillow . Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Leaphorn , who was always skeptical about luck , who was always skepticalabout anything that violated the orderly rules of proba-41*bility . " The report said your cat woke you up . You keep a cat ? " " Not exactly , " Chee said . " It 's a neighbor . Lives out there . " Chee pointed upstream to a sun-baked slope of junipers . But Leaphorn was still looking thoughtfully at the shotgun hole  --  measuring its width with his fingers . " Lives out there under that juniper , " Chee added . " Sometimes when something scares it , it comes in . " " How ? " Chee showed him the flap he 'd cut in the trailer door . Leaphorn examined it . It did n't look new enough to have been put there after the shooting . He noticed that Chee was aware of his examination , and of the suspicion it suggested . " Who tried to kill you ? " Leaphorn asked . " I do n't know , " Chee said . " A new woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee 's expression became totally blank . " No , " Chee said . " Nothing like that . " " It could be something mild . Maybe just talking too often to a woman with a boyfriend who 's paranoid . " " I 've got a woman , " Chee said slowly . " You 've thought all this out ? " Leaphorn asked . He motionedtoward the holes in the side of the trailer . " It 's your ass somebody 's after . " " I 've thought about it , " Chee said . He threw his hands apart , an angry gesture aimed at himself . " Absolutely damned nothing . " Leaphorn studied him , and found himself half persuaded . It was the gesture as much as the words . " Where did you sleep last night ? " " Out there , " Chee said , gesturing toward the hillside . " I have a sleeping bag . " " You and the cat , " Leaphorn said . He paused , dug out his pack of cigarets , offered one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about Roosevelt Bistie ? And Endo-chreney ? " " Funny , " Chee said . " That whole thing 's odd . Bistie 's ... " He paused , hesitated . " Why not come on in , " Chee said . " Have a cup of coffee . " " Why not , " Leaphorn said . It was left-over-from-breakfast coffee . Leaphorn , made an authority on bad coffee by more than two decades of police work , rated it slightly worse than most . But it was warm , and it was coffee , and he sipped it appreciatively while Chee , sitting on the bunk where he had so nearly died , told him about meeting Roosevelt Bistie . " I do n't believe he was faking anything , " Chee concluded . " He did n't act surprised to see us . Seemed pleased when he heard Endocheeney was dead , and then the whole business about shooting at Endocheeney on the roof , thinking he 'd killed him , not really wondering about it until he got home , not going back to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Endocheeney would n't have stuck around to give him a second chance at it . " Chee shrugged , shook his head . " Genuine satisfaction when he heard Endocheeney was dead . I just do n't think he could have been faking any of that . No reason to . Why not just deny everything ? " " All right , " Leaphorn said . " Now , tell me again exactly what he said when you asked him why he wanted to kill Endocheeney . " " Just like I said , " Chee said . " Tell me again . " " He would n't say anything . Just shut his mouth and looked grim and would n't say a word . " " What do you think ? " Chee shrugged . The light through the window over the trailer sink dimmed slightly . The shadow of the thunderheadover the Chuskas had moved across the Shiprock landscape . With the shadow , the cloud 's advance guard of breeze sighed through the window screen . But it would n't rain . Leaphorn had studied the cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a look of uneasy distaste . Leaphornfelt his own face beginning a smile , a wry one . Here we go again , he thought . " Witchcraft ? " Leaphorn asked . " A skinwalker ? " Chee said nothing . Leaphorn sipped the stale coffee . Chee shrugged . " Well , " he said . " That could explain why Bistie would n't talk about it . " " That 's right , " Leaphorn said . He waited . " Of course , " Chee added , " so could other things . Protectingsomebody in the family . " " Right , " Leaphorn said . " If he tells us his motive , it 's also the motive for the guy with the butcher knife . Brother . Cousin . Son . Uncle . What relatives does he have ? " " He 's born to the Streams Come Together Dinee , " Chee said , " and born for the Standing Rock People . Three maternalaunts , four uncles . Two paternal aunts , five uncles . Then he 's got three sisters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a son . So not even counting his clan brothers and sisters , he 's related to just about everybody north of Kayenta . " " Anything else you can think of ? For why he wo n't talk ? " " Something he 's ashamed of , " Chee said . " Incest . Doing something wrong to some relative . Witchery . " Leaphorn could tell Chee did n't like the third alternative any better than he did . " If it 's witchcraft , which one is the skinwalker ? " " Endocheeney , " Chee said . " Not Bistie , " Leaphorn said , thoughtfully . " So if you 're right , Bistie killed himself a witch , or intended to . " Leaphornhad considered this witch theory before . Nothing much wrong with the idea , except proving it . " You pick up anything about Endocheeney to support it ? Or try it on Bistie ? " " Tried it on Bistie . He just looked stubborn . Talked to people up there on the Utah border who knew Endocheeney . Got nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response. 1 AAdHe 's heard about me and witches , Leaphorn thought . " In other words , everybody just shut up , " he said . " How about Wilson Sam . Anything there ? " Chee hesitated . " You mean any connection ? " Leaphorn nodded . It was exactly what he was driving at . They were right . Chee was smart . " That 's out of our jurisdiction here , " Chee said . " Where he was killed , that 's in Chinle 's territory . The subagency at Chinle has that case . " " I know that , " Leaphorn said . " Did you go out there and look around ? Ask around ? " It was exactly what Leaphorn would have done under the circumstances  --  with two killingsalmost the same hour . Chee looked surprised , and a little abashed . " On my day off , " he said . " Kennedy and I had n't gotten anything helpful on the Endocheeney thing yet , and I thought  --  " Leaphorn held up his palm . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that links them ? " Chee shook his head . " No family connections . Or clan connections . Endocheeney ran sheep , used to work when he was younger with that outfit that lays rails for the Santa Fe railroad . He got food stamps , and now and then sold firewood . Wilson Sam was also a sheepherder , had a job as a flagman on a highway construction job down near Winslow . He was fifty-something years old . Endocheeney was in his middle seventies . " " Did you try Sam 's name on people who knew Endocheeney ? To see if . . . " Leaphorn make a sort of inclusive gesture . " No luck , " Chee said . " Did n't seem to know the same people . Endocheeney 's people did n't know Sam . Sam 's peoplenever heard of Endocheeney . " " Did you know either one of them ? Ever ? In any way ? Even something casual ? " " No connection with me , either , " Chee said . " They 're notS . AKdthe kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves . Nothing like that . " " No mutual friends ? " Chee laughed . " And no mutual enemies , as far as I can learn . " The laugh , Leaphorn thought , seemed genuine . " Okay , " he said . " How about the shooting-at-you busi-ness . " Chee described it again . While he talked , the cat came through the flap in the screen . It was a large cat , with short tan hair , a stub of a tail , and pointed ears . It stopped just inside the screen , frozen in the crouch , staring at Leaphorn with intense blue eyes . Quite a cat , Leaphorn thought . Heavy haunches like a bobcat . The hair was matted on the left side of its head and what looked like a scar distorted the smoothness of its flank . Some belagana tourist 's pet , he guessed . Probably taken along on a vacation and lost . Leaphorn listened to Chee with half of his mind , alert only for some variation in an account he had already read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the phone . The other half of his consciousness focused on the cat . It still crouched by the door judging whether this strange human was a threat . The flap probably had made enough noise when the cat came in to waken a man sleeping lightly , Leaphorn decided . The cat was thin , bony ; its muscles had the ropy look of wild predators . If it had , in fact , been a pampered pet , it had adapted well . It had got itself in harmony with its new life . Like a Navajo , it survived . Chee had finished his account , without saying anything new . Or anything different . The metal seat of the folding chair was hard against Leaphorn 's tailbone . He felt more tired than he should have felt after nothing much more than the drive from Window Rock . Chee was said to be smart . He seemed smart . Largo insisted he was . A smart man shouldLA. have some idea who was trying to kill him . And why . If he was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got light , you looked outside , " Leaphorn prompted . " What did you find ? " " Three empty shotgun shells , " Chee said . His eyes said he knew Leaphorn already knew all this . " Twelve gauge . Centerfire . Rubber sole tracks of a small shoe . Size seven . Fairly new . Led off up the slope to the road up there . Top of the slope , a vehicle had been parked . Tires were worn and it leaked a lot of oil . " " Did he come in the same way ? " " No , " Chee said . The question had interested him . " Tracks down along the bank of the river . " " Past where this cat has its den . " " Right , " Chee said . Leaphorn waited . After a long silence , Chee said , " It seemed to me that something might have happened there . To spook the cat out of his hiding place . So I looked around . " He made a deprecatory gesture . " Ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juniper . It 's not far from where people dump their trash and there 's always a lot of stuff blowing around . But I found this . " He got out his billfold , extracted a bit of yellow paper , and handed it to Leaphorn . " It 's new , " he said . " It had n't been out there in the dirt very long . " It was the wrapper off a stick of Juicy Fruit gum . " Not much , " Chee said , looking embarrassed . It was n't much . Leaphorn could n't imagine how it would be useful . In fact , it seemed to symbolize just how little they had to work on in any of these cases . " But it 's something , " he said . His imagination made the figure squatting behind the juniper , watching the Chee trailer , a small figure holding a pump shotgun in his right hand , reaching into his shirt pocket with his left hand , fishing out a package of gum . No furious emotion here . Calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time . And , as an accidental by-product , giving the cat crouched under the juniper a case of nerves , eroding its instinct to stay hidden until this human left , sending it into a panicky dash for a safer place . Leaphorn smiled slightly , enjoying the irony . " We know he chews gum . Or she does , " Chee said . " And what kind he sometimes chews . And that he 's ... " Chee searched for the right word . " Cool . " And I know , Leaphorn thought , that Jim Chee is smart enough to think about what might have spooked the cat . He glanced at the animal , which was still crouched by the flap , its blue eyes fixed on him . The glance was enough to tilt the decision . Two humans in a closed place were too many . The cat flicked through flap , clack-clack , and was gone . Loud enough to wake a light sleeper , especially if he was nervous . Did Chee have something to be nervous about ? Leaphorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . " You read the report on Wilson Sam , " Leaphorn said . " And you went out there . When ? Let 's go over that again . " They went over it . Chee had visited the site four days after the killing and he 'd found nothing to add significant data to the original report . And that told little enough . A ground-water pond where Wilson Sam 's sheep drank was going dry . Sam had been out looking for a way to solve that problem  --  checking on his flock . He had n't returned with nightfall . The next morning some of the Yazzie outfit into which Sam was married had gone out to look for him . A son of his sister-in-law had remembered hearing a dog howling . They found the dog watching the body in an arroyo that runs into Tyende Creek south of the Greasewood Flats . The investigating officers from Chinle had arrived a little before noon . The back of Sam 's head had been crushed , just above where head and neck join . The subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was found at the scene . Relatives agreed that it was n't Sam's48*shovel . The body apparently had fallen , or had rolled , down the bank and the assailant had climbed down after it . The nephew had driven directly out to the Dennehotso Trading Post , called the police , and then followed instructions to keep everybody away from the body until they arrived . " There were still some pretty good tracks when I got there , " Chee said . " Been a little shower there the day before the killing and a little runoff down the arroyo bottom . Cowboyboots , both heels worn , size ten , pointed toes . Heavy man , probably two hundred pounds or over , or he was carrying something heavy . He walked around the body , squatted beside it . " Chee paused , face thoughtful . " He got down on both knees beside the body . Spent a little time , judging from the scuff marks and so forth . I thought maybe they were made by our people when they picked up the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were there when he 'd checked originally . " " Gorman ? " " He 's back with us now , " Chee said . " But he was loaned out to Chinle back in June . Vacation relief . He was that guy who was walking out in the parking lot with me at noon . Gorman and Benaly . Gorman is the sort of fat one . " " Was the killer a Navajo ? " Leaphorn asked . Chee hesitated , surprised . " Yes , " he said . " Navajo . " " You sound sure , " Leaphorn said . " Why Navajo ? " " Funny . I knew he was Navajo . But I did n't think about why , " Chee said . He counted it off on his fingers . " He did n't step over the body , which could have just happened that way . But when he walked down the arroyo , he took care not to walk where the water had run . And on the way back to the road , a snake had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled his feet . " Chee paused . " Or do white men do that too ? " " I doubt it , " Leaphorn said . The don't-step-over-people business grew out of families living in one-room hogans , . AOtsleeping on the floor . A matter of respect . And the desert herders ' respect for rain must have produced the taboo against stepping in water 's footprints . Snakes ? Leaphorn tried to remember . His grandmother had told him that if you walk across a snake 's trail without erasing it by shufflingyour feet , the snake would follow you home . But then his grandmother had also told him it was taboo for a child to keep secrets from grandmothers , and that watching a dog urinate would cause insanity . " How about the killer at Endocheeney'splace ? Another Navajo ? Could it have been the same person ? " " Not many tracks there , " Chee said . " Body was about a hundred yards from the hogan , with the whole family millingaround after he was found . And we had n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you think ? Another Navajo ? " Chee thought . " I do n't know , " he said . " Could n't be absolutelysure . But when we eliminated what everybody who lived there was wearing , I think it was a boot with a flat rubber heel . And probably a smallish hole worn in the right sole . " " Different suspect , then , " Leaphorn said . " Or different shoes . " In fact , three different suspects . In fact , maybe four different suspects , counting Onesalt . He shook his head , thinking of the implausible , irrational insanity of it . Then he thought of Chee . An impressive young man . But why did n't he have at least an inkling of who had tried to kill him ? Or why ? Could he possibly not know ? Leaphorn 's back hurt . Sitting too long always did it these days . Easing himself out of the chair , he walked to the window over the sink and looked out . He felt something gritty under his boot sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead pellet from a shotgun shell . He showed it to Chee . " This one of them ? " " I guess so , " Chee said . " I swept up , but when they wentthrough the bedclothes , they bounced around . Got into ev-erything . " Into everything except Jim Chee , Leaphorn thought . Too bad he had so much trouble learning to believe in luck . " Did you see anything at all that would connect the Endocheeney and Sam things ? Anything at all ? Anything to connect eitherone of them to this ? " Leaphorn gestured at the three patched shotgun holes . " I 've thought about that , " Chee said . " Nothing . " " Did the name Irma Onesalt turn up either place ? " " Onesalt ? The woman somebody shot down near WindowRock ? No . " " I 'm going to ask Largo to take you off of everything else and have you rework everything about Endocheeney and Sam , " Leaphorn said . " You willing ? I mean talk to everybodyabout everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a fix on whatever the killers were driving . Just try to find out every damn thing . Work on it day after day after day until we get some feeling for what the hell went on . All right ? " " Sure , " Chee said . " Fine . " " Anything else about this shooting of your own here that did n't seem to fit on the FBI report ? " Chee thought about it . His lips twitched in a gesture of doubt or deprecation . " I do n't know , " he said . " Just this morning , I found this . Might not have anything to do with anything . Probably does n't . " He pulled out his wallet again and extracted from it something small and roundish and ivory-colored . He handed it to Leaphorn . It was a bead formed , apparently , from bone . " Where was it ? " " On the floor under the bunk . Maybe it fell out when I changed the bedding . " " What do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that had beads like that on it , or knew anybody who did . And I wonder how it got here . " " Or why ? " Leaphorn asked . " Yes . Or why . " If you believed in witches , Leaphorn thought , as Chee probably did , you would have to think of a bone bead as a way witches killed  --  the bone being human , and the fatal illness being " corpse sickness . " And if you loaded your own shotgun shells , or even if you did n't , you would know how simple it would be to remove the little plug from the end , and the wadding , and add a bone bead to the lead pellets. 52*sTHE WIND BLEW OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST , hot anddry , whipping sand across the rutted track in front of Jim Chee 's patrol car . Chee had backed the car a hundred yards up the gravel road that led to Badwater Wash Trading Post . He 'd parked it under the gnarled limbs of a one-seed juniper  --  a place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road he had traveled . Now he simply sat , waiting and watching . If anyone was following , Chee intended to know it . " I 'm going to go along with the lieutenant , " Captain Largo had told him . " Leaphorn wants me to rearrange things and let you work on our killings . " As usual when he talked , Captain Largo 's hands were living their separate life , sorting through papers on the captain 's desk , rearrangingwhatever the captain kept in the top drawer , trying to reshape a crease in the captain 's hat . " I think he 's wrong , " Largo said . " I think we ought to leave those cases to the FBI . The FBI 's not going to break them , and neither are we , but the FBI 's getting paid for it , and nobody 's going to do any good on them until we have some luck  --  and taking you off your regular work is n't going to make us lucky . Is it ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Largo expected an answer , or wanted one , but being agreeable seemed a53.4good policy . He did n't want the captain to change his mind . " I think that Leaphorn thinks you getting shot is connected with one or the other of those killings , or maybe both of them . He did n't say so , but that 's what I think he thinks . I ca n't see any connection . How about it ? " Chee shrugged . " I do n't see how there could be . " " No , " Largo agreed . His expression , as he looked at Chee , was skeptical . " Unless you 're not telling me something . " The tone of the statement included a question mark . " I 'm not not telling you anything , " Chee said . " Sometimes you have n't , " Largo said . But he did n't pursueit . " Real reason I 'm going along with this is I want you to stay alive . Just getting shot at is bad enough . " Largo pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's not finished yet . If somebody kills you , think how it would be . " Largo threw out his arms in a gesture encompassing mountains of forms . " When we had that man killed over in the Crownpoint subagency back in the sixties , they were doing reports on that for two years . " " Okay , " Chee said . " That 's okay with me . " " What I mean is , poke around on Endocheeney and WilsonSam and see what you can hear , but mostly I want you out where it would be hard for anybody to get a shot at you . In case they 're still trying . Let ' em cool off . Be careful . " " Good , " Chee had said , meaning it . And while he was out there , Largo had added , he might as well get some useful work done . For instance , the people at the refinery over at Montezuma Creek were sore because somebody was stealing drip gasoline out of the collector pipeline . And somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Goosenecks , and other such places , and stealing stuff out of the cars . And so forth . The litany had been fairly long , indicating that the decline of human nature on the Utah part of the reservation was about the same as it was in Chee 's usual New Mexico juris-54*diction . " I 'll get you the paperwork , " Largo said , shuffling papers out of various files into a single folder . " Xerox copies . I wish we could put a stop to this getting into people 's cars , " he added . " People raise hell about it , and it gets to the chairman 's office and then he raises hell . Be careful . And get some work done . " And now , parked here out of sight watching his back trail , Chee was being careful , exactly as instructed . If the man ( or the woman ) with the shotgun was following , it would have to be down this road . The only other way to get to the trading post at Badwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then take one of the tracks that connected it to the hogans scattered where terrain allowed along the river . Badwater was n't a place one passed through by accident en route to anywhere else . And now the only dust on the Badwater road was wind dust . The afternoon clouds had formed over Black Mesa , far to the south , producing lightning and air turbulence . As far as Chee could estimate from thirty miles away , no rain was falling . He studied the cloud , enjoying the range of blues and grays , its shapes and its movement . But he was thinking of more somber things . The hours of thinking he had done about who would want to kill him had depressing effects . His imagination had produced an image in his mind  --  himself standing at the face of a great cliff of smooth stone , as blank as a mirror , feeling hopelessly for fingerholds that did n't exist . There was a second unpleasant effect . This persistent hunt for malice , for ill will , for hatred  --  examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gloomy . And then there was Lieutenant Leaphorn . He 'd gotten what he wanted from the man  --  more than he 'd expected . But the lieutenant had n't trusted him when they 'd met , and he had n't trusted him when they 'd parted . Leaphorn had n't liked the bone bead . When Chee had handed it to him , the lieutenant 's face had changed , .55*expressing distaste and what might have been contempt . In the small universe of the Navajo Police , total membership perhaps less than 120 sworn officers , Lieutenant Leaphorn was a Fairly Important Person , and somewhat of a legend . Everybody knew he hated bootleggers . Chee shared that sentiment . Everybody also knew Leaphorn had no tolerance for witchcraft or anything about it  --  for those who believed in witches , or stories about skinwalkers , corpse sickness , the cures for same , and everything connected with the Navajo Wolves . There were two stories about how Leaphorn had acquired this obsession . It was said that when he was new on the force in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Checkerboard . He had n't acted on what he 'd heard , and a fellow had killed three witches and got a life term for murder and then committed suicide . That was supposed to be why the lieutenant did n't like witchcraft , which was a good enough reason . The other story was that he was a descendant of the great Chee Dodge and had inherited Dodge 's determination that belief in skinwalkershad no part in the Navajo culture , that the tribe had been infected with the notion while it was held captive down at Fort Sumner . Chee suspected both stories were true . Still , Leaphorn had kept the bone bead . " I 'll see about it , " he 'd said . " Send it to the lab . Find out if it is bone , and what kind of bone . " He 'd torn a page from his notebook , wrapped the bead in it , and placed it in the coin compartment of his billfold . Then he 'd looked at Chee for a moment in silence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds strange , " Chee had said . " But you know you could pry out the end of a shotgun shell and pull out the wadding and stick a bead like this in with the pellets . " Leaphorn 's expression became almost a smile . Was it contempt ? " Like a witch shooting in the bone ? " he asked . ' They 're supposed to do that through a little tube . " He made a puffing shape with his lips . Chee had nodded , flushing just a little . Now , remembering it , he was angry again . Well , to hell with Leaphorn . Let him believe whatever he wanted to believe . The origin story of the Navajos explained witchcraft clearly enough , and it was a logical part of the philosophy on which the Dinee had founded their culture . If there was good , and harmony , and beauty on the east side of reality , then there must be evil , chaos , and ugliness to the west . Like a nonfundamentalist Christian , Chee believed in the poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing in the specific Adam 's rib , or the size of the reed through which the Holy People emerged to the Earth SurfaceWorld , he believed in the lessons such imagery was intended to teach . To hell with Leaphorn and what he did n't believe . Chee started the engine and jolted back down the slope to the road . He wanted to get to Badwater Wash before noon . But he could n't quite get Leaphorn out of his mind . Leaphornposed a problem . " One more thing , " the lieutenant had said . " We 've got a complaint about you . " And he 'd told Chee what the doctor at the Badwater Clinic had said about him . " Yellowhorse claims you 've been interfering with his practiceof his religion , " Leaphorn said . And while the lieutenant'sexpression said he did n't take the complaint as anythingcritically important , the very fact that he 'd mentioned it implied that Chee should desist . " I have been telling people that Yellowhorse is a fake , " Chee said stiffly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretends to be a crystal gazer just to get them into his clinic . " " I hope you 're not doing that on company time , " Leaphornsaid . " Not while you 're on duty . " " I probably have , " Chee said . " Why not ? " " Because it violates regulations , " Leaphorn said , his expressionno longer even mildly amused . " How ? " " I think you can see how , " Leaphorn had said . " We do n't have any way to license our shamans , no more than the federal government can license preachers . If Yellowhorse says he 's a medicine man , or a hand trembler , or a road chief of the Native American Church , or the Pope , it is no businessof the Navajo Tribal Police . No rule against it . No law . " " I 'm a Navajo , " Chee said . " I see somebody cynically using our religion . . . somebody who does n't believe in our religion using it in that cynical way ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " The way I understand it , he recommends they go to a yataalii if they need a ceremonial sing . And he points them at the white man 's hospital only if they have a white man 's problem . Diabetes , for example . " Chee had made no response to that . If Leaphorn could n't see the problem , the sacrilege involved , then Leaphorn was blind . But that was n't the trouble . Leaphorn was as cynical as Yellowhorse . " You , yourself , have declared yourself to be a yataalii , I hear , " Leaphorn said . " I heard you performed a Blessing Way . Chee had nodded . He said nothing . Leaphorn had looked at him a moment , and sighed . " I 'll talk to Largo about it , " he said . And that meant that one of these days Chee would have an argument with the captain about it and if he was n't lucky , Largo would give him a flat , unequivocal order to say nothing more about Yellowhorse as shaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . Now the road to Badwater had changed from bad to worse . Chee concentrated on driving . It was the policy of the Navajo Tribal Police , as a matter of convenience , to consider Badwater to be in the Arizona portion of the Big Reservation . Local wisdom held that the store itself was actually in Utah , about thirty feet north of58*the imaginary line that marked the boundary . One of the local jokes was that Old Man Isaac Ginsberg , who built the place , used to move out of his room behind the trading post and into a stone hogan across the road one hundred yards to the south because he could n't stand the cold Utah winters . Nobody seemed to know exactly where the place was , mapwise . Its location , in a narrow slot surrounded by the fantastic , thousand-foot , red-black-blue-tan cliffs , made pinpointingit on surveys mostly guesswork . And nobody cared enough to do more than guess . Historically , it had been a watering place for herdsmen . In the immense dry badlands of Casa del Eco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring produced pools of drinkablewater . Good water is a magnet anywhere in desert country . In a landscape like Caso del Eco , where gypsum and an arsenal of other soluble minerals tainted rainwater almost as fast as it fell , the stuff that seeped under the sandy arroyo bottoms was such a compound of chemicals that it would kill even tumbleweeds and salt cedar . Thus , the springs in Badwater Wash were a magnet for all living things . They attracted those tough little mammals and reptileswhich endure in such hostile places . Eventually it attractedgoats that strayed from the herds the Navajos had stolen from the Pueblo Indians . Then came the goatherders . Next came sheepherders . Finally , geologists discovered the shallow but persistent Aneth oil deposit , which brought a brief , dusty boom to the plateau . The drilling boom left behind a little refinery at Montezuma Creek , a scattering of robot pumps , and a worn-out spiderweb of truck trails connectingthem with the world . Sometime in this period betweenboom and dust , it had attracted Isaac Ginsberg , who built the trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Afraid of His Wife , and died . The wife to whom Ginsberg owed his title was a Mud Clan Navajo called Lizzie Tonale , who had married Ginsberg in Flagstaff , had con-59*verted to Judaism , and , it was locally believed , had persuadedGinsberg to establish his business in such an incrediblyisolated locale because it was the hardest possible place for her relatives to reach . It would have been a sensible motive . Otherwise , the trading post would have been bankruptin a month , since Lizzie Tonale could refuse no kin who needed canned goods , gasoline , or a loan , and maintain her status as a respectable woman . Whatever her motives , the widow Tonale-Ginsberg had run the post for twenty years before her own death , steadfastly closing on the Sabbath . She had left it to their daughter , the only product of their union . Chee had met this daughter only twice . That was enough to understand how she had earned her local name , which was Iron Woman . Now , as he rolled his patrol car down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash Trading Post , he saw the bulky form of Iron Woman standing on the porch . Chee parked as much of the car as he could in the scanty shade of a tamarisk and waited . It was a courtesy learned from boyhood in a society where modesty is prized , privacy is treasured , and visitors , even at a trading post , are all too rare . " You do n't just go run up to somebody 's hogan , " his mother had taught him . " You might see something you do n't want to see . " So Chee sat , without giving it a thought , to allow the residents of Badwater Wash to get in harmony with the idea of a visit from a tribal policeman , to button up and tidy up , or to do whatever was required by Navajo good manners . While he sat , perspiring freely , he looked in his rearview mirror at the people on the porch . Iron Woman had been joined by another woman , as thin and bent as Iron Woman was stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , seeming , in the dusty rearview glass , to be dressed exactly alike . Each wore a red sweatband around the forehead , a faded red plaid shirt , jeans , and cowboy60*boots . Iron Woman was saying something to the bent woman , who nodded and looked amused . The two young men , standing side by side , stared with implacable rudeness at Chee 's car . An old Ford sedan was parked at the corner of the building , a cinder block supporting the right rear axle . Beside it , perched high on its backcountry suspension , was a new GMC four-by-four . It was black with yellow pinstripes . Chee had priced a similar model in Farmington and could n't come close to affording it . He admired it now . A vehicle that would go anywhere . But richer than anything you expected to see parked at Badwater Wash . Through his windshield , beyond the thin screen of Russianolive leaves , the red mass of the cliff rose to the sky , reflecting the sun . The patrol car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was getting used to it , finding the anxiety familiar but not learning to like it . He got out of the car and walked toward the porch , keeping his eyes on the men , who kept their eyes on him. r rYa-tah-hey , " he said to Iron Woman . " Ya-tah , " she said . " I remember you . You 're the new policeman from Shiprock . " Chee nodded . " Out here the other day with the government officer seeingabout the Endocheeney business . " " Right , " Chee said . " This man is born to the Slow Talking People and born for the Salts , " Iron Woman told the bent woman . She named Chee 's mother , and his maternal aunt , and his maternal grandmother , and then recited his father 's side of the family . Bent Woman looked pleased . She faced Chee with her head back and her eyes almost closed , looking at him under her lids , a technique the descending blindness of glaucoma and cataracts taught its victims . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am born to the Bitter Water People , born for61*the Deer Spring Clan . My mother was Gray Woman Nez . " Chee smiled , acknowledging the relationship . It was vague  --  the Bitter Waters being linked to the Salt Clan and thereby to his father 's family . The system meant that Chee , and all other Navajos , had wholesale numbers of relatives . " On business ? " Iron Woman asked . " Just out poking around , " Chee said . " Seeing what I can see . " Iron Woman looked skeptical . " You do n't get out here much , " she said . " Nobody gets out here except on purpose . " Chee was aware of the two men watching him . Barely men . Late teens , he guessed . Obviously brothers , but not twins . The one nearest him had a thinner face , and a halfmoonof white scar tissue beside his left eye socket . Under the old rules of Navajo courtesy , they would have identified themselves first , since he was the stranger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old rules . " My clan is Slow Talking People , " Chee said to them . " Born for the Salt Dinee . " " Leaf People , " the thinner one said . " Born for Mud . " His face was sullen . Chee 's efficient nose picked up a whiff of alcohol . Beer . The Leaf Clan man let his eyes drift from Chee to study the police car . He gestured vaguely toward the other man . " My brother , " he said . " What 's happening over your way ? " Iron Woman asked . " I heard on the radio they had a knifing at a wedding over at Teec Nos Pos . One of the Gorman outfit got cut . Anything to that ? " Chee knew very little about that one  --  just what he 'd overheard before the morning patrol meeting . Normally he worked east and south out of Shiprock  --  not this mostly empty northwestern area . He put the beer ( possession illegalon the reservation ) out of his mind and tried to remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chee said . " Fella was fooling with a girl and she had a knife . Stuck him in the arm . I think she was a Standing Rock girl . Not much to it . " Iron Woman looked disappointed . " It got on the radio , though , " she said . " Lot of people around here related to the Gorman outfit . " Chee had gone to the battered red pop cooler just inside the front door , inserted two quarters , and tried to open the lid . " Takes three , " Iron Woman said . " Costs too much to get that stuff hauled way out here . And icing it down . Now everybody wants it cold . " " No more change , " Chee said . He fished out a dollar and handed it to Iron Woman . It was dark inside the store and much cooler . At the cash register , Iron Woman handed him four quarters . " Last time you were with that FBI man  --  asking about the one that got killed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking the name of the dead . " You find out who killed that man ? " Chee shook his head . " That fellow that came through here looking for him the day he was killed . Sounded to me like he did it . " " That 's a crazy thing , " Chee said . " We found that man at his hogan over in the Chuskas . A man they call Roosevelt Bistie . Bistie told us he came over here to kill that man who got killed . And the man Bistie was after was up on his roof fixing something , and Bistie shot at him and he fell off . But whoever killed the man did it with a butcher knife . " " That 's right , " Iron Woman said . " Sure as hell , it was a knife . I remember his daughter telling me that . " She shook her head , peered at Chee again . " Why would that fellow tell you he shot him ? " " We ca n't figure that out , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the man , but he wo n't say why . " ) 63 CIron Woman frowned . " Roosevelt Bistie , " she said . " Never heard of him . I remember when he stopped in here asking directions , I never had seen him before . The man 's kinfolks , do they know this Bistie ? " " None of them we 've talked to , " Chee said . He was thinking of how disapproving Kennedy would be if he could hear Chee discussing this case with a layman . Captain Largo too , for that matter , Largo having been a cop long enough to start acting secretive . But Kennedy was FBI to the bone , and the first law of the Agency was Say nothing to nobody . If Kennedy were here , listening to this Navajo talk , he 'd be waiting impatiently for a translation  --  knowing that Chee must be telling this woman more than she needed to know . However , Kennedy was n't here , and Chee had his own operatingtheory . The more you tell people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wants to be second in the business of telling things . Chee dropped in quarters and selected a Nehi Orange . Cold and wonderful . Iron Woman talked . Chee sipped . Outside , noonday heat radiated from the packed earth of the yard , causing the light to shimmer . Chee finished his soda pop . The four-by-four drove away with a roar , dust spurting from its wheels . Beer in the four-by-four , Chee guessed . Unlessthe boys had bought it here . But if Iron Woman was a bootlegger , he had n't heard it , and he had n't remembered seeing this place on the map Largo kept of liquor sources in his subagency territory . Beer in the morning , and an expensiverig to drive . Iron Woman had said the two were part of the Kayonnie outfit , which ran goats down along the San Juan to the north and sometimes worked in the oil fields . But Iron Woman obviously did not want to discuss the Kayonnieboys , her neighbors , with a stranger . The local murder victim was another matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a harmless old man . He stayed at home . Since his wife had died , he rarely came even as far as the64*trading post . Maybe two or three times a year , sometimes riding in on a horse , sometimes coming with a relative when a relative came to see him . No Endocheeney daughters to bring home their husbands , so the old man had lived alone . Only thing important she could remember happening involvinghim was a Red Ant Way sing done for him six or seven years ago to cure him of something or other after his woman died . In all the years she 'd been at Badwater , which was all her life , she could n't remember him getting into any kind of trouble , or being involved in bad problems . " Like getting your wood on somebody else 's wood-gathering place , or getting into some other family 's water , or running his sheep where they should n't be , or not helping out somebody that needed it . Never heard anything bad about him . Never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always tried to take care of his kinfolks , always there when somebody was having a sing . " " I do n't know if I ever told you that I have studied to be a yataalii myself , " Chee said . " I do the Blessing Way and some others . " He got out his billfold , extracted a card , and handed it to Iron Woman . The card said : THE BLESSING WAYand other ceremonials sungby a singer who studied with Frank Sam NakaiContact Jim CheeThe next lines provided his address and telephone numberat the Shiprock Police Station . He had mentioned this to the dispatcher , thinking he would square it with Captain Largo if the captain ever learned about it . So far , the risk seemed small . There had been no calls , and no letters . Iron Woman seemed to share the general lack of enthusiasm . She glanced at the card and laid it on the counter . " Everybody liked him , " Iron Woman said , getting back on the subject . " But now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her face reflected distaste . " Sons-abitches , " she added , clarifying that the distaste was not for skinwalkers but for the gossips . " When you live by yourself , people say things like that . " Or when you get stabbed to death , Chee thought . Violent death always seemed to provoke witch talk . " If everybody around here liked him , " Chee said , " then whoever killed him must have come from someplace else . Like Bistie . Did he know anybody anywhere else ? " " I do n't think so , " Iron Woman said . " Long as I been here , he only got one letter . " Chee felt a stir of excitement . Something at last . " You remember anything about it ? Who it was from ? " Of course she would remember . The arrival of any mail on this isolatedoutpost would be something to talk about , especially a letter to a man who never received letters and who could n't read them if he did . It would lie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cash register , the subject of conjecture and speculation until Endocheeney came in , or a relative showed up who might be trusted to deliver it to him . " Was n't from anybody , " Iron Woman said . " It was from the tribe . There in Window Rock . " The excitement evaporated . " One of the tribal offices ? " " Social Services , I think it was . One of those that are always messing around with people . " " How about his pawn ? " Chee asked . " Anything unusual in that ? " Iron Woman led him behind the counter , fished a key out of the folds of her voluminous reservation skirt , and unlocked the glass-topped cabinet where she kept the pawn . The Endocheeney possessions held hostage for credit includedone belt of heavy , crudely hammered conchas , oldfashionedand heavily tarnished ; a small sack containing66*nine old Mexican twenty-peso coins , their silver as tarnishedas the belt ; two sand-cast rings ; and a belt buckle of sand-cast silver . The buckle was beautiful , a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in its center . He turned it in his hand , admiringit . " And this , " Iron Woman said . She thumped a small deerskinpouch on the countertop and poured out a cluster of unset turquoise nuggets and fragments . " The old man made some jewelry now and then . Or he used to . Guess he got too old for it after the old woman died . " There was nothing remarkable about the turquoise . It was worth maybe two hundred dollars . Add another two hundred for the belt and maybe one hundred for the buckle and probably fifteen or twenty dollars each for the old pesos . They were once standard raw material for belt conchas on the reservation , and cheap enough , but Mexico had long since stopped making them , and the price of silver had soared . Nothing remarkable about any of this , except the beauty of the buckle . He wondered if Endocheeney had cast it himself . And he wondered why some of his kin had not claimed these belongings . Once , tradition would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that tradition was now often ignored . Or perhaps Endocheeney 's relatives did n't know about this pawn . Or perhaps they did n't have the cash to redeem it . " How much do you have on the old man 's bill ? " Chee asked . Iron Woman did n't have to look it up . " One hundred eighteen dollars , " she said . " And some cents . " Not much , Chee thought . Far less than the stuff was worth . Someone without any cash could raise that much by selling a few goats . " And then there 's them , " Iron Woman said . She tilted her head toward a corner behind the counter . There stood a67.4posthole digger , two axes , a pair of crutches , a hand-turned ice cream freezer , and what seemed to be an old car axle converted into a wrecking bar . Chee looked puzzled . " The crutches , " Iron Woman said impatiently . " He wanted to pawn them too , but hell , who wants crutches ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Badwater Clinic , so I did n't want to get stuck with ' em as pawn . Anyway , he just left ' em there . Said give him half if I could sell ' em . " " Was he hurt ? " Chee asked , thinking as he did that he could have found a smarter way to ask the question . Iron Woman seemed to think so too . " Broke his leg . Fell off of something and they had to put a cast on it over at the clinic and he came back with the crutches . " " And then he climbed right back on the roof , " Chee said . " Sounds like he was a slow learner . " " No , no , " Iron Woman said . " Broke his leg way last autumndoing something else . Think he fell off of a rail fence . Leg caught . " Iron Woman broke an imaginary stick with her fingers . " Snap , " she said . Chee was thinking of relatives who did n't come in and collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " They got a man that works on those old well pumps out there . " Iron Woman made a sweeping gesture with both hands to take in the entire plateau . " White man . He does that sometimes for people . Does n't mind about corpses . " " This witch talk . You hear that a long time or just now ? " Iron Woman looked uneasy . From what Chee had heard about her , she had gone to school over at Ganado , at the College of Ganado , a good school . And she was a Jew , more or less , raised in that religion . But she was also a Navajo , a member of the Halgai Dinee , the People of the Valley Clan . She did n't like talking about witches in any specific way with a stranger . " I heard about it just now , " she said . " Since the killing . " 68* " Was it just the usual stuff ? What you 'd expect when somebody gets killed ? " Iron Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , looked at Chee carefully . She shifted her weight and in the silence the creak of the floorboard plank under her shoe was a loud groaning sound . But her voice was so faint when she finally spoke that , even in the silence , he had to strain to hear . " They say that when they found him , they found a bone in the wound  --  where the knife had gone in . " " A bone ? " Chee asked , not sure that he 'd heard it . Iron Woman held her thumb and forefinger up  --  aneighth of an inch apart . " Little corpse bone , " she said . She did n't need to explain it more than that . Chee wasremembering the bone bead he 'd found in his trailer. 697DR . RANDALL JENKS HELD a sheet of paper in his fist . Presumably it was the laboratory report on the bead , since Jenks 's office had called Leaphorn to tell him the reportwas ready . But Jenks gave no sign he was ready to hand it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down himself besidethe long table in the meeting room . He wore a headband of red fabric into which the Navajo symbol of Corn Beetle had been woven . His blond hair was shoulder length and under his blue laboratory jacket Leaphorn could see the uniform  --  a frayed denim jacket . Leaphorn , who resented those who stereotyped Navajos , struggled not to stereotype others . But Dr. Jenks fell into Leaphorn 's category of Indian Lover . That meant he irritated Leaphorn even when he was doing him favors . Now Leaphorn was in a hurry . But he sat down . Jenks looked at him over his glasses . " The bead is made out of bone , " he said , checking for reaction . Leaphorn was not in the mood to pretend surprise . " I thought it might be , " he said . " Bovine , " Jenks said . " Modern but not new , if you know what I mean . Dead long enough to be totally dehydrated . Maybe twenty years , maybe a hundred  --  more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Leaphorn said . He got up , put on his hat . " Did you expect it to be human ? " Jenks asked . " Human bone ? " Leaphorn hesitated . He had work to do back at Window Rock  --  a rodeo that would probably be causing problems by now and a meeting of the Tribal Council that certainly would . Getting that many politicians together always caused some sort of problem . He wanted to confirm Emma 's appointment before he left the hospital , and talk to the neurologist about her if he could . And then there were his three homicides . Three and a half if you counted Officer Chee . Besides , he wanted to think about what he had just learned  --  that the bone was n't human . And what he had expected was none of Jenks 's business . Jenks 's business was public health , more specifically public health of the Navajos , Zunis , Acomas , Lagunas , and Hopis served by the U.S. IndianService hospital at Gallup . Jenks 's business , specifically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew more about so he would n't be asking favors of Jenks . " I thought it might be human , " Leaphorn said . " Any connection with Irma Onesalt ? " The question startled Leaphorn . " No , " he said . " Did you know her ? " Jenks laughed . " Not exactly . Not socially . She was in here a time or two . Wanting information . " " About pathology ? " Why would the Onesalt woman want information from a pathologist ? " About when a bunch of people died , " Jenks said . " She had a list of names . " " Who ? " " I just glanced at it , " Jenks said . " Looked like Navajo names , but I did n't really study it . " Leaphorn took off his hat and sat down. ) 71 " Tell me about it , " he said . " When she came in , everything you can remember . And tell me why this bone bead business made you think of Onesalt . " Dr. Jenks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one morning about two months earlier . Maybe a little longer . If it was important , maybe he could pin down the date . He had known her a little bit before . She had come to see him way back when the semiconductorplant was still operating at Shiprock  --  wanting to know if that kind of work was bad for the health . And he had looked stuff up for her a couple of times since . Jenks paused , getting his thoughts in order . " What kind of stuff ? " Leaphorn asked . Jenks 's long , pale face looked slightly embarrassed . " Well , one time she wanted some details about a couple of diseases , how they are treated , if hospitalization is needed , how long , so forth . And one time she wanted to know if an alcohol death we had in here might have been beaten . " Jenks did n't say beaten by whom . He did n't need to say . Irma Onesalt would have been interested , Leaphorn suspected , only if police , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Irma Onesalt did not like police , particularly Navajo Police . She called them Cossacks . She called them oppressors of The People . " This time she had a sheet of paper with her just names typed on it . She wanted to know if I could go back through my records and come up with the date each one had died . " " Could you ? " Leaphorn asked . " A few of them , maybe . Only if they had died in this hospital , or if we did the postmortem workup for some reason . But you know how that works . Most Navajo families wo n't allow an autopsy and usually they can stop it on religiousgrounds . I 'd have a record of it only if they died here , and then only if there was some good reason  --  like suspiciouscauses , or the FBI was interested , or something like that . " " She wanted to know cause of death ? " " I do n't think so . All she seemed to want was dates . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them all was the vital statistics offices in the state health departments . In Santa Fe and Phoenix and Salt Lake City . " " Dates , " Leaphorn said . " Dates of their death . " He frowned . That seemed odd . " She say why ? " Jenks shook his head , causing the long blond hair to sway . " I asked her . She said she was just curious about something . " Jenks laughed . " She did n't say what , but that little bone bead of yours made me think of her because she was talking about witchcraft . She said something about the problem with singers and the health situation . People gettingscared by the singers into thinking a skinwalker has witched them , and then getting the wrong medical treatment , or treatment they do n't need because they 're not reallysick . So when I saw your little bead I made the connection . " He studied Leaphorn to see if Leaphorn understood . " You know . Witches blowing a little piece of bone into somebody to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had anything to do with her list of names and what she was curious about . She said it was too early . She should n't talk about it yet  --  not then , she meant  --  and she said if anything came of it she would let me know . " " But she did n't come back ? " " She came back , " Jenks said . He looked thoughtful , runningthe tip of his thumb under the headband , adjusting it . " Must have been a couple of weeks before she got killed . This time she wanted to know what sort of treatment would be indicated for two or three diseases , and how long you 'd be hospitalized . Things like that the answer would mean to him . " One was TB , " Jenks said . " I remember that . And I think one was some sort of liver pathology . " He shrugged . " Nothingunusual . Sort of routine ailments we deal with around here , I remember that . " " And did she tell you then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people died ? " He was thinking of Roosevelt Bistie  --  the man who tried to kill Endocheeneytheman they had locked up at Shiprock , with not much reason to keep him , according to Kennedy 's report . RooseveltBistie had something wrong with his liver . But so did a lot of people . And what the hell could that mean , anyway ? " I was in a hurry , " Jenks said . " Two of our staff were on vacation and I was covering for one of them and I was trying to get my own operation caught up so I could go on vacation myself . So I did n't ask any questions . Just told her what she wanted to know and got rid of her . " " Did she ever explain it to you ? In any way at all ? " " When I got back from vacation  --  couple of weeks after that  --  somebody told me somebody had shot her . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . Shot her and left Leaphorn to guess why , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the motive  --  this further example of Irma Onesalt in the role of busybody , to use the belagana term for it . His mother would have called her , in Navajo , a " one who tells sheep which weed to eat . " Onesalt 's job in the Navajo Office of Social Services , obviously , had no more to do with death statistics than it did with the occupational hazards of the semiconductor plant or , to get closer to Leaphorn 's own emotionalscar tissue , with punishing bad judgment in the Navajo Tribal Police . " Do you think what she was working on had anything to do with why . . . " Jenks did n't complete the sentence . " Who knows , " Leaphorn said . " FBI handles homicides on Indian reservations . " He heard himself saying it , his voice curt and unfriendly , and felt a twinge of self-disgust . Why this animus against Jenks ? It was n't just that he felt Jenks 's attitude was patronizing . It was part of a resentment744against all doctors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them Emma , the only thing that mattered , they would know absolutely nothing . That was the principal source of this resentment . And it was n't fair to Jenks , or to any of them . Jenks had come to the Big Reservation , as many of the Indian Health Service doctors did , because the federal loans that had financed his education required two years in the military or the Indian Health Service . But Jenks had stayed beyond the two-year obligation , as some other IHS doctors did  --  delaying the Mercedes , the country club membership , the three-day work week , and the winters in the Bahamas  --  to help Navajos fight the battle of diabetes , dysentery , bubonic plague , and all those ailments that follow poor diets , bad water , and isolation . He should n't resent Jenks . Not only was n't it fair ; showing it would hurt his chances of learning everything Jenks could tell him . " However , " Leaphorn added , " we know something about it . And from what we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor do I , Leaphorn thought . Not about motive . Not about anything else . Certainly not about how to connect three and a half murders whose only connection seems to be an aimless lack of motive . " Maybe this list Irma had would help . All Navajo names , you said . Right ? Could you think of any of them ? " Jenks 's expression suggested he was probing his brain for names . All the homicide victims were still alive when Jenks had seen the list , Leaphorn thought , but would n't it be wonderful and remarkable if .. . " One was Ethelmary Largewhiskers , " Jenks said , faintly amused . " One was Woody 's Mother . " Leaphorn rarely allowed his face to show irritation , and he did n't now . These were exactly the sort of names he 'd expect Jenks to remember : names that were quaint , or cute , that would provoke a smile at a cocktail party somewhere when Dr. Jenks had become bored with Navajos  --  when too75afew of them drove wagons , and hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sheep , and too many drove station wagons and got their teeth straightened by the orthodontist . " Any others ? " Leaphorn asked . " It might be important . " Jenks put on the expression of a man trying hard for a recall . And failing . He shook his head . " Would you remember any , if you heard ? " Jenks shrugged . " Maybe . " " How about Wilson Sam ? " Jenks wrinkled his face . Shook his head . " Is n't he that guy who got killed early this summer ? " " Right , " Leaphorn said . " Was his name on the list ? " " I do n't remember , " Jenks said . " But he was still alive then . He did n't get killed until after Onesalt . If I remember it right , and I think I do because they did the autopsy at Farmington and the pathologist there called me about it . " " You 're right . I 'm just fishing around . How about Dugai Endocheeney ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he said . " I mean no , I ca n't remember . Been a long time . " He shook his head . Stopped the gesture . Frowned . " I 've heard the name , " he said . " Not on the list , I think , but . . . " He paused , adjusted the headband . " Was n't he a homicide victim too ? The other one that was killed about then ? " " Yes , " Leaphorn said . " Joe Harris did the autopsy too , at Farmington , " Jenks said . " He told me he got a dime out of one of the wounds . That 's why I remembered it , I guess . " " Harris found a dime in the wound ? " Harris was the San Juan County coroner working out of the Farmington hospital . Pathologists , like police , seemed to know one another and swap yarns . " He said Endocheeney got stabbed a bunch of times76*through the pocket of his jacket . In knifings we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever the knife happens to hit on the way in through the clothing . Buttons . Paper . Whatever . This time it hit a dime . " Leaphorn , whose memory was excellent , recalled reading the autopsy report in the FBI file . No mention of a dime . But there had been mention of " foreign objects , " which would cover a dime as well as the more usual buttons , thread , gravel , and broken glass . Could a knife punch a dime into a wound ? Easily enough . It seemed odd , but not unreasonable . " But Endocheeney was n't on the list . " " I do n't think so , " Jenks said . Leaphorn hesitated . " How about Jim Chee ? " he asked . Dr. Jenks thought hard again . But he could n't remember whether or not Jim Chee 's name was on the death date list. 3 77 , tsIT WAS ALMOST DARK when Chee pulled into the police parking lot in Shiprock . He parked where a globe willow would shade the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and weary , toward his pickup truck . He had left it that morning where another of the police department willows would shade it from the afternoon sun . Now the same tree hid it from the dim red twilight in a pool of blackness . The uneasiness Chee had shaken off at Badwater Wash and on the long drive home was suddenly back in possession . He stopped , stared at the truck . He could see only its shape in the shadows . He turned abruptly and hurried into the Police Building . Nelson McDonald was working the night shift , lounging behind the switchboard with the two top buttons of his uniformshirt open , reading the sports section of the FarmingtonTimes . Officer McDonald glanced up at Chee , nodded . " You still alive ? " he asked , with no hint of a smile . " So far , " Chee said . But he did n't think it was funny . He would later , perhaps . Ten years later . Crises past , in police work , tended to transmute themselves from fear into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear , a palpable something affecting the way Chee 's stomach felt . " I guess nobody noticed anyone tinkering around with my truck ? " 78*Officer McDonald sat up a little straighter , noticing Chee 's face and regretting the joke . " Nobody mentioned it , " he said . " And it 's parked right out there where everybody could see it . I do n't think . . . " He decided not to finish the sentence . " No messages ? " Chee asked . McDonald sorted through the notes impaled on a spindle on the clerk 's desk . " One , " he said , and handed it to Chee . " Call Lt. Leaphorn as soon as you get in , " it said , and listed two telephone numbers . Leaphorn answered at the second one , his home . " I want to ask you if you learned anything new about Endocheeney , " Leaphorn said . " But there 's a couple of other loose ends . Did n't you say you met Irma Onesalt just recently ? Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check my logs , " Chee said . " Probably in April . Late April . " " Did she say anything to you about a list of names she had ? About trying to find out what date the people on that list died ? " " No , sir , " Chee said . " I 'm sure I 'd remember something like that . " " You said you went to the Badwater Clinic and picked up a patient there and took him to a chapter meeting for her and they gave you the wrong man . And she was sore about it . That right ? " " Right . Old man named Begay . You know how it is with Begays . " How it was with Begays on the reservation is how it is with Smiths and Joneses in Kansas City or Chavezes in Santa Fe . It was the most common name on the reservation . " She said nothing about names ? Nothing about a list of names ? Nothing about how to go about finding out dates of deaths ? Nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chee said . " She just said a word or two when ) .79*I got to the chapter house . She was waiting . Wanted to know why I was late . Then she took the old man in to the meeting . I waited because I was supposed to take him back after he had his say . After a while , she came out and raised hell with me for bringing her the wrong Begay , and then he came out and got in and I took him back to the clinic . Not much of a chance for chatting . " " No , " Leaphorn said . " I had some dealing with the woman myself . " Chee heard the sound of a chuckle . " I imagineyou learned a few new dirty words ? " " Yes , sir , " Chee said . " I did . " A long silence . " Well , " Leaphorn said . " Just remember that a little while before she was shot she showed up at the pathologist 's office at the Gallup hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to find out when each of them died . If you hear anything that helps explain that , I want to know about it right away . " " Right , " Chee said . " Now . What did you learn out around Badwater ? " " Not much , " Chee said . " He had several hundred dollars ' worth of pawn left at the post there  --  a lot more than he owed for  --  and his kinfolks have n't picked it up . And he broke a leg last summer falling off a fence . Nothing much . " Silence again . Then Leaphorn said , in a very mild voice : " I 've got a funny way of working . Instead of telling me Not much , ' I like people to tell me all the details and then I 'll say , Well , that 's not much , ' or maybe I 'll say , Hey , that part about the pawn explains something else I heard . ' Or so forth . What I 'm saying is , give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so Chee , feeling slightly resentful , told Leaphorn of the bent woman , and the Kayonnie brothers with morning beer on their breath , and the letter from Window Rock , and the crutches which Iron Woman would n't accept as pawn and could n't sell , and all the other details . He finished , and804listened to a silence so long that he wondered if Leaphorn had put down the telephone . He cleared his throat . " That letter , " Leaphorn said . " From Window Rock . But what agency ? And when ? " " Navajo Social Services , " Chee said . " That 's what Iron Woman remembered . It came back in June . " " That 's who Irma Onesalt worked for , " Leaphorn said . " Oh , " Chee said . " Where 'd he get the crutches ? " " Badwater Clinic , " Chee said . " They set his leg . Guess they loan out their crutches . " " And do n't get them back , " Leaphorn said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir , " Chee said . Leaphorn noticed the tone . " You can see why I need the details . You have n't been working on the Onesalt case , so you had no way of knowing  --  or giving a damn  --  who she worked for . Now we have a link . Victim Onesalt wrote a letter to victim Endocheeney . Or somebody in her office did . " " That help ? " Leaphorn laughed . " I do n't see how . But nothing else helps , either . You figured out yet why you got shot at ? " " No , sir . " Another pause . " Something I want you to think about . " Silence . " I 'm going to bet you that when we find out who did it and why , it 's going to be based on something you know . You 're going to say , Hell , I should have thought of that . ' " " Maybe , " Chee said . But he thought about it as he put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotshot . But Leaphorn was wrong about this . He glanced at McDonald , immersed again in the Times . Chee had come in mostly to get the station 's portable spotlightout of the storeroom and shine it on his truck . But now , in this well-lit room with his friend waiting behind the newspaper , curious and embarrassed , doing that seemed ridicu-81*lous . Instead he went to his typewriter and pounded out a note to Largo . To : Commanding OfficerFROM : CheeSUBJECT : Investigation thefts from vehicles at tourist parking sites and theft of drip gasoline in Aneth field . At Badwater Wash Trading Post ran into two young men , Kayonnie family , driving a new GMC 4 x 4 and drinking in the morning . Am told they are unemployed . Will check more out there again . He initialed the memo and handed it to Officer McDonald . " Going home , " he said , and left . He stood a moment in the darkness beyond the entrance until his eyes adjusted enough to make his pickup visible . By then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to that truck in the darkness , and then of driving into the darkness surrounding his trailer , was more than he wanted to handle . He 'd walk . It was less than two miles from the station down along the river to his homesite under the cottonwoods . An easy walk , even at night . It would work out the stiffness of a day spent mostly in his patrol car . He trotted across the asphalt of U.S. 666 and found the path that led toward the river . Chee was a fast walker and normally this trip took less than thirty minutes . Tonight , moving soundlessly , he took almost forty and used another ten carefully scouting , pistol in hand , the places around his trailer where someone with a shotgun might wait . He found nothing . That left the trailer itself . He paused behind a juniper and studied it . Light from a half-moon made the setting a pattern of cottonwood shadows . The only sound on the breezeless air was a truck changinggears on the highway far behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Colorado . As to whether someone with a shotgun was waiting in the trailer , Chee could think of no safe way to answer that question . He 'd left the door locked , but the lock would be easy to pick . He slipped the pistol out of its holster again , thinking that this was a hell of a way to live , thinking that he might give up on the trailer , walk back to the station , get his patrol car , and spend the night in a motel , thinking that he might just say to hell with it and walk up to the door , pistol cocked , and unlock it , and go in . Then he remembered the cat . The cat was probably out hunting the nocturnal rodents it had lived on until Chee began supplementing its diet with his table scraps . But maybe not . Maybe it was still a little early for rodents and the predators that hunt them . More than once when he had risen early he 'd seen Cat returning to its den about dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The juniper under which Cat made its home was along the slope to Chee 's left . He picked up a handful of dirt and gravel and threw it into the bush . Later , he thought that the cat must have been crouched , alert , under the juniper listening to his prowling . It shot from the bush , moving almost too fast to be seen in the poor light for its refuge in the trailer . He heard the clack-clack of the cat door . He relaxed . No one would be waiting for him inside . But now he knew he could n't sleep in the trailer . He got out his sleeping bag , packed his toothbrush and a change of clothing , and walked back to the police station . He was tired now , and the incident of the cat had broken the tension . The fear that had lived in his truck was gone now . It was simply a friendly , familiar vehicle . He unlocked the door , climbed in , and started the engine . He drove across the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the Chuskas loomingin the moonlight to the south . Just past Behclahbeto , he pulled onto the shoulder , turned off his lights , and waited. 83*The car lights he 'd noticed miles behind him turned out to belong to a U-Haul truck , which roared past him and disappearedover the hill . He restarted his engine and turned onto a dirt road that jolted through the dusty sagebrush and dipped into an arroyo . Up the arroyo , he parked and rolled out his sleeping bag . He lay on his back , looking up at the stars , thinking about the nature of fear and how it affected him , and about what Iron Woman had told him of the bone being found in Dugai Endocheeney . It could be false , one of those witch rumors that spring up like tumbleweeds after rain when bad things happen . Or it could be true . Perhaps someone thought he had been witched by Endocheeney , and had killed him and returned the bone of corpse poison to reverse the witching . Or it could be that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its marker . In eithercase , how would the people at Badwater Wash have learned of it ? Chee considered that and found an answer . The bone would have shown up in the autopsy . The surgeon would have seen it only as a piece of foreign matter lodged in the wound . But it was odd , and he would have mentioned it . The word would have spread . A Navajo would have heard it  --  a nurse , an orderly . To a Navajo , any Navajo , the significancewould have been apparent . The word of the bone would have reached Badwater Wash with the speed of light . So why had n't he mentioned the bone gossip to the lieutenant who insisted on knowing every detail ? Chee examined his motives . It was too vague to mention , he thought , but the real reason was his expectation of Leaphorn 's reaction to anything associated with witchery . Ah , well , perhaps he would mention it to Leaphorn the next time he saw him . Chee rolled onto his side , seeking comfort and sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bistie was being held until the federals could decide what to do with him . He would try to get Bistie to talk about witchcraft. 1Ad. ( 9 " I THINK YOU 'RE TOO LATE , " the officer on the jail information desk telephone said . " I think his lawyer 's coming to get him . " " Lawyer ? " Chee asked . " Who ? " " Somebody from DNA , " the deputy said . " Some woman . She 's driving over from Shiprock . " " So am I , " Chee said , checking his memory for the name to go with the deputy 's voice , and finding it . " Listen , Fritz , if she gets there first , maybe you could stall around a little . Take some time getting him checked out . " " Maybe so , Jim , " Fritz said . " Sometimes people say we 're slow . Can you be here by nine ? " Chee glanced at his watch . " Sure , " he said . From the police station in Shiprock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove it , Chee consideredhow he would deal with the lawyer , or try to deal with her . DNA was the popular acronym for Dinebeiina Nahiilna be Agaditahe , which translates roughly into " People Who Talk Fast and Help the People Out , " and which was the Navajo Nation 's version of Legal Aid Society/public defenderorganization . Earlier in its career it had attracted mostly young militant social activists whose relationship with the Navajo Tribal Police had ranged from icy to hostile. 85*Things had improved gradually . Now , generally , the iciness had modified to coolness , and the hostility to suspicion . Chee expected no trouble . However .. . The young woman in the white silk shirt sitting against the wall in the D Center reception room was looking at him with something stronger than suspicion . She was small , skinny , a Navajo , with short black hair and large angry black eyes . Her expression , if not hostile , showed active distaste . " You 're Chee , " she said , " the arresting officer ? " " Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a handshakein midmotion . " Not the arresting officer , technically . The federal  --  " " I know that , " said Silk Shirt , getting to her feet with a graceful motion . " Did Agent Kennedy explain to you . . . did Agent Kennedy explain to Mr. Bistie . . . that a citizen , even a Navajo citizen , has a right to consult with an attorney before he undergoes a cross-examination ? " " We read him  --  " " And do you know , " Silk Shirt asked , forming each word with icy precision , " that you have absolutely no legal right to hold Mr. Bistie here in this jail with no charge against him whatsoever , and knowing that he did n't commit the homicide you arrested him for , just because you want to talk to him ' ? " " He 's being held for investigation , " Chee said , aware that his face was flushed , aware that Officer Fritz Langer of the Farmington Police Department was standing there behind the reception desk , watching all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eye he could see Langer was not only listening , he was grinning . " He admitted taking a shot  --  " " Without advice of counsel , " Silk Shirt said . " And now , just at your request and without any legal grounds at all , 86*Mr . Bistie is being held here by the police while you take your time driving over from Shiprock so you can talk to him . Just a favor from one good old boy to another . " The grin disappeared from Langer 's face . " The paperwork , " he said . " It takes time when the federals are in-volved . " " Paperwork , my butt , " Silk Shirt snapped . " It 's the good old boy network at work . " She pointed a thumb in Chee 's direction , something one polite Navajo did not do to another . " Your buddy here calls you and says keep him locked up until I can get around to talking to him . Stall around all day if you have to . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how the Federal Bureau of Investigation is about crossing all the is and dotting the i 's . " " Well , Mr. Chee is here now . Can you get the i dotted and release Mr. Bistie ? " Langer made a wry face at Chee , lifted the telephone , and talked to someone . " He 'll be out in a minute , " he said . He reached under the counter , extracted a brown paper grocery bag , and put it on the countertop . It bore the legend R. BISTIE , WEST WING in red Magic Marker . Chee felt a yearning to explore that paper sack . He should have thought of it earlier . Much earlier . Before Silk Shirt arrived . He smiled at Silk Shirt . " All I need is just a few minutes . Just some information . " " About what ? " " Well , " Chee said , " if we knew why Bistie wanted to kill Endocheeney  --  and he says he wanted to kill him , " he insertedhastily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did kill Endocheeney . Stabbed Endocheeney . Later . " " Make an appointment , " Silk Shirt said . " Maybe he 'll want to talk to you . " She paused , looking at Chee . " And maybe he won't. " 87 Q " I guess we could pick him up again , " Chee said . " As a material witness . Something like that . " " I guess you could , " she said . " But it better be legal this time . Now he 'll be represented by someone who understands that even a Navajo has some constitutional rights . " Roosevelt Bistie came through the door , trailed by an elderly jailer . The jailer patted him on the shoulder . " Come see us , " he said , and disappeared back through the doorway . " Mr. Bistie , " Silk Shirt said . " I am Janet Pete . We were told you needed legal counsel and the DNA sent me over to represent you . To be your lawyer . " Bistie nodded to her . " Ya-tah-hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nodded . Smiled . " I do n't need no lawyer , " he said . " They told me somebody else killed the son-of-a-bitch . I missed him . " Bistie chuckled when he said it , but to Chee he still looked sick . " You need a lawyer to tell you to be careful what you say , " Janet Pete said , glancing at Chee . And then , to Langer : " And we need a place where my client and I can talk . In private . " " Sure , " Langer said . He handed Bistie the sack and pointed . " Down the hall . First door to the left . " " Miss Pete , " Chee said . " When you 're talking to your client , would you ask him if I can talk to him for a minute or two ? Otherwise ... " " Otherwise what ? " " Otherwise I 'll have to drive all the way up into the Lukachukaisto his place and talk to him there , " Chee said meekly . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him earlier . " " I 'll see , " Janet Pete said , and disappeared down the hall after Bistie . Chee looked out the window . The lawn needed water . What was it about white men that caused them to plant grass in places where grass could n't possibly grow without88*them fiddling with it all the time ? Chee had thought about that a lot , and talked to Mary Landon about it . He 'd told Mary he thought it represented a subconscious need to remindthemselves that they could defy nature . Mary said no , it was n't need for remembered beauty . Chee looked at the lawn , and at the desert country visible across the San Juan beyond it . He preferred the desert . Today even the fringe of tumbleweeds along the sidewalk looked wilted . Dry heat everywhere and the sky almost cloudless . " I did n't tell her you 'd asked me to stall , " Langer said , apologetically . " She figured that out for herself . " " Oh , well , " Chee said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A thought materialized abruptly . " You remember what was in Bistie 's sack ? " Langer looked surprised at the question . He shrugged . " Usual stuff . Billfold . Keys to his truck . Pocket knife . One of those little deerskin sacks some of you guys carry . Handkerchief . Nothing unusual . " " Did you look in the billfold ? " " We have to inventory the money , " Langer said . He sorted through papers on a clipboard . " Had a ten and three ones and seventy-three cents in change . Driver 's license . So forth . " " Anything else you remember ? " " I did n't check him in , " Langer said . " Al did . On the evening shift . Says here : Nothing else of value . ' " Chee nodded . " What you looking for ? " " Just fishing , " Chee said . " Speaking of which , " Langer said , " can you get a permit for fishing up there at Wheatfields Lake ? Free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess you know  --  " Janet Pete appeared at the hall door . " He 's says he 'll talk to you . " " I thank you , " Chee said. 89*The room held a bare wooden table and two chairs . RooseveltBistie sat in one of them , eyes half closed , face sagging . But he returned Chee 's salutation . Chee put his hand on the back of the other chair , glanced at Janet Pete . She was leaning against the wall behind Bistie , watching Chee . The paper sack was under Bistie 's chair . " Could we talk in private ? " Chee asked her . " I 'm Mr. Bistie 's legal counsel , " she said . " I 'll stay . " Chee sat down , feeling defeated . It had never been likely that Bistie would talk . He had n't , after all , in the past . It was even less likely that he would talk about the subject Chee intended to raise , which was witchcraft . There was a simple enough reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even have their evil business discussed . Therefore the prudent Navajo discussed witchcraft , if at all , only with those known and trusted . Not with a stranger . Certainly not with two strangers . However , there was no harm in trying . " I have heard something which I think you would like to know , " Chee said . " I will tell you what I heard . And then I will ask you a question . I hope you will give me an answer . But if you wo n't , you wo n't . " Bistie looked interested . So did Janet Pete . " First , " Chee said , speaking slowly , intent on Bistie 's expression , " I will tell you what the people over at the BadwaterWash Trading Post hear . They hear that a little piece of bone was found in the body of that man you took a shot at . " There was a lag of a second or two . Then Bistie smiled a very slight smile . He nodded at Chee . Chee glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know if this is true , " Chee said . " I will go to the hospital where the body of that man was taken and I will try to find out if it was true . Should I tell you what I find out ? " No smile now . Bistie was studying Chee 's face . But he nodded . " Now I have a question for you to answer . Do you have a little piece of bone ? " Bistie stared at Chee , face blank . " Do n't answer that , " Janet Pete said . " Not until I find out what 's going on here . " She frowned at Chee . " What 's this all about ? It sounds like an attempt to get Mr. Bistie to incriminatehimself . What are you driving at ? " " We know Mr. Bistie did n't kill Endocheeney , " Chee said . " Somebody else killed him . We do n't know who . We are n't likely to find out who until we know why . Mr. Bistie here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he tried to do it . Maybe it was the same reason . Maybe it was because Endocheeney was a skinwalker . Maybe he witched Mr. Bistie . Put the witch bone into him . Maybe Endocheeney witched somebody else . If what I heard at BadwaterWash is n't just gossip , maybe Mr. Endocheeney had a bone put in him because that other person , the one who knifed Endocheeney , put it in him when he stabbed Endocheeneyto turn the witching around . " Chee was talking directly to Janet Pete , but he was watching Bistie from the corner of his eye . If Bistie 's face revealed any emotion , it was satisfaction . " It sounds like nonsense to me , " Janet Pete said . " Would you recommend to your client that he answer my question , then ? " Chee asked . " Did he believe Mr. Endocheeneywas a witch ? " " I 'll talk to him about this , " she said . " There are no charges against him . None . He 's not accused of anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About a murder , " Chee said . " And there may be a charge filed by now . Attempted homicide . " " Based on what ? " Janet Pete asked . " On what he told you and Kennedy before consulting with his attorney ? That 's absolutely all you have . " " That , and some other stuff , " Chee said . " Witnesses who put him where it happened . His license number . The ejectedshell from his rifle . " Which , as far as Chee knew , had n't been found and was n't being looked for . Why look for a shell casing from a shot that missed when they had a butcher knife , which did n't miss ? But Janet Pete would n't know they had n't found it . " I do n't think there 's any basis for charges , " Janet Pete said . Chee shrugged . " It 's not up to me . I think Kennedy  --  " " I think I will call Kennedy , " Janet Pete said . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , stopped with her hand on the knob , smiled at Chee . " Are you coming ? " " I 'll just wait , " Chee said . " Then my client is coming , " she said . She motioned to Bistie . He got up , steadied himself with a hand on the tabletop . " This interview is over , " Janet Pete said , and she closed the door behind them . Chee waited . Then he went to the door and glanced down the hall . Janet Pete was using the telephone in the pay booth . Chee closed the door again , picked up Bistie 's sack , sorted quickly through it . Nothing interesting . He extracted Bistie 's billfold . In it , in the corner of the currency pocket that held a ten and three ones , Chee found a bead . He turned it over betweenthumb and first finger , examining it . Then he put it back where he had found it , put the wallet back in the sack , and the sack back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made of bone . In fact , it looked exactly like the one he 'd found on the floor of his trailer. 92  --  *10THE TURBULENCE CAUSED BY THE THUNDERHEADwas sweeping across the valley floor toward them . It kicked up an opaque gray-white wall of dust which obscured the distant shape of Black Mesa and spawned dust devils in the caliche flats south of them . They were standing , Officer Al Gorman and Joe Leaphorn , beside Gorman 's patrol car on the track that led across the sagebrush flats below Sege Butte toward Chilchinbito Canyon . " Right here , " Gorman said . " Here 's where he parked his car , or pickup , or whatever . " Leaphorn nodded . Gorman was sweating . A trickle of it ran down his neck and under his shirt collar . It was partly the heat , and partly that Gorman should lose a few pounds , and partly , Leaphorn knew , because he made Gorman nervous . " Tracks lead right back here . " Gorman pointed . " From over there near the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down that slope there , where the shale outcrops are , and then across the sagebrush right up to here . " Leaphorn grunted . He was watching the dust storm movingdown the valley with its outrider of whirlwinds . One of them had crossed a gypsum sink , and its winds had sucked93*up that heavier mineral . The cone changed from the yellowgrayof the dusty earth to almost pure white . It was the sort of thing Emma would have noticed , and found beauty in , and related in some way or other to the mythology of The People . Emma would have said something about the Blue Flint Boys playing their games . They were the yei personalitiescredited with stirring up whirlwinds . He would describeit to her tonight . He would if she was awake and aware  --  and not in that vague world she now so often retreatedinto . Beside him , Gorman was describing the sign he had followedfrom killing scene to car , and the sign the car had left , and his conclusion that the killer had raced away . " Spun his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tore it up . Threw dirt . And then , right down there , he backed around and drove on back toward the road . " " Where was the killing ? " " See that little bunch of juniper ? Look across the shale slope , and then to the right . That man ... " Gorman stopped , glanced at Leaphorn for a reading of whether the lieutenant would allow him to avoid " wearing out the name " of a dead man . He made his decision and restated the sentence . " That 's where Wilson Sam was , by the juniper . Looked like it was a regular stopping place for him when he was out with the sheep . And the killer got him about twenty-five , thirty yards to the right of those junipers . " " Looks like he took sort of a roundabout way to get back here , then , " Leaphorn said . " If he circled all the way around and came down that shale . " " Looks that way , " Gorman said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it from here because of the way the land folds , but if you try to go straight across , then over that ridge there  --  the ridge that shale is in  --  over that there 's an arroyo . Cut deep . To get across it you got to skirt way up , or way down , where there 's sheep crossing . So the short way  --  " 94*Leaphorn interrupted him . " Did he go the same way he came back ? " Gorman looked puzzled . Leaphorn rephrased the question , partly to clarify his own thinking . " When he drove along here , we 'll say he was looking for Sam . Hunting him . He sees Sam , or maybe just the flock of sheep Sam was watching , over there across the flats by the junipers . This is as close as he can get a vehicle . So he parks here . Gets out . Heads for Sam . You say the fastest way to get there is angling way to the right , and then up that shale slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across an arroyo at a sheep crossing , and then swing left again . Long way around , but quickest . And that 's the way he came back . But is that the way he went ? " " Sure , " Gorman said . " I guess so . I did n't notice . I was n't looking for that . Just tracking him to see where he went . " " Let 's see if we can find out , " Leaphorn said . It would n't be easy , but for the first time since he 'd awakened that morning , with the homicides instantly on his mind , he felt a stirring of hope . This might be a way to learn whether or not the person who 'd killed Wilson Sam was a stranger to Sam 's territory . Small though that would be , it would satisfy Leaphorn 's quota for this unpromising day . Leaphorn had given himself the quota as he 'd eaten his breakfast : Before the day was done , he would add one single hard fact to what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl of cornmeal mush , a piece of Emma 's fried bread , and some salami from the refrigerator . Emma , who for all the almost thirty years of their marriage had risen with the dawn , was still asleep . He 'd dressed quietly , careful not to disturb her . She 'd lost weight , he thought . Not eating . Before Agnes had come to help , she would simply forget to eat when he was n't home . He would make her a lunch before he left for the office and find it untouched when he came home at the95*end of the day . Now she would sometimes forget to eat even when the food was on her plate in front of her . " Emma , " he would say . " Eat . " And she would look at him with that embarrassed , confused , disoriented smile and say , " It 's good , but I forget . " He had looked down at her as he buttoned his shirt , seeing an unaccustomed hollowness below the cheekbones , under the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always have the same smooth roundness he 'd noticed that day he first saw her  --  walking with two other Navajo girls across the campus at Arizona State . Arizona State . His mother had buried his umbilical cord at the roots of a pinon beside their hogan  --  the traditional Navajo ritual for binding a child to his family and his people . But for Leaphorn , Emma was the tie . A simple physical law . Emma could not be happy away from the Sacred Mountains . He could not be happy away from Emma . He had frowned down at her , studying her , seeing the flatness of her cheek , the lines under her eyes and at the corners of her mouth . ( " I 'm feeling fine , " she would say . " I never felt better . You must not have any work to do down at the police to be worrying about me all the time . " ) But now she would admit the headaches . And there was no way she could hide the forgetfulness , nor those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , from some bad dream . Day after tomorrow was the appointment . At 2 P.M. They would leave early , and drive to Gallup , and check her in at the Indian Health Service hospital . And then they would find out . Now there was no reason to think about it , about what it might be . No reason to let his mind reexamine again and again and again all he had heard and read of the horrors of Alzheimer 's disease . Maybe it was n't that . But he knew it was . He 'd called the toll-free number of the Alzheimer 's Disease and Related DisordersAssociation and they had sent him a package of information. 96* ... initially a patient with AD exhibits the following symptoms : 1 . Forgetfulness. 2 . Impairment of judgment. 3 . Inability to handle routine tasks. 4 . Lack of spontaneity. 5 . Lessening of initiative. 6 . Disorientation of time and place. 7 . Depression and terror. 8 . Disturbance of language. 9 . Episodic confusional states . He had read it in the office , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of always thinking today was his day off , the lethargy , the trouble with getting the garbage bag installed in the garbage can , the preparation for Agnes 's arrival two days after Agnes had arrived . Worst of all , his awakening in the night to find Emma clutching at him , frantic with some nightmare fear . He had , as was his fashion , made notes on the margin . Emma had scored nine for nine . Leaphorn had every reason to think of something else . And so that morning he had thought , first , of Irma Onesalt'slist of the dead , and why death dates would be important to her . As he left Emma still sleeping he heard Agnes stirring in her room . He drove to his office in the clear , sunrise light of another day of heat and drought . Dust was already rising from the rodeo grounds down at the highway intersection  --  the dust of stock feeding . Sometime today he would think of the rodeo and the myriad of problems it always brought . Now he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed a letter to go to the various county health departments in Arizona , New Mexico , and Utah that would have been contacted by Onesalt if she followed the advice of Dr. Randall Jenks . It was too complicated , and too sensitive , to be handled by the half-dozen tele-.97  --  *phone calls it would require . And there was no real urgency . So he put the letter together  --  very carefully . He explained who he was , explained that the investigation of the murder of Irma Onesalt was involved , described the list as best he could , trying to recall for them the question she might have asked . Finally , with these needed preliminaries out of the way , he inquired if anyone in the department had received a letter or a telephone call from Ms. Onesalt concerning these names , asking death dates . If so , could he have a copy of the letter , or the name of the person who had handled the telephone call , so he could question that person more closely . He wrote a clean copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listing to whom copies should be sent . That done , he considered what Jenks had told him about Chee 's bone bead . It was made of cow bone . A witch , if one believed bona fide witches existed , would have used human bone , presuming the bona fide witch believed Navajo witchcraft mythology in a literal meaning . So if a real witch was involved , presuming such existed , said witch had been swindledby his bone supplier . On the other hand , if someone was merely pretending to be a witch , such things did n't matter . Those who believed witches magically blew bone particles into their victims would hardly subject said bone to the microscope . And of course , cow-bone beads would be easy to get . Or would they ? It seemed likely . Every slaughterhouse would produce mountains of cattle bones . Raw material for mass producing beads for the costume jewelry market . Leaphornfound his thought process leading him into the economicsof producing bone beads as opposed to molding plasticbeads . Chee 's bone beads would certainly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenks had said the bead was fairly old . Perhaps the FBI , with its infiniteresources , could track down the source . But he could n't imagine how . He tried to imagine Delbert Streib phrasing 98*the memo about corpse poison and witches to touch off such an effort . Streib would simply laugh at the idea . Leaphorn wrote another memo , instructing Officer Jimmy Tso , who handled liaison with the Gallup police department , to check suppliers for jewelry makers , pawnshops , and wherever else he could think of , to learn how a Navajo/Zuni/Hopi jewelry maker might obtain beads , and particularly bone beads . He dropped that memo in his outbasketatop the drafted letter . Then he extracted his homicidefolders from the cabinet , put them on his desk , and looked at them . He pushed the Onesalt file aside . Onesalt had been the first to die . Something in his instinct told him she was the key , and he knew her file by heart . It baffled him . It seemed as lacking in purpose as death by lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy People . He picked up the file labeled WILSON SAM , opened it , and read . He saw nothing that he had n't remembered . But when he 'd first read it , he had n't noticed that the tribal policeman working with Jay Kennedy on this investigation was Officer Al Gorman . The name then had meant nothing to him . It had simply identified a new , probably young , officer whom Leaphorn did not know . Now the name carried with it a visual image . Leaphorn put the file on the desk and looked out his window at the early morning sunlight on the scattered roofs of Window Rock village . Gorman . The plump cop walking across the Shiprock parking lot with Chee and Benaly . Chee instantly conscious of the parked car , of what car it was , of its occupants , all with hardly a glance . But the walk became a little stiffer , the shoulders a little straighter , knowing he was watched . Benaly becoming aware of Chee 's awareness , noticing the car , not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oblivious . Blind to everything except the single thought that occupied him . Officer Gorman had never ) .99*noticed Leaphorn sitting in the shade in his car . If he missed that , what had he missed at the scene of Wilson Sam 's death ? Maybe nothing , but it was worth checking . To be honest , perhaps he should say it gave him an excuse . It was nine minutes until eight . In nine minutes his telephonewould start ringing . The world of the troublesome rodeo , the Tribal Council meeting , indignant school principals , bootleggers , too few men and too many assignments , would capture him for another day . He looked past the clock at the world outside the window , the highway leading away over the ridge toward everywhere but Window Rock , the world in which his job had once allowed him to pursue his own curiosity and to hell with the paper work . He picked up the telephone and called the Shiprock station . He asked for Officer Al Gorman . Now it was early afternoon . Gorman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trading Post . They 'd made the bone jarring drive back into the Chilchinbito Canyon country . Rather quickly , Officer Gorman had proved he was the sort of man who  --  as Leaphorn 's grandmother would have said  --  counted the grass and did n't see the grazing . Gorman was sitting now in Leaphorn 's car , waiting ( uneasily , Leaphorn hoped ) for Leaphorn to finish whatever the hell Leaphorn was doing . What Leaphorn was doing was looking past the grass at the grazing . They had established by two hours of dusty work that the route the killer had taken to reach the growth of junipers where Wilson Sam was waiting was very different from his return route . Brokentwigs here , dislodged rocks there , a footprint sheltered enough to survive two months of rainless days , showed them that he had headed in an almost straight line through the sagebrush toward the junipers . He had crossed the ridge , maintaining that direction except when heavy brush forced a detour , until he reached the arroyo . He had walked down 100 *its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing point . Then he had reversed direction almost a quarter mile , to cross at a sheep trail  --  the same trail he 'd used on his return trip . Leaphorn spent the remainder of the morning having Gorman show him just what he had found , and where he had found it , when Gorman had worked this scene for Kennedy early in the summer . Gorman had showed him where WilsonSam 's body had been found on the bottom of the narrow wash draining into Chilchinbito . He had pointed out the remains of the little rock slides that showed Sam had been tumbled down from above . The rainless summer had left the sign pretty much undigturbed . Ants had carried away most of the congealed blood from the sand where the body had lain , but you could still find traces . In this protected bottom , the winds had only smoothed the tracks of those who had come to carry Sam away . Above , the scouring had been more complete . Gorman had shown Leaphorn where Sam had been and where the killer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , " Gormansaid . " The ground was softer then . Sam had boots on . Flat heels . Easy to match them with his tracks . And the other fellow had on cowboy boots . " He glanced at Leaphorn . " Bigger . Maybe size eleven . " All that had been in Kennedy 's report . So had the answer to the question Leaphorn had decided to ask . But he wanted to hear it for himself . " And they did n't stand and talk at all ? No sign of that ? " " No , sir , " Gorman said . " No sign of that . When I tracked the suspect back , it showed he started running about forty yards out there . " Gorman had pointed into the sparse sagebrush to the south . " No more heel prints . He was run-ning . " " And Sam ? Where did he start running away ? " Gorman showed him . Sam had not run far . Perhaps ) 101*twenty-five yards . Old men are poor runners , even when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leaphorn stood where the killer had parked and stared across the broken landscape toward the junipers where this person must have seen Sam , or Sam 's sheep . He stood with his lower lip held between his teeth , nibbling thoughtfully , trying to recreate what the killer must have been thinking , retracing with his eyes the route the man had taken . " Let 's make sure we agree  --  that I 'm not overlooking anything , " Leaphorn said . " He 's driving along here . He sees Sam , or maybe Sam 's flock , over there by the junipers . He parks . He heads directly toward Sam . " Leaphorn glanced at Gorman , saw no sign of disagreement . " In a hurry , I 'd say , because of the way he crashed through the sagebrush . He did n't know the arroyo was there behind the ridge , and could n't get across it there , so he had to skirt upstream to where the banks get lower . " " Not too smart , " Gorman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being smart had nothing to do with it . " And when he got close to Sam he was in such a hurry to kill him that he started running . Right ? " " I 'd say so , " Gorman said . " Why did Sam start running ? " " Scared , " Gorman said . " Maybe the guy was yelling at him . Or waving that shovel he killed him with . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . " That 's what I 'd guess . When we catch him , who do you think it will turn out to be ? " Gorman shrugged . " No way of telling , " he said . " It 'd be a man . Big , man-sized feet . Probably some kinfolks or other . " He looked at Leaphorn , smiling slightly . " You know how it is . It 's always some sort of fight with some of his wife 's folks , or some fight with some neighbor over where he 's grazing his sheep . That 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it always was . But this time it was n't . " Think about him not knowing the arroyo was there . Not knowing where to find the sheep crossing , " Leaphorn said . " That tell you anything ? " Gorman 's pleasant round face looked puzzled . He thought . " I did n't think about that , " he said . " I guess it was n't a neighbor . Anybody lives around here , they 'd know how the land lays . How it drains . " " So our man was a stranger . " " Yeah , " Gorman said . " That 's funny . Think it will help any ? " Leaphorn shrugged . He could n't see how . It did form a sort of crazy harmony with the Endocheeney affair . Bistie and Endocheeney seemed to have been strangers . What did that mean ? But he 'd met his quota . He 'd added one fact to his homicide data . Wilson Sam had been killed by a stranger. 10311AFTER MANY PAINSTAKING RECONSIDERATIONS , Jim Chee finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bone bead in Roosevelt Bistie 's billfold . He had walked out of the visiting room and closed the door behind him , leaving Bistie 's paper sack of belongings on the floor beside the chair , exactly where Bistie had put it . Then he stood by the door , looking at Bistie with a curiosity intensifiedby the thought that Bistie had tried to blast him out of bed with a shotgun . Bistie was sitting on the hard bench against the wall looking out of the window at something , his face in profile to Chee . Chee memorized him . A witch ? Why had this man fired the shotgun through the skin of his trailer ? He looked no different from any other human , of course . None of those special characteristics that the white culture sometimes gives its witches . No pointy nose , sharp features , broomstick . Just another man whose malice had led him to try to kill . To shoot Dugai Endocheeney , a stranger , on the roof of his hogan . To shoot Jim Chee , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam amid his sheep . As Bistie sat now , slumped on the bench , Chee had no luck relating his shape to the shape he had seen , or dreamed he had seen , in the darkness outside his trailer . His only impression had been that the shape had been small. 104 *Bistie seemed a little larger than the remembered shape . Could Bistie actually be the man ? Bistie lost interest in whatever he 'd been watching through the window and glanced down the hall toward Chee . Their eyes met . Chee read nothing in Bistie 's expressionexcept a mild and guarded interest . Then the door of the phone booth pushed open and Janet Pete emerged . Chee walked down the hall , away from her , and out the exit into the parking lot and to his car , away from all the impulsive actions his instinct urged . He wanted to rearrest Bistie . He wanted to take the wallet and confront Bistie  --  in front of witnesses  --  with the bone bead . He wanted to make Bistie 's possession of the bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one 's billfold was legal enough . And Chee had absolutelyno right to know it was there . He 'd found it in an illegal search . There was a law against that . But not against bone possession or  --  for that matter  --  against being a Skinwalker . Having thought of nothing he could do , he sat in his car waiting for Pete and Bistie to emerge . Maybe they would leave without Bistie 's sack . Simply forget it . If that happened , he would go to the jail , tell Langer that Bistie had left his belongings behind , get Langer to make another , more complete inventory , which would include all the billfold 's contents . But when Pete and Bistie emerged , Bistie had the sack clutched in his hand . They drove out of the jail lot , turning toward Farmington . Chee turned west , toward Shiprock . His mind worked on it as he drove . Reason told him that Bistie might not have been the shape in the darkness that had fired the shotgun into his trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back window of his pickup to shoot at Endocheeney . Or said he did . Not a shotgun . There had been no reason to search Bistie 's place for a shotgun . Maybe he did n't have one . And the complex mythology of105 *Navajo witchcraft , which Chee knew as well as any man , usually attached a motive to the malice of the skinwalkers . Bistie had no conceivable motive for wanting to kill Chee . Perhaps Bistie was not the one who had tried to kill him . But even as he thought this , he was aware that his spirit was light again . The dread had lifted . He was not afraid of Bistie , as he had been afraid of the unknown . He felt an urge to sing . The in-basket on his desk held two envelopes and one of the While You Were Out memos the tribal police used to record notes and telephone calls . One envelope , Chee noticedwith instant delight , was the pale blue of Mary Landon'sstationery . He put it in his shirt pocket and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee , Police Station , Shiprock , in clumsy letters formed with a pencil . Chee glanced at the telephone memo , which said merely : " Call Lt. Leaphorn immediately , " and tore open the envelope . The folded letter inside had been written on the pulpy lined tablet paper schoolchildren use , in the format students are taught in grade school . In the block where one is taught to put one 's return address , the writer had printed : Alice YazzieSheep Springs Trading Post Navajo Nation 92927Dear Nephew Jim Chee : I hope you are well . I am well . I write you this letter because your Uncle Frazier Denetsone is sick all this summer and worst sick about this month . We took him to the Crystal Gazer over at the Badwater Clinic and the Crystal Gazer said he should let the belagana doctor there give him some medicine . He is taking that green medicine now but he is still sick . The Crystal Gazer said he should take that medicine but that he needs a 106 *sing too . That will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing should be a Blessing Way . I heard that you did the Blessing Way sing for The Niece of Old Grandmother Nez and everybody said it was good . Everybody said you got it all right and the dry paintings were right . They said the Niece of Old Grandmother Nez got better after that . We want you to talk about it . We want you to come to the place of Hildegarde Goldtooth and we will talk to you about having the sing . We have about $400 but maybe there could be more . Chee read with intense satisfaction . The Blessing Way he had conducted last spring had been his first job as a yataalii . And his last . The niece of Old Grandmother Nez was a niece by the broad Navajo definition  --  the daughter of a first cousin on the maternal side of Chee 's family  --  and hiring him as singer had been family courtesy . In fact , the event had been a trial balloon  --  as much to inform the north centralslice of the Big Reservation that Chee had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious than the malaise of being sixteen . Now , finally , a summons had come . Alice Yazzie called him nephew , but the title here reflected good manners and not ties of either clan or family . Frazier Denetsone was probably some sort of uncle , as Navajos defined such things , through linkage with his father 's paternal clan . But a call for a yataalii did n't come from the patient . It came from whoever in the patient 's circle of family took responsibility for such things . Chee glanced at Alice Yazzie 's signature , which included , in the custom of old-fashioned Navajos , her clan . Streams Come Together Dinee . Chee was born to the Slow Talking People , and for the Salt Clan . No connections with the Streams Clan . Thus her invitation was the first clue107 *that Jim Chee was becoming accepted as a singer outside his own kinfolk . He finished the letter . Alice Yazzie wanted him to come to Hildegarde Goldtooth 's place the next Sunday evening , when she and the patient 's wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceremony . " We want to hold it as soon as we can because he is not good . He is nat going to last long , I think . " That pessimistic note diminished Chee 's jubilation . It was much better for a yataalii to begin his career with a visible cure  --  with a ceremony that not only restored the patient to harmony with his universe but also returned him to health . But Chee would tolerate nothing negative today . It would be better still to effect a cure on a hopeless case . If Frazier Denetsone 's illness was indeed subject to correction by the powers evoked by the Blessing Way ritual , if Jim Chee was good enough to perform it precisely right , then all things were possible . Chee believed in penicillin and insulin and heart bypass surgery . But he also believed that something far beyond the understanding of modern medicine controlledlife and death . He folded Alice Yazzie 's letter into his shirt pocket . With his thumbnail he opened the letter from Mary Landon . Dearest Jim : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ) . Miss you terribly . Ca n't you get some more leave and come back here for a while ? I could tell you did n't enjoy yourself on your visit in May , but now we are having our annual two weeks of what passes for summer in Wisconsin . Everything is beautiful . It has n't rained for two or three hours . You would like it now . In fact , I think you could learn to love it  --  to live somewhere away from the desert  --  if you would give it a chance . Dad and I drove down to Madison last week108 *and talked to an adviser in the College of Arts and Sciences . I will be able to get my master 's degree  --  with a little luck  --  in just two more semesters because of those two graduate courses I took when I was an undergraduate . Also found a cute efficiency apartment within walking distance of the university and picked up the application papers for graduate admission . I can start taking classes on non-degree status while they process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be any problem . Classes will start the first week of September , which means that , if I enroll , I wo n't have time to come back out to see you until semester break , which I think is about Thanksgiving . I 'm going to hate not seeing you until then , so try to find a way to come ... . Chee read the rest of it without much sense of what the words meant . Some chat about something that had happened when he 'd visited her in Stevens Point , a couple of sentences about her mother . Her father ( who had been painfullypolite and had asked Chee endless questions about the Navajo religion and had looked at him as Chee thought Chee might look at a man from another planet ) was well and thinking about retirement . She was excited about the thought of returning to school . Probably she would do it . There were more personal notes too , tender and nostalgic . He read the letter again , slowly this time . But that changed nothing . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did surprise him , oddly , he thought , was that he was n't surprised . At some subconscious level he seemed to have been expecting this . It had been inevitable since Mary had arranged the leave from the teaching job at Crownpoint . If he had n't known it then , he must have learned it during that visit to her home  --  which . 109had left him on the flight back to Albuquerque trying to analyze feelings that were a mixture of happiness and sorrow . He glanced at the opening salutation again . " Dearest Jim . . . " The notes she 'd sent him from Crownpoint had opened with " Darling ... " He stuffed the letter into his pocket with the Yazzie letter and picked up the memo . It still said : " Call Lt. Leaphorn immediately . " He called Lt. Leaphorn. .. 110 . , 12THE TELEPHONE ON Joe Leaphorn 's desk buzzed . " Who is it ? " " Jim Chee from Shiprock , " the switchboard said . " Tell him to hold it a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee , but he took a moment to reconsiderexactly how he 'd go about asking the questions . Heheld the receiver lightly in his palm , going over it . " Okay , " he said . " Put him on . " Something clicked . " This is Leaphorn , " Leaphorn said . " Jim Chee . Returning your call . " " Do you know any of the people who live out there aroundChilchinbito Canyon . Out there where Wilson Sam lived ? " " Let me think , " Chee said . Silence . " No . I do n't think so . " " You ever worked anything out there ? Enough to be familiar with the territory ? " " Not really , " Chee said . " Not my part of the reservation . " " How about the country around Badwater Wash ? Around where Endocheeney lived ? " " A lot better , " Chee said . " It 's not what Captain Largo has me patrolling , but I spent some time out there trying to find a kid who got washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I handled the Endocheeney business . Went out there twice on that . " 111 4 " I 'm right that Bistie would n't say anything about whether he knew Endocheeney ? " " Right . He would n't say anything . Except he was glad Endocheeney was dead . He made that plain . So you guess he knew the man . " You do , Leaphorn thought . But maybe you guess wrong . " Did he say anything that would give you an idea whether he knew that Badwater country ? Like about having trouble finding Endocheeney 's place ? Anything like that ? " " You mean beyond stopping at the trading post to ask directions ? He did that . " " That was in Kennedy 's report , " Leaphorn said . " What I meant was did you hear anything from him , or from the people you talked to at Badwater , that would tell you he was totally strange to that country ? Afraid of not finding the road ? Getting lost ? Anything like that ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was n't finished . Leaphorn waited . " But I did n't press it . We just got his description , and a make on his truck . Did n't look for that sort of information . " Obviously it would n't have seemed to have any meaning at that stage of the game . Perhaps it did n't now . He waited for Chee to make unnecessary excuses . None materialized . Leaphorn began phrasing his next question , but Chee interruptedthe thought . " You know , " he said slowly , " I think the fellow who knifed Endocheeney was a stranger too . Did n't know the country . " " Oh ? " Leaphorn said . He 'd heard Chee was smart . He 'd heard right . Chee was saving him his question . " He came down out of the rocks , " Chee said . " Have you seen that Endocheeney place ? It 's set back from the San Juan maybe a hundred yards . Cliffs to the south of it . The killer came down off of those . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd left his car . I spent some time looking 112 *around . There were two or three easier ways to get down to Endocheeney . Easier than the way he took . " " So , " Leaphorn said , half to himself . " Two strangers show up the same day to kill the same man . What do you think of that ? " There was silence . Through his window Leaphorn watched an unruly squadron of crows flying in from the cottonwoods along Window Rock Ridge toward the village . Lunchtime for crows in the garbage cans . But he was n't thinking of crows . He was thinking of Chee 's intelligence . If he told Chee now that the man who killed Wilson Sam was also a stranger , and how he knew it , Chee would quickly detect the reason for his first question . They had established that Chee , too , was a stranger to Wilson Sam 's landscape . They established Leaphorn 's suspicions . But to hell with that . A cop who got himself shot at from ambush should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . He would tell Chee what he 'd learned . " It 's possible , " Chee was saying , slowly , " that there were n't two strangers coming to find Endocheeney . Maybe there was just one . " " Ah , " said Leaphorn , who had the very same thought . " It could be , " Chee went on , " that Bistie knew he missed Endocheeney when he shot at him on the roof . So he drove away , parked up on the mesa , climbed down , and killed Endocheeney with the knife . And then  --  " " He confesses to shooting Endocheeney , " Leaphorn concluded . " Pretty smart . Is that what happened ? " Chee sighed . " I do n't think so , " he said . Neither did Leaphorn . It violated what he 'd learned of people down the years . People who prefer guns do n't use knives , and vice versa . Bistie had preferred a rifle . He still had the rifle . Why not use it on the second attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different tracks . I do n't think Bistie would have broughti1adalong a change of footwear , and what few tracks I found at Endocheeney 's did n't match Bistie 's boots . Anyway , why would he do that ? And why not shoot him on the second attempt ? Why use a knife ? It gave him an alibi , sure . And fooled us . But think of the advance planning it would take to make it all work out like that . And the things that could go wrong . It does n't match my impression of Bistie . " " Okay , " Leaphorn said . " Do you know anything from talking to Bistie , or from anything , that would suggest that Bistie might have known Wilson Sam ? " " No , sir . Nothing . " " Well , we seem to have another strange situation , then . " He told Chee what he 'd learned at Chilchinbito Canyon . " Does n't make much sense , " Chee said . " Does it ? " " That bone bead in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bovine . Made out of old cow bone . " Chee made a noncommittal sound . " Anything else happened with you ? Anything suspi-cious ? " " No , sir . " " You learning anything ? " " Well . . . " Chee hesitated . " Nothing much . I heard gossip at Badwater Trading Post . They say a bone was found in Endocheeney 's corpse . " Leaphorn exhaled , surprised . " Like he had been witched ? " " Yeah , " Chee said . " Or like he 'd witched somebody else and they put it back into him . " And this was , in Leaphorn 's thinking , the very worst part of a sick tradition  --  this cruel business of killing a scapegoat when things went wrong . It was what Chee Dodge had railed against when he tried to stamp it out . It was what had made Joe Leaphorn , young then and new to the Navajo Tribal Police , responsible for the deaths of four people . Two men . Two women . Three witches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gossip . He had laughed at it . He had collected the bodies  --  three murders and a suicide . That was twenty years ago . It had converted Leaphorn 's contempt for witchcraft into hatred . " Nothing about any foreign bone fragment showed up in the autopsy , " Leaphorn said . But even as he said it , he knew it was n't necessarily true . The pathologist might not list  --  probably would n't list  --  such odds and ends . When the cause of death was so obvious  --  a butcher knife blade driven repeatedlythrough clothing into the victim 's abdomen and side  --  why list the threads and buttons , lint and gum wrappers , the blade might drive through the skin ? " I thought it might be worth asking about , " Chee said . " It is , " Leaphorn said . " I will . " " Also , " Chee said . And then paused . Leaphorn waited . " Also , Bistie had a bone bead in his wallet . Just like the one I found in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaled again . " He did ? What did he say about it ? " " Well , nothing , " Chee said . He explained what had happened at the jail . " So I just put it back where I found it . " " I think we better go talk to Bistie again , " Leaphorn said . " In fact , I think we better pick him up , and lock him up until we get this sorted out a little better . " Leaphorn imagined trying to persuade Dilly to file the complaint . Dilly Streib would be hard to persuade . Dilly had been FBI too long not to care about his batting average . The Agency did n't like cases it did n't win . Still .. . Leaphorn swiveled in his chair and looked at his map . A line of bone beads now connected two of his dots . And RooseveltBistie must know how they connected . And why . " We can charge him with attempted murder , or attemptedassault , or hold him as a material witness . " " Umm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll call the feds , " Leaphorn said . He glanced at his watch . " Can you meet me in an hour at . . . " He looked at the map again , picking the most practical halfway point between Window Rock and Shiprock for their drive into the Chuskas . " At Sanostee , " he concluded . " Sanostee in an hour ? " " Yes , sir , " Chee said . " Sanostee in an hour . " 13SANOSTEE WAS HARDLY A HALFWAY point , but itwas convenient for where they were going . For Chee it was fast  --  twenty miles south on the worn pavement of U.S. 666 to Littlewater , and then nine miles westward , into the teeth of the gusting , dusty wind , up the long slope of the Chuska range to the trading post . For Leaphorn it was triple that distance  --  from Window Rock to Crystal and over WashingtonPass to Sheep Springs , then north to the Littlewater intersection . When Leaphorn reached Sanostee it was sundown , the copper-colored twilight of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging dust . Chee was sitting under his steering wheel , feet out the door , drinking an orange crush . They left Leaphorn 's car and took Chee 's . Leaphorn asked questions . Chee drove . They were astute questions , intended to duplicate as much of Chee 's memory in Leaphorn 's as was possible . At first the focus was on Bistie , on everything he 'd said and how he 'd said it , and then on Endocheeney , and finally on Janet Pete . " I had a little mixup with her last year , " Leaphorn said . " She thought we 'd roughed up a drunk  --  or said she did . " " Had we ? " Leaphorn glanced at him . " Somebody had . Unless the officer was lying about it , it was somebody else . " 117 QThe road that wandered northward from Sanostee had been graded once , and graveled at some time in the dim past when this part of the Chuskas had elected an unusually fierce advocate to the Tribal Council . The perpetual cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago and the highway superintendent for that district had solved the problem by erasing the road from his map . But it was still passable in dry weather and still used by the few families who grazed their sheep in this part of the highlands . Chee drove it carefully , skirting washouts and avoidingits washboard pattern of surface erosion when he could . Sunrays from below the curve of the planet lit cloud banks on the western horizon and reflected red now , converting the yellow hue of the universe into a vague pink tint . " I 've been wondering who called her in on this , " Chee said . " When we told Bistie he could call a lawyer , he was n't interested . " " Probably his daughter , " Leaphorn said . " Probably , " Chee agreed . He remembered the daughter standing in the yard of Bistie 's house . Would she have thought of calling a lawyer ? Driven back to Sanostee to make the call ? Known whom to call ? He amended the probably . " Maybe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rode in silence . Leaphorn sat back straight against the seat , his eyes memorizingwhat he could see of the landscape in fading yellow light , his mind drawn to the intolerable problem of Emma 's illness and then flinching away from that to escape into the merely frustrating puzzle of the four pins on his map . Chee rode slumped against the door , right hand on wheel , a taller man and slender , thinking of the bone bead in Bistie 's wallet , of what questions he might ask to cause the stubborn Bistie to talk about witchcraft to hostile strangers , of whether Leaphorn would allow him any questions , of how Leaphorn , the famous Leaphorn , the Leaphorn of tribal po- 118 *lice legends , would handle this . And thinking of Mary Landon'sletter . He found he could see the words , dark blue ink against the pale blue of the paper . " Dad and I drove down to Madison last week and talked to an adviser in the College of Arts and Sciences . I will be able to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two more semesters ... " Just two semesters . Only two semesters . Only two . Or , put another way , I will only take two long steps away from you . Or , I promised I would come back to you at the end of summer , but now I am going away . Or , rephrased again , former lover , you are now a friend . Or .. . The patrol car slanted up into the thicket of pinon and stunted ponderosa . Chee shifted into second gear . " Just over this ridge , " he said . Just over the ridge , the light became visible . It was below them , still at least half a mile away , a bright point in the darkening twilight . Chee remembered it from the afternoon they had arrested Bistie . A single bare bulb protected by a metal reflector atop a forty-foot ponderosa pine stem . Bistie'sghost light . Would a witch be worried about ghosts ? Would a witch keep a light burning to fend off the chindi which wandered in the darkness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's got electricity out here ? " Leaphorn sounded surprised . " There 's a windmill generator behind the house , " Chee said . " I guess he runs that light off batteries . " Bistie 's access route required a right turn off the road , bumped over a rocky hummock and past a scattering of piiions , to drop again down to his place . In the harsh yellow light it looked worse than Chee had remembered it  --  a rectangularplank shack , probably with two rooms , roofed with blue asphalt shingles . Behind it stood a dented metal storage 119 4shack , a brush arbor , a pole horse corral , and , up the slope by the low cliff of the mesa , a lean-to for hay storage . Beyond that , against the cliff , the yellow light reflected from a hogan made of stacked stone slabs . Beside the shack , side by side and with their vanes turned away from the gusting west wind , were Bistie 's windmill and his wind generator . Chee parked his patrol car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truck and no light on in the house . Leaphorn sighed . " You know enough about him to do any guessing about where he might be ? " he said . " Visiting kinfolksor anything ? " " No , " Chee said . " We did n't get into that . " " Lives here with his daughter . Right ? " Leaphorn said . " Right . " They waited for someone to appear at the door and acknowledge the presence of visitors , delaying the moment when they 'd admit the long drive had been for nothing . Delaying what would be either a return trip to Sanostee or a fruitless hunt for neighbors who might know where RooseveltBistie had gone . " Maybe he did n't come back here when the lawyer got him out , " Chee said . Leaphorn grunted . The yellow light from the bare bulb above them lit the right side of his face , giving it a waxy look . No one appeared at the door . Leaphorn got out of the car , slammed the door noisily behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . The door would n't be locked . Should he go in , and look around for some hint of where Bistie might be ? The wind gusted against him , blowing sand against his ankles above his socks and pushing at his uniform hat . Then it died . He heard Chee 's door opening . He smelled something burning  --  a strong , acrid odor. 120 * " Fire , " Chee said . " Somewhere . " Leaphorn trotted toward the house , rapped on the door . The smell was stronger here , seeping between door and frame . He turned the knob , pushed the door open . Smoke puffed out , and was whipped away by another gust of the dry wind . Behind him , Chee yelled : " Bistie . You in there ? " Leaphorn stepped into the smoke , fanning with his hat . Chee was just behind him . The smoke was coming from an aluminum pot on top of a butane stove against the back wall of the room . Leaphorn held his breath , turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffeepot boiling furiously beside it . He used his hat as a potholder , grabbed the handle , carried it outside , and dropped it on the packed earth . It contained what seemed to have been some sort of stew , now badly charred . Leaphorn went back inside . " No one 's here , " Chee said . He was fanning the residual smoke with his hat . A chair lay on its side on the floor . " You checked the back room ? " Chee nodded . " Nobody home . " " Left in a hurry , " Leaphorn said . He wrinkled his nose against the acrid smell of burned meat and walked back into the front yard . With the butt of his flashlight , he poked into the still-smoking pan , inspected the residue it collected . " Take a look at this , " he said to Chee . " You 're a bachelor , are n't you ? How long does it take you to burn stew like this ? " Chee inspected the pot . " The way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Depends on how much water he put in it . " " Or she , " Leaphorn said . " His daughter . When you were here with Kennedy , they just have one truck ? " " That 's all , " Chee said . " So they must be off somewhere in it , " Leaphorn said . " One or both . And they drove off the other way from the way we were coming . But if it was that way , why did n't we see 121 *their headlights ? They would have just left . " Leaphorn straightened , put his hands on his hips , stretched his back . He stared into the deepening twilight , frowning . " Just one plate on the table . You notice that ? " " Yeah , " Chee said . " And the chair turned over . " " Five or ten minutes , " Leaphorn said . " If you know how long it takes to incinerate stew , then we did n't scare him off . The truck was already gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll go in and look around again , " Chee said . " A little closer . " " Let me do it , " Leaphorn said . " See if you can find anythingout here . " Leaphorn stood at the doorway first , not wishing to furtherdisturb any signs that might have been left . He suspectedChee might be good at this , but he knew he was good . The floor was covered with dark red linoleum , seamed near the middle of the room . It was fairly new , which was good , and dusty , which was almost inevitable considering the weather , and absolutely essential considering what Leaphornhoped to do . But before he did anything , he looked . This front room was used for cooking , eating , general living , and the woman 's bedroom . One corner of the bed , a single wooden frame neatly made up , was visible behind a curtain of blankets which walled off a corner . Shelves loaded with canned goods , cooking utensils , and an assortment of boxes lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing seemed odd or out of place . The room showed the habitual neatness imposed by limited living space . But the floor was dusty . Leaphorn squatted on the step and inspected the linoleumwith his eyes just an inch or so above its surface . The pattern of dust newly disturbed by his footsteps , and Chee 's , was easy enough to make out . He could easily separate the treads of Chee 's bigger feet from his own . But the angle of 122 *light was wrong . Walking carefully , he went in and pulled the chain to turn off the light bulb . He clicked on his flashlight . Working the light carefully , squatting at first and then on his stomach with his cheek against the floor , he studied the marks left in the dust . He ignored the fresh scuffs he and Chee had made  --  looking for other marks . He found them . Dimmer but fairly fresh and plain enough to an eye as experienced at this as Leaphorn 's . Waffle marks left by the soles of someone who had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet back under the chair , leaving the drag marks of the toes . Also under the table , and near the fallen chair , another pattern , left by a rubber sole . Some sort of jogging or tennis shoes , perhaps . Smaller than the big-footed person who wore the waffle soles . Bistie and daughter ? If so , Bistie 's Daughter had large feet . Leaphorn emerged from under the table , whacking his ear in the process . Behind the curtain of blankets , on a chest beside the bed , stood two pair of shoes . Worn tan squaw boots and low-heeled black slippers . They were narrow and about size six . He took a left slipper back to the table , relocatedthe track , and made the comparison . The slipper was far too small . Bistie had been entertaining a visitor not long before Leaphorn and Chee had arrived . But where the devil had they gone ? And why had they left the stew to burn and the coffee to boil away ? He found nothing interesting in the back room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently slept was folded neatly . Bistie 's clothing hung with equal neatness from a wire strung taut along the wall  --  two pairs of wellwornjeans , a pair of khaki trousers with frayed cuffs . A plaid wool jacket , four shirts , all with long sleeves and one with a hole in the elbow . Leaphorn clicked his tongue against his teeth , thinking , studying the room . He pushed his forefinger into the enamel washbasin on the table beside 123Bistie 's bedroom , testing water temperature without thinkingwhy . It was tepid . Exactly what one would expect . He picked up the crumpled washcloth beside the basin . It was wet . Leaphorn looked at it , frowning . Not what one would expect . The cloth had been used to clean something . Leaphorn studied it in the flashlight beam . In three places the cloth was heavily smudged with dirt  --  as if to clean spots from the dusty floor . He held one of the spots to his nose and smelled it . " Chee ! " he shouted . " Chee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodicallyback and forth , looking for a wiped place and seeing none . Perhaps it had been done in the front room . He squatted , holding the flash close to the linoleum , looking for tracks . He saw , instead , a path . It was fairly regular , possiblyeighteen inches wide  --  a strip of the plastic surface wiped clean of dust . A pathway leading from the doorway into the front room , down the center of this back room , to the back door . The back door opened and Chee looked in . " I think somebody , or maybe something , got dragged out of here , " Chee said . " Drag marks leading up toward the rocks . " " Through here too , " Leaphorn said . He drew the flashlightbeam along the polished , dust-free path . " To the back door . But look at this . " He handed Chee the damp cloth . " Smell it , " he said . Chee smelled . " Blood , " Chee said . " Smells like it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stew . Fresh mutton , you think ? " " I doubt it , " Leaphorn said . " I think we ought to find where those drag marks take us . I want to know what 's being dragged . " " Or who 's being dragged , " Chee said. 124 *Bare earth that has been lived on for years and as dry as drought can make it becomes almost as hard as concrete . From the back door , Leaphorn saw nothing until Chee 's flashlight beam , held close to the earth , created shadows where something even harder had been pulled across its surface . Scratches . The scratches led past the windmill tower , past the metal storage building , and beyond . On the slope , where the earth was less pounded , the scratches becamescuff marks between the scattering of wilted weeds and clumps of grass . " Up toward the hogan , " Leaphorn said . " It leads that way . " Even in the less compacted earth the drag marks were hard to follow . The twilight had faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dark red in the west . The wind had risen again , kicking up dust in front of Leaphorn . He walked with his flashlight focused on the ground , picking up the sign of dislodged earth and crushed weeds . Even in retrospect , Leaphorn did n't remember hearing the shot  --  being aware first of pain . Something that felt like a hammer struck his right forearm and the flashlight was suddenly gone . Leaphorn was sitting on the ground , aware of Chee 's voice yelling something , aware that his forearm hurt so badly that something must have broken it . The sound of Chee 's pistol firing , the muzzle flash , brought him out of the shock and made him aware of what had happened . Roosevelt Bistie , that son-of-a-bitch , had shot him. 125 , *14THE " OFFICER DOWN " CALL provokes a special reaction in each police jurisdiction . In the Shiprock subagencyof the Navajo Tribal Police , Captain A. D. Largo commanding , it produced an immediate call to Largo himself , who was home watching television , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district , to the New Mexico State Police , and the San Juan County Sheriff 's Office . Then , since the Chuska Mountains sprawl across the New Mexico border into Arizona , and Sanostee is only a dozen or so miles from the state boundary , and neither the dispatcher at Shiprock nor anyone else was quite sure in which state all this was happening , the call also went out to the Arizona Highway Patrol and , more or less out of courtesy , to the Apache County Sheriff 's Office , which might have some legitimate jurisdictioneven though it was a hundred miles south , down at St. Johns . The Farmington office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which had ultimate jurisdiction when such a lofty crime was committed on an Indian reservation , got the word a little later via telephone . The message was relayed to Jay Kennedy at the home of a lawyer , where he was engaged in a penny-a-point rotating-partner bridge game . Kennedy had 126 *just won two consecutive rubbers and was about to make a small slam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call , finished the slam , added up the score , which showed him to be ahead 2350 points , collected his $23.50 , and left . It was a few minutes after 10 P.M.A few minutes after 10:30 , Jim Chee got back to the Bistie place . He had met the ambulance from Farmington at Littlewateron U.S. 666 . While Leaphorn was being tucked away in the back , Captain Largo had arrived  --  Gorman ridingwith him  --  and had taken charge . Largo asked a flurry of questions , sent the ambulance on its way , and made a series of quick radio checks to assure roadblocks were in place . He 'd hung up the microphone and sat , arms folded , looking at Chee . " Too late for roadblocks , probably , " he said . It had been a long day for Chee . He was tired . All the adrenaline had drained away . " Who knows , " he said . " Maybe he stopped to fix a flat . Maybe he did n't even have a car . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house . If  --  " " You think it might be somebody besides Bistie ? " " I do n't know , " Chee said . " It 's his place . He shoots at people . But then maybe somebody does n't like him any better than he likes other people , and they came and shot him and dragged him off into the rocks . " Largo 's expression , which had already been sour , suggestedhe did n't like Chee 's tone . He stared at Chee . " How did it happen ? " he asked . " One old man , sick , and two cops with guns ? " Largo obviously did n't expect an answer and Chee did n't attempt one . " You and Gorman go back up there and see if you can find him , " Largo said . " I 'll have the state police and the sheriff 's people follow you . Do n't let ' em get lost . " Chee nodded. 127 Q " I 'm meeting Kennedy here , " Largo said . " Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his car . " One more thing , " Largo shouted . " Do n't let Bistie shoot you . " And now , at 10:55 , Chee parked beside Bistie 's now-dark light pole , got out , and waited for the entourage to finish its arrival . He felt foolish . Bistie 's truck was still absent . Bistie'sshack was dark . Everything seemed to be exactly as they had left it . The chance of Bistie 's hanging around to await this posse simply did n't exist . There was a general slamming of doors . Chee explained the layout , pointed up into the darkness to the hogan from which the shots had come . They moved up the slope , weapons drawn , the state policeman carrying a riot gun , the deputy carrying a rifle . What had happened here two hours before already seemed unreal to Chee , something he had imagined . No one was at the hogan , or in it . " Here 's some brass , " the state policeman said . He was an old-timer , with red hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a copper-colored metal cylinder which reflected the beam of his flashlight . " Looks like thirty-eight caliber , " he said . " Who 'll be handling the evidence ? " " Just leave it there for Kennedy , " Chee said . " There should be another one . " He was thinking that the empty cartridge certainly was n't from a 30-30 . It was shorter . Pistolammunition . And , since it had been ejected , probably from an automatic  --  not a revolver . If Bistie had fired it , he seemed to have quite an arsenal . " Here it is , " the state policeman said . His flashlight was focused on the ground about a long step from where the first cartridge lay . " Same caliber . " Chee did n't bother to look at it . He considered asking 128 *everyone to be careful of where they walked , to avoid erasingany useful tracks . But as dry and windy as it was , he could n't imagine tracking as anything but a waste of time . Except for the drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to find . It was . " Hey , " Gorman shouted . " Here 's a body . " It was half hidden in a clump of chamiso , head downhill , feet uphill , legs still spraddled apart as if whoever had dragged it there had been using them to pull the body along and had simply dropped them . The body had been Roosevelt Bistie . In the combined lights of Chee 's and Gorman 's flashlights , the yellow look of his face was intensified  --  but death had done little to change his expression . Bistie still looked grim and bitter , as if being shot was only what he 'd expected  --  a fitting ending for a disappointing life . The dragging had pulled his shirt up over his shoulders , leaving chest and stomach bare . The waxy skin where the rib cage joined at the sternum showed two small holes , one just below the other . The lower one had bled a little . Very small holes , Chee thought . It seemed odd that such trivial holes would let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a question in his face . " This is Bistie , " Chee said . " Looks like the guy who shot Lieutenant Leaphorn had shot this guy . I guess he was dragginghim up here when we drove up , the lieutenant and me . " " And after he shot the lieutenant he just took off , " Gormansaid . " And got clean away , " Chee added . Four flashlights now were illuminating the body . Only the San Juan County deputy was still out in the darkness , doing his fruitless job . Down in Roosevelt Bistie 's yard below , two more vehicles parked . Chee heard doors slam , the voice of Kennedy , the sound of Kennedy and Captain Largo coming up the slope. 129Chee 's flashlight now was focused above the bullet wounds at a place on Bistie 's left breast  --  a reddish mark , narrow , perhaps a half-inch long , where a cut was healing . It would seem , normally , an odd place for such a cut . It made Jim Chee think of Bistie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and whether the wallet would have been dragged out of Bistie 's hip pocket on his heels-first trip up this rocky slope , and whether the bone bead would still be in it when it was found . He squatted beside Bistie , taking a closer look , imagining the scene at which this little healing scar had been produced . The hand trembler ( or stargazer , or listener , or crystalgazer , or whatever sort of shaman Bistie had chosen to diagnose his sickness ) explaining to Bistie that someone had witched him , telling Bistie that a skinwalker had blown the fatal bone fragment into him . And then the ritual cut of the skin , the sucking at the breast , the bone coming out of Bistie , appearing on the shaman 's tongue . And Bistie putting the bone in his billfold , and paying his fee , and setting out to save himself by killing the witch and reversing the dreaded corpse sickness . Chee moved the beam of his light up so that it reflected again from the glazed , angry eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Endocheeney , the man who all at Badwater agreed was a mild and harmless fellow ? The shaman would not have known that . And if the two men even knew each other , Chee had seen no sign of it . Behind him , the state policeman was shouting to Largo , telling him they 'd found a body . The wind kicked up again , blowing a flurry of sand against Chee 's face . He closed his eyes against it , and when he reopened them , a fragment of dead tumbleweed had lodged itself against Bistie 's ear . Why was Bistie so certain the witch who was killing him was Endocheeney ? He had been certain enough to try to kill the man . How had their paths crossed in this fatal way ? And 130 *where ? And when ? Now that Bistie was also dead , who could answer those questions ? Any of them ? Largo had joined the circle now , and Kennedy . Chee sensed them standing just behind him , staring down at the body . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two gunshots through the chest . " Just on the edge of the circle of illumination , Chee could see the healing cut on Bistie 's breast . Those two bullets had completed the death of Roosevelt Bistie . But the little wound high on his breast above them had been where Roosevelt Bistie 's death had started. 15THE INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE HOSPITAL at Gallupis one of the prides of this huge federal bureaucracy  --  modern , attractive , well located and equipped . It had been built in a period of flush budgeting  --  with just about everything any hospital needs . Now , in a lean budget cycle , it was enduringharder times . But the shortage of nurses , the overspentsupplies budget , and the assortment of other fiscal headaches that beset the hospital 's bead counters this particularmorning did not affect Joe Leaphorn 's lunch , which was everything a sensible patient should expect from a hospitalkitchen , nor the view from his window , which was superb . The Health Service had located the hospital high on the slope overlooking Gallup from the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , Leaphorn could see the endless stream of semitrailers moving along Interstate 40 . Beyond the highway , intercontinental train traffic rolled east and west on the Santa Fe main trunk . Above and beyond the railroad , beyond the clutter of east Gallup , the red cliffs of Mesa de los Lobos rose  --  their redness diminished a little by the blue haze of distance , and above them was the gray-green shape of the high country of the Navajo borderlands , where the Big Reservation faded into Checkboafd Reservation . For Joe Leaphorn , raised not fifty miles north 132 *of this bed in the grass country near Two Gray Hills , it was the landscape of his childhood . But now he looked at the scene without thinking about it . He had been awake only a minute or two , having been jarred by the arrival of his lunch tray from a hazy , morphine-induceddoze into a panicky concern for the welfare of Emma . He remembered very quickly that Agnes was there , had been there for days , living in the spare bedroom and playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous , but she had good sense . She 'd take care of Emma , make the right decisions . He need n't worry . No more than he normally did . Now he had finished the wit-collection process that followssuch awakenings . He had established where he was , remembered why , quickly assessed the unfamiliar surroundings , checked the heavy , still cool and damp cast on his right arm , moved his thumb experimentally , then his fingers , then his hand , to measure the pain caused by each motion , and then he thought about Emma again . Her appointment was tomorrow . He would be well enough to take her , no question of that . And another step would be taken toward knowing what he already knew . What he dreaded to admit . The rest of his life would be spent watching her slip away from him , not knowing who he was , then not knowing who she was . In the material the Alzheimer 's Association had sent him , someone had described it as " looking into your mind and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered the case report of the husband of a victim . " Every day I would tell her we 'd been married 30 years , that we had four children . . . . Every night when I got into bed she would say , Who are you ? ' " He had alreadyseen the first of that . Last week , he had walked into the kitchen and Emma had looked up from the carrots she was scraping . Her expression had been first startled , then fearful , then confused . And she had clutched Agnes 's arm133 *and asked who he was . That was something he 'd have to learn to live with  --  like learning to live with a dagger through the heart . He groped clumsily with his good left hand for the button to summon an attendant , found it , pressed it , glanced at his watch . Outside the glass , the light was blinding . Far to the east , a cloud was building over Tsoodzil , the Turquoise Mountain . Rain ? Too early to tell , and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop into a thunderstorm . He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and sat , slumped , waiting for the dizziness to subside , feeling an odd , buzzing sense of detachment induced by whatever they 'd given him to make him sleep . " Well , " a voice behind him said . " I did n't expect to find you out of bed . " It was Dilly Streib . He was wearing his FBI summer uniform , a dark blue two-piece suit , white shirt , and necktie . On Streib , all of this managed to look slept in . " I 'm not out of bed yet , " Leaphorn said . He gestured toward the closet door . " Look around in there and see if you can find my clothes . Then I 'll be out of bed . " Streib was holding a manila folder in his left hand . He dropped it on the foot of Leaphorn 's bed and disappeared into the closet . " Thought you 'd like to take a look at that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to Leaphorn that he had a headache . He took a deep breath . His lunch seemed to consist of a bowl of soup , which was steaming , a small green salad , and something including chicken which normally would have looked appetizing . But now Leaphorn 's stomach felt as if it had been tilted on its side . " I know what happened , " Leaphorn said . " Somebody shot me in the arm . " " I meant after that , " Streib said . He dumped Leaphorn 's uniform on the foot of his bed and his boots on the floor . ' " After that I 'm blank , " Leaphorn said. 134 * " Well , to get to the bottom line , the guy got away and he left behind Bistie 's body . " " Bistie 's body ? " Leaphorn reached for the folder , digestingthis . " Shot , " Streib said . " Twice . With a pistol , probably . Probablya thirty-eight or so . " Leaphorn extracted the report from the folder . Two sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy . He handed the report back to Streib . " What do you think ? " Streib asked . Leaphorn shook his head . " I think it 's getting interesting , " Streib said . That meant , Leaphorn understood from half a lifetime spent working with the federals , that people with clout and high civil servicenumbers were beginning to think they had more bodies than could be politely buried . He took off his hospital gown , picked up his undershirt , and considered the problem of how to get it on without moving his right arm around more than was necessary . " I think we should have kept that Indian locked up awhile , " Streib said . He chuckled . " I guess that 's belaboring the obvious . " The chuckle turned into a laugh . " I 'm sure his doctor would have recommended it . " " You think we could have got him to change his mind ? Tell us what he had against Endocheeney ? " Leaphorn asked . He thought a moment . If they had taken Bistie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , old trick . The traditional culture allows a lie , if it does no harm , but the lie can be repeated only three times . The fourth time told , it locks the teller into the deceit . He could n't have worked it on Bistie directly , because Bistie would have simplycontinued to refuse to say anything about Endocheeney , or bone beads , or witchcraft . But maybe he could have worked around the edges . Maybe . Maybe not . " I 'm not so sure , " Leaphorn said . He was even less sure 135he could have talked Streib into signing his name on the sort of complaint they would have needed . This was a notably untidy piece of work , this business of a man who seemed to think he 'd shot a man who 'd actually been stabbed . And the FBI had n't fooled the taxpayers all these years by getting itself involved with the messy ones . Streib was a good man , but he had n't survived twenty years in the Agency jungle without learning the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I defer to you redskins on that . But anyhow . . . " He shrugged , letting it trail off . " This is going to put the heat on . Now we do n't just have a bunch of singles . Now we got ourselves a double . And maybe more than a double . You know how that works . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . Doubling homicides did n't double the interest  --  it was more like squaring it . And if you had yourself genuine serial killings , nicely mysterious , the interestand the pressure and the potential for publicity went right through the roof . Publicity had never been an issue with Navajo Tribal Police  --  they simply never got any  --  but for federals , good press brought the billions pouring in and kept the J. Edgar Hoover Building swarming with fat-cat bureaucrats . But it had damned sure better be good press . Streib had seated himself . He looked at the report and then at Leaphorn , who was pulling on his pants with lefthandedawkwardness . Streib 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to look worried . Now he managed . " Trouble is , among the many troubles , I ca n't see how the hell to get a handle on this . Does n't seem to have a handle . " Leaphorn was learning how difficult it can be fasten the top button of his uniform trousers with his left-hand fingers after a lifetime of doing it with right-hand fingers . And he was remembering the question Jim Chee had raised . ( " I heard gossip at Badwater Trading Post , " Chee had said . " They say a bone was found in Endocheeney 's corpse . " ) Had the pathologist found the bone ? 136 * " The autopsy on Old Man Endocheeney up at Farmington , " Leaphorn said . " I think somebody should talk to the pathologist about that . Find out every little thing they found in that stab wound . " Streib put the report back in the folder , the folder on his lap , pulled out his pipe , and looked at the No Smoking sign beside the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poster that read : " Little Orphan Annie 's Parents Smoked . " Beside that poster was another , a photograph of rows and rows of tombstones , with a legend reading " MarlboroCountry . " Streib sniffed at the pipe , put it back in his jacket pocket . " Why ? " he asked . " One of our people heard rumors that a little fragment of bone was found in the wound , " Leaphorn said . He kept his eyes on Streib . Would that be enough explanation ? Streib 's expression said it was n't . " Jim Chee found a little bone bead in his house trailer along with the lead pellets after somebody shot the shotgun through his wall , " Leaphorn said . " And Roosevelt Bistie was carrying a little bone bead in his wallet . " Understanding dawned slowly , and unhappily , causing Streib 's round face to convert itself from its unaccustomed expression of worry to an equally unaccustomed look of sorrowand dismay . " Bone , " he said . " As in skinwalking . As in witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaphorn said . " Lordy , lordy , lordy , " Streib said . " What the hell next ? I hate it . " " But maybe it 's a handle . " " Handle , shit , " Streib said , with a passion that was rare for him . " You remember way back when that cop got ambushedover on the Laguna-Acoma . You remember that one . The agent on that one said something about witchcraft137 *when he was working it , put it in his report . I think they called him all the way back to Washington so the very top dogs could chew him out in person . That was after doing it by letters and telegrams . " " But it was witchcraft , " Leaphorn said . " Or it was n't , of course , but the Lagunas they tried for it said they killed the cop because he had been witching them , and the judge ruled insanity , and they  --  " " They went into a mental hospital , and the agent got transferred from Albuquerque to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice rich with passion . " The judge ruled ' do n't cut it in Washington . In Washington they do n't believe in agents who believe in witches . " " I 'd do it myself . Look into it , I mean . But I think you 'd have more luck talking to the doctor , " Leaphorn said . " Gettingtaken seriously . I go in there , a Navajo , and start talking to the doc about witch bones and corpse sickness and  --  " " I know . I know , " Streib said . He looked at Leaphorn quizzically . " A bone bead , you said ? Human ? " " Cow . " " Cow ? Anything special about cow bones ? " " Damn it , " Leaphorn said . " Cow or giraffe , or dinosaur or whatever . What difference does it make ? Just so whoever we 're dealing with thinks it works . " " Okay , " Streib said . " I 'll ask . You got any other ideas ? I got a sort of a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  could be some sort of sex-and-jealousy thing . Or maybe the Onesalt gal nosed into some sort of ripoff in the tribal paperwork that caused undue resentment . We know she was a sort of full-time world-saver . Usuallyyou just put her type down as a pain in the ass , but maybe she was irritating the wrong fellow . But I sort of see her as one case and those others as another bag . And maybe now we toss that Chee business in with ' em . You have any fresh thinking about it ? " 138 *Leaphorn shook his head . " Just the bone angle , " he said . " And probably that leads no place . " But he was doing some fresh thinking . Nothing he wanted to talk to Streib about . Not yet . He wanted to find out if Onesalt 's agency knew anything about the letter that office had mailed to Dugai Endocheeney . If Onesalt had written it , Dilly might be dead wrong about Onesalt not being linked to the other homicides . And now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . Bistie had been part of it , part of whatever it was that was killing people on the Big Reservation . Thus the killing of Bistie was something new . Whateverit was , this lethal being , now it seemed to be feeding on itself. 139 ' tTHE CAT WAS THERE when Chee awakened . It was sitting just inside the door , looking out through the screen . When he stirred , rising onto his side in the awkward process of getting up from the pallet he 'd made on the floor , the cat had been instantly alert , watching him tensely . He sat , completed a huge yawn , rubbed the sleep from his eyes , and then stood , stretching . To his mild surprise , the cat was still there when he finished that . Its green eyes were fixed on him nervously , but it had n't fled . Chee rolled up the sleeping bag he 'd been using as a pad , tied it , dumped it on his unused bunk . He inspected the irregular row of holes the shotgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he knew who had done it , when he knew it would n't be happening again , he would find himself a tinsmith  --  orwhomever one found to patch shotgun holes in aluminum alloy walls  --  and get them patched more permanently . He peeled off the duct tape he 'd used to cover them and held out his hand , feeling the breeze sucking in . Until the rains came , or winter , he might as well benefit from the improved ventilation . For breakfast he finished a can of peaches he 'd left in the refrigerator and the remains of a loaf of bread . It was n't exactly breakfast , anyway . He 'd got to bed just at dawn140 4thinking he was too tired , and too wired , to sleep . Even though night was almost gone , he avoided the bunk and used the floor . He had lain there remembering the two black holes in the skin of Roosevelt Bistie 's chest , remembering the healing cut higher on Bistie 's breast . Those vivid images faded away into a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying , it had not been Roosevelt Bistie 's daughter . The daughter had driven up just behind the ambulance . She had been following it , in fact  --  coming home from Shiprock with four boxes of groceries . She had emerged from Bistie 's old truck into the pale yellow light of police lanterns , with her face frozen in that expression every cop learns to dread  --  the face of a woman who is expecting the very worst and has steeled herself to accept it with dignity . She had looked down at the body as they carried it past her and slid the stretcher into the ambulance . Then she had looked up at Captain Largo . " I knew it would be him , " she 'd said , in a voice that sounded remarkably matter-of-fact . Chee had watched her , examining her grief for some sign of pretense and thinking that her prescience was hardly remarkable . For whom else could the ambulance have been making this back-road trip ? Virtually no one else lived on this particular slope of this particular mountain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of track . The emotion of Bistie 's Daughter seemed totally genuine  --  more shock than sorrow . No tears . If they came , they would come later , when her yard was cleared of all these strangers , and dignityno longer mattered , and the loneliness closed in around her . Now she talked calmly with Captain Largo and with Kennedy  --  responding to their questions in a voice too low for Chee to overhear , as expressionless as if her face had been carved from wood . But she had recognized Chee immediately when all that 141 *was done . The ambulance had driven away , taking with it the flesh and bones that had held the living wind of RooseveltBistie and leaving behind , somewhere in the night air around them , his chindi . " Did Captain Largo tell you where he died ? " Chee had asked her . He spoke in Navajo , using the long , ugly guttural sound which signifies that moment when the wind of life no longer moves inside a human personality , and all the disharmoniesthat have bedeviled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where ? " she asked , at first puzzled by the question . Then she understood it , and looked at the house . " Was it inside ? " " Outside , " Chee said . " Out in the yard . Behind the house . " It might be true . It takes a while for a man to die  --  even shot twice through the chest . No reason for Bistie 's Daughterto believe her house had been contaminated with her father 's ghost . Chee had evolved his own theology about ghost sickness and the chindi that caused it . It was , like all the evils that threatened the happiness of humankind , a matter of the mind . The psychology courses he 'd taken at the University of New Mexico had always seemed to Chee a logical extension of what the Holy People had taught those original four Navajo clans . And now he noticed some slight relaxation in the face of Bistie 's Daughter  --  some relief . It was better not to have to deal with ghosts . She was looking at Chee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belagana came to get him that he was angry , " she said . " Did you notice that ? " " But I do n't know why , " Chee said . " Why was he so angry ? " " Because he knew he had to die . He went to the hospital . They told him about his liver . " She placed a hand against her stomach. 142 Q " What was it ? Was it cancer ? " Bistie 's Daughter shrugged . " They call it cancer , " she said . " We call it corpse sickness . Whatever word you put on it , it was killing him . " " It could n't be cured ? Did they tell him that ? " Bistie 's Daughter glanced around her , looked nervously past Chee into the night . The state policeman 's car  --  on its way back to paved highways  --  crunched through the weeds at the edge of the yard . Its headlights flashed across her face . She raised her hand against the glare . " You can turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard you could do that . " " You mean kill the witch and put the bone back in him ? " Chee said . " Is that what he was going to do ? " Bistie 's Daughter looked at him silently . " I talked to them already , " she said finally . " To the other policemen . To the young belagana and the fat Navajo . " Largo would hate hearing that " fat Navajo " description , Chee thought . " Did you tell them that 's what your father was doing ? When he went to the Endocheeney place ? " " I told them I did n't know what he was doing . I did n't know that man who got killed . All I know is that my father was getting sicker and sicker all the time . He went to see a hand trembler over there between Roof Butte and Lukachukaito find out what kind of cure he would need to have . But the hand trembler had gone off someplace and he was n't home . He went over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter House , and talked to a listener over there . He told him he had been cooking food over a fire made out of wood struck by lightning and he needed to have a Hail Chant . " Bistie 's Daughter looked up at Chee with a strained grin . " We burn butane to cook on , " she said . " But he charged my father fifty dollars . Then he went to the Badwater Clinic to see if they would give him some medicine . He did n't come back until the next day because they kept him in the hospital . Made X-rays , I143think . Things like that . When he came back he was angry . Said they told him he was going to die . " Bistie 's Daughter stopped talking then , and looked away from Chee . Tears came abruptly but without sound . " Why angry ? " Chee asked , his voice so low she might have thought he meant the question only for himself . " Because they told him he could not be cured , " Bistie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat , wiped the back of her hand across her eyes . " That man was strong , " she continued . " His spirit was strong . He did n't give up on things . He did n't want to die . " " Did he say why he was angry at Endocheeney ? Why he blamed Endocheeney ? Did he say he thought Endocheeney had witched him ? " " He did n't say hardly anything at all . I asked him . I said , My Father , why  --  ' " She stopped . Never speak the name of the dead , Chee thought . Never summon the chindi to you , even if the name of the ghost is Father . " I asked that man why he was angry . What was wrong . What had they told him at the Badwater Clinic ? And finally he told me they said his liver was rotten and they did n't know how to fix it with medicine and he was going to die pretty quick . I told the other policemen all this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bistie 's Daughter shook her head . " I noticed that he had a cut place on his breast . " Chee tapped his uniform shirt , indicating where . " It was healing but still a little sore . Do you know about that ? " " No , " she said . The answer did n't surprise Chee . His people had adopted many ways of the belagana , but most of them had retained the Dinee tradition of personal modesty . Roosevelt Bistie would have kept his shirt on in the presence of his daughter . " Did he ever say anything about Endocheeney ? " 144 * " No . " " Was Endocheeney a friend ? " " I do n't think so . I never heard of him before . " Chee clicked his tongue . Another door closed . " I guess the policemen asked you if you know who came here to see your fath . . . to see him tonight ? " " I did n't know he was home . I was away since yesterday . In Gallup to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he was back from being in jail . " " After we arrested him , did you go and get the lawyer to get him out ? " Bistie 's Daughter looked puzzled . " I do n't know anything about that , " she said . " You did n't call a lawyer ? Did you ask anyone else to call one ? " " I do n't know anything about lawyers . I just heard that lawyers will get all your money . " " Do you know a woman named Janet Pete ? " Bistie 's Daughter shook her head . " Do you have any idea who it might have been who came here and shot him ? Any idea at all ? " Bistie 's Daughter was no longer crying , but she wiped her hand across her eyes again , looked down , and released a long , shuddering sigh . " I think he was trying to kill a skinwalker , " she said . " The skinwalker came and killed him . " And now , as Jim Chee finished the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the can with the bread crust , he remembered exactly how Bistie 's Daughter had looked as she 'd said that . He thought she was probably exactlycorrect . The Mystery of Roosevelt Bistie neatly solved in a sentence . All that remained was another question . Who was the skinwalker who came and shot Bistie ? Behind that , how did the witch know Bistie would be home instead of safely jailed in Farmington ? 145In other words , who called Janet Pete ? He would find out . Right now . The very next step . As soon as he finished breakfast . He unplugged his coffeepot , filled his coffee cup with water , swirled it gently , and drank it down . ( " I never saw anybody do that before , " Mary Landon had said . " What ? " " That with the water you rinsed your cup with . " Emptyhanded , she had mimicked the swirling and the drinking . It still had taken him a moment to understand . " Oh , " he had said . " If you grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour it out . You do n't waste it , even if it tastes a little bit like coffee . " " Odd , " Mary Landon said . " What the old prof in Sociology101 would call a cultural anomaly . " It had seemed odd to Chee that not wasting water had seemed odd to Mary Landon . It still seemed odd . ) He put the pot under the sink . " Look out , Cat , " he said . And the cat , instead of diving for the exit flap as it normally did when he came anywhere near this close , moved down the trailer . It sat under his bunk , looking at him nervously . It took a millisecond for Jim Chee to register the meaning of this . Something out there . He sucked in his breath , reached for his belt , extracted his pistol . He could see nothing out the door except his pickup and the empty slope . He checked out of each of the windows . Nothing moved . He went through the door in a crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped in the cover of the pickup . Absolutely nothing moved . Chee felt the tension seep away . But something had driven in the cat . He walked to its den , eyes on the ground . In the softer earth around the148juniper there were paw prints . A dog ? Chee squatted , studyingthem . Coyote tracks . Back in the trailer , the cat was sitting on his bedroll . They looked at each other . Chee noticed something new . The cat was pregnant . " Coyote 's after you , I guess , " Chee said . " That right ? " The cat looked at him . " Dry weather , " Chee said . " No rain . Water holes dry up . Prairie dogs , kangaroo rats , all that , they die off . Coyotes come to town and eat cats . " The cat got up from the bedroll , edged toward the doorway . Chee got a better look at it . Not very pregnant yet . That would come later . It looked gaunt and had a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something up for you , " Chee said . But what ? Fixing something that would be proof against a hungrycoyote would take some thought . Meanwhile he looked through the refrigerator . Orange juice , two cans of Dr Pepper , limp celery , two jars of jelly , a half-consumed box of Velveeta : nothing palatable for a cat . On the shelf above the stove , he found a can of pork and beans , opened it , and left it on a copy of the Farmington Times beside the screen door . When he got back from finding out who called Janet Pete , he 'd think of something to do about the coyote . He backed his pickup away from the trailer . In the rearview mirror he noticed that the cat was gulping down the beans . Maybe Janet Pete would have an idea about the cat . Sometimes women were smarter about such things . But Janet Pete was not at the Shiprock DNA office , a circumstance that seemed to give some satisfaction to the young man in the white shirt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you expect her ? " Chee asked . " Who knows ? " the young man said . " This afternoon ? Or has she left town or something ? " 147 * " Maybe , " the man said . He shrugged . " I 'll leave her a message , " Chee said . He took out his notebook and his pen and wrote : " Ms. Pete  --  I need to know who called you to come and get Roosevelt Bistie out of jail . Important . If I 'm not in , please leave message . " He signed it and left the tribal police telephone number . But on the way out , he saw Janet Pete pulling into the parking area . She was driving a white Chevy , newly washed , with the Navajo Nation 's seal newly painted on its door . She watched him walk up , her face neutral . " Ya-tah-hey , " Chee said . Janet Pete nodded . " If you have just a minute or two , I need to talk to you , " Chee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter told me she did n't call a lawyer for her father . I need to know who called you . " And I need to know absolutely everything else you know about Roosevelt Bistie , Chee thought , but first things first . Janet Pete 's expression had shifted from approximately neutral to slightly hostile . " It does n't matter who called , " she said . " We do n't have to have a request for representation from the next of kin . It can be anybody . " She opened the car door and swung her legs out . " Or it can be nobody , for that matter . If someone needs to have his legal rights protected , we do n't have to be asked . " Janet Pete was wearing a pale blue blouse and a tweed skirt . The legs she swung out of the car were very nice legs . And Miss Pete noticed that Chee had noticed . " I need to know who it was , " Chee said . He was surprised . He had n't expected any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why be  --  " " You have another homicide to work on now , " she said. f IAA 4 " Why not just leave Mr. Bistie alone . He did n't kill anyone . And he 's sick . You should be able to see that . I think he has cancer of the liver . Another homicide . And no arrest made . Why do n't you work on that ? " Janet Pete was leaning on the car door while she said this , and smiling slightly . But it was n't a friendly smile . " Where did you hear about the homicide ? " She tapped the car . " Radio , " she said . " Noon news , KGAK , Gallup , New Mexico . " " They did n't say who was shot ? " " Police did not reveal the identity of the victim , ' " she said , but the smile faded as she said it . " Who was it ? " " It was Roosevelt Bistie , " Chee said . " Oh , no , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrinkled her face , closed her eyes , shook her head against this mortality . " That poor man . " She put her hands across her face . " That poor man . " " Somebody came to his house last night . His daughter was gone . They shot him . " Janet Pete lowered her hands to listen to this , staring at Chee . " Why ? Do you know why ? He was dying , anyway . He said the doctor told him the cancer would kill him . " " We do n't know why , " Chee said . " I want to talk to you about it . We 're trying to find out why . " They left Janet Pete 's clean Chevy and got into Chee 's unwashed patrol car . At the Turquoise Coffee Shop , Janet Pete ordered iced tea and Chee had coffee . " You want to know who called me . That 's funny , because the man who called lied . I found out later . He said his name was Curtis Atcitty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for me . " " Did he say who he was ? " " He said he was a friend of Roosevelt Bistie , and he said Bistie was being held without bond and without any charges being filed against him , and that he was sick and did n't have149any lawyer and he needed help . " She paused , thinking about it . " And he said that Bistie had asked him to call DNA about a lawyer . " She looked at Chee . " That 's where he lied . When I told Bistie about it , he said he had n't asked anybody to call . He said he did n't know anybody named Curtis Atcitty . " Chee clicked his tongue against his teeth , the sound of disappointment . So much for that . " When you left the jail , I saw you driving back into Farmington . Where did you go ? When was the last time you saw him ? " " Down to the bus station . He thought one of his relatives might be there , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was there , so I took him back to Shiprock . He saw a truck he recognized at the Economy Washomat and I left him out there . " " Did he ever tell you why he tried to kill Old Man Endo-cheeney ? " Janet Pete simply looked at him . " He 's dead , " Chee said . " No lawyer-client confidentiality left . Now it 's try to find out who killed him . " Janet Pete studied her hands , which were small and narrow , with long , slender fingers , and if her fingernails were polished it was with the transparent , colorless stuff . Nice feminine hands , Chee thought . He remembered Mary Landon'shands , strong , smooth fingers intertwined with his own . Mary Landon 's fingertips . Mary Landon 's small white fist engulfed in his own . Janet Pete 's right hand now gripped her left . " I 'm not stalling , " she said . " I 'm thinking . I 'm trying to remember . " Chee wanted to tell her it was important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that to this lawyer . He watched her hands , thinking of Mary Landon , and then her face , thinking of Janet Pete . " He said very little altogether , " she said . " He did n't talk 150 *much . He wanted to know if he could go home . We talked about that . I asked him if he knew exactly what he was accused of doing . What law he was supposed to have broken . " She glanced at Chee , then turned her eyes away , gazingout the street window through the dusty glass on which THE TURQUOISE CAFE was lettered in reverse . Beyond the glass , the dry wind was chasing a tumbleweed down the street . " He said he had shot a fellow over in the San Juan Canyon . And then he sort of chuckled and said maybe he just scared him . But anyway the man was dead and that was what you had him in jail for . " She frowned , concentrating , right hand gripping the left . " I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something vague . " She shook her head . " Vague ? " " I do n't remember . Something like I had a reason , ' or good reason , ' or something like that  --  without saying why . " " Did you press him at all ? " " I said something like You must have had a good reason to shoot at a man , ' and he laughed , I remember that , but not like he thought it was funny , and I asked him directly what his reason was and he just shut up and would n't answer . " " He would n't tell us anything , either , " Chee said . Janet Pete had taken a sip from her glass . Now she held it a few inches from her lips . " I told him I was his lawyer  --  there to help him . What he told me would be kept secret from anyone else . I told him shooting at somebody , even if you missed them , could get him in serious trouble with the white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would be smart to let me know about it . To see if we could use it in some way to help keep him out of jail . " She put down the glass and looked directly at Chee . " That 's when he told me about being sick . It was easy enough to see anyway , with the way he looked . But anyway , he said the white man could n't give him any more trouble ) 151Qthan he already had , because he had cancer in his liver . " She used the Navajo phrase for it  --  " the sore that never heals . " " That 's what his daughter told me , " Chee said . " Cancer of the liver . " Janet Pete was studying Chee 's face . It was a habit that Chee had learned slowly , and come to tolerate slowly , and that still sometimes made him uneasy . Another of those cultural differences that Mary found odd and exotic . ( " That first month or two in class I was always saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the kids simply would n't do it . They would always look at their hands , or the blackboard , or anywhere except looking me in the face . And finally one of the other teachers told me it was a cultural thing . They should warn us about things like that . Odd things . It makes the children seem evasive , deceptive . " And Chee had said something about it not seeming odd or evasive to him . It seemed merely polite . Only the rude peered into one 's face during a conversation . And Mary Landonhad asked him how this worked for a policeman . Surely , she 'd said , they must be trained to look for all those signalsfacial expressions reveal while the speaker is lying , or evad- j ing , or telling less than the truth . And he had said ... ) " You needed to know who called me , " Janet Pete was saying , " because you suspect that whoever called is the one who killed Roosevelt Bistie . Is n't that it ? " Like police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different conversational technique than Navajomothers . The white way . The way of looking for what the handbook on interrogation called " nonverbal signals . " Chee found himself trying to keep his face blank , to send no such signals . " That 's possible , " he said . " It may have happenedthat way . " " In fact , " Janet Pete said , slowly and thoughtfully , " you think this man used me . Used me to get Mr. Bistie out of jail and home . . . . " Her voice trailed off . Chee had been looking out past the window 's painted lettering . The wind had changed direction just a little  --  enough to pull loose the leaves and twigs and bits of paper it had pinned against the sheep fence across the highway . Now the gusts were pulling these away , sending them skittering along the pavement . Changing winds meant changing weather . Maybe , finally , it would rain . But the new tone in Janet Pete 's voice drew his attention back to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . " She looked at Chee for confirmation . " He would have gotten out , anyway , " Chee said . " The FBI had him , and the FBI did n't charge him with anything . We could n't have  --  " " But I think that man wanted Mr. Bistie out before he would talk to anyone . Does n't that make sense ? " It was exactly the thought that had brought him looking for Janet Pete . " Doubtful , " Chee said . " Probably no connection at all . " Janet Pete was reading his nonverbal signals . Rude , Chee thought . No wonder Navajos rated it as bad manners . It invaded the individual 's privacy . " It 's not doubtful at all , " she said . " You are lying to me now . " But she smiled . " That 's kind of you . But I ca n't help but feel responsible . " She looked very glum . " I am responsible . Somebody wants to kill my client , so they call me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She picked up her glass , noticed it was empty , put it down again . " He did n't even particularly want to be my client . The guy who wanted to shut him up just put me on the job . " " It probably was n't that way , " Chee said . " Different people , probably . Some friend called you , not knowing that this madman was coming along . " " I 'm getting to be a jinx , " Janet Pete said . " Typhoid Mary . A sort of curse . " Chee waited for the explanation . Janet Pete offered none . She sat , her square shoulders slumped a little , and looked sadly at her hands . " Why jinx ? " Chee said . " This is the second time this happened , " Janet Pete said , without looking at Chee . " Last time it was Irma . Irma One-salt . " " The woman who got killed over by ... You knew her ? " " Not very well , " Janet said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I want to hear about it , " Chee said . Leaphorn seemed to think there might be some connection between the Onesalt killing and the Sam and Endocheeney cases . The lieutenant had been very interested when Chee had told him about the letter , Endocheeney received from Onesalt 's office . It did n't seem likely , but maybe there was some sort of link . " That 's how I heard about Officer Jim Chee , " Janet Pete said , studying him . " Irma Onesalt said you did her a favor , but she did n't like you . " " I do n't understand , " Chee said . And he did n't . He felt foolish . The only time he 'd met Onesalt , the only time he could remember , had been that business about picking up the patient at the clinic  --  the wrong Begay business . " She told me you were supposed to deliver a witness to a chapter meeting and you showed up with the wrong man and screwed everything all up . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a favor . " " What ? " " She did n't say . I think it must have been some sort of accident . I remember she said you helped her out and you did n't even know it . " " I sure did n't , " Chee said . " And do n't . " He waved at the man behind the counter , signaling a need for refills . " How was she your client ? " " That 's pretty vague too , " Janet Pete said . " She called one day and made an appointment . And when she came by , 154 *she mostly just asked a lot of questions . " She paused while her glass was refilled and then stirred sugar into her tea  --  two teaspoons . How did she keep so slim ? Chee wondered . Nervous , he guessed . Runs it off . Mary was like that . Always moving . " I do n't think she trusted me . Asked a lot of questions about our relationship at DNA with the tribal bureaucracy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way , she had a lot of questions about what I could find out for her . Financial records , things like that . What was public . What was n't . How to get documents . I asked her what she was working on , and she said she would tell me later . That maybe it was n't much of anything and then she would n't bother me . Otherwise , she would call me back . " " Did she ? " " Somebody shot her , " Janet Pete said . " About ten days later . " " Did you report talking to her ? " " Probably no connection , but finally I did . I checked to find out who was handling the case and then called him and told him  --  Streib I think it was . " She shrugged . " The fed at Gallup . " " Dilly Streib , " Chee said . " What did he say ? " She made a wry face . " You know the FBI , " she said . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was after ? " " Not really . " She sipped the tea , slim fingers around the tall glass . A Navajo complexion , Chee thought . Perfect skin . Smooth , glossy . Janet Pete would never have a freckle . Janet Pete would n't have a wrinkle until she was old . " But she said something that I remembered . It made me curious . Let 's see if I can remember just how she put it . " She raised a slim hand to her cheek , thinking . " I asked what she would want to look for and she said maybe some answers to155 *some questions , and I said what questions and she said ... she said how people can look so healthy after they 're dead . And then I asked her what that meant . Did n't really ask her exactly , you know . Just looked puzzled , raised my eyebrows or something like that . And she just laughed . " " How people can look healthy after they 're dead ? " " That 's it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was the sense of it . Mean anything to you ? " " Absolutely nothing , " Chee said , thinking about it so hard that he forgot the refill , and gulped scalding coffee , and spilled it on his uniform shirt  --  which was not at all what Jim Chee wanted to do in front of Janet Pete. 15617THE FIRST THING Joe Leaphorn noticed when he rolled Emma 's old Chevy sedan to a halt in the yard of the Short Mountain Trading Post was that McGinnis had re- painted his Sale sign . The sign had been there the first time Leaphorn had seen the place , coming on some long-forgotten assignment when he was a green new patrolman working in the Tuba City subagency . He sat assessing the pain in his forearm . And remembering . Even then the sign had been weather-beaten . Then , as now , it proclaimed in large block letters : THIS ESTABLISHMENTFOR SALEINQUIRE WITHINAround Short Mountain , they said that the store on the rim of Short Mountain Wash had been established some- time before the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noticed the lack of competition without noticing the lack of customers . It was also said that he had been con- vinced that the oil prosperity he saw far to the north around Aneth and Montezuma Creek would spread inexorably and inevitably south and west  --  that the Just Creator must have blessed this area somehow with something . And since the 157 *surface itself offered nothing but scanty grass , scarce wood , and a wilderness of erosion , there surely must be a bountiful treasure of oil below those sterile rocks . But his optimism had finally faltered with the Aneth field , and when his church ruled against multiple wives , he 'd opted to join the polygamist faction in its trek to tolerant Mexico . Everyonearound Short Mountain Wash seemed to remember the legend . No one remembered the man himself , but those who knew McGinnis marveled at the Mormon 's salesmanship . McGinnis now appeared in his doorway , talking to a departingcustomer , a tall Navajo woman with a sack of cornmealdraped over her shoulder . While he talked he stared at Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger was driving it . Among the scattered people who occupied the emptiness of Short Mountain country , strangersprovoked intense curiosity . In Old Man McGinnis , almostanything provoked intense curiosity . Which was one reason Leaphorn wanted to talk to Old Man McGinnis , and had been talking to him for more than twenty years , and had become in some odd way his friend . The other reason was more complicated . It had something to do with the fact that McGinnis , alone , without wife , friend , or family , endured . Leaphorn appreciated those who endured . But Leaphorn was in no hurry . First he would give his arm a chance to quit throbbing . " Do n't move it , " the doctor had told him . " If you move it , it 's going to hurt . " Which made sense , and was why Leaphorn had decided to drive Emma 's sedan  --  which had automatic transmission . Emma had been delighted to see him when he 'd come home from the hospital . She had fussed over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face had frozen into that baffled look Leaphorn had come to dread . She said something meaningless , something that had nothing at all to do with the conversation , and turned her head in that odd 158 *way she 'd developed  --  looking down and to her right . When she 'd looked back , Leaphorn was sure she no longer recognized him . The next few moments formed another of those all too familiar , agonizing episodes of confusion . He and Agnes had taken her into the bedroom , Emma talking in a muddled attempt to communicate something , and then lying on the coverlet , looking lost and helpless . " I ca n't remember , " she 'd said suddenly and clearly , and then she 'd fallen instantly asleep . Tomorrow they would keep their appointment with the specialist at the Gallup hospital . Then they would know . " Alzheimer 's , " the doctor would say , and then the doctor would explain Alzheimer 's , all that information Leaphorn had already read and reread in " The Facts About Alzheimer 's Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause unknown . Possiblya virus . Possibly an imbalance in blood metals . Whateverthe cause , the effect was disruption of the cells on the outer surface of the brain , destroying the reasoning process , eroding the memory until only the moment of existence remains , until  --  in merciful finality  --  there is no longer a signal to keep the lungs breathing , no longer the impulse to keep the heart beating . Cure unknown . For Emma , he had watched this process of unlearning begin . Where had she left her keys ? Walking home from the grocery with the car left parked in the grocery lot . Being brought home by a neighbor after she 'd forgotten how to find the house they 'd lived in for years . Forgetting how to finish a sentence . Who you are . Who your husband is . The literature had warned him what would be coming next . Fairly early , all speech would go . How to talk . How to walk . How to dress . Who is this man who says he is my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaphorn would put aside pretense and prepare Emma , and himself , for whatever would be left of life . Leaphorn shook his head . Now he would think of some- 159
