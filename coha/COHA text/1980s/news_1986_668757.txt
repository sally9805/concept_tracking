One of the stories often told about Msgr . John Egan , the activist priest whose outspoken views made him a center of controversy in the 1960s , is that the late John Cardinal Cody banished him from the Archdiocese of Chicago by exiling him to the University of Notre Dame . But Msgr . Egan , who returned to Chicago in 1983 , a year after Cody ' s death , insists the story isn ' t true . The problem is , few people believe him . " They say , ' Come on , Jack . Admit it , ' " the 69-year-old priest said in a recent interview . The tale , often repeated , is attributed to Cardinal Cody ' s former nemesis , novelist-priest Rev. Andrew Greeley , who acknowledges that he wrote about the events leading to Msgr . Egan ' s departure in one of his columns . " I probably said he was banished , but only in the sense of the environment and atmosphere in the Archdiocese of Chicago , not by any official act on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point I made in my column was that there was precious little room in the archdiocese for someone with his energy , vision and creativity . " Msgr . Egan returned to Chicago April 17 , 1983 , at the invitation of Cardinal Cody ' s successor , Joseph Cardinal Bernardin . He started the next day as head of the newly created Office of Human Relations and Ecumenism . Now , in what some interpret as irony , he works behind Cardinal Cody ' s old desk . Occasionally , he pulls out a shelf from the desk and gazes at a once- private list of Cody contacts taped to its deck . " In essence , Cardinal Bernardin brought me back , put me in my present position and has been totally supportive , " Msgr . Egan said . " Maybe it ' s my age , but since I ' ve come home , I have not heard a harsh word or criticism . " Though Msgr . Egan would like to dispel the myth that he founded the Association of Chicago Priests , an ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have been its catalyst . Soon after his arrival in 1965 , Cody had dismantled the Office of Urban Affairs , which Msgr . Egan was heading . He transferred most of its responsibilities to the Chancery and assigned Msgr . Egan to Presentation Catholic Church in Lawndale on the West Side . " Many priests were saying , ' If Cody can do this to Jack Egan , he can do it to me , ' but I didn ' t have anything to do with the founding , " he said . He was elected to the association ' s original board and served as board chairman from 1969 to 1970 , when he went to Notre Dame . Not everyone was saddened by Msgr . Egan ' s departure . The more conservative Catholics around town considered him a troublemaker . As a young seminarian , Msgr . Egan learned about civil rights at the feet of social activist Saul Alinsky and what tactics he , as a priest , could use to protect those rights and improve Chicago ' s neighborhoods . Their paths crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the experience and methodology Msgr . Egan needed in his church work . In turn , Msgr . Egan provided Alinsky the contacts he needed to build community organizations within the neighborhoods . Later , in Lawndale , Msgr . Egan put that knowledge to work again as he battled real estate operators , corporation executives and his archbishop on human rights matters affecting his ghetto parish . " I know I was not one of Cody ' s favorite people , " Msgr . Egan admitted . " He was suspicious of me . . . I don ' t think he realized how obedient I really was . I came from a family where you respected your superiors . " Msgr . Egan grew up in a family of seven in Ravenswood , on the city ' s North Side , among Irish immigrant families , where life revolved around the home , school and parish . He graduated from DePaul Academy in 1934 , during the Depression . " I saw poverty and unemployment all around me . So many people needed so much , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained on May 1 , 1943 . His first assignment was as an assistant pastor of St. Justin Martyr Parish in Englewood . In 1947 , he was appointed the first director of the Pre-Cana Conference , a marriage preparation program , and Cana Conference , a retreat program for married couples . In 1958 , he was named head of the new urban affairs office . The five years at Presentation  --  during the height of the civil rights struggle  --  were difficult and Msgr . Egan said he learned the meaning of burnout . In 1970 , he ran across Notre Dame ' s president , Rev. Theodore Hesburgh , at O ' Hare International Airport . Hesburgh , an old friend , asked him to help establish an Institute for Urban Studies . Msgr . Egan decided to accept the offer and remained in South Bend for 13 years . In his new work , Msgr . Egan no longer develops programs nor organizes community groups . His current role , he said , is more as a consultant to community and civic groups , and an ombudsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same one facing the city , Msgr . Egan said . " Racism is our most difficult problem , " he said . " We have a city that , in many of its attitudes , has not changed from the civil rights days . The city is hurt by fights in the City Council , which doesn ' t seem to be getting on with its social slate . " CAPTION : PHOTO : The Rev.
