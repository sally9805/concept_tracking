How Fagan managed his sunrise visit to the Queen <P> London 's strangest drama of the summer season continued in the Bow Street Magistrates ' Court last week . Michael Fagan , 33 , the unemployed laborer who had stunned Britain by wandering into Queen Elizabeth 's bedroom three weeks ago , was brought into court for a bizarre 17-min. bail hearing . ( Bail was denied . ) At the same time , a Scotland Yard investigation of the affair revealed just how somnolent the Queen 's protection had been during Fagan 's peregrination through Buckingham Palace . <P> Trespass is not illegal under English law ; criminal intent must be proved . Since Fagan did not threaten to harm the Queen , he was charged with stealing half a bottle of wine worth $5.40 during an earlier visit to the palace on June 7 . <P> During the brief hearing last week , Faganpropped shoeless feet on a wrought-iron rail at the front of the prisoner 's dock , laughed and waved to his wife Christine and mother Ivy . When his solicitor , Maurice Nadeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen after this week 's security improvements , the prisoner bristled . " I told you not to fetch her name up , " Fagan said , glaring . " I would rather plead guilty than have her name dragged into this . " <P> " I do n't want him asking for bail , " Fagan persisted . " I 'd rather go back to the cells . " Detective Chief Superintendent Trevor Lloyd-Hughes agreed , warning that Fagan might skip trial , commit other crimes or hurt himself . " His present state of mind is such that his movements and actions are totally unpredictable , " the policeman said . " He has serious personal problems and has suicidal tendencies . He has twice tried to slash his wrists , and the marks are still to be seen . " <P> Pagan 's suicidal bent , according to Scotland Yard , was what led him to appear at the Queen 's bedside with a piece of broken ashtray in hand , dripping blood on the bedclothes from a cut thumb . Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Dellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's movements had been more extensive than earlier accounts had indicated . Fagan got inside , Dellow said , by climbing a railing near the gates to the Ambassadors ' entrance at 6:45 a.m . He was spotted by a policeman , but in the first breakdown of communications , the police control room let the warning slip . <P> Through an unlocked ground floor window , Faganclimbed into the Stamp Room , where the extensive royal stamp collection is displayed . That set off an alarm , but it was ignored . Fagan went back out the same window , shinnied up a drainpipe , removed his sandals and socks , and climbed to another window , which had just been unlocked by a maid . For the next 15 min. or so , reported Dellow , " he moved through the corridors of the palace unchallenged . One member of the palace domestic staff remembers seeing him , but his behavior was not sufficiently suspicious to cause her to raise the alarm . " He also slipped through warning devices that had been improperly adjusted and finally , Fagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the pictures " along the gallery that connects to the Queen 's quarters .
