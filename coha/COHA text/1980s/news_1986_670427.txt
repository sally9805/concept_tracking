" You know what I have received for my efforts ? " Mr. Kulaczkowski asked . " So far not very much . " He laughed . " I have been asked for bribes . I have been threatened with injury . I have been hauled into court three or four times . I have had my credit cut off . My wife , who works at a factory near here , had her salary garnisheed. // " Farmers who co-signed papers for me at the cooperative bank had their milk payments stolen . I was not allowed to hire apprentices . My cement supplies have been cut down. " // Still , Mr. Kulaczkowski struggles on , producing limited stocks of the building materials in a leaky shed he can not repair for lack of funds. #3 Things Sustain Him He says he is sustained by three things . First , he knows that the farmers in the area , a region of very rich land near Lublin , would buy as many cinder blocks as he could produce and pay well. // Second , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of initiative he is showing , and he shows sheaves of letters from Finance Ministry officials in Warsaw supporting him in his battles with the local authorities. // The third factor , he says , is " my thickheaded stubbornness. " // Mr. Kulaczkowski ' s problems are parochial , but they reflect widely heard complaints from inside and outside the Government that in many areas of Poland , in farm communities as well as factories , decisions and changes approved at the top are sabotaged or ignored by cliques of local bureaucrats. // Mr. Kulaczkowski ' s situation also illustrates what might be accomplished if the proposed Roman Catholic Church fund for private farmers ever gains final Government approval . The concept , which has been a subject of negotiations for three years , calls for the church to administer a hard-currency fund raised in the West and earmarked for agricultural loans and investments. // " If the church fund were functioning , " he said , " I would have somewhere else to go for credit besides the local cooperative bank . But now there is only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy me . " <> <> Helping Polish Farmers // In 1983 , Mr. Kulaczkowski read that a new regulation exempted farm-based workshops from taxes on a sizable portion of their profits . The idea of the provision was precisely to encourage the creation of materials that could benefit Polish farmers . Farmers here make a comparatively good living , but a lack of agricultural investments has kept productivity relatively low. // Mr. Kulaczkowski decided that in addition to cultivating his five acres of tobacco and potatoes , he would build a workshop to make cinder blocks , which farmers needed to build stables and barns . He registered the enterprise and received a start-up loan from the local branch of the cooperative bank. // Mr. Kulaczkowski , who is 35 years old , said he ran into trouble only when he refused to supply and deliver crushed marble free of charge to Jadwiga Chadaj , the director of the bank , who was building a house for her son . The farmer said that he had earlier given cinder blocks and lent his truck to the director to assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding completely within the law , he did not need to offer gifts. // Soon after , he said , he was visited by what he described as two drunken officials from the local office of the tax department . He said the men asked him for " a voluntary fine , " saying that if he did not pay they would assess him heavily. // He told them that farmers paid taxes to the county authorities and were not subject to the tax bureau . He admits he chased them out . Local policemen came and he argued with them . <> <> Neighbors Urged Him to Give Up // Eventually he was tried and found guilty of disrespect for the authorities , although his one-year sentence and fine were annulled by one of the periodic amnesties that have cleared prisons and court calendars of cases involving criminal as well as political cases. // Many of Mr. Kulaczkowski ' s neighbors urged him to give up the fight , saying he could not win . But in one key respect , he is different from his neighbors . Like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , but unlike them he had gone off to work in cities , spending 14 years at the Paris Commune Shipyard in Gdynia. // He was on the strike committee at the shipyard in 1970 , when workers in the Baltic ports took to the streets to protest increases in food prices . Dozens were shot and killed , and Mr. Kulaczkowski spent a week in prison. // When his grandfather was in his 80 ' s and needed looking after , Mr. Kulaczkowski came back to the farm. // " For the people who ran things here , I guess , I was a foreign body , " he said . " I wasn ' t afraid , and I knew the laws and provisions as well or better than they did . " He acted as his own lawyer and often traveled to Warsaw to discuss his case with people at the Finance Ministry . <> <> Seen as Chief Nemesis // Meanwhile , Mrs. Chadaj , the bank director , had been named the primary candidate put up by the Peasant Party , a political grouping allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the area. // By this time , Mr. Kulaczkowski saw her as his chief nemesis . He attended public meetings before the elections and told his story , and he says with delight that as a result of his efforts the party dropped her as its candidate. // This did nothing to improve the bitter relations between the two . Mrs. Chadaj charged the farmer with libeling her by saying he had delivered materials to the house she was building for her son . Despite testimony of witnesses who said they saw such deliveries , the court upheld her claim , but the judgment was annulled by another amnesty. // At the one-room bank , Mrs. Chadaj sat behind a desk with no papers on it . She wore modish clothes , and her blond hair was waved in a style that would have been progressive in Warsaw , let alone in this farm area . She twisted her hands as she spoke. // When a visitor asked whether she had indeed cut off Mr. Kulaczkowski ' s credit and blocked his account , she said she could not recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with many such cases . " No , " she said , " this is the only one out of 1 , 600. " // She said she had acted only at the orders of the tax officials . And yes , she said , she had informed the tax officials of certain matters about Mr. Kulaczkowski , but this was done to protect the interest of the cooperative bank and its members , as was her duty. // When Mr. Kulaczkowski , who accompanied the visitor , then asked her why she tried to throw him out as a member of the bank and whether or not she had demanded and received building supplies from him , she reminded him that he had once been found guilty of libel , and she ended the interview saying , " I do not think I have anything more to say. " // It would take a battery of lawyers a long time to wade through the amassed court records , letters and affidavits to apportion degrees of blame and guilt in the arguments between the banker and the farmer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A man wants to make and sell cinder blocks , farmers want to buy cinder blocks , the Government wants farmers to obtain cinder blocks , and still Mr. Kulaczkowski is not making enough cinder blocks , and soon he may not be able to make any. //
