Despite minor glitches , the shuttle 's eighth flight goes smoothly <P> It was like the inside of a bonfire . " Thus did the pilot of Challenger , Daniel Brandenstein , describe the fiery view from his cockpit last week during the first nighttime launch of a U.S. space shuttle . So bright were the exhaust flames of Challenger 's main engines and twin solid-fuel rocket boosters , which burn at 6000 F , that observers gathered at Kennedy Space Center for the eighth flight of NASA 's Space Transportation System ( STS-8 ) could read newspapers outdoors at 2:32 a.m . Awed by the sight of the flames against the night sky , Flight Commander Richard Truly , a veteran of the shuttle 's second flight , asked ground controllers to record his impressions moments after liftoff . Said he : " The light from the solid rocket motors was about 500 times more than I remember on STS-2 . " <P> The nighttime lift-off was necessary to accomplish one of the mission 's major goals : the launch for the government of India of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the laws of orbital mechanics , it was the only time of day that Challenger could leave Kennedy and be in position to place Insat-1B into the proper orbit over India . <P> On the shuttle 's second day aloft , while orbiting 185 miles above the Pacific , the crew set Insat-1B spinning outside the open doors of the shuttle 's payload bay . The satellite spun near by in space for 45 minutes , then , reflecting the sun 's rays like a giant shiny ice cube , it flawlessly began its week-long climb to an altitude of 22,300 miles , propelled by its own rocket boosters . " The deployment was on time , and the satellite looks good , " reported Mission Specialist Guion S. Bluford Jr. , an aerospace engineer and veteran Air Force pilot who is the first U.S. black astronaut to fly a space mission . <P> Bluford 's report delighted NASA 'S engineers , as did the absence of other serious problems aboard the shuttle when the five-man crew completed its orbital agenda . A key test of the Challenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluford and Mission Specialist Dale Gardner , the arm slowly grasped an 8,500-lb. dumbbell in the middle of the cargo bay , hauled it out into space and brought it back inside . The test was a preparation for STS-13 , scheduled for next April , when NASA hopes the arm will pluck a malfunctioning 5,100-lb. satellite from space and bring it aboard the shuttle for repairs . Throughout the flight , Bluford and other crew members served as subjects for research conducted aloft by Astronaut and Physician William Thornton , into the causes of motion sickness . Fully 40% of shuttle astronauts have complained of nausea while weightless in space . To aid understanding of the malady , crew members affixed electrodes to their skin to record eye movements as they floated about the weightless cabin .
