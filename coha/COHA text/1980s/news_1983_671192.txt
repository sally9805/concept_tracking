The authorities took away his passport in December and now , he says , will not return it because they wrongfully accuse him of recognizing only Rhodesia , not Zimbabwe . Therefore , Home Affairs Minister Herbert Ushewokunze is said to have told him , he should apply to the " Rhodesian authorities " for travel documents. // The logic is elusive , splintered through a prism of racial hostility that is the legacy of the seven-year war between Mr. Smith ' s white Government and black nationalist guerrillas before independence in 1980 . And a talk with Mr. Smith reveals a duality , too ; his voice , these days , is raised against what many others also see as inequities in the Government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe. // Mr. Smith is vehemently opposed to Mr. Mugabe ' s plan for a oneparty state and asserts that Mr. Mugabe has not spoken to him for 20 months because of this opposition. // Yet the condemnation is clouded and made ambivalent by Mr. Smith ' s era in office , when the inequities seemed greater . Zimbabwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ghost , and the yardstick of self-judgment among the new leadership is deemed to be the style of Mr. Smith ' s rule . Thus events may be justified by comparison with white excesses , but not by reference to the hopes that surrounded the ending of white rule here three years ago . <> <> Press Self-Censorship // For instance , the press these days is muzzled by self-censorship , although press freedom is guaranteed constitutionally , and Mr. Smith denounces the fact , saying no one knows what is going on in the country because the newspapers shy away from realities. // Yet in the early days of his rebellion against Britain , censorship was enforced and the newspaper then called The Rhodesia Herald appeared with great slabs of white , open space on its pages , rather than print censored copy . " Smith is saying some of the right things , " a Western diplomat said , " but he is the wrong man to say it. " // Defiantly , however , Mr. Smith continues to speak out , both in Parliament - where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and in interviews. // While in office he embarked on a rebellion against Britain ; presided over a war against the nationalist guerrillas led by Mr. Mugabe and his onetime ally , Joshua Nkomo ; designed a body of legislation that legitimized his campaign for continued white supremacy , and governed a country that , in the end , was 90 percent under martial law . <> <> Old Laws Still Used // But the judgments and assessments of Zimbabwe almost three years after independence are not so monochromatic . The country ' s new leaders still use the same legislation - called emergency powers - to contain opposition , and a war that produced atrocities on all sides left few people untainted . In theory independence wiped the slate clean , but the hostilities linger. // " We were at war " when the emergency powers were devised , Mr. Smith said in an interview , but when peace came there was supposed to be reconciliation . " What sort of reconciliation is this ? " he asked . " Daily they complain about the white people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be down on their knees thanking the colonial regime for making them better off than any other people in the continent of Africa , " he said . Whites , he said , are being intimidated and avoid his presence. // " Farmers say to me , we still support you in our hearts , but we would rather not be seen talking to you , because if we are supporters of the R.F. we are marked men , " he said , referring to his Republican Front , a party that holds 10 of 20 seats reserved for whites in the 100-seat Parliament . " This smacks of Nazism or Communism - after all , what ' s the difference between the Gestapo and the K.G.B. ? " <> <> Views Have Not Softened // Mr. Smith receives visitors with a firm handshake and with views that have not softened over the years . He argued that he would not be doing his job as leader of the whites and of a parliamentary opposition if he shied away from pronunciations that the Government does not like . The terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst thing that could have happened to the white people in this country , " he said , and he persists in the ethic of white indispensability that underpinned his Government. // White expertise , he said , made his country " the most sophisticated part of the African continent . " " When Mr. Mugabe goes to the Organization of African Unity he ' s a hero , " Mr. Smith said . " That ' s partly because his country is the latest to get independence . But he also represents the only country at the Organization of African Unity that can feed itself . This is what the white man did . This is what free enterprise did . " <> <> Harassment of Whites Charged // Despite his reservations , Mr. Smith said , he and his followers " leant over backwards to help the new Government . " But , he asserted , harassment of whites and denial of freedoms built up. // " More and more encroachments have been made on human rights and freedoms , so I am speaking out , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of rearresting , under emergency powers , some of those cleared by high courts of Government-sponsored charges against them . Many Zimbabweans find him an incongruous champion of freedoms that did not extend far in his own days in power but that , nonetheless , are enshrined in the independence Constitution. // The complaints are bitter and seem designed to indicate the themes he used to justify his hold on power . Ultimately , however , the whites are politically irrelevant , although they remain critical to the economy ; the 4 , 800 white farmers grow food for export as well as domestic consumption , and whites still dominate the business world. // Mr. Smith once forecast that black majority rule would never come to Rhodesia , " not in a thousand years . " History proved him wrong , but , to the last , he defends his resistance . " It would be easy for me to go , " he said when asked if he planned to leave Zimbabwe . " But what about those who can ' t leave ? You ' d be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m a beacon of hope . People say to me , please don ' t go because that would have a serious adverse effect . My main mission today is to keep the whites here , because otherwise it will be complete disintegration. " //
