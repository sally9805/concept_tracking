RAGE OF ANGELS stopped her she was going to find a way to practice her pro- fession . She began to make the rounds of Manhattan law offices . She would walk in unannounced , give her name to the recep- tionist and ask to see the head of personnel . Occasionally she was granted an interview , but when she was , Jennifer had the feeling it was out of curiosity . She was a freak and they wanted to see what she looked like in person . Most of the time she was simply informed there were no openings . At the end of six weeks , Jennifer 's money was running out . She would have moved to a cheaper apartment , but there were no cheaper apartments . She began to skip breakfast and lunch , and to have dinner at one of the little corner dinettes where the food was bad but the prices were good .

When Jennifer had gone through her list of large law firms , she armed herself with a list of smaller firms and began to call on them , but her reputation had preceded her even there . She received a lot of propositions from interested males , but no job offers . She was beginning to get desperate . All right , she thought defiantly , if no one wants to hire me , I 'll open my own law office . The catch was that that took money . Ten thousand dollars , at least . She would need enough for rent , telephone , a secretary , law books , a desk and chairs , sta- tionery . . . she could not even afford the stamps .

SIDNEY SHELDON 41Jennifer bought a copy of The New York Times and began to search through the want ads . It was not until she was near the bottom of the page that she came across a small advertisementthat read : Wanted : /Prof man sh sm off w/2 oth/prof men . Rs rent . The last two words appealed to Jennifer enormously . She was not a professional man , but her sex should not matter . She tore out the ad and took the subway down to the address listed . It was a dilapidated old building on lower Broadway . The office was on the tenth floor and the flaking sign on the door read : KENNETH BAILEYACE INVEST GA IONSBeneath it : ROCKEFELLER C LLECTION AG NCYJennifer took a deep breath , opened the door and walked in . She was standing in the middle of a small , windowless office . There were three scarred desks and chairs crowded into the room , two of them occupied . Seated at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man working on some papers . Against the oppositewall at another desk was a man in his early thirties . He had brick-red hair and bright blue eyes . His skin was pale and freckled . He was dressed in tight-fitting jeans , a tee shirt , and white canvas shoes without socks . He was talking into the telephone . " Do n't worry , Mrs. Desser , I have two of my best operativesworking on your case . We should have news of your husband any day now . I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you for a little more expense money . . . No , do n't bother mailing it . The mails are terrible . I 'll be in your neighborhood this afternoon . I 'll stop by and pick it up . " 42 RAGE OF ANGELS He replaced the receiver and looked up and saw Jennifer . He rose to his feet , smiled and held out a strong , firm hand .  --  " I 'm Kenneth Bailey . And what can I do for you this morn- ing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainly , " I  --  I came about your ad . " " Oh . " There was surprise in his blue eyes . The bald-headed man was staring at Jennifer .

" " That 's right . What 's your scam ? " " My  --  ? " Then , realizing , " I 'm an attorney . " Kenneth Bailey studied her skeptically . " And you want to set up an office here ? " Jennifer looked around the dreary office again and visual- ized herself at the empty desk , between these two men . " Perhaps I 'll look a little further , " she said .

On the other hand , there was no way she could ever attract clients to this hellhole . There was one other thing she had to consider . She did not have the sixty dollars . " I 'll take it , " Jennifer said . SIDNEY SHELDON 43 " You wo n't be sorry , " Kenneth Bailey promised . " When do you want to move your things in ? " " They 're in . " Kenneth Bailey painted the sign on the door himself . It read : JENNIFER PARKERATTORNEY AT LAWJennifer studied the sign with mixed feelings . In her deepest depressions it had never occurred to her that she would have her name under that of a private investigator and a bill collector . Yet , as she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling a sense of pride . She was an attorney . The sign on the door proved it . Now that Jennifer had office space , the only thing she lacked was clients . Jennifer could no longer afford even the Steak &; Brew . She made herself a breakfast of toast and coffee on the hot plate she had set up over the radiator in her tiny bathroom . She ate no lunch and had dinner at Chock Full O'Nuts or Zum Zum , where they served large pieces of wurst , slabs of bread and hot potato salad . She arrived at her desk promptly at nine o'clock every morning , but there was nothing for her to do except listen to Ken Bailey and Otto Wenzel talking on the telephone . Ken Bailey 's cases seemed to consist mostly of finding runawayspouses and children , and at first Jennifer was convinced that he was a con man , making extravagant promises and collectinglarge advances . But Jennifer quickly learned that Ken Bailey worked hard and delivered often . He was bright and he was clever. 44 RAGE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly . He would pick it up , mutter a few words into it , write some- thing on a piece of paper and disappear for a few hours . " Oscar does repo 's , " Ken Bailey explained to Jennifer one day . " Repo 's ? " " Yeah . Collection companies use him to get back auto- mobiles , television sets , washing machines  --  you name it . " He looked at Jennifer curiously . " You got any clients ? " " I have some things coming up , " Jennifer said evasively . He nodded . " Do n't let it get you down . Anyone can make a mistake . " Jennifer felt herself flushing . So he knew about her . Ken Bailey was unwrapping a large , thick roast-beef sand- wich . " Like some ? " It looked delicious . " No , thanks , " Jennifer said firmly . " I never eat lunch . " " Okay . " She watched him bite into the juicy sandwich . He saw her expression and said , " You sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I have an appointment . " Ken Bailey watched Jennifer walk out of the office and his face was thoughtful . He prided himself on his ability to read character , but Jennifer Parker puzzled him . From the television and newspaper accounts he had been sure someone had paid this girl to destroy the case against Michael Moretti . After meeting Jennifer , Ken was less certain . He had been married once and had gone through hell , and he held women in low esteem . But something told him that this one was special . She was beautiful , bright and very proud . Jesus ! he said to him- self . Do n't be a fool ! One murder on your conscience is enough . Emma Lazarus was a sentimental idiot , Jennifer thought .

Her resources had dwindled to eighteen dollars , the rent on her apartment was overdue , and her share of the office rent was due in two days . She did not have enough money to stay in New York any longer , and she did not have enough money to leave . Jennifer had gone through the Yellow Pages , calling law offices alphabetically , trying to get a job . She made the calls from telephone booths because she was too embarrassed to let Ken Bailey and Otto Wenzel hear her conversations . The resultswere always the same . No one was interested in hiring her . She would have to return to Kelso and get a job as a legal aide or as a secretary to one of her father 's friends . How he would have hated that ! It was a bitter defeat , but there were no choices left . She would be returning home a failure . The immediate problem facing her was transportation . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad for someone to share driving expenses to Seattle . There was a telephone number and Jennifer called it . There was no answer . She decided she would try again in the morning . The following day , Jennifer went to her office for the last time . Otto Wenzel was out , but Ken Bailey was there , on the telephone , as usual . He was wearing blue jeans and a veeneckcashmere sweater . " I found your wife , " he was saying . " The only problem , pal , is that she does n't want to go home . . . . I know . Who can figure women out ? . . . Okay . I 'll tell you where she 's staying and you can try to sweet-talk her into coming back . " 46 RAGE OF ANGELS He gave the address of a midtown hotel . " My pleasure . " He hung up and swung around to face Jennifer . " You 're late this morning . " " Mr. Bailey , I  --  I 'm afraid I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent money I owe you as soon as I 'm able to . " Ken Bailey leaned back in his chair and studied her . His look made Jennifer uncomfortable . " Will that be all right ? " she asked . " Going back to Washington ? " Jennifer nodded . Ken Bailey said , " Before you leave , would you do me a little favor ? A lawyer friend 's been bugging me to serve some subpoenas for him , and I have n't got time . He pays twelve- fifty for each subpoena plus mileage . Would you help me out ? " One hour later Jennifer Parker found herself in the plush law offices of Peabody &; Peabody . This was the kind of firm she had visualized working in one day , a full partner with a beautiful corner suite . She was escorted to a small back room where a harassed secretary handed her a stack of subpoenas . " Here . Be sure to keep a record of your mileage . You do have a car , do n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you use the subway , keep track of the fares . " " Right . " Jennifer spent the rest of the day delivering subpoenas in the Bronx , Brooklyn and Queens in a downpour . By eight o'clock that evening , she had made fifty dollars . She arrived back at her tiny apartment chilled and exhausted . But at least she had earned some money , her first since coming to New York . And the secretary had told her there were plenty more subpoenas to serve . It was hard work , running all over town , SIDNEY SHELDON 47and it was humiliating . She had had doors slammed in her face , had been cursed at , threatened , and propositioned twice . The prospect of facing another day like that was dismaying ; and yet , as long as she could remain in New York there was hope , no matter how faint . Jennifer ran a hot bath and stepped into it , slowly sinking down into the tub , feeling the luxury of the water lapping over her body . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ache . She decided that what she needed was a good dinner to cheer her up . She would splurge . I 'll treat myself to a real restaurant with tablecloths and napkins , Jennifer thought . Perhaps they 'll have soft music and I 'll have a glass of white wine andJennifer 's thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell . It was an alien sound . She had not had a single visitor since she had moved in two months earlier . It could only be the surly landlady about the overdue rent . Jennifer lay still , hoping she would go away , too weary to move . The doorbell rang again . Reluctantly , Jennifer dragged herself from the warm tub . She slipped on a terry-cloth robe and went to the door . " Who is it ? " A masculine voice on the other side of the door said , " Miss Jennifer Parker ? " " Yes . " " My name is Adam Warner .

Nor did they have long , sensitive hands with carefully manicured nails. 48 RAGE OF ANGELS " Just a moment . " Jennifer unfastened the chain and opened the door . As Adam Warner walked in , Jennifer glanced around the oneroomapartment , seeing it through his eyes , and winced . He looked like a man who was used to better things . " What can I do for you , Mr. Warner ? " Even as she spoke , Jennifer suddenly knew why he was there , and she was filled with a quick sense of excitement .

" 4The law offices of Needham , Finch , Pierce and Warner were located at 30 Wall Street , occupying the entire top floor of the building . There were a hundred and twenty-five lawyers in the firm . The offices smelled of old money and were done in the quiet elegance befitting an organization that representedsome of the biggest names in industry . Adam Warner and Stewart Needham were having their ritual morning tea . Stewart Needham was a dapper , trim man in his late sixties . He had a neat Vandyke beard and wore a tweed suit and vest . He looked as though he belonged to an older era , but as hundreds of opponents had learned to their sorrow through the years , Stewart Needham 's mind belongedvery much to the twentieth century . He was a titan , but his name was known only in the circles where it mattered . He preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome of legislation , high government appointments and national politics . He was a New Englander , born and reared taciturn. 4950 RAGE OF ANGELS I SIDNEY SHELDON 51Adam Warner was married to Needham 's niece Mary Beth , and was Needham 's protege . Adam 's father had been a respected senator . Adam himself was a brilliant lawyer . When he had been graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School , he had had offers from prestigious law firms all over the country . He chose Needham , Finch and Pierce , and seven years later became a partner . Adam was physically attractive and charming , and his intelligence seemed to add an extra dimension to him . He had an easy sureness about himself that women found challenging . Adam had long since developed a system for dissuading overamorous female clients . He had been married to Mary Beth for fourteen years and did not approve of extramarital affairs . " More tea , Adam ? " Stewart Needham asked . " No , thanks . " Adam Warner hated tea , and he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did not want to hurt his partner 's feelings . It was a brew that Needham concocted himself and it was dreadful . Stewart Needham had two things on his mind and , typically , he began with the pleasant news . " I had a meeting with a few friends last night , " Needham said . A few friends would be a group of the top power brokers in the country . " They 're considering asking you to run for United States senator , Adam . " Adam felt a sense of elation . Knowing Stewart Needham 's cautious nature , Adam was certain that the conversation had been more than casual or Needham would not have brought it up now . " The big question , of course , is whether you 're interested . It would mean a lot of changes in your life . " Adam Warner was aware of that . If he won the election , it would mean moving to Washington , D.C. , giving up his law practice , starting a whole new life . He was sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure about himself . And yet , he had been reared to assume responsibility . Also , he had to admit to himself that there was a pleasure in power . " I 'd be very interested , Stewart . " Stewart Needham nodded with satisfaction . " Good . They 'll be pleased . " He poured himself another cup of the dreadful brew and casually broached the other subject that was on his mind . " There 's a little job the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Association would like you to handle , Adam . Should n't take you more than an hour or two . " " What is it ? " " It 's the Michael Moretti trial . Apparently , someone got to one of Bobby Di Silva 's young assistants and paid her off . " " I read about it . The canary . " " Right .

" " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl behaved illegally or unethically , and then recommend disbarmentproceedings . She 'll be served with a notice to show cause and they 'll handle the rest of it . It 's just routine . " Adam was puzzled by something . " Why me , Stewart ? We have a couple of dozen young lawyers around here who could handle this . " " Our revered District Attorney specifically asked for you . He wants to make sure nothing goes wrong . As we 're both aware , " he added dryly , " Bobby 's not the most forgiving man in the world . He wants the Parker woman 's hide nailed up on his wall . " Adam Warner sat there , thinking about his busy schedule . " You never know when we might need a favor from theD.A. ' s office , Adam . Quid pro quo . It 's all cut and dried . " " All right , Stewart . " Adam rose to his feet . " Sure you wo n't have some more tea ? " " No , thanks . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAGE OF ANGELS When Adam Warner returned to his office he rang for one of his paralegal assistants , Lucinda , a bright , young Black woman . " Cindy , get me all the information you can on an attorney named Jennifer Parker . " She grinned and said , " The yellow canary . " Everybody knew about her . Late that afternoon Adam Warner was studying the tran- script of the court proceedings in the case of The People of New York v. Michael Moretti . Robert Di Silva had had it de- livered by special messenger . It was long past midnight when Adam finished . He had asked Mary Beth to attend a dinner party without him , and had sent out for sandwiches . When Adam was through reading the transcript , there was no doubt in his mind that Michael Moretti would have been found guilty by the jury if fate had not intervened in the form of Jennifer Parker . Di Silva had prosecuted the case flawlessly . Adam turned to the transcript of the deposition that had been taken in Judge Waldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college graduate ? PARKER : Yes , sir .

I thought he was on your staff . DI SILVA : What made you think that ? SIDNEY SHELDON 53PARKER : I 've told you . I saw him talking to you and then he came over to me with this envelope and he called me by name , and he said you wanted me to deliver it to the witness .

PARKER : I 'm not going to let you twist my words around . No one paid me anything . DI SILVA : You did it as a favor ? PARKER : No . I thought I was acting on your instructions . DI SILVA : You said the man called you by name . PARKER : Yes . DI SILVA : How did he know your name ? PARKER : I do n't know . DI SILVA : Oh , come on . You must have some idea . Maybe it was a lucky guess . Maybe he just looked around that courtroom and said , There 's someone who looks like her name could be Jennifer Parker . Do you think that was it ? PARKER : I 've told you . I do n't know . DI SILVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PARKER : Mr. Di Silva , we 've gone all over this . You'vebeen questioning me now for five hours . I 'm tired .

There 's only one way you 're going to get out54 RAGE OF ANGELSof it . Stop lying and start telling the truth . PARKER : I 've told you the truth . I 've told you everything I know . DI SILVA : Except the name of the man who handed you the envelope . I want his name and I want to know how much he paid you . There were thirty more pages of transcript . Robert Di Silva had done everything but beat Jennifer Parker with a rubber hose . She had stuck to her story . Adam closed the transcript and wearily rubbed his eyes . It was two A.M.Tomorrow he would dispose of the Jennifer Parker matter . To Adam Warner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so easily . Because Adam was a methodical man he ran a check on Jennifer Parker 's background . As far as he could determine , she had no crime connections , nor was there anything to link her with Michael Moretti . There was something about the case that disturbed Adam . Jennifer Parker 's defense was too flimsy . If she were working for Moretti , he would have protected her with a reasonably plausible story . As it was , her story was so transparently naive that it had a ring of truth about it . At noon Adam received a call from the District Attorney . " How goes it , Adam ? " " Fine , Robert . " " I understand you 're handling the hatchet-man job on the Jennifer Parker matter . " Adam Warner winced at the phrase . " I 've agreed to make a recommendation , yes . " " I 'm going to put her away for a long time . " Adam was taken aback by the hatred in the District Attorney 's voice . " Easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva chuckled . " I 'll leave that to you , my friend . " HisSIDNEY SHELDON 55tone changed . " I hear on the grapevine that you may be movingto Washington soon . I want you to know that you can count on my full support . " Which was considerable , Adam Warner knew . The District Attorney had been around a long time . He knew where the bodies were buried and he knew how to squeeze the most out of that information . " Thanks , Robert . I appreciate that . " " My pleasure , Adam . I 'll wait to hear from you . " Meaning Jennifer Parker . The quid pro quo Stewart Needhamhad mentioned , with the girl used as a pawn . Adam Warnerthought about Robert Di Silva 's words : I 'm going to put her away for a long time . From reading the transcript , Adam judged that there was no real evidence against Jennifer Parker . Unless she confessed , or unless someone came forward with information that proved criminal complicity , Di Silva would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam to give him his vengeance . The cold , harsh words of the transcript were clear-cut , and yet Adam wished he could have heard the tone of Jennifer Parker 's voice when she denied her guilt . There were pressing matters claiming Adam 's attention , importantcases involving major clients . It would have been easy to go ahead and carry out the wishes of Stewart Needham , Judge Lawrence Waldman and Robert Di Silva , but some instinctmade Adam Warner hesitate . He picked up Jennifer Parker 's file again , scribbled some notes and began to make some long-distance telephone calls . Adam had been given a responsibility and he intended to carry it through to the best of his ability . He was all too familiar with the long , back-breaking hours of study and hard work it took to become an attorney and to pass the bar . It was a prize that took years to attain , and he was not about to deprive someone of it unless he was cerain there was justification . The following morning Adam Warner was on a plane to56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer Parker 's law professors , with the head of a law firm where she had clerked for two summers , and with some of Jennifer 's former classmates . Stewart Needham telephoned Adam in Seattle . " What are you doing up there , Adam ? You 've got a big case load waiting for you back here . That Parker thing should have been a snap . " " A few questions have arisen , " Adam said carefully . " I 'll be back in a day or so , Stewart . " There was a pause . " I see . Let 's not waste any more time on her than we have to . " By the time Adam Warner left Seattle , he felt he knew JenniferParker almost as well as she knew herself . He had built up a portrait of her in his mind , a mental identikit , with pieces filled in by her law professors , her landlady , members of the law firm where she had served as a clerk , and classmates . The picture that Adam had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him . Unless Jennifer Parker was the most consummate actress who ever lived , there was no way she could have been involved in a plot to free a man like Michael Moretti . Now , almost two weeks after he had had that morning conversation with Stewart Needham , Adam Warner found himself facing the girl whose past he had been exploring . Adam had seen newspaper pictures of Jennifer , but they had not prepared him for the impact she made in person . Even in an old robe , without makeup , and her dark brown hair bath-damp , she was breathtaking . Adam said , " I 've been assigned to investigate your part in the Michael Moretti trial , Miss Parker . " " Have you now ! " Jennifer could feel an anger rising in her . It started as a spark and became a flame that exploded insideSIDNEY SHELDON 5iher . They still were not through with her . They were going to make her pay for the rest of her life .

" If I hac any money , do you think I 'd be living in a place like this ? " He voice was beginning to choke up . " I  --  I do n't care what yot do . All I want is to be left alone . Now please go away ! " Jennifer turned and fled into the bathroom , slamming the door behind her . She stood against the sink , taking deep breaths , wiping thc tears from her eyes . She knew she had behaved stupidly . That ' : twice , she thought wryly . She should have handled Adam War . ner differently . She should have tried to explain , instead of attacking him . Maybe then she would not be disbarred . Bul she knew that was wishful thinking . Sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to serve het with an order to show cause , and the formal machinery would be set in motion . There would be a trial panel of three attorneyswho would make their recommendation to the Disci. plinary Board which would make its report to the Board of Governors . The recommendation was a foregone conclusion : disbarment . She would be forbidden to practice law in the state of New York . Jennifer thought bitterly , There 's one bright side to this . I can get into the Guinness Book of Records for the shortest law career in history . She stepped into the bath again and lay back , letting the still-warm water lap at her , soothing away her tension . At this moment she was too tired to care what happened to her . She closed her eyes and let her mind drift . She was half asleep when the chill of the water awakened her . She had no idea how long she had lain in the tub . Reluctantly she stepped out and began toweling herself dry . She was no longer hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her appetite away . Jennifer combed her hair and creamed her face and decided she would go to bed without dinner . In the morning she would telephone about the ride to Seattle . She opened the bathroom door and walked into the living room . Adam Warner was seated in a chair , leafing through a magazine . He looked up as Jennifer came into the room , naked . " I 'm sorry , " Adam said . " I  --  " Jennifer gave a small cry of alarm and fled to the bathroom , where she put on her robe . When she stepped out to confront Adam again , Jennifer was furious . " The inquisition is over . I asked you to leave . " Adam put the magazine down and said quietly , " Miss Parker , do you think we could discuss this calmly for a moment ? " " No ! " All the old rage boiled up in Jennifer again . " I have nothing more to say to you or your damned disciplinary committee .

" I 'm sorry , Miss Parker . " He rose to his feet and started for the door . " Just a minute ! " Adam turned . " Forgive me , " she said . " I  --  everybody seems to be the enemy . I apologize . " " Your apology is accepted . " Jennifer was suddenly aware of the flimsy robe she was wearing . " If you still want to ask me questions , I 'll put some clothes on and we can talk .

" Not too many people know about this place , " Adam Warner said when they had been seated . " It 's owned by a young French couple who used to work at Les Pyrenees . The food is excellent . " Jennifer had to take Adam 's word for it . She was incapable of tasting anything . She had not eaten all day , but she was so nervous that she was unable to force any food down her throat . She tried to relax , but it was impossible . No matter how much he pretended , the charming man seated opposite her was the enemy . And he was charming , Jennifer had to admit . He was amusing and attractive , and under other circumstancesJennifer would have enjoyed the evening enormously ; but these were not other circumstances .

He had recently returned from a trip to Japan where he had met with top government officials . A special banquet had been preparedin his honor . " Have you ever eaten chocolate-covered ants ? " Adam asked . " No . " He grinned . " They 're better than the chocolate-covered grasshoppers . " He talked about a hunting trip he had taken the year before in Alaska , where he had been attacked by a bear . He talked about everything but why they were there . Jennifer had been steeling herself for the moment when60 RAGE OF ANGELSAdam would begin to interrogate her , yet when he finally brought up the subject , her whole body went rigid . He had finished dessert and he said quietly , " I 'm going to ask you some questions , and I do n't want you to get upset . Okay ? " There was a sudden lump in Jennifer 's throat . She was not sure she would be able to speak . She nodded . " I want you to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , everything you felt . Take your time . " Jennifer had been prepared to defy him , to tell him to do whatever he pleased about her . But somehow , sitting across from Adam Warner , listening to his quiet voice , Jennifer 's resistancewas gone . The whole experience was still so vivid in her mind that it hurt just to think about it . She had spent more than a month trying to forget it . Now he was asking her to go through it again . She took a deep , shaky breath and said , " All right . " Haltingly , Jennifer began to recount the events in the courtroom , gradually speaking more rapidly as it all came to life again . Adam sat there quietly listening , studying her , saying nothing . When Jennifer had finished , Adam said , " The man who gave you the envelope  --  was he in the District Attorney 's office earlier that morning when you were sworn in ? " " I 've thought about that . I honestly do n't remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were all strangers . " " Had you ever seen the man before , anywhere ? " Jennifer shook her head helplessly . " I ca n't recall . I do n't think so . " " You said you saw him talking to the District Attorney just before he walked over to give you the envelope . Did you see the District Attorney hand him the envelope ? " " I  --  no . " SIDNEY SHELDON 61 " Did you actually see this man talking to the District Attorney , or was he just in the group around him ? " Jennifer closed her eyes for a second , trying to bring back that moment . " I 'm sorry . Everything was so confused . I  --  I just do n't know . " " Do you have any idea how he could have known your name ? " " No . " " Or why he selected you ? " " That one 's easy . He probably knew an idiot when he saw one . " She shook her head . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . " Adam said , " A lot of pressure is being brought to bear on this . District Attorney Di Silva has been after Michael Moretti for a long time . Until you came along , he had an airtight case . The D.A . ' s not very happy with you . " " I 'm not very happy with me , either . " Jennifer could not blame Adam Warner for what he was about to do . He was just carrying out his job . They were out to get her and they had succeeded . Adam Warner was not responsible ; he was merely the instrument they were using . Jennifer felt a sudden , overwhelming urge to be alone . She did not want anyone else to see her misery . " I 'm sorry , " she apologized . " I  --  I 'm not feeling very well . I 'd like to go home , please . " Adam studied her a moment . " Would it make you feel any better if I told you I 'm going to recommend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several seconds for Adam 's words to sink in . Jenniferstared at him , speechless , searching his face , looking into those gray-blue eyes behind the horn-rimmed glasses . " Do  --  do you really mean that ? " " Being a lawyer is very important to you , is n't it ? " Adam asked . Jennifer thought of her father and his comfortable little law62 RAGE OF ANGELSoffice , and of the conversations they used to have , and the long years of law school , and their hopes and dreams . We 're going into partnership . You hurry up and get that law degree . " Yes , " Jennifer whispered . " If you can get over a rough beginning , I have a feeling you 'll be a very good one . " Jennifer gave him a grateful smile . " Thank you . I 'm going to try . " She said the words over again in her mind . I 'm going to try ! It did not matter that she shared a small and dingy office with a seedy private detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law office . She was a member of the legal profession , and they were going to allow her to practice law . She was filled with a feeling of exultation . She looked across at Adam and knew she would be forever grateful to this man . The waiter had begun to clear the dishes from the table . Jennifer tried to speak , but it came out a cross between a laugh and a sob . " Mr. Warner  --  " He said gravely , " After all we 've been through together , I think it should be Adam . " " Adam  --  " " Yes ? " " I hope it wo n't ruin our relationship , but  --  " Jennifer moaned , " I 'm starved ! " 5The next few weeks raced by . Jennifer found herself busy from early morning until late at night , serving summonses  --  court orders to appear to answer a legal action  --  and subpoenas  --  courtorders to appear as a witness . She knew that her chances of getting into a large law firm were nonexistent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one would dream of hiring her . She would just have to find some way to make a reputation for herself , to begin all over . In the meantime , there was the pile of summonses and subpoenas on her desk from Peabody &; Peabody . While it was not exactly practicing law , it was twelve-fifty and expenses . Occasionally , when Jennifer worked late , Ken Bailey would take her out to dinner . On the surface he was a cynical man , but Jennifer felt that it was a facade . She sensed that he was lonely . He had been graduated from Brown University and was bright and well-read . She could not imagine why he was satisfied to spend his life working out of a dreary office , trying6364 RAGE OF ANGELS to locate stray husbands and wives . It was as though he had re- signed himself to being a failure and was afraid to try for success . Once , when Jennifer brought up the subject of his mar- riage , he growled at her , " It 's none of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otto Wenzel was completely different . The short , potbellied little man was happily married . He regarded Jennifer as a daughter and he constantly brought her soups and cakes that his wife made . Unfortunately , his wife was a terrible cook , but Jennifer forced herself to eat whatever Otto Wenzel brought in , because she did not want to hurt his feelings . One Friday evening Jennifer was invited to the Wenzel home for dinner . Mrs. Wenzel had prepared stuffed cabbage , her specialty . The cabbage was soggy , the meat inside was hard , and the rice half- cooked . The whole dish swam in a lake of chicken fat . Jennifer attacked it bravely , taking small bites and pushing the food around on her plate to make it seem as though she were eating . " How do you like it ? " Mrs. Wenzel beamed . " It  --  it 's one of my favorites . " From that time on , Jennifer had dinner at the Wenzel 's every Friday night , and Mrs. Wenzel always prepared Jen- nifer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone call from the personal secretary of Mr. Peabody , Jr . " Mr. Peabody would like to see you this morning at eleven o'clock . Be prompt , please . " " Yes , ma'am . " In the past , Jennifer had only dealt with secretaries and law clerks in the Peabody office . It was a large , prestigious firm , one that young lawyers dreamed of being invited to join . On the way to keep her appointment , Jennifer began to fantasize . If Mr. Peabody himself wanted to see her , it had to be about SIDNEY SHELDON 65something important . He probably had seen the light and was going to offer her a job as a lawyer with his firm , to give her a chance to show what she could do . She was going to surprise all of them . Some day it might even be Peabody , Peabody &; Parker . Jennifer killed thirty minutes in the corridor outside the office , and at exactly eleven o'clock , she entered the reception room . She did not want to seem too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally ushered into the office of Mr. Peabody , Jr . He was a tall , thin man wearing a vested suit and shoes that had been made for him in London . He did not invite her to sit down . " Miss Potter  --  " He had an unpleasant , high-pitched voice . " Parker . " He picked up a piece of paper from his desk . " This is a summons . I would like you to serve it . " At that instant , Jennifer sensed that she was not going to become a member of the firm . Mr. Peabody , Jr. , handed Jennifer the summons and said , " Your fee will be five hundred dollars . " Jennifer was sure she had misunderstood him . " Did you say five hundred dollars ? " " That is correct . If you are successful , of course . " " There 's a problem , " Jennifer guessed . " Well , yes , " Mr. Peabody , Jr. , admitted . " We 've been trying to serve this man for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lives on an estate in Long Island and he never leaves his house . To be quite truthful , a dozen people have tried to serve him . He has a bodyguard-butler who keeps everyone away . " Jennifer said , " I do n't see how I  --  " Mr. Peabody , Jr . leaned forward . " There 's a great deal of money at stake here . But I ca n't get William Carlisle into court unless I can serve him , Miss Potter . " Jennifer did not bother to correct him . " Do you think you can handle it ? " 66 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 67Jennifer thought about what she could do with five hundred dollars . " I 'll find a way . " At two o'clock that afternoon , Jennifer was standing outside the imposing estate of William Carlisle . The house itself was Georgian , set in the middle of ten acres of beautiful , carefully tended grounds . A curving driveway led to the front of the house , which was framed by graceful fir trees . Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since it was impossible to get into the house , the only solution was to find a way to get Mr. William Carlisle to come out . Half a block down the street was a gardener 's truck . Jenniferstudied the truck a moment , then walked over to it , looking for the gardeners . There were three of them at work , and they were Japanese . Jennifer walked up to the men . " Who 's in charge here ? " One of them straightened up . " I am . " " I have a little job for you . . . " Jennifer began . " Sorry , miss . Too busy . " " This will only take five minutes . " " No . Impossible to  --  " " I 'll pay you one hundred dollars . " The three men stopped to look at her .

" Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway of William Carlisle 's estate and Jennifer and the three gardeners got out . Jennifer looked around , selected a beautiful tree next to the front door and said to the gardeners , " Dig it up . " They took their spades from the truck and began to dig . Before a minute had gone by , the front door burst open and an enormous man in a butler 's uniform came storming out . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " " Long Island Nursery , " Jennifer said crisply . " We 're takin ' out all these trees . " The butler stared at her . " You 're what ? " Jennifer held up a piece of paper . " I have an order here to dig up these trees . " " That 's impossible ! Mr. Carlisle would have a fit ! " He turned to the gardeners . " You stop that ! " " Look , mister , " Jennifer said , " I 'm just doin ' my job . " She looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! " the butler shouted . " I 'm telling you there 's been amistake !

" He 's out on a job in Brooklyn . He should be back in the office around six . " The butler glared at her , furious . " Just a minute ! Do n't do anything until I return . " " Keep diggin ' , " Jennifer told the gardeners . The butler turned and hurried into the house , slamming the door behind him . A few moments later the door opened and the butler returned , accompanied by a tiny middle-aged man . " Would you mind telling me what the devil is going on here ? " " What business is it of yours ? " Jennifer demanded . " I 'll tell you what business it is of mine , " he snapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my property . " " In that case , Mr. Carlisle , " Jennifer said , " I have something for you . " She reached in her pocket and put the summonsin his hand . She turned to the gardeners . " You can stop digging now . " Early the next morning Adam Warner telephoned . Jennifer recognized his voice instantly . " I thought you would like to know , " Adam said , " that the68 RAGE OF ANGELSdisbarment proceedings have been officially dropped . You have nothing more to worry about . " Jennifer closed her eyes and said a silent prayer of thanks . " I  --  I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate what you 've done . " " Justice is n't always blind . " Adam did not mention the scene he had had with Stewart Needham and Robert Di Silva . Needham had been disappointed , but philosophical . The District Attorney had carried on like a raging bull . " You let that bitch get away with this ? Jesus Christ , she 's Mafia , Adam ! Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And on and on , until Adam had tired of it . " All the evidence against her was circumstantial , Robert . She was in the wrong place at the wrong time and she got mousetrapped . That does n't spell Mafia to me . " Finally Robert Di Silva had said , " Okay , so she 's still a lawyer . I just hope to God she practices in New York , because the minute she sets foot in any of my courtrooms , I 'm going to wipe her out . " Now , talking to Jennifer , Adam said nothing of this . Jenniferhad made a deadly enemy , but there was nothing that could be done about it . Robert Di Silva was a vindictive man , and Jennifer was a vulnerable target . She was bright and idealistic and achingly young and lovely . Adam knew he must never see her again . There were days and weeks and months when Jennifer was ready to quit . The sign on the door still read Jennifer Parker , Attorney at Law , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not practicing law : Her days were spent running around in rain and sleet and snow , delivering subpoenasand summons to people who hated her for it . Now and then she accepted a pro bono case , helping the elderly get food stamps , solving various legal problems of ghetto Blacks andSIDNEY SHELDON 69Puerto Ricans and other underprivileged people . But she felt trapped . The nights were worse than the days . They were endless , for Jennifer had insomnia and when she did sleep , her dreams were filled with demons . It had begun the night her mother had deserted Jennifer and her father , and she had not been able to exorcise whatever it was that was causing her nightmares . She was consumed by loneliness . She went out on occasionaldates with young lawyers , but inevitably she found herselfcomparing them to Adam Warner , and they all fell short . There would be dinner and a movie or a play , followed by a struggle at her front door . Jennifer was never sure whether they expected her to go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had had to climb up and down four steep flights of stairs . There were times when she was strongly tempted to say Yes , just to have someone with her for the night , someone to hold , someone to share herself with . But she needed more in her bed than a warm body that talked ; she needed someone who cared , someone for whom she could care . The most interesting men who propositioned Jennifer were all married , and she flatly refused to go out with any of them . She remembered a line from Billy Wilder 's wonderful film The Apartment : " When you 're in love with a married man you should n't wear mascara . " Jennifer 's mother had destroyed a marriage , had killed Jennifer 's father . She could never forget that . Christmas came and New Year 's Eve , and Jennifer spent them alone . There had been a heavy snowfall and the city looked like a gigantic Christmas card . Jennifer walked the streets , watching pedestrians hurrying to the warmth of their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptiness. 70 RAGE OF ANGELS She missed her father terribly . She was glad when the holidays were over . Nineteen seventy is going to be a better year , Jennifer told herself . On Jennifer 's worst days , Ken Bailey would cheer her up . He took her out to Madison Square Garden to watch the Rangers play , to a disco club and to an occasional play or movie . Jennifer knew he was attracted to her , and yet he kept a barrier between them . In March , Otto Wenzel decided to move to Florida with his wife . " My bones are getting too old for these New York winters , " he told Jennifer . " I 'll miss you . " Jennifer meant it . She had grown genuinely fond of him . " Take care of Ken . " Jennifer looked at him quizzically . " He never told you , did he ? " " Told me what ? " He hesitated , then said , " His wife committed suicide . He blames himself . " Jennifer was shocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " She caught Ken in bed with a young blond man . " " Oh , my God ! " " She shot Ken and then turned the gun on herself . He lived . She did n't . " " How awful ! I had no idea that . . . that  --  " " I know . He smiles a lot , but he carries his own hell with him . " " Thanks for telling me . " When Jennifer returned to the office , Ken said , " So old Otto 's leaving us . " " Yes . " SIDNEY SHELDON 71Ken Bailey grinned . " I guess it 's you and me against the world . " " I guess so . " And in a way , Jennifer thought , it is true . Jennifer looked at Ken with different eyes now . They had lunches and dinners together , and Jennifer could detect no signs of homosexuality about him but she knew that Otto Wenzel had told her the truth : Ken Bailey carried his own private hell with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were usually poorly dressed , bewildered and , in some instances , out-andoutnut cases . Prostitutes came in to ask Jennifer to handle their bail , and Jennifer was amazed at how young and lovely some of them were . They became a small but steady source of income . She could not find out who sent them to her . When she mentioned it to Ken Bailey , he shrugged in a gesture of ignorance and walked away . Whenever a client came to see Jennifer , Ken Bailey would discreetly leave . He was like a proud father , encouraging Jennifer to succeed . Jennifer was offered several divorce cases and turned them down . She could not forget what one of her law professors had once said : Divorce is to the practice of law what proctologyis to the practice of medicine . Most divorce lawyers had bad reputations . The maxim was that when a married couple saw red , lawyers saw green . A high-priced divorce lawyerwas known as a bomber , for he would use legal high explosivesto win a case for a client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wife and the children . A few of the clients who came into Jennifer 's office were different in a way that puzzled her. 72 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 73They were well dressed , with an air of affluence about them , and the cases they brought to her were not the nickel-anddimecases Jennifer had been accustomed to handling . There were estates to be settled that amounted to substantial sums of money , and lawsuits that any large firm would have been delighted to represent . " Where did you hear about me ? " Jennifer would ask . The replies she got were always evasive . From a friend .. . I read about you . . . your name was mentioned at a party . . . It was not until one of her clients , in the course of explaining his problems , mentioned Adam Warner that Jennifer suddenly understood . " Mr. Warner sent you to me , did n't he ? " The client was embarrassed . " Well , as a matter of fact , he suggested it might be better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to telephone Adam . After all , she did owe him a debt of thanks . She would be polite , but formal . Naturally , she would not let him get the impression that she was calling him for any reason other than to express her appreciation . She rehearsed the conversation over and over in her mind . When Jennifer finally got up enough nerve to telephone , a secretary informed her that Mr. Warner was in Europe and was not expected back for several weeks . It was an anticlimax that left Jennifer depressed . She found herself thinking of Adam Warner more and more often . She kept remembering the evening he had come to her apartment and how badly she had behaved . He had been wonderful to put up with her childish behavior when she had taken out her anger on him . Now , in addition to everything else he had done for her , he was sending her clients . Jennifer waited three weeks and then telephoned Adam again . This time he was in South America . " Is there any message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No message . " Jennifer tried to put Adam out of her mind , but it was impossible . She wondered whether he was married or engaged . She wondered what it would be like to be Mrs. Adam Warner . She wondered if she were insane . From time to time Jennifer came across the name of MichaelMoretti in the newspapers or weekly magazines . There was an in-depth story in the New Yorker magazine on AntonioGranelli and the eastern Mafia Families . Antonio Granelliwas reported to be in failing health and Michael Moretti , his son-in-law , was preparing to take over his empire . Life magazine ran a story about Michael Moretti 's lifestyle , and at the end of the story it spoke of Moretti 's trial . Camillo Stela was serving time in Leavenworth , while Michael Moretti was free . It reminded its readers how Jennifer Parker had destroyedthe case that would have sent him to prison or the electric chair . As Jennifer read the article , her stomach churned . The electric chair ? She could cheerfully have pulled the switch on Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the educationwas priceless . Over the months , Jennifer came to know every room in the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street and the people who inhabited them . When one of her clients was arrested for shoplifting , mugging , prostitution or drugs , Jennifer would head downtown to arrange bail , and bargaining was a way of life . " Bail is set at five hundred dollars . " " Your Honor , the defendant does n't have that much money . If the court will reduce bail to two hundred dollars , he can go back to work and keep supporting his family . " " Very well . Two hundred . " " Thank you , Your Honor . " Jennifer got to know the supervisor of the complaint room , where copies of the arrest reports were sent. 74 RAGE OF ANGELS " You again , Parker ! For God 's sake , do n't you ever sleep ? " " Hi , Lieutenant . A client of mine was picked up on a vagrancy charge . May I see the arrest sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me something , honey . Why would you come down here at three A.M. to defend a vagrant ? " Jennifer grinned . " It keeps me off the streets . " She became familiar with night court , held in Room 218 of the Centre Street courthouse . It was a smelly , overcrowded world , with its own arcane jargon . Jennifer was baffled by it at first . " Parker , your client is booked on bedpain . " " My client is booked on what ? " " Bedpain . Burglary , with a Break , Enter , Dwelling , Person , Armed , Intent to kill , at Night . Get it ? " " Got it . " " I 'm here to represent Miss Luna Tamer . " " Jesus H. Christ ! " " Would you tell me what the charges are ? " " Hold on . I 'll find her ticket . Luna Tamer . That 's a hot one . . . here we are . Pross . Picked up by CWAC , down below . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? CWAC is the City-Wide Anti-Crime unit . A pross is a hooker , and down below is south of Forty-Second Street . Capish ? " " Capish . " Night court depressed Jennifer . It was filled with a human tide that ceaselessly surged in and out , washed up on the shores of justice . There were more than a hundred and fifty cases heard each night . There were whores and transvestites , stinking , battered SIDNEY SHELDON 75drunks and drug addicts . There were Puerto Ricans and Mexicans and Jews and Irish and Greeks and Italians , and they were accused of rape and theft and possession of guns or dope or assault or prostitution . And they all had one thing in common : They were poor . They were poor and defeated and lost . They were the dregs , the misfits whom the affluent society had passed by . A large proportion of them came from Central Harlem , and because there was no more room in the prison system , all but the most serious offenders were dismissedor fined . They returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where in three and one-half square miles there lived two hundred and thirty-three thousand Blacks , eight thousand Puerto Ricans , and an estimatedone million rats . The majority of clients who came to Jennifer 's office were people who had been ground down by poverty , the system , themselves . They were people who had long since surrendered . Jennifer found that their fears fed her self-confidence . She did not feel superior to them . She certainly could not hold herself up as a shining example of success , and yet she knew there was one big difference between her and her clients : She would never give up . Ken Bailey introduced Jennifer to Father Francis Joseph Ryan . Father Ryan was in his late fifties , a radiant , vital man with crisp gray-and-black hair that curled about his ears . He was always in serious need of a haircut . Jennifer liked him at once . From time to time , when one of his parishioners would disappear , Father Ryan would come to Ken and enlist his services . Invariably , Ken would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . There would never be a charge . " It 's a down payment on heaven , " Ken would explain . One afternoon when Jennifer was alone Father Ryan dropped by the office. 76 RAGE OF ANGELS " Ken 's out , Father Ryan . He wo n't be back today . " " It 's really you I wanted to see , Jennifer , " Father Ryan said . He sat down in the uncomfortable old wooden chair in front of Jennifer 's desk . " I have a friend who has a bit of a problem . " That was the way he always started out with Ken . " Yes , Father ? " " She 's an elderly parishioner , and the poor dear 's having trouble getting her Social Security payments . She moved into my neighborhood a few months ago and some damned corn- puter lost all her records , may it rust in hell . " " I see . " " I knew you would , " Father Ryan said , getting to his feet . " I 'm afraid there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jennifer smiled . " Do n't worry about that . I 'll try to straighten things out . " She had thought it would be a simple matter , but it had taken her almost three days to get the computer repro- grammed . One morning a month later , Father Ryan walked into Jennifer 's office and said , " I hate to bother you , my dear , but I have a friend who has a bit of a problem . I 'm afraid he has no  --  " He hesitated . "  --  Money , " Jennifer guessed . " Ah ! That 's it . Exactly . But the poor fellow needs help badly . " " All right . Tell me about him . " " His name is Abraham . Abraham Wilson . He 's the son of one of my parishioners . Abraham is serving a life sentence in Sing Sing for killing a liquor store owner during a holdup . " " If he was convicted and is serving his sentence , I do n't see how I can help , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not his problem . " SIDNEY SHELDON 77 " It is n't ? " " No . A few weeks ago Abraham killed another man  --  a fellow prisoner named Raymond Thorpe . They 're going to try him for murder , and go for the death penalty . " Jennifer had read something about the case . " If I remember correctly , he beat the man to death . " " So they say . " Jennifer picked up a pad and a pen . " Do you know if there were any witnesses ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " How many ? " " Oh , a hundred or so . It happened in the prison yard , you see . " " Terrific . What is it you want me to do ? " Father Ryan said simply , " Help Abraham . " Jennifer put down her pen . " Father , it 's going to take your Boss to help him . " She sat back in her chair . " He 's going in with three strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted murderer , and he killed another man in front of a hundred witnesses . Assuming he did it , there just are n't any grounds for defense . If another prisoner was threatening him , there were guards he could have asked to help him . Instead , he took the law into his own hands . There is n't a jury in the world that would n't convict him . " " He 's still a fellow human being . Would you just talk to him ? " Jennifer sighed . " I ' 11 talk to him if you want me to , but I wo n't make any commitment . " Father Ryan nodded . " I understand . It would probably mean a great deal of publicity . " They were both thinking the same thing . Abraham Wilson was not the only one who had strikes against him . Sing Sing Prison is situated at the town of Ossining , thirty miles upstate of Manhattan on the east bank of the Hudson78 RAGE OF ANGELS River , overlooking the Tappan Zee and Haverstraw Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant warden and he had made arrangements for her to see Abraham Wilson , who was being held in solitary confine- ment . During the bus ride , Jennifer was filled with a sense of purpose she had not felt in a long time . She was on her way to Sing Sing to meet a possible client charged with murder . This was the kind of case she had studied for , prepared herself for . She felt like a lawyer for the first time in a year , and yet she knew she was being unrealistic . She was not on her way to see a client . She was on her way to tell a man she could not represent him . She could not afford to become involved in a highly publicized case that she had no chance of winning . Abraham Wilson would have to find someone else to defend him . A dilapidated taxi took Jennifer from the bus station to the penitentiary , situated on seventy acres of land near the river . Jennifer rang the bell at the side entrance and a guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list , and directed her to the assistant warden 's office . The assistant warden was a large , square man with an old-fashioned military haircut and an acne-pitted face . His name was Howard Patterson . " I would appreciate anything you can tell me about Abraham Wilson , " Jennifer began . " If you 're looking for comfort , you 're not going to get it here . " Patterson glanced at the dossier on the desk in front of him . " Wilson 's been in and out of prisons all his life . He was caught stealing cars when he was eleven , arrested on a mugging charge when he was thirteen , picked up for rape when he was fifteen , became a pimp at eighteen , served a sentence for putting one of his girls in the hospital . .. " SIDNEY SHELDON 79He leafed through the dossier . " You name it  --  stabbings , armed robbery and finally the big time  --  murder . " It was a depressing recital . Jennifer asked , " Is there any chance that Abraham Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilson 's the first to admit it , but it would n't make any difference even if he denied it . We 've got a hundred and twenty witnesses . " " May I see Mr. Wilson ? " Howard Patterson rose to his feet . " Sure , but you 're wasting your time . " Abraham Wilson was the ugliest human being Jennifer Parker had ever seen . He was coal-black , with a nose that had been broken in several places , missing front teeth and tiny , shifty eyes set in a knife-scarred face . He was about six feet four inches and powerfully built . He had huge flat feet which made him lumber . If Jennifer had searched for ' 1 one word to describe Abraham Wilson , it would have been menacing . She could imagine the effect this man would have on a jury . Abraham Wilson and Jennifer were seated in a highsecurityvisiting room , a thick wire mesh between them , a guard standing at the door .

Merely sitting opposite him she could feel the hatred spewing out of the man . Jennifer opened the conversation by saying , " My name is Jennifer Parker . I 'm an attorney . Father Ryan asked me to see you . " Abraham Wilson spat through the screen , spraying Jenniferwith saliva . " That mothafuckin ' do-gooder . " It 's a wonderful beginning , Jennifer thought . She carefully80 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 81refrained from wiping the saliva from her face . " Is there anything you need here , Mr. Wilson ? " He gave her a toothless smile . " A piece of ass , baby . You innersted ? " She ignored that . " Do you want to tell me what hap-pened ? " " Hey , you lookin ' for my life story , you got ta pay me for it .

" He stared into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering what it must be like to wear that scarred black skin . She wondered how many scars were hidden inside the man . The two of them sat there in a long silence . Finally , Abraham Wilson said , " I killed the somabitch . " " Why did you kill him ? " He shrugged . " The motha ' was comin ' at me with this great big butcher knife , and  --  " " Do n't con me . Prisoners do n't walk around carrying butcher knives . " Wilson 's face tightened and he said , " Get the fuck outa here , lady . I di n't sen ' for ya . " He rose to his feet . " An ' do n't come round heah botherin ' me no more , you heah ? I 'm a busy man . " He turned and walked over to the guard . A moment later they were both gone . That was that . Jennifer could at least tell Father Ryan that she had talked to the man . There was nothing further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building . She started across the courtyard toward the main gate , thinking about Abraham Wilson and her reaction to him . She disliked the man and ; because of that , she was doing something she had no right to do : She was judging him . She had already pronounced him guilty and he had not yet had a trial . Perhaps someone had attacked him , not with a knife , of course , but with a rock or a brick . Jennifer stopped and stood there indecisively . Every instinct told her to go back to Manhattan and forget about Abraham Wilson . Jennifer turned and walked back to the assistant warden 's office . " He 's a hard case , " Howard Patterson said . " When we can , we try rehabilitation instead of punishment , but Abraham Wilson 's too far gone . The only thing that will calm him down is the electric chair . " What a weird piece of logic , Jennifer thought . " He told me the man he killed attacked him with a butcher knife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled her . " What do you mean , that 's possible ' ? Are you saying a convict in here could get possession of a knife ? A butcher knife ? " Howard Patterson shrugged . " Miss Parker , we have twelve82 RAGE OF ANGELShundred and forty convicts in this place , and some of them are men of great ingenuity . Come on . I 'll show you some-thing . " Patterson led Jennifer down a long corridor to a locked door . He selected a key from a large key ring , opened the door and turned on the light . Jennifer followed him into a small , bare room with built-in shelves . " This is where we keep the prisoners ' box of goodies . " He walked over to a large box and lifted the lid . Jennifer stared down into the box unbelievingly . She looked up at Howard Patterson and said , " I want to see my client again . " 6Jennifer prepared for Abraham Wilson 's trial as she had never prepared for anything before in her life . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defenses , and with her client , drawing from him every scrap of information she could . It was no easy task . From the beginning , Wilson was truculent and sarcastic . " You wan na know about me , honey ? I got my first fuck when I was ten . How ole was you ? " Jennifer forced herself to ignore his hatred and his contempt , for she was aware that they covered up a deep fear . And so Jennifer persisted , demanding to know what Wilson 's early life was like , what his parents were like , what had shaped the boy into the man . Over a period of weeks , Abraham Wilson 's reluctance gave way to interest , and his interest finally gave way to fascination . He had never before had reason to think of himself in terms of what kind of person he was , or why . Jennifer 's prodding questions began to arouse memories , 8384 RAGE OF ANGELS some merely unpleasant , others unbearably painful . Several times during the sessions when Jennifer was questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him savage beatings , Wilson would order Jennifer to leave him alone . She left , but she always returned . If Jennifer had had little personal life before , she now had none . When she was not with Abraham Wilson , she was at her office , seven days a week , from early morning until long after midnight , reading everything she could find about the crimes of murder and manslaughter , voluntary and in- voluntary . She studied hundreds of appellate court de- cisions , briefs , affidavits , exhibits , motions , transcripts . She pored over files on intent and premeditation , self-defense , double jeopardy , and temporary insanity . She studied ways to get the charge reduced to manslaugh- ter . Abraham had not planned to kill the man . But would a jury believe that ? Particularly a local jury . The townspeople hated the prisoners in their midst . Jennifer moved for a change of venue , and it was granted . The trial would be held in Manhattan . Jennifer had an important decision to make : Should she allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if the jurors were able to hear his side of the story from his own lips , they might have some sympathy for him . The problem was that putting Abraham Wilson on the stand would allow the prosecution to reveal Wilson 's back- ground and past record , including the previous murder he had committed . Jennifer wondered which one of the assistant district at- torneys Di Silva would assign to be her adversary . There were half a dozen very good ones who prosecuted murder trials , and Jennifer familiarized herself with their techniques . She spent as much time as possible at Sing Sing , looking over the scene of the killing in the recreation yard , talking to guards and Abraham , and she interviewed dozens of convictswho had witnessed the killing . " Raymond Thorpe attacked Abraham Wilson with a knife , " Jennifer said . " A large butcher knife . You must have seen it . " " Me ? I did n't see no knife . " " You must have . You were right there . " " Lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was willing to get involved . Occasionally Jennifer would take time out to have a regular meal , but usually she grabbed a quick sandwich at the coffee shop on the main floor of the courthouse . She was beginning to lose weight and she had dizzy spells . Ken Bailey was becoming concerned about her . He took her to Forlini 's across from the courthouse , and ordered a large lunch for her . " Are you trying to kill yourself ? " he demanded . " Of course not . " " Have you looked in a mirror lately ? " " No . " He studied her and said , " If you have any sense , you 'll drop this case . " " Why ? " " Because you 're setting yourself up as a clay pigeon . Jennifer , I hear things on the street . The press is peeing in its collective pants , they 're so eager to start taking potshots at you again . " " I 'm an attorney , " Jennifer said stubbornly . " Abraham Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to see that he gets one . " She saw the look of concern on Ken Bailey 's face . " Do n't worry about it . The case is n't going to get that much publicity . " " It is n't , huh ? Do you know who 's prosecuting ? " " No . " " Robert Di Silva . " 86 RAGE OF ANGELS * * * Jennifer arrived at the Leonard Street entrance of the Criminal Courts Building and pushed her way past the people churning through the lobby , past the uniformed policemen , the detectives dressed like hippies , the lawyers identified by the briefcases they carried . Jennifer walked toward the large circular information desk , where no attendant had ever been posted , and took the elevator to the sixth floor . She was on her way to see the District Attorney . It had been almost a year since her last encounter with Robert Di Silva , and Jennifer was not looking forward to this one . She was going to inform him that she was resigning from Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights to make her decision . What it came down to finally was that the primary consideration had to be the best interests of her client . The Wilson case was not important enough for Di Silva to handle himself . The only reason , therefore , for the District Attorney 's giving it his personal attention was because of Jennifer 's in- volvement . Di Silva wanted vengeance . He was planning to teach Jennifer a lesson . And so she had finally decided she had no choice but to withdraw from Wilson 's defense . She could not let him be executed because of a mistake she had once made . With her off the case , Robert Di Silva would probably deal with Wilson more leniently . Jennifer was on her way to save Abraham Wilson 's life . There was an odd feeling of reliving the past as she got off at the sixth floor and walked toward the familiar door marked District Attorney , County of New York . Inside , the same secretary was seated at the same desk . " I 'm Jennifer Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in , " the secretary said . " The District Attorney is expecting you . " Robert Di Silva was standing behind his desk , chewing on a wet cigar , giving orders to two assistants . He stopped as Jennifer entered . " I was betting you would n't show up . " " I 'm here . " " I thought you would have turned tail and run out of town by now . What do you want ? " There were two chairs opposite Robert Di Silva 's desk , but he did not invite Jennifer to sit . " I came here to talk about my client , Abraham Wilson . " Robert Di Silva sat down , leaned back in his chair and pretended to think . " Abraham Wilson . . . oh , yes . That 's the nigger murderer who beat a man to death in prison . You should n't have any trouble defending him . " He glanced at his two assistants and they left the room . " Well , counselor ? " " I 'd like to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with exaggerated surprise . " You mean you came in to make a deal ? You amaze me . I would have thought that someone with your great legal talent would be able to get him off scot-free . " " Mr. Di Silva , I know this looks like an open-and-shut case , " Jennifer began , " but there are extenuating circumstances . Abraham Wilson was  --  " District Attorney Di Silva interrupted . " Let me put it in legal language you can understand , counselor . You can take your extenuating circumstances and shove them up your ass ! " He got to his feet and when he spoke his voice was trembling with rage . " Make a deal with you , lady ? You fucked up my life ! There 's a dead body and your boy 's going to burn for it . Do you hear me ? I 'm making it my personal business to see that he 's sent to the chair . " " I came up here to withdraw from the case . You could reduce this to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could  --  " " No way ! He 's guilty of murder plain and simple ! " 88 RAGE OF ANGELSJennifer tried to control her anger . " I thought the jury was supposed to decide that . " Robert Di Silva smiled at her without mirth . " You do n't know how heartwarming it is to have an expert like you walk into my office and explain the law to me . " " Ca n't we forget our personal problems ? I  --  " " Not as long as I live . Say hello to your pal Michael Moretti for me . " Half an hour later , Jennifer was having coffee with Ken Bailey . " I do n't know what to do , " Jennifer confessed . " I thought if I got off the case Abraham Wilson would stand a better chance . But Di Silva wo n't make a deal . He 's not after Wilson  --  he 's after me . " Ken Bailey looked at her thoughtfully . " Maybe he 's trying to psych you out . He wants you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She took a sip of her coffee . It tasted bitter . " It 's a bad case . You should see Abraham Wilson . All the jury will have to do is look at him and they 'll vote to convict . " " When does the trial come up ? " " In four weeks . " " Anything I can do to help ? " " Uh-huh . Put out a contract on Di Silva . " " Do you think there 's any chance you can get Wilson an acquittal ? " " Looking at it from the pessimist 's point of view , I 'm trying my first case against the smartest District Attorney in the country , who has a vendetta against me , and my client is a convicted Black killer who killed again in front of a hundred and twenty witnesses . " " Terrific . What 's the optimist 's point of view ? " " I could get hit by a truck this afternoon . " The trial date was only three weeks away now . Jennifer arranged for Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . He was put in the House of Detention for Men , the largest and oldest jail on the island . Ninety-five percent of his prison mates were there awaiting trial for felonies : murder , arson , rape , armed robbery and sodomy . No private cars were allowed on the island , and Jennifer was transported in a small green bus to the gray brick control building where she showed her identification . There were two armed guards in a green booth to the left of the building , and beyond that a gate where all unauthorized visitors were stopped . From the control building , Jennifer was driven down Hazen Street , the little road that went through the prison grounds , to the Anna M. Kross Center Building , where Abraham Wilson was brought to see her in the counsel room , with its eight cubicles reserved for attorney-client meetings . Walking down the long corridor on her way to meet with Abraham Wilson , Jennifer thought : This must be like the waiting room to hell . There was an incredible cacophony . The prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steel gates were constantly opening and clanging shut . There were more than one hundred men in each cellblock , talking and yelling at the same time , with two television sets tuned to different channels and a music system playing country rock . Three hundred guards were assigned to the building , and their bellowing could be heard over the prison symphony . A guard had told Jennifer , " Prison society is the politest society in the world . If a prisoner ever brushes up against another one , he immediately says , Excuse me . ' Prisoners have a lot on their minds and the least little thing . . . " Jennifer sat across from Abraham Wilson and she thought : 90 RAGE OF ANGELSThis man 's life is in my hands . If he dies , it will be because I failed him . She looked into his eyes and saw the despair there . " I 'm going to do everything I can , " Jennifer promised . Three days before the Abraham Wilson trial was to begin , Jennifer learned that the presiding judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presided over the Michael Moretti trial and had tried to get Jennifer disbarred. 7At four o'clock on a Monday morning in late September of 1970 , the day the trial of Abraham Wilson was to begin , Jennifer awakened feeling tired and heavy-eyed . She had slept badly , her mind filled with dreams of the trial . In one of the dreams , Robert Di Silva had put her in the witness box and asked her about Michael Moretti . Each time Jennifer tried to answer the questions , the jurors interrupted her with a chant : Liar ! Liar ! Liar ! Each dream was different , but they were all similar . In the last one , Abraham Wilson was strapped in the electric chair . As Jennifer leaned over to console him , he spit in her face . Jennifer awoke trembling , and it was impossible for her to ( j ! go back to sleep . She sat up in a chair until dawn and watched the sun come up . She was too nervous to eat . She wished she could have slept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense . She wished that this day was over . As she bathed and dressed she had a premonition of doom 9192 RAGE OF ANGELS She felt like wearing black , but she chose a green Chanel copy she had bought on sale at Loehmann 's . At eight-thirty , Jennifer Parker arrived at the Criminal Courts Building to begin the defense in the case of The People of the State of New York against Abraham Wilson . There was a crowd outside the entrance and Jennifer 's first thought was that there had been an accident . She saw a bat- tery of television cameras and microphones , and before Jen- nifer realized what was happening , she was surrounded by reporters . A reporter said , " Miss Parker , this is your first time in court , is n't it , since you fouled up the Michael Moretti case for the District Attorney ? " Ken Bailey had warned her . She was the central attraction , not her client . The reporters were not there as objective ob servers ; they were there as birds of prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in jeans pushed a microphone up to Jen- nifer 's face . " Is it true that District Attorney Di Silva is out to get you ? " " No comment . " Jennifer began to fight her way toward the entrance of the building . " The District Attorney issued a statement last night that he thinks you should n't be allowed to practice law in the New York courts . Would you like to say anything about that ? " " No comment . " Jennifer had almost reached the entrance . " Last year Judge Waldman tried to get you disbarred . Are you going to ask him to disqualify himself from  --  ? " Jennifer was inside the courthouse . The trial was scheduled to take place in Room 37 . The corridor outside was crowded with people trying to get in , but the courtroom was already full . It was buzzing with noise and there was a carnival atmosphere in the air . There were extra rows reserved for members of the press . Di Silva saw to that , Jennifer thought . Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone around him like an evil mountain . He was dressed in a dark blue suit that was too small for him , and a white shirt and blue tie that Jennifer had bought him . They did not help . Abraham Wilson looked like an ugly killer in a dark blue suit . He might just as well have worn his prison clothes , Jennifer thought , discouraged . Wilson was staring defiantly around the courtroom , gloweringat everyone who met his look . Jennifer knew her client well enough now to understand that his belligerence was qtt , cover-up for his fright ; but what would come over to everyone ,  --  including the judge and the jury  --  was an impression of hostility and hatred . The huge man was a threat . They would regard him as someone to be feared , to be destroyed . There was not a trace in Abraham Wilson 's personality that was loveable . There was nothing about his appearance that could evoke sympathy . There was only that ugly , scarred face with its broken nose and missing teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the defense table where Abraham Wilson was sitting and took the seat next to him . " Good morning , Abraham . " He glanced over at her and said , " I did n't think you was comin ' . " Jennifer remembered her dream . She looked into his small , slitted eyes . " You knew I 'd be here . " He shrugged indifferently . " It do n't matter one way or another . They 's gon na get me , baby . They 's gon na convict me of murder and then they 's gon na pass a law makin ' it legal to boil me in oil , then they 's gon na boil me in oil . This ai n't gon na be no trial . This is gon na be a show . I hope you brung your popcorn. " 94 RAGE OF ANGELS There was a stir around the prosecutor 's table and Jennifer looked up to see District Attorney Di Silva taking his place at the table next to a battery of assistants . He looked at Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A court officer said , " All rise , " and Judge Lawrence Wald- man entered from the judge 's robing room . " Hear ye , Hear ye . All people having business with Part Thirty-seven of this Court , draw near , give your attention and you shall be heard . The Honorable Justice Lawrence Wald- man presiding . " The only one who refused to stand was Abraham Wilson . Jennifer whispered out of the corner of her mouth , " Stand up ! " " Fuck ' em , baby . They gon na have to come and drag me up . " Jennifer took his giant hand in hers . " On your feet , Abra- ham . We 're going to beat them . " He looked at her for a long moment , then slowly got to his feet , towering over her . Judge Waldman took his place on the bench . The specta- tors resumed their seats . The court clerk handed a court cal- endar to the judge . " The People of the State of New York versus Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jennifer 's instinct normally would have been to fill the jury box with Blacks , but because of Abraham Wilson she was not so sure . Wilson was not one of them . He was a renegade , a killer , " a disgrace to their race . " They might convict him more readily than would whites . All Jennifer could do was try to keep the more obvious bigots off the jury . But bigots did not go around advertising . They would keep quiet about their prejudices , waiting to get their vengeance . By late afternoon of the second day , Jennifer had used up her ten peremptory challenges . She felt that her voir dire  --  the questioning of the jurors  --  was clumsy and awkward , while Di Silva 's was smooth and skillful . He had the knack of putting the jurors at ease , drawing them into his confidence , making friends of them . How could I have forgotten what a good actor Di Silva is ? Jennifer wondered . Di Silva did not exercise his peremptory challenges until Jennifer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she discovered the reason , it was too late . Di Silva had outsmarted her . Among the final prospective jurors questionedwere a private detective , a bank manager and the mother of a doctor  --  all of them Establishment  --  and there was nothing now that Jennifer could do to keep them off the jury . The District Attorney had sandbagged her . Robert Di Silva rose to his feet and began his opening statement . " If it please the court "  --  he turned to the jury  --  " and you ladies and gentlemen of the jury , first of all I would like to thank you for giving up your valuable time to sit in this case . " He smiled sympathetically . " I know what a disruption jury service can be . You all have jobs to get back to , families needingyour attention . " It 's as though he 's one of them , Jennifer thought , the thirteenthjuror . " I promise to take up as little of your time as possible . This is really a very simple case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defendant is accused by the State of New York of murdering a fellow inmate at Sing Sing Prison , Raymond Thorpe . There 's no doubt that he did . He 's admitted it . Mr. Wilson 's attorney is going to plead self-defense . " The District Attorney turned to look at the huge figure of Abraham Wilson , and the eyes of the jurors automatically96 RAGE OF ANGELSfollowed him . Jennifer could see the reactions on their faces . She forced herself to concentrate on what District Attorney Di Silva was saying . " A number of years ago twelve citizens , very much like yourselves , I am sure , voted to put Abraham Wilson away in a penitentiary . Because of certain legal technicalities , I am not permitted to discuss with you the crime that Abraham Wilson committed . I can tell you that that jury sincerely be- lieved that locking Abraham Wilson up would prevent him from committing any further crimes . Tragically , they were wrong . For even locked away , Abraham Wilson was able to strike , to kill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , finally , that there is only one way to prevent Abraham Wilson from killing again . And that is to execute him . It wo n't bring back the life of Raymond Thorpe , but it can save the lives of other men who might otherwise become the defendant 's next victims . " Di Silva walked along the jury box , looking each juror in the eye . " I told you that this case wo n't take up much of your time . I 'll tell you why I said that . The defendant sitting over there  --  Abraham Wilson  --  murdered a man in cold blood . He has confessed to the killing . But even if he had not confessed , we have witnesses who saw Abraham Wilson commit that murder in cold blood . More than a hundred witnesses , in fact . " Let us examine the phrase , in cold blood . ' Murder for any reason is as distasteful to me as I know it is to you . But some- times murders are committed for reasons we can at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threaten- ing your loved one  --  a child , or a husband or a wife . Well , if you had a gun you might pull that trigger in order to save your loved one 's life . You and I might not condone that kind of thing , but I 'm sure we can at least understand it . Or , let 's take another example . If you were suddenly awakened in the middle of the night by an intruder threatening your life and you had a chance to kill him to save yourself , and you killedSIDNEY SHELDON 97him  --  well , I think we can all understand how that might happen . And that would n't make us desperate criminals or evil people , would it ? It was something we did in the heat of the moment . " Di Silva 's voice hardened . " But cold-blooded murder is something else again . To take the life of another human being , without the excuse of any feelings or passions , to do it for money or drugs or the sheer pleasure of killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not oversteppingthe bounds , so that there could be no error calling for mistrial or reversal . Jennifer watched the faces of the jurors , and there was no question but that Robert Di Silva had them . They were agreeingwith every word he said . They shook their heads and nodded and frowned . They did everything but applaud him . He was an orchestra leader and the jury was his orchestra . Jennifer had never seen anything like it . Every time the DistrictAttorney mentioned Abraham Wilson 's name  --  and he mentioned it with almost every sentence  --  the jury automaticallylooked over at the defendant . Jennifer had cautioned Wilson not to look at the jury . She had drilled it into him over and over again that he was to look anywhere in the courtroom except at the jury box , because the air of defiance he exuded was enraging . To her horror now , Jennifer found that AbrahamWilson 's eyes were fastened on the jury box , locking eyes with the jurors . Aggression seemed to be pouring out of him . Jennifer said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not turn . The District Attorney was finishing his opening address . " The Bible says , An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . ' That is vengeance . The State is not asking for vengeance . It is asking for justice . Justice for the poor man whom Abraham Wilsoncold-bloodedly  --  cold-bloodedly  --  murdered . Thank you . " The District Attorney took his seat . As Jennifer rose to address the jury , she could feel their hostility and impatience . She had read books about how law-98 RAGE OF ANGELS yers were able to read juries ' minds , and she had been skep- tical . But no longer . The message from the jury was coming at her loudly and clearly . They had already decided her client was guilty , and they were impatient because Jennifer was wasting their time , keeping them in court when they could be out doing more important things , as their friend the District Attorney had pointed out . Jennifer and Abraham Wilson were the enemy . Jennifer took a deep breath and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned back to the jurors . " Ladies and gentlemen , the reason we have courtrooms , the reason we are all here today , is because the law , in its wisdom , knows that there are always two sides to every case . Listening to the Dis- trict Attorney 's attack on my client , listening to him pro- nounce my client guilty without benefit of a jury 's verdict  --  your verdict  --  one would not think so . " She looked into their faces for a sign of sympathy or sup- port . There was none . She forced herself to go on . " District Attorney Di Silva used the phrase over and over , Abraham Wilson is guilty . ' That is a lie . Judge Waldman will tell you that no defendant is guilty until a judge or jury declares that he is guilty . That is what we are all here to find out , is n't it ? Abraham Wilson has been charged with murdering a fellow inmate at Sing Sing . But Abraham Wilson did not kill for money or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You re- member those clever examples that the District Attorney gave you when he explained the difference between killing in cold blood and in hot blood . Killing in hot blood is when you 're protecting someone you love , or when you 're defending your- self . Abraham Wilson killed in self-defense , and I tell you now that any of us in this courtroom , under identical circum- stances , would have done exactly the same thing . " The District Attorney and I agree on one point : Every man has the right to protect his own life . If Abraham Wilson had not acted exactly as he did , he would be dead . " Jennifer 's voice was ringing with sincerity . She had forgotten her nervousnessin the passion of her conviction . " I ask each of you to remember one thing : Under the law of this state , the prosecutionmust prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the act of killing was not committed in self-defense . And before this trial is over we will present solid evidence to show you that Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you . " The parade of witnesses for the State began . Robert Di Silva had not missed a single opportunity . His character witnessesfor the deceased , Raymond Thorpe , included a minister , prison guards and fellow convicts . One by one they took the stand and testified to the sterling character and pacific disposition of the deceased . Each time the District Attorney was finished with a witness , he turned to Jennifer and said , " Your witness . " And each time Jennifer replied , " No cross-examination . " She knew that there was no point in trying to discredit the character witnesses . By the time they were finished , one would have thought that Raymond Thorpe had been wrongfully deprived of sainthood . The guards , who had been carefully coached by Robert Di Silva , testified that Thorpe had been a model prisoner who went around Sing Sing doing good works , intent only on helping his fellow man . The fact that Raymond Thorpe was a convicted bank robber and rapist was a tiny flaw in an otherwise perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the physical description of Raymond Thorpe . He had been a slightly built man , only five feet nine inches tall . Robert Di Silva dwelt on that , and he never let the jurors forget it . He painted a graphic picture of how Abraham Wilson had viciouslyattacked the smaller man and had smashed Thorpe 's head against a concrete building in the exercise yard , instantly killing him . As Di Silva spoke , the jurors ' eyes were fastened100 RAGE OF ANGELS I SIDNEY SHELDON 101on the giant figure of the defendant sitting at the table , dwarfing everyone near him . The District Attorney was saying , " We 'll probably never know what caused Abraham Wilson to attack this harmless , defenseless little man  --  " And Jennifer 's heart suddenly leaped . One word that Di Silva had said had given her the chance she needed. "  --  We may never know the reason for the defendant 's viciousattack , but one thing we do know , ladies and gentlemen  --  it was n't because the murdered man was a threat to Abraham Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your Honor , would you please direct the defendant to rise ? " Judge Waldman looked at Jennifer . " Does counsel for the defense have any objection ? " Jennifer had an idea what was coming , but she knew that any objection on her part could only be damaging . " No , Your Honor . " Judge Waldman said , " Will the defendant rise , please ? " Abraham Wilson sat there a moment , his face defiant ; then he slowly rose to his full height of six feet four inches . Di Silva said , " There is a court clerk here , Mr. Galin , who is five feet nine inches tall , the exact height of the murdered man , Raymond Thorpe . Mr. Galin , would you please go over and stand next to the defendant ? " The court clerk walked over to Abraham Wilson and stood next to him . The contrast between the two men was ludicrous . Jennifer knew she had been outmaneuvered again , but there was nothing she could do about it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there looking at the two men for a moment , and then said to the jury , his voice almost a whisper , " Self-defense ? " The trial was going worse than Jennifer had dreamed inher wildest nightmares . She could feel the jury 's eagerness to get the trial over with so they could deliver a verdict of guilty . Ken Bailey was seated among the spectators and , during a recess , Jennifer had a chance to exchange a few words with him . " It 's not an easy case , " Ken said sympathetically . " I wish you did n't have King Kong for a client . Christ , just looking at him is enough to scare the hell out of anybody . " " He ca n't help that . " " As the old joke goes , he could have stayed home . How are you and our esteemed District Attorney getting along ? " Jennifer gave him a mirthless smile . " Mr. Di Silva sent me a message this morning . He intends to remove me from the law business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Di Silva had rested his case , Jennifer rose and said , " I would like to call Howard Patterson to the stand . " The assistant warden of Sing Sing Prison reluctantly rose and moved toward the witness box , all eyes fixed on him . Robert Di Silva watched intently as Patterson took the oath . Di Silva 's mind was racing , computing all the probabilities . He knew he had won the case . He had his victory speech all prepared . Jennifer was addressing the witness . " Would you fill the jury in on your background , please , Mr. Patterson ? " District Attorney Di Silva was on his feet . " The State will waive the witness 's background in order to save time , and we will stipulate that Mr. Patterson is the assistant warden at Sing Sing Prison . " " Thank you , " Jennifer said . " I think the jury should be informedthat Mr. Patterson had to be subpoenaed to come here today . He is here as a hostile witness . " Jennifer turned to Patterson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify on behalf of my client , you refused . Is that true ? " 102 RAGE OF ANGELS " Yes . " " Would you tell the jury why you had to be subpoenaed to get you here ? " " I 'll be glad to . I 've been dealing with men like Abraham Wilson all my life . They 're born troublemakers . " Robert Di Silva was leaning forward in his chair , grinning , his eyes locked on the faces of the jurors . He whispered to an assistant , " Watch her hang herself . " Jennifer said , " Mr. Patterson , Abraham Wilson is not on trial here for being a troublemaker . He 's on trial for his life . Would n't you be willing to help a fellow human being who was unjustly accused of a capital crime ? " " If he were unjustly accused , yes . " The emphasis on unjustlybrought a knowing look to the faces of the jurors . " There have been killings in prison before this case , havethere not ? " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial environment , they 're bound to generate an enormous amount of hostility , and there 's  --  " " Just yes or no , please , Mr. Patterson . " " Yes . " " Of those killings that have occurred in your experience , would you say that there have been a variety of motives ? " " Well , I suppose so . Sometimes  --  " " Yes or no , please . " " Yes . " " Has self-defense ever been a motive in any of those prison killings ? " " Well , sometimes  --  " He saw the expression on Jennifer 's face . " Yes . " " So , based on your vast experience , it is entirely possible , is it not , that Abraham Wilson was actually defending his own life when he killed Raymond Thorpe ? " " I do n't think it  --  " " I asked if it is possible . Yes or no . " SIDNEY SHELDON 103 " It is highly unlikely , " Patterson said stubbornly . Jennifer turned to Judge Waldman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question ? " Judge Waldman looked down at Howard Patterson . " The witness will answer the question . " " Yes . " But the fact that his whole attitude said no had registered on the jury . Jennifer said , " If the court please , I have subpoenaed from the witness some material I would like to submit now in evidence . " District Attorney Di Silva rose . " What kind of material ? " " Evidence that will prove our contention of self-defense . " " Objection , Your Honor . " " What are you objecting to ? " Jennifer asked . " You have n't seen it yet . " Judge Waldman said , " The court will withhold a ruling until it sees the evidence . A man 's life is at stake here . The defendant is entitled to every possible consideration . " " Thank you , Your Honor . " Jennifer turned to Howard Patterson . " Did you bring it with you ? " she asked . He nodded , tight-lipped . " Yes . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've already made that very clear , Mr. Patterson . May we have it , please ? " Howard Patterson looked over to the spectator area where a man in a prison guard uniform was seated . Patterson nodded to him . The guard rose and came forward , carrying a covered wooden box . Jennifer took it from him . " The defense would like to place this in evidence as Exhibit A , Your Honor . " " What is it ? " District Attorney Di Silva demanded . " It 's called a goodie box . " There was a titter from the spectators . Judge Waldman looked down at Jennifer and said slowly , 104 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 105 " Did you say a goodie box ? What is in the box , Miss Parker ? " " Weapons . Weapons that were made in Sing Sing by the prisoners for the purpose of  --  " " Objection ! " The District Attorney was on his feet , his voice a roar . He hurried toward the bench . " I 'm willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if she intends to practice criminal law , then I would suggest she study the basic rules of evidence . There is no evidence linking anything in this so-called goodie box with the case that is being tried in this court . " " This box proves  --  " " This box proves nothing . " The District Attorney 's voice was withering . He turned to Judge Waldman . " The State objectsto the introduction of this exhibit as being immaterial and irrelevant . " " Objection sustained . " And Jennifer stood there , watching her case collapse . Everything was against her : the judge , the jury , Di Silva , the evidence . Her client was going to the electric chair unless .. Jennifer took a deep breath . " Your Honor , this exhibit is absolutely vital to our defense . I feel  --  " Judge Waldman interrupted . " Miss Parker , this court does not have the time or the inclination to give you instructions in the law , but the District Attorney is quite right . Before coming into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . The first rule is that you can not introduce evidence that has not been properly prepared for . Nothing has been put into the record about the deceased being armed or not armed . Therefore , the question of these weapons becomes extraneous . You are overruled . " Jennifer stood there , the blood rushing to her cheeks . " I 'm sorry , " she said stubbornly , " but it is not extraneous . " " That is enough ! You may file an exception . " " I do n't want to file an exception , Your Honor . You 're denying my client his rights . " " Miss Parker , if you go any further I will hold you in contempt of court . " " I do n't care what you do to me , " Jennifer said . " The ground has been prepared for introducing this evidence . The District Attorney prepared it himself . " Di Silva said , " What ? I never  --  " Jennifer turned to the court stenographer . " Would you please read Mr. Di Silva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably never know what caused Abraham Wilson to attack . . . ' ? " The District Attorney looked up at Judge Waldman . " Your Honor , are you going to allow  --  ? " Judge Waldman held up a hand . He turned to Jennifer . " This court does not need you to explain the law to it , Miss Parker . When this trial is ended , you will be held in contempt of court . Because this is a capital case , I am going to hear you out . " He turned to the court stenographer . " You may pro-ceed . " The court stenographer turned some pages and began reading . " We 'll probably never know what caused Abraham Wilsonto attack this harmless , defenseless little man  --  " " That 's enough , " Jennifer interrupted . " Thank you . " She looked at Robert Di Silva and said slowly , " Those are your words , Mr. Di Silva . We 'll probably never know what caused Abraham Wilson to attack this harmless , defenseless little man . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key word , Your Honor , is defenseless . Since the District Attorney himself told this jury that the victim was defenseless , he left an open door for us to pursue the fact that the victim might not have been defenseless , that he might , in fact , have had a weapon . Whatever is brought up in the direct is admissible in the cross . " There was a long silence. 106 RAGE OF ANGELS Judge Waldman turned to Robert Di Silva . " Miss Parker has a valid point . You did leave the door open . " Robert Di Silva was looking at him unbelievingly . " But I only  --  " " The court will allow the evidence to be entered as Exhibit A. " Jennifer took a deep , grateful breath . " Thank you , Your Honor . " She picked up the covered box , held it up in her hands and turned to face the jury . " Ladies and gentlemen , in his final summation the District Attorney is going to tell you that what you are about to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be correct . He is going to tell you that there is nothing to link any of these weapons to the deceased . He will be correct . I am introducing this exhibit for another reason . For days now , you have been hearing how the ruthless , trouble-making defendant , who stands six feet four inches tall , wantonly attacked Raymond Thorpe , who stood only five feet nine inches tall . The picture that has been so carefully , and falsely , painted for you by the prosecution is that of a sadistic , murdering bully who killed another inmate for no reason . But ask yourselves this : Is n't there always some motive ? Greed , hate , lust , something ? I believe  --  and I 'm staking my client 's life on that belief  --  that there was a motive for that killing . The only motive , as the District Attorney himself told you , that justifies killing someone : self-defense . A man fighting to protect his own life . You have heard Howard Patterson testify that in his experience murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . What that means is that it was possible that Raymond Thorpe was armed with such a weapon , that indeed it was he who was attacking the de- fendant , and the defendant , trying to protect himself , was forced to kill him  --  in self-defense . If you decide that Abra- ham Wilson ruthlessly  --  and without any motivation at all  --  killed Raymond Thorpe , then you must bring in a verdict of guilty as charged . If , however , after seeing this evidence , you have a reasonable doubt in your minds , then it is your duty to return a verdict of not guilty . " The covered box was becoming heavy in her hands . " When I first looked into this box I could not believe what I saw . You , too , may find it hard to believebutI ask you to remember that it was brought here under protestby the assistant warden of Sing Sing Prison . This , ladies and gentlemen , is a collection of confiscated weapons secretly made by the convicts at Sing Sing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stumble and lose her balance . The box fell out of her grasp , the top flew off , and the contents spilled out over the courtroomfloor . There was a gasp . The jurors began to get to their feet so they could have a better look . They were staring at the hideous collection of weapons that had tumbled from the box . There were almost one hundred of them , of every size , shape and description . Homemade hatchets and butcher knives , stilettos and deadly looking scissors with the ends honed , pellet guns , and a large , vicious-looking cleaver . There were thin wires with wooden handles , used for strangling , a leather sap , a sharpened ice pick , a machete . Spectators and reporters were on their feet now , craning to get a better look at the arsenal that lay scattered on the floor . Judge Waldman was angrily pounding his gavel for order . Judge Waldman looked at Jennifer with an expression she could not fathom . A bailiff hurried forward to pick up the spilled contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she said , " I 'll do it . " As the jurors and spectators watched , Jennifer got down on her knees and began picking up the weapons and putting them back in the box . She worked slowly , handling the weaponsgingerly , looking at each one without expression before she replaced it . The jurors had taken their seats again , but they were watching every move she made . It took Jennifer a full five minutes to return the weapons to the box , while District Attorney Di Silva sat there , fuming. 108 RAGE OF ANGELSWhen Jennifer had put the last weapon in the deadly arsenal back in the box , she rose , looked at Patterson , then turned and said to Di Silva , " Your witness . " It was too late to repair the damage that had been done . " No cross , " the District Attorney said . " Then I would like to call Abraham Wilson to the stand . " 8 " Your name ? " " Abraham Wilson . " " Would you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wilson , did you kill Raymond Thorpe ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Would you tell the court why ? " " He was gon na kill me . " " Raymond Thorpe was a much smaller man than you . Did you really believe that he would be able to kill you ? " " He was comin ' at me with a knife that made him purty tall . " Jennifer had kept out two objects from the goodie box . One was a finely honed butcher knife ; the other was a large pair of metal tongs . She held up the knife . " Was this the knife that Raymond Thorpe threatened you with ? " " Objection ! The defendant has no way of knowing  --  " 109110 RAGE OF ANGELS " I 'll rephrase the question . Was this similar to the knife that Raymond Thorpe threatened you with ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " And these tongs ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Had you had trouble with Thorpe before ?

" Your witness . " Robert Di Silva rose to his feet and moved slowly toward the witness box . " Mr. Wilson , you 've killed before , have n't you ? I mean , this was n't your first murder ? " " I made a mistake and I 'm payin ' for it . I  --  " " Spare us your sermon . Just answer yes or no . " " Yes . " " So a human life does n't have much value to you . " " That ai n't true . I  --  " " Do you call committing two murders valuing human life ? How many people would you have killed if you did n't value human life ? Five ? Ten ? Twenty ? " He was baiting Abraham Wilson and Wilson was falling for it . His jaw was clenched and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only kilt two people . " " Only ! You only killed two people ! " The District Attorney shook his head in mock dismay . He stepped close to the wit- ness box and looked up at the defendant . " I 'll bet it gives you a feeling of power to be so big . It must make you feel a little bit like God . Any time you want to , you can take a life here , take a life there ... " , braham Wilson was on his feet , rising to his full height . " You somabitch ! " No ! Jennifer prayed . Do n't ! " Sit down ! " Di Silva thundered . " Is that the way you lost your temper when you killed Raymond Thorpe ? " " Thorpe was tryin ' ta kill me . " " With these ? " Di Silva held up the butcher knife and the , pair of tongs . " I 'm sure you could have taken that knife away from him . " He waved the tongs around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the jury and held up the tongs deprecatingly . " This does n't look so terribly lethal . If the deceased had been able to hit you over the head with it , it might have caused a small bump . What exactly is this pair of tongs , Mr. Wilson ? " Abraham Wilson said softly , " They 're testicle crushers . " The jury was out for eight hours . Robert Di Silva and his assistants left the courtroom to take a break , but Jennifer stayed in her seat , unable to tear herself away . When the jury filed out of the room , Ken Bailey came up to Jennifer . " How about a cup of coffee ? " " I could n't swallow anything . " She sat in the courtroom , afraid to move , only dimly aware of the people around her . It was over . She had done her best . She closed her eyes and tried to pray , but the fear in her was too strong . She felt as though she , along with Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jury was filing back into the room , their faces grim and foreboding , and Jennifer 's heart began to beat faster . She could see by their faces that they were going to convict . She thought she would faint . Because of her , a man was going to be executed . She should never have taken the case in the112 RAGE OF ANGELSfirst place . What right had she to put a man 's life in her hands ? She must have been insane to think she could win over someoneas experienced as Robert Di Silva . She wanted to run up to the jurors before they could give their verdict and say , Wait ! Abraham Wilson has n't had a fair trial . Please let another attorney defend him . Someone better than I am . But it was too late . Jennifer stole a look at Abraham Wilson'sface . He sat there as immobile as a statue . She could feel no hatred coming from him now , only a deep despair . She wanted to say something to comfort him , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has the jury reached a verdict ? " " It has , Your Honor . " The judge nodded and his clerk walked over to the foreman of the jury , took a slip of paper from him and handed it to the judge . Jennifer felt as though her heart were going to come out of her chest . She could not breathe . She wanted to hold back this moment , to freeze it forever before the verdict was read . Judge Waldman studied the slip of paper in his hands ; then he slowly looked around the courtroom . His eyes rested on the members of the jury , on Robert Di Silva , on Jennifer and finally on Abraham Wilson . " The defendant will please rise . " Abraham Wilson got to his feet , his movements slow andtired , as though all the energy had been drained out of him . Judge Waldman read from the slip of paper . " This juryfinds the defendant , Abraham Wilson , not guilty as charged . " There was a momentary hush and the judge 's further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer stoodthere , stunned , unable to believe what she was hearing . Sheturned toward Abraham Wilson , speechless . He stared at herfor an instant with those small , mean eyes . And then that uglyface broke into the broadest grin that Jennifer had ever seen . He reached down and hugged her and Jennifer tried to fight back her tears . The press was crowding around Jennifer , asking for a statement , barraging her with questions . " How does it feel to beat the District Attorney ? " " Did you think you were going to win this case ? " " What would you have done if they had sent Wilson to theelectric chair ? " Jennifer shook her head to all questions . She could not bring herself to talk to them . They had come here to watch a spectacle , to see a man being hounded to his death . If the verdict had gone the other way . . . she could not bear to think about it . Jennifer began to collect her papers and stuff them into a briefcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you in his chambers , Miss Parker . " She had forgotten that there was a contempt of court citationwaiting for her but it no longer seemed important . The only thing that mattered was that she had saved Abraham Wilson 's life . Jennifer glanced over at the prosecutor 's table . District AttorneySilva was savagely stuffing papers into a briefcase , berating one of his assistants . He caught Jennifer 's look . His eyes met hers and he needed no words . Judge Lawrence Waldman was seated at his desk when Jennifer walked in . He said curtly , " Sit down , Miss Parker . " Jennifer took a seat . " I will not allow you or anyone else to turn my courtroom into a sideshow . " Jennifer flushed . " I tripped . I could n't help what  --  " Judge Waldman raised a hand . " Please . Spare me .

" Jennifer watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAGE OF ANGELSbounds this afternoon . I realize that your excessive zeal was in defense of a man 's life . Because of that , I have decided not to cite you for contempt . " " Thank you , Your Honor . " Jennifer had to force the words out . The judge 's face was unreadable as he continued : " Almost invariably , when a case is finished I have a sense of whether justice has been served or not . In this instance , quite frankly , I 'm not sure . " Jennifer waited for him to go on . " That 's all , Miss Parker . " In the evening editions of the newspapers and on the televisionnews that night , Jennifer Parker was back in the headlines , but this time she was the heroine . She was the legal David who had slain Goliath . Pictures of her and Abraham Wilson and District Attorney Di Silva were plastered all over the front pages . Jennifer hungrily devoured every word of the stories , savoring them . It was such a sweet victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey took her to dinner at Luchow 's to celebrate , and Jennifer was recognized by the captain and several of the customers . Strangers called Jennifer by name and congratulatedher . It was a heady experience . " How does it feel to be a celebrity ? " Ken grinned . " I 'm numb . " Someone sent a bottle of wine to the table . " I do n't need anything to drink , " Jennifer said . " I feel as though I 'm already drunk . " But she was thirsty and she drank three glasses of wine while she rehashed the trial with Ken . " I was scared . Do you know what it 's like to hold someone else 's life in your hands ? It 's like playing God . Can you think of anything scarier than that ? I mean , I come from Kelso . . . could we have another bottle of wine , Ken ? " " Anything you want .

He helped her up the four flights of stairs and into her little apart- ment . He was breathing hard from the climb . " You know , " Ken said , " I can feel the effects of all that wine . " Jennifer looked at him pityingly . " People who ca n't handle it shoudn ' drink . " And she passed out cold . She was awakened by the shrill screaming of the telephone .

SIDNEY SHELDON 117 " They 're for you . " Ken grinned . " They have n't stopped ! You need a switchboard . " There were calls from newspapers and national magazines and television and radio stations wanting to do in-depth stories on Jennifer . Overnight , she had become big news . There were other calls , the kind of which she had dreamed . Law firms that had snubbed her before were telephoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet with them .

" They were talking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were three of them in the room : Nick Vito , Joseph Colella and Salvatore " Little Flower " Fiore . Nick Vito was a cadaverous-looking man with thin lips that were almost invisible , and deep green eyes that were dead . He wore two hundred dollar shoes and white socks . Joseph " Big Joe " Colella was a huge slab of a man , a granite monolith , and when he walked he looked like a building mov-118ing . Someone had once called him a vegetable garden . " Colella 's got a potato nose , cauliflower ears and a pea brain . " Colella had a soft , high-pitched voice and a deceptively gentle manner . He owned a race horse and had an uncanny knack for picking winners . He was a family man with a wife and six children . His specialties were guns , acid and chains . Joe 's wife , Carmelina , was a strict Catholic , and on Sundays when Colella was not working , he always took his family to church . The third man , Salvatore Fiore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches and weighed a hundred and fifteen pounds . He had the innocent face of a choirboy and was equally adept with a gun or a knife . Women were greatly attracted to the little man , and he boasted a wife , half a dozen girl friends , and a beautiful mistress . Fiore had once been a jockey , working the tracks from Pimlico to Tijuana . When the racing commissioner at Hollywood Park banned Fiore for doping a horse , the commissioner 's body was found floating in Lake Tahoe a week later . The three men were soldati in Antonio Granelli 's Family , but it was Michael Moretti who had brought them in , and they belonged to him , body and soul . In the dining room , a Family meeting was taking place . Seated at the head of the table was Antonio Granelli , capo of the most powerful Mafia Family on the east coast . Seventy-two years old , he was still a powerful-looking man with the shoulders and broad chest of a laborer , and a shock of white hair . Born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was fifteen and went to work on the waterfront on the west side of lower Manhattan . By the time he was twenty-one , he was lieutenant to the dock boss . The two men had an argument , and when the boss mysteriously disappeared , Antonio Granelli had taken over . Anyone who wanted to work on the docks had to pay him . He had used the money to begin his120 RAGE OF ANGELSclimb to power , and had expanded rapidly , branching out into loan-sharking and the numbers racket , prostitution and gambling and drugs and murder . Over the years he had been indicted thirty-two times and had only been convicted once , on a minor assault charge . Granelli was a ruthless man with the down-to-earth cunning of a peasant , and a total amorality . To Granelli 's left sat Thomas Colfax , the Family consigliere . Twenty-five years earlier , Colfax had had a brilliant future as a corporation lawyer , but he had defended a small olive-oil company which turned out to be Mafia-controlled and , step by step , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the years , the Granelli Family had become his sole client . It was a very lucrative client and Thomas Colfax became a wealthy man , with extensive real estate holdings and bank accounts all over the world . To the right of Antonio Granelli sat Michael Moretti , his son-in-law . Michael was ambitious , a trait that made Granelli nervous . Michael did not fit into the pattern of the Family . His father , Giovanni , a distant cousin of Antonio Granelli , had been born not in Sicily but in Florence . That alone made the Moretti family suspect  --  everybody knew that Florentines were not to be trusted . Giovanni Moretti had come to America and opened a shop as a shoemaker , running it honestly , without even a back room for gambling or loan-sharking or girls . Which made him stupid . Giovanni 's son , Michael , was entirely different . He had put himself through Yale and the Wharton School of Business . When Michael had finished school , he had gone to his father with one request : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old shoemaker had gone to see - his cousin and the meeting had been arranged . Granelli was sure that Michael was going to ask for a loan so that he could go into some kind of business , maybe open a shoe shop like his dumb father . But the meeting had been a surprise . " I know how to make you rich , " Michael Moretti had begun . SIDNEY SHELDON 121Antonio Granelli had looked at the impudent young man and had smiled tolerantly . " I am rich . " " No . You just think you 're rich . " The smile had died away . " What the hell you talkin ' about , kid ? " And Michael Moretti had told him . Antonio Granelli had moved cautiously at first , testing each piece of Michael 's advice . Everything had succeeded brilliantly . Where before , the Granelli Family had been involved in profitable illegal activities , under Michael Moretti 's supervisionit branched out . Within five years the Family was into dozens of legitimate businesses , including meat-packing , linen supplies , restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needed financing and the Family went in as a minor partner and gradually took over , stripping away whatever assets there were . Old companieswith impeccable reputations suddenly found themselves bankrupt . The businesses that showed a satisfactory profit , Michael hung on to and he increased the profits tremendously , for the workers in those businesses were controlled by his unions , and the company took their insurance through one of the Family-owned insurance companies , and they bought their automobiles from one of the Family 's automobile dealers . Michael created a symbiotic giant , a series of businesses through which the consumer was constantly being milkedandthe milk flowed to the Family . In spite of his successes , Michael Moretti was aware that he had a problem . Once he had shown Antonio Granelli the rich , ripe horizons of legitimate enterprise , Granelli no longer needed him . He was expensive , because in the beginning he had persuaded Antonio Granelli to give him a percentage of what everyone was sure would be a small pot . But as Michael 's ideas began to bear fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By chance , Michael learned that Granelli122 RAGE OF ANGELS had held a meeting to discuss what the Family should do with him . " I do n't like to see all this money goin ' to the kid , " Granelli had said . " We get rid of him . " Michael had circumvented that scheme by marrying into the Family . Rosa , Antonio Granelli 's only daughter , was nine- teen years old . Her mother had died giving birth to her , and Rosa had been brought up in a convent and was allowed to come home only during the holidays . Her father adored her , and he saw to it that she was protected and sheltered . It was on a school holiday , an Easter , that Rosa met Michael Moretti . By the time she returned to the convent , she was madly in love with him . The memory of his dark good looks drove her to do things when she was alone that the nuns told her were sins against God . Antonio Granelli was under the delusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but over the years , Rosa 's classmates had shown her newspaper and maga- zinc articles about her father and his real business , and when- ever the government made an attempt to indict and convict one of the Granelli Family , Rosa was always aware of it . She never discussed it with her father , and so he remained happy in his belief that his daughter was an innocent and that she was spared the shock of knowing the truth . The truth , if he had know it , would have surprised Granelli for Rosa found her father 's business terribly exciting . She hated the discipline of the nuns at the convent and that , in turn , led her to hate all authority . She daydreamed about her father as a kind of Robin Hood , challenging authority , defying the government . The fact that Michael Moretti was an im- portant man in her father 's organization made him that much more exciting to her . From the beginning , Michael was very careful how he handled Rosa . When he managed to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael never let it go too far . Rosa was a virgin and she was willing  --  eagertogive herself to the man she loved . It was Michael who held back . " I respect you too much , Rosa , to go to bed with you before we 're married . " In reality , it was Antonio Granelli he respected too much . He 'd chop my balls off , Michael thought . And so it happened that at the time Antonio Granelli was discussing the best way to get rid of Michael Moretti , Michael and Rosa came to him and announced that they were in love and intended to get married . The old man screamed and raged and gave a hundred reasons why it would happen only over someone 's dead body . But in the end , true love prevailed and Michael and Rosa were married in an elaborate ceremony . After the wedding the old man had called Michael aside . " Rosa 's all I got , Michael . You take good care of her , huh ? " " I will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you . You better make her happy . You know what I mean , Mike ? " " I know what you mean . " " No whores or chippies . Understand ? Rosa likes to cook . You see that you 're home for dinner every night . You 're gon na be a son-in-law to be proud of . " " I 'm going to try very hard , Tony . " Antonio Granelli had said casually , " Oh , by the way , Mike , now that you 're a member of the Family , that royalty deal I gave you  --  maybe we ought a change it . " Michael had clapped him on the arm . " Thanks , Papa , but it 's enough for us . I 'll be able to buy Rosa everything she wants . " And he had walked away , leaving the old man staring after him . That had been seven years earlier , and the years that fol-124 RAGE OF ANGELS lowed had been wonderful for Michael . Rosa was pleasant and easy to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died or went away , he would get along without her . He would simply find someone else to do the things she did for him . He was not in love with Rosa . Michael did not think he was capable of loving another human being ; it was as though something was missing in him . He had no feelings for people , only for animals . Michael had been given a collie puppy for his tenth birthday . The two of them were inseparable . Six weeks later the dog had been killed in a hit-and-run accident , and when Michael 's father offered to buy him another dog , Michael had refused . He had never owned another dog after that . Michael had grown up watching his father slaving his life away for pennies , and Michael had resolved that would never happen to him . He had known what he wanted from the time he had first heard talk about his famous distant cousin Antonio Granelli . There were twenty-six Mafia Families in the United States , five of them in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From his earliest childhood , Michael thrived on tales of the Mafia . His father told him about the night of the Sicilian Vespers , September 10 , 1931 , when the balance of power had changed hands . In that single night , the Young Turks in the Mafia staged a bloody coup that wiped out more than forty Mustache Petes , the old guard who had come over from Italy and Sicily . Michael was of the new generation . He had gotten rid of the old thinking and had brought in fresh ideas . A nine-man na- tional commission controlled all the Families now , and Michael knew that one day he would run that commission . Michael turned now to study the two men seated at the dining room table of the New Jersey farmhouse . Antonio Granelli still had a few years left but , with luck , not too many . Thomas Colfax was the enemy . The lawyer had been against Michael from the beginning . As Michael 's influence with the old man had increased , Colfax 's had decreased . Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Organization , men like Nick Vito and Salvatore Fiore and Joseph Colella , who were fiercely loyal to him . Thomas Colfax had not liked that . When Michael had been indicted for the murders of the Ramos brothers , and Camillo Stela had agreed to testify against him in court , the old lawyer had believed that he was finally going to be rid of Michael , for the District Attorney had an airtight case . Michael had thought of a way out in the middle of the night . At four in the morning , he had gone out to a telephone booth and called Joseph Colella . " Next week some new lawyers are going to be sworn in on the District Attorney 's staff . Can you get me their names ? " " Sure , Mike . Easy . " " One more thing . Call Detroit and have them fly in a cherry  --  one of their boys who 's never been tagged . " And Michael had hung up . Two weeks later , Michael Moretti had sat in the courtroom studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , his eyes traveling from face to face , searching and judging . What he planned to do was dangerous , but its very daring could make it work . He was dealing with young beginners who would be too nervous to ask a lot of questions , and anxious to be helpful and make their mark . Well , someone was certainly going to make his mark . Michael had finally selected Jennifer Parker . He liked the fact that she was inexperienced and that she was tense and trying to hide it . He liked the fact that she was female and would feel under more pressure than the men . When Michael126 RAGE OF ANGELS was satisfied with his decision , he turned to a man in a gray suit sitting among the spectators and nodded toward Jennifer . That was all . Michael had watched as the District Attorney had finished his examination of that son-of-a-bitch , Camillo Stela . He had turned to Thomas Colfax and said , Your witness for cross . Thomas Colfax had risen to his feet . If it please Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer not to have my cross- examination interrupted . Might I request that the court recess for lunch now and I 'll cross-examine this afternoon ? And a recess had been declared . Now was the moment ! Michael saw his man casually drift up to join the men who were crowded around the District Attorney . The man made himself a part of the group . A few moments later , he walked over to Jennifer and handed her a large envelope . Michael sat there , holding his breath , willing Jennifer to take the envelope and move toward the witness room . She did . It was not until he saw her return without it that Michael Moretti relaxed . That had been a year ago . The newspapers had crucified the girl , but that was her problem . Michael had not given any further thought to Jennifer Parker until the newspapers had begun recently to feature the Abraham Wilson trial . They had dragged up the old Michael Moretti case and Jennifer Parker 's part in it . They had run her picture . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a sense of in- dependence about her that stirred something in him . He stared at the picture for a long time . Michael began to follow the Abraham Wilson trial with in- creasing interest . When the boys had celebrated with a victory dinner after Michael 's mistrial was declared , Salvatore Fiore had proposed a toast . " The world got rid of one more fuckin ' lawyer . " But the world had not gotten rid of her , Michael thought . Jennifer Parker had bounced back and was still in there , fighting . Michael liked that . He had seen her on television the night before , discussing her victory over Robert Di Silva , and Michael had been oddly pleased . Antonio Granelli had asked , " Ai n't she the mouthpiece you set up , Mike ? " " Uh-huh . She 's got a brain , Tony . Maybe we can use her one of these days . " 10The day after the Abraham Wilson verdict , Adam Warner telephoned . " I just called to congratulate you . " Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have believed possible . " This is  --  " " I know . " Oh , God , Jennifer thought . Why did I say that ? There was no reason to let Adam know how often she had thought about him in the past few months . " I wanted to tell you I thought you handled the Abraham Wilson case brilliantly . You deserved to win it . " " Thank you . " He 's going to hang up , Jennifer thought . I 'll never see him again . He 's probably too busy with his harem . And Adam Warner was saying , " I was wondering if you 'd care to have dinner with me one evening ? " Men hate overeager girls . " What about tonight ? " Jennifer heard the smile in his voice . " I 'm afraid my first free night is Friday . Are you busy ? " 128SIDNEY SHELDON 129 " No . " She had almost said , Of course not . " Shall I pick you up at your place ? " Jennifer thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ironing board set up in a corner . " It might be easier if we met somewhere . " " Do you like the food at Lutece ? " " May I tell you after I 've eaten there ? " He laughed . " How 's eight o'clock ? " " Eight o'clock is lovely . " Lovely . Jennifer replaced the receiver and sat there in a glow of euphoria . This is ridiculous , she thought . He 's probablymarried and has two dozen children . Almost the first thing Jennifer had noticed about Adam when they had had dinner was that he was not wearing a wedding ring . Inconclusiveevidence , she thought wryly . There definitely should be a law forcing all husbands to wear wedding rings . Ken Bailey walked into the office . " How 's the master attorney ? " He looked at her more closely . " You look like you just swallowed a client . " Jennifer hesitated , then said , " Ken , would you run a check on someone for me ? " He walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shoot . Who is it ? " She started to say Adam 's name , then stopped , feeling like a fool . What business had she prying into Adam Warner 's private life ? For God 's sake , she told herself , all he did is ask you to have dinner with him , not marry him . " Never mind . " Ken put the pencil down . " Whatever you say . " " Ken  --  " " Yes ? " " Adam Warner . His name is Adam Warner . " Ken looked at her in surprise . " Hell , you do n't need me to run a check on him . Just read the newspapers . " " What do you know about him ? " Ken Bailey flopped into a chair across from Jennifer and steepled his fingers together . " Let me see . He 's a partner in Needham , Finch , Pierce and Warner ; Harvard Law School ; comes from a rich socialite family ; in his middle thirties  --  " Jennifer looked at him curiously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He winked . " I have friends in high places . There 's a rumor they 're going to run Mr. Warner for the United States Senate . There 's even a little presidential ground swell going on . He 's got what they call charisma . " He certainly has , Jennifer thought . She tried to make her next question sound casual . " What about his personal life ? " Ken Bailey looked at her oddly . " He 's married to the daughter of an ex-Secretary of the Navy . She 's the niece of Stewart Needham , Warner 's law partner . " Jennifer 's heart sank . So that was that . Ken was watching her , puzzled . " Why this sudden interest in Adam Warner ? " " Just curious . " Long after Ken Bailey had left , Jennifer sat there thinking about Adam . He asked me to dinner as a professional courtesy . He wants to congratulate me . But he 's already done that over the telephone . Who cares why ? I 'm going to see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a wife . Of course not . Well , I 'll have dinner with Adam on Friday night and that will be the end of that . Late that afternoon , Jennifer received a telephone call from Peabody &; Peabody . It was from the senior partner himself . " I 've been meaning to get around to this for some time , " he said . " I wondered if you and I might have lunch soon . " His casual tone did not deceive Jennifer . She was sure the idea of having lunch with her had not occurred to him until after he had read about the Abraham Wilson decision . He certainly did not want to meet with her to discuss serving subpoenas . " What about tomorrow ? " he suggested . " My club . " They met for lunch the following day . The senior Peabody was a pale , prissy man , an older version of his son . His vest failed to conceal a slight paunch . Jennifer liked the father just as little as she had liked the son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney in our firm , Miss Parker . We can offer you fifteen thousand dollars a year to start with . " Jennifer sat there listening to him , thinking how much that offer would have meant to her a year earlier when she had desperately needed a job , needed someone who believed in her . He was saying , " I 'm sure that within a few years there would be room for a partnership for you in our firm . " Fifteen thousand dollars a year and a partnership . Jennifer thought about the little office she shared with Ken , and her tiny , shabby four-flight walk-up apartment with its fake fireplace . Mr. Peabody was taking her silence for acquiescence . " Good . We 'd like you to begin as soon as possible . Perhaps you could start Monday . I  --  " " No . " " Oh . Well , if Monday 's not convenient for you  --  " " I mean , no , I ca n't take your offer , Mr. Peabody , " Jennifer said , and amazed herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps we could start you at twenty thousand dollars a year . " He saw the expression on her face . " Or twenty-five thousand . Why do n't you think it over ? " " I 've thought it over . I 'm going to stay in business for myself . " The clients were beginning to come . Not a great many and132 RAGE OF ANGELSnot very affluent , but they were clients . The office was becoming too small for her . One morning after Jennifer had kept two clients waiting outside in the hallway while she was dealing with a third , Ken said , " This is n't going to work . You 're going to have to move out of here and get yourself a decent office uptown . " Jennifer nodded . " I know . I 've been thinking about it . " Ken busied himself with some papers so that he did not have to meet her eyes . " I 'll miss you . " " What are you talking about ? You have to go with me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked up and a broad grin creased his freckled face . " Go with you ? " He glanced around the cramped , windowlessroom . " And give up all this ? " The following week , Jennifer and Ken Bailey moved into larger offices in the five hundred block on Fifth Avenue . The new quarters were simply furnished and consisted of three small rooms : one for Jennifer , one for Ken and one for a secretary . The secretary they hired was a young girl named Cynthia Ellman fresh out of New York University . " There wo n't be a lot for you to do for a while , " Jennifer apologized , " but things will pick up . " " Oh , I know they will , Miss Parker . " There was heroine worship in the girl 's voice . She wants to be like me , Jennifer thought . God forbid ! Ken Bailey walked in and said , " Hey , I get lonely in that big office all by myself . How about dinner and the theater tonight ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had some briefs to read , but Ken was her best friend and she could not refuse him . " I 'd love to go . " SIDNEY SHELDON 133 * * *They went to see Applause , and Jennifer enjoyed it tremendously . Lauren Bacall was totally captivating . Jennifer and Ken had supper afterward at Sardi 's . When they had ordered , Ken said , " I have two tickets for the ballet Friday night . I thought we might  --  " Jennifer said , " I 'm sorry , Ken . I 'm busy Friday night . " " Oh . " His voice was curiously flat . From time to time , Jennifer would find Ken staring at her when he thought he was unobserved , and there was an expression on his face that Jennifer found hard to define . She knew Ken was lonely , although he never talked about any of his friends and never discussed his personal life . She could not forget what Otto had told her , and she wondered whether Ken himself knew what he wanted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help him . It seemed to Jennifer that Friday was never going to arrive . As her dinner date with Adam Warner drew closer , Jennifer found it more and more difficult to concentrate on business . She found herself thinking about Adam constantly . She knew she was being ridiculous . She had seen the man only once in her life , and yet she was unable to get him out of her mind . She tried to rationalize by telling herself that it was because he had saved her when she was facing disbarment proceedings , and then had sent her clients . That was true , but Jennifer knew it was more than that . It was something she could not explain , even to herself . It was a feeling she had never had before , an attraction she had never felt for any other man . She wondered what Adam Warner 's wife was like . She was undoubtedly one of the chosen women who , every Wednesday , walked through the red door at Elizabeth Arden 's for a day of head-to-toe pampering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aura of the wealthy socialite. 134 RAGE OF ANGELS * * * On the magic Friday morning at ten o'clock , Jennifer made an appointment with a new Italian hairdresser Cynthia had told her all the models were going to . At ten-thirty , Jennifer called to cancel it . At eleven , she rescheduled the appointment . Ken Bailey invited Jennifer to lunch , but she was too nervous to eat anything . Instead , she went shopping at Bendel 's , where she bought a short , dark green chiffon dress that matched her eyes , a pair of slender brown pumps and a matching purse . She knew she was far over her budget , but she could not seem to stop herself . She passed the perfume department on the way out , and on an insane impulse bought a bottle of Joy perfume . It was insane because the man was married . Jennifer left the office at five o'clock and went home to change . She spent two hours bathing and dressing for Adam , and when she was finished she studied herself critically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiffured hair and tied it back with a green ribbon . That 's better , she thought . I 'm a lawyer going to have dinner with another lawyer . But when she closed the door she left behind a faint fragrance of rose and jasmine . Lutece was nothing like what Jennifer had expected . A French tricolor flew above the entrance of the small town house . Inside , a narrow hall led to a small bar and beyond was a sunroom , bright and gay , with porch wicker and plaid tablecloths . Jennifer was met at the door by the owner , Andre Soltner . " May I help you ? " " I 'm meeting Mr. Adam Warner . I think I 'm a little early . " He waved Jennifer toward the small bar . " Would you care for a drink while you are waiting , Miss Parker ? " " That would be nice , " Jennifer said . " Thank you . " " I 'll send a waiter over . " Jennifer took a seat and amused herself watching the bejeweledand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard about Lutece . It was reputed to be Jacqueline Kennedy 's favorite restaurant and to have excellentfood . A distinguished-looking gray-haired man walked up to Jennifer and said , " Mind if I join you for a moment ? " Jennifer stiffened . " I 'm waiting for someone , " she began . " He should be here  --  " He smiled and sat down . " This is n't a pickup , Miss Parker . " Jennifer looked at him in surprise , unable to place him . " I 'm Lee Browning , of Holland and Browning . " It was one of the most prestigious law firms in New York . " I just wanted to congratulate you on the way you handled the Wilson trial . " " Thank you , Mr. Browning . " " You took a big chance . It was a no-win case . " He studied her a moment . " The rule is , when you 're on the wrong side of a no-win case , make sure it 's one where there 's no publicityinvolved . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the rug . You fooled a lot of us . Have you ordered a drink yet ? " " No --   --  " May I  --  ? " He beckoned to a waiter . " Victor , bring us a bottle of champagne , would you ? Dom Perignon . " " Right away , Mr. Browning . " Jennifer smiled . " Are you trying to impress me ? " He laughed aloud . " I 'm trying to hire you . I imagine you 've been getting a lot of offers . " " A few . " " Our firm deals mostly in corporate work , Miss Parker , but some of our more affluent clients frequently get carried away and have need of a criminal defense attorney . I think136 RAGE OF ANGELS we could make you a very attractive proposal . Would you care to stop by my office and discuss it ? " " Thank you , Mr. Browning . I 'm really flattered , but I just moved into my own offices . I 'm hoping it will work out . " He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He raised his eyes as someone approached and got to his feet and held out his hand . " Adam , how are you ? " Jennifer looked up and Adam Warner was standing there shaking hands with Lee Browning . Jennifer 's heart began to beat faster and she could feel her face flush . Idiot schoolgirl ! Adam Warner looked at Jennifer and Browning and said , " You two know each other ? " " We were just beginning to get acquainted , " Lee Browning said easily . " You arrived a little too soon . " " Or just in time . " He took Jennifer 's arm . " Better luck next time , Lee . " The captain came up to Adam . " Would you like your table now , Mr. Warner , or would you like to have a drink at the bar first ? " " We 'll take a table , Henri . " When they had been seated , Jennifer looked around the room and recognized half a dozen celebrities . " This place is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " It is now . " Jennifer felt herself blush again . Stop it , you fool . She wondered how many other girls Adam Warner had brought here while his wife was sitting at home , waiting for him . She wondered if any of them ever learned that he was married , or whether he always managed to keep that a secret from them . Well , she had an advantage . You 're going to be in for a surprise , Mr. Warner , Jennifer thought . They ordered drinks and dinner and busied themselves making small talk . Jennifer let Adam do most of the talking . He was witty and charming , but she was armored against his charm . It was not easy . She found herself smiling at his anecdotes , laughing at his stories . It wo n't do him any good , Jennifer told herself . She was not looking for a fling . The specter of her mother haunted her . There was a deep passion within Jennifer that she was afraid to explore , afraid to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one word that could be misconstrued . Jennifer had been building up her defenses for nothing , fending off an attack that had never materialized , and she felt like a fool . She wondered what Adam would have said if he had known what she had been thinking all evening . Jennifer smiled at her own vanity . " I never got a chance to thank you for the clients you sent me , " Jennifer said . " I did telephone you a few times , but  --  " " I know . " Adam hesitated , then added awkwardly , " I did n't want to return your phone calls . " Jennifer looked at him in surprise . " I was afraid to , " he said simply . And there it was . He had taken her by surprise , caught her off guard , but his meaning was unmistakable . Jennifer knew what was coming next . And she did not want him to say it . She did not want him to be like all the others , the married men who pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to despise this man . Adam said quietly , " Jennifer , I want you to know I 'm married . " She sat there staring at him , her mouth open . " I 'm sorry . I should have told you sooner . " He smiled wryly . " Well , there really was no sooner , was there ? " Jennifer was filled with a strange confusion . " Why  --  why did you ask me to dinner , Adam ? " " Because I had to see you again . " Everything began to seem unreal to Jennifer . It was as though she were being pulled under by some giant tidal138 RAGE OF ANGELS wave . She sat there listening to Adam saying all the things he felt , and she knew that every word was true . She knew be- cause she felt the same way . She wanted him to stop before he said too much . She wanted him to go on and say more . " I hope I 'm not offending you , " Adam said . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , I  --  I  --  " He looked at her and even though they had not touched , it was as if she were in his arms . Jennifer said shakily , " Tell me about your wife . " " Mary Beth and I have been married fifteen years . We have no children . " " I see . " " She  --  we decided not to have any . We were both very young when we got married . I had known her a long time . Our families were neighbors at a summer place we had in Maine . When she was eighteen , her parents were killed in a plane crash . Mary Beth was almost insane with grief . She was all alone . I  --  we got married . " He married her out of pity and he 's too much of a gentle- man to say so , Jennifer thought . " She 's a wonderful woman . We 've always had a very good relationship . " He was telling Jennifer more than she wanted to know , more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away , to flee . In the past she had easily been able to cope with the married men who had tried to become involved with her , but Jennifer knew instinctively that this was different . If she ever let herself fall in love with this man , there would be no way out . She would have to be insane ever to begin any- thing with him . Jennifer spoke carefully . " Adam , I like you very much . I do n't get involved with married men . " He smiled , and his eyes behind the glasses held honesty and warmth . " I 'm not looking for a backstreet affair . I enjoy beingwith you . I 'm very proud of you . I 'd like us to see each other once in a while . " Jennifer started to say , What good would that do ? but the words came out , " That would be good . " So we 'll have lunch once a month , Jennifer thought . It ca n't hurt anything . One of Jennifer 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered around the three small rooms and said , " Very nice , indeed . We 're getting up in the world , Jennifer . " Jennifer laughed . " This is n't exactly getting up in the world , Father . I have a long way to go . " He eyed her keenly . " You 'll make it . By the way , I went to visit Abraham Wilson last week . " " How is he getting along ? " " Fine . They have him working in the prison machine shop . He asked me to give you his regards . " " I 'll have to visit him myself one day soon . " Father Ryan sat in his chair , staring at her , until Jennifer said , " Is there something I can do for you , Father ? " He brightened . " Ah , well , I know you must be busy , but now that you 've brought it up , a friend of mine has a bit of a problem . She was in an accident . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140Automatically Jennifer replied , " Have her come in and see me , Father . " " I think you 'll have to go to her . She 's a quadruple amputee . " Connie Garrett lived in a small , neat apartment on Houston Street . The door was opened for Jennifer by an elderly whitehairedwoman wearing an apron . " I 'm Martha Steele , Connie 's aunt . I live with Connie . Please come in . She 's expecting you . " Jennifer walked into a meagerly furnished living room . Connie Garrett was propped up with pillows in a large armchair . Jennifer was shocked by her youth . For some reason , she had expected an older woman . Connie Garrett was about twenty-four , Jennifer 's age . There was a wonderful radiance in her face , and Jennifer found it obscene that there was only a torso with no arms or legs attached to it . She repressed a shudder . Connie Garrett gave her a warm smile and said , " Please sit down , Jennifer . May I call you Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , of course , I 've seen you on television . I 'm so glad you could come . " Jennifer started to reply , " My pleasure , " and realized how inane it would have sounded . She sat down in a soft comfortable chair opposite the young woman . " Father Ryan said you were in an accident a few years ago . Do you want to tell me what happened ? " " It was my fault , I 'm afraid . I was crossing an intersection and I stepped off the sidewalk and slipped and fell in front of a truck . " " How long ago was this ? " " Three years ago last December . I was on my way to Bloomingdale 's to do some Christmas shopping . " " What happened after the truck hit you ? " " I do n't remember anything . I woke up in the hospital. 142 RAGE OF ANGELS They told me that an ambulance brought me there . There was an injury to my spine . Then they found bone damage and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug . It was a pitiful gesture . " They tried to fit me with artificial limbs , but they do n't work on me . " " Did you bring suit ? " She looked at Jennifer , puzzled . " Father Ryan did n't tell you ? " " Tell me what ? " " My lawyer sued the utility company whose truck hit me , and we lost the case . We appealed and lost the appeal . " Jennifer said , " He should have mentioned that . If the appel- late court turned you down , I 'm afraid there 's nothing that can be done . " Connie Garrett nodded . " I did n't really believe there was . I just thought  --  well , Father Ryan said you could work miracles . " " That 's his territory . I 'm only a lawyer . " She was angry with Father Ryan for having given Connie Garrett false hope . Grimly , Jennifer decided she would have a talk with him . The older woman was hovering in the background . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cake , per- haps ? " Jennifer suddenly realized she was hungry , for she had had no time for lunch . But she visualized sitting opposite Connie Garrett while she was being fed by hand , and she could not bear the thought . " No , thanks , " Jennifer lied . " I just had lunch . " All Jennifer wanted to do was get out of there as quickly as possible . She tried to think of some cheering note she could leave on , but there was nothing . Damn Father Ryan ! " I  --  I 'm really sorry . I wish I  --  " Connie Garrett smiled and said , " Please do n't worry about it . " It was the smile that did it . Jennifer was sure if she had been in Connie Garrett 's place she would never have been able to smile . " Who was your lawyer ? " Jennifer heard herself asking . " Melvin Hutcherson . Do you know him ? " " No , but I 'll look him up . " She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk with him . " " That would be so nice of you . " There was warm appreciationin Connie Garrett 's voice . Jennifer thought of what the girl 's life must be like , sitting there totally helpless , day after day , month after month , year after year , unable to do anything for herself . " I ca n't promise anything , I 'm afraid . " " Of course not . But do you know something , Jennifer ? I feel better just because you came . " Jennifer rose to her feet . It was a moment to shake hands , but there was no hand to shake . She said awkwardly , " It was nice meeting you , Connie . You 'll hear from me . " On the way back to her office , Jennifer thought about Father Ryan and resolved that she would never succumb to his blandishments again . There was nothing anyone could do for that poor crippled girl , and to offer her any kind of hope was indecent . But she would keep her promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to her office there was a long list of messages for her . She looked through them quickly , looking for a message from Adam Warner . There was none. 12Melvin Hutcherson was a short , balding man with a tiny button nose and washed-out pale blue eyes . He had a shabby suite of offices on the West Side that reeked of poverty . The receptionist 's desk was empty . " Gone to lunch , " Melvin Hutcherson explained . Jennifer wondered if he had a secretary . He ushered her into his private office , which was no larger than the reception office . " You told me over the phone you wanted to talk about Connie Garrett . " " That 's right . " He shrugged . " There 's not that much to talk about . We sued and we lost . Believe me , I did a bang-up job for her . " " Did you handle the appeal ? " " Yep . We lost that , too . I 'm afraid you 're spinning your wheels . " He regarded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time on something like this ? You 're hot . You could be working on big money cases . " SIDNEY SHELDON 145 " I 'm doing a friend a favor . Would you mind if I looked at the transcripts ? " " Help yourself , " Hutcherson shrugged . " They 're public property . " Jennifer spent the evening going over the transcripts of ConnieGarrett 's lawsuit . To Jennifer 's surprise , Melvin Hutchersonhad told the truth : He had done a good job . He had named both the city and the Nationwide Motors Corporation as co-defendants , and had demanded a trial by jury . The jury had exonerated both defendants . The Department of Sanitation had done its best to cope with the snowstorm that had swept the city that December ; all its equipment had been in use . The city had argued that the storm was an act of God , and that if there was any negligence , it was on the part of Connie Garrett . Jennifer turned to the charges against the truck company . Three eyewitnesses had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid hitting the victim , but that he had been unable to brake in time , and the truck had gone into an unavoidable spin and had hit her . The verdict in favor of the defendant had been upheld by the Appellate Division and the case had been closed . Jennifer finished reading the transcripts at three o'clock in the morning . She turned off the lights , unable to sleep . On paper , justice had been done . But the image of Connie Garrett kept coming into her mind . A girl in her twenties , without arms or legs . Jennifer visualized the truck hitting the young girl , the awful agony she must have suffered , the series of terrible operations that had been performed , each one cutting away parts of her limbs . Jennifer turned on the light and sat up in bed . She dialed Melvin Hutcherson 's home number . " There 's nothing in the transcripts about the doctors , " Jennifersaid into the telephone .

What about those operations that were performed on Connie Garrett ? Did you check into them ? " There was a pause while Melvin Hutcherson tried to gather his thoughts . " I talked to the heads of neurology and orthopedicsat the hospital that took care of her . The operations were necessary to save her life . They were performed by the top men there and were done properly . That 's why the hospitalwas n't named in the suit . " Jennifer felt a sharp sense of frustration . " I see . " " Look , I told you before , you 're wasting your time on this one . Now why do n't we both get some sleep ? " And the receiver clicked in Jennifer 's ear . She turned out the light and lay back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while , Jennifer gave up the struggle , arose and made herself a pot of coffee . She sat on her sofa drinking it , watching the rising sun paint the Manhattan skyline , the faint pink gradually turning into a bright , explosive red . Jennifer was disturbed . For every injustice there was supposedto be a remedy at law . Had justice been done in Connie Garrett 's case ? She glanced at the clock on the wall . It was six-thirty . Jennifer picked up the telephone again and dialed Melvin Hutcherson 's number . " Did you check out the record of the truck driver ? " Jennifer asked . A sleepy voice said , " Jesus Christ ! Are you some kind of crazy ? When do you sleep ? " " The driver of the utility truck . Did you check out his record ? " " Lady , you 're beginning to insult me .

" " Thanks a lot ! " Jennifer replaced the receiver . It was time to get dressed and go to work. 13v r rdefinitely not available . The moment she heard Adam 's voice she forgot all those things and said , Of course I am . The last thing in the world she should have said . They had lunch at a small restaurant in Chinatown , and they talked steadily for two hours that seemed like two minutes . They talked about law and politics and the theater , and solved all the complex problems of the world . Adam was brilliant and incisive and fascinating . He was genuinely interested in what Jennifer was doing , and took a joyous pride in her successes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for him , I 'd be back in Kelso , Washington . It had been three weeks since Jennifer had had dinner with Adam at Lutece . She tried to put him out of her mind , but everything reminded her of Adam : A chance phrase , the back of a stranger 's head , a tie similar to the one he had worn . There were many men who tried to date her . She was propositionedby clients , by attorneys she had opposed in court and by a night-court judge , but Jennifer wanted none of them . Lawyers invited her out for what was cynically referred to as " funch , " but she was not interested . There was an independenceabout her that was a challenge to men . Ken Bailey was always there , but that fact did nothing to assuage Jennifer 's loneliness . There was only one person who could do that , damn him ! He telephoned on a Monday morning . " I thought I 'd take a chance and see if you happened to be free for lunch today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I am . " Jennifer had sworn to herself that if Adam ever called herWhen Jennifer returned to the office , Ken Bailey was waiting for her . " Have a good lunch ? " " Yes , thank you . " " Is Adam Warner going to become a client ? " His tone was too casual . " No , Ken . We 're just friends . " And it was true . The following week , Adam invited Jennifer to have lunch in the private dining room of his law firm . Jennifer was impressed with the huge , modern complex of offices . Adam introducedher to various members of the firm , and Jennifer felt like a minor celebrity , for they seemed to know all about her . She met Stewart Needham , the senior partner . He was distantly polite to Jennifer , and she remembered that Adam was married to his niece . Adam and Jennifer had lunch in the walnut-paneled dining room run by a chef and two waiters . " This is where the partners bring their problems . " 148150 RAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hard for her to concentrate on the meal . Jennifer thought about Adam all that afternoon . She knew she had to forget about him , had to stop seeing him . He belonged to another woman . That night , Jennifer went with Ken Bailey to see Two by Two , the new Richard Rodgers show . As they stepped into the lobby there was an excited buzz from the crowd , and Jennifer turned to see what was happening . A long , black limousine had pulled up to the curb and a man and woman were stepping out of the car . " It 's him ! " a woman exclaimed , and people began to gather around the car . The burly chauffeur stepped aside and Jennifersaw Michael Moretti and his wife . It was Michael that the crowd focused on . He was a folk hero , handsome enough to be a movie star , daring enough to have captured everyone 's imagination . Jennifer stood in the lobby watching as Michael Moretti and his wife made their way through the crowd . Michael passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes met . Jennifer noticed that his eyes were so black that she could not see his pupils . A moment later he disappeared into the theater . Jennifer was unable to enjoy the show . The sight of Michael Moretti had brought back a flood of fiercely humiliating memories . Jennifer asked Ken to take her home after the first act . Adam telephoned Jennifer the next day and Jennifer steeled herself to refuse his invitation . Thank you , Adam , but I 'm really very busy . But all Adam said was , " I have to go out of the country for a while . " It was like a blow to the stomach . " How  --  how long will you be gone ? " " Just a few weeks . I 'll give you a call when I get back . " " Fine , " Jennifer said brightly . " Have a nice trip . " She felt as though someone had died . She visualized Adam on a beach in Rio , surrounded by half-naked girls , or in a penthouse in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in a Swiss chalet making love to  --  Stop it ! Jennifer told herself . She should have asked him where he was going . It was probably a business trip to some dreary place where he would have no time for women , perhaps the middle of some desert where he would be working twenty-four hours a day . She should have broached the subject , very casually , of course . Will you be taking a long plane trip ? Do you speak any foreign languages ? If you get to Paris , bring me back some Vervaine tea . I suppose the shots must be painful . Are you taking your wife with you ? Am I losing my mind ? Ken had come into her office and was staring at her . " You 're talking to yourself . Are you okay ? " No ! Jennifer wanted to shout . I need a doctor . I need a cold shower . I need Adam Warner . She said , " I 'm fine . Just a little tired . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Adam would be going to bed early . Father Ryan called . " I went to see Connie Garrett . She told me you 've dropped by a few times . " " Yes . " The visits were to assuage her feeling of guilt because she was unable to be of any help . It was frustrating . Jennifer plunged herself into work , and still the weeks seemed to drag by . She was in court nearly every day and worked on briefs almost every night . " Slow down . You 're going to kill yourself , " Ken advised her . But Jennifer needed to exhaust herself physically and152 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 153mentally . She did not want to have time to think . I 'm a fool , she thought . An unadulterated fool . It was four weeks before Adam called . " I just got back , " he said . The sound of his voice thrilled her . " Can we meet for lunch somewhere ? " " Yes . I 'd enjoy that , Adam . " She thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd enjoy that , Adam . " The Oak Room in the Plaza ? " " Fine . " It was the most businesslike , unromantic dining room in the world , filled with affluent middle-aged wheelers and dealers , stockbrokers and bankers . It had long been one of the few remaining bastions of privacy for men , and its doors had only recently been opened to women . Jennifer arrived early and was seated . A few minutes later , Adam appeared . Jennifer watched the tall , lean figure movingtoward her and her mouth suddenly went dry . He looked tanned , and Jennifer wondered if her fantasies about Adam on some girl-ridden beach had been true . He smiled at her and took her hand , and Jennifer knew in that moment that it did not matter what logic she used about Adam Warner or married men . She had no control over herself . It was as though someone else were guiding her , telling her what she should do , telling her what she must do . She could not explain what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Call it chemistry , she thought . Call it karma , call it heaven . All Jennifer knew was that she wanted to be in Adam Warner 's arms more than she had ever wanted anything in her life . Looking at him , she visualized his making love to her , holding her , his hard body on top of her , inside her , and she felt her face becoming red . Adam said apologetically , " Sorry about the short notice . A client canceled a luncheon date . " Jennifer silently blessed the client . " I brought you something , " Adam said . It was a lovely green and gold silk scarf . " It 's from Milan . " So that 's where he had been . Italian girls . " It 's beautiful , Adam . Thank you . " " Have you ever been to Milan ? " " No . I 've seen pictures of the cathedral there . It 's lovely . " " I 'm not much of a sightseer .

It was as though he had her in some kind of spell and she was mesmerized , helpless to break it . At one point Jennifer thought , I know what to do . I 'll make love with him . Once . It ca n't be as wonderful as my fantasies . Then I 'll be able to get over him . When their hands touched accidentally , it was like an electriccharge between them . They sat there talking of everything and nothing , and their words had no meaning . They sat at the table , locked in an invisible embrace , caressing each other , making fierce love , naked and wanton . Neither of them had any idea what they were eating or what they were saying . There was a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mounting , until neither of them could stand it any longer . In the middle of their luncheon , Adam put his hand over Jennifer 's and said huskily , " Jennifer  --  " She whispered , " Yes . Let 's get out of here . " Jennifer waited in the busy , crowded lobby while Adam registered at the desk . They were given a room in the old section of the Plaza Hotel , overlooking 58th Street . They used the back bank of elevators , and it seemed to Jennifer that it took forever to reach their floor . If Jennifer was unable to remember anything about the154 RAGE OF ANGELSluncheon , she remembered everything about their room . Years later , she could recall the view , the color of the drapes and carpets , and each picture and piece of furniture . She could remember the sounds of the city , far below , that drifted into the room . The images of that afternoon were to stay with her the rest of her life . It was a magic , multicolored explosion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Adam 's strong , lean body in bed , his roughness and his gentleness . It was laughter and passion . Their hunger had built to a greed that had to be satisfied . The moment Adam began to make love to her , the words that flashed into Jennifer 's mind were , I 'm lost . They made love again and again , and each time was an ecstasy that was almost unbearable. 14Hours later , as they lay there quietly , Adam said , " I feel as though I 'm alive for the first time in my life . " Jennifer gently stroked his chest and laughed aloud . Adam looked at her quizzically . " What 's so funny ? " " Do you know what I told myself ? That if I went to bedwith you once , I could get you out of my system . " He twisted around and looked down at her . " And  --  ? " " I was wrong . I feel as though you 're a part of me . At least "  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " He knew what she was thinking . " We 'll work something out , " Adam said . " Mary Beth is leaving Monday for Europe with her aunt for a month . " Jennifer and Adam Warner were together almost every night . He spent the first night at her uncomfortable little apartmentand in the morning he declared , " We 're taking the day off to find you a decent place to live . " They went apartment hunting together , and late that afternoonJennifer signed a lease in a new high-rise building off Sutton Place , called The Belmont Towers . The sign in front of the building had read Sold Out . " Why are we going in ? " Jennifer asked . " You 'll see . " The apartment they looked at was a lovely five-room duplex , beautifully furnished . It was the most luxurious apartmentJennifer had ever seen . There was a master bedroom and bath upstairs , and downstairs a guest bedroom with its own bath and a living room that had a spectacular view of the East River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitchen and a dining room. 155156 RAGE OF ANGELS " How do you like it ? " Adam asked . " Like it ? I love it , " Jennifer exclaimed , " but there are two problems , darling . First of all , I could n't possibly afford it . And secondly , even if I could , it belongs to someone else . " " It belongs to our law firm . We leased it for visiting VIP 's . I 'll have them find another place . " " What about the rent ? " " I 'll take care of that . I  --  " " No . " " That 's crazy , darling . I can easily afford it and  --  " She shook her head . " You do n't understand , Adam . I havenothing to give you except me . I want that to be a gift . " He took her in his arms and Jennifer snuggled against himand said , " I know what  --  I 'll work nights . " Saturday they went on a shopping spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bonwit Teller , and Jennifer bought Adam a Turnbull &; Asser shirt . They purchased a chess game at Gimbel 's and cheesecake in Junior 's near Abraham &; Straus . They bought a Fortnum &; Mason plum pudding at Altman 's , and books at Doubleday . They visited the Gammon Shop and Caswell-Massey , where Adam bought Jennifer enough potpourri to last for ten years . They had dinner around the corner from the apartment . They would meet at the apartment in the evening after work and discuss the day 's events , and Jennifer would cook dinner while Adam set the table . Afterward , they read or watched television or played gin rummy or chess . Jennifer prepared Adam 's favorite dishes . " I 'm shameless , " she told him . " I wo n't stop at anything . " He held her close . " Please do n't . " It was strange , Jennifer thought . Before they began their affair they saw each other openly . But now that they wereSIDNEY SHELDON 157lovers , they dared not appear in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apt to run into friends : small family restaurants downtown , a chamber music concert at the Third Street Music School Settlement . They went to see a new play at the Omni Theatre Club on 18th Street and had dinner at the Grotta Azzurra on Broome Street , and ate so much that they swore off Italian food for a month . Only we do n't have a month , Jennifer thought . Mary Beth was returning in fourteen days . They went to The Half Note to hear avant-garde jazz in the Village , and peeked into the windows of the small art galleries . Adam loved sports . He took Jennifer to watch the Knicks play , and Jennifer got so caught up in the game she cheered until she was hoarse . On Sunday they lazed around , having breakfast in their robes , trading sections of the Times , listening to the church bells ring across Manhattan , each offering up its own prayer . Jennifer looked over at Adam absorbed in the crossword puzzle and thought : Say a prayer for me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that it could not last . And yet , she had never known such happiness , such euphoria . Lovers lived in a special world , where every sense was heightened , and the joy Jennifer felt now with Adam was worth any price she would have to pay later . And she knew she was going to have to pay . Time took on a different dimension . Before , Jennifer 's life had been measured out in hours and meetings with clients . Now her time was counted by the minutes she could spend with Adam . She thought about him when she was with him , and she thought about him when she was away from him . Jennifer had read of men having heart attacks in the arms of their mistresses , and so she put the number of Adam 's personalphysician in her private telephone book by her bedside158 RAGE OF ANGELSso that if anything ever happened it could be handled discreetlyand Adam would not be embarrassed . Jennifer was filled with emotions that she had not known existed in her . She had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do everything for Adam . She wanted to cook for him , to clean for him , to lay out his clothes in the morning . To take care of him . Adam kept a set of clothes at the apartment , and he would spend most nights with Jennifer . She would lie next to him , watching him fall asleep , and she would try to stay awake as long as possible , terrified of losing a moment of their precious time together . Finally , when Jennifer could keep her eyes open no longer , she would snuggle in Adam 's arms and fall asleep , contented and safe . The insomnia that had plagued Jennifer for so long had vanished . Whatever night devils had tormented her had disappeared . When she curled up in Adam 's arms , she was instantly at peace . She enjoyed walking around the apartment in Adam 's shirts , and at night she would wear his pajama top . If she was still in bed in the morning when he left , Jennifer would roll over to his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It seemed that all the popular love songs she heard had been written for Adam and her , and Jennifer thought , Noel Coward was right . It 's amazing how potent cheap music can be . In the beginning , Jennifer had thought that the overwhelmingphysical feeling they had for each other would diminish in time , but instead it grew stronger . She told Adam things about herself that she had never told another human being . With Adam , there were no masks . She was Jennifer Parker , stripped naked , and still he loved her . It was a miracle . And they shared another miracle together : laughter . Impossibly , she loved Adam more each day . She wished that what they had would never end . But she knew it would . SIDNEY SHELDON 159For the first time in her life , she became superstitious . There was a special blend of Kenya coffee that Adam liked . Jennifer bought some every few days . But she bought only one small can at a time . One of Jennifer 's terrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her and that she would not know it until she read about it , or heard about it on a news program . She never told Adam of her fears . Whenever Adam was going to be late he would leave notes for Jennifer around the apartment where she would come upon them unexpectedly . She would find them in the breadboxor in the refrigerator , or in her shoe ; they delighted her , and she saved each one . Their last remaining days together raced by in a blur of joyous activity . Finally , it was the night before Mary BF : a was to return . Jennifer and Adam had dinner in the apartment , listened to music and made love . Jennifer lay awake all night , holding Adam in her arms . Her thoughts were of the happinessthey had shared . The pain would come later . At breakfast , Adam said , " Whatever happens , I want you to know this  --  you 're the only woman I 've ever truly loved . " The pain came then . The anodyne was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had no time to think . She had become the darling of the press , and her courtroomsuccesses were highly publicized . More clients came to her than she could handle , and while Jennifer 's chief interest was in criminal law , at Ken 's urging she began to accept a variety of other cases . Ken Bailey had become more important than ever to Jennifer . He handled the investigations on her cases , and he was brilliant . She was able to discuss other problems with him and she valued his advice . Jennifer and Ken moved again , this time into a large suite of offices on Park Avenue . Jennifer hired two bright young attorneys , Dan Martin and Ted Harris , both from Robert Di Silva 's staff , and two more secretaries . Dan Martin was a former football player from NorthwesternUniversity and he had the appearance of an athlete and the mind of a scholar. 160Ted Harris was a slight , diffident young man who wore thick milk-bottle spectacles and was a genius . Martin and Harris took care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign on the door read : JENNIFER PARKER &; ASSOCIATES . The cases that came into the office ranged from defending a large industrial corporation on a pollution charge to representinga drunk who had suffered whiplash when he was bounced from a tavern . The drunk , of course , was a gift from Father Ryan . " He has a bit of a problem , " Father Ryan told Jennifer . " He 's really a decent family man , but the poor fellow has such pressures that he sometimes takes a drop too much . " Jennifer could not help but smile . As far as Father Ryan was concerned , none of his parishioners was guilty and his only desire was to help them get out of the difficulty they had carelessly gotten themselves into . One reason Jennifer understood the priest so well was that basically she felt the same as he did . They were dealing with people in trouble who had no one to help them , with neither the money nor the power to fight the Establishment , and in the end they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breach . In the courtroom , neither the prosecuting attorney nor the defenseattorney sought justice : The name of the game was to win . From time to time , Jennifer and Father Ryan talked about Connie Garrett , but the subject always left Jennifer depressed . There was an injustice there and it rankled her . In his office in the back room of Tony 's Place , Michael Moretti watched as Nick Vito carefully swept the office with162 RAGE OF ANGELS an electronic device , looking for gypsy taps . Through his police connections , Michael knew that no electronic sur- veillance had been authorized by the authorities , but once in a while an overzealous tin hotdog , a young detective , would set up a gypsy  --  or illegal  --  tap , hoping to pick up infor- mation . Michael was a careful man . His office and home were swept every morning and every evening . He was aware that he was the number one target for half a dozen different law agencies , but he was not concerned . He knew what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing ; and if they did , they could not prove it . Sometimes late at night Michael would look through the peephole of the restaurant 's back door and watch the FBI agents pick up his garbage for analysis , and substitute other garbage for it . One night Nick Vito said , " Jesus , boss , what if the jokers dig up something ? " Michael laughed . " I hope they do . Before they get here we switch our garbage with the restaurant next door . " No , the federal agents were not going to touch him . The Family 's activities were expanding , and Michael had plans that he had not even revealed yet . The only stumbling block was Thomas Colfax . Michael knew he had to get rid of the old lawyer . He needed a fresh young mind . And again and again , his thoughts turned to Jennifer Parker . Adam and Jennifer met for lunch once a week , and it was torture for both of them , for they had no time to be alone together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , using code names . He was Mr. Adams and she was Mrs. Jay . " I hate sneaking around like this , " Adam said . " I do too . " But the thought of losing him terrified her . The courtroom was where Jennifer escaped from her own private pain . The courtroom was a stage , an area where she matched wits against the best that the opposition could offer . Her school was the courtroom and she learned well . A trial was a game played within certain rigid rules , where the better player won , and Jennifer was determined to be the better player . Jennifer 's cross-examinations became theatrical events , with a skilled speed and rhythm and timing . She learned to recognize the leader of a jury and to concentrate on him , knowinghe could swing the others into line . A man 's shoes said something about his character . Jennifer looked for jurors who wore comfortable shoes , because they were inclined to be easygoing . She learned about strategy , the overall plan of a trial , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertat shopping for friendly judges . Jennifer spent endless hours preparing each case , heeding the adage , Most cases are won or lost before the trial begins . She became adept at mnemonics so that she could remember jurors ' names : Smith  --  a muscular man who could handle an anvil ; Helm  --  a man steering a boat ; Newman  --  a newbornbaby . The court usually recessed at four o'clock , and when Jennifer was cross-examining a witness in the late afternoon , she would stall until a few minutes before four and then hit the witness with a verbal blow that would leave a strong overnight impression on the jury . She learned to read body language . When a witness on the stand was lying , there would be telltale gestures : stroking the chin , pressing the lips together , covering the mouth , pulling the earlobes or grooming the hair . Jennifer became an expert at reading those signs , and she would zero in for the kill . Jennifer discovered that being a woman was a disadvantage when it came to practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were still very few women criminal attorneys and some of the male lawyers resented Jennifer . On her briefcaseone day Jennifer found a sticker that read : Women LawyersMake the Best Motions . In retaliation , Cynthia put a sign on her desk that read : A Woman 's Place is in the House .. . and in the Senate . Most juries started out by being prejudiced against Jennifer , for many of the cases she handled were sordid , and there was a tendency to make an association between her and her client . She was expected to dress like Jane Eyre and she refused , but she was careful to dress in such a fashion that she would not arouse the envy of the women jurors , and at the same time appear feminine enough so as not to antagonize the men who might feel she was a lesbian . At one time , Jennifer would have laughed at any of these considerations . But in the courtroom she found them to be stern realities . Because she had entered a man 's world she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the competition . Jennifer learned to prepare thoroughlynot only her own cases , but the cases of her oppositionas well . She would lie in bed at night or sit at the desk in her office and plot her opponent 's strategy . What would she do if she were on the other side ? What surprises would she try to pull ? She was a general , planning both sides of a lethal battle . Cynthia buzzed on the intercom . " There 's a man on line three who wants to talk to you , but he wo n't give his name or tell me what it 's about . " Six months earlier , Cynthia would simply have hung up on the man . Jennifer had taught her never to turn anyone away . " Put him through , " Jennifer said . A moment later she heard a man 's voice ask cautiously , " Is this Jennifer Parker ? " SIDNEY SHELDON 165 " Yes . " He hesitated .  --  Is this a safe line ? " " Yes . What can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's for  --  for a friend of mine . " " I see . What 's your friend 's problem ? " " This has to be in confidence , you understand . " " I understand . " Cynthia walked in and handed Jennifer the mail . " Wait , " Jennifer mouthed . " My friend 's family locked her up in an insane asylum . She 's sane . It 's a conspiracy . The authorities are in on it . " Jennifer was only half-listening now . She braced the telephoneagainst her shoulder while she went through the morning'smail . The man was saying , " She 's rich and her family 's after her money . " Jennifer said , " Go on , " and continued examining the mail . " They 'd probably have me put away , too , if they found Iwas trying to help her . It could be dangerous for me , Miss Parker . " A nut case , Jennifer decided . She said , " I 'm afraid I can'tdo anything , but I 'd suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . " " You do n't understand . They 're all in on it . " " I do understand , " Jennifer said soothingly . " I  --  " " Will you help her ? " " There 's nothing I can  --  I 'll tell you what . Why do n't yougive me your friend 's name and address and if I get a chance , I 'll look into it . " There was a long silence . Finally the man spoke . " This is confidential , remember . " Jennifer wished he would get off the telephone . Her firstappointment was waiting in the reception room . " I 'll remem-ber. " 166 RAGE OF ANGELS " Cooper . Helen Cooper . She had a big estate on Long Island , but they took it away from her . " Obediently , Jennifer made a note on a pad in front of her . " Fine . What sanatorium did you say she was in ?

" Jennifer had talked to Loretta Marshall on the telephone a week earlier . Miss Marshall had asked Jennifer to represent her in a paternity suit against Curtis Randall III , a wealthy socialite . Jennifer had spoken to Ken Bailey . " We need information on Curtis Randall III . He lives in New York , but I under- stand he spends a lot of time in Palm Beach . I want to know what his background is , and if he 's been sleeping with a girl named Loretta Marshall . " She had told Ken the names of the Palm Beach hotels that the woman had given her . Two days later , Ken Bailey had reported back . " It checks out . They spent two weeks together at hotels in Palm Beach , Miami and Atlantic City . Loretta Marshall gave birth to a daughter eight months ago . " Jennifer sat back in her chair and looked at him thought- fully . " It sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so . " " What 's the problem ? " " The problem is our client . She 's slept with everybody in- eluding the Yankees . " " You 're saying that the father of the baby could be any number of men . " " I 'm saying it could be half the world . " " Are any of the others wealthy enough to give child sup-port ? " " Well , the Yankees are pretty rich , but the big league moneyman is Curtis Randall III . " He handed her a long list of names . Loretta Marshall walked into the office . Jennifer had not been sure what to expect . A pretty , empty-headed prostitute , in all probability . But Loretta Marshall was a complete surprise . Not only was she not pretty , she was almost homely . Her figure was ordinary . From the number of Miss Marshall 's romantic conquests , Jennifer had expected nothing less than a sexy raving beauty . Loretta Marshall was the stereotype of an elementary grade schoolteacher . She was clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark blue cardigan and sensible shoes . At first , Jennifer had been sure that Loretta Marshall was planning to use her to force Curtis Randall to pay for the privilege of raising a baby that was not his . After an hour 's conversation with the girl , Jennifer found that her opinion had changed . Loretta Marshall was transparently honest . " Of course , I have no proof that Curtis is Melanie 's father , " she smiled shyly . " Curtis is n't the only man I 've slept with . " " Then what makes you think he 's the father of your child , Miss Marshall ? " " I do n't think . I 'm sure of it . It 's hard to explain , but I even know the night Melanie was conceived . Sometimes a woman can feel those things . " Jennifer studied her , trying to find any sign of guile or deceit . There was none . The girl was totally without pretense . Perhaps , Jennifer thought , men found that part of her charm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes . And Curtis said he loved me . Of course , I 'm not sure he still does , after what 's happened . " 168 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 169 If you loved him , Jennifer wondered , how could you have slept with all those other men ? The answer might have lain in that sad , homely face and plain figure . " Can you help me , Miss Parker ? " Jennifer said cautiously , " Paternity cases are always dif- ficult . I have a list of more than a dozen men you 've slept with in the past year . There are probably others . If I have such a list , you can be sure that Curtis Randall 's attorney will have one . " Loretta Marshall frowned . " What about blood samples , that kind of thing . . . ? " " Blood tests are admissible in evidence only if they prove that the defendant could not be the father . They 're legally inconclusive . " " I do n't really care about me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Curtis should take care of his daughter . " Jennifer hesitated , weighing her decision . She had told Loretta Marshall the truth . Paternity cases were difficult . To say nothing about being messy and unpleasant . The attorneys for the defense would have a field day when they got this woman on the stand . They would bring up a parade of her lovers and , before they were through , they would make her look like a whore . It was not the type of case that Jennifer wanted to become involved in . On the other hand , she be- lieved Loretta Marshall . This was no ordinary gold digger out to gouge an ex-lover . The girl was convinced that Curtis Randall was the father of her child . Jennifer made her deci- sion . " All right , " she said , " we 'll take a crack at it . " Jennifer set up a meeting with Roger Davis , the lawyer representing Curtis Randall . Davis was a partner in a large Wall Street firm and the importance of his position was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was pompous and arrogant , and Jennifer disliked him on sight . " What can I do for you ? " Roger Davis asked . " As I explained on the telephone , I 'm here on behalf of Loretta Marshall . " He looked at her and said impatiently , " So ? " " She 's asked me to institute a paternity suit against Mr. Curtis Randall III . I would prefer not to do that . " " You 'd be a damned fool if you did . " Jennifer held her temper in check . " We do n't wish to drag your client 's name through the courts . As I 'm sure you know , this kind of case always gets nasty . Therefore , we 're prepared to accept a reasonable out-of-court settlement . " Roger Davis gave Jennifer a wintry smile . " I 'm sure you are . Because you have no case . None at all . " " I think we have . " " Miss Parker , I have n't time to mince words . Your client is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves . I have a list of men she 's slept with . It 's as long as my arm . You think my client is going to get hurt ? Your client will be destroyed . She 's a schoolteacher , I believe . Well , when I get through with her she 'll never teach anywhere again as long as she lives . And I 'll tell you something else . Randall believeshe 's the father of that baby . But you 'll never prove it in a million years . " Jennifer sat back , listening , her face expressionless . " Our position is that your client could have become impregnatedby anyone in the Third Army . You want to make a deal ? Fine . I 'll tell you what we 'll do . We 'll buy your client birth-control pills so that it does n't happen again . " Jennifer stood up , her cheeks burning . " Mr. Davis , " she said , " that little speech of yours is going to cost your client half a million dollars . " And Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could turn up nothing against Curtis Randall III . He was a widower , a pillar of170 RAGE OF ANGELS society , and he had had very few sexual flings . " The son of a bitch is a born-again puritan , " Ken Bailey complained . They were seated in the conference room at midnight , the night before the paternity trial was to begin . " I 've talked to one of the attorneys in Davis 's office , Jennifer . They 're going to destroy our client . They 're not bluffing . " " Why are you sticking your neck out for this girl ? " Dan Martin asked . " I 'm not here to judge her sex life , Dan . She believes that Curtis Randall is the father of her baby . I mean , she really believes it . All she wants is money for her daughter  --  nothing for herself . I think she deserves her day in court . " " We 're not thinking about her , " Ken replied . " We 're think- ing about you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think this is a no-win case . It 's going to be a black mark against you . " " Let 's all get some sleep , " Jennifer said . " I 'll see you in court . " The trial went even worse than Ken Bailey had predicted . Jennifer had had Loretta Marshall bring her baby into the courtroom , but now Jennifer wondered if she had not made a tactical error . She sat there , helpless , as Roger Davis brought witness after witness to the stand and forced each of them to admit they had slept with Loretta Marshall . Jennifer did not dare cross-examine them . They were victims , and they were testifying in public only because they had been forced to . All Jennifer could do was sit by while her client 's name was besmirched . She watched the faces of the jurors , and she could read the growing hostility there . Roger Davis was too clever to characterize Loretta Marshall as a whore . He did not have to . The people on the stand did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses to testify to the good work that Loretta Marshall had done as a teacher , to the fact that she attended church regularly and was a good mother ; but all this made no impression in the face of the horrifying array of Loretta Marshall 's lovers . Jennifer had hoped to play on the sympathy of the jury by dramatizing the plight of a young woman who had been betrayed by a wealthy playboy and then abandoned when she had become pregnant . The trial was not working out that way . Curtis Randall III was seated at the defendant 's table . He could have been chosen by a casting director . He was an elegant-looking man in his late fifties , with striking gray hair and tanned , regular features . He came from a social background , belonged to all the right clubs and was wealthy and successful . Jennifer could feel the women on the jury mentallyundressing him . Sure , Jennifer thought . They 're thinking that they 're worthy to go to bed with Mr. Charming , but not that **26;7807;TOOLONG sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately for Loretta Marshall , the child looked nothing like its father . Or its mother , for that matter . It could have belonged to anybody . As though reading Jennifer 's thoughts , Roger Davis said to the jury , " There they sit , ladies and gentlemen , mother and child . Ah ! But whose child ? You 've seen the defendant . I defy anyone in this courtroom to point out one single point of resemblance between the defendant and this infant . Surely , if my client were the father of this child , there would be some sign of it . Something in the eyes , the nose , the chin . Where is that resemblance ? It does n't exist , and for a very simple reason . The defendant is not the father of this child . No , I 'm very much afraid that what we have here is the classic172 RAGE OF ANGELSexample of a loose woman who was careless , got pregnant , and then looked around to see which lover could best afford to pay the bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is here to judge her . What Loretta Marshall chooses to do with her personal life is her own business . The fact that she is a teacher and can influence the minds of small children , well , that is not in my purview , either . I am not here to moralize ; I 'm simply here to protect the interests of an innocent man . " Jennifer studied the jury and she had the sinking feeling that every one of them was on the side of Curtis Randall . Jennifer still believed Loretta Marshall . If only the baby looked like its father ! Roger Davis was right . There was no resemblance at all . And he had made sure the jury was aware of that . Jennifer called Curtis Randall to the stand . She knew that this was her only chance to try to repair the damage that had been done , her final opportunity to turn the case around . She studied the man in the witness chair for a moment . " Have you ever been married , Mr. Randall ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was an instinctive reaction of sympathy from the jury . Damn ! Jennifer moved on quickly . " You never remarried ? " " No . I loved my wife very much , and I  --  " " Did you and your wife have any children ? " " No . Unfortunately , she was not able to . " Jennifer gestured toward the baby . " Then Melanie is your only  --  " " Objection ! " " Sustained . Counsel for the plaintiff knows better than that . " " I 'm sorry , Your Honor . It slipped out . " Jennifer turned back to Curtis Randall . " Do you like children ? " " Yes , very much . " SIDNEY SHELDON 173 " You 're the chairman of the board of your own corporation , are you not , Mr. Randall ? " " Yes . " " Have n't you ever wished for a son to carry on your name ? " " I suppose every man wants that . " " So if Melanie had been born a boy instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judge turned to Jennifer . " Miss Parker , I will ask you again to stop doing that . " " Sorry , Your Honor . " Jennifer turned back to Curtis Randall . " Mr. Randall , are you in the habit of picking up strange women and taking them to hotels ? " Curtis Randall ran his tongue nervously over his lower lip . " No , I am not . " " Is n't it true that you first met Loretta Marshall in a bar and took her to a hotel room ? " His tongue was working at his lips again . " Yes , ma'am , but that was just  --  that was just sex . " Jennifer stared at him . " You say that was just sex ' as though you feel sex is something dirty . " " No , ma'am . " His tongue flicked out again . Jennifer was watching it , fascinated , as it moved across his lips . She was filled with a sudden , wild sense of hope . She knew now what she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she could not push him so hard that the jury would become antagonistic toward her . " How many women have you picked up in bars ? " Roger Davis was on his feet . " Irrelevant , Your Honor . And I object to this line of questioning . The only woman involved in this case is Loretta Marshall . We have already stipulated that the defendant had sexual intercourse with her . Aside from that , his personal life has no relevance in this court-room . " " I disagree , Your Honor . If the defendant is the kind of man who  --  " 174 RAGE OF ANGELS " Sustained . Please discontinue that line of questioning , Miss Parker . " Jennifer shrugged . " Yes , Your Honor . " She turned back to Curtis Randall . " Let 's get back to the night you picked up Loretta Marshall in a bar . What kind of bar was it ? " " I  --  I really do n't know . I 'd never been there before . " " It was a singles bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . " " Well , for your information , the Play Pen was and is a singles bar . It has the reputation of being a pickup place , a rendezvous where men and women go to meet partners they can take to bed . Is n't that why you went there , Mr. Randall ? " Curtis Randall began to lick his lips again . " It  --  it may have been . I do n't remember . " " You do n't remember ? " Jennifer 's voice was weighted with sarcasm . " Do you happen to remember the date on which you first met Loretta Marshall in that bar ? " " No , I do n't . Not exactly . " " Then let me refresh your memory . " Jennifer walked over to the plaintiff 's table and began looking through some papers . She scribbled a note as though she were copying a date and handed it to Ken Bailey . He studied it , a puzzled expression on his face . Jennifer moved back toward the witness box . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of her eye , Jennifer saw Ken Bailey leav- ing the courtroom . " It could have been , I suppose . As I said , I do n't remem- ber . " For the next fifteen minutes , Jennifer went on questioning Curtis Randall . It was a rambling , gentle cross-examination , and Roger Davis did not interrupt , because he saw that Jen- nifer was making no points with the jurors , who were begin- ping to look bored . Jennifer kept talking , keeping an eye out for Ken Bailey . In the middle of a question , Jennifer saw him hurry into the courtroom , carrying a small package . Jennifer turned to the judge . " Your Honor , may I ask for a fifteen-minute recess ? " The judge looked at the clock on the wall . " Since it 's almosttime for lunch , the court will adjourn until one-thirty . " At one-thirty the court was in session again . Jennifer had moved Loretta Marshall to a seat closer to the jury box , with the baby on her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still under oath . You will not have to be sworn in again . Take the stand , please . " Jennifer watched as Curtis Randall sat down in the witness box . She walked up to him and said , " Mr. Randall , how many illegitimate children have you sired ? " Roger Davis was on his feet . " Objection ! This is outrageous , Your Honor . I will not have my client subjected to this kind of humiliation . " The judge said , " Objection sustained . " He turned to Jennifer . " Miss Parker , I have warned you  --  " Jennifer said contritely , " I 'm sorry , Your Honor . " She looked at Curtis Randall and saw that she had accomplishedwhat she had wanted . He was nervously licking his lips . Jennifer turned toward Loretta Marshall and her baby . The baby was busily licking its lips . Jennifer slowly walked over to the baby and stood in front of her a long moment , focusing the attention of the jury . " Look at that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at little Melanie , her pink tongue licking her underlip . Jennifer turned and walked back to the witness box . " And look at this man . " Twelve pairs of eyes turned to focus on Curtis Randall . He sat there nervously licking his underlip , and suddenly the resemblance was unmistakable . Forgotten was the fact that176 RAGE OF ANGELSLoretta Marshall had slept with dozens of other men . Forgottenwas the fact that Curtis Randall was a pillar of the community . " This is a man , " Jennifer said mournfully , " of position and means . A man everyone looks up to . I want to ask you only one question : What kind of man is it who would deny his own child ? " The jury was out less than one hour , returning with a judgmentfor the plaintiff . Loretta Marshall would receive two hundred thousand dollars in cash and two thousand dollars a 1 month for child support . When the verdict came in , Roger Davis strode up to Jennifer , his face flushed with anger . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " Roger Davis hesitated , unsure of himself . " That lip thing . That 's what won the jury over , the baby licking her lips like that . Can you explain it ? " " As a matter of fact , " Jennifer said loftily , " I can . It 's called heredity . " And she walked away . Jennifer and Ken Bailey disposed of the bottle of corn syrup on the way back to the office . Adam Warner had known from almost the beginning that his marriage to Mary Beth had been a mistake . He had been impulsive and idealistic , trying to protect a young girl who seemed lost and vulnerable to the world . He would give anything not to hurt Mary Beth , but Adam was deeply in love with Jennifer . He needed someone to talk to , and he decided on Stewart Needham . Stewart had always been sympathetic . He would understand Adam 's position . The meeting turned out to be quite different from what Adam had planned . As Adam walked into Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've just been on the phone with the election committee . They 're formally asking you to run for the United States Senate . You 'll have the full backing of the party . " " I  --  that 's wonderful , " Adam said . " We have a lot to do , my boy . We have to start organizing things . I 'll set up a fund-raising committee . Here 's where I think we should begin . . . " 16177178 RAGE OF ANGELS SIDNEY SHELDON 179For the next two hours , they discussed plans for the campaign . When they had finished , Adam said , " Stewart , there 's somethingpersonal I 'd like to talk to you about . " " I 'm afraid I 'm late for a client now , Adam . " And Adam had the sudden feeling that Stewart Needham had known what was on Adam 's mind all the while . Adam had a date to meet Jennifer for lunch at a dairy restaurant on the West Side . She was waiting for him in a rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from his expressionJennifer knew that something had happened . " I have some news for you , " Adam told her . " I 've beenasked to run for the United States Senate . " " Oh , Adam ! " Jennifer was filled with a sudden excitement . " That 's wonderful ! You 'll make such a great senator ! " " The competition 's going to be fierce . New York 's a toughstate . " " It does n't matter . No one can stop you . " And Jennifer knew it was true . Adam was intelligent and courageous , willing to fight the battles he believed in . As he had once fought her battle . Jennifer took his hand and said warmly , " I 'm so proud of you , darling . " " Easy , I have n't been elected yet . You 've heard about cups , lips and slips . " " That has nothing to do with my being proud of you . I love you so much , Adam .

" " They want me to announce that I 'm running right away . I 'll have unanimous party backing . " " That 's wonderful ! " There was something that was not wonderful tugging at the back of Jennifer 's mind . It was something she did not want to put into words , but she knew that sooner or later she was going to have to face it . She wanted Adam to win , but the Senate race would be a sword of Damocles hanging over her head . If Adam won , Jennifer would lose him . He would be running on a reform ticket and there would be no margin in his life for any scandal . He was a married man and if it was learned he had a mistress , it would be political suicide .
