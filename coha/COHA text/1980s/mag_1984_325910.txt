Gemayel picks a pro-Syrian <P> In naming Rashid Karami his country 's new Prime Minister last week , Lebanese President Amin Gemayel truly opted for a man with experience : since 1955 Karami , 62 , had held the job nine times . Yet , as accustomed as he is to being Lebanon 's man for all crises , Karami 's tenth try is likely to be the toughest of all . He must form a Cabinet that reflects both the hopes for peace and the desires for power of his country 's warring religious factions . " Let us bury our hatreds and sectarian prejudices , " Karami implored his countrymen after a two-hour meeting with Gemayel . " It is time to set aside the grudges to save Lebanon . " <P> Karami follows Chafik al Wazzan , who resigned in February just before fighting erupted between the Lebanese Army and Muslim militias . The battle almost toppled the Gemayel presidency . It also hastened the departure of the U.S. Marines and brought Lebanon more deeply under Syrian control . The Lebanese Prime Minister is traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Maronite Christian , but Karami met the far more important requirement of enjoying the strong support of Syrian President Hafez Assad . Gemayel made his decision after meeting with the Syrian leader two weeks ago . <P> While Wazzan 's Cabinet had ten members , Karami will select at least 26 ministers in order to accommodate all interests . " The cake will be cut a bit thinner but a bit more equitably this time , " summed up a Muslim politician . Two of Gemayel 's strongest opponents , Druze Chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Shi'ite Leader Nabih Berri , are expected to get important positions , along with the principal Maronite leaders , Pierre Gemaye and Robert Franjieh . Camille Chamoun , the obdurate head of the Christian Lebanese Front , has said he will not serve under Karami , but even he seemed to be showing signs of a change of heart . <P> If Karami succeeds , it will be a victory for the Syrians , who are overseeing a shaky cease-fire in Beirut . The uneasy calm has allowed battle-weary residents to schedule a peace march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . Organizers hope to be able to assemble thousands of people on both sides of the " green line , " which separates predominantly Muslim West Beirut from the Christian eastern sector . The demonstration may make good drama , but it will be up to Karami and his Syrian sponsors to make good the peace .
