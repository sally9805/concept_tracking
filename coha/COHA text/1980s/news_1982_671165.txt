The department also said that it would carry out another inventory of millions of other acres to see if they should be eliminated from consideration as potential wilderness areas . Most of the acreage in both groups is in the West and Southwest. // The ruling by the solicitor ' s office of the Interior Department said that the lands would not automatically be opened to " multiple use , " which could include such things as mining , lumbering or other nonwilderness uses , and that they could someday be considered again for the wilderness system . Some might be considered for other special status , such as scenic areas or historic trails , department officials said. // // Special Protections Removed // But the decision does remove the special protections that prohibited oil and gas drilling and other development in these areas . The decision will take effect unless Congress intervenes or it is blocked by the courts . At least one conservation group , the Sierra Club , said it was considering legal action. // There are now 80 million acres of Federal wilderness lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest Service and 24 million acres managed by the Bureau of Land Management under study as additions to the wilderness system . Congress will decide which of the lands being studied to include in the wilderness system after the Interior Department makes its recommendations. // The department said its ruling was based on decisions by the Interior Department ' s Board of Land Appeals , which questioned the legal qualifications of these lands for inclusion in the wilderness system. // Conservationists said that today ' s ruling was simply the latest example of Interior Secretary James G. Watt ' s hostility to the Federal wilderness system , and contended that the action was deliberately taken after Congress adjourned because Congress had repeatedly demonstrated its determination to protect the Federal wilderness areas. // The solicitor ' s office also ruled today that the Yates Petroleum Corporation could be granted a permit for drilling in the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge ' s Salt Creek Wilderness near Roswell , N.M. The Government is suing the company for beginning drilling operations there without a permit. // The department said it was granting the permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s appropriations bill last week , said that permits could be given for drilling in wilderness areas to companies that had valid existing rights to drill . Yates had such a right from New Mexico , which owned the mineral rights beneath the Federal wilderness. // Congress continued to bar funds for all other drilling in existing wilderness areas and areas being studied as possible additions to the wilderness system . The National Wilderness Act allows drilling in wilderness areas until Dec. 31 , 1983. <> <> 158 Study Areas Involved // Today ' s ruling affects the Bureau of Land Management study areas . Under the ruling , all areas of 5 , 000 or fewer acres will be deleted from further study . These involve 158 study areas totaling 340 , 526 acres in Arizona , California , Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Oregon , Nevada , New Mexico , Utah and Wyoming. // The department is also eliminating from further study 464 , 975 acres where the surface is owned by the Government but the subsurface rights are owned by states , corporations or individuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study areas in the same 10 states except California and Idaho. // The 106 areas total 3. 6 million acres , which the Interior Department said it would re-examine to see if they still qualified as potential wildernesses after the split estate areas were removed. // The department said it would also re-examine wilderness study areas of more than 5 , 000 acres that were contiguous with other Federal lands to see if they should be classified as wildernesses on their own merit instead of being so designated to protect the adjacent lands. // The department offered no acreage figures for this category , but said it involved 70 units in nine Western and Southwestern states . Conservationists said these areas involved more than 1. 5 million acres . <> <> ' Major Impact ' Predicted // Thus , more than 800 , 000 acres will be deleted as wilderness study areas by today ' s action , and up to 5. 1 million other acres could be affected after the new inventory is complete. // John A. McComb , director of the Sierra Club ' s Washington office , termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior Department ' s hostility to the protection of wilderness values , " and predicted that it would have " a major impact on substantial areas. " // Charles M. Clusen , conservation director of the Wilderness Society , a conservation group , said in response to the Interior Department ' s announcement : " Congress had just got done sending Watt a message about leaving our wilderness alone . It is astonishing to me the amount of contempt Watt is showing for Congress by this sneak attack on the wilderness. " // Douglas Baldwin , chief spokesman for Mr. Watt , said that interested members of Congress had been informed in advance of today ' s announcement . But he added that the department did not honor a request by Representative John F. Seiberling , the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Public Parks , that the department defer action on the wilderness study until Congress was in session . The subcommittee is part of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. // " It is our lawyers ' opinion that the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Baldwin said , adding that the department ' s decision had been openly discussed for some time and was the subject of a hearing conducted by Mr. Seiberling earlier this month. //
