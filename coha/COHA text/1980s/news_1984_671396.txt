Then the visitor they awaited arrived , and a new tension rippled through clusters of members and onlookers at the 56-year-old stone church. // He was the Rev. Donald Anderson , the emissary both of his denomination and a county court , bearing a judge ' s order supporting his mission to take control of their church and give substance to the declaration of their Bishop , that the troubled Trinity Lutheran Church no longer exists . <> <> Demand Is Rebuffed // Mr. Anderson strode to the church door , followed after an interval by Allegheny County ' s sheriff , Eugene Coon . Mr. Anderson demanded both the keys to the church and its records . Defiant parishioners barricaded inside rejected the demand . Both then quickly walked away. // Efforts by the Bishop to take control of the church have become a familiar ritual in this town south of Pittsburgh , though never before backed by so much legal authority. // And as it was played out today , many members of the little church were recalling both happier times in their congregation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of larger conflicts - between worker and employer , between the rule of law and the concept of civil disobedience , between different attitudes toward a church ' s social responsibility , between disadvantaged citizens and their Government - that have set neighbor against neighbor here in the valleys of the Monongahela and Ohio rivers . <> <> Rising and Falling With Steel // The church was built here in Clairton , now an old , declining mill town , at a time when , as a former pastor said the other day , " steel was the king in the Mon/Ohio Valley. " // The church grew with the industry , and at its peak in the 1950 ' s it had about 250 members . But like the steel mills that dot the valley , its members aged , and many of their children moved away . By the end of last year , when trouble began to divide the congregation , its membership had fallen to about 145. // The work force had fallen at the mills , too , leaving tens of thousands of former workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former workers that called itself the Network to Save the Mon/ Ohio Valley , an organization that soon found an ally in an equally militant group of clerics , the Denominational Ministry Strategy. // The groups demanded action both by Government and by area corporations to fight unemployment . They focused regional and then national attention on their demands with protests that included " deposits " of fish in bank vaults and demonstrations at the homes and churches of corporate executives. <> <> 90 Boycotted Services // Trinity , with one of the militants as its pastor , became caught up in the conflicts . The pastor , some members say , often preached of corporate " evil " and demanded contributions for his group ' s cause . More than 90 members , most of whom had begun to boycott services and church collections , petitioned the Bishop , Kenneth R. May , for relief. // They said that they were willing to give directly to the needy but not to a militant cause that used their money for what they regarded as propaganda. // The pastor , the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that theirs was a " prophetic ministry , " an Old Testament term for crying out against evil as the biblical prophets did , They said they viewed direct contributions to the needy as purely temporary relief , when what was needed was basic economic changes that would create jobs. // As the old membership of the congregation melted away , several members of the Network to Save the Mon/Ohio Valley joined , leading to charges by Mr. Roth ' s opponents that their church had been " stolen " by the militants . The militant parishioners and their supporters from the network appeared to predominate in one of the churchyard clusters today . <> <> Bishop Suspended Pastor // Bishop May ordered Mr. Roth to desist . When told Mr. Roth had not complied , the Bishop suspended the 33- year-old pastor . And when Mr. Roth refused to quit his duties , Bishop May obtained a court order supporting his command. // Mr. Roth is serving a 90-day jail sentence for defying the court order. // Mr. Roth ' s followers rejected a substitute appointed by the Bishop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop May then declared the church " defunct . " It was that declaration , supported by a court order , that parishioners defied today , backed by militants barricaded with them in the church. // The judge , Emil Narick , later issued an order requiring them to show at a hearing Friday why they should not be held in contempt of court . Those found in contempt could be fined or jailed. // Among those inside was the president of the church council , Wayne Cochran , a retired bus driver , who is one of Mr. Roth ' s admirers . <> <> Two Views of Dispute // " This is a church that lacked the energy to bring in new members , " said Mr. Cochran , reached by telephone there . Old members were " standoffish " when visitors dropped in , he asserted , and he contended that the old membership had been riven by " cliques . " He credited Mr. Roth for igniting an energetic expansion effort. // Members now disaffected , observing the confrontation today from their nearby street corner , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Elaine Rosche , who was " baptized there , confirmed there and married there , " like her two daughters . She recalled " a lot of nice get-togethers " at the church , including covered-dish dinners on frequent social occasions. // Now , she said , the split in the church has put a strain on a longtime friendship with a family that has supported Mr. Roth . " We just try not to talk about the church when we ' re together , " she said . <> <> Former Pastor Remembers // " We were a close-knit congregation , " said Mary Gahagen , though she acknowledged that " we weren ' t in the habit of taking in new members. " // " We were good at helping each other and minding our own business , " she said. // Mr. Roth ' s youthful predecessor as pastor , Frank Terhune , who left in 1977 , remembers Trinity Church as a congregation primarily of the elderly and , he said , " feeling really happy with the way things were going. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone interview from his home in the Poconos . " They reached out into the community and helped the people who needed help. " // " I ' m real concerned about the breakdown in relationships , " he said . " This will be a long time healing , if it ever does. " // //
