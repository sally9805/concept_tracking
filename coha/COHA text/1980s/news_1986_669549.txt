Yet everywhere Governor Graham went that day - among blacks and whites , rich and poor , young and old - one common subject came up : illegal drugs. // From Key West to the Panhandle , Florida voters are concerned , even alarmed , at what is happening to their state because of drugs. // // Crime is multiplying . Young people are getting hooked on crack , a potent form of cocaine . Jails are so swamped that criminals must be put back on the street . Law enforcement officers are growing discouraged . And even in small towns , many streets and neighborhoods are becoming unsafe for law-abiding citizens. // The problem is so pervasive that Orlando police say they can easily make a swing through one of the city ' s drug centers and make 20 arrests . An officer in nearby Brevard County agrees , but adds : ' ' We don ' t have the jail space to put them in. ' ' // The latest crime wave caused by drugs has swept northward from Miami and has now reached Jacksonville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis has spread steadily in this direction , upward along both coasts , and into rural communities in North and Central Florida. // The trigger has been crack . For just $5 , anyone can wander into certain neighborhoods in Titusville or St. Augustine or Melbourne , and buy a ' ' hit. ' ' // Crack has put cocaine , once exclusively the drug of the rich and the famous , within reach of 15-year-old high school students. // All this has escalated the drug crisis to the No. 1 political issue of 1986 , not just in Florida , but across the United States . It ' s a development that has startled politicians who can ordinarily see a major public concern like // this coming far ahead. // A Roper Organization poll found in August that 86 percent of the nation ' s voters consider fighting the drug problem an ' ' extremely important ' ' issue - more than any other concern. // Yet experts warn that even now , the public doesn ' t fully comprehend the seriousness of the drug threat. // Here in Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican incumbent , who is trying to fend off a strong challenge by Democrat Graham. // Senator Hawkins has been in the forefront of the drug issue since she got to Washington in 1981 . She has portrayed drugs as a threat to American children and to the American family. // In her position as chairman of the subcommittee on children , family , drugs , and alcoholism , she has urged mandatory , 20-year sentences for large-scale drug importers , along with expanded powers for the US Customs service to make arrests. // Yet Hawkins has found it difficult to turn her antidrug crusade into a political plus . As rising drug use galvanizes public attention , Democrats and Republicans have fought to outdo one another . Hawkins has found the issue outrunning her positions. // On Thursday , for example , the House voted 392 to 16 ( a measure of the concern over this issue ) to approve a bill that includes imposition of the death penalty in murder cases related to drugs . The House also voted to use military forces to halt drug shipments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Graham has tried to race ahead of Hawkins on the drug issue. // Graham casts the drug crisis in a larger context as another element in a growing threat to the security of America . Asked what the most pressing issue will be for the 100th Congress that meets next January , he responds : // ' ' America must regain control of its borders . Today the problem is illegal drugs and immigrants . Tomorrow it could be terrorists and bombs . We have the capability to secure our borders , but we have lacked the will to do so. ' ' // Neither candidate , however , is likely to get much mileage from a tough approach to drugs , political observers say . In the end , they add , toughness won ' t have too much effect on vote-getting , because such unanimity has developed on the issue . The public simply wants to make sure the candidates take a hard-nosed position. // Hawkins and Graham are reflecting public concerns that escalated rapidly over the summer months. // In Florida , state and local police officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities. // One state investigator , who asked that his name not be used , said crack addiction is spreading at an unprecedented rate . The users come from all walks of life : doctors , lawyers , school teachers , students , the unemployed , blacks , whites , and Hispanics . ' ' There are no boundaries on this thing , ' ' he said. // Lt. James P. Donn , an officer with the Special Investigations Division of the Brevard County Sheriff ' s Office , paints a grim picture of what ' s happening in his area of the state , which includes the Kennedy Space Center. // In every town in Brevard , says Lieutenant Donn , there is now at least one center for drug traffic . Yet most citizens do not realize how pervasive the problem has become. // ' ' There are certain areas of Brevard County that if a family drove into on a Thursday , Friday , or Saturday night , they would come out with a completely different perspective . It would be just an unbelievable experience. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would probably become a victim of that violence . They would probably be confronted with what they would consider a riotous situation in which they would be accosted on the street. ' ' // Anyone going into these ' ' drug zones ' ' is in danger , because ' ' they are entering an area where the street dealers own the territory . They assume that anybody that enters is there to conduct business with them. // ' ' When the dealers confront someone who is out of their element completely , and is taken by surprise , they will seize upon that confusion and try to get personal gain from it . That ' s when the panic occurs and someone gets hurt. ' ' // Public concern has grown as crime has spread outside these drug zones. // Addicts , whose habits can quickly grow from $5-a-day to $100-a-day , turn to burglary , robbery , and other crimes as a source of funds . Residents in both Brevard and Indian River counties have been shocked by a wave of robberies of convenience stores by addicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunned down for no apparent reason at West Cocoa , Merritt Island , and Vero Beach. // Brevard County Sheriff Claude Miller , stunned by the shootings , wonders whether all convenience stores should be closed at dusk. // ' ' We don ' t have the manpower to protect them , ' ' one deputy observes . Sheriff Miller grumbles that the county ' s crime was beginning to resemble New York City or Chicago. // For the politicians , like Hawkins and Graham , it ' s easy to propose broad answers . But the problem is so pervasive that it eludes any short-term solutions. // One thing that has amazed state investigators has been the speed with which the problem has spread. // The original , sophisticated distribution systems for cocaine took years to put in place . They are now established , and apparently are under the control of wealthy , centralized organizations , often with foreign roots. // The crack network , however , sprang up almost overnight . In most areas , it is a local operation . There ' s no ' ' godfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution channels . In many cases , the powdered cocaine is cooked into hard chunks of crack right in the city where it will be sold . It is distributed by these local entrepreneurs to free-wheeling street dealers. // In Brevard County , most of the crack supply comes from the small Haitian community , which has its roots in Miami . Haitians sell the crack to local street dealers ( mostly young , black males ) who peddle it to addicts. // While there are some crack dealers who are white , most white addicts apparently go directly into black neighborhoods to get supplies . This sparks much of the street crime because white doctors , lawyers , teachers , and others unaccustomed to black neighborhoods are inviting targets to the criminal elements dealing in drugs. // Graham , who has run Florida ' s government for the past eight years , calls crack ' ' as great a menace as our society has seen. ' ' // However , Florida ' s law-enforcement officials can do only so much . The crisis may be too big for them. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , Washington may be poised for even more get-tough measures that will almost certainly involve greatly expanded use of the military. // //
