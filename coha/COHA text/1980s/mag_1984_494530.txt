ALL IN THE FAMILY In case all the babies do n't make it clear , the babbling politicians do : the family is back in fashion . But Republicans , who prate about the family and freedom . and Democrats , who pontificate about the family and fairness , have it all wrong ? as any baby or parent could tell them , given the words or the time . Fiction writers have both , and lately a striking number of them have been trying to write about what family life is really like . They do n't evade the trammeled truth : that family relations are distinguished from most other ties precisely in being fundamentally unfree and all too often unfair . Yet this dark heart of domesticity does n't depress these writers . Instead , they seem to be inspired by the household topography , the sticky surfaces and the fenced-off depths ? more modest fictional terrain than the slippery expanse of society or the recesses of the self . Of course , the bourgeois institution of the family has long occupied an important place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally been a place of departure , or else a place of arrival , and rarely the central subject of patient , painstaking observation , as it is in these books . Here social aspirations and private , immoderate dreams play little or no part . These authors rarely move much beyond the confines of well-worn rooms and unwilled relations . Those are n't the highest themes , as George Eliot acknowledged in The Mill on the Floss , one of the great novels about the claims of kinship . Halfway Into her story , she paused , fearing the tame start of her domestic drama might be trying her readers ' patience . She was worried , she told them , that an oppressive feeling may have weighed upon you in watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of the Floss , which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the tragic-comic . It is a sordid life , you say , this of the Tullivers and the Dodsons , ? irradiated by no sublime principles , no romantic visions , no active , self-renouncing faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions which create the dark shadows of misery and crime . . . . Here one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without polish , ? surely the most prosaic form of human life proud respectability in a gig of unfashionable build , worldliness without side dishes . A century later , Dwight Macdonald also remarked on the constricted canvas of family life in an essay about one classic American portrait , James Agee 's A Death in the Family . The love that is the subject of the book , he noted , is not sexual , not even romantic ; it is domestic ? between husband , wife , children , aunts , uncles , grandparents . This love is described tenderly , not in the tough , now-it-can-be-told style dominant in our fiction since Dreiser . The negative aspects are not passed over ? Agee is , after all , a serious writer ? but what he dwells on , what he " celebrates , " is the positive affection that Tolstoy presented in " Family Happiness " but that now is usually dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems odder now , when even the women 's magazines are apt to be impatient with old-fashioned family themes , that so many writers should unapologetically pick them up ? so many that E. L. Doctorow , in a blurb for Jayne Anne Phillips 's book , suggested that " truly rendered family life may now be the presiding virtue of the American novel . " This year 's family portraitists rank as " serious " authors ; Jayne Anne Phillips and Robb Forman Dew , both now on their second books , were highly praised for their first ones ; and David Leavitt and Josephine Humphreys are following suit with unusually successful debuts . None of them ignores the negative aspects of family life , which have become more various and voguish than Eliot 's Tullivers or Agee 's Follets would have dreamed ; they deal with affairs , fights , silences , drink , some drugs , separations , divorce , and death . Yet such struggles for personal liberation and enlightenment do n't seem to be these authors ' central interest . Instead , they are mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , or full understanding of , the bonds of blood . It 's not easy to dramatize the elusive yet inescapable power of family ties . For compared to our directed lives as individuals or citizens ? where we 're guided , and goaded , by rights and duties and choices ? our experience as members of families is a muddled affair . The pull of blood and time prevails , and we swim along , from day to day and generation to generation , aspiring to endurance rather than transcendence . ( Children , instead of immutable achievements , are the legacies that average families leave . ) Sometimes the going is smooth , sometimes not , but always present is an awareness of the constant passage of time and the constraints on the will . That sense is humbling , as Leslie Farber , a psychoanalyst and social critic , explained in a rare essay on the distinctive feel of family life . We want : to have lived honorably , to have mattered ? to our time and to one another , to have had a meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potatoes are burning and the gas man is here to read the meter . What family life teaches us about time is that it goes ? that what it brings or gives or permits , it also transforms or hardens or takes away . We learn that family life is a passionate daily traffic in perishables , and that what endures , in joy or grief , is seldom what we knew or chose . In literature , those lessons do n't always make for taut plots and commanding characters . These are humble books for the most part ; there are no dramatic story lines and no driven heroes or heroines . Yet the authors do manage to build , and then sustain , the slow momentum suited to the shapeless stretches of time they chronicle ; and their characters , though not outwardly engaged and energetic , are stubborn and unexpectedly resilient , Having abandoned romance , these writers at their best are ambitiously faithful to recalcitrant , prosaic reality . ABOVE all , they aim to address their imaginations to one invisible and invincible fact of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their characters must accommodate their wills . Jayne Anne Phillips 's Machine Dreams spans the longest stretch of years , more than four decades and three generations of a family . Opening with a mother 's reminiscence to a daughter , the narrative then alternates among all four members of the family ? Jean and Danner Hampson , the mother and daughter ; Mitch and Billy , the husband and son . Some of their accounts are in the first person and sound like snippets of a slowly accumulating oral history of family life in small-town America , where jobs and marriages get ever less dependable . Others are presented in the third person and unroll like reels in a home movie that can capture the movements of minds and hearts as well as limbs . All but two of the sections are labeled and limited by a date . Within the frozen frames , however , the emphasis is on the fluidity of days , years , generations . In this novel , as in the others , the sexes seem to navigate time 's currents differently , and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are easily and radically disoriented by the " daily traffic in perishables " ; the women seem to feel the rhythm of flux is less foreign , though still frightening . Both Jean and Danner are unnerved by the falling off from the past that their lives in Bellington bring . " Pointless , really , a lot of what happened , " Jean muses . Did n't people have to do more than just endure ? Did n't they have to be smart , as well , and know what things meant ? Oh , she compared everyone to her mother : maybe that was what scared her . God , did she hate it ? her mother 's strength ? It was what she loved most and what she hated . Danner inherits the dilemma . But like her mother , who plans while Mitch founders and who finally divorces him when the kids go to college , Danner struggles to take her life in hand . And she tries to rally her brother Billy , whose inclination , not unlike his father 's , is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes obsessed by civil defense in the early 1960s , sure the end is near . For Billy , it 's the prospect of the draft in the late 1960s that suspends his will ; he drops out of college , explaining to his sister who urges him to see a draft counsellor , " You do n't reason through these things . The best way to be lucky is to take what comes and not be a coward . . . . I 'm going to go . It 's in the cards . " Billy , predictably , is n't lucky , and his family is devastated by proof that it is powerless against such intrusions of public history . Yet Danner 's rage at what seems to be willful governmental negligence is the least successful part of Phillips 's saga . Much more compelling is the sense of the family 's inescapable , if far from all-powerful , presence in its members ' lives . " If I hated my government , should n't I go and live in some other country ? " Danner asks herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly comes from the heart . " But my parents are my country , my divided country . . . . I 'd never leave my country . 1 never will . " Phillips , moved by strong memories , has mapped that country down to its silent moments , making us hear , with Danner , " the house settle , a nearly inaudible creaking , ghostly clicking of the empty furnace pipes ; her mother , her father , walking the halls in slippers . " The political history that Phillips tries with mixed success to introduce into the foreground of her novel is barely even a background murmur in the other books . There 's talk of nuclear danger in the Missouri town where Robb Forman Dew 's The Time of Her Lift ' is set , and softer mention of urban racial tensions in the Charleston of Josephine Humphreys 's Dreams of Sleep . But the Parkses and the Reeses , the families portrayed in each , do n't have the energy to worry about threats on that scale . The secure , stable lives they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much closer to hand . The immediate source of disruption in both books ( which have the uncanny resemblance sisters sometimes have ) is a husband 's affair . The scope of these novels , compared to Machine Dreams , is small . Robb Forman Dew chronicles a fall and winter , whose slow passage is punctuated by two far from festive feasts at Thanksgiving and Christmas . Josephine Humphreys 's narrative centers on the precipitate end of a well-established affair . The focus is on couples more than whole clans ( the daughter in Dew 's novel is " loved . . . as the third one among the three of them , " a peripheral status that is essential to the plot ) . But marriage bonds seem to be almost as much a matter of fate as blood ties are ; both Dew and Humphreys downplay the role of choice in linking husband and wife . Claudia and Avery Parks , who have known each other since their days in the sandbox , feel the instinctive sympathy of close siblings . " She had always been with Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world without the other . " The link between Will and Alice Reese , also acquaintances from youth , has surprisingly similar roots in the past . Her mother made his mother 's wedding dress , and Alice wonders , Was that coincidence , that their mothers came together then ? Or when Elizabeth 's steel scissors cut into the thick creamy satin for Marcella 's gown , were forces set that would gather strength and eventually join the children of those two women ? Time has had a hand in tying both couples together , but it is also what tests the strength of their connection . As in Machine Dreams , the men here lose their temporal bearings more abruptly . Will , a gynecologist in his 30s and Humphreys 's most fully imagined character , had wanted a family . Unmarried and childless he was loose in time , fatherless , mother-threatened . After he got his family , his sense of orientation and stability improved , but at times now , and increasingly often , a new , dizzying suspicion grabs him and spins him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will round his corner one day and there will he no house ; and worse , that he will he glad to see it gone . Spooked by all the melancholy women around him ? by his patients , who are past eagerly bearing babies and " starting to spot and clot , they 're scared " ; by the " old sad ghost of the thing that used to be " between him and his wife ? he finds some solace in an affair with his assistant . Fighting similar fears , Avery Parks leaves home to escape what he perceives as his wife 's " nihilism . " He turns to his daughter 's drab but determined violin teacher , who helps shore up his sense that there can be purpose in his life and progress in his work . The wives of these two men have succumbed to what Avery and Will are trying to escape : the aimless flow of time . In stark contrast to the energetic women in Phillips 's novel , Claudia Parks and Alice Reese are eerie portraits in passivity . Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings , nights , with only a general , pessimistic sense of what lies ahead . As well as making an ironic comment on a particularly unhappy phase in the Parks 's life , Dew 's title simply states the preoccupation of Claudia 's existence : the ticking away of time . " I do work hard at the days . I work hard to make the days go by , " Claudia thinks to herself , and Dew goes on to explain her outlook this way : She really did believe it , too . She was quite certain that in her life there was a connection between the passing of time and her need for it to pass . During any of the days when the pall of Avery 's rage or drunkenness hung over the hours , she had the stray notion in the back of her mind that all the dreary hours would pass them by . She had the idea that they were going through something and would one day get to something else . If she had not thought she could force the pace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . Throughout Avery 's absence , she lapses into even greater lassitude , drifting around the house and her daughter Jane like a disembodied phantom : " she had not even settled into a state of waiting since Avery left ; she was only being there until the time went by . " Alice Reese is almost as lethargic . She is barely able to keep up the routine motions of motherhood around her two small daughters , much less the more urgent gestures of a wife in trouble . The best she can do is hire a baby-sitter to introduce a purposeful presence into her house , a girl who moves the way Alice would like to move , for example , if she had a mind to win her husband back . If she really wanted to make the effort ; but she does not . It would he too much trouble , it would take too much energy . She has none . But beneath the hopelessness , she , like Claudia , does have a steady faith in the continuity of things . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their husbands return , the burdens of family life proving , finally , more a welcome anchor than a deadweight . There 's a touch of facile sentimentality at the close of both novels ? all the more striking after the fastidious realism . Yet Dew and Humphreys do n't let their characters off that easily . Everyone is not going to live happily ever after , and it 's children ? the Parks 's 11year-old daughter Jane and 17-year-old Iris Moon , the Reese 's baby-sitter -- who seem to have the most suffering in store . They 're both disconcertingly ageless , unconventional girls , with a de tached perspective on the ways and weight of family life ? more adult in most ways than Alice and Claudia . Unlike the grown-ups who finally embrace the unromantic " family happiness " of Tolstoy 's story and feel liberated by it , the girls have a sense of imprisonment . Alice mulls optimistically that " in the long run all this lassitude may prove to be peace in a kind of disguise , and all this despair turn out to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future does n't look so rosy ; the Reeses may be on the mend , but she breaks down amid her own already shattered family ? her mother had her at 15 , and her father deserted them ? and her dreams of an escape evaporate . And as Claudia and Avery Parks are rediscovering their indissoluble bond in the darkness of Christmas night , Jane is " heartbroken with the hopelessness of loving Avery and Claudia so much for all her life , the energy it would require , the fatigue it would cause . " C OMPARED to the temporary marital woes in Dew 's and Humphreys 's novels , the family troubles in David Leavitt 's collection of stories look more traumatic . Homosexuality , cancer , and divorce haunt the mothers , fathers , and children in Family Dancing . Yet despite the scale of difficulties ? and the extent of attention the book received among gays ( Christopher Street put Leavitt on its cover , proclaiming " A Writer is Born " ) ? what is most striking about this collection is the familiarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transitory ties and alien routines of gay life , Leavitt appears to be more interested in the tangled , interminable relations of conventional family life . The underlying dilemmas ? the tug of time , the unchosen claims of blood ? are the same , and as strong as ever . The opening story , " Territory , " is a standard tale with a gay twist ? son brings lover home to meet his parents . Leavitt 's unfamiliar slant does n't just save the story from being a stock scenario ; it calls attention to the real tension in the **27;2899;TOOLONG plot ? the deep discomfort caused when a child confronts parents with his power of emotional and sexual choice , a power foreign to family life . Home in California for a visit , Neil has invited his lover Wayne , " the only person he has ever imagined he could spend his life with , " to fly out and meet his mother . She is , of course , the person he 's already spent a lot of life with , and Neil struggles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his impatience to proceed with his own life . On the flight back after the visit , which has been a well-paced mixture of missed cues and successful moments , Neil tries to explain the anxious empathy between him and his mother : " The scariest thing in the world is the thought that you could unknowingly ruin someone 's life , " Neil tells Wayne . " Or even change someone 's life . I hate the thought of having that much control . I 'd make a rotten mother . " Like the other authors , Leavitt knows that the kind of control at work in families is unwitting rather than willful ? not so different from fate . In " The Lost Cottage " and " Family Dancing " Leavitt stages the most intricate , awkward family reunions in the collection , and homosexuality recedes into the background . The theme of both is how hard it can be for families to adapt to changes in their midst . Suzanne and Lynette Kaplan , mother and daughter in " Family Dancing , " have shakily watched allegiances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , however , both are unable to escape their preoccupation with their place ? or rather , lack of place ? in the affections of Herb Kaplan , ex-husband and father . The Dempsons in " Lost Cottage " have been gingerly trying to adjust to divorce , but they too come up against stubborn sentiment . " The whole business is so simple it 's embarrassing , " Lydia explains to her grown children , who have gathered with her and their father , her ex-husband Alex . " . . I love your father , and I always will love your father . And he does n't love me . And never will . " And then she turns to Alex : " ' Did you hear me ? ' she says . ' I love you . You can escape me , but you can never escape that . ' " Yet it 's precisely the inflexibility of family feeling which makes the family peculiarly well suited to adapting to the most unsettling force of all ? time . Leavitt explores that reflexive resilience in " Counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mothers faced with the prospect of untimely death . Mrs. Harrington , sitting in her oncologist 's waiting room , is suddenly and profoundly disoriented . She was reading a Shake ' n ' Bake ad , thinking about the chicken waiting to he cooked in the refrigerator at home , and whether she would broil it ; she was tense . She began to consider the date , December 17 : Who was born on December 17 ? Did anything historic happen on December 17 ? Then , through some untraceable process , that date ? December 17 ? infected her with all the horror of memory and death . For today was the day she was supposed to be dead by . She carries on , of course ; she goes home and melts butter in the saucepan for basting , wipes her sniveling son 's nose , patient with , but also appalled by , the mundane march of time .

She would apologize and dinner would be fine . . . . But looking at herself in the mirror , she remembered the rebellious girl she had once been , and she was only sorry she could not find it in herself to be courageous . " Rebellious courage is certainly not a staple of family life as depicted in these hooks , though it may play a part in the visions of those who urge the family to champion fairness and freedom . But neither is the family merely a refuge , a haven in a heartless world . Rather it is , as this fiction makes plain , a way into close , certain contact with reality . Alice Reese thinks of the family as a pact that guarantees access to prosaic facts : " She had made a deal for the real world ! That 's what the marriage was for .

They do n't expect a dream man ( or woman ) . They know they ca n't choose their children ( and their children are similarly , often prematurely , wise ) . They 're resigned to the fact that the wedding dress satin slips by the wayside , and the fabric of life gets drabber yet also more durable as time passes . It 's not that they 're complacent , or too ready to compromise , although at times they are both . It 's more that , as Humphreys writes , " they crave what 's found in pain and loss : a sense of living among other human beings . "
