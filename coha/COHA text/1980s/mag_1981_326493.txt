Lady Justice <P> To the Editors : <P> Hallelujah ! A campaign promise that was actually fulfilled-and brilliantly July 20 . Sandra O'Connor 's expertise , sharp intellect and experience qualify her for a seat on the Supreme Court regardless of her sex . <P> Anita Moore Florissant , Mo . <P> Justice-at last ? A woman member of the Supreme Court is not synonymous with justice . <P> Robert L. Shaw Washington , D.C. <P> <P> In Uruguay we also try to move forward in women 's matters , but not with so much fanfare . Our government recently appointed the first woman judge to the Uruguayan Supreme Court and the first woman dean of our major university . The news media dutifully reported these events , but they did not steal the national headlines . <P> Juan Garcia Montevideo <P> Whether Sandra O'Connor is , or is not , an advocate of the ERA is a moot point . Her nomination to the Supreme Court verifies that the ERA is unnecessary . <P> Chet S. Kaczka <P> Phoenix <P> Only in the future can we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But certainly others who prefer a different candidate should be able to express their preference without being savaged and ridiculed in the media or by a U.S. Senator . <P> Patricia Kennedy Bergheiser Bellmore , N. Y. <P> In your article " Foot Soldiers of the Law " July 20 you stated no woman has ever been elected president of a state bar . On June 20 , 1981 , the Rhode Island State Bar Association named Beverly Glenn Long as president . She is the fourth woman to hold such a position . In 1977-78 , Carole Kamin Bellows was president of the Illinois State Bar . Alaska has had Donna Willard , while Karen L. Hunt is currently occupying the office . <P> Nanci Martin Warwick , R.I. <P> As a feminist , I am pleased that Ronald Reagan nominated Sandra O'Connor for the Supreme Court . As a pessimist , I fear that he will continue to ignore other women 's issues . He will reason that he has now " done something " and does n't have to do anything more . <P> Cathy Richardson Mount Pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with any female appointed to the judiciary . Obviously a woman who respects " traditional family values " would not have gone to law school or sought a career outside the home . <P> Sheila S. Walker Leadville , Colo . <P> <P> England 's Nights of Rage <P> Those who are so quick to blame Prime Minister Thatcher and her tight-fisted monetary policies for England 's urban riots July 20 forget that America 's riots in the ' 60s took place during the spending spree of Lyndon Baines Johnson , author of the Great Society . <P> Franklyn Alexander Evanston , Ill . <P> With an uncaring right and an impotent left , where can the poor people of my onetime home town , Liverpool , go but to the streets to express their frustration and anger . <P> Mitzi F. Sandiford Vienna , Va . <P> Your story on Britain 's summer of discontent fails to mention a key triggering element . Britain 's frustrated lower classes have had a bellyful of exposure to overweening privilege , particularly during this time of a spectacle wedding . <P> Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
