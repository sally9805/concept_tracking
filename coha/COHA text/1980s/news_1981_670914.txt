The prosecutor said that Mr. Crimmins , a 22-year-old former stagehand at the opera house , had told the police this happened after a chance encounter with the violinst , Helen Hagnes Mintiks , on a backstage elevator , during which Miss Hagnes slapped him. // The description by Assistant District Attorney Roger S. Hayes during his opening statement to the jury in State Supreme Court provided the first official details of what Mr. Crimmins is said to have confessed to the police prior to his formal booking on the morning of Aug. 30 . All along , the defense lawyers have contended that detectives used " psychological threats " to force their client to make the incriminating statements. // The discovery of the 31-year-old freelance violinist ' s body on a beam in an airshaft behind the opera house led detectives on the most extensive murder investigation in recent city history. // According to Mr. Hayes ' s reconstruction of the killing on the evening of July 23 , Miss Hagnes left the orchestra pit around 9 : 30 P.M. and was to be free until 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to try to speak to Mr. Panov about arranging a meeting with her husband , " he said. // Valery Panov , the Russian emigre choreographer and dancer , was the guest star of the show . Miss Hagnes ' s husband , Janis Mintiks , is a sculptor. // When she entered a backstage elevator , No. 12 , Mr. Hayes said , " the defendant also got on it with her , as did a third person , Laura Cutler. " // Miss Cutler is an American dancer in the company of the Berlin troupe . Mr. Hayes said that the violinist asked Miss Cutler , " Where is Mr. Panov ' s dressing room ? " and that Mr. Crimmins answered , " on three . " At first the elevator went down to C-level , the last of 10 floors in the opera house , the prosecutor said , and there Miss Cutler left Mr. Crimmins and Miss Hagnes in the elevator. // Then , Mr. Hayes said , this happened : " Craig Crimmins said something to Helen Hagnes Mintiks . She slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // At that point , according to Mr. Hayes ' s account , Mr. Crimmins took the woman from the elevator on the second floor and down a stairwell to an area several flights below . There , the prosecutor said , Mr. Crimmins forced Miss Hagnes to remove a tampon that she was using and " he attempted to rape her for five minutes . " When she tried to escape , he said , Mr. Crimmins caught her and pushed her up the stairwell to the sixth floor. // Once on the roof , Mr. Hayes said , the defendant tied her hands and feet and began to leave , but noticed that her feet were loose . Miss Hagnes again tried to flee but was once more caught , Mr. Hayes related. // The defendant retied her feet , the prosecutor continued , " and she started to talk to him , asking him if he worked at the opera house . " To quiet her , Mr. Hayes said , Mr. Crimmins " gagged her , " stuffing one napkin in her mouth and tieing a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her stomach and cut off her clothes. " // As the defendant was leaving , the prosecutor went on , he heard the violinist " make a noise . " " And that is when it happened , " Mr. Hayes said . " He went back and kicked her over the ventilation shaft . " <> <> Death Caused by Fall // A medical examiner has determined that Miss Hagnes died after she was thrown from the sixth-floor roof onto the steel beam . The opera house has 10 floors . The main floor , on which performances are held , is the stage level . Below that are three floors , designated A , B and C levels . Above the stage are floors numbered one through six. // From the stairwell exit onto the sixth floor , one must climb up a short ladder to a door that leads to the roof , where six large fans are used in the cooling system for the opera house . Each of the fans sits atop a ventilation shaft. // As Mr. Hayes described the murder route , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to C-level , then back up the stairs to the roof. // Lawrence Hochheiser , one of Mr. Crimmins ' s lawyers , did not dispute Mr. Hayes ' s version of the murder , calling it " very interesting , to say the least , and shocking to hear. " // Instead Mr. Hochheiser described how the police were under " tremendous pressure and were receiving demands from their superiors and public demands for a solution to the case . " Referring to his client as " the boy " or " the kid , " Mr. Hochheiser said that he had an I.Q. of 83 . Experts have said that a person with such an intellegence rating is slow but not in the retarded range . <> <> Defendant Called ' Pliable ' // In the defendant , Mr. Hochheiser said , the police found " a particularly pliable subject " who " has particular problems concerning adults and authority figures " and who often " takes the easy way out of situations involving verbal pressures. " // Mr. Hochheiser repeated his contention that detectives had put words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken since he began representing the stagehand last September . " If you say that X happened and that he has simply forgotten , he is more willing to accept that position than the next person , " the lawyer said. // Mr. Hochheiser told the jury that he would prove that the police had deliberately thwarted the family ' s plan to obtain a lawyer for Mr. Crimmins should he be questioned by the police . He was interrogated for more than 15 hours on the evening of Aug. 16 and morning of Aug. 17 , before being picked up for further questioning on the evening of Aug. 29 . It was at the end of six hours of inquiries that Mr. Crimmins is said to have admitted guilt . Later a videotape was made , with Assistant District Attorney Charles J. Heffernan Jr. posing a series of questions to him. // " He never never did anything , " Mr. Hochheiser said . " He never killed anybody . He didn ' t rape anybody . " He couldn ' t have told Detective Giorgio anything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he didn ' t know anything . This young man is entirely innocent , " he said , referring to a detective and an assistant district attorney who had interrogated the suspect. // Before testimony ended for the day , Mr. Hayes called to the witness stand the husband of the murder victim to identify her shoes and a black ballpoint pen that she had been carrying . Four fellow musicians were also called . They said they had noticed Miss Hagnes ' s absence after the intermission and had searched for her after the final curtain call . The trial continues tomorrow before Acting Justice Richard O. Denzer. //
