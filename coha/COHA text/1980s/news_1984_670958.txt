Though clearly justified , those demands fail , in the view of some experts , to get at the roots of the problem . They deal with an epidemic without looking for the bacteria causing it. // The crisis is evident . In the case of the Praca Day Care Center in the Bronx , initially involving allegations of the abuse of 39 children , including rape of a 4-year-old girl , six employees have been arrested. // Charges involving the Virginia McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach , Calif. , alleging abuse of 100 children over a period of years , have led to seven indictments. // In Chicago , charges have been made against a janitor and two teachers in a private child-care center. // In Alabama , the entire staff of a children ' s facility has been dismissed on similar charges. // In Reno , charges against the owner of a private preschool center are under investigation. // Clearly , these incidents can no longer be viewed as aberrations . Punishment and a cleanup of the institutions are essential first steps . But child-care experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country ' s refusal to look at the development and education of children as a continuum that should begin as soon as children require care outside the home , care that should , therefore , be carefully regulated and supervised. // // Children , experts say , have become victims of ideologues who look at the world as they would like it to be , not as it really is. // Helen Blank , director of child care at the Children ' s Defense Fund , recalled that after President Nixon vetoed the Child Development Act in 1972 , conservatives cheered , saying that mothers should stay home to take care of their children . The facts , Miss Blank said , are that mothers do work , and their children do need care . After a while , she added , people were no longer scared to raise the issue , but they still could not raise the money. // " The problem with child care today , " she said , " is that it has no structure . It ' s a patchwork. " // Elinor Guggenheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that change is overdue . " We have had a social revolution. and our country has failed to recognize this , " she said. // In the United States , 8. 9 million children under 6 years of age have mothers who work ; 60 percent of the mothers work full time. // Tax credits for child care , totaling about $2 billion annually , help some parents , but they do little to improve facilities or their management. // About 15 percent to 18 percent of the $2. 7 billion in Federal block grants for social services are available for day care . But that subsidy , after cuts by the Reagan Administration , totals only $200 million more than in 1976. // Miss Blank said day-care workers generally are poorly paid . And often they get little support and even less status. // For a brief period in the 1960 ' s , when a wave of social consciousness washed over the country , early childhood and preschool education were given attention . Leading educators paid attention to the connection between the social and intellectual care given even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and politicians to take an interest in child care. // President Johnson translated such concern into Project Head Start for children aged 4 and 5 , and that successful program has survived . It now has an appropriation of $1 billion and has escaped major scandals , probably because it operates under Federal standards. // Such standards are lacking in many child-care centers . In New York , centers are licensed under the health code . But Nancy Wackstein , staff assistant for child welfare at the Citizens Committee for Children , said that monitoring deals largely with fiscal matters . Moreover , teacher aides are not licensed. // // Until now , laws did not allow the centers to check candidates for criminal records , giving children less protection than taxi riders . Teacher aides , whose qualification is that they read at least on an eighth-grade level , are paid $11 , 900 a year . Teacher salaries range from $12 , 450 for those with a high school diploma to $15 , 705 for a master ' s degree and state certification. // Many educators are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since the Child Development Act was vetoed , " said Albert Shanker , president of the American Federation of Teachers . He recalled " a big fight " in 1975 over the public schools ' role in child care as New York ' s school chancellors , Frank Macchiarola and Anthony J. Alvarado , tried unsuccessfully to get schools to assume some responsibility. // Many community organizations , fight against any role by the schools , Mr. Shanker said . " They want no rules , but some are now coming around , " he added. // More people are beginning to believe that children would be better off " under some stable American institution , " Mr. Shanker said. // Consultants of New York ' s Agency for Child Development , part of the Human Resources Administration , which is responsible for supervision of day care , report on conditions in the field . But Miss Wackstein said that there were too few consultants , one for every 25 centers , and that the consultants pay little attention to programs. // This points to the basic flaw in day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bridge between home and school . While conservative commentators growl about family duty , the economic and cultural facts of modern society make the care of young children outside the home a necessity . It could open up opportunities to give all children a head start. // This should not mean pushing them too early into learning basic skills at the expense of a carefree childhood . But neither should it be viewed as mindless " storage. " // It is unfortunate it took the abhorrent news of abuse to put the spotlight on the inadequacy of the entire jerrybuilt structure of child care. //
