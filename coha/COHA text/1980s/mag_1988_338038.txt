Thirty years ago , William F. Buckley Jr . was widely viewed as a reactionary young fogy . Ten years later his critics were content to see him as a leading spokesman for conservatism and a worthy opponent . Today the editor of the National Review , TV host , columnist , lecturer , spy novelist and yachtsman is an Establishment celebrity admired for his charm but reproached for his unbearable lightness of being . <P> If Buckley worries about his public persona , he does not show it . Snook cocked , polysyllables bristling , he goads his critics by making everything he does look easy or , even more rankling , look like fun . There is a price . His books sometimes show signs of having been written with one eye on an in-flight movie . His syndicated column occasionally follows the hasty recipe , ad hominem , mix and half-bake . Yet he possesses genuine literary gifts and first- strike verbal capabilities that are devastating in debate . <P> The Buckley that emerges from John Judis ' equitable biography is a versatile though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two fixed points : his Roman Catholic faith and his anti-Communist passion . Understanding his motives and drives , however , requires some adjustment . Most liberals consider Buckley a member of the privileged class . But as Judis describes him , Buckley sees himself as an outsider and counterrevolutionary battling entrenched atheism , collectivism and moral relativism . <P> He started early . At age seven , in 1932 , he wrote King George to demand that Britain pay its war debts . He named his first sailboat Sweet Isolation . After Stateside service in the Army during World War II , Buckley went to Yale , where he used the rostrum and the columns of the university paper to crusade against liberalism . He formalized his quarrels in God and Man at Yale and became an unexpected best-selling author in 1951 . <P> Judis provides useful insights into Buckley 's conservative lineage . One early influence , Albert Jay Nock , an anarchist and enemy of mass culture , had visions of an intellectual elite he called the Remnant . Another , Yale Political Scientist Willmoore Kendall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over individual rights . A loathing of the left had already been passed on to Buckley by his father Will , a Texas-born oilman who made a fortune in Mexico , only to have most of his property there seized in the years after the 1910 revolution . <P> By the time Buckley founded the National Review in 1955 , he had abandoned ambitions to be a political philosopher . The long scholarly pull did not suit his polemical talents and gregarious nature . His friend Literary Critic Hugh Kenner put the matter concisely when he said that Buckley " was simply moving too fast to think , by which I mean that thought had become reflex . " <P> Judis , an editor at the leftward newsmagazine In These Times , fosters this and like assessments without endorsing them . He is more definite in his conclusion : since conservatism triumphed with the election of his pal Ronald Reagan , Buckley has lost his competitive urge . The last lap of the 20th century may provide a new liberal challenger , but until then we are left with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House at about the same time that Buckley , the political activist , began changing into an entertainer .
