The Royals tried to palm off the blame by firing Jim Frey , and they were lucky that this season rewarded those who played well for four or five weeks . But all you have to know about KC is that U.L. Washington threw a tantrum over an official scorer ' s call after the first game of the Oakland series . That shows where that club ' s collective head was . What the A ' s did to theRoyals was nothing but justice . Kansas City had been rewarded with playoff money for having the 11th-best record in the league . What the Royal players have done to themselves in the last year is a sad story . George Brett is a great player and a hell of a guy , but he didn ' t play like it this year . Except for Larry Gura , Dennis Leonard and Dan Quisenberry , none of them did , and now the Royals ' management faces the music of making some major changes . Word is they may trade Willie Mays Aikens and move Brett to first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Hal McRae may be traded and perhaps Washington , too , if they think Onix Concepcion can take over the shortstop job . Until Dickie Noles threw at Brett ' s head , this was a team on a roll ; now , it ' s a team rolled , worried not about winning , but official scorers ' decisions . The shakeup will not be easy because Kansas City has not had depth for two years . They need pitching , catching ( when youngster Don Slaught broke his leg , it set them back ) , at least one outfielder and possibly a third baseman should Brett move . But it has to be done because evidence of decay is showing everywhere. - Last week ' s note updating Fred Lynn ' s lifetime average in ( .348 ) and out ( .263 ) of Fenway Park prompted a few letters requesting the lifetime Fenway and non-Fenway averages of some other locals . Carl Yastrzemski ' s numbers in 5540 at-bats in Fenway are .308-224-992 , and , in 5429 at-bats in all the other parks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenway , .286-85-307 on the road . Dwight Evans is .283-91-302 in 1856 at-bats in Fenway , .248-59-212 in 1950 on the road . And , finally , in his 241 at-bats in Fenway , Carney Lansford is .344-4-39 , in 1934 at-bats elsewhere is .283-45- 235 . . . Henry Aaron reportedly stepped into the Atlanta situation and has plugged Richmond manager Eddie Haas so strongly - " He knows as much baseball as anyone I ' ve ever met , " says Aaron - that the Braves apparently are going to hire him after 28 years in the organization . That doesn ' t make Ted Turner too unhappy because it saves him a lot of money by not having to sign Dick Williams . Haas wants to take Johnny Sain with him to Atlanta as pitching coach . . . With Dallas Green apparently going to the Cubs and taking coach Lee Elia along as his manager , all sorts of rumors float around . One of the most bizarre is that if Houston does not get to the World Series , Bill Virdon ( part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would go to Philadelphia , opening up the Astros ' job for Bob Lemon . . . There is a new Met rumor every day , down from all the ex-Orioles ( Darrell Johnson included ) to Bobby Cox and Bob Kennedy. - For something like $3000 , the Indians are going to let two of their most respected coaches go - Dave Duncan ( pitching ) to Seattle and Joe Nossek ( third base ) to either Kansas City or Seattle . They wanted $35,000 , but the club wouldn ' t go above $32,000 , so they ' ve hit the road , showing the Indians ' priorities . The only reason they stayed the year before is because manager Dave Garcia took his own $25,000 raise and divided it equally among the coaches . . . Everyone seems to feel Nossek has a chance to be an outstanding manager somewhere . . . I doubt it will happen , but it would make sense for the Red Sox to try to sign Mark Belanger as a free agent . He is an outstanding backup who can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he isn ' t traded ) , Steve Lyons ( playing well in the Instructional League , with 18 hits in 8 games in one stretch ) and Joacquin Gutierrez . No , the Orioles won ' t re- sign him . He got a tremendous ovation the last day of the season when they announced it would be his last game in an Oriole uniform , but Earl Weaver , embittered by Belanger ' s derogatory remarks , refused to put him in the game . . . Teams are wary of Belanger because of his labor posture , but the fact is the Red Sox do not have a quality defensive infielder . . . Oh yes . When mediator Kenneth Moffett had his birthday party at Memorial Stadium in the final week , Belanger and Doug DeCinces gave him a present of a T-shirt that read " Trust Me - Ray Grebey. " - Run production leaders by position for the two leagues ( AL players listed first ) : 1b - Cecil Cooper , 118 , Steve Garvey , 117 ; 2b - Bobby Grich , 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 109 , Mike Schmidt , 138 ; SS - Robin Yount , 89 , David Concepcion , 119 ; OF - Evans , 133 , Rickey Henderson , 118 , Dave Winfield , 107 and George Foster 132 , Gary Matthews 123 , Andre Dawson , 111 ; C - Ted Simmons , 92 , Gary Carter , 98 . . . " We finally had to give a guaranteed contract , " said a Reds official after signing Concepcion to that huge contract . A few American League scouts believe Concepcion would have trouble adjusting to real grass , because he ' s been on the turf so long and he bounces so many throws off the phonyturf . . . To put a chill on the second-half clinching party , James Rodney Richard turned over the table of food in anger over something no one understands , and Mike Ivie walked around mumbling and dumped a can of beer on a San Diego writer . Astro officials are worried about what will happen with Richard . . . That " cuckoo , " as Lemon called him , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 16 , 1940 , when a guy named Frank Gernano came out of the stands at Ebbets Field and attacked umpire George Magerkurth . Magerkurth didn ' t press charges , but Reilly will against Frank Kuraccea Jr . of Ansonia , Conn . Informed he was from Connecticut , Graig Nettles cracked , " Probably a Red Sox fan . " The Red Sox may be home , but the old fire lives on . . . Gorman Thomas on Ron Davis ' fastball : " It reacts like a sidearm spitter . A 95-mile-an-hour knuckler . " . . . The Orioles got another of the flock signed cheap when Dennis Martinez , who could have gone out on the market and started talking at $800,000 a year , signed for $2.6 million for five years . That creates an interesting situation for Mike Flanagan , who can be free next year . The O ' s and Jerry Kapstein are supposed to be exchanging offers on him this week , but where Flanagan has had some physical problems the last two years , the club may put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rene Lachemann if he were interested in Andre Robertson ( Yankees ) and Tim Foli Pirates for lefthander Floyd Bannister - fueling the Dave Parker-to-the-Yanks talk since they ' d have to be getting Robertson in that deal . But more than one Pirates official feels the Pirates probably can ' t afford to trade Parker , and , anyway , because the Yankees need power and lefthanded pitching , they don ' t have enough to give , anyway . . . Pittsburgh is still trying to get Bill Madlock signed , then Dale Berra would play short , Johnny Ray second and Foli would be either a utilityman or traded . If Madlock goes , Berra moves to third . . . I just wish the Pirate people would stop reminding us that they wanted to trade Jerry Reuss for Andy Hassler after the ' 78 season . . . The Cubs are talking to Harry Caray . Can you imagine him second- guessing Dallas Green as a GM ? Jim Piersall is doing commentaries on one TV station ' s news . Some journalism there . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-agent class of ' 82 ) or trade him , the fact he got 70 walks , 30 in the last 28 games , tells you what other teams thought of the guys Detroit had hitting behind him . One of them , Richie Hebner , had an off-year , and word is that Sparky Anderson has told the front office to trade him. - Jerry Remy lists two winter projects to work on with Walter Hriniak : bunting towards shortstop and bunting down the third-base line . . . Bobby Bonds hit .166 for the Cubs after his first 10 games . Sayonara . . . Jerry Mumphrey getting $5 million for six years from the Yankees does seem ridiculously high , but Bob Watson maintains that Mumphrey is going to be an outstanding player . " He ' s still putting things together , " says Watson . " He ' s a better baserunner and outfielder than he ' s shown , and he ' s on the brink of becoming a very dangerous offensive player " . . . The power of arbitration : The White Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six-year contract after two seasons . . . The thrill of the Herb Plews Memorial Season was demonstrated by the fact that only eight of the 26 teams drew better in the second half than the first half , led by Detroit , up 6917 a game . Boston was third , up 1855 . Included in the gainers were the Mets , Cubs , Twins and Blue Jays . While those increases were minimal , the White Sox dropped 10,615 and Indians 14,128 a game . The average AL drop was 3114 , the NL ' s 1918 per date . But these extra playoffs will be in , one way or another , soon , because they all want the short-term TV kill .
