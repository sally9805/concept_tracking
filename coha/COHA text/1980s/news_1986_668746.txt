By John Blades , Literary critic . Literary notes . The audience at Louise Erdrich ' s reading next week may be in for a surprise or two if they expect to hear a chapter from her forthcoming novel , " Beat Queen , " which is the title listed in a news bulletin from the Writers ' Committee of the University of Illinois at Chicago . Her book is not about the Beat Generation , Erdrich noted with amusement . The correct title of the book is " The Beet Queen , " and it ' s the second volume in a planned tetralogy that covers several generations of an Indian family in North Dakota . In any case , Erdrich won ' t be reading from " The Beet Queen " either . As it turns out , she plans to read from " Tracks , " which will be the third book in the series she began with " Love Medicine , " the 1984 novel that won Erdrich so many major literary awards . " After you finally finish something you ' ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new , " she said . The excerpt she will read is the first chapter of " Tracks , " which is not exactly something new itself . " I began it a long time ago , before ' Love Medicine , " ' she said . " But it was really unpublishable , one of those long , endless , unstructured first novels . " After finishing " The Beet Queen , " Erdrich returned to the manuscript of " Tracks . " " Parts of it I really wanted to save , and I ended up putting the plot of the whole novel into 20 pages . " In solving one problem , however , Erdrich created another . " I have to write the rest of the novel , but I ' ve already used up all my material . " With " The Beet Queen " ready for September publication , Erdrich said she ' s not apprehensive about her second novel matching the phenomenal success of " Love Medicine , " winner of National Book Critics Circle and Los Angeles Times awards , among many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind off such things . It ' s out of my hands at this point , so I might as well not worry . " For those who want a preview of " The Beet Queen , " a section will be published in the August issue of Chicago magazine , which is also where the first chapter of " Love Medicine " appeared , as the initial winner in the Nelson Algren short story contest . Reached at her home in Northfield , Minn . , Erdrich said she and her husband , Michael Dorris , had been celebrating the sale of another book  --  his first novel , " Yellow Raft in Blue Water , " which Henry Holt will publish next spring . Both of Indian parentage , Dorris and Erdrich collaborate on each other ' s books , calling themselves Ma-and-Pa novelists . " We have such a close working relationship , " she said , " that it ' s hard sometimes to distinguish between ourselves . " Only one of them does the actual writing , Erdrich explained , " but in terms of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . we do that together . " It is Erdrich alone , however , who will take the stage at 7 p. m. on May 22 in the Illinois Room of Chicago Circle Center , 750 S. Halsted St. Admission to the reading , which will be followed by a reception , is $3 .
