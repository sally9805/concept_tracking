The Western states are to Americans what America so often is to the rest of the world , a myth-encrusted land of possibilities . Considered by the imagination , the plains of Texas and the deserts of Utah invite dreams of a footloose future . They promise a fugitive 's paradise : not Arcadia , but a clean slate . The dreams are fed by novels and movies and by the bromides of Sunbelt boosterism . They are also prompted by more than a century of Western landscape photography , from the 19th century panoramas of William Henry Jackson and Carleton Watkins to the raptures of Ansel Adams . Such sources fed the fantasy of the West as a sublime hermitage , an unpeopled vista where the black comedies of human affairs have yet to intrude . <P> This is the imaginary tract that Richard Avedon has now populated . Over a five-year period , at the behest of the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth , Avedon took hundreds of portraits throughout the West . Using an eight-by-ten view camera on a tripod , he photographed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " rattlesnake roundup " in Texas . He picked more than 100 of those shots for a traveling exhibition titled " In the American West , " which began at the Amon Carter earlier this year and has now opened at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington . A condensed version of 44 pictures is also on view at the Pace and Pace/MacGill galleries in New York City . ( Over the next two years , the show will proceed to San Francisco , Chicago , Phoenix , Boston and Atlanta . ) <P> Many of the people in these pictures do hard physical labor , working in mines , on ranches and in slaughterhouses . Some have tumbled into the abyss : prisoners , mental patients or that hapless segment that Avedon labels simply as " drifter . " All of them , from secretaries to millworkers , live in a very different West from the pristine territories of the landscape photographers . Theirs is a place of trials and disappointments , and their faces specify every cent of the cost . <P> Avedon 's emotional scale is weighted decisively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranchers and honey-faced teens , but almost no one ventures a smile . Far more typical is a picture of a vulpine carnival worker with a chilling gaze . A Texas factory worker , wearing a birthday corsage of dollars , even looks as if she knows that she will end up on a museum wall as an emblem for the empty promises of the working life . In case we miss the point , Avedon throws in three bloody head shots of slaughtered % steers and sheep  --  a few notes of medieval fatalism , played country-and-western style . <P> This layer of society is relatively new to Avedon 's camera , which is more commonly trained upon Nastassja Kinski 's pout and Brooke Shields ' rump . He has spent more than three decades at the pinnacle of fashion photography . But at the same time , he has perfected a mordant style of portraiture that mocks the earthly vanity his fashion shots glorify . The fixtures of that style are familiar : unsmiling figures shot in sharp focus against a plain white background . ( Avedon started his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results can be pitiless . With every wrinkle and sag set out in high relief , even the mightiest plutocrat seems just one more dwindling mortal .
