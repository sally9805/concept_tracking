Carter works with Reagan to maintain U.S. foreign policy <P> When , in disgrace with fortune <P> and men 's eyes , I all alone beweep my outcast <P> state , And trouble deaf heaven with my <P> bootless cries ... <P> <P> Like the subject of Shakespeare 's sonnet , Jimmy Carter sits , sometimes for three or four hours at a stretch , in his small private study off the Oval Office , listening to classical music and mulling over Government reports-and his future . He is making few domestic policy decisions in these waning days of his Administration , although last week he did announce plans to veto a $9.1 billion appropriations bill because the measure included a controversial provision , with troubling civil rights implications , that would bar the Justice Department from seeking court-ordered busing to desegregate schools . When enough House members sided with Carter to sustain his threatened veto , House Speaker Tip O'Neill and other congressional leaders postponed adjournment until this week so that a compromise could be worked out . <P> But Carter 's most pressing problems , ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were matters of foreign policy . Both Carter and Reagan are deeply concerned about the hazards of " lameduck diplomacy " - that nations abroad might try to exploit the long transition between Administrations on the assumption that Washington would be too distracted and irresolute to respond . <P> Carter and his aides have carefully kept Reagan and his advisers informed of developments in foreign policy and , at critical junctures , tried to win their support . Jack Watson , Carter 's Chief of Staff , consults regularly with Edwin Meese , Reagan 's top counselor ; Zbigniew Brzezinski , Carter 's National Security Adviser , talks frequently with Richard Allen , Reagan 's chief adviser on foreign affairs and the man likely to become his National Security Adviser . As a result , insists Watson , " there is no paralysis . There is no breakdown in our capacity to react . " <P> Thus Carter and Reagan last week issued separate but equally stern warnings to the Soviets on Poland . Said Carter : " The attitude and future policies of the United States toward the Soviet Union would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force in Poland . " Allen declared that the consequences of a Soviet invasion of Poland " could border on wrecking relations with the U.S. for a long time . Business as usual after such a profound event could not easily be restored . " <P> Similarly , the President and President-elect have stood together on the hostage crisis in Tehran . In Algiers last week , Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher , accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Ulric Haynes Jr. , warned Tehran through Algerian intermediaries that Iran could not expect to get a better deal from the <P> Reagan Administration . He reminded the Iranians that Reagan has pledged to sup port any agreement on the 52 hostages reached by the Carter Administration .
