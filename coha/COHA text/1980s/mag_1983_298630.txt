Concerning the courts , Jane Byrne and Jim Thompson <P> Chicago bills itself as " the city that works , " and anyone familiar with the way it works soon realizes that the secret to smooth functioning is regular nourishment-preferably of the green , folding variety . Examples of this approach-questionable and just plain illegal-regularly come to public attention . But last week even some jaded Chicagoans were shaking their heads over the current run of jinks , high as well as low , being aired . <P> Potentially the most far-reaching scandal involved the Cook County circuit court , the nation 's largest such unified system . The court for the past three years has been the target of an undercover federal investigation conducted by about 200 members of the Justice Department and the FBI .

It revealed that the then mayor paid her husband Jay McMullen , an ex-newspaperman , the extravagant sum of $166,000 for his work in the past year as a consultant to her campaign , while she paid out another $14,175 to her 25-year-old daughter Kathy for secretarial work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her campaign was not hurting for funds : Byrne had raised a record $10.6 million . But her campaign committee is currently $270,000 in debt , and Byrne still managed to find a loose $4,066 in its treasury to finance , with trade-in , a brand-new black Mustang . Byrne defended the purchase because it was a " political car . " Does that mean that Chicagoans will get to see Jane run yet again ? Said Byrne : " I lost , but I did n't die . "
