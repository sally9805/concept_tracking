started with dermatitis and Horner 's syndrome ? a condition that makes Omar 's left eye droop . After steroid treatment , salves , and daily brushing Omar is still scratching his rump like crazy . But Tucker 's real concern this visit was that after their usual two-mile run together , Omar was limping and stiff . ( Tucker felt fine , ) The veterinarian on duty , Dr. JoAnne Carey , told Tucker it seemed to be an arthritis flare-up and said Omar 's athletic days may be numbered . As Carey ruffled the fur on Omar 's beleaguered rump , nesting fleas demonstrated their acrobatic skills . Mrs. Tucker looked stricken , obviously concerned that Omar 's infestation reflected on her sanitation skills . " There were no fleas when this whole thing started . I brush him every day . " Carey concluded the visit by checking Omar 's prostate ( included in the $18 office fee ) and relieving his anal glands ( $15 ) , giving him a steroid shot and pills ( $7.50 ) , flea mist ( $6.50 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to check on the arthritis. by Emily Yoffe The canine class struggle . T HE CLIENTS of Friendship Hospital for Animals in Washington , D.C. , bring an almost religious dedication to the task of monitoring the moods , tics , and excreta of the hospital 's patients . In the veterinary world , patients , especially at an urban small-animal practice like Friendship , have four legs and arc covered with fur . Clients have two legs and pay the bills . Unless rabid , patients are far easier to deal with than clients . The hospital , a simple white building with a pervasive smell of disinfectant , gets its clients from the well-to-do upper northwest section of Washington . A local anchorwoman 's cat , Sydney , is a patient . A neoliberal senator recently HARPER'S/FEBRUARY 1983 brought his vomiting dog for treatment . Embassy Row chauffeurs ferry the fecal samples of ambassadors ' dogs and cats there . The veterinarians at Friendship confirm that , yes , older women dote on their cats and move to the same rhythms . " We do have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats . When I ask them about the problem , they know all the laxatives , " says Dr. Monique Maniet . " One client came in very agitated that her cat was going only twice a day . I wanted to tell her , I wish I could say the same thing for myself . " Dick Tucker , director of the Center for Applied Linguistics ( a nonprofit research institute ) , has been bringing his Labrador retriever , Omar , in about once a week for the past few months . Omar 's troubles D R. PETER GLASSMAN bought the Friendship practice in 1981 from the veterinarian who built the hospital about thirty years ago . The hospital has six veterinarians and an ophthalmologist , six receptionists , four kennel handlers , two veterinary technicians , two groomers , one lab technician , and one bookkeeper . It handles sixty patients a day and has a monthly overhead of 560,000 . Glassman. who is thirty-three , tall and slim with a manner bordering on acerbity , says it would be prohibitively expensive to try to construct a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one could afford it , " he explains . " We have $20,000 worth of orthopedic equipment alone . " Glassman has an interest in public relations and management , vital skills for a successful practice according to Veterinary Economics magazine and the Veterinary Hos-2 13 pital Managers Association newsletter . Glassman has already modernized things . The hospital is now open five nights a week for the convenience of working clients . A computer handles billing and other paperwork and spits out welcoming letters to all new clients and vaccination reminders to old ' ones . Condolence letters are written by hand , and if the dog of a very good client dies , the hospital makes a $10 donation in its name to the James A. Baker Institute for the Study of Dogs at Cornell . The issue of departed animals is a difficult one for veterinarians . It is axiomatic in the profession that a dead pet makes for a deadbeat . ' The hardest bills to collect occur when a dog is hit by a car and dies . The dog is obviously very sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anesthesia , et cetera ? is the most expensive . But then people do n't have a dog , so they do n't want to pay the bill , " he says . Glassman recently sent a bill for $80 to a client whose cat died after surgery for a large tumor , about half of the cost of hospitalization . " If I send her a bill for 380 at least I have a prayer of getting paid . I would n't if 1 sent her a bill for $1511. - The inescapable fact of veterinary practice , that behind every patient is a client , has caused Glassman no small degree of disenchantment with his career . " Kids have this James Herriot impression of the veterinary field . You are respected and a professional , you get to be called Doctor , but you do n't have quite the pressure a physician does , " Glassman says . " Well , it 's not the same thing as being a physician at all . You spend four years in college , four years in professional school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up making what your bookkeeper makes , if you can afford one . " . T HE WORD is obviously not getting back to the hordes of would-be Herriots . Only about 29 percent of qualified applicants are accepted at veterinary school . Rejected applicants have applied so much pressure on the schools that four veterinary colleges have opened in the past five years , bringing the national total to twenty-six . According to an Arthur D. Little study commissioned by the American Veterinary Medical Association , there should be a glut of veterinarians by 1985 . The primary reason why a veterinarian 's life is not like a physician 's has little to do with the species of the patient , and everything to do with the fact that pet owners must pull out the checkbook and pay for medical services rendered , Years of conditioning in the human health-care system ? where an insurance company pays the bills have made this an unpalatable prospect for many . Glassman says he is frankly tired of explaining every procedure as if he were an auto mechanic , or hearing complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their dog 's teeth ultrasonically cleaned than their own . " I tell them , you do n't have to be anesthetized to have your teeth cleaned , " he says . " This is not McDonald's-type medicine . It 's highly individual and extremely labor-intensive . " Article after article in Veterinary Economics demonstrates that most veterinarians are as touchy about this point as Glassman . " Physicians need not worry about investing in and maintaining a full-service hospital . We do . Yet we charge one-fourth to one-tenth the average rate a physician asks for the same or similar procedures , " reads part of " An Open Letter to the Parents of Lassie , Rover and Fluffy . " An editorial on " Professional Burnout and Practice Sellouts : Does One Explain the Other ? " says , " In some other professions , experience and judgment are rewarded by a higher billing rate and greater income . In the veterinary profession , where fees are based on procedures , greater income can be obtained only by working harder . " Veterinarians do . however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such plans have failed since 1945 , new programs in New York and California are being watched closely . " I do n't know a veterinarian who 's not gung-ho , " says Glassman . " Without third-party payments it 's impossible to practice state-of-the-art medicine . The technology is in place , but we ca n't afford to do kidney transplants ur CAT scans . " ( Presumably on cats , ) L 1NDA TYRRELL , manager of the Washington , D.C. , Animal Control Shelter , is a ringer for Jane Fonda , and following Tyrrell while she makes the rounds of the abandoned . animals , you get the idea of a perfect Fonda vehicle . When Tyrrell gets going about people , you can almost hear Fonda doing one of her impassioned set pieces . Fonda would also look great in an " animal control agent " blue police-style uniform . Two years ago the Washington Humane Society won a contract of almost $300,000 to take over the city 's animal control operation from the District of Columbia . The D.C. Dog Pound , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees honed skills of verbal and physical abuse , apparently in order to make the pathetic animals brought there feel at home . It is an irony of animal work that since the Humane Society cleaned things up and established a twenty-four-hour system for picking up the unwanted animals that were formerly left to roam the streets , the number of animals put to death has increased significantly , from 7,979 in fiscal year 1980 ( the last year of the city-run operation ) to 10,653 in FY 1981 . ( For 1982 , the figure is 12,572 . ) And although adoptions have increased more significantly in the same period , from 262 to 585 to 617 , there is a limit to the number of people whu want abandoned animals . So almost every animal that walks in the front door leaves in a trash can after a shot of sodium pentobarbital , which is manufactured under the name of Fatal Plus . The Society attempts to put a better light on the figures by explaining that although they are rounding up HARPER's/FEBRUARY 1983 14 more animals than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " PDs , " or problem-destroyed , as opposed to " HDs , " or healthy-destroyed , animals that could have been adopted . Washingtonians voluntarily gave the Humane Society 6,723 animals last year , mostly dogs and cats , but with a few rabbits , ferrets , and other exotica . The unwanted animals end up at the Society 's main shelter , a squat cinder-block building with indoor-outdoor kennels and cat rooms along an industrial highway in northeast Washington . The Society also has a much smaller shelter , a converted storefront near Walter Reed Hospital where three cruelty investigators are based and where abused animals are brought . Most of the unwanted pets turned in to the main shelter are too old or sick to have any chance of being placed and are walked immediately from the reception area back to the euthanasia room . If an animal is " W. " healthy and relatively young ( requisites for being considered adoptable ) , it will be held for up to a week , space permitting , before getting its injection .

In the nearest garbage can , the head of a black and white cat sticks out from between the legs of a black HARPER'S/FEBRUARY 1983 and white spaniel . It 's impossible to see what else is layered beneath . " We 're just a slaughterhouse for animals , " Tyrrell says . " But until we get the problem under control we have to do it . " Most of the animals that end up in the shelter are brought in by the five animal control officers who travel the city in Dodge Econoline vans , carefully filling out forms as they go , with the particulars of the strays , unwanted pets , and wild animals they pick up . The drivers also ferry the ailing pets of poor and old people without transportation to veterinarians . It is an amazingly haphazard system . People are supposed to leave a deposit of $30 before their pet goes off to the vet , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , the shelter will pick up the tab . More often , a sick pet will be taken to the shelter while the owner decides whether to come up with the money or give custody of the animal to the city . It 's cases such as these that keep the Fatal Plus flowing . As Tyrrell passes the forty runs ? the fenced rectangular areas that hold the dogs ? the animals leap onto their hind legs in a frantic bid for attention . An inordinate number of them are large : shepherds , Dobermans , retrievers . " We ca n't place the big ones anymore , " she says . " With the economy as it is , people ca n't afford to feed them . " Until recently Tyrrell was a cruelty investigator ; but after two years , she asked to be transferred to a desk job because of her reaction to pet owners she investigated . " You really want to kill people , just blow their brains out , " she says . " I became unprofessional . I yelled at people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hieronymus Bosch 's day , he night have taken the photographs that fill the album at the Society 's cruelty shelter . There are cadaverous dogs chained in alleys . Dobermans and shepherds get a lot of this neglect . They are thought of as living burglar alarms ; the hungrier they are , the fiercer they arc . There are many pictures of collars that have eaten through animals ' necks , often to the muscle ; people buy collars for their puppies and do n't change them as the animals grow . Then there are the photos of open lesions crawling with maggots , of buntings and whippings . One woman prosecuted for animal cruelty was acquitted when her lawyer argued that the starved creature with running sores that was removed from her home was not the filled-out , healthy dog that was in the Society 's possession by the time of the trial . j ost MANEECHAI , twenty , is the Humane Society 's night driver . Ile must answer the calls as they conic in , so it 's not unusual for him to crisscross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maneechai rarely used to go into the posh Friendship Hospital territory , but since several people in the Washington area have been bitten by rabid raccoons , rabies hysteria has swept all parts of town and Maneechai now gets called out frequently to affluent neighborhoods to pick up raccoons . Because of the possibility of rabies , the brain of every raccoon picked up is sent to a laboratory for evaluation . During one recent evening there were three raccoon calls : two baby raccoons fallen through a skylight into a bathtub ; a raccoon in a trap ; and a raccoon in a trash can . By the time Maneechai arrived , the raccoon in the trash can was , typically , long gone . The other raccoons , joined two cats already in the back of the van , one a feral cat trapped at the National Zoo , the other a stray from the basement of a downtown building . The next call brought Maneechai back downtown : there was a sick rat at the State Department . Mancechai was loath to take this call , first because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he does n't like to ride with rats in the hack of the van . But he was in luck ; by the time he arrived the State Department rat ( actually , it was on the steps of a park opposite the State Department ) had been dispatched by sinister forces . " Dead A.m. , Butch , who had returned to a deep sleep or coma , went into convulsions . After several unproductive telephone conversations , Mrs. Johnson finally , around 5:00 A.M. , gave a shelter employee permission to put the dog to sleep , a fate shared by the other animals in the van , except for the stray cat , which was held for the legally required seven days . No one claimed it and so it , too , ended up in the freezer room . IN ORDER to decrease the animal population by means other than euthanasia , the Humane Society is attempting to get a contract from the city to run a spay-neuter clinic where the operation will cost about $30 . At Friendship , cat spays start at $75 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , " says Dr. Glassman . " I think people in this neighborhood have enough discretionary income that they can afford the difference , and they recognize that you get what you pay for . " Several local veterinarians , including Glassman , volunteer services to the Society , but most are less than enthusiastic about humane societies , particularly those that provide veterinary services at taxpayer-subsidized rates , " They 're not too happy the Humane Society is getting its act together , " says Glassman . And they 're not the only ones . " Animal societies are notorious for fighting with each other . We are above all that , " says Elizabeth Kiernan , third-generation **27;3684;TOOLONG 1983 K lERNAN does admit to some past problems . " We had to tighten up on discipline . Now we have one absolutely positive rule : no drinking , " she says . As for the pet shop license , she says her lawyers tell her it would jeopardize their nonprofit status . " We will not sit still for being a pet shop . They 'll have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing you well and not trying to trip you up . " Kiernan 's pride in the shelter is obvious as she enthusiastically leads a visitor around . She lovingly points to a bas relief in the lobby of a Maltese with bows in its hair . The legend above it reads : " Bianca devoted her life to my happinessTeena Dimick . " Kiernan explains the sculpture is a thank-you from the League to the late Mrs. Dimick ? n ? e Marion Tully , sister of Alice of concert hall fame ? who was the building fund 's largest benefactor . Out back Kiernan points to a thin brown Doberman , recently brought in , romping with some employees . " She 's so crazy about the men here , I do n't know if that means she wo n't like white people . " Tradition is important to the League . From its founding until the ' 30s , when horses were disappearing from the city streets , the League had an annual Christmas party for the horses , featuring oats , carrots , and apples for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years the Christmas party has moved indoors and become more of a family affair between the board and the employees .

But since we moved here and they the employees l have their own dining room , they just get their food and go back there . It 's not like a big office party , " she says , slightly puzzled . " So this year we decided we 'd give them all a turkey and whatever money that would have gone to the party as part of their bonus . After all , we do n't want the board to cat up all the ribs .
