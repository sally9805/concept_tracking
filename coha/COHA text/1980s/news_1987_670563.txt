The Greenwich Village Jazz Festival , which begins its sixth year this weekend , doesn ' t necessarily increase the amount of fine jazz to be heard in the clubs , but it certainly increases the amount a dedicated listener can reasonably expect ( and afford ) to absorb within a given period . A festival discount pass , selling for $15 , entitles the passholder to a 50 percent discount on admission to first and second sets at the festival ' s 11 participating clubs for the duration of the 11-day festival . Passholders get into third sets , where offered , for free , and also get a 50 percent discount at the Bleecker Street Cinema ' s concurrent jazz film series. // The festival celebrates a neighborhood where live jazz has long been a way of life , and a creative ferment that periodically sparks major changes in the way music is played and heard . The be-bop of the 1940 ' s was the last of the music ' s major stylistic upheavals to marshal its forces and determine its agenda almost entirely within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , from the freedoms trumpeted in the early 60 ' s to the new structuralism and new traditionalism of the last decade , was at least partly incubated in Village clubs , bars , coffee shops and lofts. // The diversity of jazz in today ' s Village makes it seem unlikely that big surprises are on the horizon . But because the music ' s entire historical spectrum has become primary source material for improvisers of widely differing persuasions , the combinations and permutations are , to a certain extent , continually surprising . It isn ' t at all unusual these days to hear a jazz patriarch veer from soft-focus lyricism to abrasive ex-pressionism and back in the course of a tune , or for young musicians to draw on Dixieland textures one moment and rap rhythms the next . The Greenwich Village Jazz Festival offers listeners with stamina an opportunity to feel the pulse of a music in a constant state of recombinative invention. // Special festival events will include a free opening concert from 4 to 7 P.M. today at the Village Gate , with Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpeter Jack Walrath and Masters of Suspense , Junior Mance and Patti Bown , pianists ; and other groups playing simultaneously in three of the club complex ' s rooms . There will be two Saturday-night music cruises , originating at Pier 40 , at West and Houston Streets , beginning tomorrow with the Hank Crawford-Jimmy McGriff band . One-time events at Sweet Basil will include an all-day minifestival of new music , called " Music Is an Open Sky , " on Sept. 7 , from 1 to 8 P.M. , with the 29th Street Saxophone Quartet and bands led by the saxophonist Tim Berne and the trumpeter Hugh Ragin . Tuesday afternoon from 4 to 7 at Sweet Basil , a new jazz label , Reservoir Records , will be recording the Peter Leitch Quartet and the Russian trumpeter Valery Ponomarev and his group , Universal Language , in live performance . <> <> More than 50 Bands // The Village clubs can be charged with conducting business as usual in their bookings for the coming 11 days , but the variety and vitality of the music ordinarily heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone will be able to absorb singlehandedly - more than 50 bands in all . The Blue Note is emphasizing singers , with Carmen McRae tonight through Monday and Tania Maria opening on Tuesday . Bradley ' s usually specializes in pianists , but George Coleman , saxophonist for all seasons , is leading a trio there from Sunday through Sept. 7 , with the attentive and versatile John Hicks at the keyboard and the unfailingly inventive Ray Drummond on bass . Fat Tuesday ' s is favoring the sort of gently impressionistic electric jazz associated with ECM Records , with the quietly lustrous duo of Gary Burton , on vibraphone , and Ralph Towner , playing guitar and piano , tonight through Sunday. // There ' s a double bill at the same club of the guitarist John Abercrombie and his band , and the British trio Azimuth , with Norma Winstone , Kenny Wheeler and John Taylor , Tuesday through Sept. 6 . The British are hardly the festival ' s only international visitors . Adam Makowicz , the formidable Polish pianist who recently signed with RCA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presenting free of charge two recitals by Canadian artists , both of whom are being recorded for live albums . Sonny Greenwich , a dazzling and original guitarist who made a splash on the Village scene in the mid-60 ' s and has been little-heard since , leads a quartet on Wednesday from 4 to 7 P.M. ; a trio led by Oliver Jones , a pianist and a melodist in the Teddy Wilson tradition , plays the following day in the same time slot. // The Village Vanguard is still the Village ' s flagship club . Sweet Basil may have ranged more widely in its bookings and begun giving more young musicians a forum , but the Vanguard has consistently presented uncompromising artists , and inspired thoughtful , committed performances . The Vanguard ' s festival bookings are strong , and perhaps a bit risky . The David Murray quartet , playing through Sunday , and a special Don Cherry band with Carlos Ward and Ed Blackwell , at the Vanguard Tuesday through Sept. 6 , make substantial , challenging music and by no means guarantee a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week was packed ; the Vanguard has probably guessed correctly again , and made presenting good music good business as well . <> <> Exploring Monk ' s World // Sweet Basil is also offering two exceptionally solid contemporary bands . The Mal Waldron-Steve Lacy Quartet will be dissecting Monk ' s legacy and their own angular modal studies tonight through Sunday ; the Timeless All Stars , with Harold Land , an inspirational West Coast tenor saxophonist , are playing Tuesday through Sept. 6. // The smaller clubs participating in the festival offer a more intimate listening experience , a different sort of focus . Visiones , a Latin American restaurant and bar , has become a busy venue for busy young musicians who are working as sidemen with well-known groups while getting their own ensembles started . The restaurant ' s festival bookings include a band led by Vincent Chancey , a fluent French horn player , tomorrow night ; the alto saxophonist Arthur Blythe next Wednesday and Thursday , and Key One , led by Pheeroan Ak Laff , a formidable drummer-around-town , next Friday . Pianists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis sideman , hold court at the 55 Bar , where the atmosphere is casual and some intense music gets played . The Village Corner will have two solo pianists back-to-back every night . And there ' s blues and Dixieland at Arthur ' s Tavern. // Losing its corporate sponsorship two years ago doesn ' t seem to have done the Greenwich Village Jazz Festival much harm . A series of special concerts at Greenwich House began in the festival ' s fourth year , with sponsor support , and was dropped last year when there was no sponsor . But last year ' s festival was a ringing success without sponsorship , and this year the Greenwich House concerts are back , sponsored by the artists themselves . Admission is $10 , or $5 with a festival pass . The series begins tonight at 8 with Second Sight , a young group that has shown signs of working some intriguing personal variations of Blue Note classicism of the mid-60 ' s . Walter Thompson ' s big band is playing on Tuesday and Wednesday ; the series ends Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Noot Orchestra , featuring a mixture of European and American musicians. // The jazz film series at the Bleecker Street Cinema , curated by Bruce Ricker , a jazz film maker and archivist , offers a welcome opportunity to catch up on some of the increasingly impressive new films being made about jazz and its players , as well as some jazz film classics . There will be feature-length portraits of Art Blakey , Ornette Coleman , Sonny Rollins , Steve Lacy , Machito and other interesting figures . The films are a reminder that jazz exists in an eternal present , its past , preserved on recordings and film , as rich and immediate as that present . Appreciating the depth of the music ' s heritage is something a lot of people will be doing . <> <> The Greenwich Village Jazz Festival begins today and runs through Sept. 7 at various clubs in the area .
