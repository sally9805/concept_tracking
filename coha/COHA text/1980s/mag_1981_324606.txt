Californians beat the backlog <P> With a battery of 206 judges , the Los Angeles County Superior Court system is one of the largest in the U.S. Nevertheless , since prosecutors and litigious Californians flood the court with more than 220,000 cases annually , and since criminal matters have priority , it takes more than four years for the average civil jury suit to reach trial . Now some lawyers are beating the queue . The solution : hiring a retired judge to hear the case . <P> What amounts to a rent-a-judge system was launched five years ago by two Los Angeles-area attorneys , Hillel Chodos and Jerome Craig , who were representing opposing sides in a complicated wrangle involving a medical billing firm and its lawyers . They found that an obscure 1872 California law authorizes litigants to have any civil case heard by hired referees , who need not be judges or even lawyers . The pair signed up a retired judge and got the approval of then Presiding Judge Richard Schauer of Los Angeles County Superior Court . Within seven months they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attorneys ' fees . <P> Thus was born a novel system that is being closely watched in California and other states . Once both sides in a dispute agree to set up their own court , they select a judge ( so far all have been retired jurists ) and settle on his pay ( usually $125 an hour , split by the parties ) . If the regular court approves , trial can begin when and where the litigants choose . <P> By averting the 4-year wait for trial , parties almost automatically save money . Normally , Chodos asserts , " lawyers have to justify their existence , so they file 39 depositions and countless motions that are meaningless but costly . " Another advantage of the system , particularly important to litigants in complicated business cases , is that parties can pick judges with expertise in certain fields . Moreover , proceedings can be held in secret and kept off the public record . When Tonight show Host Johnny Carson and NBC were battling over his contract in 1979 , they hired a retired judge to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial began , however , they settled the case . ) <P> Judges regard the system as the best thing since raised benches . Los Angeles jurists , who earn $60,000 a year , retire comfortably : a 20-year man receives a pension of $45,000 . But an energetic ex-judge can increase that income greatly by freelancing . Eugene Sax received more than $40,000 for five months of work on a dispute between California 's air resources board and several oil industry giants . <P> Because private courts can work only when both parties want a prompt decision , their growth potential is limited . Explains Judge Schauer : " Over 99.9% of our cases involve one side that does n't want to go to court . Defendants do n't want that day of judgment . " The typical rent-a-judge case involves squabbling business partners who are eager to get a ruling and resume their profitable venture . Recently , private judges have also started handling family law matters .
