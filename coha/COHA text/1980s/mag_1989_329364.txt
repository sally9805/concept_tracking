At the same time , rich Government subsidies that encourage farmers to devote too much land to a single crop have contributed to topsoil erosion . American agricultural policy should be changed to support " environmentally benign " farming methods , declared a study published last week by the National Academy of Sciences . The report urged the Government to encourage farmers to adopt such techniques as crop rotation and mechanized weeding , which the study found to be as productive as chemical methods .
