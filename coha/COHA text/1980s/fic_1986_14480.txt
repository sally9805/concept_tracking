The actors on their special state ( like a reviewing box ) tell the story . Gigantic flower stems and blades of grass reduce the paraders to the size of ants .

A float enters . Upon it is depicted the pageant of the wall of painNow , it is common knowledge that the &nbsp; &nbsp; edge of night 's surrounded by a wall &nbsp; &nbsp; of pain . But it is uncommon knowledge An ACTRESS on the narration stage speaks over music:That the wall is peach . Peach &nbsp; &nbsp; is the color of the blood of angels . &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is common knowledge That love , that night , this discourse , &nbsp; &nbsp; with such a wall as I 've described , &nbsp; &nbsp; acts like a prison . But it is Uncommon knowledge that the prison 's &nbsp; &nbsp; fleshy peach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in the dark wall of pain . Simultaneously , the moon risesThey are round and holy and they &nbsp; &nbsp; pour forth light , and at the center &nbsp; &nbsp; of each window is its dark gleam . And it is not knowledge at all &nbsp; &nbsp; but an intuition , a secret , and a &nbsp; &nbsp; divining , that one can love With such a power on this night &nbsp; &nbsp; that one can rise and &nbsp; &nbsp; hover high upon the wall , That one can see right through &nbsp; &nbsp; a window in the wall of pain . &nbsp; &nbsp; One can see through it ! The wall in the moonlight appears to be a faceBeloved ! I speak not of walls &nbsp; &nbsp; but of faces like walls , &nbsp; &nbsp; high-boned peach fortresses . ( Peach is the color of the blood &nbsp; &nbsp; of angels . ) A window in a wall of pain &nbsp; &nbsp; is an eye in the face of a beloved And the gleam in the eye &nbsp; &nbsp; is the refraction of a flame &nbsp; &nbsp; of recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour forth &nbsp; &nbsp; a light beam .

QUEEN How does it prepare its mind ? WARRIOR It prepares its mind in the way of &nbsp; &nbsp; lightness ; TERMITE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it thrusts from its mind WARRIOR The weight of consequence .

TERMITE The materials of this art are not expensive , &nbsp; &nbsp; the apprenticeship not long . Masters  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; there have been but few . And they , scattered and little know . &nbsp; &nbsp; Charlatans , fakirs , mere craftsmen  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; these have multiplied . QUEEN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet even so The art of suicide has always ruled &nbsp; &nbsp; the others . It rules over poetry . It &nbsp; &nbsp; conquers music and vanquishes the dance . p. 7 The QUEEN and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name &nbsp; &nbsp; is surrender , that it is like &nbsp; &nbsp; the cherry blossom over the blue wave , So frail that it shivers even before &nbsp; &nbsp; the storm , and seeks to fall &nbsp; &nbsp; even before the elements dislodge it , So as to give to the puff of wind &nbsp; &nbsp; its fragrance , even as it gives &nbsp; &nbsp; to the blue wave its flowery soul . TERMITE All that has been writ is writ &nbsp; &nbsp; here of the beholder , a warrior &nbsp; &nbsp; of the caste of drone . An artist in its right , WARRIOR a smaller life , QUEEN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when one considersthe multitude in the scheme . GRIOT And the ant says WARRIOR I sing of the moment of the love &nbsp; &nbsp; of it that was our last beginning &nbsp; &nbsp; for once-and-for-all time .

Yes , he did . The bandwagon exits@@ The musicians of Part I horseshoe the stage . Center and raised above them , a Bunraku puppet stage . A backdrop of four large painted panels . The center two slide so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four low rectangular panels form the downstage playboard . The CHILD NARRATOR ( voice of the WARRIOR ) speaks over a musical introduction:An Ant alone is an ant afraid . &nbsp; &nbsp; It disappears and reappears &nbsp; &nbsp; like a sun flash on a water wave . As each of us is seen by death , &nbsp; &nbsp; so draw a picture of an ant alone &nbsp; &nbsp; for fear of vanishing holding its breath . The ENSEMBLE plays and sings:An ant aloneis an ant afraidit goes into this worldonly to pray An ant aloneIs an ant afraidHolding its breathSo it wo n't blow away It 's looking for its motherAnd finding her notTo God it turnsOne God or another , saying Take me , Lord , I want to besmaller my God , to thee GRIOT To the naked eye an ant appears &nbsp; &nbsp; unchanged , but unto itself &nbsp; &nbsp; it 's metamorphosized .

An ant prays &nbsp; &nbsp; so fervently , it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulated by three puppeteers . KOTARO and the voice of the CHILD NARRATOR represent the WARRIOR ANT . Poses , changes of the painted backdrops on the sliding screens , significant gestures , important lines and changes of mood are emphasized by percussion in the Japanese traditionThe campaign was over and &nbsp; &nbsp; the ant prepared to go home . &nbsp; &nbsp; Then it stopped short ! The ANT is walking . A pose of the ANT stopping shortNot knowing where home was , &nbsp; &nbsp; The mist on the ground lifted and &nbsp; &nbsp; before the ant stood an incredible tree . IT leans backward to see the tree 's topThe face of the tree was black . &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun behind it poured thick beams &nbsp; &nbsp; over all its trunk and branches . The ANT kneels to prayThe ant rose on its hind legs &nbsp; &nbsp; It lifted its four hands in prayer &nbsp; &nbsp; and testified . The voice of the ANT:King of Kings and Lord of Plants ! &nbsp; &nbsp; I am neither fish nor fowl ; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an insect ! Nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I have fought ten years &nbsp; &nbsp; and nothing is won or lost . Yet , I can not say , &nbsp; &nbsp; " I fought for nothing ! " &nbsp; &nbsp; I fought for You . The ANT trembles with fear and covers its eyesWhen night fell upon my life &nbsp; &nbsp; I trusted it . I knew it &nbsp; &nbsp; to be your shadow . I have lived Long among the dark temptations . &nbsp; &nbsp; I have lived with the Devil . &nbsp; &nbsp; ( The Devil is the shadow of the Lord . ) IT uncovers its eyes and gazes in raptureAnd I sought false comforts . But &nbsp; &nbsp; I can see , on the other side of you &nbsp; &nbsp; light shines . I can see this ! The narrator is the QUEEN:And with this , the ant cut off &nbsp; &nbsp; its antennae and took its vows . &nbsp; &nbsp; It vowed to go on pilgrimage The ANT takes off its sword and its headbandTo the top of the Sequoia tree ; &nbsp; &nbsp; higher than it had ever flown . &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poses at the foot of the Sequoia tree Two screens slide into place with a painting of an ant 's view of a Sequoia tree . The climbing music begins . The ANT climbs the Sequoia tree . Twice , new paintings are introduced showing the height of its progress . The GRIOT chants:Bell , no bowl , no book . For thirst &nbsp; &nbsp; there were dewdrops ; for the hunger &nbsp; &nbsp; of the Termite there was the body of the God . At the topmost reaches of &nbsp; &nbsp; the Sequoia tree , the world is &nbsp; &nbsp; profound beyond intelligence . The WARRIOR has reached the top of the Sequoia tree and gazes in awe . The CHOIR sings:Here ! O Ant , here at this height ! &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is the truth in the form &nbsp; &nbsp; of moisture ! Here is a resound Of thunder , and an enlightenment &nbsp; &nbsp; of rain , and here in each &nbsp; &nbsp; cloud is its proper cruelty . In the blue light ! In the blast &nbsp; &nbsp; of blue sky-lidded light , ( which &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging by a &nbsp; &nbsp; silken thread . Here , O Ant , life &nbsp; &nbsp; hangs by threads ! Abide , O Ant , And leave this world ! Live out &nbsp; &nbsp; your life in this cocoon and here &nbsp; &nbsp; await the white moth of the moon . The puppet PRINCESS KUZUNOHA enters . SHE and the voice of the female narrator represent the DEATH MOTH:Abide it does and lives with Death &nbsp; &nbsp; in her pavilion in the sky until the &nbsp; &nbsp; time writ in the book for it to die . SHE appears wrapped in a cocoon of white silk hanging by a thread from a branch . SHE is unwound to the music of a danza . The narrator is the QUEEN:And so a death moth becomes the &nbsp; &nbsp; ant 's last lover . Death and the Warrior ! &nbsp; &nbsp; Love is perfection , perfection of loves Loved before , for of all the graces &nbsp; &nbsp; and delights of passions past , &nbsp; &nbsp; at core , what had not been Death in them had been superfluous . &nbsp; &nbsp; In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the goods of this world . Death 's needs were not in the &nbsp; &nbsp; realm of the goods . She hungered not &nbsp; &nbsp; for fame , fortune , or victory . She was no searcher after self . &nbsp; &nbsp; How strange ! She was the antithesis &nbsp; &nbsp; of all things ant-like . Yea  --  As things create their opposites , &nbsp; &nbsp; the insect 's death was born of the excess &nbsp; &nbsp; of life in it . As lover can discover In itself , the self that is beloved , &nbsp; &nbsp; as one embracing arm can feel its strength &nbsp; &nbsp; according to the other 's pressure  --  So , to the ant , it was revealed &nbsp; &nbsp; that Warriors exist &nbsp; &nbsp; because Death loves them . The narrator is the TERMITE:What percentage of a falsehood Is as good as true ? What part of fact is &nbsp; &nbsp; just one 's faith in it ? The power of an &nbsp; &nbsp; ant 's obsession rules summer 's last days . The MOTH sits on a branch , stretching luxuriouslyThe insect erects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no upper limit to a &nbsp; &nbsp; tower of euphoria . ) Life and Death , Here , in the form of ant and moth , &nbsp; &nbsp; work against time . They will conceive &nbsp; &nbsp; new generations , they will mount New campaigns , command new armies ; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( Not of ants alone ! Of half the &nbsp; &nbsp; insect world ! And of some vertebrates ! ) The ant will heal its wounds . Miraculously , &nbsp; &nbsp; new antennae from its brow will sprout , &nbsp; &nbsp; and wings , again , will lift it high as aether . The cocoon becomes a shrine called &nbsp; &nbsp; The Pavilion on the Lake of Sky . &nbsp; &nbsp; Artists come and paint its holy history On screens , these , in turn , in triptych , &nbsp; &nbsp; become ant ikons . " Blessed are the Last Days &nbsp; &nbsp; of Summer in the Pavilion on the Lake of Sky . " Here , the words fade under a musical introductionThis is the title of the first screen . &nbsp; &nbsp; It shows Death , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her habitude , On a green leaf , framed in the redwood &nbsp; &nbsp; branches , she drinks a delicious cup of coffee . The MUSICIANS play and sing:Blessed are the last days of summerIn the pavilion The MOTH on her branch has her morning cup of coffeeOn the lake of SkyBasking in the sunShe drinks a cup of coffee SHE dances for the ANT in mid-airHer wings are black silkThe moth is night 's snowflakeShe opens her eyesShe whispers come fly with me The ANT applauds . SHE flutters to another branch where SHE rests and fans herselfBlessed are the last days of summerIn the pavilion The MOTH swims in the blue airThey go swimming highIn the deep blue sky First breaststrokeJust like the birds , they 're flying Then backstrokeThe time love can buyIs time out from dying THEY drink a champagne toast , clinking glassesLet 's drink to the sunFor winter lies waiting MOTH and ANT exit together , swimmingBlessed are the last days of summerIn the pavilion Spoken over music . The narrator is the QUEEN:With love , it does not matter  --  day or &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; chosen hours , when , like orbed miracles , Sun and moon shine together , ant and moth &nbsp; &nbsp; step out upon the meniscus curve &nbsp; &nbsp; of blue , depressing the sky 's skin Like bugs , the skin of water . They fly &nbsp; &nbsp; into the blooms of galaxies and suck the &nbsp; &nbsp; nectar therefrom . Yes , that is their food  --  The firestorms , the drops that burn &nbsp; &nbsp; like comets on the tongue . Love of moth &nbsp; &nbsp; is love of ant 's apotheosis . Death is its darling ; this Death is &nbsp; &nbsp; its own . Her wings , like two fellatio tongues , &nbsp; &nbsp; suck out its battlesongs and swallow . Sweet soft core of inspiration ! Now &nbsp; &nbsp; it knows ! Death gets it off ! Of course , &nbsp; &nbsp; the ant is mad ( and a trifle sexist , too ) . A Warrior , it confuses loving Death &nbsp; &nbsp; with conquering the thing . &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes , it confuses them Night . Moon . The MUSICIANS play and sing:Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been writtenAnd on the death of love , Even moreBut what of the pain DeathHerself enduresFor a living thingEach time she takes one The MOTH enters , weepingShe cries until the cloudsAre burnt through by starlightLeaving him she flies offLike a ghostOnly to reappear with ahost of golden trumpeteersNow the ant can tellDeath is an angel The ANT enters , asleep , curled on a branchThe warrior dreamsShe comes back to find himThe moth says to the ant " I am truth ! And truth I fearYou do n't want to hear " The ant says , " Yes I do.Death moth I want you . " The MOTH , weeping profusely , lets down her hairEach time she takes oneEach time she takes a lifeInto her heartThe rush of blood andThe flood of mind destroy herEach time she takes oneDeath dies a little too The voice of the DEATH MOTH over the music continued instrumentally:Each time she takes a life into Her heart , her heart breaks over it . &nbsp; &nbsp; And broken-hearted she is brought , by stages , &nbsp; &nbsp; to unbearable loneliness and decline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dumb showThe moth becomes a recluse . &nbsp; &nbsp; She falters and fades , languishing &nbsp; &nbsp; like a flower deprived of sun and water . Only rarely does she speak , &nbsp; &nbsp; and then , with such a childlike and &nbsp; &nbsp; tremulous sound , the ant hears it As the music of a harp of cobwebs &nbsp; &nbsp; dripped upon by dews . By day &nbsp; &nbsp; she cowers wide-eyed with confusion , Her mind a litany of anguish &nbsp; &nbsp; and a sensibility deranged . &nbsp; &nbsp; " What should she wear ? " " How should she do her hair ? " &nbsp; &nbsp; The ant is seized with dread , &nbsp; &nbsp; he can not find her thread . SHE begins to choke and trembleBy night her eyes are wider still &nbsp; &nbsp; for as confusion starts to clear , &nbsp; &nbsp; the moth begins to suffocate with fear . The pit is deep ; its walls are slippery . &nbsp; &nbsp; She lives with terror in a trance . &nbsp; &nbsp; Her need for love is endless , ( Fear burns love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Death Moth &nbsp; &nbsp; are ever near extinguishing . ) What could Death be afraid of ? A pose of the MOTH , grieving GRIOT Alas , no thing can see with greaterclarity than she , that love will lose p. 11 The MOTH touches the ANT , who awakensHer wisdom comes upon her &nbsp; &nbsp; in an effect so curious ; the &nbsp; &nbsp; moth dissolves in waves of light . SHE takes IT in her armsDeath 's dear face is insubstantial ; &nbsp; &nbsp; her body waxes and wanes , it becomes &nbsp; &nbsp; translucent , and the ant sees through her . THEY look into each other 's eyesThe ant sees right through Death . &nbsp; &nbsp; So rare a sight is this , so few &nbsp; &nbsp; of all the living things have Seen this that an insect sees . &nbsp; &nbsp; The ant can see the angel which &nbsp; &nbsp; an eye must look through Death to see . It sees Death is of God 's dominion , &nbsp; &nbsp; too , not an unholy thing ; &nbsp; &nbsp; God 's creature , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall die &nbsp; &nbsp; of pity . The story goes , &nbsp; &nbsp; " An Ant shall die of pity and love The DEATH MOTH carries the WARRIOR awayFor Her whom all the Saviors missed . " &nbsp; &nbsp; O Compassionate Ant ! How fitting ! &nbsp; &nbsp; Death shall kill thee with her pain . All the MUSICIANS and SINGERS sing and play:O Warrior AntAll wars are lostYour luck 's run out andGhostly storms are raging O Warrior AntWho does she loveWhile you 're dreamingWhich one is she taking FoolYou loved her so dearlyYou have won herAwake and flee O Warrior AntAll wars are lostDreamy victoriesCannot redeem you The music continuesO Warrior AntAll wars are lost GRIOT There comes a night when even angels &nbsp; &nbsp; can not sleep . They cry till all the &nbsp; &nbsp; clouds are burnt with falling stars . On this night , Death , weeping , leaves &nbsp; &nbsp; the sleeping ant , and flies off like a ghost , &nbsp; &nbsp; into the moon , to reappear with minions . O Ant ! By day they 're black as ash . &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; see them in the sky without God 's light . The moth says to the ant , &nbsp; &nbsp; " I am the truth ! And truth , &nbsp; &nbsp; I fear , you do n't want to hear . " The ant says in its dream , &nbsp; &nbsp; " I do . Death Moth , I want you . " &nbsp; &nbsp; And wedded to him by his words , It 's Death alights right on the leaf &nbsp; &nbsp; from which the tiny white cocoon &nbsp; &nbsp; hangs swaying . Inside , as in a holy cell , The ant is sleeping . And the Gods &nbsp; &nbsp; in their Realms , and the beings on &nbsp; &nbsp; their planets ALL STOP EVERYTHING ! The wheel of Karma pauses till the truth &nbsp; &nbsp; be known . Can an ant attain enlightenment ? &nbsp; &nbsp; Will the Warrior be the first among its kind ? p. 12 EVERYONE on stage shakes his/her head sadly:No . GRIOT O Ant , you 'll wake no longer to this world . &nbsp; &nbsp; May you awake upon the fingernail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumb of Heaven home . The MOTH has awakened the WARRIOR to DEATHDeath claims the Warrior Ant &nbsp; &nbsp; for he is now her own . Like two &nbsp; &nbsp; dreams dreaming of each other , High against the night clouds we see DEATH flying , the ANT riding upon her back as in a tranceAnt flows into moth , moth into ant , &nbsp; &nbsp; across the line of void , until each &nbsp; &nbsp; annihilates the other with annihilating love . The Death Moth and the Warrior Ant , &nbsp; &nbsp; like the touching of a plus and &nbsp; &nbsp; minus charge , vanish in mid-air . For a moment the ANT appears to hear the SINGERS callingAnd nature returns to herself , &nbsp; &nbsp; and in its own mysterious way , &nbsp; &nbsp; is tranquil . In the brittle bowl Then its head falls back and DEATH carries the WARRIOR into another world
