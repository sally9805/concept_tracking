( THE LIGHTS FADE UP on BECKS , a college professor . She stands in front of a chalkboard with the following images drawn on it:She lectures to an unseen , but evidently attentive classroom . BECKS , 30-something , dressed in a dark suit and her hair in a bun , strains to project a no-nonsense , business-like persona . ) BECKS Obviously , these are diagrams of orgasms patterns of orgasms ( She points to each picture as she refers to it . ) To the left , we have the male orgasm , which builds to a single climax tapering off afterwards . To the right , we have the female orgasm , which builds from one climax onto another , and another multiple orgasms or multiplicity . ( She looks out into the classroom and listens to the question . ) Yes . That 's right . Sexual orgasms . Male and female . You want me to label them ? You ca n't tell the difference ? ( She listens . ) Okay . ( She writes " male " and " female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting at is , in terms of structure within the literary canon ( She writes " canon " on the board ) , " C-A-N-O-N " ( A loud snoring sound is heard . BECKS pauses and looks around . ) Could someone please tap Jim on the shoulder ? ( The snoring stops . BECKS stares at him ) Good morning , Jim . You need to wake up or turn over on your side . Thanks . Anyway , what the academicians deemed to be literary masterpieces and put in the canon  --  these books follow the male structure of orgasm , building to one climax ( She traces the drawing as she speaks . ) Exposition , rising action , climax , quick denouement ( Laughter is heard . ) Hold it down a minute , please Let me finish Books by women , which often follow the female multi-climactic structure , or multiplicity , were not allowed into the canon . Even today , they are not widely understood , let alone liked . Just think of the word canon , for starters . What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The wheels on a cannon look like what ? ( She checks herself hastily ) Right , and is it surprising that works penned by women are not understood by " canon-makers " ? ( BECKS draws a picture of a cannon on the board , next to the diagram of the male orgasm . ) Women were not accepted into the university system until the twentieth century . Even fifty years ago women were a rarity in academe . So naturally , works by women were read and analyzed only by men , who missed the big point so to speak . For example , great works , like Sarah Orne Jewett 's The Country of the Pointed Firs or even Charlotte Perkins Gilman 's The Yellow Wallpaper , clearly follow the multiclimactic structure . They do n't progress in a linear way , but scenes follow each other linked by seeds of subjects introduced before , like a resonance , or reverberation , thus building a story with many interweaving crises . These books were only recently added to college curricula , in courses like this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Yes ? ( She turns around . ) Well , I suppose it does sort of look like a breast , yes , yes This is not supposed to be titillating  --  This is a serious look at the way women communicate and why these works have been misunderstood  --  I wo n't be giving any pop quizzes , very funny ( She mops her brow and looks at another student . ) What ? Wait , I want to answer that . No , I do n't hate men . Why would you ask ? p. 3 BLACKOUT p. 4 Act 1 , Scene 2 GIRL WONDERScene Two ( BECKS ' living room . Later the same day . It 's sparsely furnished with a couch and a table . BECKS wears the same suit as in Scene One . She pours over papers that are spread out over her furniture . She wears glasses as she reads . Her house has the feeling of being in a constant state of disarray . There 's a knock on the door . BECKS rises to open it . MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MOTHER Surprise ! Surprise ! BECKS ( Warmly ) Mother . ( She hugs her . ) It 's you . What are you doing here ? I did n't know you were in town . MOTHER Yes , darling . Surprise ! ( Taking note of the messy surroundings ) Happy Birthday ! ( MOTHER , humming the " Happy Birthday " song , crosses to BECKS and surveys her . ) BECKS Thanks , thanks . I forgot it was my birthday . And I 'm on my way to school  --  MOTHER Well . Here we are to celebrate your birthday the right way ! Your father and I have flown in for the occasion and insist on taking you out on the town . He 's in a meeting right now so I thought I 'd drop by with a birthday hello . BECKS Great . p. 5 MOTHER And as a special birthday present , we 've even gotten you a date . Is n't that wonderful ? BECKS Dates ? They 're tasty . Thanks . MOTHER Not fruit . Please . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember him . Jerome ? BECKS You 've gotten me a date ? With a man ? Mother , I ca n't . MOTHER Why not ? BECKS I just ca n't . I have n't been on a date in ten years . MOTHER Calm down . You look sick . ( She touches BECKS ' check . ) I love you but not even a soldier would take you looking so pale . BECKS Mother , I ca n't possibly even think about going out tonight . I 'm in the middle of a paper for the convention and  --  MOTHER ( Sighing ) I knew we never should have let you skip a grade , Rebecca . BECKS Aaaagh ! Mother ! Call me Becks , okay ? MOTHER I will not call you that horrible androgynous name . You 're not a brand of beer to me . I never should have let that principal , Ms. Whats-her-name , talk us into all this . Even if you were the brightest child she 'd ever seen . If you 'd stayed in school at the same rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being an aging " Girl Wonder "  --  p. 6 BECKS ( Turning ) I 've got to find my syllabus and  --  MOTHER I 'm your mother . I 'm not on your syllabus . ( She pats BECKS on the back . ) Your legs are still good . Even at your age . BECKS What ? Oh . Well , I do n't want students staring at my legs  --  MOTHER That was a compliment , not a criticism . Say thank you . BECKS I just do n't think about my legs ever , Mother . It seems like sort of sexist area of discussion and  --  MOTHER Why ca n't some millionaire stare at your legs and then sweep you off them ? ( She sits down . ) BECKS Let 's drop this ridiculous topic . That will never happen . I do n't know any men . MOTHER You 've got to get out of the Women 's Studies department . It 's very limiting that way . BECKS ( Sarcastically ) Next you 'll probably want to discuss cosmetics . MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's complexion is a roadmap to her soul . Blemishes are signs of , well , shall we say , the rocky roads to come ? Pock marks never got a girl anywhere . Acne is no acme. p. 7 BECKS Oh , now , that 's really profound , Mother . Right up there with " The bigger the better , the tighter the sweater " . MOTHER ( Seriously ) Honey . Your father and I , we 're worried about you . We rejoiced when you got tenure . We loved your last award-winning study of the Brontes . But we want grandchildren , darling . BECKS Do n't you want me to make a contribution to the intellectual world ? MOTHER I want you to be happy . BECKS ( Seriously ) I am happy . MOTHER You 've really convinced me . BECKS I 'm very happy . ( She smiles ) MOTHER Look around here . How can you be happy ? This place is a disaster . As long as you 're collecting piles of papers , it would help to have an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick . I hear that biological clock . Time to make ourselves a bit more accessible . The sight of a familiar magazine will always put a suitor at ease . ( She takes out a portfolio from her purse and starts to make a list . ) The Atlantic ? No , but Self is a must . And The New Yorker for those extra special coffee table displays . p. 8 BECKS I do n't have a coffee table . MOTHER That is duly noted . ( Puts away portfolio . ) You do n't own a good house , you do n't own a coffee table , or a good solid European car . No Godiva chocolates either , I suppose . No Double Dutch chocolate low-calorie Instant Coffee for intimate chats with your mum . ( Sits on couch . ) And you tell me you 're happy . BECKS Why did n't you tell me you were coming ? MOTHER No Donna Karan 's in the closet , I gather Where is your closet ? BECKS ( Exasperated ) In the bedroom . It 's practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , and do n't give me anymore lingerie . I 've got to  --  MOTHER All right . ( She throws up her hands and sits down calmly on the couch . ) It is your birthday and the festivities have just begun . About tonight . That Phillips boy . He 's been in touch with your father through business . You remember Jerome ? BECKS No . And I do n't have time to remember some childhood playmate at the moment . I 've got an important meeting . MOTHER Oh ? A cocktail party at the Dean 's , perhaps ? Any possibility for an academic affair ? ( She giggles . ) Get it ? p. 9 BECKS It 's a brainstorming session . MOTHER A brainstorming session . BECKS With Jo and Berry . MOTHER Joe and Barry . Are they single ? BECKS Professors Josephina Murray and Berry Mary Bartlett . You know . The rest of the Women 's Studies Department .

BECKS As if sexual preference has any link with ability to function in a career capacity  --  MOTHER I 'm trying my best to make this a happy birthday for you , to get your life back on track . What about marriage ? What about children ? BECKS I 'm working on a new theoretical study . MOTHER ( Kindly ) And I 'm sure it 's important . But you 're not young any more , Rebecca . We raised you to be intelligent , yes , strong , yes , but not afraid . There 's a difference . You 're afraid to experience what life is really all about . p. 10 BECKS Life is about men ? I do n't think so . MOTHER Greek , Latin and Cultural Anthropology do not a complete person make . Oh Lord , how can my daughter , who has such a high I.Q. , be so stupid about the love ? Have you forgotten that word ? How could I have let you down like this ? It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , times have changed . Women want economic , political , social , sexual and intellectual parity in emotional partnerships . Not love . MOTHER Is that what girls want today ? Parity in partnerships ? ( She smiles knowingly and shakes her head ) . Then no wonder we 're in trouble . No man wants to deliver all that . You 're still living in an old retrograde feminist fantasyland . ( Hugging BECKS ) You 've got to open yourself up to people . All love starts with looks , attraction based on appearance , that 's what it 's all about . The rest blossoms afterwards . You 're still attractive when you let yourself be . Just try . Forget about this equality business for tonight . Wear some makeup when we 're out with the Phillips boy . For me , dear ? BECKS I 'm not going to put on a phony costume for some man . This is who I am . I 'm an independent , intelligent , and fulfilled career woman of the 90 's . Everything 's going well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( MOTHER caresses her . ) Being smart does n't have to mean being alone . I guess I 'll let you go to school . Happy Birthday .

AS THE LIGHTS COME UP , we see BERRY sitting alone at the table . BERRY , in 30 's , wears a pretty , feminine dress . BECKS enters with JO . JO is in her early 40 's , dressed in jeans , boots and a white button down shirt . She is casual , at ease , a power professor . JO sports a purple leather tie . She sits down at the table . LIGHTS SHIFT , focusing on the roundtable . ) BARLETT So what 's this big pow-wow about ? You do n't look too good . ( BECKS sits down hurriedly . ) MURRAY ( Throwing papers on table ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your last . BECKS What ? MURRAY ( Holds one paper in her hand ) Our department is going to be phased out . BECKS By whom ? MURRAY The Humanities Division . I quote : " Unless you can justify the research funds and departmental standards you have been using for the last ten years to the satisfaction of the Dean , we regret to inform you that this department will be phased out , and Women 's Studies classes will be integrated , on a limited basis , into the general Humanities curricula . " End quote . p. 13 BARLETT I ca n't believe it . How can they do this to us ? BECKS Who 's the memo from ? MURRAY Who else ? Rafe Samuelson BARLETT I ca n't believe it . I just ca n't believe it . This is the end . MURRAY No , it 's not . It 's the beginning . BECKS ( Puzzled ) The beginning of what ? MURRAY I always forget that you two missed the 60 's . Look , we 'll stand together . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really great project that will prove our worth . All for one and one for all . Okay ? BARLETT I just ca n't believe it . MURRAY Berry . Snap out of it . BARLETT Okay . Okay . MURRAY Okay . Let 's think of something feasible and fast . Let 's make a list of possibilities and then narrow it down Are you okay , Becks ? You look funny . BECKS I 'm in feminist shock . MURRAY Well , use it . Rally , everyone . Becks , you take notes . Fast and feasible . Fast and feasible We should consider doing something new about Emily Dickinson . p. 14 BECKS ( Taking notes ) Yes , she 's so fundable , she 's refundable . A pecuniary perennial . BARLETT And how about this  --  female gang leaders that write poetry  --  do an anthology . Take to the streets and do some workshops as part of the package . BECKS ( Jotting ) Excellent . We can really make a statement . The National Endowment would love it . MURRAY ( Inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night in bed , sort of a fantasy project  --  a musical version of The New Our Bodies , Ourselves . What do you think ? A co-venture with the theatre department . Songs about STD 's , PID 's , UTI 's , and PMS . We get state money for the adaptations  --  mini-commissions for each disease . We do an AIDS benefit and give a cut to Ms. Maybe Gloria Steinem shows . BECKS ( Puts down pen ) Well , I do n't know about that  --  BARLETT Sounds depressing to me . MURRAY Just write it down . ( BECKS writes it down . ) BARLETT Now I 'm getting angry . BECKS Ah . Feminist wrath . p. 15 BARLETT It comes after the shock . I ca n't believe we have to do this . Why ca n't we move our divisional affiliation , Jo ? MURRAY To where ? BARLETT English ? MURRAY You know they do n't want us anymore , not after that Norman Mailer protest that we did . BARLETT Why are we always being put down ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BECKS We 're getting off the subject . BARLETT It 's all Samuelson . Remember what he said about my matriarchy paper ? Before he refused to let me present it at the convention ? ( In deep voice ) : " I found your evidence woefully inadequate . You have only circumstantial proof that women ruled over men . And you did n't address the locus of sexual repression which would have directly affected the end of any so-called women 's nation . " I 'd like to show him a locust all right . Right on the old ba  --  BECKS We 'll just have to convince him that it 's important for the national reputation of this university that your research be heard  --  BARLETT How 're we going to do that ? If I 'm in the same room with him I 'm going to kill him . You know Jo quit speaking to him in 1985. p. 16 MURRAY The whole point is we do n't need his approval . We do n't need the approval of any man . BARLETT We do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of course , that bothered him . BECKS Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Samuelson . MURRAY Do n't be such a het , Becks . BECKS What ? MURRAY ( Shaking her head ) You 're acting like a hetero . Only heteros think men can talk . The point is we 've got to find ways to get our work out there inspite of Samuelson ! Talking with him will only give him more information , more incentive to shut us down . The whole point of our meeting today is to find a way to save our department before he does away with us completely . BECKS Look , Jo . I think we 've got to acknowledge that this man is the head of our division , whether we like it or not . All of our projects go to him for approval . That 's the way this institution works . So why not try to get him on our side ? BARLETT Rafe Samuelson is the enemy . We do n't want the enemy in our camp . MURRAY Men are slime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sisterhood is all about . ( To BECKS ) What kind of a feminist are you , anyway ? p. 17 BECKS I 'm the kind that would like to see our offices moved out of the basement to a new building , not because our department has been shut down . And I 'm confident that I can convince one of my academic colleagues , male or not , of the intellectual value of our work . MURRAY I did n't request the basement location , thank you very much . BECKS I 'll use the pretense of talking to him about my research and segueway into a defense of our department . BARLETT ( To BECKS ) I know you value our work . BECKS I live for our work . BARLETT Okay . But I 'm afraid you 're missing the point . We 've got to solve this together , as a department . We 've got to get a plan . MURRAY ( To BECKS ) He 's still got your orgasm paper . God only knows what he 'll do with that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an adult male over 30 in a long time and , well , maybe I should . This is an emergency . I want to make sure we do n't lose our jobs . BARLETT It might do you good to talk to an adult male every few years . It 's true . But now ? p. 18 MURRAY I 've got it . Maybe we should file a sexual harassment charge with the Dean 's Office . BECKS ( Quietly ) Based on what ? BARLETT ( Angry ) You know he 's harassing us . It 's a great idea . BECKS The Dean might not like it . Things are already bad enough . MURRAY Oh , for Christ 's sake . Are you with us or not ? BARLETT It 's a brilliant idea . And it 's practically true . BECKS Yes , yes , of course it is . I 'm just trying to think of our options Samuelson is the Dean 's darling . BARLETT Nothing good ever comes without a fight . Now , unless you 've got a better idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just mention the possibility of a suit . MURRAY Shall we vote ? BECKS Wait , wait , wait , wait Ca n't you give me a few days ? I think we 've got to try to use the existing political channels . I 'm sure I can come up with an alternative . Please BARLETT There are no alternative political channels . That 's why this department was created , for God 's sake ! p. 19 MURRAY Well , I 'd like to see you come up with something , Becks . Because we 're all in trouble . And I 'd appreciate a sign of your loyalty . You 're starting to worry me . I 'd really appreciate a sign of your sisterhood . Meeting adjourned .

DAD , an affable man in a business suit , arranges a few wrapped packages on the table top , and smiles at his wife . Then he surveys the restaurant scene : ) DAD There she is . ( He waves . ) MOTHER Good . She 's early as usual . Be sure to tell her how pretty she looks . DAD I will . ( Looking at packages . ) I sure hope she likes these things . It 's hard to know what a woman wants these days . MOTHER I just hope she wo n't launch into a diatribe about how jewelry is ornamental and objectifies the wearer . That might scare Jerome . DAD He 's a lawyer . They do n't scare easily . MOTHER And they usually have a good vocabulary . ( BECKS enters , wearing the same suit she 's had on all day , which by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised her mother , she has not put on any makeup . Her hair needs a good , stiff brushing . MOTHER AND DAD stand as BECKS approaches the table . MOTHER starts humming " Happy Birthday " . BECKS smiles. ) p. 21 DAD There 's the birthday girl ! ( DAD hugs BECKS . ) Hi , Becky . BECKS Hello , Dad . Hi , Mother . MOTHER Hello again , dear . DAD Well , I 've never seen you look prettier . BECKS Really , Dad ? DAD I mean it . You look beautiful I hope that does n't offend you . MOTHER Au contraire . She is beautiful and she should be told . I 'm tired of acting like " beautiful " and " pretty " are swear words . My God , we must count our blessings on our birthday !

You know , I 've got to go to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca ? BECKS What for ? MOTHER To freshen up . Before Jerome arrives . BECKS Is he still coming ? Too bad . Mother , I 'm sorry . I do n't have any makeup . And I do n't care to impress this guy anyway MOTHER Jerome Phillips is an attorney now . You must remember him from some of those famous Phillips parties when you were young and still interested in the world . I do hope you 'll do your best to flirt with him . He 's single . ( Raises her eyebrows at BECKS. ) p. 22 BECKS Mother , I do n't know how to flirt . Be serious . Are you going to ruin my birthday with this coquette routine ? MOTHER It 's so easy . Bat your eyelashes and smile a lot . Show a little cleavage . BECKS Mother . MOTHER A joke . Just a joke . DAD He 's okay . He was pleased that we invited him . MOTHER ( Standing ) Imagine , what if you two get along and could date each other on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She tries to drag BECKS with her . ) The thought of it is making me dizzy . I need your arm for balance . Come on . BECKS Mother , please . I have n't had a date since I was an undergraduate . And I do n't want the constant pressure of having to please some man . Please do n't mention your expectations . DAD ( Stands ) There he is ! ( Waving ) Jerome . MOTHER ( To BECKS ) Shall we just pinch our cheeks , run our fingers through our hair and make the most of it ? Smile . BECKS For an attorney ? MOTHER Sssh ! p. 23 DAD ( Warningly ) Rebecca . ( JEROME enters , late 30 's . He wears an Armani suit and carries flowers . ) PHILLIPS Hello ! DAD Jerome ! Good to see you . Glad you could make it . How are you ? ( Extending hand . ) PHILLIPS Fine , fine . And you , sir ? ( Extending hand ) DAD Great , son . You remember Ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECKS dabs at her contacts with a napkin . MOTHER kicks her under the table . ) BECKS Oww . PHILLIPS Hello , Mrs. Babbitt . Remember me ? Have n't seen you for awhile . MOTHER It 's been too long . Of course I remember you . How is your family ? PHILLIPS Mom and Dad just got back from Cancun . Had a blast . My sister 's expecting her second child in April . Everyone 's just great . ( Turning to BECKS ) Rebecca . I barely recognize you . How are you ? Happy birthday ! ( JEROME hands BECKS the flowers . ) BECKS ( Taking flowers ) Thanks . ( With effort ) Thanks a lot . p. 24 MOTHER How lovely of you to bring flowers ! You did n't have to do that , did he , Rebecca ? BECKS I 'll go see if they have a vase . ( Starting to exit . ) MOTHER Darling , they wo n't have a vase . Worry about that later . PHILLIPS ( Flirting ) How old are you , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Jerome , you must never ask a lady her age . PHILLIPS ( To BECKS ) Well . if it 's part of your feminine mystery , then please do n't divulge it . Although I have to say you do n't look a day over 30 . MOTHER How romantic you are , Jerome . Is n't he , dear ? ( To DAD ) BECKS I 'm thirty-three and a university professor . PHILLIPS Really ? I 'll bet you 're mistaken for a student all the time . ( Before BECKS can react , DAD jumps in . ) DAD What 'll you drink , son ? I think I 'll head over to the bar and get our celebration started . PHILLIPS Scotch on the rocks . Can I help you ? p. 25 MOTHER No , no . I 'll do that . You two just catch up for awhile . Rebecca , I 'll bring you champagne . PHILLIPS Okay . DAD If you see our waiter  --  BECKS Waitperson , Dad . DAD Sorry , waitperson , if you see our waitperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha . Come on , George . ( DAD and MOTHER leave the table , exiting Stage Left . JEROME sits down . BECKS stares at a speck on the tablecloth , then looks up and smiles ever so quickly . JEROME points to the wrapped packages . ) PHILLIPS Looks like you 're getting quite a haul . Expecting anything in particular ? BECKS No They 're very generous . ( Another pause . ) PHILLIPS So . I never guessed that you would end up as a professor . BECKS Why not ? PHILLIPS I do n't know . When we were young , you were always so private and family- oriented . I thought you 'd be married by now and have four kids or so . BECKS So , you do n't think women belong in authority positions in higher education ? You do n't think female professors can be mothers , too ? p. 26 PHILLIPS I did n't say that  --  BECKS You implied that I did not fit the stereotype you had of who a university professor should be . PHILLIPS ( Pleasantly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that . You were such a homebody type and I do n't know , the word professor implies such experiential knowledge and wisdom . ( Laughing ) You 're young to be a professor . BECKS ( Dryly ) Not really . I 'm 33 . I graduated with a B.A. when I was 19 , got my Master 's by the time I was 21 , my Ph.D . by the time I was 24 and landed a fulltime tenure track position by the time I was 25 . PHILLIPS Oh , well , I see . What do you teach ? I 'll bet you ended up in Creative Writing or something . BECKS I 'm in Women 's Studies . PHILLIPS Oh , really ? What 's that ? I 've always wondered . I 've never known anyone interested in it . Do you discuss what women really want ? I 've been trying to figure that one out forever . And the crazy way that women think . Believe me , in my business , I meet so many tough , hard-hitting career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their work , but all they really want is to get married . They say one thing but they want something else . Hey , another thing I 've always wanted to know , if there 's such a thing as Women 's Studies , then why do n't we have Men 's Studies , too ? p. 27 BECKS Because your gender has maligned and abused women since the beginning of time , we 've had to create special curricula and studies in institutions of higher education to examine who women really are , and undo the damage you 've caused to females over the last 10,000 years in terms of psychology , intellect , education , politics , finances , socialization , and so on . We do n't have Men 's Studies because everything is the study of men . You are the dominant culture , the oppressor . Women are the oppressed . ( JEROME is taken aback . MOTHER AND DAD return , carrying drinks . MOTHER laughs gaily . ) MOTHER Hope you 're not talking about what I think you 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drinks . JEROME indicates that he wants to down his drink , but before he does , DAD proposes a toast . They all raise their glasses . BECKS reacts shyly . ) DAD To Becky ! Happy Birthday ! Here 's to many , many more . MOTHER Here , here ! PHILLIPS Unencumbered by the oppressors , let 's hope . ( BECKS chokes on her sip of champagne . ) BECKS I hope you 're not making a joke because this is a very serious subject to me . ( There 's an awkward pause. ) p. 28 DAD Well . So . Shall we look at the menu ? MOTHER Let 's . Please . Please . ( DAD passes out menus that have been sitting on the table . BECKS drinks her champagne . JEROME stares at BECKS and then drinks his drink quickly . All peruse the menus . ) MOTHER The chicken looks good , does n't it ? But I think I 'll go for the lamb Tell us about your practice , Jerome . PHILLIPS Well , I represent the archdiocese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on involves George 's firm . I 'm getting a kick out of having a chance to work with him on a project . DAD ( Winking ) That Jerome 's a real fighter in the ring . MOTHER How interesting . BECKS What other kinds of things do you handle ? Defending a patriarchal tradition that excludes women from the priesthood ? DAD I think I 'll get the lobster . PHILLIPS It has its exciting moments , Rebecca . You know , I think I 'd really like to know what womanly things you teach to our privileged youth . How do you give them the skills to overcome the horrible , trangressions we 've inflicted on you women ? p. 29 BECKS If you 'd really like to know , hand me your napkin and I 'll draw some pictures of orgasms . PHILLIPS You 'll what ? ( Choking on ice ) MOTHER Rebecca . Ca n't you ever stop with this feminist crap , will you excuse my French ? DAD Becky BECKS Basically , you see the world differently than I do , Jerome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only see the world monomanically , while as a woman , I can see it through mutuality , with many existing dimensions operating at once . ( BECKS starts drawing on her napkin and hands it to JEROME . ) Bang and it 's over for you . Boom , wave , boom , wave , boom for me . PHILLIPS And you 're paid to do this , at a university ? BECKS Perhaps you 'd like to sit in on a class sometime . If you 're not too old to learn something new . MOTHER ( Compensating ) Well , I certainly would be lost there . I 'm afraid it 's way over my head . You ca n't teach an old dog new tricks . And all this sex makes me blush to begin with . PHILLIPS Do you allow men in these classes ? BECKS My classes have averaged 4.3 men per semester. p. 30 PHILLIPS Only part of a man is left after taking your class or what ? MOTHER Ha ha . Very amusing , Jerome . ( To DAD ) I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts waving frantically . The WAITPERSON approaches the table and then promptly turns away , as if summoned to the kitchen . ) WAITPERSON I 'll be right back for your order . ( Exits ) DAD I 'm sure the uh waitperson 'll be back . MOTHER Let 's hope so . ( Clearing her throat . ) What do you hear from the old neighborhood gang , . Jerome ? PHILLIPS Do you remember Susie Begley ? The blond with who lived at the end of the block ? BECKS ( Slowly ) Linguini with white sauce for me . PHILLIPS She always got good grades . Anyway , she called the last time she was in town . She 's a stewardess now , after her divorce . I 'm in touch with her sometimes . And Frank Zimmer , he 's a doctor upstate . We still play tennis . His wife is an excellent tennis player . ( MOTHER tugs at DAD 's sleeve and he makes frantic waving motions with his hands , towards the kitchen. ) p. 31 MOTHER Rebecca is a good tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? BECKS Mother . It 's been years . What does Frank 's wife do ? PHILLIPS Do ? Oh , she 's a housewife . MOTHER How charming . They sound like people I could relate to .

BECKS stands in front of a blank chalkboard , drawing the following diagrams in this order as the lecture progresses : BECKS ( Referring to #1 ) There are also important differences in text and symbology . Let 's look at a model of women 's culture developed by two cultural anthropologists from Oxford , Shirley and Edwin Ardener Shirley and Edwin , right No , they 're not brother and sister . Wife and husband Their model is based on the assumption that the world is dominated by men . ( She points to the circle . ) This sphere represents the patriarchy , which controls all forms and structures of life , including language . Men run everything No , I 'm not talking about track . I 'm talking about the world , with very few exceptions ; and this stronghold controls the way in which our consciousness is expressed . ( BECKS moves to Figure #2 . ) Women , then , are obviously considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant culture as much as possible , but there exist areas which are outside of the experience of women . And always will be . ( She shades in Figure #3 . ) Male-to-male bonding is an important part of the patriarchy , and I think we all know the value of the buddy system , and the mentor-protege relations that function in the business world today . ( BECKS draws an X in this area . ) What ? Look , I paid a lot of money to be able to talk this way . Maybe you should bring a dictionary to class . ( Resumes lecture . ) Obviously , all language is of the dominant order , and if women express themselves , they have no choice but to use the language of the patriarchy . ( BECKS moves to Figure #4 ) There is , however , one crescent outside of the domain of the patriarchy , a place that can never be experienced by men , the area which falls outside of the boundaries of the patriarchal world , and therefore called " Wild " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone " Not as in " wild women " , no . Wild as in untamed raw nature , uncharted lands . The " Wild Zone " No , Jim , I do n't know where you could purchase T-shirts with this logo for your fraternity The " Wild Zone " correlates to area X in the dominant sphere . It 's a no-man 's land , a place forbidden to men . If we think about it in terms of consciousness , it presents an interesting picture . Area X , while outside of women 's experience , is known to women because they hear men talk about it all the time . But men can not know what exists in the " Wild Zone " . It is Female Consciousness , issues of birth , mothering , menstruation , female-to-female bonding . These topics are discussed by women authors through symbols of the wild ( BECKS takes a question . ) Yes Good question , David . Many men have written , rather successfully , about these events . But it was from an imaginary perspective only . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy , for women it becomes the place of revolution . Mothering , for instance , and the erotic aspects of a mother 's love , is acknowledged in works by women but threatens many men . The concept of sexual mutuality , between mother , child and mate , threatens the macho conception of loveone-shot monogamy . ( BECKS takes another question. ) p. 35 BECKS Yes ? ( A pause . ) You 're right , Megan , it 's really none of your business But I do n't have any children . So personally I do n't know what breast-feeding is like Okay , you 're right ; I do n't really know how it feels . I have to imagine what mothering is like . Just like a man does .

Ahead of your time and all that . BECKS Hello , Professor Samuelson . Yes . Thanks for agreeing to see me . SAMUELSON ( Pulls up chair for her ) Sure . Have a seat . Let me find your paper and then we can chat a bit . ( BECKS takes chair from him and sits . RAFE files through some papers on his desk and pulls one to the top . ) SAMUELSON You 're straight , right ? Just between you and me . BECKS ( Nervously ) Actually , I 'm circular . ( Motions to her paper , smiles. ) p. 37 SAMUELSON Oh , right . Right . I remember . And I 'm linear . You sit around counting orgasms in works by women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BECKS ( Coldly ) I see you have n't absorbed the tools for understanding female aesthetics . SAMUELSON I appreciate you aesthetically , Dr. Babbitt . ( She frowns ; he compensates . ) Just a joke . Do n't get defensive . Smile . BECKS Dr. Samuelson . Excuse me , but are we going to discuss my paper ? And the department ? SAMUELSON ( Serious ) Yes . Here it is . ( Holds it up ) You did n't prove anything in it . BECKS I believe there are exactly 25 pages of proof . SAMUELSON But none from legitimate sources . BECKS I used examples from popular works by women , the " vernacular corpus " if you will , to show how often romantic multiplicity is advocated by female writers , thus justifying my inference that these novels deserve to be considered as evidence of what 's most natural to modern women : a sociological correlation between pattern of orgasm and life view . This is in direct contrast to the patriarchal , self-serving , economic imposition of monogamy which began in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Samuelson . You need a new set of rules to understand the evolution of the politics of gender . I 'm providing you with the climactic criteria . p. 38 SAMUELSON Oh , cut the polysyllabic bullshit . And call me Rafe . I 'll call you Becks . BECKS Excuse me ? Polysyllabic bullshit ? SAMUELSON That 's what you go by , is n't it ? Becks for Rebecca . BECKS This is how I really talk . SAMUELSON Dinner , Becks , sometime ? We 'll talk androgyny . BECKS I 'd heard that you were harsh but I did n't expect this . SAMUELSON What have I said ? BECKS Dinner ? SAMUELSON You have to eat , do n't you ? BECKS I decline your invitation . Can we get back to the paper ? If you 've got any suggestions , I 'd appreciate specifics , because the convention is only a few weeks away and I 'd like to get back to work as soon as possible . SAMUELSON ( Standing ) What 's with your department ? Why do you three women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading bizarre papers about kinky things that ca n't be proved ? You represent this university . BECKS Our methods are a little different . We 're a special department and we need some understanding . p. 39 SAMUELSON ( Opens her paper , points : ) Where 'd you get these diagrams from ? The Joy of Sex ? After all , we do have an affiliation with the Episcopalians to consider . Becks , I 'm sorry , but I 'm going to have to pull this paper from the convention . It 's for your own good , really . You 've got to get more proof . As is , you 'll be laughed off the podium . There 's nothing here that shows that ( He reads : ) " Love , for modern women , is always expressed in mutuality and multiplicity . " Mutuality ? Multiplicity ? What the hell does that mean ? BECKS Women dominate the current fiction scene . Their work is reaches the masses . Popular acceptance of these works shows the genesis of multiplicity . SAMUELSON ( Pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy off grocery racks . Next you 'll extol the virtues of Harlequins . Or the National Enquirer . BECKS ( Smiling ) These authors make a lot more money than you do and reach more people with their ideas . That 's the point . Vernacular corpus . SAMUELSON Vernacular corpus . Multiplicity . Jargon , Jargon . What does it really mean ? BECKS It has to do with the nature of women 's love , if you will p. 40 SAMUELSON ( Scoffing ) Love ? You do n't seem to know the first thing about love . Your paper lacks passion , it has no heart or soul . BECKS My tone is clinical due to the nature of the material . It 's quite arousing , to some people , to think about the interpersonal dynamics of the theory of multiplicity how modern women need more than just one love , in fact , many loves , to be fulfilled . SAMUELSON ( Laughing ) That 's the point ? That it takes four boys to fulfill the modern , superwoman ? Oh , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the eighties , traceable to the sixties , in fact And it warrants further study It 's a trend of the 90 's . SAMUELSON ( Pauses . ) Look , do you know any woman who lives like this , a la multiplicity ? I mean , really . With AIDS and everything . Do you know any women who have three or four boyfriends each ? These days , a woman is lucky to get any man at all . BECKS Well , no , I 'm not exactly prepared to name names SAMUELSON And you certainly do n't live this way . BECKS How do you know ? ( He starts to answer , then closes his mouth and composes himself. ) p. 41 SAMUELSON There is not a shred of evidence here , only theory . You have n't proven that women live or feel this way . You feminists drive me crazy , always saying that men do n't understand this or that about women : " What It Means To Be A Woman . " So you give us yet another weird theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify your own poor use of structure , or lack of intellect . Or tell us some SAMUELSON ( Continued ) half-cocked notion that women can use both sides of the brain and men only use one side Whatever . I 'm tired of these excuses . Either you can find women who live and feel this way , or you ca n't . Do n't give me strange coincidences from the bestseller list and call it a trend or a theory unless you can name names . Get off your butt and quit counting orgasms . ( He hands her paper back to her . ) Here . Sorry . You 'll have to find another topic to investigate . Try looking into Emily Dickinson .

JO paces around the table , while BERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informally on the progress of her class . ) BARLETT ( Acting story out ) So yesterday we came to the Virginia Woolf section on patriarchy versus matriarchy . And when I said the word matriarchy , there was this horrible , loud moaning from the back of the classroom . Like this : " Aaahhhhhhhhh . " I stopped , thinking someone was hurt or dying . I said , " What 's wrong back there ? " Everyone turned to stare at the unfortunate young man who 'd groaned . He said " Sorry , it 's just that word That word " I stepped away from the podium and walked right up to him : " You 'd better get used to the sound of it . Matriarchy , matriarchy , matriarchy . " He shuddered each time I said it . I 'd never seen anything like it . MURRAY You 've given him nightmares . There may be grounds for a new genre here . Think of the possibilities . A new Stephen King novel especially for chauvinists : The Matriarchy . BARLETT " Supernatural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what they think all work by women is , anyway . p. 43 BARLETT Remember . " The pen is a metaphorical penis in the hands of a woman . " MURRAY And so our words come . Ha ha . ( BECKS enters , carrying a notebook , obviously agitated . ) BECKS Sorry I 'm late . Got held up after class . BARLETT ( Closing notes ) You have n't missed a thing . Just a simple story of another man who 's afraid of Virgnia Woolf . So how 'd it go with Samuelson ? BECKS ( Sitting ) You wo n't believe it . At the outset , he told me to smile , and then asked me to dinner . When I declined , he ragged on my orgasm paper and pulled it from the convention . MURRAY ( Stops pacing ) My God . BARLETT He asked you out ? BECKS He asked if I would have dinner with him to discuss androgyny . I said no . Then I tried to get him to talk about our department . MURRAY ( Excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to the dinner invitation  --  he pulled your paper . This is it ! You 've done it . You 've answered all our problems ! Thank God , Becks ! ( She hugs BECKS. ) p. 44 BECKS What ? BARLETT You poor thing . You 've been harassed . I 'm so sorry . MURRAY Now we 've got the grounds for a suit . Now we can get rid of Rafe Samuelson once and for all . BARLETT Court room here we come . MURRAY At the very least , this will give us some negotiating muscle . Perhaps he wo n't want this taken all the way to the Dean . Perhaps he 'll be willing to talk turkey on a number of key issues . Or else . BARLETT But if it does go to the Dean , it 'll be your word ( correcting herself ) our word against his . Tricky . MURRAY Not if we play the press right . Maybe I can catch my attorney tonight at home . This is going to be very big . BARLETT ( With notepad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone see you go in or out ? Students ? Custodian ? BECKS No one . MURRAY I 've waited a long time for this moment . He was too young to be promoted to division head in the first place . They called him the " Boy Wonder " , the Humanities Wunderkind . I ca n't wait to hear what they 'll have to say about him now . p. 45 BECKS Wait a minute You know BARLETT What ? BECKS There was something . Something he said . That could work for us . He wants us to do research and he gave me an idea . BARLETT You 've just saved our department . Now you 've got another idea ? BECKS It 's a mistake to go to the Dean . We 've got a chance to beat Samuelson at his own game ! In a legitimate way . MURRAY How ? BECKS I can get Samuelson to give us the funds for a new research project . In fact , he suggested this research himself in the meeting . When he funds us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . After we 've done the research , it would be sheer idiocy not to let us present our papers at the convention . After the university has paid for the research , they 'd want the national recognition . We can make sure the Dean sees the results of our study . So we can solve two problems with this one project . BARLETT ( Skeptically ) So what did he suggest that you 'd consider doing ? BECKS He has a valid point . So to speak  --  MURRAY I doubt it  --  p. 46 BECKS  --  About my multiplicity paper . He suggested that I " get off my butt " and find some women that truly live by the standards of multiplicity . He said that I should find proof , name names . And I want to . I want to prove my theory . MURRAY ( Interested ) Okay . Okay , this has possibilities . How will you go about it ? BECKS Talking to women . Talking to men about women . I 'll start with Social Services downtown and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper asking for participants MURRAY I 'd love to see you decide what to advertise . " Former Child Prodigy Now University Professor Seeks Chatty Nymphomaniacs . No Prostitutes , Please . " BARLETT Becks , be serious . You do n't even know the " S " word , let alone the " F " word . You barely know the " O " word . And I could never teach you the " C " word . How are you going to communicate about such private things ? BECKS I speak English . I 'll observe and interview in the field . In offices , in day care centers , in churches , in places of socializing BARLETT Those are called bars , Becks . And while you 're at it , you should try Chippendale 's and S&amp;M paraphernalia shops p. 47 MURRAY Interesting  --  BECKS Why not ? I want to know what modern women do . What do they feel ? I lecture about it all day long , but I do n't know what women want , I do n't know about their passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay ? Do you realize what this means ? You 're going to have to work a lot at night , and engage people in conversation . You understand ? You 're going to have to get women and men to tell you the truth about love and sex . MURRAY You ca n't just walk up to women in your suit , with a yellow pad in hand and a pencil behind your ear , and say " Becks Babbitt here . Help me with my multiple orgasm theory . Do you love more than one person ? " you 're going to have to gain their trust . That 's going to take time . BARLETT You 'll have to build relationships . You 're going to have to learn a new lexicon , use monosyllables , and grunt like everybody else does . And you 're going to have to chat with their business partners , lovers , and friends , about sordid , emotional and physical details . Are you sure you know how to deal with this ? MURRAY Berry 's right . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BECKS I 'll go buy a pair of jeans , if that 's what you mean . And watch some television . p. 48 BARLETT ( Shaking her head ) You may even have to wear makeup and shave your legs . It 's going to be very disgusting . You 'll have to observe mating rituals firsthand , revolting things like flirting and kissing . Dangerous caveman behavior . I 'm not sure you can handle it . MURRAY ( Making up her mind ) Look . You think Samuelson will okay this . Great . Let 's find out . No other university has publicized such a project . I think we 'd have a first . If your findings can corroborate your theory , that women need multiple loves in order to find happiness , we 'd have a real coup . Our status would be elevated considerably in a number of important arenas . It 's a risk , but it beats a Dickinson redux . Berry ? BARLETT ( Sighing ) I guess we can always fall back on blackmail later . I just hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a virgin barfly . BECKS My mother is always telling me to get out and meet people . MURRAY Of course , you wo n't be in this all alone . We 'll function in whatever way you suggest . Collect data , transcribe interviews . Bank the stats . Besides , Berry can show you the ropes of the mating scene . She 's divorced . BARLETT Thanks , Jo . p. 49 MURRAY You know more about it than I do . BARLETT Becks , when was the last time you went to a bar ? BECKS Seventy-three . I walked into one when I was looking for a dentist 's office . BARLETT Great . This wo n't be easy . I 'll have to make a list of the top 20 bars in town and take you to all of them . You 'll have to go shopping , too . MURRAY You 're going to be surrounded by gormless " Girlie  --  Women " . BECKS What are those ? MURRAY Decorous women who exist only for their men . They have nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear lipstick and short skirts . It 's a phenomenon of the eighties . I 'm writing a new book on it . It 's called The Tart Syndrome . BECKS That sounds like a living hell . Twenty bars and shopping . Lipstick . Pastry . But I 'll endure it all for the department . BARLETT ( Hands her the phone ) Oh , God . We 're making history here . Make the call . ( BECKS punches numbers and waits while it rings . BERRY and JO watch . ) BECKS ( Into phone ) " Yes , is Dr. Samuelson in ? This is Professor Babbitt of Women 's Studies calling Thanks Rafe , this is Becks Babbit . I 'm following up on our meeting yesterday . I 'm accepting your recommendation . After thinking it over , I find I agree with you . My theory does need substantiation .

See that man up at the bar ? You need to go talk to him . That 's why we 're here . You 're acclimated . Primarily , use colloquial expressions in your speech " Like " " Kind of " " Really " Modify like crazy . p. 52 MURRAY Mating is always vague . In fact , the more vague you can be , the more romantic everyone thinks you are . " I love you " is a very vague expression . For instance , " I 'll love you forever . " Like when 's that ? Could you be more vague , please ? BARLETT ( Gives JO a look ) One thing at a time , Jo . ( BERRY primps BECKS ' clothes . ) You look fine . It 'll help when you wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for now , it 's an improvement . Your hair Well , are you ready to make your move , Becks ? This is an important step . BECKS What do you mean , make my move ? BARLETT That 's a figure of speech . BECKS What 's a figure of speech ? MURRAY Make your move , already . BARLETT You be quiet . You were n't even supposed to come . MURRAY I 'm doing Tart Syndrome Research . Let me concentrate . BARLETT Becks , go up to that man and sit by him . If he looks at you and smiles , then say something . BECKS Why ? BARLETT To talk to him . p. 53 BECKS Why ? BARLETT Because that 's what people do in bars . You 've got to get the hang of this . You 've got to learn how to talk to people . If they smile at you , you can talk . If he does n't smile , smile at him and then see if he 'll smile . Then talk . Bat your eyelashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your legs apart . ( BERRY stands and shows BECKS how to stand . ) Now , you 're very loose .

I 'd appreciate it if you do n't move in on him . He 's divorced and earns six figures . I do n't get good benefits here and I 'm really looking for a situation with more security . BARLETT No problem . Our friend here is just going to go talk to him . BARTENDER Why ? Does she know him ? BECKS No . I do n't know him . I do n't talk to strange men . I do n't know any men to talk to . ( BARTENDER looks at the 3 of them . ) BARTENDER You want to talk to him , for thrills or something ?

He brings his beer . ) TALK SHOW HOST I do n't mean to be rude , but I overheard some of this conversation . I 'm very tuned into conversation . BARLETT Hello , Mr. Davis . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is Jo Murray . TALK SHOW HOST Right . Hello . I heard the word syndrome , and of course , my interest was peaked . MURRAY Naturally . TALK SHOW HOST Unfortunately , I just lost my job today . BARLETT I 'm sorry . You 're a Democrat and it was nice to listen to a Democrat 's talk show  --  TALK SHOW HOST Please . You flatter me . BARLETT No . Really . TALK SHOW HOST If only there were more people who felt the way you do . I lost my job today , and old habits die hard . The word syndrome has an almost Pavlovian effect on talk show hosts . MURRAY I 'm the one who 's working on the syndrome . But we 're here for something even better . We 're professors . p. 58 TALK SHOW HOST Three faculty members out on the town ? MURRAY We 're hear to show Becks how people behave in the current social climate . BARLETT Let 's cut the crap .

This is my problem , Mr. Davis . All I really need is to learn interviewing technique . TALK SHOW HOST I know how to talk . Believe me . You can model this . All right ? ( THE BARTENDER eyes them suspiciously . ) BECKS All right . TALK SHOW HOST " Today my guests are professors from a university that must remain unnamed in order to preserve their anonymity " p. 59 MURRAY Ha ! TALK SHOW HOST Okay . Seriously , the rules are , make your guest feel comfortable . Relate to them . Look at them . Try to feel what their deepest feelings are and give them an safe arena to express themselves . For instance , looking at you ( He looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angry even . I 'd try to get you to talk about your pain . Why are you angry tonight ? BECKS Because this is embarassing . TALK SHOW HOST Then you start the five " whys " . As soon as you get a statement like that , ask " why " as many times as it takes to get the answer from the interviewee . You may have to paraphrase it . But ask five times before giving up . Why are you embarassed ? BECKS Because this is silly . I 'm an adult woman . I should n't have to go through this . TALK SHOW HOST Why ? BECKS Because I 'm  --  shy . TALK SHOW HOST Why are you shy ? MURRAY That 's four . BECKS I 'm shy because ( An outburst : ) Because I did n't get a chance to learn how to socialize because I was more intelligent than anyone else . I was raised to be the best in the class . I was gifted and I had to use it . The teachers warned my parents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the right answers . I could never be wrong . It always falls to me to be the brightest . And after 30 years of that , it 's annoying . I 'd like to be able to forget about that after awhile . I 'd like to be able to enjoy something . I 'd like to be able to let someone else take the load . p. 60 TALK SHOW HOST ( Quietly ) Why ? BECKS Because life should be an interaction . That 's why I went into teaching , so I could share my knowledge . And instead , all I do is educate those who are n't as smart as I am ; I do all the giving , and no one knows how to give back to me . And I 'd like to receive something else , from the other side of life . TALK SHOW HOST You 'll have to listen to them before they can give back to you . Goodnight . Join us again soon , folks .

BECKS ( Nervously ) Berry , I do n't know about this . It was n't so hard talking to women . But now I 'm going to have to really communicate with strange men . For hours at a time . And it 'll be preserved on tape , for posterity . A constant reminder of my conversational inadequacies . p. 62 BARLETT Let 's just start there . You 've got to use smaller words . Something like " crappy way of talking " . They 've got to be able to understand you . These are men . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it should work . I 'll sit outside the door and help them fill out our form . I 'll tell them how much we appreciate their participation in this study . I 'll chat with them and put them at ease . BECKS Okay . I think I 've got that . BARLETT Then I 'll send them in here and you take it away . I think you should limit these initial interviews to a short time period . BECKS Like what . Ten minutes ? BARLETT Stretch it to fifteen , to make the subjects feel like you care about their answers . BECKS Sure . Sure . Fifteen minutes . That 's 900 seconds . How do I start ? BARLETT Introduce yourself .

How did I get myself into this ? BARLETT You 're doing it to help women . And to help men understand women . BECKS From what I saw at the bar , they do n't need any help . BARLETT You 're trying to save our jobs , remember ? ( A door opens , offstage . BERRY moves , to peak through the door , outside . ) BECKS I think I heard male footsteps . BARLETT Someone 's here . Ready ? ( Crossing back to BECKS . ) BECKS ( Trying to reassure herself ) Let 's trade places . You do the interviewing . You 're so much better at it . ( BERRY pats her on the back . ) BARLETT I 'd better send this guy right in and have him fill out the form afterwards . We do n't want to get behind . Be tough , kid .

But first of all , I do n't take dumps in the morning , and second of all  --  p. 64 BARLETT I 'm right outside if you need me . ( BERRY exits . BECKS paces for a few seconds . Then she sits down on the table . She feels too self-conscious doing that . She pulls out a chair . She sits , and feels that she 's not in enough of an authority position . She stands . MAX enters , wearing artsy clothes and boots . He 's very attractive . ) BECKS Greetings . I mean hello . MONTALI Hi . ( Stands . ) BECKS ( Stiffly ) Please , have a seat . MONTALI Thanks . BECKS I 'm Becks . Becks Babbitt . ( Extends hand . ) MONTALI Max Montali . Becks , is it ? BECKS Yes . MONTALI Unusual name . BECKS Well , it was Rebecca . But I changed it . A few years back . MONTALI Why ? BECKS ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca is a name with a feminine ending . I feel there 's a danger in being too feminine in today 's world . And Becky sounds like a child 's nickname . I wanted something that had some power and was androgynous , like my colleagues . p. 65 MONTALI Becks . It 's rad , all right . But you should n't be afraid of being feminine . There 's a lot in power in the female side of the brain . That 's where all my art comes from . BECKS You 're an artist . What do you do ? ( She jots down some notes . ) MONTALI I 'm a performance artist . BECKS ( Blankly ) What 's that ? MONTALI I ca n't explain . You 'll just have to experience it . BECKS Okay . Well . I guess my colleague explained what we 're doing already . Why do n't we get started ? If it 's okay with you , I 'm going to record your answers to a few questions . MONTALI As long as you preserve my anonymity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my word . MONTALI Scout 's honor ? BECKS Yes . Scout 's honor . ( She smiles and turns on the tape recorder . BECKS looks at her list of questions . ) Well , Max , as you know your friend Kate referred you to us , and I 'd like to ask you some questions about your relationship with her . If at anytime you feel uncomfortable responding , please tell me and we 'll go on to the next question . p. 66 MONTALI Okay . ( BECKS shifts uncomfortably . Throughout the interview , there is an interesting physical dynamic that takes place between the body language of both BECKS and MAX : There is chemistry . ) BECKS Where did you meet Kate ? MONTALI In a sex shop . BECKS In a sex shop . MONTALI Yeah . Kate was there looking for something to use that night and I was there looking for some prick pieces . BECKS Some prick pieces MONTALI For my art . I was doing very sexual pieces that year . She noticed I was picking out dildos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an artist . We struck up a conversation . We 've been friends ever since . BECKS You say friends . Would you categorize your relationship as " sexual , emotional , spiritual or intellectual " ? Or any combination of the above ? MONTALI At first it was sexual . Then it changed to intellectual , spiritual and emotional . BECKS Multiple responses . Interesting . MONTALI We do n't sleep together anymore . p. 67 BECKS ( Getting brave ) Why not ? MONTALI I guess she 's sleeping with someone else . Some guy named Jim . A musician . BECKS And does that bother you ? Do you feel jealous of Jim ? Does that make you angry at Kate ? MONTALI ( Rising ) At first I was a little jealous . Sure . And hurt . But she should do whatever works . And since we 're still close , it 's okay . I never have trouble finding a lover . BECKS You know Kate 's other friends ? MONTALI A few of them . BECKS Would you say she has few male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MONTALI Many . A lot . BECKS If you had to categorize your feelings about the fact that she has so many male friends , would you say it makes you feel " like part of a gang " , " special " , or " it 's just the way it is " ? MONTALI Like part of a special gang , the way it is . ( BECKS smiles . ) BECKS If you had a choice between the following options , which would you choose : 1 ) That Kate see only one man , you perhaps , and be unhappy or 2 ) That Kate continue to have many male friends and be happy ? p. 68 MONTALI I 'd choose that she see only me and be happy . But I guess that is n't one of the options BECKS Not in this survey MONTALI I 'd choose Number 2 . Look . Becks . I 'm curious . Is the point of this whole thing that women are killing monogamy and ruining the institution of marriage ? BECKS No . But is that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill relationships because they ca n't understand women . I do n't think they know to listen . But what do you think ? BECKS I do n't usually talk to men . MONTALI Just usually jump right in , huh ? Times have changed , Becks . You 'd better watch that . Say , has anyone ever told you that you look like Gloria Steinem ? BECKS No . MONTALI ( Crosses to her ) You do . Around the mouth . ( He touches BECKS ' face . ) ( There 's a knocking sound . ) BARLETT ( Offstage ) Next appointment 's here . ( BECKS crosses away from MAX and turns off the tape recorder. ) p. 69 BECKS ( Awkardly ) Thanks very much , Max Montali . It was nice to meet you . Your responses were very interesting and will help make this study as thorough as possible by allowing us to include the feelings of male partners on the issue of multiplicity in love . ( She pulls out a card from her pocket . ) Here 's my card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about the nature of your friendship with Kate , please give us a call . MONTALI Look at this .

BARLETT Brace yourself for the next one . Referral #6 for Jill Tannon . BECKS Tannon Tannon ( Looking in files ) p. 70 BARLETT The Catholic secretary who feels so guilty ? BECKS Okay . Got it . ( Pulls file . ) BARLETT This is one of her four boyfriends . And Becks , I get the feeling that he does n't know about the other guys I do n't think she told him exactly what this is because he 's mystified by the questionnaire . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him for her and save her the dirty work I do n't know . Relationships are such a mess . Good luck . ( BERRY exits . JEROME enters . ) BECKS Jerome Phillips . ( She sits on table . ) Oh my god . PHILLIPS Oh my God . Rebecca Babbitt . ( There is a very awkward pause . ) BECKS Uh Uh How are you ? PHILLIPS I 'm awful . Can you tell me what exactly is going on here ? I was very uncomfortable before but now that I see you , I 'm feeling close to death . BECKS ( Trying to be business-like ) This is my research study on the nature of multiplicity in female love . You were referred to us by a Jill Tannon , who says you are part of a number of men in her life . She also indicated that your willingness to take part in this survey to discuss this er situation . p. 71 PHILLIPS Excuse me . What did you just say ? Part of a number of men in her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen , really , for the past 2 years . BECKS Maybe you should give Jill a call . Perhaps there 's been some mistake . PHILLIPS We met at mass , for Christ 's sake . She 's so devout ! BECKS I do n't feel it 's my place to disclose any more , under the circumstances . I 'm sorry you came all the way down here . Why do n't you get in touch with Jill about this , okay ? PHILLIPS I want you to tell me , Becky . Please . Oh , God . Is this a nightmare or what ? BECKS It 's Becks , not Becky . PHILLIPS Becks ? Like the beer ? BECKS Right . ( She crosses to him . ) Look , Jerome . I ca n't tell you anymore than I already have . You need to go talk this over with Jill . ( BECKS slyly turns on the tape recorder . ) PHILLIPS ( Upset ) I never want to see her again in my life ! Ca n't you at least tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill . ( She pats him on the back . ) She 's one of the top ten candidates in our study . p. 72 PHILLIPS Who are the other bastards ? I 'll kill them . Give me their names . Will they be in here next ? Has she been putting me at risk , sexually ? God , she 'd better have been using condoms . ( BERRY enters . ) BARLETT Is everything all right ? BECKS No . PHILLIPS ( Distraught ) No . Yes . No . BECKS Yes . ( To BERRY ) BARLETT You 're sure ? BECKS Could you bring Jerome a glass of water ? BARLETT Sure . ( BERRY exits . ) ( JEROME looks up . ) PHILLIPS Are you taping this ? BECKS You signed the release form , did n't you ? PHILLIPS God , did I ? I do n't know what I 've been doing . BECKS This is just for my personal use . Do n't worry . Your anonymity will be preserved . ( BERRY enters and hands JEROME a glass of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JEROME sits and drinks the water . BECKS rubs his shoulders. ) p. 73 PHILLIPS Er Becks . Please . Tell me . I 'm ready . Explain women to me . I want to listen . BECKS I 'm afraid you found my explanation too didactic on our previous encounter . I mean , I did n't think my ideas really interested you . PHILLIPS I ca n't take this . Please . I beg you . Explain women to me . Let me take your classes . Anything . I need women . I want to be good to them . Ca n't we get some coffee ? Or something ? Ca n't you give me a reading list ? BECKS I 'm so very sorry , Jerome . Really . I do n't know what to say . Obviously , this situation hurts you , and makes you angry . And I 'm so sorry . Maybe we can talk when you 're feeling better PHILLIPS I feel like jumping off a cliff ! She 's lied to me , all these years ! BECKS ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick cup of coffee . I 've never really done that . Your expression worries me . I 'm so sorry about this . You love her , do n't you ? PHILLIPS Yes . Yes . I do . ( BECKS turns off the tape recorder . She crosses to JEROME and gives him a hug . Big moment for BECKS as she decides what that feels like . BERRY bursts in . BECKS and JEROME pull apart . BERRY pulls back in surprise. ) p. 74 BARLETT Excuse me . My , we 've really made some progress , have n't we , Becks ? BECKS ( Stumbling ) It 's not what you think . We discovered remembered that we 're old childhood friends . BARLETT I guess the water helped . Guess what , Becks ? Rafe Samuelson is here to see you . He 's requesting a status report . BECKS Now ? BARLETT ( Sotto Voce ) Now . You 're better see him . He 's going through everything  --  BECKS ( To Jerome ) Can we take a raincheck on the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want this information . I want your help . BECKS Okay . Here 's my number . ( She gives him her card . ) PHILLIPS I hope our next meeting ends more happily . Goodbye . ( JEROME exits . ) BARLETT All we need is for Samuelson to come in while you 're smooching with the interviewees . BECKS I was n't smooching . Whatever it was , I kind of liked it . What does Rafe want ? p. 75 BARLETT Talk to him , please . I hate having him hang around . I 'm still pissed with him over the matriarchy paper  --  ( BERRY gives BECKS a funny look and then crosses to the door . She yells offstage . ) BARLETT Professor Samuelson ! You can come in , now . ( RAFE enters . ) SAMUELSON Becks . Hello . I hope I did n't interrupt anything . ( BERRY leaves . ) BECKS I could take a break . We 're in the middle of interviews . SAMUELSON How 's it going ? BECKS We just got started . SAMUELSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in particular ? SAMUELSON When ? BECKS Right now .

BECKS No . So . Do n't you prefer to grade papers at home ? p. 76 SAMUELSON That can get very lonely . BECKS ( Non-sequitor ) I think you 're going to find the results of this study eye-opening . SAMUELSON Really ? How have you set it up ? BECKS We did the prelims through references , and we 've built the case study around twenty women who have multiple love in their lives . Right now , I 'm talking to the men and women who are their loves . SAMUELSON You 're talking to the men ? BECKS Yes . SAMUELSON I ca n't wait to see these results . BECKS What 's that supposed to mean ? SAMUELSON Look , Becks , if this study lives up to its potential , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all learn something from it .

Imagine , her first real steady man in ten years . And we 're hear to meet him . DAD I 'm not sure we should be intruding . Maybe we should just leave well enough alone . It sounds to me like she 's been seeing this fellow for awhile and it 's going well . MOTHER It 's only been a few weeks since her birthday ! How long could they have been seeing each other ? DAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted us to meet anyone before does n't mean that this man is the one or anything . MOTHER You 're right . I hate to get my hopes up .

How ? BECKS Well , I look at all these men for different compartments . So it enables me to ignore the things that bother me . If I had to rely on Max for intellectual stimulation , I would be offended and bored .

She smiles . ) BARLETT Well ? Now what ? BECKS " Thanks for your help with Derrida . Let 's have dinner . " MURRAY Damn it . We both lost Becks , I hope I pray I beg of you Do n't tell us Rafe Samuelson is proposing BECKS Dinner . How quaint . BARLETT Are you kidding ? This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wining and dining you ? BECKS He 's with us now , now that we 've proving our intellectual mettle . We 're the stars of the Humanities Division . This grant is a huge success . Do n't forget our write-up in tomorrow 's campus news . We 're scoring points . This is a career high . He 's going to let me deliver the paper at the convention . And he thinks we can arrange a talk show date . p. 91 MURRAY ( Moaning ) Did n't we have some real business at hand ? BARLETT I ca n't get to business . I want to scream at Becks . Becks , Becks , what are you doing with all these men ? BECKS I 'm learning things . MURRAY What are you learning ? BECKS Different things from each . BARLETT Such as ? ( BECKS pauses to reflect . ) BECKS With Rafe , I 've learned how to be a better scholar . BARLETT You ca n't mean it . BECKS If scholarship is learning how to use the system in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Jerome , I 'm learning how to appreciate culture . MURRAY And we can guess what new positions Max has taught you . BECKS Max is also very artistic and domestic . BARLETT But now they 're trying to get you to get serious . Romantic dinners . Moving in . How can you be doing your best work ? You do n't have the time to grade classwork or prepare new lectures . I 'm sure you do n't even have time to do your laundry . Or cook a meal . p. 92 BECKS Max does it for me . MURRAY Max does it . BARLETT All these men want you . But we want you , too . MURRAY I do n't want to lose you . You 've saved us with your project . We should be celebrating . All of us . Together . BARLETT But you probably have a date in an hour , right ? BECKS No  --  BARLETT You did n't have to live this theory to prove it . You did n't have to throw yourself into it like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends . MURRAY And yourself . BECKS What did you just say ? MURRAY You did n't have to live to to prove it . BARLETT Becks , wake up . You ca n't deny it . You 've proved the multiplicity of love theory . MURRAY You have real affection for these guys , which is the only way we can define love in the academic world , anyway . BECKS Who said anything about love ? BARLETT You 're talking all around it . Am I going to have to teach you how to say that , too ? Love ? You spend all your time with these guys . All you do is talk about them . You just said yourself that they each fulfill different sides of you . Forget our test group . We 've got a first person account from you . p. 93 MURRAY You 've proved the " gang boyfriend " theory . You . Becks Babbitt . BECKS Oh my God . Is that what you think ? BARLETT Our female love goddess . BECKS Nothing can take me away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? You know , you look happier these days . MURRAY It 's been very disgusting . BARLETT You radiate . MURRAY All that sex . You do n't have to rub it in . BECKS I do n't need men . And I do n't think these men need me . MURRAY Prove it . BECKS Prove it . I 'm so tired of having to prove everything . There are some things that you just feel , you know ? BARLETT Are you starting to develop female intuition as well ? ( BLACKOUT ) p. 94 Act 2 , Scene 6 GIRL WONDERAct Two , Scene 6 ( A week later . At the convention . There is a single podium and a number of chairs , Center Stage . As characters enter , they chat and sit : MOTHER and DAD enter ; next MAX enters ; then RAFE with BERRY . Jo comes in . Other talking is heard . JEROME enters with BECKS . BECKS wears a pretty dress . BECKS starts introducing everyone , crossing to people as she calls their names . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max Montali . Rafe Samuelson . SAMUELSON Nice to meet you . MONTALI Hi there . BECKS Rafe is my boss . MONTALI Right . I remember you talking about him . SAMUELSON And what do you do ? MONTALI Her laundry . And her dishes . SAMUELSON Really ? BECKS Excuse me for a second . ( BECKS crosses to MOTHER and DAD , where JEROME is chatting . ) BECKS Mother and Dad , I 'd like you to meet Rafe . He 's over there . Jerome , I 'd like you to meet Rafe , too . PHILLIPS Who 's Rafe ? p. 95 MOTHER That 's Becks ' superior . BECKS Mother . DAD Her boss . MOTHER ( Eyeing MAX and RAFE ) He 's chatting with Max . PHILLIPS Who 's Max ? MOTHER The artist friend . PHILLIPS Oh , right . DAD She told you ? PHILLIPS We saw a piece of his at a gallery . A weird missle thing ( BERRY walks over to BECKS and pulls her aside . ) BARLETT You 're crazy . Look at everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JO joins their circle . ) MURRAY There 's so much machismo in the air that you can cut it with a knife . MOTHER Who 's this , Becks ? BECKS Berry , have you met my parents ? Jo ? ( She drags JO and BERRY to meet her parents . ) ( The group of people stand chatting in the center of the room . BECKS crosses to the podium . LIGHTS FADE on the room and a single spotlight shines on BECKS . Crowd noises are heard . AS THE VOICEOVER IS HEARD , BECKS studies her notes , as if she wants to speak , but can not . Her academic persona has taken over . This continues until the end of the voiceover , which must sound like it is in fragments only the keypoints are heard by the speaker herself as she says them . Her words echo and overlap , reverberate. ) p. 96 BECKS ( Overlapping ) The challenge was to prove something about the nature of women that could not be proven . To recognize a system that bucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Admitting the future of this difference , this ability to feel love in a different way because we are a different gender . The bravery to explore the ramifications of this idea . To see why women are like this . Take Case Study #1 . Take Case Study #4 . As in Case Study #9 . The way we saw Case Study #8 react . The way Case Study #10 put it . And why women must not be afraid to name this part of themselves . We must own it . Because we must use it . As in our case studies , most women were aware of this multiplicity in their souls , and tied it directly to mothering , and the reproduction of mothering , which involves love of child , love of partner . ( " And the reproduction of mothering " echos . BECKS pushes the microphone away and speaks extemporaneously . The BAR TENDER and the WAITPERSON appear , stand and listen . ) BECKS I ca n't end this paper without saying that my own reaction to this project went beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project that I began to breathe it . I began to see the world differently . I learned how to talk and feel . I learned to love . I had to ask , did I really love in patterns and series and waves ? I look out there today and I see all of you , all the patterns and waves that brought me to this very project , , and the love that has become its end result . What 's the significance of all this ? Does learning about female love matter ? I invite you to ask the population of half the world , and their mates , and their children , and see if we find out , together , as humans . Thank you . ( The lights come up . JEROME leaves right away . MOTHER AND DAD stand nervously , looking around . BECKS gets off the podium . RAFE starts towards her , then turns to walk away . MAX waits a bit and then exits , too. ) p. 97 BECKS Rafe , wait . What did you think ? SAMUELSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me what you thought ! Did I have enough evidence ? SAMUELSON You had enough evidence . I do n't think I can see you anymore . BECKS What ? SAMUELSON You proved your point . BECKS So then ? SAMUELSON If women are really like this , if they really need multiple partners or forms of love to be fulfilled , then I do n't want to know . BECKS But you told me to prove it . You told me that Women 's Studies had to name names . You said to spell it out so that men could understand . SAMUELSON I understand now . Your department is safe . But I do n't want to date you . You 're too dangerous . Now that you 've learned about how women love , perhaps you can find out how men love . Good luck . Thanks for a job well done , Professor . ( RAFE exits . MOTHER AND DAD give her a thumbs up sign . ) BECKS What did you think ? DAD You were controversial . Personally , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you want to live your life proving things like this , I think you 've got a bright future doing it . p. 98 BECKS Thanks , Dad . MOTHER We 'll call you . You 're busy . BECKS Did Jerome leave ? MOTHER Yes . He got very nervous . ( MOTHER kisses BECKS . MOTHER and DAD leave . JO AND BERRY cross to BECKS . ) BARLETT Congratulations . BECKS Thanks . MURRAY Wonderful job ! BECKS Was it ? ( She indicates the empty room . ) BARLETT What did you expect ? You 've just expressed a very threatening idea that cuts to the core of the existing patriarchal power base . BECKS Where 's Max ? MURRAY I do n't know . Cheer up . You 've made a splash . You 're the theory du jour . BECKS You know what ? I just realized something . I miss Max . BLACKOUT p. 99 Act 2 , Scene 7 GIRL WONDERAct Two , Scene 7 ( A few weeks later . BECKS is back in the classroom . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . She stands with ease in front of the board . ) BECKS Hello . I 'm Professor Babbitt . You call me Dr. Babbitt or Becks , that 's my first name , yes , right , like the beer . Whatever you wish to call me . Does everybody have a syllabus ? Good . I hope that makes you feel secure , even though I already know that it 's going to be changed . Take a look at those assignments . They 're going to end up cancelled , juggled around , topsy-turvy . But it makes us all feel good to have that paper in our hands , does n't it ? It makes us feel like things have order ; it wo n't rain unless the weatherman predicts it . But life is n't like that . And you know what , that 's what makes life worth living . That 's what makes it so exciting ! You do n't know what 's around the corner . You do n't what the future may bring . And that 's good . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , with wild things inside you to explore . Yes ? No , this is not dianetics . Welcome to Women 's Studies 203 , A Study of Contemporary Women Authors . ( She writes it on the board . ) That 's the name of the course , but I think you should spread this rumor around school . This course has changed . Yes , I 'm still teaching it . But its focus is entirely different . This course will teach you how men and women think . I 'm serious . All of you men , out there wondering about how to talk to a 90 's woman on a date , this is the course for you . You all had a mother , right ? So you 'll learn about what she taught you , and how women think . All you women who think your life will turn out very different than your mothers ' lives , this is the course for you . You think times have changed ? Have they ? We 'll find out . And after we discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at how they feel . Because when all the books are read , when the lights go out at night , that 's what keeps us breathing , and glad to be alive . ( MAX enters . BECKS stops . He sits in a desk chair . BECKS looks directly at him. ) p. 100 MONTALI I was hoping to add this class if it 's not too late . BECKS We have a lot of work . But I do n't think it 's too late . MONTALI Good . I think I 'm ready for this kind of work . BECKS Well , first things first . ( She draws the diagrams of orgasms on the board. )
