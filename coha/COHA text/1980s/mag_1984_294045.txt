After a bloody food riot , the President cancels a price hike <P> Tunisia has long seemed a gracious outpost of moderation and stability in the developing world : solidly pro-Western , extending a perpetual welcome to foreign sun worshipers . But when word came that the government was raising the price of bread by over 100% , the facade of stability cracked . Riots erupted last week , starting in outlying regions and spreading to the streets of Tunis , the capital . As mobs composed mainly of teen-agers and young men in their 20s rampaged through city streets , smashing shop windows and attacking post offices and banks . President <P> Habib Bourguiba , 80 , declared a state of emergency . <P> While gunfire sounded , police and army troops in Jeeps and armored personnel carriers fanned out through the city to quell the " bread riot . " The show of force finally brought an uneasy calm , but only after more than 50 demonstrators and bystanders were killed . Then , in a dramatic five-minute radio and television broadcast , Bourguiba announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread would drop immediately from 18 to 8 , he declared , while previous increases for such staples as pasta and flour would be reduced as well . " We are going back to where we were , " he said , fervently hoping that was so . Once again , thousands took to the streets , this time in frantic celebration . Waving baguettes , Tunisian flags and portraits of the President , the exuberant crowds shouted , " Long live Bourguiba ! " <P> Behind the bizarre succession of events there may have been considerably more at issue than the cost of bread-though rises in food prices have sparked riots in many countries . Despite Tunisia 's relatively prosperous face , it is still a country where the rich get richer . In the south , where the rioting began , peasants , mineworkers and laborers complain bitterly of their economic deprivation , compared with the higher standard of living in the more heavily industrialized north . <P> Throughout the nation the poor and the young have been especially hard hit by a lengthy recession and unemployment that exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooligans , but a substantial number were members of Tunisia 's underclasses , which until now have suffered in silence . Said a senior Western diplomat : " There is a Tunisia that has not benefited from economic development and that was usually hidden from view . Now they have shown that they are a substantial power for the first time . " <P> Bourguiba 's quick policy reversal has allayed their resentment for the time being . Late last week Bourguiba also fired Interior Minister Idris Guigah , who called out the security forces in the riots . But in defusing the violence , Bourguiba also took a step backward in resolving Tunisia 's long-term economic problems . The global recession and plummeting prices of crude oil , Tunisia 's principal export , have reduced revenues . The food subsidies , which would have cost the government an estimated $236 million in 1984 , were a sensible target for austerity measures and had been suggested by the IMF and the World Bank , as well as Tunisian economists . Instead , the cuts needed to keep Tunisia 's budget in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were destined to create jobs .
