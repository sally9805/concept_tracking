" It was , " Linda Brown Smith observed , " almost like Dad was still here , and I was reliving his days in court . " Back in 1951 , when she was a chubby third- grader in an all-black school , her father , Oliver Brown , was the name plaintiff in Brown v. Board of Education , the epochal case that rang down the curtain on legally segregated schools in the U.S. Thirty-five years later , the 43-year-old grandmother was about to take the witness stand as an intervening plaintiff in the very same case , charging that the public schools of Topeka had still not purged themselves of segregation despite the Supreme Court 's ringing 1954 decree : " In the field of public education the doctrine of ' separate but equal ' has no place . " <P> Smith 's dramatic day in court last October superficially seemed like a replay of history . Examined more closely , it was a measure of how far the nation has progressed toward racial equality since 1954  --  and the difficult distance it still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown raised the stark issue of legalized segregation , the concerns addressed by his daughter involved the ambiguous notion of " racial balance " in mixed schools and the lagging performance of some black pupils . Confronting this complex problem , both blacks and whites are split on whether more racial balance will help poor black students who are no longer separate but remain sadly unequal academically . <P> Compared with most Northern cities , as Smith concedes , Topeka has made huge strides toward integration of its schools since she was forced to walk five blocks to a pickup point , from which she was bused to all-black Monroe Elementary School , although all-white Sumner School was located just two blocks from her home . And unlike cities in the Deep South , where whites began a generation of resistance to desegregation , Topeka did not even wait for the court to rule before taking steps to amalgamate its black and white elementary schools . <P> Before the Brown ruling , Kansas drew a haphazard color line between its schools , prohibiting segregation of all but elementary schools in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , Smith had enrolled in a junior high school in which blacks and whites had attended mixed classes for more than a decade . Says she : " I basically had the same experiences I would have had if the decision had not been handed down . " <P> Other blacks , however , were quick to reap the benefits of the ruling . By the 1955-56 school year , more than half of all black grade-school children and two-thirds of whites were enrolled in mixed classes . By 1968 Linda 's alma mater , Monroe Elementary , had a 25%-white student body . By the 1986-87 school year , not a single Topeka school had a student body less than 6.2% or more than 62% black . Twice during the 1970s , the Federal Government surveyed Topeka 's schools and found them in compliance with desegregation policies . Still more striking were steady gains by blacks in the city 's school administration . By last year two of the seven members of Topeka 's school board were black , as were the school superintendent , the principals of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local teachers ' association .
