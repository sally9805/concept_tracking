European space officials watched nervously last week as a gleaming white Ariane 3 rocket awaited the final seconds of countdown on its jungle-ringed launching pad in French Guiana . While the Ariane program has generally been a success , three of its 16 missions since 1979 have ended in costly accidents . This time the European Space Agency 's unmanned craft carried a payload of two satellites worth a total of $200 million : G-Star II , owned by the U.S. communications company GTE , and Brasilsat S2 , a Brazilian counterpart . The countdown ran smoothly until just 4.9 seconds before ignition , but then a sudden computer foul-up scrubbed the mission . Ariane officials hope to try again this week . <P> The breakdown temporarily frustrated the eleven-country European consortium 's continuing effort to demonstrate its rocket 's reliability and clinch an even larger share of the lucrative satellite-launching business . Ariane has been the free world 's only active satellite carrier since the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28 , which put the U.S. program out of commission for a year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the launching market , a business worth at least $500 million a year . Between now and 1990 , an estimated 60 commercial satellites will need a lift into orbit . While the National Aeronautics and Space Administration struggled last month to find out the cause of the shuttle disaster , an Ariane launch successfully put two satellites into orbit . Before the accident , the shuttle held two-thirds of the market and Ariane had the rest . <P> Several entrepreneurs in the U.S. , along with government-run rocket . programs in Japan and China , now aim to give Ariane a run for its money . NASA , which previously tried to protect its turf by discouraging U.S. satellite- launching entrepreneurs , earlier this month came out in favor of private rocket services to take up the slack left by the shuttle 's interrupted schedule . Reason : Congress is worried that U.S. companies will become dependent on foreign satellite-launching services . <P> Until January 's accident , the space shuttle had been scheduled to carry aloft seven satellites this year and 19 in 1987 . That total included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a launching fee of up to $40 million each . Since NASA has scrapped that plan , several customers have started shopping around . Western Union was forced to postpone the June trip of its Westar VI , a 24-channel communications satellite designed to replace an older , twelve-channel model . GTE Spacenet had planned to send up its G-Star III , which would relay telephone and television signals , on the shuttle in November . Says C.J. Waylan , the company 's president : " We 're not abandoning the shuttle , but we 're not going to wait inactively either . We have customers to satisfy . " <P> Yet the only alternative at the moment is Ariane . The consortium has been so profitable , posting earnings of $24.3 million in 1985 on revenues of $200 million , that it plans to make a public stock offering by 1988 . The agency has just completed a second , $140 million launching pad on South America 's northeast coast that will double Ariane 's annual capacity from five missions to ten .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
