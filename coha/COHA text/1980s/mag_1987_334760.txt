If Bobby Knight had played a little more at Ohio State 25 years ago , college basketball might be a little seemlier today . By expert accounts , he was a better player than many people remember , though not as good as he thought . The trouble was , his college teammates in 1960 included John Havlicek , Jerry Lucas and Larry Siegfried , who went on in the pros to amass 14 championship rings . Knight began on the bench , and is still on the bench . His space in the Hall of Fame has been fashioned out of pine . <P> In order to start coaching at West Point , he was obliged to join the Army . PFC Knight earned $89 a month and all the cadets he could eat . Under an intemperate head coach named Tates Locke and an institutionalized system of hazing , Knight instantly burst forth as the most undisciplined disciplinarian since General George S. Patton , or at least Woody Hayes . By 24 , he was the head coach at Army ; by 30 , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Knight 's Hoosiers are the national champions for the third time in twelve years . <P> Hoosiers is a hard term to define , though a current movie of that name picks at the synonyms of Indiana , basketball and Knight . The opening scene of rural roads , buckets and barns is faithful to Knight 's picture of the place . Driving along , he likes to count the hoops . His best player , Guard Steve Alford of New Castle , learned to count on a scoreboard . Ever since Alford was a high school " Mr. Basketball , " the Midwestern equivalent of a peerage , even his regimen on the foul line has been as famous in Indiana as the frost . ( Touch your socks , your shorts ; one dribble , two dribbles , three ; shoot , swish . ) <P> The coach in the film , like Hayes at Ohio State , once punched a player and disappeared . But the object of his assault , much more like Knight , was his own player . Knight regards himself as a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no missionary . " The state of Indiana pays the corrections officer one salary and me another . Let him work with the incorrigibles . " Knight only treats them like incorrigibles . <P> " Do you think I 'm unyielding ? " he asks Dean Garrett playfully , clasping a fist to the back of his center 's neck . " No , " Garrett answers sheepishly . " Am I unyielding ? " he turns to Forward Daryl Thomas . " No , sir . " It is the eve of the title game , and the press invites Alford into the discussion . Socks , shorts , one , two , three . " I 've survived for four years , " he backs off in a panic . " I 've only got one more game . " Indiana won it , 74-73 , over the Syracuse Orangemen . Their perfectly competent but strangely insecure coach , Jim Boeheim , was slightly outflanked at the end of both halves . As always , Knight was worth a few points from the bench . <P> He reveres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Newell . When Clair Bee was 85 and blind , Long Island 's great coach painstakingly scratched out a message for Knight that read : " Clair Bee and Bob Knight do not believe that repetition is gospel . " Lately Knight , 46 , has actually dabbled in zone defenses and , as the euphemism goes , " broadened his recruiting base . " A junior-college transfer , Keith Smart , made the last two jumpers against Syracuse .
