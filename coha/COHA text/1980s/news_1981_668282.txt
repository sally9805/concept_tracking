Interest rates , which have plagued mortgage lending and currently have about 20 banks operating in the red , may be easing slightly , but few lenders expect any meaningful decline while demands for capital remain so high . The housing market is limping along , kept alive by seller financing , buydowns , banks willing to blend old mortgage money with new funds , corporate transfers and by two-income families determined to buy . Wesley Swanson , Winchester broker and bank appraiser , summed it up when he noted an inventory of l50 unsold houses in his community against a normal 40 to 50 , and price declines rarely seen . " A Victorian house , typical of this town , went on the market at $115,900 . There was no interest at $110,000 , none at $99,900 , and it sold at $92,000 . Another at $ll5,000 moved at $96,000 .

James Cofield , head of Malmart , said nearly half of their business involved buydowns with sellers or buyers putting up cash at closings to bring rates down to 15 1/2 the first year , 16 1/2 the second year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan enabled a couple to buy a Newton house , for example , when their monthly payment was reduced from $1070 to $728 .
