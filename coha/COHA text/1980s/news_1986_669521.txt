One of the best ways to get your garden going quickly is to buy young plants ( seedlings ) from a nursery or garden center . In many areas of the country , plants in containers are still available at nurseries , and may even be offered at a discount . I ' ll also show you how to start some plants from seeds. // // First you must decide what to plant in your garden . You can make yours exactly like mine , or try some experiments on your own . The crops I ' m growing are all things I like to eat or to look at , and that ' s one of the first rules of successful gardening : Grow what you like ( or at least what other members of your family enjoy ) . // Next you need to buy some supplies at your local nursery . You ' ll find that seeds come in small packets , and seedlings come in pots or in containers called ' ' flats . ' ' To make a garden like my square one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of these : peppers , eggplant , lettuce , and cabbage . You ' ll also need 4 dwarf marigold plants and 4 to 6 begonia plants . And you ' ll need one package of carrot seeds. // For your cage garden , you ' ll have to decide whether you want cherry tomatoes , pole beans , or cucumbers . I have three cage gardens and will be growing all three , but you may want to just choose one . If you choose tomatoes , buy seedlings . If you choose cucumbers or bean , buy seeds. // If your plot gets only a small amount of sunlight , you can experiment by planting lettuce , carrots , chives , and flowers such as impatiens and coleus. // The point is , we will all learn as we go along . Am I learning too ? You bet I am ! // Yours truly , // Peter Tonge // P.S. Next week we ' ll start some other smaller gardening projects . <> <> Supplies you ' ll need : // String // Watering can // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsheet // 20-pound bag of dehydrated cow manure // Small bag of vermiculite <> <> A. DESIGNING YOUR PATCH // Once you ' ve decided what you might like to grow in your garden , you need to know how many plants you can grow in each square foot. // In his book Square Foot Gardening ( Rodale Press ) , Mel Bartholomew lists the number of plants he has found he can grow in each 1-foot-by-1-foot square . <> <> Radishes , carrots , onions : 16 plants per square foot // Spinach , beets : 9 // Lettuce , Swiss chard , parsley , marigolds : 4 // Cabbage , broccoli , cauliflower , pepper , eggplant : 1 plant per square foot <> <> Here ' s what my 16-square-foot bed looks like . You can use this picture to show you where to plant your seedlings and seeds . P stands for pepper , E for eggplant , L for lettuce , C for cabbage , M for marigold , and B for begonias . The square with dots in it is for carrot seeds . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on. // Here are my cage gardens . What kind would you like to grow ? // Now you might think that some of the plants are too close to each other . But in the system we will practice , large plants will often be able to ' ' borrow ' ' space from one another . For instance a cabbage might encroach into the space occupied by a small lettuce , but by the time the lettuce starts needing all its space , the cabbage will have been harvested. // To design your square patch , mark off the bed into one-foot squares with string . Place one string every 12 inches , and stretch it from one end of the bed to the other , horizontally . Then do the same thing making vertical lines . Or simply draw lines in the soil with your finger instead of using string. // As you plant each square foot , take a heaping trowelful of the dehydrated cow manure and spread it evenly over the square . The manure is a fertilizer that adds nutrients , or plant food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your trowel or hand fork to a depth of about 3 inches . Now you ' re ready to plant . <> <> B. PLANTING SEEDLINGS // 1 . Plant them in the late afternoon or early evening so that they will have a cool night to help them adjust to their new surroundings. // 2 . Use your watering can to water the seedlings before you set them out unless you can see that the soil in the container is nice and moist . If you bought seedlings in a flat where several are growing together in one container , be as gentle as possible when you separate them . Some roots will tear off , but don ' t worry , new roots will grow fairly quickly. // 3 . Dig a hole a little deeper than the plant ' s roots . Fill the hole with water. // 4 . When the water has drained away , place the seedling in the hole and fill the hole with loose soil . Water again. // 5 . Leave a saucer-like depression in the soil around each plant to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomatoes in your cage garden , follow the same directions , but plant them several inches deeper , up to the first set of large leaves . Plant two seedlings inside the cage . <> <> C. PLANTING SEEDS // Now you can plant your carrot seeds in the square garden . And if you ' ve chosen to plant cucumbers or pole beans in your cage garden , you can plant those , too . Here ' s how : // 1 . Push your finger into the soil wherever you want a seed to go ( or you could use the end of a pencil or a short stick ) . The seed packets will tell you how deep the particular seed should go . Be careful not to plant seeds too deep or they won ' t germinate. // 2 . Drop in the seed and cover it with soil - or , if it is a very tiny seed , like carrot or lettuce seed , cover it with vermiculite to keep the seeds from blowing away . Vermiculite is so light that even the tiniest seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in deep enough so that you can water them with a watering can without any danger of washing them away . But for tiny seeds , I put a small square of cloth ( a piece of old sheet ) over the square to protect them , and then water them with a can . After that I keep the seeds moist by spraying them every day using a little window-spray bottle . Once the seedlings are up , spraying them every single day is no longer necessary , because they have developed roots that drink moisture from the soil . At this stage the roots are also strong enough to hold the tiny plants in place when you water them lightly with a can. // //
