The problem with the insurance , the sources said , is that at least some of the underwriters , each picking up a piece of the sum , were not aware when they covered the policy in recent months that the owners could implement unilaterally a plan that may well bring on a player strike. // And one source quoted an underwriter as saying that , as of yesterday , brokers had not even placed with underwriters $15 million of the $40 million total that appears jeopardized. // According to one of the sources , an emergency meeting of insurance companies - some that have pieces of the strike policy , and some that rejected it - was to have been held in Bermuda yesterday , one day after the executive board of the Major League Baseball Players Association voted to strike May 29 if the owners ' demand for increased compensation to teams that lose free agents is not resolved by then . But the meeting was postponed until today , the source said. // Insurance such as this is not a simple matter . A broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more companies , and one company may lay off some of the policy - much in the way bookmakers handle sizable bets - with other underwriters . In the case of the baseball owners ' policy , the transaction started with Lloyd ' s of London and then reached several other underwriters around the world. // Ray Grebey , director of the player relations committee , the owners ' labor unit , denied that there was any problem with the insurance . " I met with the brokers in my office yesterday , and there ' s absolutely no problem , " Grebey said . " As far as I know , there are no problems . The insurance is in full effect. " // But when Grebey ' s comment about his meeting with the brokers was repeated to a man who is familiar with the strike insurance matter , he said : " I doubt very much that the brokers would tell him . If in fact the coverage is coming off a bit , they would be out scurrying around trying to find guys to replace the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. " // A collapse of the bulk of the owners ' insurance could have a significant effect on their negotiations with the players . One insurance executive called the policy " a hammer the owners can hold over the heads of the players . " <> <> Owners Set Up Fund // The $50 million in total insurance - the first $10 million is apparently safe - is part of a fund the owners have established in the event of a strike . The fund was built with some of the owners ' television receipts and with contributions from each of the 26 clubs the last two years . Grebey said the net worth of the fund , including the insurance , was roughly $70 million. // The players association , it was learned , has also tried to purchase strike insurance but has not succeeded . " The owners did a good job of making it hard for the players to get insurance , " one industry source said . " They took out their insurance last October and used up the market . But if the owners lose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get something. " // The initial part of the owners ' policy , the part worth $10 million , has a 153-game deductible , about 12 days of major league games . It then would pay $100 , 000 a game , to a maximum of 100 games , which would be about eight days . The additional $40 million in insurance would take over from there. // The problem with that additional coverage , one source said , was that " the whole story wasn ' t told . " <> <> ' Something Has Come Up ' // This apparently presents no danger to the first $10 million because the owners have already paid half the premimum on it , a source said . But , he said , they have paid only a relatively small deposit on the additional coverage. // " It ' s possible that some companies won ' t honor their obligations because they weren ' t properly informed in the first place , " he said . " The controversy has come up because it ' s the second year in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the companies have said they wouldn ' t have gotten involved if they had known something. " // Last year , when the players threatened a strike for May 23 , the owners took out insurance of about $30 million . But the source said if there had been a strike and the owners had made a claim , they would not have been paid. // " A large European reinsurance company took a large bite of the insurance , " he said , " and walked away once they found out the implications of what was written . " <> <> Problem for Owners and Brokers // No one has said that Grebey or the owners have tried to hide from the underwriters the facts of the owners ' right to implement the compensation plan . Still , an industry source said , some of the underwriters did not know about that right until the players began seeking their own insurance in the last few weeks and told what he called " their side of the story. " // If the $40 million can not be placed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the matter could become a problem between the owners and the brokers who were responsible for placing the insurance . Whether the brokers , who like the underwriters operate in various countries , would have to pay off the policy themselves could become a legal matter. //  --   --  <> <> Grebey Gives Ball to Miller // Grebey said he would be in Florida beginning next Monday and thus would be available to resume negotiations with Marvin Miller , executive director of the players association , who will be meeting there with players. // But Grebey said it was up to Miller to initiate negotiations . " I didn ' t reopen the contract , " Grebey said . " The 26 clubs didn ' t reopen the contract . I plan to talk to him about a variety of things , but whether he wants to bring this up is up to him.
