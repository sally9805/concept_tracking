Yuri Andropov : 1914-1984 <P> A former KGB chief , it was said , would never be allowed to rule the Soviet Union . Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov confounded such predictions when he assumed control of the country 's Communist Party in November 1982 . Within seven months , Andropov had also secured the important title of Chairman of the Defense Council and been elected President of the Soviet Union . It had taken his predecessor , Leonid Brezhnev , 13 years to accumulate all the same trappings of power . The new Soviet leader , it seemed , was a man in a hurry . <P> Compared with the exuberant bear-hugging Brezhnev , Andropov appeared stern , almost ascetic in his thick glasses . He impressed Western visitors to the Kremlin with his command of facts , his sharpness of mind and his sardonic sense of humor . But somehow a sense of his true personality always seemed to elude them . The Soviet leader , French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson remarked after a trip to Moscow in February 1983 , was " extraordinarily devoid of the passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . <P> To the Soviet people , Andropov seemed a study in gray , as enigmatic as the fleeting smile he showed now and again in official photographs . Given Andropov 's years at the helm of the Committee for State Security ( in Russian , Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti , or KGB ) , some of his countrymen feared that he would turn out to be a reconstructed Stalinist , intent on imposing order on a society grown lax and corrupt in Brezhnev 's final years . Others wishfully thought that he might emerge as a liberal , eager to improve relations with the West and reform the Soviet Union 's cumbersome system of centralized planning . Andropov proved to be neither . Having taken hold of the reins of power late in life , he found his grip too feeble to alter the course of a nation of 271 million . <P> After Brezhnev 's long , debilitating illness , many in the Soviet Union had hoped that his successor would be able to project a reassuring image of vigor and strength . But as early as Andropov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many foreign dignitaries were struck by the telltale signs of frailty and age that belied his reputation for mental agility . During the visit of Finnish President Mauno Koivisto in June 1983 , Andropov had to be helped to his seat at a Kremlin banquet . When the Soviet leader met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl the following month , his eyes were clear and alert , but his right hand visibly shook .
