 | Four times during one marvelous Philadelphia evening last week , Pete Rose strode to the plate in search of a new place in the history of the game he loves . Each time , his adversary on the pitcher 's mound was the noble fast-ball master Nolan Ryan of Houston . His first time up , Rose lined a fast ball for a single . It tied Stan Musial 's National League career record of 3,630 base hits . The next three times the exuberant crowd of more than 57,000 stood to cheer Rose on to the record-breaker . But Ryan , the big gentle Texan who is the essence of power pitching , rose to the occasion . He struck out Rose three times . " Most of the pitches , I saw , " said Rose . " Some I only heard . After one curve ball , there was nothing to do but lay the bat down and admire the guy . " " I enjoyed pitching like that , " said Ryan . " He 's a battler and a challenger . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " Twenty-four hours later baseball was all about many other things : deadlocked negotiators and empty ball parks and a hopelessly disputed clause in the collective bargaining agreement between players and management . The issue was how to compensate teams that lose free agents . The reality , for the third time in history , was a baseball strike . But a few thoughts lingered about the last time that the Phillies and Astros might play for days or weeks or perhaps an entire silent summer . Grandeur : First , there was the fact that fans would miss , dearly , games like this one , in which Ryan succumbed to a back injury in the eighth inning and the scrambling Phillies rallied from a 4-0 deficit to win , 5-4 , for their own star pitcher Steve Carlton . Then there was the image of Rose , the 40-year-old boy who never stops hustling or enriching the game , pointing across the diamond at Ryan to salute him ? and Ryan gesturing back from the dugout in a moving display of mutual respect . And finally there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose-Ryan duel was not diminished at all by the fact that both heroes happen to be millionaires because they have @# taken advantage of baseball 's free-agency structure . According to some pro-management thinkers , Rose and Ryan may be examples of the overpaid , even greedy ballplayers who average $175,000 a year in salary and still dare to bring the game to a midsummer halt . Defenders of the players counter that such athletes fill ball parks , win games and create profits for the owners who ante up their huge contracts . It is difficult to support either argument with numbers , because a U.S. district-court judge ruled last week that the owners do not have to open their accounting ledgers in the course of these negotiations . That court decision also denied a National Labor Relations Board request for an injunction that would have postponed the strike . So baseball ceased last Friday , and the possibility loomed that an unusually brilliant spring of action might dissolve into a summer of sour recriminations and distant memories . Bob Boone , the hustling Philadelphia catcher and player representative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant about the strike . " Look at what guys like Rose and Carlton , Ryan and Fernando Valenzuela have given the fans so far , " he said . " Sure , we all want the show to go on . That 's been our contention all along . We agreed to take a step back from total free agency to keep the game going . But the owners wo n't meet us on the degree of compromise . They left us no choice . " " How do you explain the strike contingencies to players who ask you ? " Boone was asked . " I say , Have a nice vacation . You 're paying for it ' . " Stars : The issue of who should pay for baseball 's future has a brief , emotionally charged history . In the mid- ' 70s an arbitrator and a Federal judge struck down the old system in which a player was perpetually bound to his team by the reserve clause . In 1976 the owners and players agreed on a new system . A player with six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market as a free agent . Teams that lost such players were entitled only to amateur draft choices in return . Unfortunately for management , the owners proved unable to control themselves within the new framework . Some bid wildly for superstars and spear carriers alike . Contrary to some fears , the spending did not significantly alter the game 's balance of power . Clever investors like the Phillies and New York Yankees did thrive . But so did conservative clubs like Baltimore and Kansas City , while other big bidders in San Diego and Texas floundered miserably . Nevertheless , the owners claimed that the spiraling payrolls were leading them to ruin . When the agreement expired last year , they sought more compensation for teams who lost free agents . Both sides agreed to a year 's delay to work out a deal . But when the final strike deadline arrived last week , no progress  | was evident ? and the strike was still on . Despite some mild gestures toward compromise , the positions remain fairly rigid . The owners want the top half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a team signing such a player would have to give up its sixteenth best player in return . The players contend that such measures would discourage bidding for free agents who were less than superstars . The Yankees , for example , might cheerfully relinquish their sixteenth man to sign star outfielder Dave Winfield . But what owner would bid for a player who might arrive as his twentieth best talent ? if he had to give up No. 16 ? Direct Losses : The players counter that compensation should not come from a team 's 25-man roster . They have proposed compensation from a " pool " of marginal players to be designated by all teams ? so owners would n't fear direct losses from their own teams when they bid on free agents . They also suggest that they might accept a compensation formula if it applied to signing only the top 5 per cent of players rather than the top half . In a broader sense , some players fear that the owners ? armed with an $11 million strike fund and $50 million in strike insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its powerful leader , Marvin Miller . The owners retort that they merely seek some fine tuning that will keep their business operating smoothly and profitably . " This is an unnecessary strike , " says Ray Grebey , the owners ' chief negotiator . " Compensation is not really a strike issue . " " If they did n't think it was a strike issue , " asks Players Association counsel Don Fehr , " why did they buy all that strike insurance ? " There is a grim logic in the hard line of the players , who refuse to give up rights won in court just so they can help the owners control themselves . But there is also that huge war chest behind the owners ' hard position . Barring a concession on either side , the outlook is bleak . Asked if the situation was " hopelessly deadlocked , " mediator Kenneth Moffett said , " That 's pretty accurate . " In the wake of last week 's final futile talks , New York Mets player rep Rusty Staub talked about fan resentment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage on the streets , people get mad , " he said . " When there 's no baseball , I guess fans will get mad . We only hope they 'll understand that we never wanted this . " Certainly men like Pete Rose , who run and slide and battle for every dollar they earn , never wanted this . But when Pete was asked if he 'd get stir-crazy during a strike , his answer was revealing . " I 'll have an advantage , " he said , " because I 'll go home to Cincinnati and work out on some college or high-school facility . I 'll leave the legalities to the negotiators . I 'll still play ball some way . " His words , like his final duel with Ryan , may help some fans to understand ? and get through ? baseball 's empty days . 58
