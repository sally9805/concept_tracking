PEKING  --  China is about to embark on sweeping economic changes  --  most notably in its rigid , antiquated pricing system . The goal is nothing less than transformation of the economy , and the dangers  --  such as stirring severe inflation  --  are great . A party meeting in the next few days is expected to approve a comprehensive plan to begin reducing the role of the country ' s centralized planning system , giving greater freedom to workers to move from job to job , cutting back huge state subsidies for enterprises and workers , and , most important , beginning to overhaul a centrally administered pricing system that hasn ' t been addressed since the 1950s . Western diplomats here say the country ' s leaders envision a system under which only the most basic functions  --  steel and energy production , for example  --  ultimately are controlled , while market forces , perhaps under some state supervision , govern the rest . " I believe the significance of the forthcoming session will go down in history , " party leader Deng Xiaoping told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party meeting , the third plenum of the twelfth Central Party Committee , to the third plenum of the eleventh Central Party Committee . That meeting , in 1978 , set China on the road to modernization by inaugurating similar changes in agriculture , which have proved successful . But Western economic specialists caution that the much more complex urban economy will be vastly more difficult to reform . " It ' s terribly risky , " says one Western economist here . Mr. Deng said Wednesday that the innovations will take three to five years to succeed . Like other changes in the past few years , these are designed to address fundamental problems in the economy . China ' s factories are inefficient ; over 15% of them lost money last year , many because of state-administered prices that don ' t reflect their cost of production . Meanwhile , factories that benefit from outdated pricing churn out big profits . Subsidies to money-losing enterprises and to consumers eat up some 40% of the state budget and contributed to last year ' s $2 billion deficit . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ' s close to it , " says a Western diplomat . The exact shape the changes will take  --  and how sweeping they will be  --  isn ' t known . But many of them have been hinted at . During the meeting with the foreign scientists , Mr. Deng said industry , commerce , science and culture all would be tackled . The country ' s newspapers have been filled with stories extolling the benefits of giving factory managers the right to make and fill their own production plans . And a major document from the State Planning Commission described in the Economic Daily and in the English-language China Daily gave details of the kinds of changes to be expected . Starting next year , according to the planning commission , more than half the products now under state control would be put under general guidelines instead , or released to market forces . Products like coal , steel , and major agricultural products , which make up a big part of the economy , still would be centrally planned . Indeed , none of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enterprise autonomy , free-floating wages , even minor price adjustments . Chinese leaders have acknowledged since as early as 1980 the need for comprehensive price changes , but haven ' t been ready to give the subject major party backing . Although the government in theory now oversees economic matters , " without the party , the programs are dead , " says one Western diplomat here . Party officials clearly think the time is right for a major push . Despite its problems , the economy is in its best shape in decades , the social situation is stable and Deng Xiaoping , the force behind change , at 80 years old , is still vigorous . But potential problems are legion . There is the risk that the powerful but aging Mr. Deng simply won ' t have the muscle to carry out major changes . By trying them he risks his own power , that of his successors Zhao Ziyang and Hu Yaobang , and the prestige of the party . Over 80% of the country ' s industrial production is under direct state control , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central planning has created groups that won ' t easily give up power . Western observers also caution that any major steps that smack of capitalism , as do these , risk stirring up political opposition that is very much alive , but so far has been tamed . The Chinese themselves are well aware of one of the most serious problems : inflation . Even minor changes in the economy , like the recent one of allowing some food to be sold in private markets , drove prices of produce up sharply , Song Ping , planning minister , told the National People ' s Congress last May . That could cause serious disturbances among people long used to unvarying employment and social benefits and decades of unchanging prices . The government hesitated for a decade before raising the prices of matches , for fear of the possible reaction , economist Xue Muqiao , adviser to the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy , told China Daily last June . The initial moves thus are likely to be gradual , as were those in 1978 . Those agricultural changes began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years have resulted in the near abolition of the commune system in favor of contract farming , and the freeing of over 60% of agricultural output from state control . In an unusual one-hour interview earlier this week with a group of Western businessmen , Mr. Deng reportedly said the changes called for " great courage " but also for caution . " We ' ll walk a step and watch a step , " he reportedly told the Westerners . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
