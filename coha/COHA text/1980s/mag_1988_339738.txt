George Bush 's last and greatest mission has now been defined : he is charged with taking command of the Reagan Revolution , adjusting its course a bit , and guiding it safely into the 1990s . <P> After his victory on Tuesday , which as recently as this summer seemed beyond his grasp , the man who has spent most of his career as a supporting player now has the chance to put his name on an era . The beginning of the decade that will end the century is destined to become known as the Bush years . The new President enters office with no clear mandate for imposing the tough solutions that will be necessary to tackle the nation 's festering budget crisis . Nor has he propounded a vision for fin-de-siecle America or for a world that is moving beyond the cold war . Nevertheless , he won the 1988 election with a toughness that surprised even his friends , and now he faces the opportunity and the challenge of serving as the nation 's 41st President . <P> Following Ronald Reagan would present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush is certainly not that . Although he exceeded expectations yet again with his victory this week , Bush continues to be underestimated . He did not really win , the arguments go ; he merely accepted the fruits of an inept Democratic campaign . Alternatively , it will be said that any Republican would have prevailed given the health of the economy . And then there is the argument that his artful handlers tricked the gullible voters with phony issues like crime and patriotism . Public resentment over that chicanery will soon overtake him . Congress will aggravate the hangover , making Bush pay dearly for his negative campaign . <P> These lines of reasoning have so lowered expectations for the Bush presidency that some Washington insiders are predicting the briefest honeymoon in history , a gridlock of indecision , even the inevitability of a one-term presidency . In short , President-elect Bush appears perfectly positioned to exceed expectations yet again . <P> Most Administrations enter office promising a raft of new faces and a basketful of policy initiatives . As the first sitting Vice President to be elected since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity . His campaign produced enough new ideas to fill a 347-page campaign booklet . But the proposals , with the notable exception of a few tax-cutting ideas , were created more in response to political pressures than out of personal convictions . <P> George Bush does not have a deeply held personal agenda . He has few strong ideological or intellectual beliefs at all , other than a basic decency , patriotism and desire for people to be accommodating . A stark example : Bush was torn this fall when Congress debated a federal requirement that there be a seven-day waiting period before someone could purchase a handgun , a provision supported by many law-enforcement officials . " I wish the police chiefs and the gun owners could figure out a compromise , " he lamented in an off moment . " I 'm for both sides . "
