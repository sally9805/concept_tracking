NEW YORK  --  The amount of new corporate bonds sold in the third quarter dropped to the lowest level in four years amid a slowdown in restructurings , rising corporate profits and signs that slower growth may allow interest rates to ease in coming months . In the three months ended Sept. 30 , public corporate bond issuance , excluding mortgage and asset-backed securities , plummeted to $16. 9 billion from $36. 6 billion in the previous quarter . The third-quarter volume was the smallest since $8. 6 billion in 1984 ' s second quarter , according to Salomon Brothers Inc . " There appears to be more optimism among corporate treasurers than there was several months ago that rates could move a bit lower , " said Peter Skaperdas , a Salomon vice president . " News that ( economic ) growth and inflation may be lower than expected may be prompting some treasurers to hold back on some of their long-term financing . " The recent decline in oil prices , which are often viewed as a barometer of inflation , also may have persuaded some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in expectation of lower interest rates later on , he said . But for the most part , many companies just didn ' t need to borrow as much in the third quarter . " We ' re at the point in the economic cycle when profits and cash flow are improving and are ahead of cash outlays , " said Lynn Michaelis , chief economist at Weyerhaeuser Co . , Tacoma , Wash . The third-quarter decline in bond offerings coincided with a big drop in corporate restructurings , according to Salomon . In that period , companies announced moves to retire about $13 billion of equity through mergers , acquisitions , leveraged buy-outs , stock buy-backs and self-tenders , down from $37 billion in the second quarter . Corporations usually sell debt to raise funds to retire this equity . Borrowing also appears to have slackened because companies have slowed investment in new plants this year , said Mr. Michaelis of Weyerhaeuser . For instance , commercial mortgage lending from all sources dropped to an annual rate of $40 billion in the first quarter from about $70 billion last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another reason for the slower pace of corporate debt issuance , Mr. Michaelis said , is that companies aren ' t building up inventories as rapidly as they did in the first half , which reduces their borrowing needs . Such trends typically suggest that the economy is peaking , prompting corporate treasurers to delay pending expansions . " Firms who right now are operating at or near full capacity , and who are enjoying strong profit growth , may not want to risk that position if they think there ' s going to be an economic downturn within two or three years , " said Mr. Skaperdas of Salomon . Despite the hopes for lower interest rates , however , some corporate treasurers aren ' t convinced that the recent decline in rates will continue . Because of the large U.S. trade and budget deficits and the nation ' s dependence on foreign capital to finance them , " I ' m in the group that sees quite a bit of interest rate risk in 1989 and 1990 , " said Mr. Michaelis . " That ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower and may go a lot higher , " he added . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
