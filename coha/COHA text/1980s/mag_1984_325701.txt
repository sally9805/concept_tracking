New guardians take over the Government 's bothersome booty <P> In Florida and Texas , expensive vessels seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration clutter waterways and marinas , accumulating barnacles . Along the Cape Fear River in North Carolina , a drug dealer 's former Xanadu called Castle Hayne , complete with swimming pool and 22-horse stables , sits uninhabited . In the DEA 'S Los Angeles office , a huge , garish oil painting decorates the squad room . " We do n't know where to put the thing , " an agent says of the confiscated treasure . " It wo n't fit in the vault . " <P> Since 1978 , federal agents have had the legal authority to strike at the lifeblood of organized crime and drug cartels by confiscating property or assets that can be traced to illicit profits . The program has been so successful that it has resulted in an administrative nightmare : the costly storage , maintenance , sale and disposal of the valuable but unwieldy booty . This month that bureaucratic burden was lifted from the DEA and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshals Service . <P> The traditional duties of federal marshals include apprehending fugitives , guarding dangerous prisoners and protecting witnesses in organized-crime cases . Their new job may be as challenging as any of the others . Some 49 pieces of real estate worth $8.4 million and 36 airplanes worth $7.3 million were confiscated last year by the DEA , roughly twice as much as the year before . The Justice Department last year seized more than $100 million worth of property and other assets . Among the diverse booty that must be managed and eventually sold : a jewelry store in Mississippi , a grain silo in Iowa , a floating dry-dock in Hawaii , 123 beef hindquarters in Pennsylvania and 1,700 cases of toothpaste seized in New Jersey . <P> Skeptics wonder whether the Marshals Service can cope . It certainly can not do worse than the DEA and other agencies that lacked the resources necessary to handle the goods . Congress 's General Accounting Office found that property seized during fiscal year 1981 had been so poorly maintained that cars and trucks brought only 58% of their true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are burned . ) Confiscated businesses have presented a particular problem . Consider the strange case of Rex Cauble , millionaire rancher , owner of the wildly successful Cutter Bill western-wear stores and kingpin of the " Texas Mafia , " who smuggled tons of marijuana into the Lone Star State during the late 1970s . Cauble 's corporate empire was so complex that agents felt he was the only person who could manage it efficiently . So while he was out on bail , the DEA paid Cauble $10,000 a year to run his business . They fired Cauble , however , when they discovered he was running the company into the ground . He was eventually convicted and sentenced to five years in prison . <P> The U.S. Marshals Service hopes to avoid such embarrassing quandaries by hiring experts from the private sector to oversee confiscated businesses . In addition , legislation currently in Congress would create a revolving fund to cover the costs of maintaining and disposing of seized property . Proceeds from the sale of confiscated items would be returned to the fund .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
