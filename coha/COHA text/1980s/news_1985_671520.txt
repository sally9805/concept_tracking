Coelho of California , a leading Democratic strategist , decribed the budget plan as " strictly a political document . " And while that is an extreme view , lawmakers from both parties agree that the coming battle could help determine which party will control the Senate , and even the White House , in the years ahead. // This battle was ignited by a simple economic fact . The Treasury was running out of authority to borrow money , and Congress had to raise the national debt ceiling . But this latest increase would boost the national debt past $2 trillion , a highly symbolic figure that echoed with political risk and opportunity. // The Democrats have been complaining for years that President Reagan ' s economic policies are largely responsible for the vast increase in the national debt , but they have been frustrated in their efforts to pin that blame on the President . So they planned a major propaganda offensive for this fall , when the Republican-dominated Senate would have to vote to increase the debt ceiling. // Twenty-two Republican Senators finish their terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote for the higher debt ceiling without some form of insurance policy . At that point , in stepped Senator Phil Gramm of Texas , a freshman Republican who had been waiting for just the right time to introduce his budget-balancing scheme . <> <> An Irresistible Force // When Mr. Gramm offered his plan as an amendment to the debt-ceiling increase , it quickly became an irresistible political force . Republicans not only had their insurance policy , they had a chance to demonstrate that they really did care about deficits. // In addition , Senator Bob Dole , the majority leader , has been arguing all year that Republican fortunes in 1986 would depend on his party ' s ability to control deficits and rejuvenate the economy . And he has been increasingly irritated with Mr. Reagan , whose adamant refusal to consider any tax increases has hampered Congressional efforts to cope with the deficit problem. // In private , many Republican lawmakers say the budget-balancing plan is the only way to raise new revenues , make a dent in the deficit , and keep control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan : " I see Republicans smiling - we ' re back on the offensive. " // But in order to nail down the votes of his fellow Republicans , Mr. Gramm had to make a key change in his bill . The 22 Senators who face relection did not want the plan to apply to the fiscal year 1986 , which started at the beginning of this month and will end five weeks before the elections. // So the scheme was rewritten in a such a way that it would probably not become effective until the fiscal year 1987 . As a result , any budget cuts mandated by the bill will not affect the voting public until after the ballots are counted . <> <> Thrown on the Defensive // Democrats admit that they were thrown on the defensive by the Republican counterattack . Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , the Speaker of the House , said of Mr. Gramm : " He ' s being a smart politician about it. " // Many of these Democrats say they would like to kill the budget-balancing bill outright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We don ' t have the luxury of simply stonewalling , " said Representative Vic Fazio of California. // Accordingly , the Democrats have been desperately searching for ways to regain the political high ground , and they have focused primarily on the timing of the bill . They have been arguing that since the bill is unlikely to go into effect before the election , it is a " political gimmick , " in Mr. O ' Neill ' s words , not a serious fiscal plan. // In a statement last week , Mr. O ' Neill summed up the Democratic argument this way : " The purpose of this legislation is to give 22 Senators credit for being rough and tough budget-cutters without getting their hands dirty. " // Accordingly , the top priority for the Democrats in the House-Senate conference this week will be a proposal to trigger the budget plan in the current fiscal year . In that way , they hope to refurbish their image as deficit-reducers and recapture some of the initiative they lost when Mr. Gramm made his move. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio . " We don ' t think we ' re to blame for that , and this is our chance to prove it . " <> <> Debate Over Spending Cuts // Moreover , the coming debate gives Democrats the chance to point out that it was President Reagan who promised to deliver a balanced budget in his first term in office and failed . As Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri put it , the deficit has been caused by a " failure of Presidential leadership " , not Democratic profligacy. // If the bill is amended , and the budget has to be cut before the elections , Democrats believe that will also benefit them politically . In the campaign , they say , the candidates will debate how the budget should be cut , and they believe that the voting public agrees more with them than with the Republicans. // " Should we build another MX , or spend more money for education ? " asked Mr. Coelho . " I think that sort of debate is healthy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to priorities. " // Mr. Gramm retorts that the Democratic arguments are " totally false . " Voters will know the impact of his plan before the election , he says , even if the cuts have not actually been made . Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi , the Republican whip , says the real Democratic aim is to " front load " the bill by mandating huge cuts next year and sinking the whole scheme under a wave of public protest. // " They don ' t want the process to work , " Mr. Lott maintained . " They think this is a way to kill it before before it gets out of the gate . They think they ' re bluffing us , but they may be fooled . We may take them up on it. " //
