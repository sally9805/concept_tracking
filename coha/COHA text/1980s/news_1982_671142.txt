" I thought Reagan was great in 1980 , but now I tie him to other Republican candidates and I think the Democrats have the best chance of ending the recession , " the automobile worker said . " Give Reagan credit for lowering inflation , but the cost isn ' t worth it. " // Mr. Ferencuha seems typical of many workers . Independent political authorities on politics , Democratic and Republican analysts and labor experts believe that many working-class people who voted for Mr. Reagan and other Republicans in 1980 will , given the nation ' s economic malaise and its high unemployment , switch back and vote Democratic this year. // To buttress this , the final Gallup Poll of the 1982 campaign reported yesterday the following breakdown on how manual workers intend to vote in House races on Tuesday : Democratic , 60 percent ; Republican , 33 percent ; other or undecided , 7 percent. // This was fairly close to the results in the last off-year election in 1978 , when manual workers were found to have voted 57 percent Democratic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings were comparable among labor union households , nonunion households and for sales and clerical workers , and they were also similar to findings in the 1976 Presidential election. // Thus , the new poll results were a further indication that the unusual coalition of management and blue-collar workers that helped elect Mr. Reagan in 1980 may not carry over in this year ' s balloting , as the Republicans hope. // In 1980 , large numbers of working-class Americans , for decades members of a broad coalition of workers , blacks and others who often voted Democratic , changed allegiances and voted for Mr. Reagan because of disaffection with Mr. Carter and hopes that there would be an improved economy in a Republican Administration , although , as Sam Church Jr. , president of the United Mine Workers , says , it is hard to find workers who concede having voted for Mr. Reagan. // According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll , taken on Election Day 1980 , at least 42 percent of people in union households voted for Mr. Reagan while 49 percent voted for President Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , largely reluctantly , by most American unions. // Lane Kirkland , president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations , argues that the 1980 crossover was not so substantial . Only a handful of major unions , among them the teamsters , the longshoremen , the air traffic controllers and some building trades groups , endorsed Mr. Reagan , and the federation contends , on the basis of its own studies , that 58 percent of trade union members voted for Mr. Carter . <> <> Ready to Switch Back // But no question exists that many workers voted for Mr. Reagan . Charlie Bouma , 55 , a Pittsburgh area automobile worker who says he voted for Mr. Reagan " out of desperation , " plans to vote Democratic on Tuesday . " I don ' t see how any union man can vote for a Republican , " he said. // Labor leaders were angered by Mr. Reagan ' s election and his suggestion , in February 1981 , that union leaders were out of touch with workers . In September 1981 the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kirkland , before 250 , 000 people , declared , " We are out of step with no one but the cold-hearted , the callous , the avaricious and the indifferent. " // Mr. Kirkland has designated next Tuesday as " Solidarity Day II " and said , " We are going to bring Congressmen and Senators to Washington who share our views of the Government ' s role in a modern industrial society. " // The labor movement has taken other steps to strengthen its political power . Mr. Kirkland appointed John Perkins , an aggressive political tactician , as federation political director . More money was allocated to political activities , and Mr. Perkins , turning to the use of the computer , has strengthened the federation ' s ability to speedily and more effectively communicate with workers . <> <> Unions Step Up Activities // A number of unions , the auto workers , the steelworkers , the communication workers , the bricklayers , the National Education Association , the machinists and the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , are working aggressively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Steelworkers of America , said that his union was more active politically than ever before . Andrew Palm , a district director of the union , is urging members to vote straight Democratic . The economic plight of workers is so severe that workers do not have the luxury of voting for specific candidates , he says. // Some people in the labor movement are buoyed by the success unions had in New York State in September . Then , largely through labor efforts , Lieut . Gov . Mario M. Cuomo defeated Mayor Koch for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. // Several factors would seem to favor labor-supported candidates on Tuesday : the normal increase in victories that a party out of office generally wins in off-year elections ; the economic disarray ; an unemployment rate of 10. 1 percent , highest since the Great Depression ; record levels of bankruptcies , as well as recessions in cities in the Northeast , the Middle West and industrial parts of the South and West . <> <> Message to Reagan Is Seen // Mr. McBride said , " I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Church believes that on Tuesday " working people , the aged , the poor " will send " the President a message that his trickle-down theory is not working. " // But success is not assured . Many union members are relatively well off . Many believe Mr. Reagan deserves more time to alter economic policies . Republicans historically outspend Democrats , even though , in the November election , labor political action groups are spending far more money than they have in previous elections . Unemployed people are usually regarded as less likely to vote than employed workers. // Henry Rakowski , who owns a shoe repair shop in Detroit , did not vote for Mr. Reagan in 1980 , but on Tuesday he plans to vote Republican . He said , " When times are good , people don ' t come in for shoe repairs . Now that times are bad , I ' ve got more business than I know what do to with. " // A strong Reagan opponent , Mike Bonn , president of steelworkers ' Local 2227 in the Pittsburgh area , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were depressed , generally did not participate in union affairs and thus were not swayed by labor political activities , and felt alienated from the democratic process . <> <> Hopes of Labor Experts // Still , labor experts are expecting an increased Democratic vote by working class people . In the Times/CBS News Poll in September , for example , 53 percent of respondents who identified the occupation of the principal household earner as blue-collar said they intended to vote Democratic ; 37 percent , Republican . In a post-election Times/CBS News Poll in 1980 , 48 percent favored Democrats , 44 percent Republicans. // Union experts say some union-endorsed candidates , like Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum , Democrat of Ohio , and Senator Donald W. Riegle , Democrat of Michigan , who once appeared headed toward possible defeat now appear safe , largely because of economic conditions . In the House , experts are talking of gaining at least 15 and perhaps as many as 25 seats , although larger gains once were predicted. // Jerry Clark , political director of the municipal employees union , believes that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have fallen just short of capturing the Senate , which the Republicans now control 54 to 45 with one independent , and that in the House , Democrats will gain 30 to 35 seats . <> <> ' Dragging the Country Down ' // Elbert Jarrett , a Chicago truck driver , said Mr. Reagan is " dragging the country down " and that Democrats have the best chance of attacking the recession and unemployment. // Eugene Shelton , a state employee in Illinois , said he was displeased with the President because he lost a job with the Federal Government as a result of Reagan economic policies . Mr. Shelton plans to vote Democratic on Tuesday. // Ron Funk , an electronics repairman at the United States Steel Corporation ' s Homestead Works , in Homestead , Pa. , said he voted for Mr. Reagan in 1980 because " inflation was eating a hole in my paycheck . " He said he regretted that decision. // " Reaganonomics didn ' t turn things around , " he said . " It ' s hurt too many people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday. //
