For centuries the Roman Catholic Mass , the church 's central act of worship , was celebrated by a priest reciting Latin prayers , facing the altar as the laity behind him provided a devout but silent background . In 1963 the Second Vatican Council , seeking to give the laity a greater role in the liturgy , authorized a sweeping reform of worship that included prayers in the vernacular and a rite in which the priest faced his congregation . For many conservatives , most notably the dissident French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre , the new Mass , even though it can be said in Latin , became a rallying point for defiance of the council 's reforms . <P> In a letter to bishops published last week with papal approval , the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship once again allowed limited use of the old Tridentine Mass ( after the 16th century Council of Trent , which established it ) .
