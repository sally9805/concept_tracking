Irene Chang , a junior at Berkeley , had not planned to apply for a credit card . Then she heard a rumor that students who asked for a Visa card or MasterCard at a campus Citibank booth were rejected if they were majoring in the humanities . An English major and a reporter for the college paper , the Daily Californian , Chang asked the company representative if the rumor was true . Said Chang : " She told me , ' Just put in either business administration or electrical engineering . ' " <P> After Chang broke the story of the peculiar policy last week , some enraged students proposed banning Citibank representatives and advertising from the campus . A Citibank spokesman admitted that " field of study " has been one consideration for giving out cards because it indicates how well a student will handle debt . But after complaints from campuses around the U.S. , the bank decided last year to start phasing out the policy . Now there may be hope for future artists , poets and historians .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
