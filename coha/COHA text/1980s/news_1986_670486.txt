" And I was asked to substitute for Pavarotti in the last of four Requiems by the New York Philharmonic on Dec. 16 , but I was already covering - for the tenor in ' Fledermaus ' at the Met , - and they wouldn ' t release me. " // It is in " Die Fledermaus , " in fact , that Mr. Cole will make his Met debut , as the second Eisenstein of the season in the new production of the Strauss opera . He also will step in as Rodolfo for the season ' s final " La Boheme " in the house in April and during the company ' s tour of city parks in June. // The young tenor from Kansas City , Mo. , hopes that he will be permanently on everyone ' s starting roster after the Met appearances and after the summer , when he makes his fifth visit to Austria ' s Salzburg Festival to sing under the direction of Herbert von Karajan , this time in Monteverdi ' s " Ritorno d ' Ulisse in Patria. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole ' s career since late 1982 , when the Berlin Philharmonic played in New York during a United States tour and Columbia Artists arranged auditions for 30 young singers , including Mr. Cole , who was working at the New York City Opera. // " Karajan had spent a lot of time with several singers during the process , and I was next to last , " Mr. Cole recalled . " I sang the Italian Singer ' s aria from ' Rosenkavalier ' and he asked me back the next day . After I sang it he told me to stand perfectly still as if there were a policeman behind me , and to sing it again , straight out , without moving my head or my body. // " Then he asked if I had the ' Boheme ' aria , and although I hadn ' t sung it for a year , I did it . He asked me to sing the end a second time , and to hold the high C for as long as I could . When I finished , he asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer as the understudy for the Italian Singer. // " Then , two weeks later , my manager got a Telex asking if I could fly to Vienna to record the role . The City Opera released me and I went. " // The Richard Strauss opera had never been a particular favorite , Mr. Cole said . " But two weeks at the Musikverein listening to the Vienna Philharmonic , and him conducting , and the wonderful cast - Anna Tomowa-Sintow , Agnes Baltsa , Kurt Moll , Janet Parry -I fell in love with it. " // That session began what Mr. Cole terms a " wonderful collaboration " with Karajan . There have been three other recordings - the Beethoven Ninth Symphony and Missa Solemnis and the Mozart Requiem - and concerts in Salzburg and Berlin. // " When you sing with him you feel you can do anything , " Mr. Cole said . " He not only inspires you , he pulls you into another sphere - into the stratosphere . He calls upon you to do things with your voice that you didn ' t think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Cole , who grew up in Kansas City , was 3 years old when he learned his first song , " Silent Night , " from his grandmother - who announced to the family , " I think he ' s going to be a singer . " When he was 9 , he sang in the children ' s choir at church , and a graduate student from the conservatory heard him and suggested he sing for her voice teacher. // " He took me as a student , my parents said ' Fine , ' and that was the beginning , " Mr. Cole said . " We weren ' t thinking career ; it just happened . My parents weren ' t stage parents , but my mother had sung and tap-danced as a child in a touring radio show called " Kiddie Parade , " and I had a great-aunt who had studied to be an opera singer. // " When I was little , I adored the Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald movies . I can remember my mother waking me up at 10 : 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taking me into the living room to watch them on television . I ' d sit there on the floor with my pillow and blanket , half asleep , and watch my two idols. " // The youngster sang at churches and women ' s organizations in his " high , boy-soprano voice , " and became something of a local celebrity . At 10 , he sang Amahl at his sisters ' high school , and thought , " This is it ; this is what I want to do. " // " The only doubt I ever had was when my voice changed , " Mr. Cole said . " I thought , ' What am I going to do if I have no voice ? ' Because a lot of people don ' t have a workable instrument afterward. " // He started to sing with the local opera company at 11 , and was generally " a goody-two-shoes , a teacher ' s pet . " A bachelor ' s degree at the conservatory followed high school graduation , then a year studying with Licia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Curtis Institute with Margaret Harshaw , who is still his teacher . " She taught me not just how to sing , but how to listen , " he said . " She ' s a very explicit and very technical person , and there aren ' t too many around these days. " // Mr. Cole is a lyric tenor . " At the beginning of my career , I envisioned myself singing ' Puritani ' and things like that , but nobody ever asked me , " he said . " Now the idea of ' Puritani ' really frightens me. // " I sing a big variety of lyric roles , from Mozart to Donizetti and Puccini . I haven ' t done any Bellini yet , but I ' ve been lucky enough to sing things like ' Maria Stuarda , ' ' Anna Bolena ' and ' Lucrezia Borgia , ' which a lot of singers don ' t get the chance to do . And a lot of singers who do Mozart and those roles don ' t venture into Puccini , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French repertory , and he has sung " Werther , " " The Pearl Fishers , " " Faust , " " Damnation of Faust , " and Des Grieux in " Manon " with great success in Paris , Nice , Toulouse and other cities. // " In 10 years , I ' ll probably be doing basically the same repertory , " Mr. Cole said . " I ' d like to sing for a long time , so I probably won ' t take many chances . I might extend myself a little bit , depending on what happens to the voice , maybe into a ' Ballo in Maschera . ' We ' ll see . I ' m sure that every tenor in the world dreams of singing Calaf in ' Turandot , ' but . . .

In the 1987-88 season he will do " L ' Elisir d ' Amore " at the Met . There are several orchestral concerts coming up , and he looks forward to more recitals. // Engagements in England , France , Spain , Italy , Austria , Germany , Czechoslovakia , Finland and the Netherlands have brought great confidence to Mr. Cole , and he has learned to act the tenor offstage , too .
