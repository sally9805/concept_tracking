LATE this spring , tense in their cubicles , lips moving carefully , American book-page editors and their proofreaders were learning to spell " Pleiade , " a word that kept jumping out at them from the flackery while forklifts trundled toward stockrooms the first four volumes in the-Library of America . The book I have just taken from my jacket pocket is Volume II of Oeuvres de Flaubert in the esteemed French series Bibliotheque de la Pleiade . Seven eighths of an inch thick , it weighs twelve ounces . The pages are four inches wide , six and three quarters high , and there are a surprising 1,008 of them . Anywhere I open it the book lies flat , to display forty-three lines of highly legible text on a page that does n't look crowded . Despite the extreme thinness of the sheet , what is printed on the reverse side does n't show through . The gathering ? Neatly sewn signatures , with a woven green marker attached . The binding ? Flexible plastic-coated green leatherette , gold-stamped . The paper ? I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I paid twelve Canadian dollars decades ago there was also a dust jacket , long since lost . Flaubert 's fiction consists of just six books , and Pleiade 's Volume H contains three of them complete , in texts specially established for the series by two expert editors , who have also supplied historical and biographical introductions , textual and explanatory notes , appendices , and bibliographies : everything you 'd want for serious reading . Volume I , all the rest of Flaubert 's oeuvre , is somewhere upstairs . That there was no American Pleiade seemed a scandal to the late Edmund Wilson , who as long ago as 1962 drew up a project for " bringing out in a complete and compact form the principal American classics . " He did not envisage gestures of commemoration , just simple availability for books not to be found . " The only collected edition of Melville , " he wrote , " was published in England in the Twenties and has been long out of print ; and there is not , and has never been , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " A book here , a book there , and a long silence in between , was the best America did for the authors it claimed to be proud of . " The kind of thing I should like to see , " said Wilson , " would follow the example of the Editions de la Pleiade , which have included so many of the French classics , ancient and modern , in beautifully produced and admirably printed thin-paper volumes , ranging from 800 to 1,500 pages . These volumes , published by Gallimard , have evidently been commercially successful , for they are to be seen in every bookstore in Paris . " After two foundations had said no , the National Endowment for the Humanities said yes , and then something bureaucratic happened . Somehow , as Wilson understood it , a conspiracy of boondogglers doing business as the MLA Center for the Editions of American Authors contrived to get his funding suppressed in favor of a project of their own . This was solemnly denied all round . Honest Injun , nobody at the Modern Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew was that they and platoons of honest toilers were indeed at work on diligent MLA-approved editions of Hawthorne , Melville , Howells , et al. , with results Wilson was quick to deride . The books were whimsically chosen , he charged , outrageously expensive , and bespattered with the flyspecks of a ludicrous pedantry , A page looked like " something between an undecoded Morse message and a cuneiform inscription . " He was especially funny about eighteen Twain editors reading Tom Sawyer , word for word , backward , " in order to ascertain , without being diverted from this drudgery by attention to the story or the style , how many times ' Aunt Polly ' is printed as ' aunt Polly , ' and how many times ' ssst ! ' is printed as sssst ! ' " Since the MLA had ordained that " plain texts " ? books you just read ? were to await the establishment of " critical texts " ? books that with full display of evidence sift out printer 's errors and restore lost auctorial revisions ? we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . " 1 F NOT exactly what Edmund Wilson envisaged , the Library of America has taken less time than that . " An American Pleiade , " cried The New York Times Book Review last July , examining a crystal ball thoughtfully provided by the project 's board . It seems that in 1979 the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities put up the kind of seed money Wilson had angled for , and the resulting books would be " in every way comparable to their French counterparts . " No longer would visitors from abroad have to ask of American literature , " Where is it ? And how can I take it home ? " A great wrong , said the Times , would be set right , " and one of the capstones of American civilization put firmly in place . " Now that the first four titles are available , we can examine the Pie-lade analogy . Here are three Melville novels in one volume ( Typee , Omoo , Mardi ) , and when I lay down my Pleiade Flaubert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heavy . Thirty-one ounces , says the same kitchen scale that assessed the Flaubert at twelve . A two-pound book is not a thing you hold in your hand to read . You 'll want a table . ( If your bifocals have the right prescription , a lap will do . ) Where did that weight come from ? Part of it from more pages : 1,342 as against 1,008 . But one third more pages would raise the Flaubert to a mere sixteen ounces , still a two-to-one lightness advantage . So what else ? Well , the Melville pages are bigger , four and seven eighths by seven and seven eighths , and the book is much thicker : an inch and three quarters . That means ( 1 ) there is no way it can be squeezed into a jacket pocket ; ( 2 ) Melville , to be dankly physical about his fate , has been entombed in a block of acid-free wood pulp that uses up sixty-seven cubic inches of space , as against Flaubert 's mere twenty-four . The whole of Flaubert ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic inches , total weight twenty-seven ounces . You could stick half his oeuvre in each pocket and hardly notice . But when the Melville part of the project is completed ? four volumes ? the Times 's hypothetical Frenchman who takes it home by air will find that the works of only one author leave him no space for less bulky souvenirs . He ( or anyone ) will find reading Melville physically uncomfortable for another reason . The excellent typeface has been imposed with scant regard for the " gutter , " the center valley where facing pages meet . Those center margins are so narrow for so thick a book that parts of words disappear into the gutter unless you force the thing open flat . No Library of America volume will get tossed into a knapsack . Too bricklike . If ( speaking of gutters ) rain falls onto the binding ( imported Dutch dyed rayon ) , it will stain ; raindrops on a Pleiade you merely wipe off . The paper , however , will last " for generations , " so if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rained on , you can build an estate , the " personal library " one of the brochures mentions . N American product just a little too cumbersome for normal maneuvers : that may sound familiar , and lead you to wonder if the Library of America was by any chance de-signed in Detroit . Scrutiny of the HARPER'S/AUGUST 1982 72 press kit from Gail Rentsch Public Relations , 527 Madison Avenue , leaves me unable to say . That text was laid out by Bruce Campbell , whose past credits include part of the beautiful Bollingen series ; the jackets are by Robert Scudellari with calligraphy by Gun Larson ( according to my spies , two of the most expensive people in their line of work ) . But the overall physical package ? No one is saying . Possibly a committee . If so , its collective unconscious envisaged a buyer who thinks the Pleiades rather light for the money : someone requiring a substantial object for his twenty-five dollars ( $19.95 by subscription through Time-Life Books ) , but with no immediate plans to spend hours reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the footloose in France take a Ple'iade , on an airplane trip or a backpacking weekend. * But suppose someone insists on reading . Is he offered editorial help ? Yes , some . A five-page Melville chronology , a four-page note on the texts , seven and a half pages of textual and explanatory notes ( " Sabine atrocity : The legendary rape of the Sabine women by the followers of Romulus , legendary founder of Rome " ; dig the caution of that klouble " legendary " ) . Introductions , we are told , have been omitted because they date , and these books are to stay " permanently in print " : it 's unclear , though , what need date about the introductions we get in t the Pleiade Flaubert , a compact arraying of facts about when the novels got written and what they drew on . Melville 's three Pacific romances , which came partly from identifiable source books , partly from what he saw after he jumped ship in 1842 in the Marquesas , seem to ask for just such preliminaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , " reading , " derivations from one of the projects Edmund Wilson hooted at , the MLA-NorthwesternNewberry editions of 1968-70 , and the " Note on the Texts " makes it clear that in particular was a nasty job . It entailed getting rid of second-edition changes Melville made to calm a nervous American publisher ( e.g. , " lovely houris " for " naked houris " ) while trying to save other revisions he 'd have made anyway . An editor would want to calibrate these changes with the help of the initial manuscript . But that has vanished , and for their " control " version of Typee ? the only source for restoring numerous cut passages ? the editors had to make do with a British edition that , in the course of being typeset from the lost manuscript , got infested with British spellings and usages . They persevered while Wilson grumbled , and the Library of America text of Typee is the best we 're likely to get . The other three inaugural volumes are uniform with the Melville ; just as heavy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I of four ) a Stowe ( three novels , including Uncle Tom 's Cabin ) , and ? especially notable ? a Whitman Complete Poetry and Collected Prose , which wisely uses 145 pages to reprint the 1855 Leaves of Grass , the anonymous twelve-part poem Emerson . thought " the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed . " Though Leaves of Grass subsequently became Walt 's title for his ongoing interminable callithumpian collected poetry ( here given in the final 1892 version ) , the integrity of that first sequence deserves the separate emphasis editor Justin Kaplan has accorded it . Future volumes will include James in eight volumes , Emerson in four , Twain in six , Poe in two , Henry Adams in four ... does the roll call sound familiar ? It does , despite the inclusion of Jack London ( two volumes , and billed as " the most inclusive collection available " ) . That , let us face it , is officially American Literature : something safely embalmed and ( with London as wild card ) long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend writes : " Over the past several years I 've put up a number of visitors from France . They have never failed to have a volume of the series shoved somewhere in the shoulder bag carried aboard . " 73 years , Henry James in that company seems ultramodern . Hemingway ? Faulkner ? Scott Fitzgerald ? Pound ? Olson ? William Carlos Williams ? ( And what of Tom Eliot ? Does he count as American ? He abandoned his citizenship , but so did James . ) One difference between Jack London and Hemingway is that London was a storyteller and Hemingway was a " writer , " what the French call an ecrivain . Another is that Hemingway 's copyrights were long ago sewed up by Charles Scribner 's Sons . One difference between Pound and Whitman is that a legal committee controls every syllable of Pound 's that gets into print . A proposal for a university press Ezra Pound , many volumes of texts to be straightened out and annotated , was scrapped a while back when the committee said no . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macdonald ( 1915 ? ) is that Macdonald , in devising his fables of modern identity , wrote them as things called " detective stories , " handled at Harvard with tongs , whereas Mrs. Stowe 's famous eleven-Kleenex tract , sanctified by a testimonial of Lincoln 's , soars aloft into the Disneyfied sunsets of Literature . So the matter stands in 1982 . But in a hundred years , if this series is still around , it either will have atrophied into total irrelevance or else will have managed to embalm three novels by Ross Macdonald . Just watch . And you read it here first . S 0 WHAT are our classics ? Somehow the canon first got defined in New England , and its epicenter located in Concord , Mass . ( Still , in a prospectus that runs to spring ' 84 I do n't see Thoreau mentioned , or Emily Dickinson . The only edition of Dickinson to consider is owned by Harvard 's Belknap Press , who have their own " plain text " version in print . Is that perhaps a problem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American literature , he used to argue , stemmed not from a gaggle of New England clergymen 's families and their acolytes but from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , notably their correspondence . ( Jefferson is listed for fall ' 83 : one volume . No John Adams . Henry , yes . ) But however we define its past , American Literature became an indisputable entity at about the time it entered the international mainstream , first with James and then with overlapping generations born late in Whitman 's lifetime : Pound 's own generation and its immediate juniors , **26;3625;TOOLONG and **29;3653;TOOLONG . Then Oppen-Zukofsky-Reznikoff followed , then Olson-Creeley . I 've skipped names , but one pattern is clear , It continues to the Beats , e.g. , Ginsberg , Michael McClure , Gary Snyder , who like Whitman often pretended semiliteracy as a way of outflanking the professoriat . ( For light on Beatdom , see Michael McClure 's new collection , Scratching the Beat Surface , published by North Point Press . McClure 's becoming the Beats ' elder statesman . ) The Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities of the past eighty years confronts it with special problems . One is copyrights . The Pleiade series , to revert to that one more time , includes a number of twentieth-century French writers ? Proust , Valery , Claude , Gide , Camus . But these are Gallimard authors , and Gallimard publishes Pleiade , One reason there is no Pleiade Beckett may be that his French publisher is Editions de Minuit . And if so far the Library of America 's formal announcements make no mention of anybody later than Henry James or Jack London ( who coincidentally died in the same year , 1916 ) , one reason may be that unlike Pleiade/Gallimard , it has no automatic access to any publisher 's active list . Another difficulty inheres in the word " American , " which as used on expensive books adorned with a tricolor band connotes something we all agree on without thinking , a remote whole haziness with Lincoln somewhere near the middle and Teddy Roosevelt at the outermost bound . As Jack Kennedy is said to have said of the project back when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fulfillment will do a great deal to display , both to our own people and to the world , the richness of the American literary heritage . " That does sound presidential . ( And " JFK Supported the Idea , " runs a heading in a press release . ) JFK 's key word is " display , " and once these shelf-fillers are on display , what next ? The flack sheets offer come-ons for looking inside , behind which no particular conviction is discernible . Of Mardi : " Tracing the quest for the elusive and beautiful Yillah , it remains a timely political allegory and a thrilling adventure . " Of Hawthorne : " ... astonishingly contemporary . . . the reader at the end is left in a kind of awe at the multiple possibilities of meaning . " Of racial violence in Uncle Tom 's Cabin : " some of the brooding imagination and realism that anticipates Faulkner 's rendering of the same theme . " Of Whitman : " elegiac , comic , furtive , outrageous . " Such boiler plate is stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shill Aristotle , " this wise old Greek . " We have brought you the packages , tied in red , white , and blue . They are substantial two-pound packages . We have even told you what thrills lurk within . Now let us all quietly contemplate America . The trouble with more contemporary books is that , read or not , they arouse passions . Did misgivings leap in your blood when I spoke of including Ross Macdonald ? That 's what I mean . And the howl over " Howl " ? " American ? " ; I can hear it from here . There are remarks in Uncle Tom 's Cabin fit to raise Jewish hackles ( " One would think you had taken lessons of the Jews , coming at a fellow son , but Pound in the Library of America is what would trigger letters to congressmen . By unspoken consensus , books a century old are safe . Transfer them to acid-free paper bound with the grain and Smyth-sewn , and lo , a capstone of American civilization , firmly in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
