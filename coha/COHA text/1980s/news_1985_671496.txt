The band thrives on ambiguity ; its current album , entitled either " Fables of the Reconstruction " or " Reconstruction of the Fables , " opens from the top or the left , depending which side is up . In concert , R.E.M. ' s stage lighting rarely singles out individual band members ; although the band has made video clips , it hasn ' t devoted much time to cultivating an image , defying the single-focus star-making tactics of the record business. // But for a non-star band , R.E.M. is doing quite nicely . Its concert Saturday at Radio City Music Hall is sold out ( tickets are available , however , for a show Friday at the Capitol Theater in Passaic , N.J. ) . The new album , whatever it ' s called , is currently No. 30 in the Billboard charts . " I ' d like to say we knew exactly what we were doing from the word go , " said Peter Buck , R.E.M. ' s guitarist , " but we really just wanted to do it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing I heard on the radio , and so maybe we ' d make our own record in Georgia and sell 5 , 000 or 10 , 000 copies and fill places in Atlanta. // " I like rock-and-roll a lot , but I don ' t like the glamour aspects , " Mr. Buck said . " I don ' t like the upwardly mobile rock-musician thing , where the ideal is to be wealthy and glamorous and jaded . I prefer not to have our faces splashed all over the place and be treated as pop icons . We want to be respected for what we do. " // What R.E.M. does is nothing more or less than writing and performing songs that connect Mr. Stipe ' s verbal conundrums to wiry , continually evolving guitar lines - songs that keep listeners coming back . R.E.M. ' s music evokes the folk-rock of the Byrds and the drones of the Velvet Underground , but is darker than most folk-rock and more eventful than most rock ; each song uses enough guitar riffs for half a dozen more typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Buck said . " The songs have to maintain our interest all the way through. " // While fans are listening to R.E.M. ' s spiralling guitar lines , they can also , over repeated playings , take in most of the lyrics . Although R.E.M. ' s 1984 album , " Reckoning , " had higher-profile vocals than its first full-length album , 1983 ' s " Murmur , " the new LP often keeps listeners guessing. // " Everybody says , what exactly does this mean ? " Mr. Buck said . " I know this is the age of post-literacy but really , rock-and-roll is supposed to be a feeling . To sit down and underline words and explain meanings as you would in Joyce or T. S. Eliot defeats the purpose . Lyrically , Michael isn ' t the most direct person in the world , but the songs all make sense once you know what they ' re about. " // Complex as they are , the songs reveal a recurrent theme of looking back toward simpler times . On the new album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t Get There From Here " celebrates the small-town life of Philomath , Ga . According to Mr. Buck , the new album frequently suggests " home seen from a faraway perspective. " // " There are a lot of things I like about parts of the South that are dying out , " he said . " They ' re dying out all over America . In Athens you get a real different sense of the way the world was 20 years ago . Everyone sits around their porches and talks and drinks lemonade ; it ' s kind of like Mayberry . When you go to a big city , everybody ' s got to be real modern and hip and cool . Sometimes you just want to rake the lawn . " Nigerian Performer At Sounds of Brazil There ' s likely to be an extra level of urgency in Sonny Okosun ' s performances tonight and tomorrow at Sounds of Brazil . Shortly after the Nigerian songwriter and bandleader arrived in New York Monday night , Nigeria ' s military Government was toppled in a coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll have to see what happens , " said Mr. Okosun , and joked , " If we can get back in. " // Mr. Okosun calls his style " ozzidi , " which translates literally as " There is a message . " His albums have such titles as " Which Way Nigeria ? " and , on his latest LP , " Revolution II . " But unlike the dissident Nigerian songwriter Fela Anikulapo Kuti , who is now in prison after a much-disputed currency smuggling conviction , Mr. Okosun has not directly challenged the Government . His message is a more general one , calling for pan-Africanism and liberation . " We want a leader , not a ruler , " he sings on his current album . " We want a leader , not a robber . " He has also strongly criticized South Africa ' s apartheid system ; the profits from his next single , " Fire in Soweto , " will be donated to the African National Congress , the outlawed South African rebel group. // Mr. Okosun ' s music is closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles as Ghanaian highlife , than to the juju of his fellow Nigerian , Sunny Ade . " I strongly believe that those sounds are not imported sounds , " Mr. Okosun said . " If you go to Brazil or to Cuba , there are Yorubas there ; they got their tradtion from home . We influenced them . " Americans will hear connections to soul music - although like much African music , the beat rolls along instead of stomping. // When Mr. Okosun started playing guitar , he learned Elvis Presley songs ; he had also absorbed traditional dances . His current songs , with their pan-Africanist sentiments , seek to merge an ancestral heritage with a modern message ; when he sings " Revolution , " he and his backup singers do the steps of a traditional warriors ' dance. // " Now we can not afford to sing rock-and-roll because problems are weighing on our mind , " Mr. Okosun said . " Until we are totally free we can not sing rock songs , love songs . We are not talking of making money - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village Festival A new pianist has slipped onto the jazz circuit - Geri Allen , who has just released a worthy debut album , " The Printmakers " ( Minor Music , available through Polygram Special Imports ) . Miss Allen , who was born in Detroit , has a master ' s degree in ethnomusicology . On her album , some pieces use percussive vamps and polyrhythms recalling - but not mimicking - African music ; her ballads demonstrate a rich , coloristic sense of harmony , and she can hurtle through atonal passages with steel-fingered momentum . She will perform tomorrow with the Oliver Lake Quintet in a Village Jazz Festival concert at Greenwich Music House , 27 Barrow Street. //
