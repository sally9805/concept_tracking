At Metro Park , N.J. , a station 23 miles southwest of New York City , the train stopped in its tracks for nearly an hour to allow the clock to catch up to the printed schedule. // The engineer , Robert Ulis , sat in his cab reading the Book of Revelations , and the four conductors patiently tried to explain the confusing one-night-a-year schedule change to mutinous passengers who had not realized upon boarding that they would have to relive the hour between 1 and 2 all over again in a dark , shut-down station in suburban New Jersey. // Across the country , between 1 : 45 and 2 : 30 A.M. yesterday , 45 Amtrak trains went into a state of suspended animation for about an hour to let daylight time become standard time . Every October this procedure , followed by Amtrak since it began operations in 1971 , creates a startling time warp , as trains cross both the time change and Eastern , Central , Mountain and Pacific time zones . <> <> Grumbling Passengers // " This is right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m asking ' why ' with all capitals and an exclamation point , " said Houstoun Demere , a television director from New York who suddenly discovered that a trip that was to take an hour and 53 minutes from Philadelphia to Pennsylvania Station had stretched to nearly three hours. // Al Naccarato , a seasoned assistant conductor , took such harangues calmly , dismissing disgruntled passengers as " sourballs " and " types who bark before they ' re bitten. " // " In the spring , when time moves forward , the train can ' t catch up to the clock , " Mr. Naccarato told Mr. Demere . " But in the fall , when time moves back , the train has to wait for the clock to catch up . That ' s it in a nutshell. " // Some passengers repeated the hour contentedly . Perry Fellwock , a writer for a space-commercialization newsletter in New York called Microgravity Intelligence , started reading his Science Digest magazine at 1 : 45 A.M. , and finished at 1 A.M. " Here in the middle of Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest reader in the world , " he said , smiling. // As the Night Owl pulled over in New Jersey , the Broadway Limited , from New York to Chicago , pulled over in Canton , Ohio . The Silver Meteor , from New York to Florida , stopped in Fayetteville , N.C. The Montrealer , from Washington to Montreal , stopped in Brattleboro , Vt. // Two successive California Zephyrs , traveling from Chicago to San Francisco , stopped in Elko , Nev. , and Hastings , Neb . Both the eastbound and westbound Pioneer , running between Chicago and Seattle , laid over in Pocatello , Idaho , and the eastbound and westbound Desert Wind , running between Chicago and Los Angeles , halted in Milford , Utah. // Each train waited for an hour or somewhat less , depending on whether it was operating on time as the clocks were set back. // The Southern Crescent , traveling from New York to New Orleans , stopped in Salisbury , N.C. Among its sleeping-car passengers was Ross Capon , the executive director of the National Association of Railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My wife and I were delighted to have the extra hour together , " he said yesterday. // Mr. Black , Amtrak ' s manager of corporate communications in Washington , conceded that " it ' s a rather confusing procedure unless you spend a lot of time pondering it , and not many people do. " // " The people on board might think we ' re a little crazy , " he said , " but the people on the platforms would be mighty angry if we didn ' t do it. " // He was asked why the Night Owl could not simply have stopped in New York City , since that was the destination of many of the passengers on the train , rather than making everyone wait an extra hour . " What about the people waiting on the platform in Newark ? " he said . " You can ' t simply say ' Bye , bye , Newark. ' " // Asked why Amtrak must brake for time when planes do not circle in the air for an hour , Mr. Black answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . They can adjust their departure times , and they don ' t make numerous intermediate stops like trains do . " <> <> Safety Considerations // W. Graham Claytor Jr. , the president of Amtrak , explained that the procedure was necessary to insure the safety of Amtrak ' s web of trains , as it might be not only confusing but also dangerous to have trains operating according to two different clocks. // Further , he said , the delay was necessary so that passengers who have changed over to standard time are not left stranded . For example : If a passenger who had dutifully switched his watch to Eastern standard time arrived at the Newark station to catch the Night Owl at 2 : 35 yesterday morning , and the train had continued operating on daylight time all night , it would have left New York an hour before. // " How do you notify passengers who don ' t have reservations ? " Mr. Claytor said . " A passenger who was left by a train that left the station an hour before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they ' d have good grounds. " // In the spring , Amtrak does not have to worry about leaving passengers behind when the trains are an hour late at stations on the night of the time change. // The Amtrak officials feel quite possessive about standard time , because , they say , the railroads get the credit for its adoption in the 19th century in the first place. // Before the railroads came up with a plan creating the four United States time zones and standardized time on Nov. 18 , 1883 , each city determined its own local time based upon the passage of the sun across the meridian. // A traveler from Maine to California , to have correct railroad time , had to change his watch some 20 times during the journey , according to an article published by the Association of American Railroads . In the railroad station in Buffalo , the article said , there were three clocks - one set to New York City time , by which the New York Central operated ; one set to Columbus , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads operated ; the other set to local Buffalo time. // In Kansas City , Mo. , people who wanted to know about arrivals and departures had to walk down to the edge of the hill and look down on the railway station . <> <> Passing the Extra Hour // But even now , not all railroads handle the time change in the same way . Mike Maione , a spokesman for the Long Island Rail Road , said that their trains that began runs on daylight Time yesterday finished them on daylight time , even if there were stops after 2 A.M. // " The option is to have people sit on a train for an hour , and we don ' t want to do that , " he said . The Long Island Rail Road , however , has only a few trains operating in the early morning hours for a small number of customers. // Greyhound , like Amtrak , also holds up its buses at terminals during the time change , said Cy Young , a supervisor at the Greyhound Information Center in Allentown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stations for an hour recently when the country pushed back its clocks. // On the Night Owl yesterday , people passed their lost hour in different ways . Many napped , some took a stroll along the platform outside , and some read. // Ron Serlen , an actor from Manhattan , sat doing a crossword puzzle . No. 5 across was " Like Ophelia . " " Mad , " he said , as he wrote it in ink . " Like us. " // Although conductors passed out a mimeographed sheet to passengers explaining the unexpected stop , many agreed with Mr. Serlen that this was not enough notice . <> <> ' They Got to Do It ' // Jim Fenton , who boarded in Baltimore , lost his temper when he first heard the news and told the conductor he was going to get off in Philadelphia and get a bus to New York . He had to be up early yesterday morning to conduct a test for the students he tutors in mathematics. // But after two soothing glasses of white wine , Mr. Fenton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , it ' s not the end of the world , " he said . " But they should have gave us a little more notice. " // Dennis Diamond , a television producer who boarded in Philadelphia , agreed . He said that he had called the USA Rail information number , and that no one had mentioned the hour ' s wait. // Mr. Diamond used his extra hour to write a letter of complaint to Amtrak . " Dear Person In Charge of Customer Relations , I would like to know why your company insists on treating passengers like imbeciles and cattle ? " he began . He ended with a complaint that was echoed throughout the train : Why did the company close the cafe at 1 A.M. ? // " I was just thinking that some champagne would make this more bearable , " murmured Igal Zubery , the owner of a health-food store in New York. // James Confei , who owns a body shop in Cranston , R.I. , was one of the few conscious passengers who seemed placid in his stationary state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If they got to do it , they got to do it , " he said . " It ' s part of the American way. " //
