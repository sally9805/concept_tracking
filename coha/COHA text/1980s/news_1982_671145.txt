She still wore her hospital identification bracelet , having been discharged that day , and even cinched to its tightest eyelet it had room to wobble and slide along the spastic little wrist . " He ' s coming back ! " she cried. // She could not be assured he would not . She could not be calmed . Finally the social workers left her with her night light blazing in the middle of the afternoon , a terrified testament to what has become of some of the very old down on the tip of Miami Beach . Trapped inside bodies that no longer cooperate with their minds , inside buildings politicians long ago decided to pull down , they live lives in search of mercies. // How it got to be this way has been 50 years in the making . To begin with , the south part of Miami Beach , was the first part developed , and most of the men who developed it had in mind a playground upon which blacks and Jews would not be allowed to play . It took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Depression to temper this desire . By 1947 , half the population of Miami Beach was Jewish , most of them refugees from Europe and Russia who had worked their ways to a penurious retirement through the New York garment industry . <> <> The Neighborhood of South Beach // The big money , the money that still sought exclusivity , was moving north up the seven-mile long spit of sand , with dreams of glittering hotels and a plethora of private clubs soon to be realized . Time , laws , money and enough connections would eventually break down the racial and ethnic barriers . But for the time being , left behind and left out of these plans - in contentment , by most accounts - was an area of 1. 74 square miles called South Beach , extending from 21st Street south to the end of Miami Beach . Here were 232 blocks , 103 alleys , and in 1970 the population was 42 , 000 , about 75 percent of it Jewish. // Early in the 1970 ' s , city leaders seized the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach was the area from Sixth Street south on South Beach . A building moratorium was imposed in 1973 in this quarter where about 6 , 000 people lived . In 1975 , the city got state approval to condemn 372 buildings by declaring the area blighted . In 1976 the plans called for the southern quarter of South Beach to be turned into a world-class resort , shot through with canals to rival Venice , above which would rise the finest hotels , condominiums and office buildings. // Then it was to be a $600 million project and now it is to be a $1. 2 billion project , but little has been done . Developers have backed away time and time again from the city ' s demands . The last resignation came earlier this month when The Rouse Company and First Boston Inc. refused to comply with the city ' s demand for a $100 million deposit guaranteeing the 255-acre project would be completed . The city has spent $7 million on legal and planning fees , but nothing has been constructed. // Little has been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 , either , because landlords seldom make repairs on buildings that a city intends to tear down . The City Commission is still looking for a developer . Next week , a public hearing will be held on the matter of lifting the nine-year-old building moratorium . <> <> Much Substandard Housing // The effect of the moratorium , and the redevelopment limbo , has been to hold rents to a minimum in the area intended for razing . Much of it is substandard now , though extensive surveys have determined little of it was substandard when it was declared blighted , and it is some of the cheapest housing in Dade County . When 125 , 000 Cuban refugees were allowed to come to Florida in 1980 , many chose to settle on South Beach , not only in the urban renewal area , but in the blocks immediately north , where prices have been held down by association . A result has been that most of the elderly of any means left South Beach for accomodations to the north , including cities north of Miami. // In South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 000 refugees from the 1980 Cuban boatlifts , and 13 , 000 refugees from several countries in Latin America . The population of all Miami Beach is 105 , 000 , 52 percent of the residents 65 or older . Only about 12 percent of the elderly on Miami Beach are not Jewish . To the north is the money and on the south is the poverty . The elderly population on South Beach , according to the Miami Jewish Family and Children ' s Service , is getting older , poorer and smaller . It is not being replaced. // Ruth Sale , South Beach director for Family and Children ' s Services , said that in 1980 and 1981 , when Miami ' s rising crime rate received national publicity , " a lot of children came down from the north and took their parents back home . " Those who had the money moved out of the area . Death took others . " The ones who remain are so poor , " she said , " and so frail . They don ' t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Sale went on . " Look at the places where the elderly used to bring their folding chairs . There was a time when you couldn ' t find a spot to park yourself . Now it ' s very sparse . " <> <> Crime Actually Going Down // Fear keeps the elderly inside , and it is fear that social agencies and the Miami Beach Police deal with most . Thomas Hoolahan , spokesman for the police , says the level of fear is much higher than the level of crime , and he produces statistics showing crime is down this year . Officer Hoolahan refers to the " sedate environment " that people were accustomed to here , and the change when the refugees poured in . Crimes increased , he said , but the elderly ' s " anticipation of crime went out of sight . " " To them , if we had one purse snatch , by the time they got back to their apartments we had a crime wave , " he said. // The other day , Marta Carluch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late for an appointment with an 80-year-old woman on South Beach . " Go away , " the woman said when Mrs. Carluch arrived . " Someone could have come when I thought it was you , and I could have opened the door , and I would have been knocked in the head and robbed . Go away. " // Betty Birnbach , a resident of South Beach for 42 years , was telling this story to some friends one afternoon : " My sister , she went to get on a bus . A man behind her put a knife in her back . The bus driver said , ' Lady , you ' re being robbed . ' Right at Lincoln and Washington . He got her money . She was sick . She was terrified . For three weeks she wouldn ' t go out of her apartment. " // Mrs. Birnbach works with a group of elderly and the police in a program called Senior Crime Watch . They go from building to building , giving demonstrations in personal security . They have given out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly to blow them if they are bothered or frightened on the street. // They tell women not to carry purses , because if the purse is snatched , chances are they will be hurt . They tell the elderly to try to budget so that they don ' t all have to go to the banks to cash their Social Security checks on the third day of the month , the best day for robbery on South Beach . They tell people to go places in clusters , especially at night , and consequently South Beach even at noon is all but deserted except at the bus stops , where tight knots of old people wait clutched together . On Tuesday , there were three people along 13 blocks of spectacular beach at 2 P.M. <> <> ' We Used to Go Out at Night ' // " Ah , " said Mrs. Birnbach , " we used to go out at night . The stores were all open . And when we got home we didn ' t even lock . Now you can stand on Washington Street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could drop a bomb and you wouldn ' t hurt anybody. " // " Some of the places people live in , you wouldn ' t believe , " said Steven Weisberg , director of a nutritional project for Jewish Vocational Services . The project feeds 1 , 700 elderly people a hot meal once a day five days a week , and takes box lunches to 500 who are homebound . " They live with a bed and a hot plate , and that ' s it. " // In explaining what his agency does , Mr. Weisberg said it was more than handing out food . He told of an 88-year-old woman who is in the hospital now and is expected to die . The woman started coming for meals a year ago , then started coming hours ahead of mealtime to help out as a volunteer . " She said , ' You gave me a life ' , " Mr. Weisberg recalled . " I think we gave her a year . She couldn ' t stand the weekends . She was always here hours ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " South Beach , " said a recent , special eight-page section of The Miami Herald , is a place " where dreams die . " The author of most of the section , Michael Kranish , spent three months living there , and wrote that it was " like a giant closed amusement park where the old people are suspended in fear at the top of a Ferris wheel . " <> <> Death and Redevelopment // Eventually , everyone seems to feel , the old people will die off , and eventually , there will be redevelopment . The city has asked developers to submit new proposals Dec. 6 . The long process , according to Robert Parkins , who has been city manager of Miami Beach for job six months , has been " a terrible thing , a tragic thing for these people . " " It ' s the kind of thing you look back on after nine years and say , how could that have been allowed to happen , " he said. // " It ' s all so very sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was driving a volunteer , Dorothy Ascher , to the home of the 82-year-old robbery victim who had just returned from the hospital . Down a path lined with oleander , he drove , saying : " They ought to chop down every bush in this city . That ' s where they hide , and they jump out on the old people. " // When they got to the apartment building , Mr. Stock stood out front and said : " Aw , God , I can ' t believe it . I was here four months ago when she was robbed before . We put the mesh along the windows on the side , but we ran out of money . We couldn ' t do the front . That ' s where he got in. " // Inside , the victim was shaking , and her eyes were quite wild . " And he sat on my knees , " she said . " And I was saying , ' Don ' t kill me , don ' t kill me . ' And he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he started putting it in my mouth . He broke my jaw. " // Mrs. Ascher hugged the woman to stop the trembling , hugged her tighter and tighter , but couldn ' t stop it . After awhile she and Mr. Stock left , and the old woman put the dead bolt across the door . Then she went to the window and stood a shaky guard there for a very long time. //
