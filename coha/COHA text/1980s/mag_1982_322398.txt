U.S. Jews start cautiously to question Israeli policy <P> " For a while , American Jews became not a chosen people but a frozen people , unable to talk or dissent . I am glad we are getting thawed out . " <P> So says Albert Vorspan , vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations , but his is not a popular view . Most American Jews are apprehensive , if not heartsick , about the anguished debate that has broken out inside their community on the actions of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin 's government . The war in Lebanon , and Begin 's brusque rejection of President Reagan 's peace plan for the Middle East , have shattered a tradition that was already fraying : namely , that in times of crisis American Jews should repress any qualms they might have about the policies of an Israeli government . More Jewish Americans are questioning those policies , and more publicly , than ever before . <P> The debate echoes far beyond the extended , and far from monolithic , family of 6 million American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policymakers in Washington , and possibly on those in Jerusalem . The debate means that Begin , who has always been a more controversial figure to American Jews than his predecessors as Prime Minister , can no longer count on the united and vigorous pressure of U.S. Jews to bend the Administration away from any measures that Begin strongly opposes . <P> Even leaders of the national Jewish organizations that make up one of Washington 's most effective lobbies are having difficulty coordinating their response to Reagan 's peace plan . The international service organization B'nai B'rith last week praised one feature to which Begin most strongly objects . The Prime Minister had protested that Reagan 's call for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip " in association with Jordan " might open the way to a Soviet-dominated state ruled by the hated Palestine Liberation Organization . B'nai B'rith acclaimed Reagan 's plan specifically " because it asks Jordan to take responsibility for negotiating directly with Israel on the future of the West Bank and Gaza . " Albert Spiegel , an unofficial adviser to Reagan on Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the pronouncement was discussed . He can not recall any other statement by a major Jewish organization so strikingly at variance with the declared policy of an Israeli government . <P> <P> Howard Squadron , president of the American Jewish Congress , sharply criticized Reagan 's proposals but nonetheless said they could become " an important contribution to the advancement of peace in this area , " and Thomas Dine , executive director of the 30,000-member American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the official lobby for American pro-Israeli groups , initially declared that he saw " a lot of value " in them . But after the Arab League at its summit meeting in Fez , Morocco , continued to insist on an independent Palestinian state , the A.I.P.A.C. issued a formal statement charging that Reagan 's plan had fallen victim to " the classic pattern of Arab duplicity and American naivet . " The A.I.P.A.C. has nevertheless asserted that " there were positive points in the President 's initiative . "                   @ @
