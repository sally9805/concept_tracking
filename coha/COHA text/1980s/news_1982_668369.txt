CHURCHILL , CANADA - It ' s midnight but it ' s light outside . It ' s spring but there are icebergs behind the house . The plants are ankle- high , seals swim in the back yard , windblown trees have branches on one side only , and the telephone poles are slanted . Is this happening ? It is in Churchill , Manitoba , a remote town on the bleak and rocky western coast of the Hudson Bay which , a tourist brochure guarantees , " is unlike any place you have ever seen . " It probably is , if you ' ve been spending your time down south . " Down south , " in Churchillian lexicon , is almost all of inhabited North America . The town ( population 1400 human beings and approximately 300 polar bears ) is roughly 1200 miles farther north than Boston and may well be the coldest and most isolated in the province . Winter temperatures can plummet to minus 45 . The residents , hardy and energetic , are inured to the long , cold winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explore Manitoba ' s Sub- Arctic , " says the welcome sign at Churchill ' s airport , " And Freeze Your Nose . " No roads lead to Churchill . You can fly in , or you can take the train . Churchill , at the mouth of the Churchill River , is the end of the railroad line - all 900 interminable miles of it from Winnipeg , the provincial capital down south . They say it took 18 years to lay the last 500 miles of this railroad over the spongy , soggy muskeg of Manitoba ' s northland - so soft that the telephone poles are set on an angle so they won ' t sink . Difficult as it was , the railroad had to push north . Churchill is Canada ' s only northern grain port . Today shipping - grain to Russia and Europe , and supplies to the Northwest Territories - is the major industry , Churchill ' s raison d ' etre . The other industry is tourism . Honest . Business was slow at first ; people in Churchill still remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Mr. J.B. Hooper of San Francisco , whose visit , in itself apparently an historic event , is chronicled in the town ' s new history book . Last year 14,000 tourists trekked to Churchill , claims Jack O ' Connor , president of the Chamber of Commerce , and they ' ve come from as far away as Japan and Australia . They come to fish or to see the seals and beluga whales that move in and out of Churchill Harbour.cq . They come to see caribou on the tundra and the tiny arctic and sub-arctic plants that grow perfectly , although dwarfed , because of the short growing season and the permafrost underneath the ground . They come to watch birds - more than 125 species of them - including the rare Ross ' Gull of Siberia , a birder ' s bonanza . They come to see the polar bears . By some odd quirk of fate , Churchill sits along the polar bear ' s migration route . As many as 300 bears may lumber through the Churchill area in the fall , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hunt seals at the ice floe edge . They often congregate , sometimes a dozen at a time , around the town dump to scavenge for food or on the rocks and shore . The Polar Bear Capital of the World , that ' s what the folks in Churchill call their home . What do you do when 300 250-400 pound polar bears - beasts that can eliminate a seal in one swat - come to town ? People in Churchill shrug . Long-time residents ( " lifers , " they call themselves ) are blase about the bears , having cohabited with them for years . Ambulance , Polar Bear Alert , Fire , Hospital , Police is how the town ' s emergency numbers are listed - nothing dramatic , no fanfare . For them , the bears of Churchill are as commonplace as cockroaches are to Cantabridgians . " So commonplace you don ' t even think about it " said John Ingebrigtson , 61 , a Churchill businessman who has lived in the town for 50 years . Not that the bears haven ' t made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up on doorsteps and Paul Ratson , 26 , once had his car window smashed by an inquisitive bear who left its noseprint on the glass . " But I don ' t consider the bears a problem , " says Ratson , whose wife Melanie does : " I ' m terrified of polar bears , " she said . " I ' ve seen what they can do . One swipe and you ' re dead . " Paul has seen them in action , too , but like many people in Churchill , he ' s unruffled . " There are people who think we ' re under seige . But other people live with other problems . . . You just tend to be careful , that ' s all . " Being careful means carrying a gun during bear season ( October and November ) when you ' re out on the tundra , just in case a bear goes after you ; it ' s not likely to happen , they say , unless a bear is provoked . For young children , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about - just in case - and learning what to do if they meet one . ( Drop to the knees , go into a fetal position , and play dead . ) For the rest of the town it means contacting Churchill conservation officer Ken John immediately if they spot a bear in town . Fortunately , serious emergencies are rare . The last polar bear- inflicted death took place in 1967 when an Inuit ( Eskimo ) youth decided to stalk bear tracks into a bush and the bear woke up . Only about two bears a year end up as victims , said officer John . They ' re usually shot by a game warden if a bear gets too close to town - inside a house , for instance . Said officer John : " I tell everybody , treat the bears with respect . . . but we can ' t afford to gamble with people ' s lives for the sake of the bears . " What else do you do when bears come to town ? In the spirit of free enterprise you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea North Tours , even offers a money-back polar bear guarantee , effective on days when he knows where to find them . During bear season , that ' s easy . " It depends on whether you want to look for a garbage bear or a wild one on the tundra , " said naturalist Al Chartier . And in the spirit of the north , you also tell bear stories . John Ingebrigtson ' s favorite is the one about the time , more than 40 years ago , his mother found a bear poking around the ice box in the pantry of the house . After she got the door open " She whacked the polar bear on the bum and lived to tell the tale , " he recalled , still proud . Ratson likes his story about the time he went hunting , tripped over a gravel pile , and fell in front of a bear who was on the other side . Ratson played dead . It worked . The bear walked away . " Let ' s just say it had really bad breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Churchill have learned to look after themselves , to handle their own emergencies in their own way . People who can cope with polar bears in the neighborhood , after all , must be able to cope with almost anything . Like the grain problem . Churchill ' s Chamber of Commerce is worried about a report that the Canadian Wheat Board may ship less grain through Churchill to Russia . So last month the Chamber took matters in its own hands and telegrammed - who else ? - Soviet chief Leonid Brezhnev . The message , addressed to " Mr. Premier , Kremlin Building , Moscow " urged him to " do everything you can " to help get more grain shipped through Churchill . Why waste time with the " official people " in Canada , Chamber president Jack O ' Connor figures . " You ' ll just get the run- around from all the bureaucrats . If the cat can ' t talk to the king . . . " The cost of living is a problem they can ' t escape . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tour company , pay $450 a month to heat their small house , a three bedroom bungalow with cracks in the newly painted walls because the permafrost below is always shifting , always moving the house . The cost of food and just about everything else is high , too , because of shipping expenses . A half-gallon of milk is $2.32 and a loaf of bread is more than a dollar , said Bonnie . " Actually I ' m not sure exactly what it is . You learn not to look at prices . " You also learn patience , indulgence . Selection is limited in Churchill ' s two grocery stores , one clothing store , and no furniture stores . You don ' t buy things , you order them . " We have catalogues coming out of our ears , " said Bonnie . Car parts take a few weeks to arrive from down south . " That ' s why everyone has one or two cars , " Al said . " We have spares of everything , I guess . " You learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thriving boom town ; it ' s a former US and Canadian military base and the population in the ' 60s , composed largely of military people and civil servants , soared to 6500 . But the army pulled out . " Manitoba ' s incredibleshrinking town , " Churchill ' s been called . In the 1970s , the federal and provincial governments poured $40 million into the town for a massive redevelopment project with new housing , a new hospital , a new high school and new offices . They built a mammoth $13 million town complex to accomodate 5000 people . It holds a curling rink , swimming pool , bowling alley , movie theater , games area and skating rink . Thirty thousand dollars worth of magnificent Eskimo wall hangings are suspended from the ceilings . " We assumed there was something coming , " said Pat Penwarden , who owns Churchill ' s Tundra Inn hotel . But nothing did . A population influx of civil servants was short lived . " Who didn ' t leave except the welfare office ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial and federal policies had been over extended . There are still mounds of rubble where some of the old structures stood , and the town complex - known as the town ' s white elephant - is often practically empty . There is nobody in Churchill to run the movie theater , but on the other hand " kids get to have the skating rink to themselves , " said Bob Penwarden . " A dozen people in the pool is a lot . " The town complex cafeteria features " white elephant burgers " on the menu . When you live in Churchill , you learn to develop a sense of humor . You also learn to make your own entertainment . There are no movies in Churchill , no newspaper , no orchestra , not even a music teacher . ( There ' s no dry cleaner , either , or barber , for that matter . People have learned to cut each other ' s hair , Al Chartier said . ) But there are three television stations , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive three days late . 4John Ingebrigtson , a warm , erudite man who collects rare books , subscribes to a lot of magazines . Brian Ladoon , 29 , hitches up a dog team and mushes up north , to what they call the real north , the Northwest Territories . To " Eskimoland , " said Ingebrigtson . Other residents enjoy a Longest Day party and snowball fight on the edge of the Bay on June 21 , the summer solstice . And once in awhile Churchillians " get out " and go to Winnipeg , as Conservation Officer Ken John does when the craving for a Big Mac gets too bad . But most of the people can hardly wait to come home . Things move too fast down south " in that inevitable rat race , " said Ingebrigtson , " where people are running around and not knowing where they ' re going . " Churchill offers them something that no city , with all its cultural advantages , can . " The freedom , " said Ingebrigtson , " to go to hell in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town is stark and , frankly , ugly , with its dull dark buildings and constantly peeling paint . " The town itself is a shock to the newcomer , " the town history book admits . " It appears gray . " But Churchill has its own beauty , people there insist . Being able , for instance , to see the aurora borealis - the northern lights - from your backyard and seeing the first whales and seals and bears of the season . Not having to worry about locking your doors and being able to leave your keys in the car . Ignoring the metric system because everybody in town agrees it ' s silly to change . And meeting people from every continent on the globe who want to see your bears .
