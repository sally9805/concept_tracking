 | I was sure something was seriously wrong with me , but my doctors kept telling me it was " all in my head : ' In the end , it was my husband who discovered the truth ? and saved my life By Michelle Palatucci as told to Lisa W. Strick T hree years ago my world could n't have been rosier . I was twenty-four years old , engaged to a wonderful man , and had a job I loved in hospital administration . And recently I 'd just moved into my very own house ? a one-bedroom cottage in a New Jersey resort community , only a few blocks from the beach . Though the house needed quite a bit of fixing up , it had a big yard for my dogs . My fiance , John , a mechanic , was helping me with the renovations , and we planned to live there after we were married . Then one morning , several months after I 'd moved into my new home , I woke up feeling that something was seriously wrong with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly get out of bed , and the fatigue persisted throughout the day . Over the next few days the tiredness did n't go away ? in fact it got worse . My arms and legs were so weak they felt like rubber . When I walked down the hospital corridors , I often found myself gripping the handrails that were there for the patients to hold for support . I could n't imagine what the problem was since I 'd always been exceptionally healthy , and I 'm usually a bundle of energy , going skiing , bicycle riding , playing softball , and taking moderndance classes a few nights a week . This dragged-out , tired feeling just was n't like me . What was even more puzzling was the way the symptoms would come and go . Sometimes I 'd feel weak and tired all day . Other days , I 'd feel all right in the morning , then fatigue , combined with pounding headaches , dizzy spells , and heart palpitations , would hit late in the afternoon . Occasionally I 'd feel almost like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther between . And whatever was wrong with me , I could n't seem to shake it . When John and I married in May 1984 , I was a different woman than the one he 'd met at a family picnic 10 months before ! John was so concerned about my health that he insisted I see a doctor . At this point , I was concerned too ? so I made an appointment with a physician at the hospital where I worked . He diagnosed me as having hypoglycemia ? loss blood sugar ? and put me on a special , high-protein diet . Although I stuck to the diet faithfully , I continued to feel so tired that John was finding it increasingly difficult to get me up in the mornings . Sometimes it took 30 minutes of poking and prodding to get me out of bed . When I told my doctor that my condition had not improved , he referred me to an endocrinologist for further testing . And when the test results came back negative . the specialist said I probably was  | suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was n't the first time it had been intimated that my illness was " all in my head . " When I was preparing for my wedding , several friends attributed m headaches and fatigue to " nerves . " But I did n't believe that stress was the cause of my problems . I was in lo . e with John and thrilled to be marrying him , I liked my job , and my relationship with my family was close and warm . In short there was nothing in my life that could cause psychological problems . To make matters even worse , I v. s afraid that whatever I had was comagious . Now John was complaining of occasional fatigue and headache , . too ? though his were nowhere as severe as mine . By this time he was doing most of the house renovations himself . because I simply did n't have the energy to help him . My family physician suggested that I see a neurologist to rule out myasthenia gravis . I 'd never heard of that illness . and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified to learn that it was an incurable , fatal disease with symptoms exactly like my own ! By now , John and I were thoroughly frightened . Over the next month I saw several specialists and had endle. tests . After weeks of anxious waiting . we were relieved beyond words to learn that they were all negative . Since the doctors found nothing conclusive , the , all decided that there was nothing really wrong with me , that I had emotional problems . Some were kind and polite about it , some were blunt , but I could tell they 'd written me off as a hypochondriac . But I knew I was n't imagining my illness . By this time I was having " spells ' of headaches , dizziness , nausea , and fatigue almost constantly . Fortunately , I had two months of sick leave accumulated , and my family physician suggested that I use it . So I took the summer of 1984 off . I rested at home during July and August , hoping my health would improve . But if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Sometimes I 'd force myself to try to do some simple task , like clean out a closet . But I rarely had the stamina to finish the job . By then John was doing most of the shopping , cooking . and housework , so it did n't strike either of us as odd that he too was more tired than usual much of the time . When I returned to my job in September , I was surprised to find that getting  | back to work actually made me feel a little better . But by bedtime I was usually exhausted again . Even more upsetting was my emotional state : My outlook on life had become so negative that I did n't look forward to anything . Though John and I had planned on someday having children , that now seemed out of the question . Even if I could withstand a pregnancy , I certainly did n't have the energy to care for a child . Just when I thought things could n't possibly get any worse , they did . Within weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered neck and back injuries . Then John had an accident with a table saw and severed three fingers . Fortunately , surgeons were able to reattach them , but it was some time before we were certain he would regain full use of his hand . As a result of my accident , I became terrified at the thought of driving . In fact I no longer wanted to drive at all . I finally decided to see a psychologist . Talking to him about my fears helped so much that eventually , I was able to regain my confidence behind the wheel . That started me thinking that perhaps I should talk to the psychologist about my other , more serious health problems . If my illness really was " all in my head , " perhaps he would be able to help me overcome this problem , too . It was fortunate that I decided to confide in him ? because I had an " attack " right in his office . At the next session , he told me that my eyes had glazed over , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what you 've got , " he said , " but it 's a physical problem . " He urged me to see a cardiologist immediately , and as disillusioned as I was with doctors , I agreed to go . Though the cardiologist was more sympathetic than any of the doctors I 'd seen , I was n't surprised when he could n't diagnose my problem . Neither could the allergist I went to as a last resort . I now felt as though I had nowhere else to turn . I had pretty much given up hope that anyone would be able to find out what was wrong with me when John made the discovery that not only cured me , but probably saved my life . He 'd just finished painting the exterior of our house when he noticed that one area of siding had already turned black and was covered with soot . Puzzled , he took a closer look .  | " There 's a vent up there that traces back to the hotwater heater , " he told me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The heater is gas-operated , and gas is supposed to burn clean . We 'd better call the gas company right away . " A representative from the gas company arrived within minutes . He checked the water heater , then told us that it was improperly vented . " This is a dangerous situation , " he said gravely . " When a heater is vented through the wall as it is here , rather than the roof , carbon monoxide can build up under the eaves and back-draft into the house . Carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas . Has anybody here been sick ? " John and I looked at each other , thinking the same thing : Could this be the cause of my illness ? I immediately looked up carbon-monoxide poisoning in my medical dictionary . It listed the symptoms as headaches , pounding of the heart , dizziness , weakness ( especially in the extremities ) , faintness , and nausea ? everything I 'd complained of all those months ! Suddenly , all the pieces fit together . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , for example ? and that I 'd gotten sicker when I stayed home from work . Even the come-and-go nature of my illness began to make sense . A water heater burns intermittently , and weather conditions could affect how much deadly gas leaked back into the house . And since the fumes were odorless , we had n't been able to detect them . It now seemed likely that John had been a victim of carbon-monoxide poisoning too . Working on the house , he 'd spent much more time outdoors than I had , which probably explained why his symptoms were n't as severe as mine . I could n't believe the irony of it all ? the house we 'd been working so hard to fix up had actually been poisoning us ! The gas-company representative turned the water heater off and ex- plained that it would have to be repaired and reinspected before we could turn it on again . John made the repairs himself , and the inspector passed his work with flying colors . Meanwhile , I contacted the cardiologist who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though he warned me that it would take some time to get the carbon monoxide completely out of my system , I found that within two weeks I was feeling much better . And two months after that , I was my " old self " again enjoying bike rides , dance classes , and long walks on the beach with John and the dogs . I 'm still angry at the doctors who told me that whatever I had was n't lifethreatening . I 've since learned that faulty or improperly vented furnaces , stoves , and heaters cause hundreds of deaths each year . John and I feel that were 're lucky to be alive . Today my life is not only back to normal , it is better than ever . I recently got a new job in the technical-publications department of a large company and my boss thinks I 'm so efficient that she 's been giving me more and more responsibility . And John and I decided we wanted more space ? so we 've just bought a beautiful three-bedroom house . You can be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully before we move in !
