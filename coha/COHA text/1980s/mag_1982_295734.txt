LESOTHO Predawn Raid South Africa 's blanket invasion <P> At 1 o'clock in the morning a full moon shone over Maseru ( pop . 75,000 ) , capital of the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho , a mountainous enclave within South Africa . Most of the residents had gone to bed , except for a few night owls playing the slot machines and roulette wheels of Maseru 's two casinos . Suddenly the staccato of gunfire rocked the night . Lesotho had been invaded . <P> During the next hour , 100 South African commandos who had crept across the border only a few hundred yards away fanned out along the streets , seeking out targets . Meeting no opposition from Lesotho 's tiny 2,000-man paramilitary force , they blasted their way through at least a dozen homes . By morning the body count was 42 ; of the dead , 30 were believed to be members of the African National Congress ( A.N.C. ) , a black nationalist organization dedicated to overthrowing the white minority government of South Africa . The remaining victims were Lesotho residents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the South African troops returned home . <P> In a dawn announcement in Pretoria , General Constand Viljoen , chief of the South African Defense Force , explained that the raid , unofficially named " Operation Blanket , " had been a pre-emptive strike against A.N.C . militants who had come to Lesotho over the past few months . According to Viljoen , the A.N.C . members were planning attacks in South Africa against political leaders in the black " homelands " of Transkei and Ciskei . South African defense officials displayed a rocket launcher , rifles and some grenades of Communist-bloc origin that they said had been captured in the raid . <P> An A.N.C . spokesman in Zimbabwe denied the South African charges and denounced the invasion as a " coldblooded massacre . " Charging that the A.N.C . members killed were political refugees , not terrorists , Lesotho 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , Charles D. Molapo , labeled the attack " murder " and asked for an urgent meeting of the U.N . Security Council . Given the landlocked country 's economic dependence on South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a break in relations with Pretoria . <P> Joining the chorus of international protest , the Reagan Administration deplored the attack and called for a settlement in southern Africa " through peaceful negotiation . " That goal seems out of reach : South Africa clearly intended its show of force to be a message to other southern African states harboring A.N.C . militants , like Zimbabwe and Mozambique , that it is prepared to strike again if necessary .
