By most measures , North Carolina Congressman James Broyhill is a true-blue Republican conservative . After 23 years on Capitol Hill , Broyhill , 58 , has an 88% approval rating from the American Conservative Union , and the Congressional Quarterly reports that he took the conservative side in more than 85% of House votes in the past decade . But as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in a hotly contested primary next week , Broyhill is finding that his grades as a conservative simply may not be good enough . <P> Broyhill 's opponent is Right-Winger David Funderburk , 42 , a former Reagan Administration Ambassador to Rumania who resigned last year , charging that the State Department was too soft on the Communist country . Funderburk 's campaign is being run by the state 's National Congressional Club , which previously engineered the elections of Conservative Avatar Jesse Helms and his colleague John East , who is leaving the Senate after just one term because of a thyroid disorder . The N.C.C . has launched the same no-holds-barred polemical attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials have lambasted the Congressman as a Washington insider not to be trusted , a turncoat conservative who voted for " Tip O'Neill 's budget , " the surrender of the Panama Canal and a national holiday commemorating Martin Luther King 's birthday . The most damaging blow , however , may be Funderburk 's recent contention that Broyhill wants to set up two nuclear-waste sites in the state . Actually , Broyhill introduced legislation to establish a waste site in the West ; the bill was later amended in the Senate to set up a second site , not necessarily in North Carolina . <P> Although the N.C.C . ' s tactics worked in 1984 to re-elect Helms in a close victory over then North Carolina Governor James Hunt , this time they may backfire . Broyhill has long represented the state 's traditional Republicans , while Funderburk has never run for public office . The Congressman has tried to remain above the fray , refusing even to debate his opponent . Broyhill is still the front runner , but with only 20% of North Carolina 's nearly 800,000 Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be close . The true winner could be the Democrats , who hope that after the G.O.P. 's spring mudslinging , the survivor from among the ten Democratic hopefuls can mop up in the fall election .
