The latest talks between the two sides lasted five hours yesterday in Princeton , N.J. But progress was described as meager , and both the league and the National Association of Basketball Referees , representing the 29 regular officials , said there would not be enough time to get them to the opening games tonight no matter what happened at negotiations scheduled for 2 P.M. today . <> <> Knicks Waive Sherod // Yesterday ' s talks were held as some of the league ' s 23 teams engaged in transactions to meet last night ' s deadline for achieving a 12- man roster limit . The Knicks , who open tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Richfield , Ohio , reduced to the limit by waiving the guard Ed Sherod and placing their third center , Eric Fernsten , on the injured-reserve list . The Nets , who open at home tonight against Atlanta and who had been below the limit , added a 12th man by signing the veteran guard Foots Walker , as expected. // Among other moves around the league , the biggest news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-old veteran guard of 13 seasons , announced his retirement , effective immediately. // <> <> League Changes Rejected // After the meeting yesterday between the league and the referees , the N.B.A. said it had put an additional proposal on the table that would have increased the starting salaries to $28 , 000 , from the league ' s original offer of $24 , 000. // Richie Phillips , the union ' s general counsel , acknowledged the offer but said : " It was unacceptable because it was the same for all three years of the contract . They wouldn ' t budge on the second and third years. " // Phillips also said that the union had reduced its salary demands for each of the three years in a new contract . It is now asking $32 , 000 for starting referees , he said , instead of $35 , 000 in the first year , $35 , 000 instead of $37 , 000 in the second year , and $38 , 800 instead of $39 , 000 in the final year. // Phillips said the referees would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullets at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the Knicks ' home opener tomorrow night against the Washington Bullets at Madison Square Garden . The referees will be joined , he said , by members of the Major League Umpires Association , another union for which Phillips is general counsel. // // Walker ' s 2-Year Pact // The Nets ' new contract with Walker , which had been expected for more than a week , is for two years , with his salary fully guaranteed . A source close to the negotiations said Walker would receive more than $100 , 000 a year . Darwin Cook will start at point guard alongside Otis Birdsong in tonight ' s opener against the Atlanta Hawks at Byrne Meadowlands Arena . Cook is filling in for Kelvin Ransey , who is in Toledo , Ohio , where his father died Wednesday night. // Up front , things will look much the same as last season , with Buck Williams and Albert King at forward and Darryl Dawkins at center. // Meanwhile , there was another roster-related development late yesterday . In a ruling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season , the league decided that if the Nets kept each of their 12 players , they would lose the $175 , 000 credit that they were allowed when they waived Michael Ray Richardson , contending that he had suffered a relapse of cocaine abuse . The $175 , 000 sum is 50 percent of the salary that Richardson ' s contract calls for this season. // In the wake of the league ' s ruling , the Nets allowed the deadline to pass late in the afternoon without waiving a man , a move that would have allowed them to keep the credit. // But it appeared that this would not end the haggling . The National Basketball Players Association said it was challenging the league ' s ruling in this case and had asked for a review of the matter before Telford Taylor , the special master , who settles disputes between the league and its players . No date for that review has been scheduled. // // Knicks Have 6 Guards // With yesterday ' s waiving of Sherod , the Knicks still have six guards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry . But one of those six is Rudy Macklin , who , at 6 feet 7 inches , has also been used as a small forward. // Fernsten , whose ailment was described as " Achilles ' tendinitis of the left foot , " signed a guaranteed one- year contract with the Knicks as a free agent last month . He must miss at least five games. // The Knicks will open tonight with Bill Cartwright at center , Truck Robinson and Bernard King at forward , and Ray Williams and Rory Sparrow at guard. // // Murphy Moves Aside // Murphy announced his retirement in Houston , saying that his departure was a reluctant one but that he wanted to make room for younger players. // " I hate to miss the chance to play with Ralph Sampson , " Murphy said of the Rockets ' celebrated rookie . " In 13 years , I ' ve played with and against all the great players , like Wilt Chamberlain , Jerry West and Hal Greer and all the others. " // He played in college at Niagara University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000-a-year contract with the Rockets. // // Hubie Brown on Nets // In an article in this week ' s Sports Illustrated Hubie Brown says that he was prepared to succeed Larry Brown as the Nets ' coach . Larry Brown quit last April with six games left in the regular season. // " The truth is , I was ready to go , " Hubie Brown is quoted as saying , " but the Knicks wouldn ' t give me permission. " // However , last April , when asked by CBS-TV to comment on the reports , Hubie Brown said , " First of all , I did not ask permission to talk to the Nets , and the Nets have not asked to talk to me. " // Brown also criticizes players , coaches , general managers and television commentators in the article. // He says of Bill Russell , the former CBS basketball commentator : " That moron has done more to cause the game ' s popularity to regress than anyone or anything else . He doesn ' t know anything about the game , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current Nets ' coach , Hubie Brown says : " Stan Albeck is a washerwoman who calls six people every day to find out the latest gossip. " // Efforts to reach Hubie Brown were not successful . But John Hewig , publicity director of the Knicks , said last night that Brown would not comment on the magazine article. // //
