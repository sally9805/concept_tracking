Some loose talk triggers an avalanche of anxiety and accusation <P> The mood was easy , the conversation relaxed , as Ronald Reagan lunched at the White House with a small group of out-of-town newspaper editors . Was it possible , wondered one of the visitors , to have a limited exchange of nuclear weapons without setting off a nuclear war ? <P> The President casually replied , " I do n't honestly know . " He went on to say that as long as you have " that kind of a stalemate " in which " the only defense is , well , you shoot yours and we 'll shoot ours , " then " I could see where you could have the exchange of tactical weapons against troops in the field without its bringing either one of the major powers to pushing the button . " <P> The President then added : " I do have to point out that everything that has been said and everything in their manuals indicates that unlike us , the Soviet Union believes that a nuclear war is possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 48 hours after the President made these remarks , nobody paid much attention . In the first place , they were embargoed for two days in order to give the visiting editors a chance to write their stories . But besides that , the reporters who regularly cover the President were used to hearing him muse vaguely about policy matters , and , more to the point , his remarks represented no change in U.S. military policy . However carelessly he may have spoken , Reagan was simply restating a tenet of the doctrine of " flexible response " that both the U.S. and its European allies accepted years ago : the use of tactical nuclear weapons would not necessarily lead to nuclear holocaust . If the Soviets were to attack in Europe with their overwhelming superiority in conventional arms , NATO could choose to respond on the battlefield with tactical nuclear weapons , a threat meant to deter any invasion in the first place . <P> But all last week , as the President 's words were reported , misreported and exaggerated , they detonated on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan 's remarks to try to show that the U.S. was willing to use weapons that would inevitably bring on the holocaust . Said Brezhnev : <P> <P> " Only he who has decided to commit suicide can start a nuclear war in the hope of emerging a victor from it . No matter what might the attacker possesses , no matter what method of unleashing nuclear war he chooses , he will not attain his aims . Retribution will ensue ineluctably . " <P> The next day , TASS , the official Soviet news agency , used Reagan 's remarks to exploit the swelling movement of neutralism and pacifism in Europe that is suspicious of U.S. intentions . Declared TASS : " The U.S. would like Western Europe to face all the risks of a thermonuclear catastrophe while the U.S. keeps away from it . "
