Iran and Iraq suffer heavy losses as fears rise of a major escalation <P> " From today , the siege of Kharg Island will begin . " <P> That chilling announcement by the Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein last week sent shock waves of alarm to the U.S. , Western Europe and Japan , as well as to Iraq 's Arab neighbors . It suggested that after 41 months of bloody but inconclusive fighting between Iraq and Iran , the Iraqis had decided to make good on a longstanding threat to close down Iran 's biggest oil-exporting terminal . If that happens , the Iranian government of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini has threatened to retaliate by blockading the 40-to-60-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz , through which 20% of the non-Communist world 's crude oil passes . Such a closure , in turn , could widen the war considerably . President Reagan declared only two weeks ago , " There is no way we could stand by and see that sea-lane denied to shipping . " <P> The Iraqi announcement briefly sent up the prices of spot oil and metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Iran declared that no attack had taken place , and U.S. reconnaissance photographs appeared to back up the denial . In a startling communiqu at week 's end , the Iraqi military command admitted that it had not struck Kharg Island after all . But , it said , it had hit tankers and other ships in the area . Most diplomats concluded that Saddam Hussein had announced the phantom attack in a desperate warning to the West that Iran must not be allowed to defeat Iraq . <P> Saddam Hussein has every reason to be worried . Five years after the revolution that toppled the Shah Ayatullah Khomeini 's theocratic regime has consolidated its power at home , settled most of its international debts and demonstrated that it is willing to hurl a virtually limitless number of young volunteers against Iraq in kamikaze-like assaults ( see following story ) . In three separate offensives last week , tens of thousands of Iranians , some of them barely nine or ten years old and armed merely with rifles and grenades , tried to break through Iraq 's defenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of the biggest battles yet in the murderous conflict . <P> As the week ended , the bodies of the fighters still littered the ground where they had made their assaults . " Either the Iranians will come to make peace with us , or we will kill them all , " said an Iraqi officer . " They can not take our land . " For miles behind the Iraqi lines , tanks , armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery were dug into the brown-gray sand . Iraqi forces seemed to be well supplied . " The Iranians attacked in waves , " said the Iraqi commander near a place in the wasteland called Al Azarh , " but they had no chance . " <P> Despite their appalling losses , the Iranians continued to hammer away at the strategically important highway that links Basra , Iraq 's second largest city and a key center of the country 's oil industry , to Baghdad , the capital . With 300,000 to 400,000 more soldiers massed along a ragged 370-mile section of the border , Iran appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
