A publishing house throws the book at one of its authors <P> It was bad enough when California courts ordered Novelist Gwen Davis and her publisher , Doubleday , to pay $75,000 last April to Hollywood Psychologist Paul Bindrim . He said he was defamed by Touching , Davis ' 1971 novel involving an encounter group whose gig is communal nudity in warm pools . Now Davis , 45 , feels doubly wronged : Doubleday has sued her for some $138,000 , which includes legal costs , the money Bindrim won and interest . Several authors ' groups and a number of writers , among them Irving Wallace , Gore Vidal and Joan Didion , have criticized the publisher for turning on one of its authors . <P> Davis contracted with Doubleday in 1969 to write a novel about two women who , in search of something missing in their lives , attend a " nude encounter workshop . " As part of her research , Davis spent 20 hours at the Los Angeles center where Bindrim pioneered the " nude marathon , " a therapy in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spend long periods talking and touching . Bindrim , 59 , describes this as a way to teach people " how to be more open toward one another and to relate in a more authentic and satisfying manner . " When Davis ' book appeared , a central figure in it was Simon Herford , a pudgy , sadistic California psychologist with a Ph.D. , described as " singularly Santa Clausy looking , " with long white hair and sideburns . In 1971 Bindrim sued Davis and Doubleday , claiming that the supposedly fictional Herford was obviously he , and that the book 's unsavory portrait was libelous . <P> When he arrived for the trial , the once clean-shaven Bindrim was sporting a full white beard and a recently acquired Ph.D . He produced tape recordings of the sessions that Davis attended ; many of Bindrim 's remarks appeared nearly verbatim in Touching . Bindrim was awarded $75,000-$50,000 to be paid jointly by Davis and Doubleday-plus $25,000 in penalties to be footed by the publisher alone . Last December , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the California ruling need not have broad implications for writers and publishers , since it came only from a lower state court and thus sets no precedent that courts elsewhere must follow . Nonetheless , many authors and publishers are understandably worried that it could spur similar suits involving other works of fiction , which in the past have rarely been the targets of libel actions . The Supreme Court 's decision to let the ruling stand , argues Vidal , is thus in effect " a hunting license , a declaration of open season on almost any sort of novelist . " <P> Writers are also riled by Doubleday 's suit against Davis . Like most such agreements , her contract for Touching contains an indemnity clause entitling Doubleday to recover costs it may have to bear as a result of a libel suit . But publishers , including Doubleday , have rarely invoked this clause . This time , however , Doubleday felt Davis had not leveled with her editor on the potential for trouble . The clause has to be invoked sometimes , reasons a publishing house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total mercy of someone who walks in and presents a manuscript . "
