Carter revises the new game plan for fighting a nuclear war <P> At the Naval War College in Newport , R.I. , this week , Secretary of Defense Harold Brown is to unveil officially the nuclear age 's ultimate contingency plan . To some critics , it is a doomsday scenario , an outline for atomic war that could lead to the destruction of the human race . But to U.S. defense policymakers , Brown 's speech represents an unavoidable rethinking of the unthinkable : bringing up to date U.S. strategic plans for deterring nuclear war . <P> Some details of the policy changes that Brown plans to announce have already been leaked , and they have drawn sizzling denunciations from Moscow . Thundered TASS : " Madness , " " Maniacal . " Cried Pravda : " Nuclear blackmail . " But NATO allies of the U.S. welcomed the change . Said a British official crisply : " We agree with it . It enhances deterrence . " Said a French official : " We are in favor of anything that improves U.S. credibility . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was signed on July 25 by Jimmy Carter . In it , the Administration modifies the doctrine of how the nation plans to respond to a Soviet nuclear strike . Brown is expected to say that in the future , more of the Pentagon 's land-based Minuteman ICBMS and B-52 bombers will be targeted at Soviet military installations and political and military command centers , as well as at major cities . Arms experts call this targeting concept " counterforce " because it is designed primarily to destroy the enemy 's forces rather than large numbers of civilians . In a note to the NATO allies two weeks ago , outlining the policy , Brown explained : " It is a strategy designed to make clear that we have both capabilities and plans for use of our forces if deterrence fails . That means that no plausible outcome of such a war could be a victory for the U.S.S.R. , however they may define victory . " <P> Some elements of counterforce have been part of U.S. strategy for decades . But the U.S. has relied largely on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The theory is that the U.S. 's ability to retaliate against a Soviet attack by obliterating the residents and factories of Moscow and other major cities would deter the Kremlin from launching a nuclear strike against America . In turn , the Soviet capability to destroy U.S. cities has been seen as deterring Washington from attacking the U.S.S.R. Because such a situation in effect holds hostage the population centers of both superpowers , theorists call the strategy a " balance of terror " and have credited it with preventing nuclear holocaust-so far . <P> The trouble with this policy , which was adopted during the Eisenhower years , is that the conditions upon which it rests have changed , primarily because of the relentless buildup of Soviet strategic forces and the vast improvement in the accuracy of the Kremlin 's nuclear warheads . The Soviets have achieved at least strategic parity with the U.S. ; at the current rate of increase , the Kremlin is certain to attain clear-cut superiority in just a few more years . And despite its outcry against the Presidential Directive , Moscow has already deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minuteman sites and other U.S. bases .
