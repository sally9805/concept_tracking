Oprah Winfrey , on her first visit to the White House , would have melted outdoors in her form-fitting long-sleeved black gown . Asked if it was bought for the occasion , she said , " It was in my closet ; I had no place to wear it. " // As the guests arrived , President Bush and his wife , Barbara , stood on North Portico waiting to greet Prime Minister and Mrs. Hawke and take them upstairs to the family quarters for a brief chat before descending the staircase to " Ruffles and Flourishes " and proceeding to the East Room. // Bowing to Washington ' s infamous summer weather , Mrs. Bush decided Monday that the state dinner tonight would be moved from the White House Rose Garden to the State Dining Room. // The dinner was then about 36 hours away , and the menu and decorations had been planned to take the outdoor setting into account : no chocolate because it would melt , white tablecloths to reflect light , and white flowers with some red for the same reason , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington hand , she reasoned that the 127 guests would gladly forefeit dinner in the candle-lighted garden on a humid summer evening. // In an interview today in the living quarters at the White House , Mrs. Bush said : " I took Millie for a walk Sunday night , " referring to the family dog . " I was wearing just a T-shirt and slacks , and when I came in I was dripping . I just can ' t do that to people . I thought of all the hairdos that will wilt and all the men who will swear at me . It ' s so beautiful with all the little lights in the trees and bushes , but it is cruel and unusual punishment. " // That decision was in keeping with the Bushes ' first priority : making their guests comfortable in the White House . The staff used the opportunity to add a chocolate-glazed shortbread to the menu but changed little else , accomplishing the move with grace and speed. // The White House has a staff of 93 men and women who are accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were doing it before the Bushes arrived and will continue to do so long after they have left . But Mrs. Bush in no ingenue either . She has had years of experience with state entertaining both here and abroad as the wife of a diplomat and Vice President . And she said she had chosen to leave most of the details to the staff , because she trusts them and is accustomed to working that way. // That is not to say that she has divorced herself from the flowers , the menus , the table settings , the guest lists , the entertainment . She has the final word . But the Bushes ' attitude toward the White House staff e has been to let them display their talents . Mrs. Bush told Gary Walters , who as the chief usher is the White House equivalent of a hotel ' s general manager , that she wanted things done the way Nancy Reagan did them unless she told him otherwise. // " I am willing to turn it over to someone else , " Mrs. Bush said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laurie Firestone , " referring to her social secretary. // " If I don ' t like it , I ' ll let them know , " she added . " Nancy Reagan was a perfectionist , and I am not . We have made some changes , but I never saw a household run as smoothly as this one. " // For the state dinner tonight Mrs. Bush chose to use the Reagan china , although she said her favorite is the wildflower pattern purchased during the Johnson Administration. // In a new situation Mrs. Bush said there are bound to be mistakes . In fact , there already have been . For the Bushes ' first state dinner , held earlier this month in honor of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan , Mrs. Bush said , " I jumped the gun and pulled George out with me before they played ' Hail to the Chief. ' " // To her such fine points of protocol are unimportant . " What does it matter as long as people have a good time ? " she said. // Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the place to make drastic changes . The State Department , which pays for these dinners , does not want anyone tinkering with protocol . ( Mrs. Bush did say the formal arrival ceremony today seemed silly since the Bushes had already entertained the Hawkes at Camp David . ) She and the President do have a lot to say about the guest lists . " George comes up with the most marvelous mix and makes it much more fun , " Mrs. Bush said . " I always giggle over the guest list George comes up with. " // " The state dinner is almost a formula , but you try to make it interesting , " Mrs. Bush said . " You try not to overload it with too many political types . You try to get a cross section. " // And in her usual thoughtful fashion Mrs. Bush has asked Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife , Marilyn , to choose a couple to attend. // Guests at White House dinners will not be aware of one of Mrs. Bush ' s most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted : Mrs. Bush usually just wants to try the main course. // Mrs. Reagan ' s tryout dinners , followed by a thorough critique , apparently struck terror in the hearts of the kitchen staff. // " The tryout dinners , " said Hans Raffert , the executive chef , " don ' t mention them . Don ' t plant the seed " // Squab was originally suggested for the dinner tonight , but after Mrs. Bush tried it , she rejected it , saying it did not look good . Pheasant was rejected because it is impossible to find 127 of suitable quality at this season . Roasted saddle of veal Perigourdine , a classic French dish , was the ultimate choice. // The Bushes encourage experimentation with American food but stick with tradition for state occasions. // " For state dinners we always have the same classical food , " Mr. Raffert said. // The menu for tonight ' s dinner reflects a subtle but definite change , part of the increasing modernization of White House menus in general . The endive is gone from the salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thyme vinaigrette . On trend-setting menus across the nation this assortment of greens , some of them wild , is known as mesclun . The cheese accompanying the salad course is not the ubiquitous Brie but a goat cheese from Westfield Farm in Massachusetts. // If it were up to the younger American-born assistants in the White House kitchen there would be fewer classic dishes on the menu and more of what is frequently called new American cooking . Frank Ruta , the 32-year-old sous-chef who shares responsibility for the family ' s meals with 30-year-old Sean Haddon , seeks out high-quality American ingredients. // And Mr. Raffert , who is 62 and was classically trained in his native Germany , is cooperative . " Hans leans toward things he knows , " said Mr. Ruta , who came to the White House in 1980 . " The rest of us who are a little younger and more agressive , we try to do things a little more current , but Hans has an open mind. // " We ' ve cut back on the cream and flour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for family meals , " he added . " I do a lot of vegetable-based sauces , too . Mrs. Reagan encouraged change. " // " But , " Mr. Ruta said , " working with the Bushes there is a lot more freedom than before . You ' d think they wouldn ' t care as much about food because of their relaxed style , but they do care , and Mrs. Bush loves trying new things. " // In the interview Mrs. Bush concurred . " You know , I don ' t order my own lunch , " she said and went on to describe in loving detail the " weird and wonderful " food she is served . " I ' m sort of a lusty eater , " she said. // The wines served at state dinners are American in origin . The practice of serving some American wines began during the Kennedy Administration . The Nixons were criticized for serving French wines , and since then American wines have been served at all public functions in the White House. // For tonight ' s dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Horse Brut Rose 1985 and Kalin Chardonnay 1987 . " It ' s our job to be selling America , " Mrs. Bush said. // Preparations for the dinner began several weeks ago when Mr. Raffert consulted with Mr. Walters , the chief usher , and Ms. Firestone , Mrs. Bush ' s social secretary . Mr. Raffert came to the White House in 1969 . He was assistant to Henry Haller , who retired in 1987 , and Mr. Raffert took over the job when the executive chef hired to replace Mr. Haller left. // By last Friday , most of the provisions for tonight ' s dinner were on hand , including the 150 pounds of Alaskan salmon from Prince William Sound , donated by Senator Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska . When a reporter , referring to the recent Valdez oil spill , asked Senator Stevens upon his arrival if the salmon was leaded or unleaded , he replied , " unleaded. " // Within the White House the staff worked on Sunday , making the stock for the truffle sauce to be served with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boning the veal and baking some of the cookies to be served with the ice cream and sorbet bombe. // By this afternoon , the salmon had its five coats of aspic , the salad was ready to be put on plates , the petits fours had been arranged and the 13 bombes , one for each table , had been unmolded . Two hours before the dinner , the veal was cooking and the cheese bow ties were baked . At 8 P.M. , just before the guests went in to dinner , the vegetables were cooked , the potatoes deep-fried. // Roland Mesnier , who is 45 and has been the White House pastry chef for 10 years , and his assistant , Franette McCulloch , had been working on several things at once for days . In between the dinner preparations on Monday , they prepared a dessert for several Bush grandchildren who were having lunch at the pool . No plastic plate may have ever held a more elaborate creation : floating island on raspberry puree topped with caramelized pecans and syrup and a few artfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Mesnier says he is in seventh heaven with the Bush family . " We are using many more sweets now , even at cocktail parties , " he said . " We are busier than we have ever been before . The Carters were very traditional in their tastes . The Reagans were always searching for new things . Now there is a little bit of both. " // Mr. Mesnier prides himself on never creating the same dessert twice at the White House. // Not since the Johnsons occupied the White House has there been so much entertaining . Comparing Lyndon Johnson and George Bush , Bess Abell , who was Lady Bird Johnson ' s social secretary , said : " These two men feel they are in their hometown . They are inviting their pals over . Both had been the White House quite a lot and wanted to share the family quarters with their chums . Just like George Bush , Johnson also did a lot of tours of the family quarters. " // Friends say the Bushes have always entertained a lot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one White House staff member who has known them a long time . " It ' s new to the world , but the President was always calling up Mrs. Bush and saying , ' I ' m bringing so and so home . ' He loves having people over and doing business in a social setting. " // When the Bushes first arrived , the kitchen staff told them they were used to having a week or two notice . " I told them , " Mrs. Bush said , " that I ' d been married to George for 44 years and I never had gotten a week ' s notice .
