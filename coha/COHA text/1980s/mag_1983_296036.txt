On a tennis court in Miami last fall , West Coast Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate commented to Caribbean Bureau Chief William McWhirter on the huge increase he had observed in the use of cocaine among middle-class Americans . <P> McWhirter responded by citing estimates on the growing traffic in the drug through his South Florida territory . <P> Says McWhirter : " We realized we were talking about two ends of the same pipeline . Like oil , cocaine had become a major commodity . I had the suppliers , he had the consumers . " From there , under Gate 's coordination , reporting this week 's cover story on the epidemic spread of cocaine was fairly straightforward . McWhirter concentrated on the criminal activities of importers and suppliers and the law 's efforts to control them .

Gate and New York Correspondent Janice Simpson interviewed dozens of cocaine users , former users and dealers in an effort to put together a series of profiles . Says Gate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was not easy . Getting these people to discuss their habits , lifestyles and thoughts required the establishment of trust , and that takes time . " In one instance , however , there was a reward : one young woman ex-user who confided in Gate later wrote him .

" <P> In New York , Simpson found the assignment " the most depressing I 've had in my ten years as a journalist . These people were not stereotypical junkies ; they were just ordinary people , the kind you would meet at a dinner party . And that made the stories they told about lying and stealing and spending every penny they could lay their hands on that much more frightening . I kept thinking this does n't happen to nice people ; we know how to keep these things under control . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point with horrifying realism , New York Correspondent James Wilde went with a cash-laden couple on a Sunday drug-buying trip to " Alphabet Town " on Manhattan 's Lower East Side . Wilde 's report accompanies the cover story . <P> The cover was designed by Deputy Art Director Nigel Holmes and Design Consultant Tom Bentkowski . To fashion the " cokehead , " they used nearly 100 one-gram packets of powdered artificial sweetener . " We found that it photographed the best , " says Bentkowski . Just as well ; obtaining the real thing not only would have been illegal but would have cost $10,000.
