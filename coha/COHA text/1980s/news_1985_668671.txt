Dear Abby : First off , we are in our mid-30s , both educated with good incomes . My fiance , " John , " is very tight with money . When we eat out , he refuses to leave a tip , no matter how good the service . He says tipping is unnecessary ; I think he is just plain cheap . I ' ve explained that people who wait on tables often work for minimum wage , and count on their tips to supplement their income . He refuses to budge . It ' s gotten so that every time we enter a restaurant , I can feel my stomach knotting up . John and I take turns picking up the tab , which is only fair . When it ' s my treat , I always leave a tip . There are many pluses in our relationship , but our philosophies on spending money are worlds apart . This will be the second marriage for both of us , and I never want to go through another divorce . What are your feelings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that the difference in your philosophies on spending money was of sufficient importance to warrant a letter to Dear Abby  --  and you were right . Regardless of how many " pluses " there are in your relationship , John ' s penny-pinching reveals a rather mean- spirited pettiness that you may find hard to live with . Don ' t tie the knot with any man who consistently puts knots in your stomach . Dear Abby : I checked a book out of the public library last November and I must have lost it somewhere , because I have turned this house upside down and I can ' t find it ! I must owe a fortune in fines by now , and I can ' t tell my parents or they will kill me . What should I do ? I need to know if there is a limit on how much I can be fined . What if the book costs $6 brand-new and the fine amounts to a whole lot more ? I feel so nervous and guilty , I haven ' t been back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t say where this is from . Book Loser Dear Book Loser : Every library sets its own policy . At the Los Angeles County Public Library , children are fined 5 cents a day per book for every day the library is open . Adults are fined 15 cents a day . If the fine exceeds the cost of replacing the book , one pays for replacing the book . Should the book be destroyed by a natural disaster such as flood , fire or earthquake , there is no charge . Go to the library and tell the librarian that the book is lost and be prepared to pay for a replacement . Dear Abby : I am 10 years old and I read your letters every day . I get very disgusted when kids complain about having to wear hand-me-downs . There is nothing wrong with hand-me-downs . My mother is a schoolteacher and the pay isn ' t that great . Mom ' s best friend has a daughter who ' s 13 , and I get all the nice clothes she has outgrown . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not stiff and the sweaters aren ' t scratchy .
