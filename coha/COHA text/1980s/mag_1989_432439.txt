 | There are some dark secrets in the car tester 's closet , and one of them is that testing fast is n't always the same as going fast . It 's not uncommon for a car to clock single-digit 0-to-60-mph times without impressing the seat of your pants , particularly when the car is turbocharged , and the standing start at the test track is preceded by revving the engine to the redline and dumping the clutch . The real world is n't always so controlled . Say you 're crawling up a grade behind a wall full of travel stickers on the back of some guy 's Airstream trailer , and you pull out to pass . That 's when turbo lag rears its ugly head . A stab at the gas pedal is rewarded with a long , slow buildup as the turbo goes into its act . Boost painstakingly rises , and finally the car gets going with a rush . But by that time you 've already passed the guy and his trailer , and now you 're in blastoff mode just when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the sluggish response of some high-horsepower turbocharged cars is promised by the development of variable-nozzle turbochargers ( VNT ) Cover story , May ' 88 . These innovative new devices use a ring of vanes around the turbine wheel to precisely direct the exhaust gas stream for maximum efficiency . @# By speeding up the exhaust flow at medium engine speeds , the turbocharger 's turbine wheel can get to its optimum speed quickly and improve throttle response . This new turbo technology made its debut this spring on a limited-volume Shelby CSX , based on the Dodge Shadow sports coupe . And Chrysler plans to add this innovative turbocharger to other models in the 1990 model year . Turbo-charged debate Is VNT the answer to turbo lag ? It 's the type of question that leads to endless debate without much substance . We decided to try for a more definitive answer . To start with , we gathered together a 1989 Shelby CSX with the VNT Turbo IV intercooled turbocharging system and an older sister , a late-1987 Shelby CSX equipped with most of the Turbo II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-cylinder engine and are rated at an identical 175 horsepower , although the newer Shelby CSX develops more torque . To see where turbocharging fits into the larger engine picture , we also tested a 1989 Ford Thunderbird Super Coupe with a 3.8-liter V6 engine boosted by a belt-driven Roots-type supercharger Cover story , Jan. ' 871 . And as a base line , we looked at the throttle response of a 1990 Plymouth Laser equipped with a 16-valve two-liter four-cylinder engine that operates at atmospheric pressure . Range of power and weight The group of four cars included several combinations of weight and power . The Thunderbird Super Coupe is substantially heavier than either Shelby CSX and , despite its 210-hp output , has a power-to-weight ratio of 18.6 pounds per horsepower , slightly worse than the ' 89 Shelby 's 16.1 lb. /hp . The ' 87 Shelby CSX weighs 100 pounds lighter than its newer Shelby cousin and has an advantageous 15.3 lb. /hp ratio . The weight difference is accounted for by the ' 89 CSX 's heavy-duty suspension , extra sound-deadening material , and heavier ground-effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the older Shelby CSX , but with 135 hp available , it has a power-to-weight ratio of 19.8 lb. /hp . The mismatch would make raw-acceleration comparisons more or less predictable , but we were more interested in testing how quickly the cars responded to a stab at the gas pedal , not which one pulled ahead faster from a stoplight . We quickly discovered that testing a car 's responsiveness is considerably trickier than testing its raw acceleration to 60 mph . To begin with , while the differences in horsepower-to-weight ratios indicated we could expect a range of acceleration times , all three boosted cars were within 0.9 second of each AUGUST 1989 129 @#  | other at reaching 60 mph . The supercharged Thunderbird blasted to 60 mph first , in 7.8 seconds , just 0.3 second ahead of the VNT-equipped Shelby CSX . The standard turbo-equipped Shelby got to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds , and the lower-powered Laser took 10.3 seconds . Responsiveness testing But we wanted to test for response , and 0-to-60-mph times can be misleading . A fast run at the drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish or a quick blastoff followed by a letdown . We wanted to profile the car 's acceleration , because contests like this are won or lost in the blink of an eye . In search of a better measure of throttle response , we decided the determining factor should be how quickly each car reached its maximum acceleration , even if the peak differed from car to car . Even more significant was each car 's pattern of acceleration . A quick-responding car should show a steeper climb to its maximum acceleration , while a lagging car would be likely to start at a lower plateau , then rise slowly . The instrument to do this is the g.Analyst , developed by Valentine Research ( see box , G whiz ! ) . The g.Analyst measures acceleration and records it in one-tenth of a second intervals . This device gives acceleration readings at any point in time . Our hope was that the g.Analyst would give us a way to actually measure how long it takes to get to peak acceleration ? rather than relying on gut feelings . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Track tests aside , however , the basic principles and engineering behind the various systems of horsepower enhancement seemed to give one an edge over the others . Turbo theory Slow throttle response has plagued turbochargers since they began showing up in significant numbers in the United States in the 1970s after gaining popularity in Europe . They were popular because they seemed to promise something for everybody in the midst of an energy crisis . But there was a major drawback : less than crisp response . The idea involves designing a small displacement engine that can become a tiger on demand . When you do n't need extra power , the engine is a fuel sipper . But step hard on the accelerator pedal , and the boost comes on . Extra air is forced into the engine , so it can burn more fuel and produce greater power output . What 's more , the compressor that jams the extra air in is driven by the heat of the exhaust ? almost a free ride , because this waste heat would otherwise be dumped into the atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced turbocharging , not only for performance cars , but eventually for sedans and minivans . Chrysler 's limited supply of large-displacement engines encouraged attempts to power a wide variety of models with derivatives of its basic 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine that delivered 92 hp in atmospheric-pressure form . Turbocharging brought the engine 's power up to the level of competitive V6s , but at the cost of throttle response . Chrysler engineers were quick to realize turbocharging 's limitations . Early models used a relatively large Garrett T3 turbocharger that was originally designed for small trucks . The weight @# @#  | and volume of the unit meant the turbine shaft accelerated slowly , so response suffered . Later Chrysler used a lighter turbocharger that improved response , but was still fall from ideal . Though the engine produced 142 hp , it still was sluggish in response to throttle commands . In 1987 Chrysler began using the Turbo II system , which sported an intercooler that reduced the temperature of the pressurized air and raised its density to allow higher boost pressures . Power output from the 2.2-liter block increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again using a relatively heavy Garrett turbocharger . Turbo transitions Each transition for Chrysler was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in turbo lag . But one trade-off particularly bothered development engineers : When a large-volume turbo that promised high horsepower was installed , throttle response was poor . However , a smaller , quick-to-respond turbo lacked the high-output potential of a larger unit . This dichotomy led to the joint development project between Garrett Automotive and Chrysler to engineer the variable-nozzle turbocharger , which essentially takes the best attributes of each turbo design . The variable-nozzle turbo is based on the lightweight T25 Garrett unit and contains a ring of pivoting vanes surrounding the exhaust turbine . The vanes move on demand to constrict the exhaust flow at low engine speeds and open at high rpm . The principle is something like closing down one end of a garden hose to increase water pressure and make its stream shoot farther . When the turbo 's vanes close , the exhaust velocity increases , which spinthe turbine wheel quickly to its optimum operating speed . Principle and operation While the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires elaborate electronic controls and specially designee parts . For one thing , because the vanes constrict exhaust flow to increase exhaust gas velocity , additional back pressure in the exhaust is created . If not properly timed this can shut off the engine completely . It 's worth noting that the vanes ca n't do everything . When the engine is below approximately 1,800 rpm , there is not enough exhaust flow to keep the turbine wheel spinning even with the vanes at maximum constriction . The use of the variable-vane system thus addresses only one component of turbo lag . By giving the turbocharger 's turbine wheel enough exhaust-gas velocity at relatively low engine speeds , it is kept spinning . Under these conditions a conventional turbo remains near a standstill . Another component of turbo lag is the inertia of the turbine wheels and the shaft assembly itself . Some earlier efforts , notable the Buick GNX high-output turbocharged V6 , experimented with ceramics to lighten the wheel assembly anc quicken the speed with which the turbo accelerated . But this fix required exacting manufacturing procedures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuck with conventional materials . To take the abuse of 1,650-degree-F exhaust gas , @#  | the vane-control mechanism is made of cast stainless steel , and the ring that the vanes sit in is made of a variety of hardened stainless steel . Early in the development of variablevane technology , Garrett engineers noticed that the wake produced by each vane was causing the tip of the turbine wheel 's blades to break up . Tests using holographic films of the wheel @# @# led to a redesign of the wheel with a more sturdy structure . The Shelby CSX Turbo IV system is calibrated to keep the turbine wheel spinning at about half its maximum 177,000 rpm under partial throttle conditions . This requires careful control of the vacuum actuator that positions the vanes . For example , at about 2,700 rpm and a steady speed of 35 mph , the engine throttle is barely open , exhaust flow is minimal , and the vanes are partially shut . A stab at the throttle momentarily closes the vanes to their minimum openings , increasing back pressure and choking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fraction of a second , power actually drops off . But then the vanes quickly open to the best setting , spinning the turbo up to @# @#  | speed . Within about 0.4 second , according to Chrysler , the turbo is at maximum speed , pumping extra air into the engine . This is in dramatic contrast to the standard turbo , which responds to a wide-open throttle with a slow run-up of the turbine wheel that can easily take 1.5 seconds . Another difference between the two systems is how they limit maximum boost pressure . The VNT vanes close to isolate the turbine wheel from the exhaust flow to reduce boost . In the more basic turbo setup , a waste gate opens to dump excess turbocharger pressure at high speeds . Both turbos use a water-cooled center bearing to cure a problem common with earlier turbochargers : heat buildup in the unit following a quick shutdown ? such as using the car for short trips . This was sometimes severe enough to carbonize the lubricating oil and lead to bearing failure . Theory and practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested in how each engine performed at the track . The standard-turbo Shelby CSX was a late-1987 model rated at 175 hp at 5,300 rpm , with 175 lb. - ft. of torque available at 2,400 rpm . The 1989 Shelby CSX is powered by the new Turbo IV VNT system that extracts the same 175 hp out of the 2.2-liter engine , but has 210 lb. - ft. of torque at lower engine speeds . The numbers are deceptive . The higher torque rating of the VNTequipped engine is programmed to come in at lower engine speed , then decrease as the engine peaks . This saves wear and tear on the car 's fivespeed manual transmission , which is near its limit of torque capacity , according to Chrysler engineers . Our efforts with the g.Analyst demonstrated both the advantages and disadvantages of the VNT . In a secondgear run-up , starting at 3,250 rpm at 30 mph , the constricting vane action of the VNT was noticeable as the oldstyle turbo accelerated stronger for the first 0.8 second ( see graph ) . Then the VNT-equipped car jumped ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second faster than its older sibling without the VNT . A similar run in fourth gear proved the VNT to have an even greater advantage over the standard turbo , because the initial speed of the turbine wheel was lower at the point the throttle was opened . And in our top-gear passing test the VNT-equipped Shelby CSX excelled , taking 9.1 seconds to accelerate from 50 to 70 mph , nearly two seconds quicker than the standardturbo Shelby CSX.  | The VNT proved its worth , but our comparison cars ? the supercharged Thunderbird and the atmosphericpressure Laser ? ended up with bragging rights for real-world throttle response . Neither of the turbocharged engines came close to the supercharged engine in terms of throttle response . The beltdriven blower on the Thunderbird Super Coupe runs in lock step with the crankshaft , but at 2.6 times its speed . When the throttle is opened , a valve dumps the air that is already moving and circulating in a bypass loop through the supercharger directly into the manifold , giving near-instantaneous boost . The Super Coupe reached its maximum acceleration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured for a boosted car . The ability to pump air quickly into the manifold not only means that lag time is reduced , but also that the supercharger can effectively offset the sluggishness that comes from lowering the compression ratio on force-fed engines . However , reduced fuel economy is the price paid for the extra horsepower that 's produced when using a blower on the engine . For the most part , this is due to the parasitic drag of the supercharging mechanism , which spins whether its pressurized air is being used or not . At full boost the blower consumes up to 60 hp , but at a light throttle , say cruising at 55 mph , it drains a mere half horsepower , according to Ford . Most surprising was that under some conditions , the low-powered Laser responded the best , despite having the slowest 0-to-60-mph performance of the group . Starting with the engine running near its optimal power band at 30 mph in second gear , the Laser took 1.4 seconds to reach maximum acceleration . In higher gears it reached peak acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stable rate where the rising engine torque was balanced against the vehicle 's aerodynamic drag as the speed increased . Better , but ... Our conclusion : Controlling the exhaust flow with the VNT is clearly superior to conventional turbocharging , and with proper calibration it is capable of making the turbo more acceptable for real-world driving conditions . Its biggest advantage is responding to a wide-open throttle at medium engine speeds ? a typical passing situation on the highway . On the other hand the VNT is nonoperative at low engine speeds . There remains a noticeable hesitation before the system builds boost in the early stages as compared with the standard turbo and overall when compared with supercharging . Even a half second can seem like a long time when you 're in the left lane passing a truck on a two-lane road . Last , like any new technology , it has to work in harmony with the rest of the car . The Shelby CSX was a marginal car at best . The 210 lb. - ft. of torque easily walked the front end around under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs , shocks , and sway bars all made for quick 56.6-mph double-lane change and 64.0-mph slalom scores , but were rough on the posterior . With so much power , lack of steering precision made the car uncomfortable . Chrysler 's balance-shaft fourcylinder engine , smoother transmission , and better worked-out suspension would help do the VNT justice . But when you want to step out to pass , the VNT is the answer . @#
