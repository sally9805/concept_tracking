CANNERY ROW Directed and Written by DavidS . Ward <P> This is the Depression as a dream - no breadlines , no sitdown strikes , no Dust Bowl . Cannery Row is visibly a movie set , splendidly designed by Rich ard MacDonald and photographed by Sven Nykvist a subtle shade away from the realistic . The burns and hookers who inhabit it are seen as sweet dreamers whose great preoccupation is bringing together Doc ( Nick Nolte ) , a sometime baseball pitcher , and Suzy ( Debra Winger ) , a reluctant " floozy " who talks tough but is as lost in fantasy as everyone else . <P> If the shabby cupids of Cannery Row knew anything about old movies , they 'd know that two people who take such an instant dislike to each other are bound to end up together . They might have spared themselves much trouble that is not as funny and dear as David Ward , working from two John Steinbeck novels ( the other is Sweet Thursday ) , thinks it is . Debra Winger is a tart tart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad movie . But Ward , who wrote The Sting , seems to think that what they canned on Cannery Row was not fish but fruit . There is a peachy , syrupy quality to the film that first then chokes . <P> - By Richard Schickel
