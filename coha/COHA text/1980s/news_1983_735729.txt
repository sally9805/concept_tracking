txt Alan Maislin resigned as vice chairman of Maislin Industries Ltd. , the trucking concern whose main subsidiaries in Canada and the U.S. sought court protection from their creditors last Monday . In announcing his resignation , Mr. Maislin said he was protesting the refusal of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to honor paychecks issued by Maislin Transport Ltd. to its employees prior to its filing last Monday for protection from creditors under Canada 's Bankruptcy Act . Under that proposal , Maislin Transport , the main Canadian unit of Maislin Industries , is seeking a moratorium on payment to its creditors until Oct. 31 . Mr. Maislin , a member of the Montreal family that controls Maislin Industries , could n't be contacted , but he said in a local radio interview that the bank 's refusal to honor the checks was n't justified . Mr. Maislin also said that the net result of $34 million ( Canadian ) in loan guarantees provided by the Canadian government last year in an attempt to rescue the parent was " to raise the capital of the company by only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely free hand . " A bank spokesman said Mr. Maislin 's comments " do n't appear to be compatible with the facts , " adding : " We are acting carefully and responsibly while cooperating with the trustees during this holding period . " Canadian Imperial Bank is owed about $40 million by Maislin Transport and has additional loans outstanding to five Maislin subsidiaries in the U.S. that filed for protection from their creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code last week . Employees of Maislin Transport demonstrated in front of the company 's headquarters in suburban Montreal last week and tried to disrupt truck movements in and out of Maislin 's main terminal to protest the bank 's refusal to honor their paychecks . About 3,500 workers in the U.S. and Canada have been laid off as a result of the bankruptcy actions , but several hundred others have been kept on to wind down company operations . The company said arrangements have been made to pay those employees by certified checks .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
