Correspondent Mary Cronin had known for days that Dan Rather of CBS 's 60 Minutes had received big-money offers from all three major networks , and the promise of Walter Cronkite 's job if he would stay with CBS . She also knew , from her talks with Rather himself , that the newsman hoped to choose from among the offers by last Wednesday . " What I did n't know , and what had me pacing the floors that day , was how Rather would decide , " says Cronin . " And he did n't know that himself , even when he called me at 11 o'clock that night . " No matter . Rather 's very indecision underscored the point of Cronin 's extensive reporting for this week 's cover story on the tumult in TV journalism . " CBS had always been the Tiffany of network news , " she says . " That it was even conceivable for a superstar like Dan Rather to go to another network shows precisely how radically things are changing . " <P> Cronin has been watching fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first as a reporter-researcher in TIME 's Show Business section and then as a correspondent in the New York bureau . Since last November , she has been tracing the developments in the TV news business that led to the wooing of Rather . Cronin interviewed dozens of news executives , producers and correspondents at the networks and in public television , as well as Walter Cronkite . " That , " she says , " was like interviewing God . " <P> Staff Writer Stephen Smith , who wrote the main narrative , became TIME 'S Press writer in November 1978 . An interest in print journalism came instinctively to Smith , a former senior editor at Horizon magazine and reporter for the Boston Globe , the Philadelphia Inquirer and other newspapers . But today he is a " network news junkie " as well ; he watches an hour of TV news each morning and another hour at night , and sets his alarm clock each week to catch his favorite show , CBS 's Sunday Morning , " perhaps the most imaginative and creative news experiment going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Sunday to see Charles Kuralt and colleagues put the program together at a CBS studio in Manhattan . <P> The fan was not disappointed . Says Smith : " Just watching half-a-dozen people manipulating the control panel was tremendously exciting for a guy who works alone with a typewriter . "
