The man on the phone was angry . What he wanted , he said , was a home inspection . What he got was nothing more than a checklist describing the house . Unfortunately , he ' s not alone . While it ' s true that more and more buyers are hiring impartial third- party inspectors to give their would-be new homes a thorough going-over before completing their transactions , it ' s also true that more are not getting what they paid for . At the very least , a home buyer who puts out $150 to $250 for an inspection should receive a narrative report that identifies any and all major deficiencies . What my caller got for his $200 was a printed form with a few blanks filled in . The heating plant is gas-fired , the so-called report noted , the floor in the dining room is hardwood and the windows have two panes of glass . It made no mention of the fact that the wood frames around the windows had dry-rotted . Or that the damage had been concealed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my caller off . " I ' ve seen that kind of report , " says Ron Passaro , a Redding , Conn. , home inspector , in somewhat of an understatement . " It ' s very shallow and not very helpful . " Passaro is the national spokesman for the American Society of Home Inspectors , a group founded in 1976 to establish formal inspection and reporting guidelines and create a code of ethics for a profession where morality to some practitioners is a four-letter word . Today , ASHI has only about 600 members in 10 chapters , so there still are not that many quality inspectors to go around . Of course , an inspector doesn ' t have to be an ASHI member to be competent . But in a field where only a few states have licensing requirements , it usually is safer to use one who subscribes to at least some set of standards . To eliminate conflicts of interest , for example , ASHI members are forbidden to be involved in the sale of real estate , or to refer repair work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days , many inspectors had commission-based positions with real estate brokers , so they were likely to give biased reports . And sometimes they used the inspection to obtain additional work . Although ASHI leaves the method of inspection up to individual members , the organization requires that , as a minimum , the buyer must be told the present condition of the property and which items will need to be repaired or replaced in the near future . " That ' s the least we ' re allowed to do , " says Passaro , an ASHI founder who operates Residential Inspection Technology Inc . " We can do more , but not any less . " The inspection must include an evaluation of the central heating and air conditioning system , interior plumbing and electrical systems , roofing , insulation , ventilation , walls , ceilings , floors , windows , doors and the foundation . Some ASHI members go beyond the basic evaluation to report the probable life expectancy of the various items . And some even go as far as suggesting repair methods and estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left to each member . And , while some members still use the checklist approach , a narrative report written in the inspector ' s own words is much more helpful . What ' s even more helpful is to accompany the inspector on his rounds , even if you have to take a day off from work . " We think it ' s so important that the client be with us that we almost embarrass him into going along if we have to , " says Passaro . " Half the value of the report , " he said , " is being there to see firsthand what the inspector is talking about . " If the client is not with us , he won ' t have the rhetoric that puts things in their proper perspective . " For example , if we find a fracture in the basement wall that ' s cosmetic rather than structural and he ' s not there to see the problem or discuss it with us , his eyes will stop at the word ' fracture ' when he reads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmetic . ' " But if he accompanies us , we can explain that the crack is probably nothing to worry about , that foundation cracks are often not structural , but simply the result of shrinkage or minor settlement . " Many inspectors also use the tour to educate their clients about how to operate and care for the house . Learning how the house works  --  where the hearts of the various systems are located , for example , and how to shut them off in an emergency  --  is particularly valuable for first-time owners who in the past always called the rental office when something went wrong . Novice homeowner or expert , it also helps to know how to change the furnace filter , adjust the thermostat and operate the electrical circuit breaker . To obtain all the benefits a home inspection can provide , shop for an inspector before you find the house , not after . If you wait , you ' re liable to be forced into accepting something less . The nature of the real estate transaction is such that there isn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a house inspected after signing a contract . But if the inspector is lined up in advance , all you have to do once you find a house is set up a time when you can meet him . In checking out inspectors , ask first if they are ASHI members . They can be found in the Yellow Pages under " Building Inspection Services . " Also ask if the inspection goes beyond the basic ASHI requirements , which are national , to cover regional variations . In Florida , for example , inspectors generally will inspect swimming pools as part of their service at no extra charge . In Connecticut , on the other hand , pools usually aren ' t covered , but septic tanks are . Finally , don ' t forget to ask for a sample copy of that all-important written report.
