As the Soviet Union 's most loyal ally in Eastern Europe , stolid Bulgaria has always followed in Moscow 's footsteps . The economic reform drive launched by Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev seemed no exception to that rule . In a startling turn away from its hard-line policies of the past , the regime headed by Communist Party Leader Todor Zhivkov , 76 , swiftly followed Gorbachev 's lead . From promised press freedoms to plans for a new commercial banking ! system , Zhivkov 's program seemed intended , as a Western diplomat in Sofia put it , " to out-Gorbachev Gorbachev . " <P> No more . Since the New Year , virtually all of Bulgaria 's new initiatives appear to have been put on hold amid indications that the hastily implemented reforms were creating economic havoc . Some factories closed after managers panicked when called on to make decisions and failed to issue essential orders . New banks did little business , in part because few Bulgarians understood commercial finance . The media remained mostly muzzled . At last month 's party conference , Zhivkov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted that " revolutionary changes " would continue in Bulgaria . Stressing that Bulgaria 's development henceforth would be " stage by stage , " Zhivkov indicated that some major reforms would be delayed until 1991 . <P> The abrupt slowdown seemed to reflect Soviet misgivings about Sofia 's hurried embrace of change . Last October , Zhivkov was summoned to Moscow for a meeting with Gorbachev . Afterward , Gorbachev released a communique stating , " It is impossible to do everything in one go , " and advising that " the party is the only guarantee of the restructuring . " Western analysts read the message as a rebuke to Zhivkov for a reform drive that was long on rhetoric and short on action , and concluded that Gorbachev was issuing a warning to the East bloc as a whole : Do not allow reform to affect the dominant role of the Communist Party . <P> Amid the ebb and flow of promises , daily life remains drab for ordinary Bulgarian citizens . Western experts estimate that the standard of living has stagnated or dropped slowly over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $250 , compared with $350 for Czechoslovakia . The economy provides adequate supplies of staples but little else . Young people feel especially frustrated at the lack of real reform . Says a 20-year-old Sofia steelworker : " We 're all hoping for big changes and new leadership . But we do n't expect them soon . " <P> Organized dissent is nonexistent in such a tightly controlled society ; in any case , deep-seated nationalism has cemented widespread , largely unquestioning loyalty to the system . The folksy Zhivkov , after nearly 34 years in power , remains remarkably popular , especially with rural Bulgarians , and is believed to be in good health . He has shown no inclination to move off the political stage but has hinted that he may retire within the next two years . No one knows whether that too is a reform that might be pushed back .
