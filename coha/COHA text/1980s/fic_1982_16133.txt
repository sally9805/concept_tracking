Fade in : Int : Black limbo  --  sound stage An Oscar statuette is spinning in a darkened void . We hear O.S. voice of Mignon Dupree quoting from Ralph Ellison 's Shadow and Act : MIGNON DUPREE .

The industry 's broad sphere of service in the war effort is perhaps without parallel . The fact that no other medium is so adapted to the task of building and sustaining national morale on both the fighting and home fronts , readily attests to the motion picture 's essentiality .

Louise is freshening her lipstick ; she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until &nbsp; LOUISE ( surprised ) Why , good morning Miss Dupree . . . My , do n't you look smashing . Louise looks like she should be " in pictures " ; there are remnants of the melodrama in her voice and from her actions we can assume that she is a failed starlet . &nbsp; MIGNON ( firmly ) Good morning , Louise . Mignon opens her telegram and reads : Section Details Insert telegram : " U.S. Office of War Information : American Indians Fighting to Save Democracy . . . 3,000 Navaho Indians serving in the U.S. Marine Corps trained as communications experts . . . by sending and receiving messages in their language , they have created a code that the enemy can not break !

Throughout the reading of the telegram and Mignon 's conversation with Louise , we continue to hear the O.S. dictation coming from Lt. Bedsford . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORD ( O.S. ) . . . Americans will watch World War II from a grandstand seat . . .

BEDSFORD ( indicating Forrester 's office ) I see the old man has everyone hopping about as usual . ( to Mignon , much like an order ) Perhaps you 'd like to share lunch with me , say , about an hour from now . Mignon waits a few precious beats before responding . &nbsp; MIGNON ( annoyed ) Lt. Bedsford , you have been assigned here for six weeks . And for six weeks I have endured you . . . your official greetings memorandums , your off-color jokes , and your flirtation.

BEDSFORDPicked it up by mistake , reflex action and all that . . . I saw the government seal and thought it was for me . . . Mignon pulls an envelope from his hands in anger , knowing that he has taken her personal mail so that he might be able to approach her once again . Mignon slaps his face , a blow that quiets the entire office . She then storms into her own office . Humiliated in a roomful of women , Lt. Bedsford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studios , C. J. Forrester 's office . Day C. J. Forrester , head of production , is engaged in a heated conversation when Mignon enters . A very attractive blonde clerk is seated atop Mignon 's desk ; she too holds a telephone to her ear . The blonde looks desperately at Forrester , unable to continue with her own pressured conversation . She gives Mignon the once-over as she slides her hip from Mignon 's desktop . &nbsp; C. J. FORRESTER ( into telephone ) I assure you dear fellow , my plight is quite genuine . . . we manufacture a product and we have to get it out on time . We 're talking box office , all-time film attendance records are being set . . . Instead of reclaiming her desk and rescuing the blonde from a difficult business call , Mignon allows the clerk to stew in her own perfume . Mignon settles herself in a leather chair across from the two of them .

You 're a great pinch-hitter . The blonde saunters off toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving with a swish of her hips . Forrester checks and resets his watch . Mignon waits before speaking . We can sense from her manner that this is her milieu , the high-tension , fast-paced middle ground where deals are negotiated , fortunes are made and lost . We can also sense that Mignon enjoys the power that emanates from this office and her own relationship within : a tacit agreement of partnership as C. J. Forrester 's assistant . When the moment is right , she speaks . &nbsp; MIGNON ( matter of factly ) Billy Chase wants a three-picture deal before he agrees to do a rewrite on Tokyo Bomber . Forrester pours himself a stiff drink from the office bar . With glass in hand , he offers a toast to Mignon as she returns to her desk . &nbsp; FORRESTER ( to Mignon ) Here 's to Billy ! &nbsp; MIGNON ( sticking to business ) He likes his eggs poached , his salmon smoked , and he eats one meal a day . Breakfast . His eyes tell me he 's off the juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MIGNONI detest eggs . . . but he 's our man . Forrester crosses the office to enter his private washroom . &nbsp; FORRESTER ( lightly ) Ah , but considering the times my dear . . . at least you got to eat .  --  6  --  While listening to the water running , Mignon waits . In this listless but opportune moment she rises from her seated position gathering together her resolve , then &nbsp; MIGNON . C. JI think the time is right for a change . . . ( a few beats , then ) We do n't need another war film . National Studios should be the first to begin paying more attention to the effects of the war on the average person . We have too many heroes when most of these boys do n't even return in one piece . Forrester , towel-drying his hands &nbsp; FORRESTER ( smiling ) Slow down , what 's gotten into you today . . .

J. , let me take on a project , let me show you what I can do ! Forrester is relieved , this is not a new confrontation , nor menstrual tension . &nbsp; FORRESTERNonsense , we 've been through this before . Moving to the wall mirror , Forrester manipulates his tie watching Mignon from the reflection in the mirror . &nbsp; FORRESTERWhy , you 're one of the few women in all Hollywood . . . in all of the country , my dear , who has the power to make executive decisions . Why you damn near run this office . Turning to face her . &nbsp; FORRESTERSo what 's all this about producing again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not an altogether happy lot , you know . Mignon helps him put on his jacket , as he rechecks his wrist watch . &nbsp; FORRESTERWe meet in ten minutes . . . &nbsp; MIGNON ( not defeated ) I could do it , C. J. &nbsp; FORRESTER ( becoming annoyed ) Sure you could , but it 's not a simple matter of could . We do what 's best . What 's best for National Studios , what 's best for the times , why we 're working for the public and we do what 's best for them . ( becoming inspired ) Right now they need stories that come alive on the screen . Personal stories of triumphant ideals . . . magnifications of the kid next door . . . We have too many producers and not enough good story ideas . While Forrester leads Mignon from the office , &nbsp; MIGNON ( rushing ) We have plenty of good story ideas .

Hell , it 's a viable story but there 's no audience for that kind of story . Forrester stops , to make his point hit home . &nbsp; FORRESTERYou 're a good kid , and you 're gon na go far , so listen to me . If you want to get ahead in this business you 've got to learn how to cut out the fat . Just between you and me . Oh heck , I get social interest stories coming in like this every day . . .

Cut to : Section Details Int : Rerecording stage . Day Close on black and white movie that is being projected . Lila Grant , a blonde actress , is singing and dancing with two male dancers in tuxedos . In the control booth , Forrester and Mignon are joining several sound technicians . The Head Engineer and his assistants are rocking to the performance on the screen beyond their glass booth . They all nod in agreement , Lila has a great production number on film . On the screen Lila favors the camera in every angle , she matches the male dancers with precision , yet Lila knows how to give her all as she works the camera . As this clip ends , the projector rolls to a halt ; the lights come up leaving us wanting more from Lila and the talented twosome on the screen . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( to Forrester ) We 'll need a miracle to save this film . Engineer speaks to projectionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Let 's roll back to number ten , Eddie , one , zero , got that . ( back to Forrester ) We 've got one heck of a problem here . Sound operators lost the sync during the filming , we did n't  --  8  --  know until they tried to put the film together . The film does n't match the sound track . Head Engineer reclines back on his chair . &nbsp; FORRESTER ( puzzled ) We have a picture . Head Engineer nods yes . &nbsp; FORRESTERWe have a music track . Engineer nods again . &nbsp; FORRESTERBut they do n't match ? &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEERCompletely out of sync . Engineer leans forward again and speaks into the stage microphone . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEEROkay , hit it , Eddie . Engineer directs our attention once again to the screen on the re-recording stage . This time Lila is lounging in a plush living room . She should be singing a love song , we hear the words , but as we watch her lips awkwardly moving against rather than with the lyrics , she seems comical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIGNON ( matter-of-factly ) Lila Grant looks like she 's chewing marbles while someone else is singing . &nbsp; FORRESTER ( defensively ) Of course she 's chewing marbles . But the public does n't have to know this , and fellas , we 'd like to keep it this way . ( to Mignon ) This show opens for Christmas at the Music Hall . I 'm counting on you , with the aid of my best technicians , to turn this unfortunate situation into one of the top money makers of the new year . Forrester checks his watch , then , &nbsp; FORRESTEREnough said , I 'm due for a meeting . &nbsp; MIGNONGoodbye , C. J. . . . Everyone sighs with relief after he 's gone , then , &nbsp; MIGNON ( to Head Engineer ) Okay Charlie , what are our options ? &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEERWe can reshoot the love song . &nbsp; MIGNONWe ca n't do that , Lila Grant is presently engaged with the &nbsp; U.S.Oentertaining troops . . . ( looking back at wall clock ) Right about now , Lila is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound assistants are anxiously waiting for the Head Engineer 's next response . This could be a career move . The Head Engineer sips his coffee and considers . One assistant nervously adds , &nbsp; SOUND ASSISTANTYeah , I remember before the war , we must'a seen hundreds of male singers and dancers in shows like this . I liked the colored tap dancers best . . . but they got drafted too . &nbsp; MIGNON ( dryly ) I guess we know why you did n't get drafted . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( almost apologetically ) We have a technique we 'd like to try . Mind you , we have n't perfected . . . &nbsp; MIGNON ( interrupting ) Come on Charlie , if it 's anything that might save us , let 's do it .  --  9  --  &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( still hesitant ) Well , we brought in the gal who did the master tapes . Had her rehearsing a couple of times this morning . . . Engineer pauses long enough to take a slow sip of his coffee . Mignon is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEERWell , we have her sing and try to match the picture with her live voice . ( into microphone ) Ester honey , can you hear me . . . ? Beyond the glass booth , lights come on in the stage area . For the first time we see Ester Jeeter , a young black woman in a baffled area in front of an RCA microphone . Ester is slightly overdressed for the occasion , and carries sheet music . From Ester 's POV we can see Mignon and the technicians inside the glass booth ; she speaks into the RCA , &nbsp; ESTER ( promptly ) Yes sir . She has spoken so quickly that she has to cough to clear her throat . &nbsp; MIGNON ( to sound assistant ) Can we get her something for her throat , something hot to drink ? &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( curtly ) No , we do n't allow food or drink on the stage , or near the equipment . Engineer 's cup of coffee is balancing on the dials of his master control board . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . . . get her something to drink . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( flatly ) Well , do n't blame me if the equipment gets ruined . &nbsp; MIGNON ( curtly ) We wo n't blame you , Charlie . Assistant brings Ester a cup of coffee . Ester smiles at Mignon ; she has overheard everything coming from the control booth . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEER ( into microphone , to Ester ) Okay honey , when I give you the cue . . . we 're gon na start from the top on number ten , the love song , just like we rehearsed it . Each time the Engineer becomes too familiar with Ester and calls her " honey , " we see Mignon flinch with disbelief . &nbsp; HEAD ENGINEERWatch the screen , honey , and listen for the click track . Ester nods , clears her throat , and takes a breath . The studio lights dim once again and the silver screen flashes . Again we see Lila Grant on the screen ; the New York City skyline is behind her . Lila sighs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings her heart out on the darkened stage . It 's Ester 's song , her voice that holds everyone spellbound , but their eyes are glued to Lila on the screen . Mignon watches as the Engineer and his assistants respond to the image of Lila . The new technique seems to be a success ; with the aid of Ester , Lila has come alive again . As far as the technicians are concerned ,  --  10  --  Ester does not exist ; Lila reigns in the breathtaking splendor of this 1940s moment . Mignon becomes so moved by this parallax of injustice , her eyes widen and fill ; as she blinks away the tears , we cut to : Section Details Int : Telephone booth . Day Mignon is smoking a cigarette . On the wall behind her is a sticker reading " I am so an American . " A positive message for people of German descent living in America during the war years . &nbsp; MIGNON ( into telephone ) Hello , hello Fontain . . . ? Of course it 's me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . Yes , everything 's all right , I just wanted to hear your voice . . . No , I 'm afraid I wo n't be coming home for the holidays .

Bye , Mother . Cut to : &nbsp; pp. 12-17 Int : National Studios , front office . Day We find Ester Jeeter sitting on a plush leather couch in front of C. J. Forrester 's office . When Ester thinks the alert Louise is not watching her , she tries to rearrange her seating position , she wants to look sophisticated . We hear the sound of Forrester yelling within his office . &nbsp; LOUISE ( to Ester ) Oh , do n't worry honey . . . ( indicating Forrester 's office ) It 's always like this around here .

Forrester signals to Mignon who has been watching from across the room ; he wants her to take over for him . Section Details Resume front office Ester , overhearing some of their conversation , is becoming increasingly nervous as their negotiations become very loud . Section Details Resume Forrester 's office Mignon has placed herself between Leo Gaines and Forrester ; she mediates . &nbsp; MIGNON ( to Forrester ) Ester Jeeter can not get into the local union , nor has she been able to receive . . .

Forrester balks , interrupting Mignon &nbsp; FORRESTER ( struggling ) Ah , rather than not to find it in one 's heart , . . . ah , we must consider the precedent of this unique situation . . . Mignon is magical as she deftly cuts in and runs the defense for Ester Jeeter without offending or angering Gaines or Forrester . &nbsp; MIGNON ( quickly , to Gaines ) In agreement with Mr. Forrester , this precedent indicates a bonus fee for Ester , commensurate with the local union wages for her special efforts on our behalf . As she leads Leo Gaines to the door , &nbsp; MIGNONSo Mr. Gaines , it appears as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ester 's work . ( a beat , then ) Goodbye , Mr. Gaines . Closing the door behind Gaines , Mignon prepares herself for Forrester . She has made a verbal agreement to pay Ester five times as much as she would have normally been paid so that Ester may have enough to pay her would-be agent his fee and still come out ahead . Mignon has overstepped her authority in a major test of her tacit agreement with Forrester . &nbsp; MIGNON ( calculating ) Our bonus will insure Ester 's availability if we need her again on this project . ( pausing ) There is quite a demand for her talent these days . Forrester begins to nod in agreement as this strategy slowly becomes his own idea . He smiles to himself , then , &nbsp; FORRESTER ( indicating Gaines ) You enjoy those characters , do n't you ? &nbsp; MIGNONQuite the contrary , C.

The real history , the history that most people will remember and believe in , is what they see on the silver screen . ( a few beats , then ) No , I never wanted to be an actress . I thought I could do something here , ( indicating studio ) I wanted to be where history was made . Where it is rewritten on film . Stopping before a huge sound stage , they pause to look inside . &nbsp; MIGNONIt 's like people will always remember and believe that the actor Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like Claudette Colbert . Section Details Resume Forrester 's office Lt. Bedsford is reading Mignon 's mail . He places the photograph of Julius on top of Mignon 's freshly-cut desktop flowers . Section Details Resume Mignon and Ester &nbsp; MIGNON ( continuing ) People make films about themselves . What they want , what they love , what they fear the most . . . here , we 're just props in their stories . Musical props , dancing props , comical relief . ( softly ) There 's nothing here for me anymore . . . I came into this world of moving shadows and I made it work for me . . . but I made what work ? There 's no joy in the seduction of false images . From inside the sound stage , we see Mignon and Ester as two silhouettes , their black images dwarfed by the scale of the stage . Mignon continues V-O.  --  16  --  &nbsp; MIGNON ( V-O ) I 've become an illusion , just like the stories they make here . They think of me one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't know who I am . Dissolve to : Section Details Resume Forrester 's office Mignon walks in and surprises Lt. Bedsford , who is reading the rest of her mail , and sorting through her file . Bedsford moves with the air of a government official taking care of confidential business , when , &nbsp; MIGNON ( curious ) What are you doing here ? Bedsford turns to Mignon triumphantly . Mignon tries to take the files from him , but he roughly pushes her aside . We think that Mignon will strike him in the face again , when , &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORD ( cooing to her ) Well , well . . . you had us all fooled . You had me completely fooled . &nbsp; MIGNON ( flatly ) I 'm not ashamed of who I am , Lieutenant . Mignon replaces her letters and files upon her desk . When she turns to walk away , he grabs her arm , almost twisting it behind her . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORDIf you 're not ashamed of being just as colored as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mignon jerks away violently . Bedsford is caught off guard . &nbsp; MIGNONWhy did n't I what , Lieutenant ? Why did n't I report to you that I was n't a white woman ? Why did n't I warn you not to make such a fool out of yourself . . . or why did n't someone stop me before I got so far ? ( a few beats , then ) Yes , yes , I played the advantage to get what I wanted . . . so what ? Bedsford becomes a physical threat . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORD ( in control now ) Careful , you 're not quite the same woman you were this morning . . . He comes toward her . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORDI can see it now . . . it 's in your eyes . &nbsp; MIGNON ( disgusted ) Do n't waste your time , Lieutenant . He spins her around to face him , tormenting and teasing . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORDDo you think you 've done something important here ? Had some kind of an impact ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing except you ! &nbsp; MIGNON ( struggling in his grip ) What do you fear from me ? Why are you so afraid of me ? I develop musicals , escapist film for a war-weary country . . . ( excitedly ) But you , Lieutenant , you have power and influence behind you . I fear you and I envy you at the same time . You take the public in hand , you guide them , inspire them . . . you show them how every boy can be a hero on the front lines if they go to war and die !  --  17  --  Bedsford laughs with pride and power over Mignon , he pulls her closer . &nbsp; MIGNON ( without faltering ) Well , something here has changed , Lieutenant , and I 'm a big part of it . You know something else ? I want to do what you do . . . I want to do what you do and I tremble with anticipation of it . Mignon slowly moves behind Forrester 's desk , away from the Lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here when my husband was shipped overseas . . . You see , Lieutenant , I never once saw a film showing " my boys " fighting for this country , building this country . . . do you get my point , Lieutenant ? Your scissors and your paste methods have eliminated my history , my participation in this country . . . And the influence of that screen can not be overestimated . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORD ( arrogant and sure ) Look , we all have a job to do . I did n't make this world and I do n't make the rules . Bored with her tirade , he casually takes the photo of Julius and throws it into her face while he is speaking . . . &nbsp; LT . BEDSFORDThere 's always been a top dog and a low dog , that 's just the way it is . After the war . . . things may change , give it time . . . Bedsford retreats to the office bar and pours himself a stiff drink , when &nbsp; MIGNON ( loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't get at home . . . I 'd like to make that movie , Lieutenant ! As Bedsford sips his drink , we pan back to Mignon . &nbsp; MIGNONI thought there was nothing here for me . I wanted to leave this . . . magic carpet we call film . . . ( slowly ) Now I 'm going to stay . I 'll stay right here and I 'll fight because I want to do what you do , Lieutenant . With a quizzical look on his face , Bedsford walks toward Mignon . &nbsp; MIGNONYou fight your war . . . and I 'll fight mine . And , if I have to work shoulder-to-shoulder with you to learn everything you know , then that 's just what I 'll do . . . ( a beat , then ) From now on , Lieutenant , I 'm here for the same reasons you are . Mignon sits in Forrester 's chair as Bedsford tips his glass to her , a mock salute , to challenge her . Mignon does not break her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( V-O ) We would meet again , Ester Jeeter and I . . . for it was she who helped me see beyond the shadows dancing on a white wall . . . to define what I had already come to know , and to take action without fearing . . . Yes ! I wanted to use the power of the motion picture , for there are many stories to be told . . . and many battles to begin . The End pp . NA-11 &nbsp;
