Word had gone out that the memorial service for the 17 victims of a savage election-day attack on a schoolhouse in downtown Port-au-Prince was set for 9 a.m . But when the hour tolled , the Basilica Notre Dame was empty , and churchworkers began locking up the faded pink-and-yellow cathedral . The attendants nervously explained that the service had been canceled " because of rain . " On the steps of the cathedral , a 79-year-old man squinted at the light drizzle . " People are too scared , " he whispered . " It is still too soon . " <P> Less than two weeks after a bloody rampage by soldiers and armed thugs made a farce of the country 's attempt at a democratic transition , the people of Haiti were still in shock . Efforts foundered to forge a united opposition to the three-man provisional government headed by Lieut . General Henri Namphy . The four leading presidential candidates supported calls for general strikes last week , but their goals initially differed . Some aimed to dissolve the government , while others demanded reinstatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By week 's end all four agreed to call on the junta to resign . Meanwhile , many Haitians worried about the adverse financial consequences of a protracted strike . The result : two days of spotty protests that were in stark contrast to last June 's successful strikes , which foiled Namphy 's attempt to wrest control of the country 's voting process from the electoral council . Said a factory worker locked out of his job : " The only way to strike against these people is with arms . " <P> The failure of the general strike seemed to embolden the army-dominated government . Since the election cancellation , the junta has paraded a stream of Duvalierists before television cameras to denounce the electoral council and American interference . More to the point , the government-owned TV station has repeatedly flashed a message across the screen : I WILL ONLY SURRENDER THIS TOWN WHEN IT IS REDUCED TO ASHES , AND WHEN IT IS REDUCED TO ASHES , I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT . The quote is well known , the pledge of an early 19th century Haitian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the history lesson to be a warning that Namphy 's junta would keep attempting to ensure its own survival . Said a Haitian businessman : " No one doubts now that the military is prepared to go to any extreme to retain power . " <P> According to a former Haitian army officer who now lives in Miami , the real strongman is not Namphy , but Colonel Jean-Claude Paul , commander of an infantry battalion that includes more than 700 soldiers and armed civilians . The officer claims that without Paul 's cooperation , military and paramilitary forces could not have aborted the balloting . Paul is known to have a close working relationship with Claude Raymond , a former general whose presidential campaign was crushed when the electoral council disqualified twelve candidates , citing the new constitution 's widely popular ten-year ban on Duvalierists seeking public office . <P> Still , Namphy can not be absolved of responsibility for the election-day carnage . Haitian sources say that at 1:20 a.m. , just hours before the polls opened , Namphy drove in a convoy to the National Palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who claims to have witnessed the convoy : " He was in on the planning and execution of the entire scenario . "
