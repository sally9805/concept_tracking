The two , and an assortment of other guests , were on a boat off Victoria , 70 miles south of here . Dr. Biggs was telling the Prince about the ' ' K1 Pod ' ' of killer whales that inhabit Haro Strait. // At that moment , a number of whales appeared . Biggs , who knows by sight each of the 300 or so killer whales that roam the waters off British Columbia and Washington State , was able to identify individuals in the pod for the Duke of Edinburgh . One whale , right before them , ate a fish - its usual food . Another rolled over and displayed its entire body , perhaps 25 feet long . Boat and whales traveled together through the water for 20 minutes . The Prince snapped away with a tiny camera. // // Biggs heads a group studying marine mammals at the Pacific Biological Station here , a research facility belonging to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. // Concerned about the netting of whales to capture them live for aquariums , the group enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whales , starting in 1971 . Questionnaires were sent to lighthouses , ferries , fishery patrol boats , tugs , fishermen , and others who lived and worked along the coast of British Columbia . After three such censuses , the number of whales estimated was 200 to 350 , much lower than had been thought. // Over time , the process of whale identification was refined . Biggs and his colleagues spent thousands of hours watching the creatures in the ocean . They were able to put together a genealogy for the majority of the whales of the coast , which they call ' ' residents. ' ' // ' ' There isn ' t any other study of marine animals where it is possible to do the lineages , ' ' Biggs said. // He and three other scientists ( Graeme M. Ellis , John K. B. Ford , and Kenneth C. Balcomb ) have just written a book , ' ' Killer Whales ' ' ( Phantom Press &; Publishers Inc . , Nanaimo , British Columbia ) . Half the book consists of photographs of the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the whales in the area . Each animal can be identified by the unique shape , size , and scars of the fin , and the shape and pigmentation details of the saddle patch behind the fin. // Biggs and his colleagues found that there are two races of killer whales : residents and transients. // The residents are more numerous , living in two ' ' communities . ' ' The range of the northern community , composed of 16 pods with a total of 172 whales , extends from about mid-Vancouver Island north to the southeastern tip of Alaska . The southern community , with three pods and 81 whales , ranges from the southern edge of the northern community into Puget Sound , around southern Vancouver Island , and down the west coast of Washington State to about Grays Harbor. // Resident whales feed on fish and squid . Apparently their large pods give them a better chance of locating and corralling their food . Swimming as a group , they cover a wider territory and are more likely to run across a school of fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocalizations , ' ' the pod can surround the school in a way that gives them a better chance of catching more fish . In summer and fall , the whales are often found in inshore waters , where salmon congregate before moving upstream to spawn. // Biggs dubs the other race transients because they are more rare , and their movements are far less predictable . These whales normally eat other sea mammals - seals , sea lions , porpoises , and baleen whales. // Transients hunt alone or in small pods , poking into small bays , traveling in near-silence , perhaps so as not to warn prey of their presence . Unlike sharks , killer whales are cautious hunters , sometimes spending hours harassing a 1 , 000-pound sea lion until the tusk-bearing creature is so tired it can be drowned safely . These transients will dive for five to 10 minutes , while the residents tend to stay down only a few minutes or less. // ' ' They pose virtually no danger to humans , ' ' says Biggs . They are considered benevolent to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this coast for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. // Biggs has never seen any sign of aggression during his many hours in a boat among the whales . ' ' They are extremely tolerant animals , ' ' he says. // The two races apparently do not mate . Neither do they travel together or show any signs of aggression toward each other . Referring to their different feeding habits , travel patterns , pod sizes , and vocalizations , Biggs speaks of ' ' cultural ' ' differences . Further , the physical appearance of the dorsal fin often differs in the two races. // Among other findings about killer whales : // *They live in a matriarchal society . In the case of resident whales , children of all ages generally travel close to their mothers throughout their lives . One pod of resident whales may include a grandmother , her daughters and sons , and her grandchildren . It is this characteristic that enabled Biggs and his colleagues to develop almost complete genealogies for the resident whales . Unlike residents , some transient whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to draw up only limited genealogies for the transients. // *The life span of these whales is similar to that of human beings . Females live 70 or 80 years , and males 50 or 60 years . Females start to bear calves in their mid-teens . These newborns are about eight feet long and weigh about 400 pounds . A typical female will bear four to six offspring over a 25-year period and then stop breeding . They give birth mainly in fall and winter , though births can occur at any time of year . Males reach a maximum of about 32 feet long and 10 to 11 tons ; females , 28 feet and 7 to 8 tons . Adult males can be distinguished by their tall dorsal fins , which can reach 5 feet . Female dorsal fins reach only about 3 feet. // *Both resident and transient killer whales produce two types of underwater vocalization . One consists of a series of as many as several hundred brief , high-energy clicks per second . These are probably for echolocation , helping the whale to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , consists of ' ' whistles , variable calls , and discrete calls . ' ' Whistles and variable calls seem to be used when whales are socializing in a tightly knit group. // Killer whales have been protected in British Columbia since 1970 . ' ' People still shoot them , though , ' ' laments Biggs . Netting of killer whales to catch them for aquariums stopped in the mid-1970s in British Columbia and Washington State because of public opposition . That combined protection has enabled the west coast population to grow at a rate of about 2 percent a year. // That pleases Biggs . ' ' These are magnificent animals , ' ' he says. // // //
