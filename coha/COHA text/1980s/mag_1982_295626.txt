Voters ' Choice <P> To the Editors : <P> The recent elections Nov. 15 were not a referendum on Reaganomics or the President , but a determination that our system is better served by a balance of parties in office . The President will undoubtedly have to compromise , but not to the point of shedding his ideals or basic philosophy . <P> Peter Verniero <P> Durham , N.C. <P> The message is clear : Ronald Reagan should go home in 1984 , and start packing his bags now . <P> Gabriel Sucker <P> Washington , D.C. <P> Considering the disastrous state of the economy , the Republicans have every right to be pleased with the election results . Voters still do n't see a believable Democratic alternative to Reaganomics . The White House is up for grabs by the first person to offer a credible solution to America 's economic mess . <P> Yale M. Zussman <P> Allston , Mass . <P> The multimillion-dollar election was a disaster for the American people and a boon to television . Most of this money was spent to produce worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures , it should start by cutting campaign financing , an area that can well afford it . <P> Max Dennis <P> Williston , Fla . <P> I am a California voter . This November I had to elect a Senator , a Congressman , a Governor , a superintendent of schools and several other state officers . I had to decide on more than two dozen propositions as well as innumerable judges and local officials . All told , I had to make at least 50 elective decisions , of which I was intelligently informed on no more than 30 . This may be blasphemy , but the political process is woefully underfinanced ; $300 million is not even $1.50 per person spent on a biennial national election . Let 's not confuse the total amount spent on the campaign with the quality of information needed to educate the public . <P> Michael Garcia <P> Hayward , Calif . <P> President Reagan 's swipe at the nuclear-freeze movement is bogus . This group is as much the product of Soviet agents as the Polish Solidarity union is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Reagan declared that the nuclear-arms freeze won in several states because foreign agents worked hard for it . Were 10.8 million out of 18 million Americans who voted on the issue fooled by this evil group , or is the President trying to discredit those who voted their conscience ? <P> James R. Me Williams <P> Glendale , Calif . <P> Winning Friends <P> By voting against Britain on the U.N . resolution concerning the Falkland Islands Nov. 15 , the U.S. has turned its back on its closest ally . We have done this in the hope of gaining friends in one of the most unstable areas of the world . The success we will achieve in Latin America with this vote is temporary ; the support of the British will be lasting . <P> Tom Nugent <P> Ames , Iowa <P> It is unbelievable that you should call America 's vote against Britain on the Falkland Islands dispute embarrassing . In the past decade our allies have voiced opposition to many U.S. proposals . Britain was one of the first to object to the U.S. embargo on pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. voted for its self-interest . <P> David W. Pinters <P> Plymouth , Mich . <P> Niebuhr as Mentor
