A lawsuit asks for $14 million <P> Late in March 1981 , JoAnn Hinckley drove her son John to the Denver airport and told him not to come home again . A few days later , John Hinckley shot and wounded President Reagan , along with Presidential Press Secretary James Brady , Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. Police Officer Thomas Delahanty . At the trial last May , Mrs. Hinckley said she threw her son out as part of a plan devised by John 's psychiatrist , John Hopper Jr. , to force him to be less dependent on his parents . Hopper testified that he did not consider his young patient mentally ill and never thought there was much " cause for concern . " <P> Last week Brady , McCarthy and Delahanty joined in a $14 million suit against Hopper . Filed in U.S. District Court in Denver , it contends that the psychiatrist misdiagnosed Hinckley as having only minor problems and rejected his parents ' suggestions that he be institutionalized . They had a dozen sessions in his Evergreen , Colo. , office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The suit charges that the doctor failed to warn police of " the reasonable likelihood that Hinckley would attempt a political assassination , " despite Hinckley 's admission that his " mind was on the breaking point . " Hinckley , judged innocent by reason of insanity , is confined at a federal mental hospital in Washington . <P> Paul Smith , a lawyer for the American Psychiatric Association , said that there is a precedent of sorts for such a lawsuit . The Supreme Court of California has held that a psychiatrist can be held liable for the actions of patients where a specific threat could be identified . Says Smith : " A jury would decide whether or not a reasonable psychiatrist would have done more to protect society than this guy did . "
