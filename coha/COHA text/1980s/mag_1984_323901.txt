Looming deadlines , adamantine editors , late-breaking events : <P> What journalist coping with the pressures of the news does not occasionally wax nostalgic for what is remembered as the relaxed life of academe ? By next spring 30 TIME staff members will have briefly sampled college life again under the auspices of the TlME-Duke University Fellowship program . Each year since 1979 , six TIME journalists have traveled to Durham , N.C. , for a four-week sabbatical , attending classes and undertaking research projects . In return , they are invited to share their knowledge , experience and perspective with students and faculty members in informal meetings . Says Bill Green , Duke 's director of university relations : " It is a two-way exchange : the fellows ' programs are as varied as the fellows , and the students and faculty get the stimulation of journalism , with all its urgencies and importunities , within the classroom . " <P> One TlME-Duke fellow , former Senior Editor James D. Atwater , found academic life so rewarding that he has now made it his full-time occupation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a correspondent and writer , then went to the Saturday Evening Post in 1962 . In 1969 he worked on drug-education programs for the U.S. Government , and later roved Europe as a writer for Reader 's Digest . Rejoining TIME in 1973 , he eventually edited the Nation , World and Education sections . Then last fall Atwater assumed a different kind of editorial post : dean of the University of Missouri 's 75-year-old school of journalism , the oldest and one of the most prestigious of such institutions . <P> Atwater sees his school as a training ground for a new generation of journalists , preparing for an increasingly challenging profession . Missouri combines a strong academic program with practical training , including work on a university TV station and on the Columbia Missourian , a small-city newspaper ( circ. 6,500 ) put out by the journalism school . " The Missourian is a competitive commercial daily , " says Atwater , " and we do all the local news programming for the station . " More important , he says , " we give students a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technically complex stories have become contentious community issues and the press is often regarded with skepticism . " Atwater does not look upon his new post as a refuge from the real world . Says he : " I 'm not meeting deadlines now , but the pressures are no less-just different . "
