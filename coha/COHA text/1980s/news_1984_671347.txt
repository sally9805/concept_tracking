A majority of the justices said the evidence justified conviction if considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution . But the court ruled some of the evidence had been tainted by lack of a search warrant and should not have been admitted. // Furthermore , the court said evidence that might have been helpful to the defense had been improperly supressed by the trial judge. // Reacting calmly to the decision , Mr. von B " ulow said in an interview in New York City that he would not necessarily object if prosecutors sought a new trial , although he said he was reluctant to subject himself to another such ordeal . " I obviously want to be vindicated , and I feel that our new evidence would vindicate me completely at a new trial , " he said . ( Page 7. ) // // // Evidence Available for Case // // The effect of the ruling is that in a new trial the prosecution would be left without a state laboratory ' s analyses of pills and capsules that Mr. von B " ulow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunny ) von B " ulow , at her mansion in Newport . It would still have available the testimony of its witnesses , as well as the tests showing residues of insulin , a tranquilizer and an anesthetic on the hypodermic needle that it said was used to inject her. // But it would also have to contend with the notes of interviews that a private attorney had with members of Mrs. von B " ulow ' s family when they first sought help in investigating her illness . She has remained in an insulin-induced coma , with no perceptible brain function , since December 1980 . Mr. von B " ulow has been free on $1 million bail , living in his wife ' s apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. // " Now that a lot of the evidence has been found illegal , " said Alan M. Dershowitz , the Harvard Law School professor who argued the von B " ulow appeal , " we think the house of cards crumbles and there isn ' t enough evidence to bring a new trial.

Roberts 2d , Rhode Island ' s Attorney General , said he would petition the State Supreme Court to reconsider its opinion but that he had not yet decided whether to seek a new trial . " Immediately , we will be deciding , " he said . Stephen R. Famiglietti , who prosecuted the case as an Assistant Attorney General and who is now in private practice here in Providence , expressed his disappointment. // " We spent so much time , more than a year in the preparation and actual trial of the case , not to mention the time spent on appeal , " he said . " Naturally , it ' s frustrating. " // Richard Kuh , the former Manhattan District Attorney hired by Mrs. von B " ulow ' s family to investigate the case , voiced a similar sentiment .

" The search of the Newport mansion and specifically of Mr. von B " ulow ' s bedroom and closet by his stepson and a private detective was permissible , the court found , citing its ruling in a prior case , " because the constitutional prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures applies only to governmental conduct . " <> <> No Warrant Was Obtained // // The private laboratory tests conducted from the needles and drugs discovered in a black bag found in the closet were admissible , the court ruled. // But when those objects passed into the hands of the public authorities in Rhode Island , the justices wrote , the search warrant was required under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Rhode Island Constitution. // Without such a warrant ' s being obtained by the state police , a state toxicologist analyzed the chemistry of five samples of pills and two samples of ampules. // Those findings were important , the justices wrote , because not only " did the circumstantial evidence suggest that defendant had injected his wife with insulin by means of a hypodermic needle , but it also implied that defendant may have anesthetized her prior to such an injection . " <> <> State Has Stricter Rule // // Thus , they said , " the presence of the tranquilizing and anesthetic drugs in the black bag and their positive identification by the state toxicologist firmly tightened the web of circumstantial evidence around which the state had woven its case against defendant. " // But the Rhode Island Constitution , which sets a stricter standard than the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution , the justices said , permits no exceptions to the need for a search warrant. // " The state may not significantly expand the scope of a private search unless it obtains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search was basis for overturning the convictions. // The court also ruled that , while Mr. Kuh ' s role in the case was proper , the giving of some of his information to the prosecution and the withholding of the rest of it from the defense was improper. // The state could not have it both ways , the court said , and by sharing part of his information , Mr. Kuh had invalidated his claim to the protective privilege accorded a lawyer ' s own notes and other work product . <> <> Selective Disclosure Criticized // // From the outset , the justices wrote , " Kuh and his clients , by choice , selectively disclosed information sufficient to help the state build its case against defendant while relying on one privilege or the other to prevent the flow of potentially relevant evidence to defendant . " Some of that evidence , the justices said , " may have been vital to his defense. " // Professor Dershowitz applauded the court ' s ruling against such activity . " Mr. Kuh saw his duty , and saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' case and withholding what would not help his clients ' case , " he said from New York today. // " Police work has to be left to the police , " he continued . " The big lesson is that you can ' t have it both ways . You can ' t try to circumvent constitutional constraints by having private investigators do the work for you . This end run around the Constitution didn ' t work . I think that ' s the lesson. " // Four of the five justices , however , made it clear they felt that the evidence used at the trial supported a jury ' s conclusion that Mr. von B " ulow had tried to murder his wife in order to marry a lover who had insisted on marriage . <> <> Federal Ruling Discounted // // Disagreeing with their own chief justice , who wrote in a separate opinion that the trial judge should have granted an acquittal on the first count of attempted murder , they said : " The reasonable inferences drawn from such evidence support a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ultimatum of his intended bride , decided to take matters into his own hands , one of which held a syringe containing a copious quantity of insulin , and so injected the contents of the syringe into his wife with the intent that she should expire so that he would be free to marry Alexandra. " // The court also said a recent United States Supreme Court ruling did not apply in this case . In that case , U.S. v. Jacobsen , the Court approved a police field search for contraband conducted in response to a private invitation. // The drugs found in the black bag did not appear to be contraband , they said , and were tested on two separate occasions . The case " does not involve a field test at all , " they said. // " The chemical testing that defendant here challenges occurred , not in the field following a lawful private search , but rather in the state toxicology laboratory some one and six weeks after its delivery to the State Police , " the justices said. // //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
