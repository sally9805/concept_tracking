The latter hurt more than the former , but both teams have had time to recover from the impact and should be ready to start again when the season opens tonight at the Meadowlands against Atlanta. // The Nets have a new coach , Stan Albeck , who , before winning a single game , has literally produced a feature film entitled " The Worst Fouls of Darryl Dawkins . " Perhaps learning from the evidence , Dawkins and his teammates will be home against Atlanta tonight while the Knicks travel to Cleveland before opening at home against Washington tomorrow. // The main objective is to qualify for the playoffs , which have been expanded to 16 of the 23 teams in the National Basketball Association . To fail to qualify for such a huge field is to invite professional embarrassment after both the Knicks and Nets qualified last year . But there are no guarantees. // The Knicks will be trying to advance under Hubie Brown , the coach who brought in his highly patterned , defensive-oriented program last year . Brown , who depends on total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical clearance to resume coaching after an angina attack last week. // // The Nets have a new coach , Albeck , and a new executive vice president and chief operating officer , Lewis Schaffel . Their first task is to lighten the depressed mood induced when Larry Brown traipsed down the yellow brick road to the University of Kansas just when the Nets were preparing for the playoffs. // That was a stunning blow to the young Nets , who lost two straight to the Knicks in the brief first round . The way last season ended made stability a major priority for the Nets this season . The first step was to hire Schaffel , a former players ' agent who had served terms as a general manager in New Orleans and Atlanta. // For the past three years , Schaffel // had been working in private business in New York but had kept his contacts with pro basketball . He had an idea of what was needed to change the mood in the Meadowlands. // Schaffel and Albeck first met while Albeck was an assistant coach for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1970 ' s and Schaffel was representing a player. // " It was a memorable beginning , " Schaffel recalls . " Stan met me at the airport in a limousine and I was very impressed . Thirty feet outside the airport , it broke down. " // // When Schaffel asked Albeck to come to New Jersey to discuss the Nets ' job last spring , he didn ' t send a limousine but rather an assistant with an ordinary private car . With no vehicle breakdowns , Schaffel eventually put himself into position to sign the 52-year-old coach , who has a 190- 138 record in the N.B.A. // " After that experience with Larry Brown , the team needed somebody who has won , who has experience in the N.B.A. and who could give a sense of direction to the young players , " Schaffel said . " The thing with Larry could have been a problem , but with Stan , it hasn ' t been. " // Schaffel says Albeck was his first choice because " he has a unique personality . He ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in discipline but he also knows when to let things flow , something I find is missing in the N.B.A. Most coaches tend to see it as ' My way or the highway. ' " // The mid-winter marathon of weird travel arrangements and one-night stands and the difficulty of imposing any kind of coaching on squads of former all-America gunners tends to boil the sense of humor out of N.B.A. coaches . But Schaffel says Albeck manages to remain a human being. // " He is not an elitist , " Schaffel says . " He is always open to opinions . He talks to everybody in the office . He goes to lunch with anybody - a couple of ticket salesmen , the secretaries , whoever ' s around . He ' s in the office every single day , communicating with people. " // Building a sense of community is important for the Nets , who play in the swamplands of New Jersey and have yet to develop much identity in the New York region . Schaffel says : " That type of unifying factor is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coaching . A graduate of Bradley University , he has coached at Adrian College in Michigan , Northern Michigan University and the University of Denver . He gained a good reputation as an assistant at professional teams in Denver , San Diego , Kentucky ( under Hubie Brown ) and Los Angeles before receiving his first head-coaching job , with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1979. // Schaffel says he was always " particularly impressed with Stan ' s work with his centers . He had enormous success in revitalizing centers. " // " He won 37 games at Cleveland with Dave Robisch . He won 52 games at San Antonio with George Johnson and Paul Griffin . He won 48 with Dave Corzine and George Johnson . And he won 52 last year with a revitalized Artis Gilmore , who had been moribund for several years at Chicago. " // The Nets fit right into that pattern . Schaffel admits " it sounds like an old record to say that Darryl Dawkins and Mike Gminski have not reached their potenial , whatever it is . After a while , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before throwing away the record , Albeck made a feature film , incorporating the worst fouls Dawkins committed last year when he set the league record for personals with 379 . In surpassing the record of 372 , set by Steve Johnson of Kansas City the year before , Dawkins was often in foul trouble while the national anthem was still echoing in the rafters. // " It ' s not a matter of memory , " Schaffel says . " It ' s a matter of demonstrating . Stan wants to show Darryl , ' This is the way you move your body , this is the way you reach your hand in , this is what you do . ' And Darryl has worked hard . Stan ' s got him playing closer to the basket . He wants Darryl dunking any time he can. " // Somebody says " with that physique. . . " and Schaffel sighs and says " I know , I know . " It is indeed an old record . Albeck is going to try for a stereo effect at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Twin Towers. // " If I can get 20 to 25 points plus 15 rebounds from them , " the coach said , " I ' ll be getting as solid a performance out of my center as anyone in the league. " // Can Albeck unite the Nets after their reeling finish last year ? He has already won some friends in the Nets ' office with his open ways , and maybe that ' s a sign. // //
