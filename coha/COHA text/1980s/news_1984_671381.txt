WHEN John Neville enters as Don Adriano de Armado in " Love ' s Labor ' s Lost " at this season ' s Stratford Festival , Canada , it is a magical moment . He looks like a rare treasure that has been carefully unwrapped to protect its brittleness . An ancient , white-haired relic of courtly Old World manners , he is a real idealist in a nouveau recherche world , Don Adriano transformed into Don Quixote . The maid Jacquenetta is his Dulcinea. // At his side is the page , Moth , offering sage advice and lyric song - a beautifully complementary performance by Torquil Campbell , at 12 the youngest of three acting Campbells onstage in Michael Langham ' s production . His father , Douglas Campbell , is the clown , Costard , and his half-brother , Benedict , is the King of Navarre . If it is possible to say this about someone so young , Torquil Campbell is a natural actor - articulate and with a stage presence that belies his years . Torquil is , in the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Mr. Neville are not on stage in this Belle Epoque production , the performances are sometimes labored , especially as the four horsemen of sworn celibacy attempt to break their vows and pursue the Princess of France and her entourage . The production does not have the buoyancy of Mr. Langham ' s Juilliard School version two seasons ago. // As with other plays in the current Stratford repertory , favor is won more by individual actors than by any strong directorial concept . None of the three productions on the main Festival stage - " Love ' s Labor ' s Lost , " " A Midsummer Night ' s Dream " and " Romeo and Juliet " - or " Waiting for Godot " on the smaller Third Stage - is entirely commendable , but each offers , as Costard would say , remuneration. // In " Love ' s Labor ' s Lost , " next to the John Neville-Torquil Campbell team is Douglas Campbell , himself , as a bumptious fool and earthy contrast to the effete Don Armado . When he takes Moth aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what a joyful father wouldest thou make me , " the real-life relationship enhances the moment for the audience. // // With the second stage at the Avon Theater concentrating on Gilbert and Sullivan , and a total of 13 plays ( by Tennessee Williams and Terence Rattigan as well as Shakespeare ) scheduled for the summer season , Stratford visitors have a wide range of dramatic and musical options . The faithful will , of course , buy tickets to see Brian Bedford , who has earned the position as favorite son in roles as varied as Malvolio and Richard III. // This transplanted Englishman was first seen in New York in the late 1950 ' s in boyish roles - he was the acute juvenal of **28;1164; his <> time - and was almost instantly transformed into a character man . In subsequent years at Stratford and on tour of the United States , but too rarely in New York , he has shown his comic virtuosity in Shakespeare and Moli ere . This season at Stratford , he adds Samuel Beckett to his laurels ( in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Playing Vladimir in " Waiting for Godot , " a tramp with shreds of dignity , he climbs on top of Pozzo ' s traveling basket and uses it as a soapbox for oratory that mocks Hamlet as well as himself . " What are we doing here , that is the question , " he wonders . The perpetual answer in the play is , of course , waiting for Godot . Among other things , Mr. Bedford and his colleague , Edward Atienza , as Estragon , both fine actors , show us the affinity that Beckett can have for a pair of scrofulous Shakespearean clowns. // As the two banter in the Beckettian void , we hear whispers of Falstaff and Touchstone , even of Lear and his Fool , with wisdom masquerading as tomfoolery . They are also vaudeville veterans exchanging burlesque badinage . The actors ' distinction is that they savor every scent of language , certifying that Beckett is a welcome guest in Shakespearean company. // Aside from their performances , the Stratford " Godot " is waiting for direction . Joseph Chaikin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsals began , and his replacement , Leon Rubin , has been unable to provide cohesion . The set design by Jun Maeda unnecessarily burdens the prescribed spareness ( a tree , a road ) with a thicket of gnarled branches and a rising ( or setting ) Oriental sun . The Pozzo and Lucky of Andreas Katsulas and Paul Zimet appear to be natives of a different theatrical planet . The former is not imperious enough , the latter , though a good mime , misjudges Lucky ' s harangue . Mr. Bedford and Mr. Atienza are also allied as mechanicals in " A Midsummer Night ' s Dream , " as staged by John Hirsch , the Festival ' s artistic director . While Mr. Atienza is limited to a few nervous , amusing gestures as the desiccated tailor , Starveling , Mr. Bedford is a full-bodied Bottom , an inveterate scene-stealer - without encouragement he will play every role from Moon to Wall . The very professional actor behind that artful impersonation is delightfully expressive even when his features are hidden by an ass ' s head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cock an eye or to tune his voice , a many-timbred instrument. // // Of the Shakespearean productions , Peter Dews ' s " Romeo and Juliet " has the most equipoise . In the title roles , Colm Feore and Seana McKenna are evenly matched as well as extremely youthful , the Montagues and Capulets are appropriately combative and , as superintended by Lewis Gordon playing a stalwart Friar Laurence , the play follows its prescribed course to tragedy . However , the Nurse has been coarsened , Mercutio underscores every innuendo and Juliet has a singsong habit of referring to her love as " Romayo . " There are no performances of the stature of a Neville , Campbell , Bedford or Atienza , as in the Festival ' s other productions. // It is difficult to watch Stratford ' s current " Romeo and Juliet " without recalling fondly the exuberant interpretation inserted into " Nicholas Nickleby . " When the apothecary asks , " Who calls so loud ? " we remember the tremulous voice of David Threlfall ' s Smike , and at the denouement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all but Tybalt to rise in a blissfully revisionist happy ending. //
