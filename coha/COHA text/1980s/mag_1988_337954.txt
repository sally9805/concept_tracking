Just before 82-year-old Sigmund Freud was allowed to leave German-occupied Austria in 1938 , the SS insisted he sign a statement claiming he had been treated well . He complied with a flourish : " I can most highly recommend the Gestapo to everyone . " This defiant and , under the circumstances , risky display of contempt was typical of the man who invented psychoanalysis . Throughout his life , Freud sought to maintain control . In his final hours , suffering through the last stages of throat cancer in 1939 , he told the physician who had accompanied him to England to " make an end of it . " The doctor obediently administered enough morphine to induce a coma from which the patient never awakened . <P> Freud 's urge to preside is evident throughout Peter Gay 's admiring , though hardly reverential biography . Yale 's Sterling Professor of History and author of The Enlightenment and The Bourgeois Experience is a graduate of the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis . Yet if he is a doctrinaire Freudian , he does not show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the product of a culture and period as well as of his upbringing . Yes , he had a beautiful , strong-minded mother whom he once saw naked , or , as he put it , matrem nudam . But he was also a Jew in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at a time of ferment in the arts and sciences . Gay 's Freud emerges slowly but heroically from this background as an ambitious outsider driven by what the author calls a " greed for knowledge " and a scarcely suppressed desire to conquer the exclusive Gentile world . <P> Freud the boy identified himself with Hannibal of Carthage . Freud the founder of the new " mind science " continually sought to assert his authority over associates , nearly all of them Jews . His colleagues appear to have been a touchy lot . Minor disputes frequently ended in nasty breakups and castings- out . But Freud 's greatest distress came in dealing with Carl Jung , the son of a Swiss pastor , whose differences with his Viennese teacher had origins in the varying perspectives of Christianity and Judaism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainted . <P> At home Freud was the image of the stalwart , bourgeois paterfamilias . His household , including wife , six children , sister-in-law and a Chow named Jo-Fi , revolved around his activities . The man who stunned the world with his theories about human behavior adhered to a thoroughly conventional routine , as Gay describes it : <P> " Up by seven , he would see psychoanalytic patients from eight to twelve . Dinner was punctually at one : at the stroke of the clock , the household assembled around the dining-room table ; Freud appeared from his study , his wife sat down facing him at the other end , and the maid materialized , bearing the soup tureen . Then came a walk to restore the circulation , perhaps to deliver proofs or buy cigars . Consultations were at three , and after that , he saw more analytic patients , often until nine in the evening . Then came supper , sometimes a short game of cards with his sister-in-law Minna , or a walk with his wife or one of his daughters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the papers or , in the summer , eat an ice .
