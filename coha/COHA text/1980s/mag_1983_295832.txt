THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF NICHOLAS NICKLEBY Mobil Showcase Network , Jan. 10-13 <P> The tragedienne Mrs. Crummies , great of girth and spirit , explains to Nicholas why she had to give up her title role in The Blood Drinker : " The audiences , sir , " she sighs and smiles , " they could not stand it . It was too ... tremendous ! " <P> Modern audiences had no such difficulty with the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production of The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby . In London in 1980 and a year later on Broadway , David Edgar 's 8hour adaptation of the Dickens novel met with a rapturous reception . In a time when many serious playwrights are hell-bent on reducing life 's dilemmas to their sparest parts , panhandling for quiddity , Edgar and Directors Trevor Nunn and John Caird served up a copious celebration of life in all its wickedness and wonder . Led by Roger Rees as the callow , rigorous hero , 39 R.S.C. actors played 150 parts ; they set the scene and moved the scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere in this complex living organism a sense of theatrical community was affirmed , with a dazzling display of stagecraft that never relaxed its grip on the intelligent heart . <P> In summer 1981 , just before embarking for the U.S. , the Nickleby company faced a new challenge : how to transfer its achievement , on tape , to TV . Would the production be " too ... tremendous " to fit into the home screen ? Ideally , actors would have crept out of the TV frame , perched on top of the console , strolled across the living-room rug to shake out the viewer 's passive complacencies . Practically , TV Producer Colin Callender and Director Jim Goddard had two options . They could create a new production for television , with naturalistic sets and discrete scenes , thus reducing the grand babble to Masterpiece Theater whispers . Or they could allow the actors to trace their familiar patterns , asprawl on the big stage , and catch as catch can . They chose the latter , and it was a wise choice ; now this epochal production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 125,000 or so theatergoers lucky enough to have seen it . <P> It may , however , be initially confusing to millions of Nickleby novices . As host for the four-night series , Peter Ustinov provides helpful plot synopses and snippets of historical background , but he leaves some important unanswered questions for home viewers . Why are most of the actors doubling and tripling their roles ? Why are characters breaking off a scene to describe their actions in the imperious third person ? Why , when two characters are supposedly alone in a room , are other actors standing around watching them ? Why , if this is television , does the camera occasionally cut to a theater audience cheering the performers-even , on two occasions , giving them perfunctory standing ovations ? And why , if it is the record of a theatrical experience , does the director make use of such video effects as rapid cutting and multiple exposure ? All these are conventions , of stage or small screen , to which the viewer must and can accommodate himself .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
