He had looked like a cartoonist ' s conception of a hockey player . Black sweatshirt and pants . Small white plastic protective covering protrudingfrom the elbows and the knees and the skates . He was the kid whose father couldn ' t decide whether he wanted his progeny to be a center or a forward , so he had split the difference , creating a hybrid hockey player . Attired in this warehouse-clearance outfit , Pete Peeters had been skating leisurely during off-day practices for the past week . His job is stopping pucks , but at these casual sessions he was shooting them , zeroing in on backup Marco Baron , fulfilling every goalie ' s alter-ego fantasy , announcing with pride at the end of the workout that he ' d managed to hit the post a couple of times . " I ' d come to the rink and do my stretching exercises , " said Peeters . " Then I ' d go out just to socialize with the guys . It helped pass the time . There was no sense in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I never will be . I knew I was going to see enough rubber in the playoffs as it was . " Last night Peeters saw more rubber than Goodyear . And he rejected more of it than a government safety inspector . That ' s the reason the Bruins are headed into the Stanley Cup playoff quarterfinals instead of into playoff purgatory . The Quebec Nordiques fired everything at him except one of the cannons in the pre-Revolutionary military installations bordering this old fortress city . There were 39 shots in all , and few of them were excuse-me efforts . The Nordiques unloaded from the crease , from the slot , from point blank , from scrambles that resembled the stock exchange at closing time . And Peeters stopped 38 of them , inspiring the Bruins to a 2-1 victory that wrapped up this best-of-five first-round series one game from the limit . Of course , superior goaltending from Peeters has come to be a given , and the tendency is to take him for granted . He has emerged as the best goalie and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bruins to first place overall during the regular season . After a three-goal lapse in the first period of this series , he simply closed the crease to the Brothers Stastny and Co. , permitting Quebec only five goals the rest of the way . As coach Gerry Cheevers said before Game 4 , Peeters is such a reserved , private person and he does his job with such subtle efficiency that he can be overlooked . But you couldn ' t ignore him last night unless you were on a retreat in Tibet . In a season of performances that have been strung together like a diamond necklace , this was the crown jewel . And afterwards , the testimonials poured in . " That was one of the best goaltending performances I ' ve ever seen , " said Cheevers , who has both witnessed and starrred in a few . " Our goalie won us the game . It was as simple as that . We didn ' t play well . A blind man selling pencils could see that . He won it for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach Michel Bergeron . " He had a great year during the season and he just played the same way in the playoffs . " " He was unbelievable , just awesome , " said senior Bruin defenseman Brad Park . " I don ' t even want to touch him in case I change his luck . It was one of the greatest games I ' ve ever seen . I ' ve seen goalies have good nights , but he was exceptional . " " He was fabulous , " said Boston defenseman Mike O ' Connell . " He didn ' t get flustered . He never gets flustered . " The subject of the hosannahs reacted as he reacts to all his performances . Yeah , pretty good game , no big deal : " It was nice to come up with one of my better games at this point of the season . " One of your better ones or your best ? he was asked . " It was nice to have a big game in an important game , " he said . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saluting himself .
