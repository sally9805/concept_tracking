THE CHANGELING Directed by Peter Medak Screenplay by William Gray and Diana Maddox <P> For reasons known only to the sort of people who concoct movies like this one , a middle-aged man ( George C. Scott ) , shattered by the sudden loss of wife and child in an accident , decides that the very place to reconstruct his life is an ancient and gloomy mansion . Of course , the minute he starts to rattle around in this real estate agent 's nightmare , it starts rattling back at him - also creaking and thumping . Obviously , it is trying to tell him something - and not just that there is a little ranch house , a steal at the price , available down the road . Does our hero quickly throw a change of socks and underwear into a bag and take off for the nearest Holiday Inn to think things out ? Not a bit of it . He is always grabbing a flashlight and poking around in the upstairs closets - usually in the wee hours of windy nights . <P> Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child was murdered in the mansion long ago . In due course , the spirit of the dead child is set to rest , the old house comes tumbling down , and Scott can presumably settle down with the rather prissy lady ( Trish Van Devere ) who talked him into the leasehold in the first place . <P> There are a couple of amusing scares , mostly of the " do n't open that door " variety , but Director Medak devotes an unconscionable amount of time to vistas of long , dull corridors and high-angle shots , which prove nothing except that they just do n't build 12-ft. - high ceilings any more . Too bad they do n't revive that lost art and give up on this antique kind of moviemaking . <P> - Richard Schickel
