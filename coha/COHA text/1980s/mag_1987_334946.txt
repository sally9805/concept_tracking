" It 's like the Old West . Whoever draws his gun first wins . Someone lights a cigarette , and another person says , ' You ca n't smoke here . ' Then the first says , ' I dare you to do something about it . ' And there goes the peace and tranquillity of an evening meal . " <P>  --  Joe Patti , owner of La Famiglia restaurant <P> On April 3 a new era began in Beverly Hills : smoking was banned in restaurants and retail stores . Three weeks later many cigarettes remain unlit but scorched tempers are flaring . In cafes and restaurants throughout this clean , orderly city , known for its per capita wealth and celebrity residents , vociferous smokers are shrieking that the new ordinance is fascist , Communist and tyrannical . " It 's the People 's Republic of Beverly Hills , " fumes Irene Robbins , a bookkeeper for the Mandarin , a Chinese restaurant one block from Rodeo Drive . " The smog is ten times worse than anything you 're going to breathe sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puffing away at an outdoor table at Caffe Roma , a lively bistro where sleek Europeans come to meet and gawk . " Why not take cars off the street , booze off the bar and prohibit anything else anyone ever said was bad for you , " grumbles a patron at the Grill , popular with the business-lunch crowd . <P> More rebellious customers have taken action . At Larry Parker 's pricey 24- Hour Diner one recent afternoon , an annoyed patron yanked a woman 's hair as he walked out because she refused to put out her cigarette . At Cafe Beverly Hills , an upscale coffee shop , an elderly man punched his female companion when she told him he must snuff his cigar . " I 've been smoking for 92 years , " said the patron . " No one is going to tell me where I can smoke . " <P> But such celebrity diners as Actor Carroll O'Connor , owner and occasional piano player at the Ginger Man , and cigar-puffing George Burns are willing to conform . " I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debbie Parker , a ban supporter who has a water pistol emblazoned with the words STOP OR I 'LL SHOOT , says , " Smokers have had a lack of consideration for others for a long time . Now the tables are turned . " The Beverly Hills police  --  famed for their vigilance in cracking down on jaywalking , illegal parking and attempted burglary  --  are so far going slowly . They have made no arrests and answered only two calls ; one was a smoking complaint , and the other involved a nicotine lover who went berserk about the ordinance . <P> The Beverly Hills ban is part of a pulmonary consciousness sweeping the land , fueled by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop 's report that secondhand , or " sidestream , " smoke can have a negative effect on the health of nonsmokers . Two years ago Aspen , Colo. , passed the first law to prohibit smoking in most dining rooms . On May 7 New York State will join the trend , restricting smokers in restaurants with 51 or more seats to designated areas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , penalizes disobedient smokers  --  and restaurants that fail to display no-smoking signs  --  with fines of up to $500 . Mayor Charlotte Spadaro , whose mail is running 2 to 1 in favor of the ban , views it as similar to laws " against pollution and toxic waste , designed to make the environment safe for everyone .
