 | was her favorite fairytale . Victor said he liked it too . Leon did n't seem to care . Plainly , as far as he was concerned , this was just another version of the Texaco job . He hardly noticed when Emily came prancing up to him with her hand transformed into Beauty . She cut a stage from a cardboard box , and bought gauzy black cloth for the scrim . She and Victor clowned together , putting on doll-like voices to match the puppets ' round faces . They had the two sisters sing duets and waltz on the kitchen windowsill . Leon just looked grim . He had figured out that most of their fee had already been spent on materials . " This is not going to make us rich , " he said . " But think of next time , " Emily said , " when we 'll already be equipped . " " Oh , Emily , let 's not have a next time .

Mrs. Tibbett led them through the living room to a large , cold clubroom , where Leon and Victor arranged the cardboard stage on a Ping-Pong table . Meanwhile Emily unpacked the puppets . Then she and Victor set the two sister puppets to whispering and snickering , trying to get Leon to join in . He was supposed to work the Beast , which he 'd never even fitted on his hand ; and he 'd had to be told the plot during the drive over . He claimed the only fairytale he knew was " Cinderella . " Now he ignored the puppets and paced restlessly up and down , sometimes pausing to lift a curtain and peer out into the garden . It was because of his parents , Emily thought . This house resembled his parents ' house , which Emily had once visited during semester break . The living room had that same stiff , icy quality , with the pale rugs that no one seemed to have walked on and the empty vases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children were ever allowed to sit . Mrs. Tibbett , even , was a little like Mrs. Meredith  --  so gracious and honeyed , her hair streaked , her mouth tight , with  | something unhappy beneath her voice if Leon would only hear it . Emily reached out to pat his arm , but then stopped herself and curled her fingers in . The doorbell rang  --  a whole melody . " It 's a goddamned cathedral , " Leon muttered . The first guests arrived , and Melissa Tibbett , a thin-faced , homely child in blue velvet , went to greet them . These children were all five years old or just turning six , Mrs. Tibbett had said . They were young enough to come too early , with their party clothes already sliding toward ruin , but old enough , at least , not to cling tearfully to the birthday presents they 'd brought . Emily supervised the opening of the presents . Mrs. Tibbett had vanished , and the two men seemed to think that dealing with the children was Emily 's job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa ) and the shy one who hid in corners ( Jennifer ) . Then she settled them in front of the puppet show . Victor was the father . Emily was each of the daughters in turn . Concealed behind the scrim , she did n't feel much stage fright . " What do you want me to bring you , daughter ? " Victor squeaked . " Bring me a casket of pearls , Father , " Emily piped in a tiny voice . Leon rolled his eyes toward the ceiling . " What do you want me to bring you , Beauty ? " " Only a rose , Father . One perfect rose . " She could see the outlines of the children through the scrim . They were listening , but they were fidgety underneath , she thought . It made her nervous . She felt things were on the verge of falling into pieces . During the father 's long scene alone in the palace , she saw Mrs. Tibbett 's fluttery silhouette enter and stand watching . What a shame ; she 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been laid for me , with lovely foods , " the father said . " And look : a fine gold bed with satin sheets . I wonder to whom this belongs . " Mrs. Tibbett shifted her weight to the other foot .  | Then the Beast arrived . Emily expected him to roar , but instead he spoke in a deep , chortling growl that took her by surprise . " Who 's gobbled up all my food ? " he asked plaintively . " Who 's been sleeping in my bed ? " ( Oh , Lord , she hoped he had n't confused this with " Goldilocks . " ) " My lovely bed , with the satin sheets to keep my hairdo smooth ! " he groaned . The children laughed . An audience . She saw him realize . She saw the Beast raise his shaggy head and look toward the children . Their outlines were still now and their faces were craned forward . " Do you know who ? " he asked them . " Him ! " they cried , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father ! Him ! " The Beast turned slowly . " Oho ! " he said , and the father puppet shrank back , as if blown by the Beast 's hot breath . After the show the maid passed cake and punch around , but most of the children were too busy with the puppets to eat . Emily taught them how to work the Beast 's mouth , and she had Beauty sing " Happy Birthday " to Melissa . Mrs. Tibbett said , " Oh , this was so much better than last year 's Punch and Judy . ' " " We never do Punch and Judy , ' " Leon said gravely . " It 's too grotesque . We stick to fairytales . " " Just one thing puzzles me , " said Mrs. Tibbett . " What 's that ? " " Well , the Beast . He never changed to a prince . " Leon glanced over at Emily . " Prince ? " Emily said . " You had her living happily ever after with the Beast . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loves him and he changes to a prince . " " Oh , " Emily said . It all came back to her now . She could n't think how she 'd forgotten . " Well . . . " she said . " But I guess that would take too many puppets . "  | " No , " Emily said , " it 's just that we use a more authentic version . " " Oh , I see , " Mrs. Tibbett said . By spring they were putting on puppet shows once or twice a week , first for friends of Mrs. Tibbett 's and then for friends of those friends . ( In Baltimore , apparently , word of mouth was what counted most . ) They made enough money so they could start paying Mrs. Apple rent , and Leon quit his Texaco job . Emily went on working at Crafts Unlimited just because she enjoyed it , but she earned almost as much now from the extra puppets that she sold there . And gradually they began to be invited to school fairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night , hastily sewing little Biblical costumes . A private school invited them to give a show on dental hygiene . " Dental hygiene ? " Emily asked Leon . " What is there to say ? " But Leon invented a character named Murky Mouth , a wicked little soul who stuffed on sweets , ran water over his toothbrush to deceive his mother , and played jump-rope with his dental floss . Eventually , of course , he came to a bad end , but the children loved him . Two more schools sent invitations the following week , and a fashionable pedodontist gave them fifty dollars to put on a Saturday-morning show for twenty backsliding patients and their mothers , who ( Emily heard later ) had to pay twentyfive dollars per couple to attend . It was mostly Leon 's doing , their success . He still grumbled any time they had a show , but the fact was that from the start he knew exactly what was needed : dignified , eccentric little characters ( no more squeaky voices ) and plenty of audience participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , so that the children went wild trying to tell them ; always overlooking the ob-  | vious and having to have it explained . Emily , on the other hand , cared more for the puppets themselves . She liked the designing and the sewing and the scrabbling for stray parts . She loved the moment when a puppet seemed to come to life ? usually just after she 'd sewed the eyes on . Once made , a puppet had his own distinct personality , she found . It could n't be altered or submerged , and it could n't be duplicated . If he was irreparably damaged  --  or stolen , which sometimes happened  --  she could only make a new one to fill his role ; she could n't make the same one over again . That was ridiculous , Leon said . She imagined the world split in two : makers and doers . She was a maker and Leon was a doer . She sat home and put together puppets and Leon sprang onstage with them , all flair and action . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the voices for the heroines . Victor was neither maker nor doer , or he was both , or somewhere in between , or . . . What was the matter with Victor ? First he grew so quiet , and paused before answering anything she said , as if having to reel his mind in from more important matters . He moped around the apartment ; he stared at Emily sadly while he stroked his wisp of a mustache . When Emily asked him what his trouble was , he told her he 'd been born in the wrong year . " How can that be ? " she asked him . She supposed he 'd taken up some kind of astrology . " What difference does the year make ? " " It does n't bother you ? " " Why should it bother me ? " He nodded , swallowing . That night at supper he put down his plate of baked beans and stood up and said , " There 's something I have to say . " They still had no furniture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the window , framed by an orange sunset so they had to squint at him from their places on the floor . He laced his fingers together and bent them back so the knuckles cracked . " I have never been a sneaky  | person , " he said . " Leon , I 'd like to announce that I 'm in love with Emily . " Leon said , " Huh ? " " I wo n't beat around the bush : I think you 're wrong for her . You 're such a grouch . You 're always so angry and she 's so . . . un-angry . You think her puppets are nothing , a chore , something forced on you till you get to your real thing , acting . But if you 're an actor , why do n't you act ? You think there 's no theatre groups in this city ? I know why : you had a fight with that guy Bronson , Branson , what's-his-name , when you went to try out . You 've had a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chekhov play because Barry May 's in that and he 'll tell all the others what you 're like . But still you say you 're an actor and you 're so disadvantaged , so held back , wasting your talents here when there 's other things you could be doing . What other things ? " Leon had stopped chewing . Emily felt her chest tightening up . Victor was smaller than Leon , and so young and meek he would never hit back . She imagined him cowering against the window , shielding his head with his arms , but she did n't know how to step in and stop this . " I realize I 'm not as old as Emily , " Victor said , " but I could take much better care of her . I would treat her better ; I 'd appreciate her ; I 'd sit admiring her all day long , if you want to know . We 'd live a real life , not like this , with her ducked over her sewing machine and you off brooding in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one can guess at . . . Well , I 'll say it right out : I want to take Emily away with me . " Leon turned and looked at Emily . She saw that he was n't angry at all . He was relaxed and amused , smiling a tolerant , kindly smile . " Well , Emily ? " he said . " Do you want to go away with Victor ? " She felt suddenly flattened . " Thank you , Victor , " she said , pressing her palms together . " It 's nice of you , but I 'm fine as I am , thank you . "  | " Oh , " said Victor . " I appreciate the thought . " " Well , " Victor said , " I did n't want to sneak around about it. , , Then he sat back down on the windowsill and picked up his plate of beans . The next morning he was gone  --  Victor and his tangle of blankets and his canvas backpack and his cardboard carton of LP records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , it was a relief , in a way . How could they act natural after that ? And she and Leon did need to be on their own . They were a married couple ; it began to seem that they really were married . She was starting to think about a baby . Leon did n't want one , but in time he would come around . They could use Victor 's room for a workshop now , and then for the baby later on . It was lucky Victor had left , in fact . But she hated how his woodsy , brown boy-smell hung in the empty room for days after he had gone . Several times in Emily 's life , similar things had happened . Men had seemed to affix themselves to her  --  but not to her personally , she thought . What they liked was their idea of her . She remembered a boy in her logic class who used to write her notes asking if she would take down her hair for him . Her hair : a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Think of it as longer , thinner fingernails , " she had written back coolly . She disliked being seen from outside that way  --  as someone with blond hair , someone with an oldfashioned face . Once , in New York , a man had started eating every day at the restaurant where she worked , and any time she so much as passed his table he would tell her about his ex-wife , who had also worn braids on top of her head . It was a continuing story : Emily would bring his rolls and he would say , " On our second date we went to the zoo . " She 'd refill his coffee cup and he would say , " I 'm pretty certain she loved me to begin with . " After a couple of weeks he went away , but Emily could n't forget the ex-wife . She was Emily 's other self ; they would have understood each other , but she  | had slipped off and left Emily to take the blame . Now , with Victor , Emily wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was sure  --  poking around in her linty old clothes , hunting up noses for her puppets . It must have been someone else who looked like Emily but had the capacity for a greater number of people in her life . Poor Victor ! It was a pity , Emily thought . She was surprised at how much she missed him . She could not imagine loving anyone but Leon , but when she 'd put a puppet together and longed for someone to try him out on , she thought of Victor and their squeaky-voiced duets . She remembered Beauty 's sisters clowning around at that first birthday party while Leon paced the floor . It was n't so easy to clown around with Leon . She dressed Gina in a T-shirt , pink corduroy overalls , and a snowsuit . She buckled her little red shoes on her feet . Gina was impatient to get going . " Can we swing on the swings ? " she asked . " Not today , honey . " " But I want to swing on the swings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing on the swings ? " She was almost two now . Terrible Two 's : they had minds all their own . But that could be said of Gina at any age . Somehow , this one small child kept both of her parents continually occupied and teetering on the edge of exhaustion . They must be doing something wrong . It did n't look so hard for other people . Emily put a coat on and tied a scarf over her hair . It was February , a damp , cold day . Even the apartment was cold . She poked her head into the kitchen to say goodbye to Leon . He was sitting at the chipped enamel table they 'd bought from Goodwill , reading the Village Voice . " Leon ? " she said . " I 'm taking Gina for a walk . " " You want me to come along ? "  | " Oh , no , I 'll be back soon . " He nodded and returned to his paper . Emily led Gina out the door . They went down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the glass door at the front of the building . She checked the laundromat across the street . No one was there . She hoisted Gina into her arms and set off toward Beacon Avenue . Gina kept struggling to get down ; she liked to go places under her own steam . ( It took her all day . ) By now she was so heavy that it was difficult to hold on to her . Emily went faster than she 'd intended to , pulled forward by Gina 's tilted weight . Her slippers made a rustling , patting sound . They arrived at the E-Z Cafeteria five minutes early , but Leon 's mother was already waiting , seated alertly at the foremost table with her hands crossed over her purse . When she saw Emily ( when she saw Gina , really ) , she seemed to open like a flower . Her face lifted , her hands uncrossed themselves , and the feathers on her hat stirred . " Ah ! " she cried . She rose and brushed her cheek against Emily 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told Emily . " I did n't know if you 'd want to bring her out in this weather . " " Oh , she 's out in any weather , " Emily said . Mrs. Meredith settled Gina in the high chair she 'd already wheeled up . " Was she cold ? " she crooned . " Did her little face get frozen ? " She unwrapped her like a package , and patted Gina 's thick , dark hair . " Oh , exactly like Leon 's hair , " she said . ( She always did . ) " Will you look at how she 's grown ? Just in this one month she 's grown so that I never would have known her . Though of course I 'd know her anywhere , " she said , contradicting herself . Gina gazed at her reflectively . She was always quieter in her grandmother 's presence . The E-Z Cafeteria was not Mrs. Meredith 's style , but it was one place they could manage Gina . They could wheel her down the food line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could leave without delay any time she got restless . It had taken them a while to figure this out . They 'd started off at the Elmwood  --  Mrs. Meredith 's suggestion , a  | place near Towson , to which Emily had had to travel by lnus . It was the only Baltimore restaurant Mrs. Meredith knew of . And , to be fair , she 'd had no idea she was inviting a baby to lunch as well . What had happened was , when Emily got married she had naturally informed her Great-Aunt Mercer , back in Taney . Aunt Mercer had not been very pleased , but she 'd made the best of it . On her thick , silver-rimmed stationery , which smelled as if she 'd kept it in her basement for the last ten years , she wrote to ask Emily who this young Meredith might be . What 's his daddy 's name ? Would I be likely to know any of his people ? He is n't one of those Nashville Merediths , is he ? And once she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents a get-acquainted note . Next Leon received a letter from his mother , sent direct to his New York address : Mr. Leon Meredith . No mention of Emily . He threw it away unopened . " Oh , Leon ! " Emily said . It was true she was n't comfortable with his parents , but you could n't just discard your only relatives . Leon said , " I told you that was a mistake , writing your aunt . I said it would be . " And the letter stayed in the wastebasket . They moved to Baltimore , but the letters followed , for all his mother had to do was ask Aunt Mercer for his new address . And Leon went on throwing the letters away . Maybe eventually he 'd have opened one ( this could n't last forever , could it ? ) , but then the Merediths did something unforgivable . They gave his forwarding address to his draft board . It was n't malicious , Emily was certain , but Leon thought it was . " That 's my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have me dead in the jungle than alive and happy without them . " He went on cursing them even after he failed the physical . One leg was found to be an inch and a half shorter than the other , the result of a broken thighbone in his childhood . No one had ever noticed it before . He returned with a painful limp and said , " I 'm free , but I wo n't forget what they tried to do to me . " And he continued throwing their letters away .  | If Emily 's name had been on the envelopes too , she 'd have opened them . She was pregnant by then and wishing for her mother . Aunt Mercer was no use  --  with her dim , steely handwriting : The crocuses are late this year and the rodents have been at my galanthus bulbs  --  and Mrs. Apple was sympathetic but had no recollection of childbirth . ( " Perhaps I was put to sleep , " she said . " Do they give anesthesia for such things ? I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) Emily dreamed that Mrs. Meredith would suddenly arrive in person , miraculously plumper and more motherly , and she 'd fold Emily into her lap and let her be a daughter again . But she never did . Then , three months after Gina 's birth , there it was : Mrs. Leon Meredith . Emily marveled at how long it had taken . She smuggled the letter into the bathroom and locked the door behind her to read it . I know it must be you who 's keeping our boy from us. 1 saw from the start you were a cold little person . But he is our only child . Think how we must feel . Emily was stunned . She could n't believe that anyone would be so unfair . Her eyes blurred and the sheet of bricks shimmered in the window . Why are you saying these things ? she wrote back . I have nothing to do with any of this and I do n't understand it . It 's between you and Leon . His mother said , It seems you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we start over ? Could we meet at the Elmwood this Wednesday at noon ? Emily did n't want to meet her . She felt like ripping the letter to shreds . She looked at Gina , who lay crowing in her cardboard box , and she tried to imagine anything Gina could do  --  marrying , mismarrying , committing murder  --  that would sever her from Emily 's life as Leon had severed himself from his parents ' . There was nothing . She just would n't allow it . Gina was the whole point ; even what Emily felt for Leon seemed pallid by comparison . She smoothed the letter  | on her lap and saw Mrs. Meredith 's tense , powdery face , with the eyebrows plucked as thin as two arched wires and the lids beneath them always a little puffed , as if she were on the edge of tears . There were certain rules , Emily had been taught . She would have to go just this once . Mrs. Meredith came by taxi , all the way from Richmond . Evidently , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . The driver sat at the next table , spreading pate on a cracker and reading Male magazine . Mrs. Meredith waited behind a foggy martini glass . Her back was very straight . Then Emily entered with Gina riding the way she liked to in those days  --  hanging over Emily 's forearm , with her bottom propped against Emily 's hip , frowning darkly at her own bare toes . " Oh ! " Mrs. Meredith cried out , and one hand flew to her throat , knocking the martini glass into her lap . Now that she thought back , Emily felt she really should have prepared Mrs. Meredith . It was too theatrical  --  bursting in with an unannounced grandchild . It was more like something Leon would have done . She seemed to have caught some of Leon 's qualities . He seemed to have caught some of hers . ( He seldom spoke of moving on any more . ) She was reminded of those parking-lot accidents where one car 's fender grazes another 's . It had always puzzled her that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . You 'd think the paint would only be on one car , not both . It was as if they had traded colors . She tried to tell Leon about the lunch , once it had taken place . She led into it gradually . " Your mother 's been writing me now , you know , " she said . But Leon said , " Emily , I do n't want to hear about it and I do n't want you to have anything to do with it . Is that clear ? " " All right , Leon , " Emily said . And , oddly enough , even Mrs. Meredith seemed content to let things be . It seemed she only wanted the connection ; just who made the connection did n't matter so much . She  | liked to hear from Emily what Leon was up to . Did he help to care for Gina ? " He walks her at night , and he baby-sits while I 'm working in the shop , " Emily told her , " but he ca n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Burt was , " Mrs. Meredith said . " Oh , exactly ! " But she never tried to press any closer than that . Maybe she found things easier as they were . She often retreated into stories about Leon 's childhood , when he had been someone she could understand . " He was a beautiful baby , " she said . " All the nurses told me so . Prettiest baby they 'd ever seen ! They could n't believe their eyes ! " Somehow , everything she said had a way of slipping out of her control . " Even the doctors stopped by to take a look . This one man , a heart surgeon , he came straight from an operation just to get a glimpse of him . Mrs. Meredith , ' he said , I never saw a baby so beautiful in my life . Yes , sir , we 're going to hear more of that young man . He 's going to amount to something someday ! ' He called his wife on the telephone ; I heard him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got here ! Ought to see this baby ! ' " Next , Emily thought , there 'd be a star beaming over the delivery room . She began to understand why Leon got so edgy around his mother . Mrs. Meredith 's rouged face , gazing brightly at a boy no one else could see , seemed deliberately shuttered and obstinate . In fact , she made Emily feel edgy as well , and Emily never enjoyed these lunches , or came any closer to liking Mrs. Meredith . Telling her a piece of news  --  or even speaking to Gina in Mrs. Meredith 's presence  --  Emily heard her own voice take on a fulsome tone that was n't hers at all . She felt that nothing she could say would ever live up to Mrs. Meredith 's expectations . But what could she do ? The very day after their lunch at the Elmwood , Mrs. Meredith started driving lessons . In a month she had her license and a brand-new Buick , and she drove the entire distance from Richmond to Baltimore although , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked going over thirty miles per  | hour . When she telephoned Emily from a corner booth , breathlessly announcing , " I did it ! I 'm here to take you to lunch , " could Emily just say , " No , thank you , " and hang up ? They settled into a schedule : the first Wednesday of every month . Emily never told Leon about it . She knew that eventually , Gina would tell . Now that Gina could talk , it was only a matter of time . " When me and Grandma was eating . . . " she 'd say , and Leon would say , " You and who ? " and then all hell would break loose . Till then , Emily went dutifully to lunch , frowning slightly with concentration . One time Mr. Meredith came too . He seemed baffled by the baby . He let his wife do all the talking , while he stared around at the dingy old men slurping soup in the E-Z Cafeteria . " So where 's this son of mine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . very busy at home , " Emily said . " Would you believe he was once the size of this little tyke ? " he asked , jutting his chin at Gina . " I could carry him in the palm of my hand . Now we 're not on speaking terms . " " Burt , " said Mrs. Meredith . " He was always quick to throw things away . " Later , when it was time to go , he asked Emily if she had all her equipment . " Equipment ? " Emily said . " Equipment . You know . " Maybe he was asking if she were sane , marrying his son . But then he said , " Crib , playpen , high chair , carriage ... " " Oh . We do n't need all that , " Emily said . " She sleeps in a cardboard box . It 's perfectly comfortable . " " I 'll send her a crib , " Mr. Meredith said . " No , Mr. Meredith , please do n't do that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard box ! " he said , and he went away shaking his head and looking pleased , as if his expectations , at least , had every one been fulfilled . The crib arrived : white , spooled , with an eyelet canopy . She 'd never heard of such nonsense . Two delivery men came  | puffing up the stairs with it and leaned it , unassembled , against the wall in the hallway . She reached a finger inside a plastic bag and touched an eyelet ruffle . Then Leon walked in , tossing from hand to hand the cabbage she 'd asked him to get at the market . " What 's all this ? " he asked . " Your parents sent it , " she said . He took a step backward from the crib . " Leon , " she said . " While we 're on the subject , I ought to tell you something . " He said , " I do n't want to hear , I do n't want to know , and I want this monstrosity gone by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , still carrying the cabbage . Emily thought it over . She mashed a banana for Gina 's supper and fed it to her , absently taking a few bites herself . She looked out the kitchen doorway and into the hall , where the crib stood slanting elegantly . At that time Gina was six months old , and outgrowing her cardboard box . She slept more often with her parents , still munching drowsily on Emily 's breast . It would be nice to have a safe container to keep her in , Emily thought . She scraped banana off Gina 's chin and stuffed it back into her mouth . She looked at the crib again . When Leon came back , the crib was still there , but he did n't mention it . Maybe he 'd been doing some thinking himself . The following day Emily started assembling it . She would join two pieces and then leave it a while , as if it were only something to fiddle with  --  a crossword puzzle , a hoop of needlework . Then she 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the paper . In a few days she had a completed crib . It seemed silly to leave it obstructing the hall , so she wheeled it into their bedroom . The effect was dazzling . All that white made the rest of the room seem drab . Their mattress on the floor had a lumpy , beaten look . She went back to the hall for Gina and carried her into the bedroom and set her in the crib . Gina stared all around her at the eyelet ruffles , the decals , the bars . What a shock , she seemed to be saying . How did this imprisonment come about ?  | It came about inch by inch . These things just wear you down . This child had changed their lives past recognition , more than they had dreamed possible . You would think that someone so small could simply be fitted into a few spare crannies and the world could go on as usual , but it was n't like that at all . From the start , she seemed to consume them . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiastic , an insomniac who seldom took naps and struggled continually toward a vertical position . They would lay her down on her stomach for the night and instantly her head would bob up again , weaving and unsteady , her eyes so wide that her forehead seemed corrugated . She loved to be talked to , sung to , tossed in the air . As she grew older , she fell in love with Red Riding Hood 's wolf and they had to give him up to her . If she slept at all , she slept with the wolf against her cheek and she dreamily twisted his red felt tongue . Periodically the tongue fell off and then she would go to pieces  --  crying and clinging to Emily till Emily sewed it back on . And she hated to be left . Hannah Miles , across the hall , was glad to baby-sit , but any time Emily and Leon went out , Gina wept as if her heart would break and Emily would have to stay . Or Leon would make her leave anyway , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained with Gina , and all through the movie or whatever she would fidget , buttoning and unbuttoning her coat , not hearing a word . Then Leon would be angry with her and they 'd have a fight and the outing would be wasted , but later when they returned , Gina would be wide awake and smiling , at eleven or twelve at night , reading books with Hannah and hardly noticing they were back . They never asked , of course , whether she was worth it . They centered their lives on her . They could marvel forever at the small , chilly point of her nose , or her fat-ringed fingers  | or precisely cut mouth . When finally she fell asleep , the absence of all that fierce energy made the apartment feel desolate . Emily would drift through the rooms not knowing what to do next , though she 'd wanted to do so much all day and never had a chance to begin . She wondered how they 'd managed to produce such a child . She herself had always been so subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire but none of her joyous good nature . Where did she get that ? She was a changeling . She had arrived with someone else 's qualities . She was the gnome 's baby , not theirs . He stood in the laundromat doorway with his hat pulled low and he sank back into the darkness as they passed . Sometimes the hat was pointed , sometimes flat , sometimes broadbrimmed . Sometimes it seemed he had aged , was slackening , falling apart as certain people suddenly do ; he was seen in gold-rimmed spectacles and his beard was cut to such a stubble that he might merely have neglected shaving himself . Then later he would reappear miraculously young again , the spectacles gone , the beard in full bloom . On occasion he was not gnomish at all but just a rather beakish , distinguished gentleman in suits so tidy you had the impression someone else had dressed him . On other occasions he could have stepped into a puppet show and not been out of place . He had a gait they would know anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless , bent-kneed , lunging gait , half running , landing on the balls of his feet . But once he was seen plodding out of a secondhand-clothing store with the resigned deliberation of a middle-aged man , and he had let his hair grow unsuitably long so it straggled in an unkempt and pathetic way over the back of his collar . At Christmas , Leon thought he saw him at a puppet show all the way over near Washington ; but maybe it was just someone like him , he said . Then later he told Emily he 'd been stupid  --  not for thinking it was he ( the man was everywhere , after all ) , but for imagining there could be anyone else , anyplace , at any time , the faintest bit like Morgan .  | Morgan 's oldest daughter was getting married . It seemed he had to find this out by degrees ; nobody actually told him . All he knew was that over a period of months one young man began visiting more and more often , till soon a place was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the rest of the family when Bonny wanted to know what color to paint the dining room . His name was Jim . He had the flat , beige face of a department-store mannequin , and he seemed overly fond of crew-necked sweaters . And Morgan could n't think of a thing to say to him . All he had to do was look at this fellow and a peculiar kind of lassitude  | would seep through him . Suddenly he would be struck by how very little there was in this world that was worth the effort of speech , the entanglements of grammar and pronunciation and sufficient volume of voice . Then Amy started beginning every sentence with " we . " We think this and we hope that . And finally : when we 're earning a little more money ; when we find a good apartment ; when we have children of our own . This just crept in , so to speak . No announcements were made . One Sunday afternoon Bonny asked Morgan if he thought the back yard was too small for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it 's not just the size ; it 's the weather , " Bonny said . " What if it rains ? You know how the weather can be in April . " " But this is already March , " Morgan said . " We 'll all sit down this evening , " said Bonny , " and come to some decision . " So Morgan went to his closet and chose an appropriate costume : a pinstriped suit he 'd laid claim to after Bonny 's father died . It stood out too far at the shoulders , maybe , but he thought it might have been what Mr. Cullen was wearing when Morgan asked him for permission to marry Bonny . And certainly he 'd been wearing his onyx cufflinks . Morgan found the cufflinks in the back of a drawer , and he spent some time struggling to slip them through the slick , starched cuffs of his only French-cuffed shirt . But when the four of them sat down for their discussion , no one consulted Morgan in any way whatsoever . All they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a caterer , or should they prepare the food themselves ? Amy thought a caterer would be simplest . Jim , however , preferred that things be homemade . Morgan wondered how he could say that , having eaten so many suppers here . Bonny was n't much of a cook . She leaned heavily on sherry  --  several glugs of it in any dish that she felt needed more zip . Everything they ate , almost , tasted like New York State cocktail sherry . Morgan sat in the rocking chair and plucked out his beard ,  | strand by strand . If he got up right now and left , he told himself , they might not even notice . He reflected on a longstanding grievance : there was one of Bonny 's pregnancies that she 'd forgotten to inform him about . It was the time she 'd been expecting Liz , or maybe Molly . Bonny always said he was mistaken ; of course she 'd told him , she recalled it clearly . But Morgan knew better . He suspected , even , that she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get annoyed by her slapdash attitude toward various birth-control methods . To his certain knowledge , the very first inkling he 'd had of that pregnancy was when Bonny arrived in the kitchen one morning wearing the baggy blue chambray shirt she habitually used as a maternity smock . He was positive he would have remembered if she 'd mentioned it to him . " Amy will start down the stairs , " Bonny said . Evidently , they were planning the actual ceremony now . " Her father will meet her at the bottom and walk her to the center of the living room . " " Daddy , promise me you wo n't wear one of your hats , " Amy said . Morgan rocked in his chair and plucked on , thinking of the tall black father-of-the-bride top hat he would purchase for the occasion . He knew just where he could find one : Tuxedo Tom 's Discount Formal Wear . He began to feel slightly happier . But later , when Jim and Amy had gone out , he sank into a spell of sadness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was small . She 'd had large , exaggerated curls swooping upward at each ear , so that she seemed to be wearing a Dutch cap . That Dutch-capped child , he thought , was whom he really mourned  --  not the present Amy , twenty-one years old , efficient secretary for a life-insurance company . He recalled how he had once worried over her safety . He 'd been a much more anxious parent than Bonny . " You know , " he told Bonny , " I used to be so certain that one of the children would die . Or all of them , even  --  I could picture that . I was so afraid they 'd be hit by cars , or kidnapped , or stricken with  | polio . I 'd warn them to look both ways , not to run with scissors , never to play with ropes or knives or sharp sticks . Relax , ' you 'd say . Remember ? But now look : it 's as if they died after all . Those funny little roly-poly toddlers , Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? They did die . I was right all along . It 's just that it happened more slowly than I 'd foreseen . " " Now , dear , this is just an ordinary life development , " Bonny told him . He looked at her . She was seated at the kitchen table , working on the guest list for the wedding . On the wall above her was something like a hat rack  --  a row of short wooden arms . When you pressed a pearl pushbutton anywhere in this house , there was a clunk from the kitchen gong and one of the wooden arms would fly up , alerting a non-existent servant . Beneath each arm a yellowed label identified the room that had rung  --  or ( in the case of bedrooms ) the person . Mr. Armand . Mrs. Armand . Miss Caroline . Master Keith . Studying these labels , Morgan had the feeling that a younger , finer family lived alongside his , gliding through the hallways , calling for tea and hot-water bottles . Evenings , the mother sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children , one on either side of her . A boy , a girl ; how tidy . At dinner they discussed great books , and on Sunday they dressed up and went to church . They never quarreled . They never lost things or forgot things . They rang and waited serenely . They gazed beyond the Gowers with the placid , rapt expressions of theatregoers ignoring some petty disturbance in the row ahead . " I 'd like to invite Aunt Polly , " Bonny said , " but that means Uncle Darwin , too , and he 's so deaf and difficult . " She was peering through black-framed , no-nonsense glasses , which she 'd just started wearing for reading . Morgan said , " So did you die , when you think of it . " " Me ? " " Where 's that girl I used to take out walking ? I used to  | hold on to your arm , high up , and you would look off elsewhere and get pink , but you would n't pull away . " Bonny added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking ? I do n't remember that . I thought we always drove . " He slid his fingers down the inside of her upper arm , where the skin was silkiest . The back of his hand brushed the weight of one breast . She did n't seem to notice . She said , " Luckily , Jim does n't have many relatives . " " She must be marrying him out of desperation . " Then she did look up . She said , " Could n't you still love the girls anyhow ? You do n't stop loving people just because they change size . " " Of course I love them . " " Not the same way , " she said . " It seems you get fixed on this one appearance of a person ; I mean , this single idea you have . " She clicked her ballpoint pen . " And anyway , why leap ahead so ? They have n't all grown up . Molly and Kate are still in high school . " " No , no , they 're gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out every evening , off somewhere , up to something . . . they 're gone , all right . " He brightened . " Aha ! " he said . " Alone at last , my dollink ! " But it called for too much effort . He drifted over to the stove , depressed , and lit a cigarette on a burner . " House feels so damn big , we need a ride-'em vacuum cleaner . " " You always did want more closet space , " Bonny told him . " They 've dumped their hamsters on us and gone away . " " Morgan . There were nine of us at dinner tonight , counting your mother and Brindle . When I was a little girl , any time there were nine at table we had to send downtown for Mattie Ida to come help serve . " " What we ought to do is move , " Morgan said . " We could get a house in the country , maybe , live off the land . " He pictured himself in sabots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a one-room cabin with a huge stone fireplace , a braided rug , and a daybed covered in some hand-woven  | fabric . Unbidden , Amy in her Dutch-cap curls bounced in the center of the daybed . He winced . " I 'll take an early retirement , " he said . " Forty-five feels older than I 'd thought it would . I 'll retire and we 'll have some time to ourselves . Wo n't that be nice ? " " Now , do n't go off on one of your crazy schemes , " Bonny told him . " You 'd die of boredom , retiring . You 'd feel useless . " " Useless ? " Morgan said . He frowned . But Bonny was on the track of something new , thoughtfully tapping her pen against her teeth . She said , " Morgan , in this day and age , do you believe the bride 's mother would still give the bride a little talk ? " " Hmm ? " " What I want to know is , am I expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Bonny , do you have to call it sex ? " " What else would I call it ? " " Well ... " " I mean , sex is what it is , is n't it ? " " Yes , but , I do n't know ... " " I mean , what would you say ? Is it sex , or is n't it ? " " Bonny , will you just stop hammering at me ? " " Anyhow , " she said , returning to her list , " in this day and age , I bet she 'd laugh in my face . " Morgan rubbed his forehead with two fingers . Really , it occurred to him , if Bonny had been more serious , more responsible , none of this upheaval would be happening . Or at least it would n't be happening quite so soon . It seemed to him that she had let the children slip through her fingers in some sort of sloppy , casual , cheerful style that was uniquely hers . He recalled that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Washington , she 'd lost all eight of her charges in the Smithsonian Institution . They 'd been found among showcases full of savages , copying down the recipe for shrunken heads . At the school 's annual mother-daughter picnic , where everyone else brought potato salad and lemonade , Bonny brought a sack of Big Macs and a thermos of  | Chablis . Yes , and she had such a disastrous effect upon machinery ; she had only to settle behind the steering wheel and instantly the car fell apart . Warning lights would blink , steam would issue from the radiator , the muffler would drop off , and hubcaps would roll in every direction and clang along the gutters and slither down storm drains . She 'd make one simple right turn and the turn signal would never work again . No wonder he spent half his weekends on his back in the garage ! And she 'd passed all this on to the girls too . The first driving lesson he gave Amy , the left front window had slid down inside the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the dealer . And then there was his sister , who had n't been out of that bathrobe of hers since Christmas . It hung on her like old orchid petals , wilted , striated , heavy-smelling . And his mother 's memory was failing more than ever now , though she flew into a fury if anyone hinted as much . At supper , proving her sharpness , she 'd recite whole portions of " Hiawatha " or the Rubaiyat . " Come , fill the Cup . . . ! " she 'd start up out of nowhere , slamming a fork against her glass , and Brindle would say , " Oh , Jesus , not again , " and all the others would groan and fall into their separate , disorderly factions around the table . Useless ? Living this life of his was such hard work that even if he retired tomorrow , he had no hope of feeling useless . Amy stood at the top of the stairs , wearing white and carrying roses . The hall window behind her lit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs Morgan waited with his hand on the newel post . He wore his new top hat and a pure-black suit from Second Chance . ( There 'd been a little fuss about the hat , but he 'd held his ground . ) He had trimmed his beard . Gold-rimmed spectacles ( window glass ) perched on his nose . He felt like Abraham Lincoln . One of Morgan 's failings was that formal , official proceed-  | ings  --  weddings , funerals  --  never truly affected him . They just did n't seem to penetrate . He 'd lain awake half of last night mourning his daughter , but the fact was that now , with the ceremony about to begin , all that was on his mind was Amy 's roses . He had distinctly heard the wedding-dress lady tell her to carry them low , at arm 's length  --  too low , even , she said , because if Amy were nervous at all she 'd tend to lift them higher . And now , before the music had even started , Amy had her bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't see that it made the slightest difference ) , but he wondered why nervousness should cause people to raise their arms . Was it something to do with protecting the heart ? Morgan experimented . He clasped his hands first low , then high . He did n't find the one any more comforting than the other . With his hands folded just beneath his beard , he tried a dipping rhythmic processional , humming to himself as he sashayed across the hall . " Daddy , " Amy hissed . Morgan dropped his hands and hurried back to the newel post . Kate set the needle on the record . The wedding march began in mid-note . In the living room the guests grew suddenly still ; all Morgan heard was the creaking of their rented chairs . He smiled steadily up at Amy , his spectacles catching the light and flashing two white circles across her face . With her hand trailing down the banister , weightless as a leaf , Amy set a pointed satin slipper in the center of each step . Her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian carpet . Yesterday morning Bonny had taken a red Magic Marker and colored in the bare spots in the carpet . Then she 'd used a brown Magic Marker for the rips in the leather armchair . ( Sometimes Morgan felt he was living in one of those crayoned paper houses that the twins used to make . ) Amy reached the hallway and took his arm . She was trembling slightly . He guided her into the living room and down the makeshift aisle . On this same stringy rug he had walked her for hours when she was just newborn . He had nestled her head on his  | shoulder and paced the length of the rug and back , growling lullabies . The memory did n't stir him . It was just there , just another , lower layer in this room that was full of layers . He led her up to Bonny 's minister , a man he disliked . ( He disliked all ministers . ) Amy dropped his arm and took a place next to what's-his-name , Jim . Morgan stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined behind him . He rocked a little to the lullaby in his head . " Who gives this woman to be married ? " the minister said . From the way the question rang in the silence , Morgan suspected it might have been asked once before without his noticing . He seemed to have missed part of the service . " Her mother and I do , " he said . It would have been more accurate to say , " Her mother does . " He turned and found his seat next to Bonny , who was looking beautiful and calm in a blue dress with a wide scoop neckline that kept slipping off one or the other of her shoulders . She laid a hand on top of his . Morgan noticed a gray thread of cobweb dangling from the ceiling . Jim put a ring on Amy 's finger . Amy put a ring on Jim 's finger . They kissed . Morgan thought of a plan : he would go live with them in their new apartment . They did n't know a thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their kitchen machines within a week and their household accounts would he a shambles , and then along would come Morgan to repair and advise . He would go as an old man , one of those really bereft old men with no teeth , no job , no wife , no family . In some small area he would act helpless , so that Amy would feel a need to care for him . He would arrive , perhaps , without buttons on his shirt , and would ask her to sew them on for him . He had no idea how to do it himself , he would tell her . Actually , Morgan was very good at sewing on buttons . Actually , he not only sewed on his own buttons but also Bonny 's and the girls ' , and patched their jeans and altered their hemlines , since Bonny was n't much of a seamstress . Actually , Amy was aware of this . She was also aware that he was  | not a toothless old man and that he did have a wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know you so well . You could n't make the faintest little realignment of the facts around them . They kept staring levelly into your eyes , eternally watchful and critical , forever prepared to pass judgment . They could point to so many places where you had gone permanently , irretrievably wrong . 3 There 'd been a compromise on the food . Bonny had ordered several trays from the deli , and then Morgan had picked up some cheese and some crackers which the girls had put together this morning . He 'd been upset to discover that there was apparently no discount outlet for gourmet cheeses . " Do you know what these things cost ? " he asked the groom 's father , who had a hand poised over a cracker spread with something blue-veined . Then he wandered across the yard to check on the Camembert . It was surrounded by three young children  --  possibly Jim 's nephews . " This one smells like a stable , " the smallest was saying . " It smells like a gerbil cage . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zoo ! " The weather had turned out fine , after all . It was a warm , yellow-green day , and daffodils were blooming near the garage . A smiling brown maid , on loan from Uncle 011ie , bore a tray of drinks through the crowd , picking her way carefully around the muddy patches where the spring reseeding had not yet taken hold . The bride stood sipping champagne and listening to an elderly gentleman whom Morgan had never seen before . His other daughters  --  oddly plain in their dress-up clothes  --  passed around sandwiches and little things on toothpicks , and his mother was telling the groom 's mother why she lived on the third floor . " I started out on the second floor , " she said , " but moved on account of the goat . " " I see , " said Mrs. Murphy , patting her pearls .  | " This goat was housebroken , naturally , but the drawback was that I am the only person in this family who reads Time magazine . In fact , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goat had only been trained on Time magazine . I mean , he would only . . . I mean , if the necessity arose , the only place he was willing to . . . was on a Time magazine spread on the floor . He recognized that red border , I suppose . And so you see if I were to lay my magazine aside even for a second , why , along this animal would come and just . . . would up and . . . would ... " " He 'd pee all over it , " Morgan said . " Tough luck if she was n't through reading it . " " Oh , yes , " Mrs. Murphy said . She took a sip from her glass . At Morgan 's elbow , in a splintered wicker chair , an unknown man sat facing in the other direction . Maybe he was from the groom 's side . He had a bald spot at the back of his head ; fragile wisps of hair were drawn across it . He raised a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Billy ? " Morgan said . He went around to the front of the chair . Good God , it was Billy , Bonny 's brother . " Nice wedding , Morgan , " Billy said . " I 've been to a lot , you know  --  mostly my own . I 'm an expert on weddings . " He laughed . His voice was matter-of-fact , but to Morgan it was the misplaced , eerie matter-of-factness sometimes encountered in dreams . How could this be Billy ? What had happened here ? Morgan had last seen Billy not a month ago . He said , " Billy , from the back of your head I did n't know you . " " Really ? " Billy said , unperturbed . " Well , how about from the front ? " From the front he was the same as ever  --  boyish-looking , with a high , round forehead and dazzling blue eyes . But no , if you met him on the street somewhere , would n't he be just another half-bald businessman ? Only someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bones in his slackening face . Morgan stood blinking at him . Billy seemed first middle-aged and anonymous ; then he was Bonny 's high-  | living baby brother ; then he was middle-aged again  --  like one of those trick pictures that alter back and forth as you shift your position . " Well ? " Billy said . " Have some champagne , why do n't you ? " Morgan asked him . " No , thanks , I 'll stick to scotch . " " Have some cheese , then . It 's very expensive . " " Good old Morgan , " Billy said , toasting him . " Good old , cheap old Morgan , right ? " Morgan wandered away again . He looked for someone else to talk to , but none of the guests seemed his type . They were all so genteel and well modulated , sipping their champagne , the ladies placing their high heels carefully to avoid sinking through the sod . In fact , who here was a friend of Morgan 's ? He stopped and looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Amy 's , or the groom 's . A twin flew by  --  Susan , in chiffon . Her flushed , earnest face and steamy spectacles reminded him that his daughters , at least , bore some connection to him . " Sue ! " he cried . But she flung back , " I 'm not Sue , I 'm Carol . " Of course she was . He had n't made that mistake in years . He walked on , shaking his head . Under the dogwood tree , three uncles in gray suits were holding what appeared to be a committee meeting . " No , I 've been letting my cellar go , these days , " one of them was saying . " Been drinking what I have on hand . To put it bluntly , I 'm seventy-four years old . This June I 'll be seventy-five . A while back I was pricing a case of wine and they recommended that I age it eight years . Good enough , ' I started to say . Then I thought , Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the oddest moment . I said , No , I suppose it 's not for me . Thanks anyway . ' " At a gap in the hedge , Morgan slipped through . He found himself on the sidewalk , next to the brisk , noisy street , on a normal Saturday afternoon . His car was parked alongside the curb . He opened the door and climbed in . For a while he just sat there , rubbing his damp palms on the knees of his trousers . But the sun through the glass was baking him , and  | finally he rolled down a window , dug through his pockets for the keys , and started the engine . These were his closest friends : Potter the musical-instrument man , the hot-dog lady , the Greek tavern-keeper on Broadway , and Kazari the rug merchant . None of them would do . For one reason or another , there was n't a single person he could tell , " My oldest daughter 's getting married . Could I sit here with you and smoke a cigarette ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through darkening levels of water . All 's Fair Pawnshop , Billiards , Waterbeds , Beer , First House of Jesus , souL BROTHER DO NOT BURN . Flowers were blooming in unlikely places  --  around a city trashcan and in the tiny , parched weedpatch beneath a rowhouse window . He turned a corner where a man sat on the curb flicking out the blade of his knife , slamming it shut with the heel of his hand , and flicking it out again . He traveled on . He passed Meller Street , then Merger Street . He turned down Crosswell . He parked and switched the engine off and sat looking at Crafts Unlimited . It was months since he 'd been here . The shopwindow was filled with Easter items now  --  hand-decorated eggs and stuffed rabbits , a patchwork quilt like an early spring garden . The Merediths ' windows were empty , as always ; you could n't tell a thing from them . Maybe they 'd moved . ( They could move in a taxi , with one suitcase , after ten minutes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked toward the shop . He climbed the steps , pushed through the glass door , and gazed up the narrow staircase . But he did n't have what it took to continue . ( What would he say ? How would he explain himself ? ) Instead , he turned left , through a second glass door and into the crafts shop . It smelled of raw wood . A grayhaired , square-boned woman in a calico smock was arranging hand-carved animals on a table . " Hello , " she said , and then she glanced up and gave him a startled look . It was the top hat , he supposed . He wished he 'd worn something more appropriate . And why were there no other customers ? He was all alone , conspicuous , in a roomful of quilted silence .  | Then he saw the puppets . " Ah , so ! " he said . " Ze poppets ! " Surprisingly , he seemed to have developed an accent  --  from what country , he could n't say . " Zese poppets are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the woman said . They lay on a center table : Pinocchio , a princess , a dwarf , an old lady , all far more intricate than the first ones he 'd seen . Their heads were no longer round , simple , rubber-ball heads but were constructed of some padded cloth , with tiny stitches making wrinkles and bulges . The old-lady puppet , in particular , had a face so furrowed that he could n't help running his finger across it . " Wonderful ! " he said , still in his accent . " They 're sewn by a girl named Emily Meredith , " the woman told him . " A remarkable craftsman , really . " Morgan nodded . He felt a mixture of jealousy and happiness . " Yes , yes , " he wanted to say , " do n't I know her very well ? Do n't I know both of them ? Who are you , to speak of them ? " But also he wanted to hear how this woman saw them , what the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding the puppet . The woman turned back to her animals . " Perhaps I see her workroom , " he said . " Pardon ? " " She leeve nearby , yes ? " " Why , yes , she lives just upstairs , but I 'm not sure she ? " " Zis means a great deal to me , " Morgan said . Across from him , on the other side of the table , stood a blond wooden cabinet filled with weaving . Its doors were wavery glass , and they reflected a shortened and distorted view of Morgan  --  a squat , bearded man in a top hat . ToulouseLautrec . Of course ! He adjusted the hat , smiling . Everything black turned transparent , in the glass . He wore a column of rainbow-colored weaving on his head and a spade of weaving on his chin . " You see , I also am artiste , " he told the woman . Definitely , his accent was a French one . She said , " Oh ? " " I am solitary man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do n't think you understand , " she said . " Emily and her husband , they just give puppet shows to children , mainly . They only sell puppets when they have a few extras . They 're not exactly ? " " Steel , " he said , " I like to meet zem . I like you to introduce me . You know so many people ! I see zat . A friend to ze artistes . What your name is , please ? " " Well . . . Mrs. Apple , " she said . She thought a moment . " Oh , all right . I do n't suppose they would mind . " She called to someone at the rear , " Hannah , will you watch for customers ? " Then she turned to lead Morgan out the side door . He followed her up the staircase . There was a smell of fried onions and disinfectant . Mrs. Apple 's hips looked very broad from this angle . She became , by extension , someone fascinating : she must speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their habits , water their plants when they went on tour . He restrained the urge to set a friendly palm on her backside . She glanced at him over her shoulder , and he gave her a reassuring smile . At the top of the stairs she turned to the right and knocked on a tall oak door . " Emily ? " she called . But when the door opened , it was Leon who stood there . f le was holding a newspaper . When he saw Morgan , he drew the paper sharply to his chest . " Dr. Morgan ! " he said . Mrs. Apple said , " Doctor ? " She looked at Morgan and then at Leon . " Why , " she said , " is this the doctor you told me about ? The one who delivered Gina ? " Leon nodded . " But I thought you were an artist ! " Mrs. Apple said . " You said you were an artist ! " Morgan hung his head . He shuffled his feet . " I was embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just recently come from a wedding ; I know I look ridiculous . I said I was an : artist so you would n't laugh at me . " " Oh , you poor man , " Mrs. Apple said . Then she did laugh . " You and your zis and zat . ' Your zese and zose. ' "  | He risked a glance at Leon . Leon was n't laughing . He was glaring at Morgan , and he kept the newspaper clamped to his chest as if guarding secrets . " I do want to see your workroom , " Morgan told him . " I may buy a large number of puppets . " " We do n't have a large number , " Leon said . " Oh , come on , Leon , " Mrs. Apple said . " Why not show him ? What 's the harm ? " She nudged Morgan in the side . " You and your artistes . ' Your poppets . ' " She started laughing again . Her eyes grew rays of wrinkles at the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he said ungraciously , and he stepped back and turned to lead them down the hall . Morgan peered swiftly into the room on his right  --  a flash of sunken sofa and a half-empty bookcase . On his left was the kitchen ; he had an impression of cold , gleaming whiteness . The next door on the left led to the workroom . There was no real furniture at all  --  just a sewing machine beneath the window , and a stubby aluminum stepladder on which Emily sat snipping paper . Her black skirt drooped around her , nearly obscuring the ladder . The braids on top of her head picked up light from somewhere and glinted like flying sparks . " Emily , " Leon said . She looked up . Then she jumped off the stepladder and hid whatever she was doing behind her back . " What do you want ? " she asked Morgan . " Why , Emily . Goodness , " Mrs. Apple said . " This is Dr. Morgan . Do n't you recognize him ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppets , Emily . " " Buy them downstairs , " said Emily , white-faced . You would think she had something against him . Morgan tried not to feel hurt . He smiled at her . He said , " I like to see the process of things . Actually . " " There 's no process going on here . " He stroked his beard . Mrs. Apple said , " But . . . Emily ? Show him the shadow puppets . " She told Morgan , " She 's trying something new ,  | Doctor : shadow puppets , out of paper . See ? " She crossed to the sewing machine and took something from one of its drawers . It was the silhouette of a knight in armor , attached to a slender rod . " You notice he 's hinged at the joints , " she said . " You work him behind a screen . He casts a shadow on the screen . Is n't that clever ? " " Yes , certainly , " said Morgan . He looked around the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sewing machine . The stepladder , maybe ? Even in his fondest fantasies he had not imagined such starkness . He was fascinated . " And will you be using shadow puppets in your shows now ? " he asked Emily . " Yes , " she said shortly . " No , " Leon said . There was a pause . Mrs. Apple gave a little laugh . " With shadow puppets , " Leon said , " it 's all how they 're hinged , nothing more . How Emily caused their joints to swing when she made them . " " So ? " Emily said . " You just scoot them along the ledge behind the screen , and their joints fall into place . There 's nothing to do , even less to do than there is with the old kind of puppets . " " So ? " They stared at each other . Morgan cleared his throat . " Is that your child I 'm hearing ? " he asked . Of course it was . She was singing something in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nobody answered him . He poked his head out into the hall . Then he crossed the hall and went into the bedroom . There was a mattress in one corner and a bureau in another , and a narrow cot along one wall . A child sat on the cot , fitting Tinker Toys together . She sang , " . . . how to get to Sesame Street . .. " When she saw Morgan , she stopped . Morgan said , " Hello there . " She looked at him doubtfully . He heard the Merediths coming , and he said quickly ,  | " Would you like my hat ? " He tore his hat from his head and set it on hers , tilting it back so it would n't engulf her completely . From the doorway , Emily said , " Gina ! Take that off . You never try another person 's hat on . " " It 's my hat , " Gina said . " He gave it to me . " " Take it off , " Leon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pointed chin ; she had to keep her chin raised so the hat would n't slide down over her eyes . This made her look proud and challenging . In fact , she resembled Leon , Morgan thought . When Emily tried to lift the hat from her head , Gina fought her hands away . " It 's my hat . It 's mine . " Morgan said , " Surely . It 's a gift . " Emily stopped struggling , but she continued to stand between Morgan and the child , shielding her . Her eyes were pale and cold . She had her arms folded tightly , and Leon stood firm beside her . Mrs. Apple said , " Dr. Morgan ? " She arrived breathless , and handed him another shadow puppet . This one was a king . He might have stepped out of a stained-glass window ; red and blue transparent paper covered the pierced design in his robe . Lit behind a screen , he would cast jewel-like colored shadows . " Is n't he marvelous ? " Mrs. Apple said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . " " That 's true , I could , " Morgan said . He stroked the colored paper with a thumb . Something about the precision of the design made him feel sad and deprived . His gaze slid off the king and away , landing finally on the bureau . Its top was nearly bare . There were no bottles or safety pins or ticket stubs ; just a single framed photo of Leon and Emily holding hands in front of this building . Gina rode on Leon 's shoulders . Her plump little calves bracketed his neck . All three of them were smiling squintily into the sunlight . Morgan stepped closer and bent over the photo , pinching his lower lip between his thumb and index finger . The king hung for-  | gotten in his left hand . Bemused , he peered into a drawer that was partway open . Then he opened it further and studied its contents : three white shirts and a box of Kleenex . " Dr. Morgan ! " Emily said sharply . " Yes , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying a hand on Gina 's head as he passed . Her hair was so soft , it seemed to cling to his fingers for several seconds afterward . Back in the workroom , he said , " What do you do with Gina while you 're giving your puppet shows ? " Emily turned away , refusing to answer , but Leon said , " We take her along . " " And ? Does she help with the productions ? " " Oh , no . She 's just barely turned four . " " She knows the ropes , though , " Morgan suggested . " She was raised backstage , after all . She knows to stay quiet while a play is going on . " " Gina ? " Leon said . He laughed . " Gina 's never been quiet a full minute in her life . We have to keep hushing her all through the show , and if it 's a birthday party , it 's worse . She cries when someone else gets to blow out the candles . She hates it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you ought to see one of their shows , " said Mrs. Apple . She slid the king out of Morgan 's hand . Without noticing , he 'd rucked up one corner of the colored paper . " They 're getting so well known ! They 've been all the way to Washington . And a man who runs an entertainment company wanted to just take them over , make them part of his troupe , like professionals . What did you ever tell that man , Leon ? Did you ever answer his letter ? " " I threw it away , " Leon said . " Threw it away ! " " It was some kind of Bible group . Gospel singers and things . " " But  --  threw it away ! You could at least have answered it . " " And off in some poky town , " Leon said . " Tinville , Tindale ... "  | " I doubt you ever answer letters , " Morgan said . He felt suddenly pleased and excited . Leon said , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why complicate your lives ? You go downstairs to clear out the mailbox every now and then , and you glance at what 's there and toss it all in the wastebasket and come back empty-handed . " " Well , sometimes , " Leon said . " When ? " Emily asked him . Then she turned to Morgan and said , " We 're not who you believe we are . " " Eh ? " " We 're not who you imagine . " " Come look at Rip Van Winkle , " Mrs. Apple said . " We live like anyone else . We manage fine . We like to be left alone , " said Emily . " Let me show you to the door . " " Oh , but Emily ! " Mrs. Apple said . " He has n't seen all the puppets ! " " He 's seen enough . " " He wanted to buy a large number ! " " No , no , that 's all right . . . I really must be going , " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door , a swirl of black skirt , and he followed her . They went down the hallway single-file ? Emily , Morgan , Leon . Mrs. Apple stayed behind , no doubt looking around at the puppets in bewilderment . " Maybe some other time ? " she called after him . " Yes , maybe so . . . " He skidded on a Tinker Toy and said , " Oh , excuse me , " and lurched against the wall . He clapped a hand to his head . " I 'd better go home and change , " he said . " Change ? " Leon asked . " Yes , I . . . need another hat . " His voice was echoing now ; they 'd reached the stairs . But instead of starting down , he looked at the door across the landing . " Who lives there ? " he asked . " Joe and Hannah Miles , " said Leon , but Emily said , " No one . "  | " Miles ? Are they craftsmen also ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily told him . She pushed forward , edging him toward the stairs , and when he took his first step down , she followed so closely that he felt hounded . " I do n't understand you , " she said . ( He should have known . She would not veil anything ; she was as uncurtained as her windows . ) " What do you want of us ? What are you after ? Why did you trail us all those months and lurk in doorways and peer around corners ? " " Oh ? You noticed ? " Morgan said . He staggered with embarrassment and grabbed the banister . " You could have come straight up and said hello , like ordinary people . " " Yes , but I was so . . . I 'd built up this idea of you . I almost preferred watching , do n't you see . My own household is impossible . Very confusing , very tedious , " he said . He stopped , halfway down the last flight of stairs . " Oh , you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Big-city doctor ! Saving lives . But mostly it 's a treadmill . I work too far downtown ; I attract a low class of patient . Twice I 've had my office robbed by addicts looking for drugs , and one of those times I was present . They tied my secretary to her chair with a raincoat belt and they made me go through all my desk drawers . It was unnerving . There I was , tumbling out sample packs of decongestants , sinus tablets , pediatric nosedrops .. . I 'm not a brave man . I gave them all I had . I tell you this to show you what sort of existence I lead , Emily , Leon ... " He was out of breath . He felt a white space inside his head , as if he were standing at an unaccustomed altitude . " Just hear what happened last summer , " he said . " I had this patient who 'd been stabbed . Stabbed in front of a Fells Point bar , something to do with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead of night . That 's the kind of practice I have  --  such fine patients . And no answering service , no condominium in Ocean City where I can vanish over the weekend . . . Anyhow . He had a long , shallow cut all down the left side , from the ribcage to the hipbone , fortunately clear  | of the heart . I laid him on the table in my office and stitched him up right then and there . Took me an hour and a quarter ? a tiresome job , as you might imagine . Then just as I 'm knotting the last stitch , wham ! The door bursts open . In comes the man who stabbed him . Pulls out a knife and rips him down the right side , ribcage to hipbone . Back to the needle and thread . Another hour and a quarter . " Leon gave a sudden snort of laughter , but Emily just nudged Morgan forward . Morgan resumed his descent , leaning heavily on the banister like someone old and rheumatic . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eyes . . . self-healing things . A man who does sedentary work ? a taxi driver , say  --  will spend the weekend moving furniture and then call me out of bed on a Sunday night . Doc , I got the most terrible backache . Do you think it could be a disk ? A fusion ? Will I need an operation ? ' For this I went to medical school ! " " Here , " said Emily . They had reached the front door . She pushed it open for him and held out her hand . " Goodbye , " she told him . Leon grinned anxiously behind her , as if trying to ease the insult . Morgan took her hand and was startled by its lightness and its dryness . " You do n't want to be friends at all , do you ? " he said . " No , " Emily told him . " Ah , " he said . " And why would that be ? " " I do n't like how you try to get into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pried into . " " Emily , " Leon said . " No , no , " Morgan told him . " It 's quite all right . I understand . " He looked away , toward his dusty , sagging car . He had no feelings whatsoever . It seemed he 'd been emptied . " Maybe you could meet my wife , " he said with an effort . " Would you like to meet Bonny ? Have I told you about her ? Or you might like my children . I have very nice children , very normal , very ordinary ; they seem determined to be ordinary . . . Two are in high school . One 's grown , really , a secretary ; and four others are in college , here and there . Most  | of the year , they 're gone . We hardly hear from them . But that 's the way it is , right ? Every parent says that . You can see that I 'm a family man . Does that help ? No , I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's hand . He dropped it . " The oldest girl 's getting married , " he said . " I 'm not a doctor . I work in a hardware store . " Emily said , " What ? " " I manage Cullen Hardware . " " But . . . you delivered our baby ! " she said . " Ah , well , " he told her , " I have n't witnessed three of my daughters ' births for nothing . " He patted all his pockets , hunting cigarettes , but when he found a pack , he just stood holding it and looking into their stunned faces . " That stabbing business , well , I read it in the paper , " he said . " I presented myself untruthfully . I do that often , in fact . I often find myself giving a false impression . It 's not something I intend , you understand . It almost seems that other people conspire with me , push me into it . That day you called for a doctor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this long , long silence . And it seemed like such a simple thing  --  offer some reassurance , drive you to the hospital . I had no inkling I 'd actually have to deliver a baby . Events just . . . rolled me forward , so to speak . " He wished they would say something . All they did was stare at him . Meanwhile a girl in an old-fashioned dress climbed the front steps and said , " Hello , Emily , Leon , " but they did n't even glance at her , or move aside when she slipped past them and through the open door . " Please . It 's not entirely my fault , " he said . " Why are people so willing to believe me ? Just tell me that . And this is what 's depressing : they 'll believe me all the quicker if I tell them something disillusioning . I might say , for instance , that being a movie star is not what it 's cracked up to be . I 'll say the lights are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pinkish-gray stain around the inside of my collar that my wife despairs of . Clorox has no effect on it ; not even Wisk does , though she 's partially solved the problem by pre-  | vention . What she does , you see , is rub my collar with a bar of white bath soap before I put a shirt on . Yes , that seems to work out fairly well , I 'll say . " " This is crazy , " Leon told him . " Yes , " said Morgan . " You must be crazy ! " But Emily said , " Well , I do n't know . I see what he means , in a way . " Both men turned to stare at her . Leon said , " You do ? " " He just . . . has to get out of his life , sometimes , " she said . Then Morgan gave a long , shaky sigh and sank down on the stoop . " My oldest daughter 's getting married , " he said . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | The newspaper said , Crafts Revival in Baltimore ? Festival Begins June 2 . There was a picture of Henry Prescott , ankle-deep in wood chips , carving one of his decoys . There was a picture of Leon Meredith holding up a puppet , with his wife beside him and his daughter at his feet . He was a grim , handsome , angular man , and his mouth was sharply creviced at the corners . He was not a young boy any more . It took a photo to make Emily see that . She placed the paper on the kitchen table , pushing away several breakfast dishes , and leaned over it on both elbows to study it more closely . The porous texture of the newsprint gave Leon a dramatic look  --  all hollows and steep planes . Next to him , Emily  | seemed almost featureless . Even Gina failed to show how special she was . " The whole idea , " Leon was quoted as saying , " is improvisation . We take it moment by moment . We adapt as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand  --  not the puppets . The puppets are my wife 's doing . She makes them according to a fixed pattern . They 're not improvised . " This was true , in a way , and yet it was n't . Emily did have a homemade brown-paper pattern for the puppets ' outlines , but the outlines were the least of it . What was important was the faces , the dips and hills of their expressions , which tended to develop unexpected twists of their own no matter how closely she guided the fabric through the sewing machine . Yes , definitely , the puppets were improvised too . She wished she 'd spoken up when that reporter was interviewing them  --  said something to defend herself . " The heads are padded , " Leon said , " and stiffened with some kind of sizing . My wife mixes the sizing . She has her own recipe , her own way of doing things . I 'm allowed to help with the props sometimes , but my wife insists on making the puppets totally by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went down the hall to the back room . It was Gina 's room now . The sewing machine and the muslin bags had been moved to the room Leon and Emily shared ; Gina 's belongings had multiplied too far to be contained in one small corner . Her unmade bed was laden with stuffed animals , books , and clothes . In the rocking chair by the window sat a Snoopy dog bigger than Gina . Grandma and Grandpa Meredith had brought it for her sixth birthday . Emily felt it was ridiculous to give a child something that size  --  not to mention the cost . What could they have been thinking of ? " Oh , well , " Leon had told her , " that 's just how they are , I guess . You know how they are . " Gina was under the bed . She emerged , frowsy-haired , with a sneaker in her hand . " Are n't you ready yet ? " Emily asked her . " It 's time to go . "  | " I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and loosened a knot in the lace . " Now , Gina , listen , " she said . " We 've got a play to give out in the county today , and we 're leaving before you get back . When kindergarten 's over , you walk home with the Berger girls and wait in the shop till we come . Mrs. Apple says she 'll keep an eye on you . " " Why ca n't I stay home and go with you ? " " Summer will be here soon enough , " Emily told her . " You 'll be home all the time , come summer . " She slipped the sneaker on Gina 's foot and tied it . Gina 's socks were already creased and soiled and falling down her ankles . Her blouse had egg on the front . Emily had known children like Gina when she was a child herself . They had a kind of extravagant squalor ; there was something lush about the tumbled appearance of their clothing . She had always assumed their mothers were to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ago Gina had been neat as a pin ; Emily had made certain of it . She plucked a dust bail from Gina 's hair , which was rich and thick-stranded like Leon 's . " Come along , " she told her . " You 'll be late . " She slung her purse on her shoulder and they left the apartment , clicking the latch very gently because Leon was still asleep . They walked down the stairs , where everyone 's breakfast smells hung in the air  --  bacon , burned butter , the Conways ' kippered herrings . They passed the door of the shop , which was still dark , and stepped out into the street . It was a warm , sunny morning . The city looked freshly washed , with gold-lit buildings rising through a haze in the distance , women in spring dresses sweeping their stoops , green ivy flooding through the windows of an abandoned rowhouse . Gina hung on to Emily 's hand and skipped and sang : Miss Lucy had a baby , She called it Tiny Tim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could swim .. .  | Emily said good morning to Mrs. Ellery , who was shaking out her dust mop , and to the ancient blind man whose daughter , or granddaughter it must have been , set him on his stoop every fair day with a grayish quilt wrapped around his legs . " Nice weather , " Emily called , and the old man nodded , turning his sealed-looking eyelids toward the sun like a plant in the window . She stopped on the second corner to wait for the Berger girls . Helena Berger shooed them out the door ? two little freckled redheads in plaid dresses . They ran ahead with Gina , and at the next intersection Emily had to call , " Stop ! Wait ! " She hurried up , out of breath , while they lurched and teetered on the edge of the curb . She held out her hands , and the younger Berger girl took one and Gina took the other . The Berger child was all bones ; Emily felt a rush of love for Gina 's warm , chubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She waded across the street , embroiled in children , and turned them loose on the other side . They scattered ahead again , skipping disjointedly . Miss Lucy called the doctor , Miss Lucy called the nurse , Miss Lucy called the lady With the alligator purse .. . Emily sensed a presence nearby , the shape of someone familiar , and she turned and found Morgan Gower loping along beside her . He tipped his battered green Army helmet and smiled . " Morgan , " she said . " How come you 're out so early ? " " I could n't sleep past five o'clock this morning , " he said . " There 's too much excitement at the house . " At Morgan 's house there was always too much excitement . She 'd never been there , but she pictured a bulging , seething box of a place  --  the roof straining off , the side seams splitting . " What is it this time ? " she asked him . " It 's Brindle . My sister . Her sweetheart came back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shaded  | her eyes and called , " Children ! Wait for me ! " Then she said , " Did Kate get out of her leg cast yet ? " " Who ? " he asked . " Oh , yes . Yes , that 's all . . . but see , at seven or so last night , just at the end of supper , the doorbell rang and Bonny said , Brindle , go see who that is , will you ? ' since Brindle was nearest the door , so Brindle went and then . . . " They 'd reached the intersection . Emily held out her hands and the children swarmed around her , knocking Morgan backward a pace . When she 'd crossed to the other side and turned to look for him , he was picking up his helmet from the gutter . He polished it with his sleeve , sadly , and set it on his head . It matched his splotchy camouflage jacket and his crumpled olive-drab jungle pants . He was always dressing for catastrophes that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed , certified , snake-proof boots , " he said now . He stopped to hold up one green foot . " I bought them at Sunny 's Surplus . " " They 're very nice , " she said . " Children ! Slow down , please . " " How come you have those other two girls ? " Morgan asked . " I do n't remember seeing them before . " " I 'm trading off with their mother . She 's walking Gina home today so that I can do a show . " " Well , it all seems so disorganized , " Morgan said . " I come to you people for peace and quiet and I find this disorganization . Look at Gina : she has n't even said hello to me . " " Oh , she will ; you know she loves to see you . It 's only that she 's with friends . " " I prefer it when you both come and Gina walks between you , just the one of her . Where 's Leon ? Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was out late last night , trying for a part in a play . " " It 's too disorganized , " Morgan said glumly . He stopped and peered down the front of his jacket . Then he reached inside and brought up a pack of cigarettes . " So Brindle goes  | to the door , " he said , " and nothing more happens . There 's nothing but silence . Well , we thought she might have faded off somewhere . Forgot where she was headed . Lost her way or something . You know Brindle . Or at least , you know about her : always in that bathrobe , moping . How was your day ? ' you ask , and she says , Day ? ' She acts surprised to hear there 's been one . Go see where she 's got to , ' Bonny tells me . She 's your sister ; see what she 's up to . ' So I push away from the table and go to find her and there she is in the entrance hall being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those long , deep , wrap-around kisses , like in the movies . I was uncertain what to do about it . It seemed rude to interrupt , but if I turned and left they 'd no doubt hear the floorboards creak , so I just stood there flossing my teeth and the two of them went on kissing . Heavy-set man with slicked-down hair . Brindle in her bathrobe . Finally I ask , Was there something you wanted ? ' Then they pulled apart and Brindle said , It 's Robert Roberts , my childhood sweetheart . Do n't you know him ? ' " " Children ! " Emily called . They 'd reached another intersection . She ran ahead to take their hands . Morgan followed , muttering something . " Known him all his life , of course " was what it sounded like . " Knew him when he was a bit of a thing , coming to play roll-a-bat with Brindle in the alley . Called her Idiot . Dumbhead . Moron , ' in that fond , insulting way that childhood sweethearts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cracked concrete , teeming with shabby children . Emily bent to kiss Gina goodbye . " Have a good day , honey , " she said , and Morgan said , " How about old Morgan ? No kiss for Uncle Morgan ? " He bent over , and Gina threw her arms around his neck and kissed his cheek . " Come by after school and help me again with my yo-yo , " she said . " All right , sugar-pie . " " You promise ? " " Absolutely . Have I ever let you down ? " When she ran off , he stood watching after her , smiling and  | tapping cigarette ashes across the toes of his boots . " Ah , yes . Ah , yes , " he said . " What a darling , eh ? I wish she 'd stay this size forever . " " I hate that school , " Emily said . " Why ! What could be wrong with it ? " " It 's so crowded ; classes are so big , and I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd like to send her someplace private . Leon 's parents have offered to pay , but I do n't know . I 'd have to think how to bring it up with Leon . " " No , no , leave her here . Do n't forsake your principles , " Morgan said . He took her elbow and turned her toward home . " I never thought you 'd send your daughter to a private school . " " Why not ? What principles ? " Emily asked . " You sent yours to private schools . " " That was Bonny 's doing , " Morgan told her . " She has this money . We never see it , never buy anything inspiring with it , but it 's there , all right , for things that do n't show  --  new slate roof tiles and the children 's education . Her money is so well behaved ! I would have preferred a public school , myself . Why , surely . You do n't want to cart her off to some faraway place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention it while Leon was out of the room , " Emily said . " On purpose , I guess . He must be hoping I 'll wear Leon down , so when the subject comes up again Leon will be used to it . But I have n't said a word , because Leon 's so proud about money . And you know what a temper he has . " " Temper ? " Morgan said . " He might just explode . " " Oh , I ca n't picture that . " " He 's always had this angry streak . " " I ca n't picture that at all , " Morgan said . He stopped and looked around him . " I would offer to take you for a drive , " he said , " just to celebrate the return of Robert Roberts , do n't you know . I 'm much too keyed up to work today . But , unfortunately , my car 's been stolen . "  | " Oh , that 's terrible , " Emily said . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her . " Now ? This morning ? " " This instant , " he said . He pointed to an empty place at the curb , beside a mailbox . " I parked it here , where I thought you might be passing . Now it 's disappeared . " Emily 's mouth dropped open . " There , there , I 'm not upset , " he said . " As you would say : what 's a car , after all ? " He spread his arms , smiling . " It 's only an encumbrance . Only another burden . Right ? I 'm better off without it . " Emily did n't know how he could talk that way . A car was very important . She and Leon had been saving for one for years . " You ought to call the police immediately , " she told him . " Come back with me and use our telephone . Time really matters . " " There 'd be no point , " he said . " I 've never had much faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead her on . The grip of his tense , warm fingers reminded her of Gina . " Last summer , " he said , " while we were driving to the beach , a state trooper flagged us down and asked us for a lift . He said his patrol car had been stolen . Can you imagine ? He got in the rear with Molly and Kate and my mother . . . those big , shiny boots , gun in a holster . . . he leaned over the front seat and saw Bonny , saw her eating an apple core . You want to watch it with those seeds , ' he told her . He said , My cousin Donna used to love appleseeds . Best part of the apple , she claimed . One year me and my brother saved up all our seeds in a Baby Ben alarm-clock box and gave them to her for Christmas . She was thrilled . She ate them every one , and by evening she was dead . Here 's where I get off , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was the last we saw of him . It seemed he 'd only popped in to bring us this message , you know ? And then departed . I said to Bonny , I told her , Think of it , the lives of ordinary citizens in the hands of a man like that . Walking around with a gun , ' I said .  | No doubt loaded , no doubt cocked , or whatever it is you do with a gun . ' " " Yes , but . . . " Emily said . She was about to tell him that surely the next policeman would n't be so peculiar . But then she wondered . Some people , it appeared , attract the peculiar all their lives . " Well , anyway , " she said , " it would n't hurt just to give the police a phone call . " " Maybe not , maybe not , " Morgan said . He was reading a chipped and peeling sign : EUNOLA 'S RESTAURANT . " Is this place any good ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lived right here in the neighborhood and never tried Eunola 's ? " " It 's a matter of money . " " Let 's go in and have some coffee , " Morgan said . " I thought you had to open your store . " " Oh , Butkins will do that . He 's happier without me , to tell the truth . I get in the way . " He pulled open the door and shepherded Emily in ahead of him . There were four small tables and a counter where a row of men in hard hats sat drinking their coffee under a veil of cigarette smoke . " Sit , " Morgan said , guiding her to a table . He settled opposite her . " Do you know what this means , this Robert Roberts business ? Do you see the implications ? Why , it 's wonderful ! First the years go by and Brindle stays in her bathrobe , moping , scuffing about in her slippers , wondering when the next meal is . Fix it yourself , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , Well , ' she says , I do n't know where anything 's kept , the food and utensils and such . ' Understand , this is a house she 's been living in since nineteen . . . was it sixty-four ? Or maybe sixty-five , she moved in . Kate was already in school , I remember . Sue had started her piccolo lessons . . . Then here comes Robert Roberts ! Here he comes , out of the blue . He says his wife is dead now . And anyhow , he says , his heart was always with Brindle . I ca n't imagine why . She 's very plain to  | look at and she 's not at all good-natured . But his heart was always with her , he says . And he was the very person she 's been telling us about at the dinner table , every night of our lives . Why , our children knew Robert Roberts 's name before they knew their own ! They knew all his favorite board games and his batting average . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most colossal heap of roses ; the whole entrance hall took on that rainy , dressed-up smell that roses have . . . and asking her to marry him ! Is n't life . . . symmetrical ? I 'd really underestimated it . " A waitress stood over them , tapping her pencil . Emily cleared her throat and said , " I 'll have coffee , please . " " Me too , " said Morgan . " Yes , it was quite a night . The two of them sat up till dawn , discussing their plans . I kept them company . They want to get married in June , they say . " " You certainly have a lot of weddings in your family , " Emily told him . " Oh , not really , " he said . He reached across the table for her purse , opened it , and peered inside . " There was Amy 's , of course , and then Jean 's , but I do n't count Carol 's ; she got divorced before she 'd finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down and shook it . Emily 's wallet fell out , followed by a key ring . He shook the purse again , but it was empty . " Look at that ! " he said . " You 're so orderly . " Emily retrieved her belongings and put them back in her purse . Morgan watched , with his head cocked . " I too am orderly , " he told her . " You are ? " " Well , at least I have an interest in order . I mean , order has always intrigued me . When I was a child , I thought order might come when my voice changed . Then I thought , no , maybe when I 'm educated . At one point I thought I would be orderly if I could just once sleep with a woman . " He took a napkin from the dispenser and unfolded it and smoothed it across his knees . Emily said , " Well ? "  | " Well , what ? " " Did sleeping with a woman make you orderly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sighed . Their coffee arrived , and he seized the sugarbowl and started spooning out sugar . Four teaspoons , five . . . he stirred after each spoonful , and dripped coffee on the tabletop and into the bowl . Caramel-colored beads grew up across the surface of the sugar . Emily looked at them and then at Morgan . Morgan bared his teeth at her encouragingly . She looked away again . Why put up with him ? He was really so strange that sometimes , out in public , she felt an urge to walk several paces ahead so that no one would guess they were acquainted . Or when the three of them were together , she 'd make a point of raking Leon 's arm . But it was funny how he grew on a person . He added something ; she could n't say just what . He made things look more interesting than they really were . Sometimes he accompanied the Merediths when they went to put on a puppet show , and from the squirrel-like attention he gave to all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occupation was  --  itinerant puppeteers ! Well , not itinerant , exactly , but still . . . and she 'd look at Leon and realize what a flair he had , with his deep , dark eyes and swift movements . She herself would feel not quite so colorless ; she would notice that Gina , who sometimes struck her as a little blowzy , was just like one of those cherubic children on a nineteenth-century chocolate box . " Leon 's picture was in the paper , " she told Morgan now . " Eh ? " She leaned forward . She saw that this must be why she 'd agreed to stop for coffee . " There was an article , " she said , " in the morning paper , all about our puppets . " " Oh , I missed it , " he said . " I left the house too early . " " They had a picture of the three of us , but really it was Leon 's article , " she said . Morgan lit a cigarette and tipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the puppets , how they 're . . . oh , not improvised . How they 're cut from a pattern . " She folded her hands and examined her knuckles . " He meant something by that . It 's hard to explain . If I tell you what it meant , you 'll think I 'm imagining things . " " You probably are , " Morgan said . " And last night , this play he went to try for . . . what he used to do in the old days was , he 'd memorize a part for tryouts . He would n't just go and read it , like other people . He had this very quick memory . It always made an impression . So yesterday afternoon he started to learn the part he wanted , and it turned out he could n't do it . He 'd memorize one line and go on to the next , but when he put the two together he found he 'd forgotten the first one and he 'd have to begin all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines , finally , just from hearing them ; but he still did n't . And he blamed me for it . He did n't say so outright , but he did . I know . " " You 're imagining things , " Morgan said . " It 's true that he 's changed since he met me , " Emily said . Morgan rocked on his chair legs , smoking and frowning . He said , " Did I ever tell you I was married once before ? " " What ? No , I do n't think so . And now he 's so friendly with his parents . Well , of course he can say that 's all my doing ; I used to be the only one who spoke to them . But now it seems . . . well , truthfully , they visit a little too much . He gets on with them a little too well . " " I married during my senior year in college , " Morgan said . " Her name was Letitia . We eloped and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , we lost interest in each other . It was the funniest thing . We took up with different crowds ; Letitia became involved in an antique-music group and went off to New York over Christmas vacation . . . we drifted apart , as they say . We went our separate ways . " Emily could n't see why he was telling her this . She made an effort and sat straighter in her chair . " Is that right ? " she said . " So you got a divorce ? "  | " Well , no . " " What happened , then ? " " Nothing happened , " Morgan said . " We just went our ways . No one knew about the elopement , after all . " Emily thought back over what he 'd told her . She said , " But then you 'd be a bigamist . " " Technically speaking , I suppose I am , " Morgan said cheerfully . " But that 's illegal ! " " Well , yes , I guess it is , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really very natural , " he told her . " It 's quite fitting , when you stop to consider . Are n't we all sitting on stacks of past events ? And not every level is neatly finished off , right ? Sometimes a lower level bleeds into an upper level . Is n't that so ? " " Honestly , " Emily said . " What has this got to do with anything ? " She reached for her purse and stood up . Morgan stood too and came lunging around to pull her chair back , but she was too quick for him . She did n't even wait for him ro pay the cashier . She walked on out the door and left him at the register , and he had to run to catch up with her . " Emily ? " he said . " I have to be getting home now . " " But I seem to have strayed from my point . All your talk of bigamy , legalities , you made me forget what I wanted to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I believe you 're telling out-and-out lies . I believe you just told me one . You did , did n't you ? Did you ? Or not ? " " See , Emily , " Morgan said , " of course he 's changed . Everybody does ; everyone goes bobbing along , in and out of inlets , snagging on pilings , skating down rapids . . . Well , I must n't get carried away . But , Emily , you 're still close . You have n't parted directions . You 're still very much alike . " " Alike ! " said Emily . She stopped in front of a newsstand . " How can you say that ? We 're totally different . We come  | fom totally different backgrounds . Even our religions are different . " " Really ? " said Morgan . " What religion is Leon ? " " Oh , Presbyterian , Methodist . . . " She started walking again . " We 're nothing at all alike . " " To me you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " " Ha , " said Emily bitterly . " You have the happiest marriage I know of , Emily . I love your marriage ! " " Well , I ca n't think why , " Emily said . But she let herself fall into step with him . They passed a woman painting her front door a bright green . " Apple green , my favorite color ! " Morgan called , and the woman laughed and bowed like someone on a stage . They passed an open window where Fats Domino sang " I 'm Walkin ' , " and Morgan spread his arms and started dancing . The fact that he had a cigarette clamped in his teeth made it look difficult and precarious ; he reminded Emily of those Russians who dance with a glass of vodka on their heads . She stood to one side , awkwardly swinging her purse and smiling . Then Morgan stopped and took his cigarette from his mouth . " Why , look at that , " he said . He was staring at something just behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parked next to a mailbox . " My car ! " he said . " Your what ? " " It 's my car ! " " Are you sure ? " But that was a silly question ; even Emily was sure . ( And why would he claim such a ruined object , otherwise ? ) Morgan rushed around it , breathing rapid puffs of smoke . " See ? " he said . " There 's Lizzie 's tennis racket , my turban , my sailor suit that I was bringing home from . . . See that Nehi bottle ? It 's been rolling up and down the back window ledge for the past six months . Or , " he said , pausing , " is it possible that someone else might have a car just like this ? "  | " Really , Morgan , " Emily said . " Of course it 's yours . Go call the police . " " What for ? Why not just steal it back ? " " Well , you want the thief arrested , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but meanwhile it 's parked in a No Parking zone and I might be given a ticket . " " When it was n't you that parked it there ? " " You never can tell , in this world , " he said . " I promised Bonny I would n't run up more traffic fines . " He was trying all the doors , but they were locked . He walked around to the front of the car and settled on his haunches before the grille . " I do n't suppose you have your Swiss Army knife with you , " he said . " My what ? No . " He plucked at a string that was looped through the grille . Then he set his face close and started gnawing at the string . The woman who 'd been painting lowered her brush and turned to watch . " I do n't understand what you 're after , " Emily said . " The key , " Morgan said . Something clinked to the ground . He groped beneath the car for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Closer to the wheel . " Morgan stretched out on his stomach , with his legs trailing behind him . ( The soles of his snake-proof boots were as deeply ridged as snow tires . ) He reached farther under the car . " Got it , " he said . A little three-wheeled mail truck the size of a golf cart bounced up and stopped . " Help ! " Morgan shouted , and he raised his head . She heard his helmet clang against the underside of the bumper . " I 'm hit ! " he said . " Morgan ? " " I 'm run over ! It 's my leg ! " A mailman descended from the truck , whistling , and started toward the mailbox . Emily grabbed his sleeve and said , " Move . " " Huh ? " " Move the truck ! You 've run a man over . "  | " Sheesh , " said the mailman . " Do n't he see the No Parking sign ? " " Move that truck this instant , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the mailman said . He turned back to his truck , glancing down at Morgan on the way . Morgan showed him a face that seemed all teeth . " Hurry , " said Emily , wringing a handful of skirt . Meanwhile the woman with the paintbrush arrived , dripping apple green . " Oh , that poor , poor man , " she said . Emily knelt next to Morgan . She had a sick weight on the floor of her stomach . But at least there was no blood . Morgan 's leg , pinned at the shin beneath the toy tire , looked flattened but still in one piece . He was breathing raggedly . Emily laid a hand on his back . " Are you in pain ? " she asked him . " Not as much as you might expect . " " He 's going to move the truck . " " Of all the damn-fool , ridiculous ? " " Never mind , it could happen to anyone , " Emily said , patting his back . " I was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released his brake . The truck gave a grinding sound and inched backward . " Oof ! " said Morgan . He rolled free . He sat up and inspected his leg . A dusty , wedge-shaped mark ran down the green fabric . " Is it broken ? " Emily asked him . " I do n't know . " " Rip his pants , " the woman with the paintbrush suggested . " Not the pants ! " said Morgan . " They 're World War Two . " Emily started folding up the cuff , working gingerly , tensed for what she might have to see . By now , two old ladies with shopping bags had joined them , and the mailman was telling them , " I could report him for illegal parking , if I was that bad of a guy . " " There 's nothing here , " Emily said . She was inspecting Morgan 's pale , hairy shin . " Can you wiggle your toes ? "  | " Yes . " " Can you stand ? " 1 le attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was heavier than he looked , hard-muscled , warm , and he gave off the harsh gray smell of someone who 'd been smoking for a very long time . " Yes , " he said , " I can stand . " " Maybe he just ran over your trousers . " He drew back from her . " That 's not true at all , " he said . " But there 's no blood , the bone 's not broken ... " " I felt it . I felt the pressure , a pinch , so to speak , at one side of my calf . You think I do n't know when I 'm hit ? Not all hurts show up from outside . You ca n't just stand outside and pass judgment on whether I 've been injured or not . You think I do n't know when a U.S. Government mail truck pins me flat to the pavement ? " " Jesus , " said the mailman . The two old ladies went on their way , and the woman returned to her painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand ; something glittered . " But at least I 've got the key , " he told Emily . " Oh , yes . The key . " He opened the door on the passenger side . " Quick . Jump in , " he said . " Me ? " " Jump in the car . What if the thief comes ? All this racket , this hullabaloo . . . " He waited till she 'd climbed in , and then he closed the door and came around to the driver 's side . " I 've had too much excitement lately , " he told her . " I do n't know why things ca n't go a little more smoothly . " He settled himself with a grunt and leaned forward to fit the key in the ignition . " Now look , " he said . " Another difficulty . " The key would n't go . A second key was already there , and a dangling leather case . " What are these ? " he asked Emily . " They must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm always amazed , " Morgan said , " by how incompetent your average criminal is. "  | " But maybe the car was n't stolen at all , " Emily told him . " How could that be ? " " Maybe you just thought you parked in that other block . " " No , no , " he said impatiently . " That would be ridiculous . " He started the motor , veered out around the mail truck , and headed up the street . It sounded as if he were in the wrong gear . " Come back with me and meet Bonny , " he said . " Oh , Leon will be wondering where I am . And anyway , do n't you have to go to work ? " " I ca n't work today ; I only had an hour of sleep last night . It was Brindle , this business with Brindle . Have you ever heard of such a thing ? Robert Roberts , after all these years ! " Emily hoped he would n't start on Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that those few blocks from Gina 's school had taken hours , days ; she 'd expended years ' worth of energy on them . The sight of Morgan beside her ( humming " I 'm Walkin ' " and tapping the steering wheel , fresh as a daisy , without a care in the world ) made her head ache . But then her apartment building approached . Crafts Unlimited was just opening , and its fluorescent lights were fluttering on and off as if unable to gather strength . The windows above it were dark . You could imagine that the building was nothing but an empty shell . Morgan sailed past , still humming . Emily did n't try to stop him . 2 Emily and Leon had given a good deal of thought to Morgan 's wife  --  to what she must be like , considering the amount of time he spent away from her . He was always dropping in on the Merediths for a visit , mentioning other places he 'd just come from and still others where he was heading afterward . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekends ? For on Saturdays he engaged in his own unique style of shopping . He would travel to the depths of Baltimore and return with unlikely items : dented canned goods , or  | I ; Hobby packages wrapped in brown paper and tied all around with string in a dozen clumsy knots . ( You would think they had n't heard of bagging yet , where Morgan shopped . ) Sundays he went to fairs and festivals . At events where Emily and Leon took their puppets , they might even run into him purely by chance . They 'd look through the scrim at the seated audience  --  no more than a long , low hillock  --  and find him standing at the rear , this sudden jutting peak topped by some outlandish hat , always alone , always brooding over something and puffing on a cigarette . ( But when they came out afterward to take their bows , he 'd be beaming mightily and clapping like a proud parent . ) Winters , when the fairs died down , he 'd go to church bazaars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was never too busy to stop and contemplate the appliqued felt Christmastree skirts or the Styrofoam snowmen with sequin eyes . So who was this Bonny , whom he was so eager to leave ? Maybe she nagged him , Leon said . Maybe she was one of those tight , crimped ladies holding court alone in her careful living room , among the polished figurines that Morgan must n't touch and the crystal ashtrays he must n't flick his ashes into . But Emily did n't think so . Putting together all that Morgan said ( his rush of accidents and disasters , his admiration of the Merediths ' stripped apartment ) , she imagined Bonny as a slattern , in a zip-front housedress and a headful of pincurls . She was n't surprised when Morgan parked his car in front of a well-kept brick Colonial house  --  after all , she 'd known there was money , and slate tiles for the roof  --  but she blinked when she stepped out and found a brown-haired woman in a neat skirt and blouse weeding petunias along the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Morgan said , " Bonny ? " Bonny straightened and wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist . There were a few faint smile lines around her eyes . Her lipstick was a chipped , cracked , glossless red . She looked cheerful but noncommittal ; she seemed to be waiting for Morgan to explain himself . " Bonny , this is Emily Meredith , " Morgan said .  | Bonny went on waiting . " Emily and her husband run a puppet show , " Morgan said . " Oh , really ? " It had n't occurred to Emily that Bonny would n't have heard of her . ( She had heard of Bonny , after all . ) She felt a little hurt . She held out her hand and said , " How do you do , Mrs. Gower . " Bonny shook her hand . She said , " Well , are . . . you here to see Morgan ? Or what ? " " She 's here to see you , " Morgan told her . " Me ? " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen , but then I stole it back , by and by , but still there was so much excitement , what with Robert Roberts and all ... " " You mean , you asked her to come inside the house ? " " Oh ! " Emily said . " Well , of course I do n't want to interrupt your work . " " It 's all right , " Bonny said . " Why do n't you roll down your pants leg , Morgan ? " She turned to lead them up the walk . " But , Mrs. Gower ? " " Stay , stay , " Morgan urged , from a bent position . He flattened his cuff around his ankle . " She 's just surprised . You 've come this far ; stay ! " Emily followed Bonny up the steps . She felt she had no choice , although she would rather have been anywhere else . They passed a clay pot in which herbs were growing ? chives and maybe marjoram or thyme . Emily looked at them wistfully . Under other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been someone she was fond of , but they 'd got started wrong . It was Morgan 's fault . He was so thoughtless and abrupt . She felt irritated by his dishpan-shaped helmet , bounding along beside her . " Notice Bonny 's roses , " he said . It could have been a hint  --  a clue to Bonny 's soft spot  --  but Bonny said , without turning , " How can she ? They 're not blooming yet . " The three of them entered the hall . On the radiator were  | u stack of library books with scummy plastic covers , a watering can , and a box of Triscuits . Emily had to watch her step through a little turmoil of shoes and sneakers , and by then they 'd reached the living room . " Look ! " Morgan said , pouncing on a vase . " This is what Amy made at camp , the summer she was ten . " " It 's very pretty , " Emily said . It was lopsided , and a crack ran down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she lives in Roland Park now . You can meet Mother and Brindle , though . " " Brindle 's out shopping for a wedding ring , " Bonny said . " A ring ! Yes , I 've told Emily all about that . And see , here 's Molly 's picture on the mantel . Is n't she beautiful ? It 's from her school play ; they say she has a talent for acting . I ca n't imagine where she got it . There 's never been an actor in our family . What do you think of her ? Bonny , do n't we still have Jeannie 's wedding album ? " There was something feverish about him , Emily thought . Ile darted around the room , rummaging through various overloaded shelves . Emily and Bonny stood in the doorway watching him . Once they happened to glance at each other , but when Emily saw Bonny 's expression  --  oddly hooded ? she looked away again . " Please , " she told Morgan , " I ought to be going . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you have n't met my mother ! " he said , stopping short . " And I wanted Bonny to get to know you ; I wanted you two to ... Bonny , Emily was in the paper today . " " Was she ? " Bonny said . " Where 's the paper ? Did you throw it out ? " " I think it 's in the kitchen . " " Come to the kitchen . Let 's all go ! Let 's all have some coffee , " he said . He raced away . Bonny straightened from the door frame to follow him , and Emily trailed behind . She wished she could just vanish . She thought of ducking out soundlessly , slipping away before they noticed . She dodged a mobile of homemade paper sailing ships and stepped into the kitchen .  | The counters in the kitchen were stacked with dirty dishes , and several animals ' feeding bowls cluttered the floor . One wall was shingled with yellow cartoons and news clippings and hockey schedules , recipes , calendars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental appointment cards , invitations  --  even someone 's high-school diploma . Emily felt surrounded , flooded . Over by the back door Morgan was plowing through a stack of newspapers . " Where is it ? Where is it ? Did it come ? " he asked . " Aha ! " He held up a paper . He laid it flat on the floor , licked his thumb , and started turning pages . " News . . . editorials . . . crafts revival in Baltimore ! " Peering over his shoulder , Emily saw Leon 's sober face . He seemed to be staring at her out of another world . " Bonny , here 's Leon . Emily 's husband , " Morgan said . " And here 's her daughter , Gina . See ? " " Very nice , " said Bonny , setting out coffee cups . " You know , " Morgan said thoughtfully , " I once looked a little like Leon . " Bonny glanced at the photo . " Like that man there ? Never , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , yes , " he said , " but there 's something about the eyes , maybe ; I do n't know . Or something around the mouth . Or maybe it 's the forehead . I do n't know . " He stood up , abandoning the paper , and pulled out a chair from the table . " Sit down , sit down , " he told Emily . He took a seat opposite , as if demonstrating , and fixed her with an urgent , focused look till she sat too . She felt trapped . The dishes on the counters towered so far above her that she imagined they might teeter and topple , swamping her . A typewriter stood in a puddle of orange juice on the table , with a sheet of paper in the carriage . . . . resolution was passed by a show of hands , she read , and Matilda Grayson requested that ... Bonny placed a carton of cream in front of her and a crumpled sack of Pantry Pride sugar . " Were you working on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Yes , " Bonny said . She handed Emily a cup of coffee and sat down next to her . " Um . . . what do you do for a living , Mrs. Gower ? " " I 'm Morgan 's wife for a living . " " Oh , I see . " " Yes , " Bonny said , " but do you see that it 's a full-time fob ? It keeps me busy every minute , I tell you . Oh , from outside he seems so comic and light-hearted , such a character , so quaint , but imagine dealing with him . I mean , the details of it , the coping , stuck at home while he 's off somewhere , wondering who he thinks he is now . Do you suppose we could n't all act like that ? Go swooping around in a velvet cape with a red satin lining and a feathered hat ? That part 's the easy part . Imagine being his wife , finding a cleaner who does ostrich plumes . Keeping his dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his cronies that I have never ' net  --  Salvation Army burns or astrologists or whatever other awestruck , smitten people he digs up . " Emily set her cup down . " You think I do n't appreciate him . You wonder why he married me , " Bonny said . " No , no , " said Emily . She looked across at Morgan , who seemed unperturbed . He was tipping contentedly in his chair , like a child who is confident he 's the center of attention , and puffing on a cigarette . Twisted ropes of smoke hung around his head . " Emily , " Bonny said . Emily turned to her . " Emily , Morgan is the manager of a hardware store . " Emily waited , but that was the end of it . Bonny seemed to be expecting her to speak . " Yes , " Emily said , after a minute . " Cullen Hardware , " Bonny said . " She knows that , Bonny , " Morgan said . " She does ? " Bonny stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think he 's a . . . rabbi or a Greek shipping magnate ? "  | " No , " Emily said . She decided not to mention how they 'd met . Bonny pressed her fingers to her lips . There were freckles , Emily saw , dusting the back of her hand . After all , she was a pleasant woman ; she gave a little laugh . " You must think I 've lost my mind , " she said . " Crazy Bonny , right ? Morgan 's crazy wife , Bonny . " " Oh , no . " " It 's just that I worried you might have been . . . misled . Morgan 's such a , well , prankster , in a way . " " Yes , I know about that . " " You do ? " Bonny said . She glanced over at Morgan . Morgan smiled seraphically and blew out a whoosh of smoke . " But I think he 's trying to give it up , " said Emily . " Oh , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes so much ingenuity to manage some of that foolishness . . . think what he could accomplish if he used that brain for sensible things ! If he straightened out . If he decided to go straight . " " Not much , " said Morgan cheerfully . " What , dear ? " " There 's not much I could accomplish . What do you imagine I 'd be doing instead ? " " Oh , why . . . just attending to things . I mean , attending to where you belong . " She turned to Emily . " There 's nothing wrong with a hardware store . Is there ? My family 's always done well in hardware ; it 's nothing to be sneezed at . But Uncle 011ie says Morgan 's heart 's not in it . What 's the good of a store , he says , where you have to positively wrest the merchandise from the manager ? Assuming you can find the manager . I tell Uncle 011ie , Oh , leave him alone . Cullen Hardware is not the be-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true that Morgan could get more narrowed in . He does n't know how to say no . He never refuses to be swept along . " " Mostly it 's muscles , " Morgan said . This must have been something he 'd told her before ; Bonny  | rolled her eyes at Emily . Morgan turned to Emily and repeated it . " It 's a matter of muscles , " he said . " I do n't understand . " " A matter of following where they lead me . Have you ever gone out to the kitchen , say , and then forgotten what for ? You stand in the kitchen and try to remember . Then your wrist makes a little twisting motion . Oh , yes ! you say . That twist is what you 'd do to turn a faucet on . You must have come for water ! I just trust my muscles , you see , to tell me what I 'm here for . To drop me into my true activity one day . I let them lead me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a glassblower , " Bonny said , " and a tugboat captain for the Curtis Bay Towing Company , and a Mohawk Indian high-rise worker . And that 's just what I happen to hear ; heaven knows what more there is . " Her lips twitched , as if she were hiding some amusement . " You 're walking down the street with him and this total stranger asks him when the International Brotherhood of Magicians is meeting next . You 're listening to a politician 's speech and suddenly you notice Morgan on the platform , sitting beside a senator 's wife with a carnation in his buttonhole . You 're waiting for your crabs at Lexington Market and who 's behind the counter but Morgan in a rubber apron , telling the other customers where he caught such fine oysters . It seems he has this boat that was handed down from an uncle on his mother 's side , a little bateau with no engine ? " " Engines disturb the beds , " said Morgan . " And I do n't like mechanical tonging rigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my mother 's side is good enough for me , I say . " Bonny smiled at him and shook her head . " You step out for two minutes to buy milk , leaving him safe home in his pajamas , and coming back you pass him on the corner in a satin cap and purple satin shirt , telling four little boys the secret that made him the only undefeated jockey in the history of Pimlico . A jockey , six feet tall ! Why do they all  | believe him ? He never used a crop , you see , but only whispered in the horse 's ear . He whispered something that sounded like a crop . What was the word ? " " Scintillate , " Morgan said . " Oh , yes , " said Bonny . She laughed . Morgan trotted in his chair , holding imaginary reins . " Scintillate , scintillate , " he whispered , and Bonny laughed harder and wiped her eyes . " He 's impossible , " she told Emily . " He 's just . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can imagine he must be , " Emily said politely . She was beginning to like Bonny ( her pink , merry face , and the helpless way she sank back in her chair ) , but she thought less of Morgan . It had never occurred to her that he knew exactly how people saw him , and that he enjoyed their astonishment and perhaps even courted it . She frowned at him . Morgan pulled his nose reflectively . " She 's right , " he said . " I make things difficult . But I plan to change . Hear that , Bonny ? " " Oh , do you , now ? " Bonny said . She stood up to raise the kitchen window . " I do n't know what to make of my garden , " she said , looking out at the yard . " I was certain I 'd planted vegetables someplace , but it seems to be coming up all flowers . " " I mean it , " Morgan said . He told Emily , " She does n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in front of you ? Here 's Emily Meredith ; I brought her home . I brought her to our house . I told her and Leon , both , exactly who I was . I told about you and the girls . They know about Amy 's new baby and the time Kate smashed the car . " " Is that right ? " Bonny asked Emily . Emily nodded . " Well , I ca n't think what for , " Bonny said . " I ca n't think why he bored you with all that . " " I 'm combining my worlds ! " Morgan said , and he raised his coffee cup to Bonny .  | But Bonny said , " There 's a catch to it somewhere . There 's something missing . I do n't understand what he wants . " Emily did n't understand either . She shook her head ; Bonny shook hers . In fact , it seemed that Bonny and Emily were the old friends and Morgan was the newcomer . He sat slightly apart , perched under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face from one to the other while the women watched , narrow-eyed , to see what he was up to .  | Even when Morgan fell asleep , he did n't truly lose consciousness . Part of him slept while the rest of him stayed alert and jittery , counting things  --  thumbtacks , mattress buttons , flowers on a daughter 's dress , holes in a pegboard display of electrical fittings . A plumber came in and ordered some pipes : six elbows and a dozen nipples . " Certainly , " said Morgan , but he could n't help laughing . Then he was competing in a singing contest . He was singing a song from the fifties called " Moments to Remember . " He knew the words , but was unable to pronounce them properly . The ballroom prize we almost won came out the barroom brawl we almost won . His partner was not a good dancer anyway , and in fact they  | were nowhere close to winning . Why ! His partner was Laura Lee Keller , the very first girl he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before the days of " Moments to Remember . " After the prom , he and Laura Lee had driven to the beach with half the senior class and lain kissing on a blanket by the ocean . Still , even now , even after all these years , the sound of the ocean reminded him of possibilities unfolding : everything new and untried yet , just around the corner . He opened his eyes and heard the ocean just a few blocks distant , the very same ocean he 'd lain beside with Laura Lee , but he himself was middle-aged and irritable and so was Laura Lee , he supposed , wherever she was ; and his mouth had a scorched taste from smoking too much the night before . It was six o'clock in the morning in Bethany Beach , Delaware , in the buckling tarpaper cottage they rented from Uncle 011ie every July . Tongue-and-groove walls , painted a dingy blue too long ago , rose high above the swaybacked bed . A tattered yellow shade rustled in the window . ( Where else but near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheap aluminum frame stippled by salt air , the bellying screen as soft and sleazy as some synthetic fabric ? Where else would the screen doors and porches have those diagonal wooden insets at the corners , so that no right angles appeared to exist within earshot of the Atlantic ? ) The room was full of castoffs : a looming wardrobe faced with a flecked , metallic mirror ; a bow-fronted bureau topped with a mended dresser scarf ( every one of the drawers stuck , and several of the cut-glass knobs were missing ) ; a pink shag rug as thin and wrinkled as a bathmat ; and a piecrust table beside the bed with a cracked brown plastic clock radio on the doily at its center . Morgan sat up and switched on the radio . He had just missed the Six O'Clock Sermonette ; Guy and Ralna were singing " What a Friend We Have in Jesus . " Next to him , Bonny stirred and said , " Morgan ? What on earth . . . ? " He lowered the volume a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe , and put it on without look-  | ing in the mirror . Barefoot , in his underpants , he slogged down the hall to the kitchen . Already the air was so warm and heavy that he felt used up . The cottage had four bedrooms , but only three were occupied . His mother slept in the second and Kate , their last remaining child , in the third . It used to be that the place was overflowing . The girls would share beds and couches ; Brindle roomed with Louisa ; various daughters ' boyfriends lined up in sleeping bags out on the porch . Morgan had complained of the confusion at the time , but now he missed it . He wondered what point there was in coming any more . Kate was hardly present  --  she was eighteen years old now , busy with her own affairs , forever off visiting friends in the ugly new condominium south of town . As for Louisa , the trip seemed to shake her memory loose ; she was even more dislocated than usual . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline with a bucket , hunting shells . The bridge of her nose developed a permanent pink , peeling patch . Sometimes she sat at the edge of the breakers and dabbled like a child , with her legs in a V  --  a rash of red on top , pale underneath . Then Morgan would pace the sand just behind her with his thumbs hooked in the waistband of his trunks , braving the sun and the sticky spray , for he was never comfortable when a member of his family was in the water . He considered swimming ( like sailing , like skiing ) to be unnatural , a rich person 's contrivance to fill up empty hours . Although he could swim himself ( a taut , silent breast stroke , with his mouth tightly closed , not wetting so much as the tip of his beard ) , he would never swim just for pleasure . And he would surely never swim in the ocean . His distrust of the ocean was logical and intelligent , he felt . He kept sensibly away from the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He only listened to the breakers , and plummeted into a deep , slow trance where once again he lay with Laura Lee Keller on a blanket beneath the stars . It was too hot for coffee , but he 'd get a headache if he tried to do without it . He made instant , using water straight from  | the tap . Beneath the taste of Maxwell House and sugar he caught the thick , dark taste of beach water , but he drank it anyway , from a jellyglass painted with clowns . Then he rinsed the glass . Then he took Bonny 's purse from the kitchen table and put it in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator . ( Another folly of rich people was their belief that in resort towns , crime does not exist . Morgan knew better . He sensed danger all around , and would have felt more secure in the heart of Baltimore . ) He went back to the bedroom and found Bonny sitting against her pillow . " What are you up so early for ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I wanted to hear the news , " he said . It was n't true ; he never felt the news had anything to do with him . What he 'd wanted was to drown out the sound of the ocean . This was Tuesday . They 'd been here three days . There were eleven days remaining . He sighed and sat on the edge of the bed to pull his socks on . " I 'll bring breakfast from the bakery , " he told Bonny . " Anything you want while I 'm in town ? " " The bakery 's not open yet . " " I 'll go and wait . I 'll buy a paper . It 's too quiet here . " " Well , bring some of those bow-tie things with cherries , then . . . " She yawned and ruffled her hair . A pillow mark ran down her left cheek . " Lucky you , " she said . " You fell asleep right away , last night . " " I had a terrible sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole night long I dreamed , " Morgan said , " and woke , and checked the clock . I ca n't remember now what I dreamed . A man in a tailcoat stepped out of the wardrobe . I think this house is haunted , Bonny . " " You say that every year , " Bonny told him . " Well , it 's haunted every year . " He pulled a striped T-shirt over his head . When he emerged , he said , " All these wakeful nights , peculiar thoughts . . . the most I hope for , from a vacation , is a chance to rest up once it 's over . "  | " Today 's the day my brother comes , " Bonny said , climbing out of bed . Morgan zipped his hiking shorts , which were new and full of pockets and flaps that he had n't yet explored . Attached to one pocket was a metal clasp . It was probably meant for a compass . " I do n't suppose you brought along a compass , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . She was standing before the wardrobe in a short , plain nightgown that he happened to be fond of . I le was even fond of the grapy veins in her calves , and her rumpled knees . He considered slipping up to kiss the pulse in her throat , but then he felt laden by the heat and the waves and the tongue-and-groove walls . " Ah , God . I have to do something about this life of mine , " he said . " What about it ? " she asked , sliding a blouse off a hanger . " It 's come to nothing . It 's come to nothing . " She looked over at him , and parted her lips as if about to ask a question . But then he said , " Bow-tie pastries , right ? With cherries . " He was gone before she could ask whatever it was she had planned . 2 With one hand under his mother 's elbow , he steered her along the boardwalk . It was nearly noon , and she wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunburn . Her striped terry beach robe was long-sleeved and ankle-length , and it concealed not a bathing suit but an ordinary street dress , for she could no more swim than fly , she always said . Her face was pale and pursed , even in this heat , and her fingertips were cold when she touched his arm . She touched his arm to tell him to stop for a second . She wanted to look at a house that was under construction . " What an unusual shape , " she said . " It 's called an A-frame , " Morgan said .  | " Why , it 's practically all garret . " Morgan summoned his thoughts together . At moments like this , when Louisa seemed fully in touch with her surroundings , he always made an effort to have a real conversation with her . " The cost , " he said , " is considerably lower than for other houses , I believe . " " Yes , I should think so , " she said . She patted his arm again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see now . How long have we been here ? " " Three days , Mother . " " Eleven more to go , " she said . " Yes . " She said , " Heavens . " " Maybe our family was n't cut out for vacations , " Morgan said . " Maybe not . " " It must be the work ethic , " he said . " Well , I do n't know what that is . It 's more like we vacation all year round on our own . " " How can you say that ? " Morgan asked . " What about my hardware store ? " She did n't answer . " We 're city people , " Morgan said . " We have our city patterns , things to keep us busy . . . It 's dangerous , lolling around like this . It 's never good just to loll around and think . Why , you and Father never vacationed in your lives . Did you ? " " I do n't recall , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes Morgan wondered if her failing memory for recent events might stem from her failing memory of her husband ; selective forgetfulness was an impossibility , maybe . Having chosen to forget in one area , she had to forget in all others as well . He felt a sudden urge to jolt her . He wanted to ask : am I aging in the same direction my father did ? have I journeyed too far away from him ? am I too near ? what do I have to go on , here ? I 'm traveling blind ; I 'm older now than  | my own father ever lived to be . Instead , he asked , " Did n't you and he go to Ocean City once ? " " I really would n't know , " she said primly . " Jesus ! You 're so stubborn ! " he shouted , slapping his thigh . His mother remained unmoved , but two girls walking ahead in bikinis looked over their shoulders at him . " Do you ever think how I must feel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just been plunked here . I have no one from the old days ; I 'm just a foreigner on my own . You ca n't count Brindle ; she 's so much younger , and anyway so wrapped up in that husband of hers ... " " But there 's always me , " his mother said , picking her way around a toddler with a bucket . " Yes , " he said , " but often you sort of . . . vacate , Mother ; you 're not really there at all . " He had hurt her feelings . He was glad of it only for an instant ; then he felt deeply remorseful . His mother raised her head high and looked off toward someone 's A-frame cottage , where beach towels flapped on the balcony railing . " Why ! " she said . " Was n't that speedy . " " What was , Mother dear ? " " They 've finished construction on the A-frame , " she said . " It seems like no time at all . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter glare . " So it does , dear heart , " he said . Morgan went out to get a pizza for their supper and returned to find that Bonny 's brother had arrived . He 'd brought his new wife , Priscilla , a pretty girl with short , straight blond hair caught back in a silver barrette . They had been married only a few weeks . They wore similar crisp , new-looking white slacks and pastel shirts , like honeymooners . Morgan had n't even met Priscilla up till now  --  or people seemed to assume he had n't , for Billy introduced her and she  | shook Morgan 's hand formally . Bonny said , " Priscilla went to Roland Park Country School with the Semple-Pearce girls , Morgan . " " Oh , yes , " Morgan said , but the truth of the matter was , he could have sworn that Billy had been married to Priscilla once before . He seemed to remember her . He thought she might even have visited this cottage . But she acted as if everything were new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " What a lot of . . . character , " and she walked around the living room fingering the seashell ashtrays like a stranger , and peering at the photograph of Uncle 011ie 's 1934 lacrosse team , and reading all the titles on the Reader 's Digest book condensations . Morgan was cagy ; he went along with it . Then as soon as possible he cornered Bonny , who had taken the pizza out to the kitchen . " Bonny , " he whispered , " is n't that girl an ex-wife of his ? " " No , dear , she 's his present wife . " " But did n't Billy marry her another time , earlier ? " " What are you talking about ? " " I know he did , " he said . " He married her and brought her here ; it was the same time of year . " Bonny straightened up from the oven . She looked hot ; the hair around her temples was damp . She said , " Morgan , I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . " " Jabs ? What jabs ? " " Just because he may have a fondness for one particular type of girl ? " Bonny said . " I 'm not talking types , Bonny . I mean this . He brought her here several years ago and she had that little dog Kelty , Kilty , ... why deny it ? There 's nothing wrong with marrying her twice . Lots of people go back , retrace , try to get it right the second time around . Why cover it up ? " She only sighed and returned to the living room . Morgan followed her . He found Billy and Priscilla on the wicker couch , talking with Morgan 's mother . Billy looked old and foolish in his vivid clothes , with his bald pink skull , his pale hair straggling behind his ears . He had hold of one of Pris-  | cilia 's hands and was stroking it , like something trapped , in his lap . Priscilla was pretending the hand did not belong to her . She leaned forward earnestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took along a thermos of Lipton tea , " Louisa said , " and two nice , juicy nectarines , and a box of arrowroot biscuits that Bonny sometimes buys for my digestion . " Priscilla nodded , her face alight with interest and enthusiasm . She was very young . She could n't possibly have been married several years ago ; several years ago she would still have been a schoolgirl in a royal-blue Roland Park Country School jumper . Morgan felt confused . He sat down in a rocking chair . Louisa said , " Traffic was held up on the Bridge , so we stopped and I got out and sat in the grass by the side of the road . There was a little boy there , just a tot , and I shared one of my nectarines with him and he gave me a nice speckle pear . " " Seckel pear , " Morgan murmured . He could not bear to have her laughed at . " A speckle pear , this one was . I finished half of it and put the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and drove across the Bridge , but in Delaware we stopped again where the Kiwanis Club was barbecuing chickens and I had half a chicken , a Tab , and a sack of potato chips . They were out of bread-and-butter pickles . At Farmer John 's Vegetable Stand ... " Priscilla 's purse was one of those button-on things with a wooden handle . Bermuda bags , he believed they were called . You could button on an infinity of different covers to match different outfits . He would bet that her suitcase was full of covers  --  seersucker pink , yachting blue . . . he lost his train of thought . He wondered what had possessed him to leave his camera at home , hanging by its leather strap in the downstairs closet . For the first time in twenty years he would not have pictures of their vacation . On the other hand , what was the use of such pictures ? They were only the same , year after year . Same waves , same sunburns , same determined smiles .. .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peckish , so I walked to the market with Kate and picked our a watermelon . It was a wonderful melon , really fat and thumpy-sounding , and once we got it back to the cottage all we had to do was touch a knife point to it and it crackled all the way open . But it had no taste . Can you believe it ? Had no taste whatsoever . Such a lovely color and not a scrap of taste . I just do n't understand that , " Morgan 's mother said . Morgan suddenly remembered another of last night 's dreams . He 'd been standing on a lawn beside a beautiful , graceful woman he 'd never seen before . She led him toward a child 's swing hanging from a tree limb . They settled on it ? the woman sitting , Morgan standing , enclosing her with his feet . They started swinging over a cliff . Tiny yellow flowers dotted a field far below them . Morgan knew that when they were swinging high enough , they would leap . He would die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman tipped her head back against him , and he felt the length of her between his legs  --  the curve of her ribcage , the satiny coolness of her clothing . He was like a boy again , trembling . He saw that as long as he felt this way , he wanted to go on living , and all at once he was afraid of the leap . He woke abruptly , with his heart beating so hard that his whole body seemed to vibrate . 4 In the past few years Morgan had become a letterwriter . He could n't have said exactly why . It just seemed , sometimes , that he grew restless and ill-contained ; he could n't sit still ; there was something he wanted to tell someone , but he could n't think what it was and he had no particular person in mind . Then he would sit down and write letters ? although even that was not quite it ; it was only second best . At work , he used his Woodstock typewriter , which produced an uneven , sooty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with two index fingers , stopping after every word or so to pry up the A key , which would n't spring back  | on its own . At home , he wrote with a leaky fountain pen whose cartridge he refilled with a plastic hypodermic needle . ( He 'd salvaged the needle from an emergency-room wastebasket during one of the children 's accidents . Buying cartridges already filled was an extravagance , he felt . ) He wrote all his daughters , even those still living in Baltimore . He wrote the traveling salesmen who came to the store , and his friends Kazari and the Greek tavern-keeper . Because he did not often have anything to say , he gave advice , as a rule . It has come to my attention that your company 's plant-sprayer bottles work exceedingly well for dousing fireplace logs at bedtime . Simply fill the bottle with water , adjust the nozzle to setting 4 .. . Or : Dear Amy , I notice that you appear to be experiencing some difficulty with household clutter . Understand that I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . But as I 've been telling her for years , there is a solution . Simply take a cardboard box , carry it through the rooms , load into it everyone 's toys and dirty clothes and such , and hide it all in a closet . If people ask for some missing object , you 'll be able to tell them where it is . If they do n't ask ( now , here is the important part ) , if a week goes by and they do n't notice the object is gone , then you can be sure it 's non-essential , and you throw it away . You would be surprised at how many things are non-essential . Throw everything away , all of it ! Simplify ! Do n't hesitate ! All my love , sweetheart , Daddy That night , after the others had gone to bed , Morgan sat at the kitchen table and wrote a postcard to Potter , the musical-instrument man . . . . weather has been fair and warm , a high in the 8o 's all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rehoboth I hear they had r % inches of rainfall  | in 47 minutes . . . Yours in Christ , Gower Morgan , S.J. He wrote Todd , his three-year-old grandson , a fine , masculine letter : The new pickup is doing well and the baggage space comes in handy , believe me . Was able to take our entire set of Encyclopedia Britannica to the beach . Now have 15,010 miles on the odometer with the fuel cost per mile being 2.10 and total operating costs per mile being 4.76 ? . If you assume a 30% depreciation each year .. . He addressed the letter to Todd and laid it on top of Potter 's postcard . He sat there blankly for a moment . Then he reached for another sheet of paper . Dear Emily , Leon , and Gina , he wrote . Have been having pleasant weather and temperatures in the 8o 's .. . But it never helped to write the same things over . He crossed the sentence out and wrote , Why not come Friday for the weekend ? Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching there to Highway 404 and then to Highway /8 ... 5 Late Thursday morning Brindle showed up . No one had expected her . Morgan was on the front porch , slouching in a painted rocker and leafing through a volume of the encyclopedia . He happened to glance toward the street and there , just coming to a halt , was the little red sports car that Robert Roberts had given Brindle on their wedding day . Brindle yanked the emergency brake and got out , streaming tears . Her head was swathed in the white chiffon scarf she always slept in to calm her hair down , and she wore some kind of oversized , ankle-length white coat . In fact , she reminded Morgan of an early automobile driver . " Oh , I like that very much , " he told her as she climbed the porch steps . " The veil , the duster . . . " " It 's not a duster , it 's a bathrobe , " Brindle said . She blew her nose in a soggy-looking Kleenex . Crying had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids were shiny and her  | sallow skin had a faint pink glow . She sank into the chair next to Morgan 's and folded her Kleenex to a dry spot . " I got it last week at Stewart 's , " she said . " Sixteen forty-nine , marked down from thirty-two ninety-eight . " " Half-price ; not bad at all , " said Morgan . " Here , dear , have a cigarette . " " I do n't smoke , " she told him . " Have one , sweetheart . It 'll do you good . " He extended the pack and shook it invitingly , but she only blotted her eyes . " I ca n't stand it any more , " she said . " I lo ust have been out of my mind , marrying that . . . tree , that boulder ; all he does is sit there mourning . I ca n't stand it . " " Have a Rolaid . Have a coughdrop . Have some Wrigley 's spearmint gum , " Morgan said . He tore through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television set . Half the time that he pretends he 's watching TV , he 's really watching my photo . I see him clicking his eyes back in focus when I walk into the room . When he thinks I 'm busy with something else , he 'll go over to the photo and pick it up and study it . I'hen he 'll shake his head and set it down again . " Her face fell apart and she started sobbing . Morgan gazed off toward the street . He was n't exactly humming , but he went , " Mm-mm , - mm- mm , " from time to time , and drummed his fingers on his open book . A little boy rode by on a bicycle , tinkling a bell . Two ladies in skirted swimsuits carried a basketful of laundry between them . " Of course , every situation has its difficult moments , " Morgan said . He cleared his throat . Then Bonny came out on the porch . " Brindle ! " she said . " What are you doing here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " Brindle said . She reached out her arms , and Bonny came over to hug her and tell her , " There now , Brindle , never mind . " ( She always knew better than Morgan what to say . ) " Never you mind , now , Brindle . " " It 's getting so I 'm jealous of my own self , " Brindle said , muffled . " I 'm jealous of my photograph , and the silver-plated  | ID bracelet I gave him when I was thirteen . He never takes that bracelet off . He sleeps with it ; he bathes with it . Let it go , ' I feel like saying . Ca n't you ever forget her ? ' He sits in that TV room staring at my photo . . . there 's times I 've even seen tears in his eyes . I say , Robert , talk to me , please , ' and he says , Yes , yes , in a minute . ' " Bonny smoothed a lashing of Brindle 's hair back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but surely this will pass . " " It will never pass , " said Brindle , sitting up and glaring at him . " If it has n't passed in two years , how can you think it ever will ? I tell you , there 's nothing worse than two people with the same daydream getting together , finally . This morning I woke up and found he had n't come to bed . I went down to the TV room and there he was , sound asleep with my photo in the crook of his arm . So I picked up my keys from the counter and left . I did n't even bother dressing . Oh , I was like someone half-crazy , demented . I drove all the way to your house and parked and got out before I remembered you were in Bethany . Do you know that idiot paper-boy is still delivering your papers ? They were everywhere , clear across the lawn . Sunday 's was so old and yellow , you 'd think it was urine-stained  --  and maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're gone , you have every right to sue that paper-boy . You remember what I said . It 's an open invitation to any passing criminal . " " But things started off so well , " Morgan said . " I had so much hope when Robert Roberts first came calling . Ringing the doorbell , bringing you roses ? " " What roses ? He never brought roses . " " Of course he did . " " No , he did n't . " " I remember he did . " " Morgan , please , " said Bonny . " Ca n't you let this be ? " " Oh , very well . But sweeping you into his arms . . . re-member ? " " It was all an act , " said Brindle . " An act ? "  | " If he 'd been halfway truthful , " she said , " he 'd have swept my graduation photo into his arms . And kissed it on the lips . And given it a sports car . " Her chin crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleenex to her mouth . Bonny gazed over Brindle 's head at Morgan , as if expecting him to take some action . But what action would that be ? He had never felt very close to Brindle ; he had never understood her , although of course he loved her . They were so far apart in age that they were hardly brother and sister . At the time of her birth he already had his school life , and his street life , and his friends . And their father 's death had not drawn them together but had merely shown how separate they were . They had mourned in such different ways , Brindle clinging fiercely to her mother while Morgan trudged , withdrawn and stubborn , through the outside world . You could almost say that they had mourned entirely different people . He sat forward slowly , and scratched the crown of his sombrero . " You know , " he said , " I was certain he brought roses . " " He never brought roses , " Brindle said . " I could swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You made those roses up , " said Brindle . She tucked the Kleenex into her bathrobe pocket . " What a pity , " Morgan said sadly . " That was the part I liked best of all . " 6 For lunch he made spaghetti , which was Brindle 's favorite dish . He put on his short-order-cook 's clothes  --  a dirty white apron and a sailor cap  --  and took over the kitchen , while Bonny and Brindle sat at the table drinking coffee . " Spaghetti a la Morgan ! " he said , brandishing a sheaf of noodles . The women merely stared at him , blank-faced , with their minds on something else . " I had hints from the very beginning , " said Brindle , " but I would n't let myself see  | them . You know how it is . Almost the first thing he said to me , that first day he showed up , was . . . he pulled back from me and took both my hands and stared at me and , I ca n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 've kept thinking of you . It 's not as if you 're a beauty , or ever were , ' he said . Also I 'm getting older , ' I told him , and my dentist says my teeth are growing more crooked every year . ' Oh , I never held anything back from him . I never tried to be what I was n't . " Bonny clicked her tongue . " He does n't properly appreciate you , " she said . " He 's one of those people who 's got to sec from a distance before he knows how to feel about it  --  from the past or out of other people 's eyes or in a frame kind of thing like a book or a photo . You did right to leave him , Brindle . " Morgan felt a little itch of anxiety starting in his temples . " But she did n't leave him ; she 's just taking a little holiday from him , " he told Bonny . Bonny and Brindle gazed into space . Probably they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonny 's old college roommate had divorced her husband of twenty-seven years . And of course there were those wives of Billy 's ( every one of whom had left him , some without so much as a note ) and Morgan 's own daughter Carol , who just one week after her wedding had returned , in very good spirits , to settle back into the apartment she 'd been sharing with her twin sister . Also , Morgan knew for a fact that two of Bonny 's closest friends were considering separations , and one had actually spoken with a lawyer . He worried that it was contagious . He feared that Bonny might catch the illness ; or it was more like catching a piece of news , catching on ; she would come to her senses and leave him . She would take with her . . . what ? Something specific hung just at the edge of his mind . She would take with her the combination to a lock , it felt like  --  a secret he needed to know that Bonny knew all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , Morgan was always quick to  | point out the friend 's faults and ulterior motives . " She 's discontented by nature ; any fool can see that . How that poor lunk of a husband ever fell for her . . . Do n't believe a word she tells you , " he would say . Oh , it was women friends you had to watch out for , not men at all but women . He rattled a spatula on a frying pan , trying to claim Bonny 's attention . He did a little short-order-cook 's dance . " Cackles on a raft for Number Four ! " he called . " BLT , hold the mayo ! " Bonny and Brindle gave him identical flat , bemused stares , unblinking , like cats . " Bonny , I do n't see any garlic cloves , " he said , switching tactics . " Use dehydrated . " " Dehydrated ! Dried-out garlic chips ? Unthinkable . " " No one will know the difference . " " I wish you 'd learn to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get organized , Bonny . Keep a list on the door of the fridge and write down whatever item you finish off . " Bonny ran her fingers through her hair . She made it look like some kind of weaving  --  searching out a strand , lacing it into other strands behind her ear . " Here 's what we 'll do , " he told her . " Next week , when we get back to Baltimore , I 'm going to take a pad of paper to the supermarket . I 'm going to map out all the aisles . Aisle one : olives , pickles , mustard . Aisle two : coffee , tea . . . nothing will be omitted . Then you can get it Xeroxed two hundred and sixty times . " Her fingers paused . " How many ? " " Five times fifty-two . Five years ' worth . " She looked into his face . " After five years I 'll make you a new one , " Morgan said . " Things may have changed in the store by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " Bonny said . She threw Brindle a quick , tucked glance , and they smiled at each other . It was a smile so sunny and bland , and so obviously collusive , that all of Morgan 's uneasiness returned . It  | occurred to him that often they must discuss him behind his back . " Oh , you know Morgan , " they must say , rolling their eyes . " You know how he is . " " Well , anyway , " he said , " all I intended was . . . See , if we check items off on this list , shopping would be so simple . Everything would go the way it ought to . Do n't you agree ? " " Yes , yes . " " Should I be the one to get it Xeroxed ? " " No , dear , I 'll do it , " Bonny said . Then she sighed and laughed , in that way she had , and drank the last of her coffee . " For now , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and buy the garlic . " " Never mind ; I 'll use dehydrated , " Morgan said hastily . But she said , " Oh , the walk will do us good . We 'll take your mother , too . " She rose and looked under a stack of magazines . Then she looked in the oven , and finally in the refrigerator . She took out her purse and kissed Morgan . " Anything else you want ? " she asked him . " You could get cream . " " We have cream . " " Yes , but with more people coming tomorrow , and they might be as early as breakfast time ? " " Who might ? " " The Merediths . " " Merediths ? " " At least , I think they might , " he said . " I just dropped them this note , you see , because Brindle was n't here and I had n't known Billy was staying through the weekend . I 'd thought there 'd be enough room . And there will be . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put those sleeping bags ? " " Morgan , I wish you would check with me before you do these things , " Bonny said . " But you like them ! You always say you like them . " " Like who ? " Brindle asked . " Who 're we talking about , here ? " Bonny said , " Oh , the . . . you remember them , Brindle : the Merediths . You 've seen them at the house , several times . Leon  | and Emily Meredith . Well , certainly I like them . I 'm very fond of both of them , you know that , but still ? " " I found them a little dry , personally , " Brindle said . " Her , at least . No , I do n't think she 'd be a barrel of fun at the beach . " " Oh , Emily 's not dry at all , just ? " " And anyhow , " Morgan told Brindle , " I do n't remember asking what you thought . For that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 're in a fine position to criticize my guest list . " " Now , Morgan , " Bonny said . " Oh , well , " said Brindle , " they wo n't come . Do n't worry , Bonny . Emily wo n't like sand . She wo n't like mess . She wo n't want to go into that messy , sticky ocean . I know the type ; they ca n't come to the banquet , " she said . Then she set out with Bonny , so cheered by her own perceptiveness that her face looked peaky and alight with pleasure , and Robert Roberts might never have existed . But they did come . They arrived the next day in midmorning , driving the little black VW that Leon had picked up secondhand . Morgan was not quite adjusted yet to the thought of their owning a car . ( Though if it had to happen , he supposed that this tiny , bell-shaped machine was the most appropriate . And black ; that was a nice touch . Yes , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of transportation ? Maybe they should buy a trailer , as well . ) Morgan stood in the yard , rocking from heel to toe , watching as they parked . Emily got out first , and pulled the front seat forward for Gina . Emily had the wrong kind of shoes on  --  Docksiders . Morgan could hardly believe his eyes . With her black leotard and her flowing black skirt , there was something almost shocking about those cloddy , stiff brown loafers with the white rubber soles . And Gina , when she emerged , wore the squinty , grudging expression of someone  | yanked from sleep . Leon 's face had a clenched look and there was a shaving cut in the cleft of his chin , plastered with a tiny square of toilet paper . No , they were definitely not at their best . It seemed Morgan had only to leave town and they fell apart , rushed ahead without him , tossed aside all their old charm , and invested in unsuitable clothing . ( Leon 's new polo shirt was electric blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan stepped forward , putting on a smile of welcome . " Why ! How nice to see you , " he said , and he kissed Emily 's cheek . Then he hugged Gina and shook hands with Leon . " Have a good trip ? Much traffic ? Bad on the Bridge ? " he asked . Leon muttered something about senior-citizen drivers and jerked the trunk lid open . " It was an easy trip , but I do n't know what the scenery was like because Leon drove so fast it blurred together , " Emily said . " Emily thinks I 'm speeding if she ca n't read all the small print on every billboard , " Leon said , " every road sign and circus poster . If she ca n't count all the fruit in all the fruit stands . " " Well , I did n't notice that patrolman disagreeing with me . " " The fellow 's speedometer was way off base , " Leon said , " and I 'm going to tell them so when it comes to court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk lid shut . " These people just have a quota to fill . They 'll pick up anyone , if they have n't passed out enough tickets that day . " " Ah , well , " Morgan said soothingly . " You got here safely ; that 's what 's important . " He took the suitcase from Leon . It weighed more than he 'd expected . " Come on in the house , " he said . " Bonny ! The Merediths are here ! " He led them up the front steps and into the living room . The house 's smell  --  mildew and kerosene  --  struck him for the first time as unfriendly . He noticed that the cushions in the rattan chairs were flat as pancakes , soggy-looking , and the rattan itself was coming loose in spirals from the arms . Maybe this had n't been such a good idea . Emily and Leon stared  | around uncertainly . Gina slouched near the door and peeled a thumbnail . This was her summer to thin out , it seemed . Her halter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he was suddenly viewing everyone , himself included , in terms of geometry : an ill-assorted collection of knobs and bulges parked in meaningless locations . Then Emily said , " I brought a camera . " " Eh ? " said Morgan . " Oh , a camera ! " " Just a Kodak . " " But that 's wonderful ! " he said . " I left mine at home this year . Oh , it 's wonderful that you thought of it ! " And just then Bonny emerged from the kitchen , smiling , wiping her palms on her skirt . He saw that things would be fine after all . ( Life was full of these damp little moments of gloom that came and went ; they meant nothing . ) He beamed and watched as Bonny hugged everyone . Behind her came his mother , also smiling . " Mother , " he said , " you remember the Merediths . " " Of course , " she said . She held out a hand , first to Leon and then to Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told Emily . " Oh , yes . " " It had the most marvelous glaze on the top . " " Why , thank you , " Emily said . " And did your husband ever recover from his stroke ? " " Excuse me ? " Morgan saw in a flash what must have happened . His mother had Emily confused with Natalie Czernov , a nextdoor neighbor from Morgan 's childhood . Mrs. Czernov had also made fruitcake at Christmas . He was so fascinated by this slippage in time ( as if the fruitcake were a kind of key that opened several doors at once , from several levels of history ) that he forgot to come to Emily 's rescue . Emily said , " This is my husband right here , Mrs. Gower . " " Oh , good , he 's better , then , " Louisa said . Emily looked at Morgan .  | " Maybe I should show you where you 're staying , " he said . He picked up their suitcase again and led them down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and there was a sleeping bag on the floor for Gina . " The bathroom is next door , " he said . " There are towels above the sink . If you need anything else ... " " I 'm sure we 'll be fine , " Emily said . She opened the suitcase . Morgan glimpsed several new-looking squares of folded clothing . Leon , meanwhile , crossed the room abruptly and looked out the window . ( All he would see was a row of dented trashcans . ) Then he moved on to the picture that hung over the bed : a dim blue sea , flat as glass , on which rode a boat made of real shells . " We should n't have come , " he said , peering at a clamshell sail . " Oh , Leon , we need a rest , " Emily told him . " We have to give a puppet show on Monday morning . That means either we fight the Sunday traffic on the Bridge , or we go back at crack of dawn on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord help us if we have a flat or any little tie-up on the way . " " It 's nice to get out of the city , " Emily told Morgan . She removed a camera from the suitcase and closed the lid again . " Leon thought we could n't take the time , but I said , Leon , I 'm tired . I want to go . I 'm tired of puppets . ' " " She 's tired of puppets , " Leon said . " Whose idea were they , I 'd like to know ? Whose were they in the first place ? I 'm only doing what you said to , Emily . You 're the one who started this . " " Well , there 's no good reason we ca n't leave them for a weekend , Leon . " " She thinks we can just leave whenever we like , " Leon told Morgan . Morgan passed a hand across his forehead . He said , " Please . I 'm sure this will all work out . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither Leon nor Emily answered him . They stood facing each other across the bed , their backs very straight , as if  | braced for something serious . They did n't even seem to notice when Morgan left the room . No , it had n't been such a good idea to ask them here . The weekend passed so slowly , it did n't so much pass as chafe along . It ground to a stop and started up again . It rasped on Morgan 's nerves . Actually , this was not entirely the Merediths ' fault . It was more the fault of Brindle , who faded into tears a dozen times a day ; or Bonny , who overdid her sunbathing and developed a fever and chills ; or Kate , who was arrested in Ocean City on charges of possessing half an ounce of marijuana . But Morgan blamed the Merediths anyhow . He could n't help but feel that Leon 's sulkiness had cast some kind of evil spell , and he was irritated by the way Emily hung around Bonny all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who had first discovered her ? ) She had changed ; just wearing different shoes on her feet had somehow altered her . He began to avoid her . He devoted himself to Gina  --  a sad , sprouty child at an awkward age , just the age to tear at his heart . He made her a kite from a Hefty bag , and she thanked him earnestly , but when he looked into her face he saw that she was really watching her parents , who were arguing in low voices at the other end of the porch . He began reflecting on Joshua Bennett , a new neighbor back in Baltimore . This Bennett was an antique dealer . ( Now , there was an occupation . ) He looked like Henry the Eighth and he lived a gentlemanly life  --  eating small , expensive suppers , then reading leatherbound history books while twirling a snifter of brandy . Early last spring , when Bennett first moved in , Morgan had paid a call on him and found him in a maroon velvet smoking jacket with quilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smoking jacket ? ) Bennett had somehow received the impression that Morgan had descended from an ancient Baltimore shipping family and owned an atticful of antique bronzes , and he had been most cordial  | ? offering Morgan some of his brandy and an ivory-tipped cigar . Morgan wondered if Bennett would have accepted an invitation to the beach . He began plotting his return to Baltimore : the friendship he would strike up , the conversations they would have . He could hardly wait to get back . Meanwhile the weekend dragged on . Kate had disgraced the family , Bonny said . Now she was on the police files , marked for life . Bonny seemed to take this very seriously . ( Her sunburn gave her a hectic , intense look . ) Because the cottage had no telephone , the Ocean City police had had to call the Bethany police and have them notify the Gowers . Naturally , therefore , the news would be everywhere now . Saturday , at breakfast , Bonny laid a blazing hand on Louisa 's arm and asked Kate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late husband 's name , which up till now has been unbesmirched . " Morgan had never heard her use the word " unbesmirched " before , and he was n't even sure that it existed . He took some time thinking it over . Louisa , meanwhile , went on calmly spooning grapefruit . " What do you say , Mother ? " Bonny asked her . Louisa peered out of her sunken eyes and said , " Well , I do n't know what all the fuss is about . We used to give little babies marijuana any old time . It soothed their teething . " " No , no , Mother , that was belladonna , " Bonny said . Kate merely looked bored . Brindle blew her nose . The Merediths sat in a row and watched , like members of a jury . And on the beach  --  where the ocean curled and flattened beneath a deep blue bowl of sky , and gulls floated overhead as slow as sails  --  this group was a motley scramble of blankets , thermoses , sandy towels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind flapped past , a squawking radio , and scattered leaves of newspaper . Kate , who had been grounded for the rest of her vacation , flipped angrily through Seventeen . Bonny sweated and shivered in layers of protective garments . The white zinc oxide on her nose and lower lip , along with her huge black sunglasses , gave her the look of some insect creature from a science-fiction movie . Gina dug a hole in the  | sand and climbed into it . Billy and Priscilla made a spectacle of themselves , lying too close together on their blanket . And Emily , in an unbecoming pale blue swimsuit that exposed her thin , limp legs , took pictures that were going to turn out poorly , but she would not yield her camera to Morgan . She worried that he would snap her , she said . Morgan swore he would n't . ( She was already pasted in his mind as he would like her to be forever  --  wearing her liquid black skirt and ballet slippers . He would surely not choose to record this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do , " he told her , " is photograph some groups . Some action , do n't you see . " He could n't bear her finicky delays , the stylized poses she insisted on . Morgan himself was a photographer of great speed and dash ; he caught people in clumps , in mid-motion , midlaugh . Emily picked her way across the sand to one person at a time , stopping every step or so to shake her white feet fastidiously , and then she would take an eternity getting things just right , squinting through the camera , squinting at the sky  --  as if there were anything that could be done , any adjustments at all to aid a Kodak Instamatic . " Be still , now , " she would tell her subject , but then she 'd wait so long that whoever it was grew strained and artificial-looking , and more than once Morgan cried , " Just take it , dammit ! " Then Emily lowered her camera and turned , eyes widening , lips parting , and had to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel about when they were going home . Emily wanted to wait till Monday , but Leon wanted to leave that evening . " Lord , yes , " Morgan longed to say . " Go ! " ? not only to the Merediths but to everyone . They could abandon him on the beach . Fall would come and he 'd be buried under drifting threads of sand and a few brown leaves blown seaward . He pictured how calm he would grow , at last . The breakers would act for him , tumbling about while he lay still . He would finally have a chance to sort himself out . It was people who disarranged his life ? Louisa in her striped beach robe like a hawk-nosed Bedouin , Brindle in an old stretched swimsuit of Bonny 's that fell in  | vacant folds around her hunched body . He sat beneath the umbrella in his sombrero and trunks and his shoes with woolen socks . His bare chest felt itchy and sticky . He chewed a match and listened to the Merediths quarrel . Leon said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their show . Emily said it was only a puppet show . Leon asked how she could say only . Was n't it what she 'd set her heart on , dragged him into , held his nose to  --  damn puppets with their silly grins  --  all these years ? She said she had never held his nose to anything and , anyway , it was Leon 's business what he did with his life . She had certainly not forced him into this , she said . Then Leon jumped to his feet and went striding southward , toward town . Morgan watched after him , idly observing that Leon had developed a roll of padded flesh above the waistband of his trunks . He was a solid , weighty man now , and came down hard on his heels . Flocks of slender girls parted to let him pass . He pushed on through them , not giving them a glance . Possibly , Billy and Priscilla were quarreling too , for they sat apart from each other and Billy drew deep circles in the sand between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained on the outskirts , each alone , stiff-necked . The women 's soft voices wove in with the rush of the ocean . " Look at the birds , " Emily told Gina . " Look how they circle . Look how they 're hunting for fish . " " Or maybe they 're just cooling off their underwings , " Louisa said . Bonny , gazing at the horizon from behind her dark glasses , spoke in a tranquil , faraway voice . " It was here on this beach , " she said , " that I first knew I was a grownup . I had thought of myself as a girl for so long  --  years after I was married . I was twenty-nine , pregnant with the twins . I 'd brought Amy and Jeannie to the beach to play . I saw the lifeguard look over at me and then at some spot beyond me , and I realized he had n't really seen me at all . His mind told him , Lady . Children . Sand toys , ' and he passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever the kind that boys would whistle at . It 's not as if I were used  | to hordes of men admiring me , even back when I was in my teens . But at least , you see , I had once been up for consideration , and now I was n't . I was reclassified . I felt so sad . I felt I 'd had something taken away from me that I was so certain of , I had n't even noticed I had it . I did n't know it would happen to me too , just like to anyone else . " Morgan noticed someone walking toward them : a man in a business suit that was made of some dull gray hammeredmetal fabric . Everyone he passed stared after him for a moment . He ruffled their faces like a wind , and then they turned away again . It was Robert Roberts . Morgan said , " Brindle . " Brindle seemed to comprehend everything , just from the sound of her name . She hunched tighter on her blanket and hugged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Morgan . He rose and spat his match out . " Why , Robert Roberts ! " he said , and offered his hand , too soon . Robert had some distance to travel yet . He came lurching up the slope a little untidily , in order not to keep Morgan waiting . His palm was damp . His face glistened . He was a man without visible edges or angles , and his thin brown hair was parted close to the center and plastered down . It appeared that he was sinking into the sand . There was sand across the creases of his shoes , and more sand filling his trouser cuffs . He gripped Morgan 's hand like a drowning man and stared fixedly into his eyes ? but that was his salesman 's training , no doubt . " It 's Bob , " he said , panting . " Beg pardon ? " " I 'm Bob . You always call me Robert Roberts , like a joke . " " I do ? " " I came for Brindle . " Morgan turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring out to sea . " It 's the same thing all over , is n't it ? " Robert said to Morgan . " It 's the same old story . Once again she leaves me . " " Ah , well . . . have a seat , Robert , Bob . Do n't be such a stranger . "  | Robert ignored him . " Brindle , " he said , " I woke up Thursday morning and you were gone . I thought maybe you were just miffed about something , but it 's been four days now and you never came back . Brindle , are we going round and round like this all our lives ? ' We 're together , you leave me , we 're together , you leave me ? " " You do still have my photograph , " Brindle told the ocean . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Brindle got to her feet . She brushed sand off the seat of her bathing suit ; she adjusted a strap . Then she went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he drew back . " Look , " she said , tapping her yellow cheekbone . " This is me . I am Brindle Gower Teague Roberts . All that string of names . " " Yes , Brindle , of course , " Robert said . " You say that so easily ! But since you and I were children , I 've been married and widowed . I married old Horace Teague next door and moved into his rowhouse ; I bought little cans of ham in the gourmet sections of department stores ? " " You 've told me all that , Brindle . " " I am not the girl in the photograph . " She was not . The skin below her eyes was the same damaged color as Morgan 's . The dimple in one cheek had become a dry crack  --  something Morgan had never noticed . She was thirty-eight years old . Morgan stroked his beard . " Brindle , what is it you 're saying ? " Robert Roberts asked . " Are you saying you do n't love me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gazing politely in other directions ) there was the softest rustle , like a laugh or a sigh . Robert looked over at them . Then he turned to Morgan . " What is she saying ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " said Morgan . Louisa said , " If they marry , I hope I wo n't be sent to live with them . " " They are married , Mother dear , " Morgan told her . " You have no idea how hard it is , " Louisa said , " not knowing where you 'll be shipped to next . "  | " Mother , have we ever shipped you anywhere ? Ever in all your life ? " " Have n't you ? " she asked . She considered , retreating into the hood of her beach robe . " Well , somehow it feels like you have , at least , " she said . " No , I prefer to stay on with you . Bonny , you wo n't let him send me off to Brindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with but . . . eventful , I suppose you 'd say . " " Oh , yes , " said Bonny dryly . " Promise ? " " Mother , " said Morgan . " They 're married . They 're already married , and no one 's shipped you anywhere . Tell her , Brindle . Tell her , Robert , Bob ... " But Robert faced the sea , not listening . His hair blew up stiffly , in spikes , which made him look desperate . While the others watched , he bent to dust the sand from his trousers . He pulled his shirtcuffs a proper length below the sleeves of his coat . Then he started walking toward the water . He circled a child with a shovel and he stepped over a moat and a crenellated wall . But his powers of observation seemed to weaken as he drew nearer the sea , and he stumbled into a shallow basin that three little boys were digging . He climbed out again , ignoring their cries . Now his trouser legs were dark and sugary-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached the surf and kept going . A young man , lifting a screaming girl in the air and preparing to dunk her , suddenly set her down and stood gaping . Robert was knee-deep in seething white water . He was waist-deep . When the breakers curled back for a new assault , he was seen to be clothed in heavy , dragging vestments that looked almost Biblical . Up until now , no one had moved . They might have been little specks of bathers on a postcard . But then Brindle screamed , " Stop him ! " and all the women clambered to their feet . The lifeguard stood on his high wooden chair , with a whistle raised halfway to his mouth . Billy barreled past . Morgan had n't even heard him get up . Morgan threw his  | sombrero into Bonny 's lap and followed , but the lifeguard was faster than both of them . By the time Billy and Morgan hit the water , the lifeguard was in to waist level , heaving his orange torpedo at Robert . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Morgan 's knees , colder than he had expected . He hated the feeling of wet woolen socks . However , he kept going . What he had in mind was not so much rescuing Robert as defeating him . No , Robert would never get away with this ; he could n't escape so easily ; it must not be allowed . Morgan swarmed in the water , his limbs wandering off in several directions . A surprised-looking woman lifted both flaps of her bathing cap and stared . The lifeguard took a stranglehold on Robert from behind , and Robert ( who so far had not even got his hair wet ) flailed and fell backward . He was engulfed by a wave and came up coughing , still in the lifeguard 's grasp . The lifeguard hauled him in . Morgan followed with his arms out level , his head lunging forward intently . The lifeguard dragged Robert up on the sand and dumped him there , like a bundle of wet laundry . He prodded Robert with one long , bronzed foot . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down beside Robert and looked at his ruined shoes . Billy sank next to him , out of breath . Robert went on coughing and shrugging off the people who crowded around . " Stand back , stand back , " the lifeguard said . He asked Morgan , " What was he , drunk ? " " I would n't have the faintest idea , " Morgan said . " Well , I got to make a report on this . " " Really , that wo n't be necessary , " Morgan said , rising . " I 'm from the Bureau . " " The what ? " " Parks and Safety , " Morgan said . " What 's your name , son ? Of course I plan to mention this to the board . " " Well , Hendrix , " the lifeguard said . " Danny Hendrix , with an x . " " Good work , Hendrix , " Morgan said . He briskly shook the  | lifeguard 's hand . The lifeguard stood around a minute , scratching his head , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo float out to sea . They propped Robert up and draped him across their shoulders  --  one arm circling Morgan 's neck , one arm circling Billy 's . Robert seemed uninjured , but he was heavy and lethargic and his shoes dragged behind him . " Come on , fellow , " Billy said cheerfully . He looked pleased ; perhaps he was reminded of his fraternity days , which he 'd once told Morgan were the happiest of his life . Morgan himself stayed silent . He wished he had a cigarette . They hauled Robert past the blanket , where the women were packing their belongings . Brindle was smoothing out towels and folding them . She would not look at Robert . Morgan felt proud of her . Let Robert see whom he was dealing with here ! Let him see how they could handle it  --  all of them together . For this was no mere marital quarrel , no romantic tiff . No , plainly what had happened was a comment upon their whole family  --  on the disarray of their family life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not , listening to Louisa forget where she was in time , Morgan arguing with her , all the others grouping into battle squads . . . and then he 'd made his break , escaped . The scoundrel . He 'd insulted every one of them , each and every one . Morgan felt a flash of anger . Pretending to be concerned about Hendrix , he stopped without warning and ducked away from Robert 's arm and turned toward the ocean . Robert tilted and nearly fell . Morgan shaded his eyes . Hendrix was sending signals to the lifeguard on the next beach . Morgan could not read signal flags , but he could easily imagine the conversation that was taking place . WHAT WAS PROBLEM , the neighbor would ask , and Hendrix would answer , MIXUP CHAOS MUDDLE .. . Kate was watching too . ( No doubt she found Hendrix handsome . ) Morgan said , " Can you tell what he 's saying ? " She shrugged . " It 's just the clear sign , " she said .  | " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in order . " " Little does he know , " Morgan said . Bonny told Morgan they were running out of beds . Were the Merediths leaving tonight or tomorrow morning ? she asked him . This conversation took place in the kitchen , late in the afternoon , while Bonny was emptying ice-cube trays into a pitcher . Above the crackle and clink of ice , she whispered that it would certainly solve a great deal if the Merediths left before bedtime . Then she could put Brindle and Robert in their room . But Morgan did n't think Brindle would want to share a room with Robert anyhow . " Let it be , Bonny , " he said . " Send Robert out on the porch with a sleeping bag . " " But , Morgan , they 're married . " " The man 's a lunatic . She 's better off without him . " " You 're the one who was against her leaving him , " Bonny said . " Now , just because he walks into the surf a ways ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit on . Making us look like some kind of institutional outing , a laughingstock . . . " " Nobody laughed , " Bonny said . " It 's a mark of how badly this vacation is going , " Morgan said , " that , lately , I 've been wondering how the hardware store is doing . " " He was just showing her he cared , " said Bonny . " I 've half a mind to call Butkins in the morning and see if he 's restocked those leaf bags yet . With fall coming on ? " " What are you talking about ? It 's July . " Morgan pulled at his nose . " Go ask Emily what they 've decided , " Bonny said . " You want me to tell them to leave ? " " No , no , just ask . If they 're staying on , we 'll work out something else . " " Maybe we could leave , " he said hopefully . " The others could stay and we could go . "  | Bonny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , where his mother and Priscilla were playing Scrabble . Kate was painting her fingernails at a little rattan table . The smell of nail polish filled the room  --  a piercing , city smell that Morgan liked . He would have preferred to settle here , but he said , " Anyone seen Emily ? " " She 's out front , " Priscilla told him . He went to the porch , letting the rickety screen door slam shut behind him . Emily was taking pictures again . She photographed Gina , who was lining up a row of oyster shells on the railing . She photographed Robert , who sat stiff and humiliated in a rocker , wearing borrowed clothes  --  Billy 's wedding-white slacks and candy-striped shirt . Then she photographed Morgan . Morgan had to stand still for a long , long moment while Emily squinted through the camera at him . He did his best not to show his irritation . At least , he was glad to see , Emily had got out of that swimsuit . She wore her black outfit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful , fairydancer self . As soon as Morgan heard the shutter click , he said , " Now I 'll snap one of you , since you 're looking so fine and pretty . " He came down the front steps and took the camera from her hands . She put up no resistance , for once . She seemed tired . Even when he drew away and aimed the camera at her , she did n't smooth her hair or lighten her expression . He snapped the picture and handed the camera back to her . " Ah . . . Bonny was just wondering , " he said . " Should we count on having you three for the night ? " " I do n't know , " she said . She rolled the film forward with a little zipping sound . " I 'll have to talk to Leon , " she said finally . " Oh ? Where is Leon ? " " He never came back from his walk . I was planning to go into town and look for him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gina ? You want to take a walk ? "  | " I 'm busy , " Gina said , laying out another row of shells . " Robert ? " " I 'm waiting for Brindle . " Morgan and Emily started down the street . It was narrow and patchily surfaced ; they could walk in the center of it without much fear of traffic . They passed a woman hanging out beach towels and a little girl blowing soap bubbles on her steps . The houses were so close together that it almost seemed the two of them were proceeding through a series of roomshearing Neil Diamond on the radio and then an oboe concerto , catching a whiff of coffee and frying crabcakes , watching a man and a boy sort out their fishing tackle on a green porch glider . Emily said , " He 'll have a mighty long wait . " " Who will ? " Morgan asked . " Robert Roberts . Brindle 's gone back to Baltimore . " " She has ? " " Billy drove her to the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked right out front ! " " She does n't want it any more , she said . " " Oh , " said Morgan . He thought that over . " So it 's my house she 's gone to , is it ? " " I did n't ask , " Emily said . " It serves him right , " said Morgan . " Yes , I was on his side till now , the way he rang our doorbell , bringing roses . . . but , oh , this ocean business . No . People imagine they can hold you with such things . They cause themselves some damage and assume that we 'll accept responsibility . But they underestimate us . They fail to realize . No , Brindle will never forgive him for that . " Emily said nothing . He glanced down at her and found her drawn and pale , walking alongside him with her camera held tight in one bluish hand . How had she managed to avoid a sunburn ? She 'd been out on the beach as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve . " Well , " he said , " I suppose you must find us very tiring . Right ? " " I 've had a wonderful time , " she told him .  | " Eh ? " " I 've had a wonderful time . " " Yes , well , that 's sweet of you , but . . . never mind , I know this was n't what you 're used to . There 's no economy to our life . Do n't think I have n't noticed that . " " It was wonderful . It was a real vacation , " Emily said . " As soon as we got your letter , I was so excited  --  I went out and bought us all new clothes . It 's been years since I 've been to the beach . Not since high school . " " Ah , yes , high school , " Morgan said , sighing . " He never thinks we can spare the time . He 'd rather stay at home . We either give our shows or stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite  --  he 's saying , You wanted to marry and settle , did n't you ? Well , here we are , and we 're never going anywhere again . ' It 's funny : I hoped I 'd grow more like him  --  more , oh , active  --  but it seems instead he 's more like me . We just sit home . I sit in that room with that sewing machine ; I feel like someone in a story , some drudge . I feel like the miller 's daughter , left to spin gold out of straw . Visiting here was just what we needed  --  so much going on , so many things happening ? " " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " Morgan said . He felt very uncomfortable , and had forgotten to bring his cigarettes . They passed a man smoking on his front steps and Morgan drew a chestful of sharp gray air from him . " Does n't the sun set differently here , " he said , " so long and level ; the light 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily kept up . They turned east and passed the first of a string of shops . " He puts me in such a position , " she said . " He always makes it seem that everything was my idea , that I 'm the one who organized our lives this way , but I 'm not . I mean , if he just sat , what was I to do ? Tell me that ! " Morgan said , " I honestly do n't believe I can last another day in this place . " " In Bethany ? " Emily asked . She looked around her . " But it 's beautiful , " she said . " It smells of dead fish . "  | " Why , Morgan . " They passed a gift-shop window hung with yellow nets and filled with spiky , varnished conch shells from Florida and pewter sand dollars , seahorses locked in Lucite paperweights , racks of pierced earrings shaped like starfish and dolphins . They climbed a set of weathered wooden stairs , and on the way up the ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holiday House restaurant . " Oh ! My God , " he said . Emily turned to him . " Look ! " he said , feeling his cheeks , peering into the glass . " I 'm so old ! I 'm so ruined ! I seem to have . . . fallen apart . " She laughed . " Well , I do n't see anything funny , " he told her . " Morgan , do n't worry . You 're fine . It 's always like that , if you have n't braced your face first . " " Yes , but now my face is braced , " he said . " And look ! Still ! " She stopped laughing and put on a sympathetic expression . But , of course , he could n't expect her to understand . Her skin seemed filmed with gold ; the metal filings of her hair glinted in the sunlight . She started walking again and after a moment he followed , still testing different parts of his face with his fingertips . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , gazing up and down the boardwalk . " Maybe he stopped at a cafe . " " Oh , he 'd never do that on his own . " This interested him . " Why not ? " he asked . " What would he have against it ? " She did n't answer . She set her hands on the boardwalk railing and looked out at the ocean . It was five o'clock at least , maybe later , and only one or two swimmers remained . A single white Styrofoam raft skated away on the surf . Couples strolled along the edge , dressed in clean , dry clothing that gave them the lovingly tended look of small children awakened from naps . There were flattened squares of sand  | where families had been camped on blankets , and abandoned drip-castles and bucket-shaped towers . But no Leon . " Maybe he 's back at the cottage , " Morgan said . " Emily ? " She was crying . Tears rolled singly down her cheeks while she faced straight ahead , wide-eyed . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . He put an arm around Emily , clumsily , and said what he supposed Bonny might say . " There , now . Never mind , " he told her , and when she turned toward him , he folded her in to him and said , " Never you mind , Emily . " Her hair smelled like fresh linen that had hung to dry in the sun all day . The camera , which she clutched to her chest , made a boxy shape between them , but elsewhere she was soft and boneless , surprisingly slight ; there was nothing to her . He was startled by a sudden ache that made him tighten his arms and pull her hard against him . His head grew light . She made some sound , a kind of gasp , and tore away . " Emily , wait ! " he said . It was difficult to get his breath . He said , " Emily , let me explain , " but she had already backed off , and Morgan was left reeling and hot-faced with shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked down and saw Leon passing below them , absorbed in the evening paper . They lost their good weather on Monday and did n't see the sun again till Thursday , and by then it was too late ; everyone remaining in the cottage was annoyed with everyone else . Billy and Priscilla left early , in a huff  --  Priscilla driving Brindle 's car . Louisa quarreled with Kate about some blueberry muffins , and Bonny told Morgan that he 'd have to take Louisa in the pickup , going home . She certainly could n't travel with the two of them together . But Morgan did n't want to take her . He looked forward to making the trip alone , with an extra-early start and no stops along the way . Then as soon as he reached home , he figured , he would hay a call on Joshua Bennett , the antique dealer . And maybe afterward he 'd wander on downtown , just to see what he 'd  | missed . No , there was n't any room for Louisa in his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing , he threw his encyclopedia into the truckbed . " Goodbye , everybody , " he said , and he left . Traveling down their little street , before he turned onto the highway , he could look in the rear-view mirror and see Kate chasing after him , and Bonny descending the porch steps calling something , and Louisa shading her eyes in the door . In this family , you could never have a simple leavetaking . There were always threads and tangles trailing . He drove slightly over the speed limit , once even swerving to the shoulder of the road to bypass a line of cars . He had only a few minutes ' wait at the Kent Narrows and none at all on the Bridge . Skimming across the Bridge , he felt he was soaring . He reached the city limits at eleven , and was home by eleven-twenty  --  long before Bonny and the others . The yard was overgrown , littered with rolled newspapers . The house was cool and musty-smelling behind its drawn shades , and there was a mountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room Brindle sat playing solitaire . Coffee stains yellowed the front of her bathrobe . She trilled her fingers absently when he walked in , and then she laid a jack of diamonds on a queen of spades . " Pardon my not bringing in the papers , " she said , " but I did n't want to go outside because Robert Roberts was parked in front of the house for most of the week . " " Persisting , is he ? " Morgan said . He sat down next to her to sort the mail . " I could n't even go for milk , or to buy a loaf of bread , so I managed on what was here . Sardines and corned-beef hash , mainly . I feel like someone on a submarine ; I have this craving for lettuce . But it was n't so bad . I did n't really mind . It made me think of back when we were kids , when we were poor . Morgan , " she said , pausing with a ten of clubs in midair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we were up against it ? "  | " As far as I 'm concerned , we 're still up against it , " Morgan said . There was a dainty blue envelope from Priscilla that must contain a thank-you note . It made him tired to think of it . He passed on to a thicker one that looked more promising , and ripped it open . Inside was a sheaf of photographs , wrapped in a letter . He checked the signature : Emily . Now what ? Dear Morgan and Bonny , she wrote , in a neat , italic hand that struck him as stunted . Thank you again for a lovely vacation . 1 hope we did not put you to too much trouble . Toward the end we were so rushed , getting off in time to beat the dark , that I did n't feel we properly said goodbye . But it was so nice of you to have us and we all had such a .. . Morgan grimaced and turned to the photos . He flipped through them idly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laid one on the dining-room table and another one beside it , and another . Bonny , Robert , Brindle , Kate .. . Each person sat alone , suspended in an amber light that surely did not exist in Bethany Beach , Delaware . Bonny folded her arms across her stomach and smiled a radiant smile . Robert Roberts shone like a honeymooner in his borrowed shirt , and Brindle 's skin had the mellow glow of a priceless painting . Kate with her stubborn pout was as sultry and mysterious as a piece of exotic fruit . Morgan 's sombrero , pushed back , was a halo , and the white streaks in his beard gave him the depth and texture of something carved . Well , it was only the film . It was cut-rate film , or out of date , or underexposed . But each person gazed out so steadily , with such trust , such concentration . Emily herself , marble-pale in folds of black , met his scrutiny with eyes so clear that he imagined he could see through them and behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his world must look to her . A buoyant little bubble of hope began to rise in him . Over and over , he sorted through the pictures , rearranging them , aligning them , dropping them , smiling widely and sighing and laughing , ignoring his sister 's astonished stare : a man in love .  | 1 When spring came , Emily started walking . She walked all spring and summer , down alleyways , across tattered rags of parks , through stores that smelled of pickles and garlic . She went in the front doors and out the back , emerging on some unknown street full of delivery trucks , stacked wooden crates , construction workers with pneumatic drills tearing up the pavement . Her ballet slippers , nearly soundless , tripped along in time to the music in her head . She liked songs about leaving , about women who packed up and left , and men who woke to find their beds unexpectedly empty . If you miss the train I 'm on , you will know that I am gone .. . She slipped between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these mornings , it wo n't be long , you 'll call my name and I 'll be gone . . . She brushed against an old lady with a shopping bag full of bottles , did not apologize , kept going . I know you , rider , going to miss me when I 'm . . . Gone , gone , gone : her slippers thumped it out . She had a spiky step to begin with , but every day , all over again , she softened ; she would slow down bit by bit , and wilt , and grow calm . She would think of how Leon 's jacket hung across that broad , subtle curve between his shoulder blades . How complete his words sounded  --  more certain than other people 's , spoken in an even voice that carried some special weight . How he always kept his mouth closed , not tightly clamped but relaxed and gentle , giving her , for some reason , an impression of secrets working within him . She sighed and turned home , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Gower ? a wide leather hat and a tumult of beard , loping along behind her . If she paused till he caught up , he 'd make a nuisance of himself . He had entered some new stage , developed a new fixation . It was harmless , really , but annoying . He might declare himself to her anywhere  --  fling out his arms in the middle of the Broadway Fish Market , beam down at her , full of joy . " Last night I dreamed you went to bed with me . " She would click her tongue and walk away . She would march on out and down the block , cut through an alley past a grinding garbage truck , and he would follow , but he kept his distance . His hat rounded corners like a flying saucer , level and spinning , the rest of him sauntering beneath . Glancing hack , she had to laugh . Then she turned away again , but he 'd already noticed ; she heard him laugh too . Did n't he realize she had problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon , like someone traveling under a cloud . First marching , then drifting , she paced out the knots and snarls of life with Leon . Love was not a comedy . But here came Morgan , laughing . She gave in and stopped once more and waited . He arrived beside her and pointed at the neon  | sign that swung above their heads . " Look ! LaTrella 's Rooms . Weekly ! Daily ! Let 's just nip upstairs . " " Really , Morgan . " And even in front of Leon  --  what did Morgan imagine he was doing ? In front of glowering , dark Leon , he said , " Emily , fetch your toothbrush . We 're eloping . " When there was music , anywhere  --  a car radio passing on the street  --  he would seize her by the waist and dance . He danced continually , nowadays . It seemed his feet could not keep quiet . She had never known him to act so silly . Fortunately , Leon did n't take him seriously . " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Morgan . Still , she said , " Morgan , I wish you would n't joke like that in front of Leon . What must he think ? " " What should he think ? I 'm stealing you away , " Morgan said , and he circled the kitchen , where Emily happened to be washing dishes , and threw open all the cupboards . " Which things are you bringing with you ? These plates ? This bowl ? This two-quart vinyl orange-juice pitcher ? " She rested her soapy hands on the sink and watched him . " Morgan , " she said . " Do n't you ever get self-conscious ? " " Well , " he said . He closed a cupboard door . He stroked his beard . " That 's a very interesting question , " he said . " I 'm glad you asked me that . The fact is . . . ah , yes , I do . " She blinked . " You do ? " " The fact is , " he said , " with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before her , smiling . There was something clumsy about him that made her see , suddenly , what he must have been like as a boy  --  one of those bumbling boys who ca n't think what to talk about with girls ; or who talk too much , perhaps , out of nervousness  --  compulsively relating the entire plots of movies or explaining how the internal-combustion engine works . It was a shock ; she had never pictured him that way . And anyhow , she was probably wrong , for an instant  | later he was back to the Morgan she had always known : a gray-streaked , twinkling clown of a man , swinging into a soft-shoe dance across her kitchen floor . At least he could make her laugh . 2 She walked through summer and into fall . She did other things too , of course  --  gave puppet shows , sewed costumes , cooked , helped Gina with her homework . But at night , when she closed her eyes , she saw a maze of streets and traffic , the way compulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the smallest details of her walks  --  by the clank of a foot on a manhole cover , the spark of mica in concrete , and the Bicentennial fire hydrants sticking out their stunted arms like so many defective babies . She opened her eyes , sat up , rearranged her pillow . " What 's the trouble ? " Leon would ask . There were any number of answers she could give , all true . She said , sometimes , that she thought their marriage had something badly wrong with it , something out of step , she could n't say just what . Maybe so , said Leon , but what did she want him to do about it ? He did not believe , he said , that there was anything in the world that would make her really happy . Unless , perhaps , she could bring the whole solar system into line exactly her way , not a planet disobeying . What was it that she expected of him ? he would ask . She was silent . Or sometimes she said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nine-year-old to act so serious , she said . It broke her heart to see her so unswervingly alert to their moods , watching from a distance , smoothing over quarrels . But Leon said Gina was growing up , that was all . Naturally , he said . Let her be , he said . Also , Emily said , their puppet shows never went well any more . Running through every play was some kind of dislocation  --  characters stepping on each other 's speeches , unsynchronized , ragged , or missing cues and gawking stupidly.  | Fairytales fell into fragments , every line a splinter . When Cinderella danced with the Prince , their cloth bodies clung together , but the hands inside them shrank away . Emily believed that the audience could guess this . She was certain of it . Leon said that was ridiculous . They were making more money than they ever had before ; they had to turn down invitations . Things were going wonderfully , Leon said . In her sleep , she dreamed she walked a revolving pavement like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often , when she had some work that could be done by hand , she 'd spend her mornings down in Crafts Unlimited . She 'd perch on a stool behind the counter and listen to Mrs. Apple while she sewed . Mrs. Apple knew hundreds of craftsmen , all their irregular , colorful lives , and she could talk on and on about them in her cheery way , stringing together people Emily had never heard of . Emily relaxed , expanded , watched well-dressed grandmothers buying her puppets . Once Mrs. Apple 's son Victor came to visit . He was living in D.C. now and had driven over unannounced . He 'd gained a good deal of weight and shaved off his mustache . His wife , a pretty woman with flossy blond hair , carried their small son in her arms . " Well , well , well , " Victor said to Emily , and he hooked his thumbs into the tiny pockets of his vest . " I see you 're still making puppets . " She felt she had to defend herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're much different now . They 're a whole different process . " Getting off her stool , though , going to a table to show him a king with a gnarled face , she was conscious of how dreary she must seem to him  --  still in the same building , the same occupation , wearing the same kind of clothes . Her braids , she felt suddenly , might as well have solidified on her head . She wished she had not let Morgan Gower persuade her to go back to ballet slippers . She wished she had Gina here  --  all t he change that anyone could ask for . Victor bounced slightly on the balls of his feet , examining the king . Melissa , Emily  | thought suddenly . Melissa Tibbett  --  that was the name of the birthday child at their very first show , when Victor had been the doll-voiced father wondering what to bring back from his travels . Melissa must be in her teens by now  --  sixteen years old , at least ; long past puppets . Emily set the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about Leon ? " Victor asked . " Is he doing any act-ing ? " " Oh , well , not so very much . No , not so much at the moment , " she said . He nodded . She hated the understanding way he looked into her eyes . That afternoon she pulled a cardboard box from the closet and unpacked her marionettes . She 'd been experimenting with marionettes for several years . She liked the challenge : they were harder to work . She had figured out her own arrangement of strings , suspended from a single cross of Popsicle sticks . There were two strings for the hands , two more for the knees , and one each for the head and the lower back . ( At fairs she 'd seen double and triple crosses , like biplanes , and half a dozen additional strings , but none of it seemed essential . ) She took a Red Riding Hood , her most successful effort , and went into the living room . Leon was on the couch , reading the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , " Emily said . Leon glanced up . Then he said , " Oh , Emily , not those marionettes again . " " But look : see how easy ? " She pranced Red Riding Hood across the floor , up the couch , into Gina 's lap . Gina giggled . Then Red Riding Hood skipped away , swinging a small yellow basket that snapped cleverly over her arm . " What do you think ? " Emily asked Leon . " Very nice , but not for us , " Leon said . " Emily , our old puppets can do that , and more besides . They can set the basket down and pick it up again . They do n't have all those strings in the way . "  | " Oh , it 's just like with my shadow puppets . You wo n't try anything new , " she said . " I 'm tired of the old ones . " " So ? " he asked her . " You ca n't just switch the universe around , any time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their box . She went for a walk , though she ought to be starting supper . At the corner of Crosswell and Hartley she paused for a traffic light and Morgan Gower came up beside her . He was wearing a tall black suit , a high-collared shirt , and a bowler hat so ancient it looked rusty . He bowed and tipped his hat . She laughed . A grin spread behind his beard , but he seemed to guess her mood and he did n't speak . In fact , when the light turned green he dropped back again , though she was conscious of his presence  --  keeping a measured distance behind , humming a little tune and watching over her . 3 In October , Emily 's second cousin Claire called to say that her great-aunt had died in her sleep . She 'd donated her remains to the cause of medical science , Claire said ( just like Aunt Mercer ; she would put it in just those words ) , but still there 'd be a service at the Meetinghouse . Emily thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Mercer in twelve years  --  not since before her marriage . They had only exchanged Christmas cards , with polite , fond notes beneath the signatures . Going now , of course , was pointless ; but even so , Emily canceled a puppet show and left Gina with Leon and took the Volkswagen south . She was nervous about making the four-hour trip alone , but as soon as she 'd merged on the interstate she felt wonderful . It seemed that the air here was thinner and lighter . She was even pleased by all the traffic she encountered  --  so many people skimming along ! No doubt they were out here day and night , endlessly circling the planet , and now at last she had joined them . She smiled at every driver she passed . She was fascinated by the private , cluttered worlds she  | glimpsed  --  maps and stuffed animals on window ledges ; a passenger sleeping , open-mouthed ; a pair of children combing out their dog . She turned off the interstate and traveled smaller and smaller roads , winding through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shacks bristling with TV antennas , their yards full of trucks on blocks and the hulls of cars , then speeding through coppery woodlands laced with underbrush and discarded furniture . She reached Taney in the early afternoon . The town was still so small that several of the men hunkering before the Shell station were familiar to her  --  not even any older , it seemed ; just painted there , dreamily holding their hand-rolled cigarettes . ( Their names swam back to her : Shufords and Grindstaffs and Haithcocks . She 'd had them stored in her memory all these years without knowing it . ) Autumn leaves scuttled down Main Street . She turned up Erin Street and parked in front of the squat little house that she and her mother had shared with Aunt Mercer . The yard was shadowed by great old trees . No real grass grew there  --  just patchy bits of plantain in the caked orange dirt , weeds trailing out of a concrete urn , and a leaf-littered boxwood hedge giving off its dusky , pungent smell . Where were Aunt Mercer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even this late in the year . Emily climbed the front-porch steps and paused , uncertain whether to knock or to walk on in . Then the door swung open and Claire said , " Emily , honey ! " She had n't changed . She was plump and kind-faced , with little gray curls in a porn-porn over her forehead and another porn-porn at the back of her neck . She wore a stiff , wide , navy-blue dress that barely bent to accommodate her , and heavy black shoes with open toes . " Honey , do n't just stand there . Where 's your little family ? " " I left them home , " Emily said . " Left them ! Came all this way by yourself ? Oh , and we were counting on seeing your sweet daughter ... " Emily could n't imagine Gina in this house . It would n't  | work ; the two would n't meet in her mind . She followed Claire through the hall , with its smell of old newspapers , and into the parlor . The furniture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Emily almost failed to notice the two people sitting on the puffy brown sofa  --  Claire 's husband , Claude , and Aunt Junie , Claire 's mother , the mountainous old woman who also lived here . Neither one was a blood relation , but Emily bent to kiss their cheeks . She 'd last seen them when she came home after her mother 's death , and they 'd been sitting on this very sofa . They might have remained here ever since  --  abandoned , sagging , like large cloth dolls . When Claude reached up to pat her shoulder , the rest of him stayed sunk in the cushions ; his arm seemed disproportionately long and distant from his body . Aunt Junie said , " Oh , Emily , look at you , so grown up . . . " Emily sat on the sofa between them . Claire settled in a rocker . " Did you eat ? " she asked Emily . " You want to wash up ? Have a Coke ? Some buttermilk ? " " I 'm fine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger and less needy than all three of them put together . She folded her hands across her purse . There was a silence . " It 's good to be back , " she said . " Would n't Aunt Mercer be pleased ? " asked Claire . There was a little bustle of motion ; they 'd found their subject . " Oh , would n't she just love to see you sitting here , " Aunt Junie said . " I wish she could have known , " said Claire . " I wish you could have cone before she passed . " " But it was painless , " Claude said . " Oh , yes . It 's the way she 'd have wanted to go . " " If she had to go , well , that 's the way . " Claire said , " All those troubles with her joints , Emily ; you never saw . Arthritis swolled her up so , she got extra knobs and knuckles . Times she had a job just fixing her meals , but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times she could n't button her buttons or dial on the telephone , and Mama with that elbow of hers . . . I would say , Aunt Mercer ,  | let me come over and stay a while , ' but she said , No , ' said , I can do it . ' She just had to do it her way . She always liked to feed that cat of hers herself , said it would n't eat from anyone else , which was only what she liked to believe ; and she was bound and determined to write her own letters . At Christmas  --  remember , Emily ? How she always wrote you , longhand ? And sent a little something for the baby . And Easter , why , that was her day to have us all over , and do every bit herself . Polished the silver , set the table . . . but she had to see to it some time ahead , in case the arthritis , you know .. . I stopped by on Good Friday and there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I said , Aunt Mercer , what 's all this in aid of ? ' I just want to be sure it 's ready , ' she said , for your mama ca n't manage a thing with that elbow and I do like to get organized . ' See , she would never even mention her arthritis . Doctor had to tell us what was what ; said , She is in more pain than she lets on . ' She hated to put us out , never cared to lean on others . In some ways , it was best that she was taken when she was . " " Oh , it was all for the best , " Aunt Junie said . Claude said , " It was a mercy . " " I should have come before , " Emily said . " I never knew . She never mentioned it in her letters . " " Yes , well , that was how she was . " " But she 'd be proud that you came now , " Aunt Junie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surely  --  so many of her nice things that I know she would want you to keep , " Claire said . " I do n't have room in the car , " said Emily . But suddenly she felt she would like this whole house  --  the wallpaper patterned with wasp-waisted baskets of flowers , the carpet always rubbed the wrong way , the china high-heeled slipper filled with chalky china roses . She imagined moving in . She pictured resuming her life where she 'd left off , drinking her morning cocoa from the celery-green glass mug she 'd found in a cereal box when she was eight . And when Claire said , " But her jade bar pin , Emily , that would n't need any space , "  | she instantly pictured the bar pin , streaked with a kind of wood grain and twined at one end with blackened gold leaves . She was amazed at how much was still lodged in her mind . Like the Shufords , the Grindstaffs , and the Haithcocks , Aunt Mercer 's house lived on in Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it out to examine it or not . She would let the bar pin go to Aunt Junie , who wore such things , but in a sense she would continue owning it forever , and she might catch an accidental glimpse of it , barely noticed , some moment while waking or falling asleep fifty years from now . " I do n't have room even for that , " she said . Then she spread her hands and looked down at them  --  the parched white backs of them , the gold wedding ring as thin as wire . At four o'clock they got to their feet and prepared to walk over to the Meetinghouse . Everyone seemed to have a great many coats and scarves , although it was a warm day . They helped each other , like handicapped people . Claire smoothed Claude 's collar for him and straightened his lapels . " Do n't you have a wrap , dear ? " Aunt Junie asked Emily . " Your .. . what is that . . . skirt and top ; it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to take a chill . " But Emily shook her head . Walking up Erin Street , they did meet a few young people , wearing boot-cut jeans and those velvet blazers that were popular in Baltimore too . This town was not so isolated as Emily had imagined . But the Meetinghouse  --  the only Friends Meeting in Taney County  --  was as small and poor as ever , a gray frame cubicle huddled in the back yard of the Savior Baptist Church ; and everyone approaching it was old . They mumbled and clung to each other 's arms , climbing the front steps . Emily hoped to see the friends she 'd gone to First Day School with  --  never more than three or four of them in the best of times  --  but they must have moved away . There was no one under fifty . She took her seat on a straight-backed bench , between Aunt Junie and Claude . She looked around  | the little room and counted fourteen people . The fifteenth entered and closed the door behind him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine is cut off and the sails are raised . In this quiet Emily had grown up  --  not a total silence but a ticking , breathing quiet , with the occasional sound of cloth rubbing cloth , little stirrings , throats cleared , people rustling coughdrop packets or fumbling through their purses . She expected nothing from it . ( She had never been religious . ) She wondered , for the hundredth time , what that dusty red glass was on the ledge above the east window . It was nearly overflowing with something that looked like wax . Maybe it was a candle . She always came to that conclusion . ( But first she thought of something brewing  --  a culture , yogurt , dough , something concocting itself out of nothing . ) She tried to name all the states in the Union . There were four beginning with A , two with C . . . but the M 's were hard ; there were so many : Montana , Missouri , Mississippi .. . An old man with cottony hair rose and stood leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " once walked two and onehalf miles in rheumatism weather to feed my dogs while I was off visiting my sister in Fairfax County . I reckon now I 'll take that cat of hers and tend it , if it do n't get on too bad with my dogs . " He sat down , groped for a handkerchief , and wiped his lips . " Ah , ah , " he said . It made her think of Morgan Gower ; he sometimes said that . She was surprised to remember her other life  --  its speed , its modernness , the great rush of noisy people she knew . She thought of Morgan hurtling down the street behind her ; her daughter ( daughter ! ) hailing a city bus ; Leon tossing coins on the bureau before he undressed . She remembered the first time she ever saw Leon . He had walked in the door of the library reading room , wearing that corduroy jacket of his . He had stood there looking around him , hunting someone , and had not found whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he caught sight of Emily and paused and looked at her again , and then frowned and  | went on out . She had not actually been introduced to him for another week . But now it seemed to her that at his entrance ? swinging through the library door , carrying a single book in his hand ( his fingers fine-textured and brown , his shirtcuffs so perfectly white ) ? her life had suddenly been set in motion . Everything had started up , as if complicated wheels and gears had finally connected , and had raced along in a blur from then on . It was only now , in this slowed-down room , that she had a chance to examine what had happened . Why ! Her mother had died ! Her mother , and she 'd never truly mourned her . She thought of the last time they 'd spoken , on the longdistance phone in the dormitory lobby . ( " It 's raining here , " her mother had said . " But I do n't want to waste our three minutes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? But I do n't want to waste this time on clothes , my goodness . . . " ) She thought about her dormitory room with its two narrow iron bedsteads and the stuffed white unicorn on her pillow . She had once collected unicorns ; she 'd loved them . What had happened to her unicorn collection ? Her roommate must have got it , or Goodwill had come , or it had simply been discarded . And think what else was gone : her favorite books she 'd brought with her to college , her diary , her locket with her only picture of her father in it  --  a young man , laughing . She ached for all of them . She felt they had just this minute been ripped away from her . She thought of Aunt Mercer with her long-chinned , sharp , witty face , her pale , etched mouth always fighting back a smile . It was such a loss ; she was so lost without Aunt Mercer . " When she and I were girls , " Aunt Junie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's lap , " we used to walk to school together . We were the only two girls from the Meeting and we kept to ourselves . Little did I guess I would be marrying her brother , in those days ! I thought he was just a pest . We had these plans for leaving here , getting clean away . We were going to join the gypsies . In those days there were gypsies everywhere . Mercer sent off for a book on how to read the cards , but we could n't make  | head nor tail of it . Oh , but I still have the cards someplace , and the string puppets from when we planned to put on shows in a painted wagon , and the elocution book from when we wanted to take up acting . . . and of course we had thoughts of becoming reporters . Lady news reporters . But it never came to anything . What if we 'd known then how it would turn out ? What if someone had told us what we 'd really do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sat down then , and retrieved her purse from Emily , and closed her eyes and went back to waiting . That evening they had supper at Claire 's  --  casseroles Lit brought over by other members of the Meeting , fruit pies with people 's last names adhesive-taped to the tins . No one ate much . Claude chewed a toothpick and watched a small TV on the kitchen counter . He was an educated man , a dentist , but there was something raw-boned and countrified about him , Emily thought , when he gave his startled barks of laughter at a re-run of " The Brady Bunch . " Claire toyed with a piece of pie . Aunt Junie studied her plate and chewed the inside of her lip . Later , when the dishes were done , they moved to the larger TV in the living room . At nine o'clock Aunt Junie said she was tired , and Emily helped her next door to Aunt Mercer 's , where both of them planned to sleep . " I suppose we 'll have to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the sidewalk . " There is n't much point in keeping up two houses now . " " But where will you live , Aunt Junie ? " " Oh , I 'd move in with Claire and Claude , " she said . Emily thought of something dark , like an eye , contracting and getting darker . There once had been three houses , long ago when Emily 's father was still alive . Aunt Junie shuffled ahead of Emily through the front door . A lamp glowed in the hall , casting a circle of yellow light . " You ought to pick out what you want here , " Aunt Junie  | said . " Why , some of it 's antiques . Pick out what you 'd like to take home . " She leaned on Emily 's arm , and they made their way to the living room . Emily turned a light on . Furniture sprang into view , each piece with its sharp shadow  --  a drop-leaf table with its rear leaf raised against the wall ; a wing chair ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily of a skinny lady in high-heeled shoes . She could have taken all of this , heaven knows . Offered , in general terms , a desk or a sofa , she would have said , " Oh , thank you . Our apartment does seem bare . " A little itch of greed might have started up , in fact . But when she stood in this room and saw the actual objects , she did n't want them . They were too solid , too thickly coated by past events , maybe ; she could n't explain it . She said , " Aunt Junie , sell it . You could surely find some use for the money . " " Take something small , at least , " Aunt Junie said . " Emily , honey , you 're our only young person . You and your little daughter : you 're all we 've got to pass things on to . " Emily pictured Gina reading in the wing chair , twining a curl at her temple the way she always did when she was absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed her teeth ? Did Leon know she still liked a nightlight , even if she would n't say so ? ) She missed Gina 's watchful eyes and her delicate , colorless , chipped-looking mouth  --  Aunt Mercer 's mouth . Emily had never realized . She stopped dead , struck by the thought . Meanwhile , Aunt Junie traveled around the room , holding her crippled arm with her good hand . " This china slipper , maybe . Or these little brass monkeys : hear no evil , see no evil ... " " Aunt Junie , really , we do n't lead that kind of life , " Emily told her . " What kind of life ? What kind of life must it take just to put a few brass monkeys on your coffee table ? " " We do n't have a coffee table , " Emily said , smiling . " Take Mercer 's , then . "  | " No . Please . " " Or jewelry , a watch , a brooch . Pin her bar pin on your collar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emily said . " I only wear these leotards , and they 're made of something knit ; they ca n't be pinned . " Aunt Junie turned and looked at her . She said , " Oh , Emily , your mother sent you off so nice . She read up in Mademoiselle and made you all those clothes for college . She was worried you 'd be dressed wrong . No one else in your class went away to school , none of those Baptists , those Haithcocks and Biddixes . She wanted you to go off nice and show them all , come back educated , settle down , marry someone good to you like my Claire did ; see my Claire ? And she fixed you that sweet paisley dress with the little white collar and cuffs . Now , that you could pin a brooch on . She said you could wear it to Meeting . You said , Mama , I do not intend to go to Meeting there and all I want is blue jeans . I 'm getting out , ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of some big group , not going to be different ever again . ' What a funny little thing you were ! But of course she paid you no mind , and rightly so , as you can see ; quite rightly so . Now , I do n't know what you call this : leotard ? Is that it ? Well , I 'm sure it 's all very stylish in Baltimore , but Emily , honey , it ca n't hold a candle to that paisley dress your mother made . " " That paisley dress is gone , " Emily said . " It 's twelve years old . It 's cleaning windows now . " Aunt Junie turned her face away . She looked stony and blind with hurt . She groped through the furniture  --  chair , desk , another chair  --  and reached the sofa and lowered herself into it . " But of course I wore it , " Emily said , lying . She pictured it still hanging in her dormitory closet , a ghost passed on to each new freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathcart , who vanished one Sunday in April and was never seen again . College authorities are still dragging  | Sophomore Pond . Her spirit is said to haunt the fountain in front of the library . " ) She sat down beside Aunt Junie . She touched her arm and said , " I 'm sorry . " " Oh , what for ? " Aunt Junie asked brightly . " If you like , I 'll take the bar pin . Or something little , anything , or  --  I know what : the marionettes . " " The ? ? " " String puppets is what you called them . Did n't you say you 'd kept them ? " " Yes , " said Aunt Junie , without interest . " Someplace or other , I guess . " " I 'll take one home with me . " " Yes , I recollect now you said you give some kind of children 's parties , " Aunt Junie said . She adjusted her paralyzed arm beneath the shelf of her bosom . " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to help you to bed ? " " No , no , you run along . I can manage . " Emily kissed her on the cheek . Aunt Junie did n't seem to notice . In the room that Emily and her mother had once shared ? such an intertwined , unprivate life that even now she did n't feel truly alone here  --  she untied her skirt and stepped out of her shoes . Her own younger face , formless , smiled from a silver frame on the bureau . She switched off the light , folded back the spread , and climbed into bed . The sheets were so cold they felt damp . She hugged herself and clenched her chattering teeth and watched the same old squares of moonlight on the floor . Aunt Julie , meanwhile , seemed to be moving around in some other part of the house . Drawers slid open , latches clicked . Emily thought she heard the rafters creak in the attic . Oh , this leaden , lumbering world of old people ! She slid away into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearranging the bedroom . " Let 's see , now , if the chair were here , the table here , if we were to put  | the bed beneath the window . . . " Emily sat up once to pull the spread back over her shoulders for warmth . An owl was hooting in the trees . This time when she slept , it was like plummeting into someplace bottomless . She woke and found the room filled with a pearly gray , pre-dawn light . She got up , staggering slightly , and reached for her skirt and tied it around her . She put on her shoes and went out to the hall , which was darker . From Aunt Junie 's room a snoring noise came . Oh , Lord , they would probably all sleep for hours yet . She felt her way to the living room to find her purse , where she 'd stashed a comb and toothbrush . It was on the coffee table . Something knobby poked from it . She turned the lamp on , blinked , and lifted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and hands were plaster , crudely colored . She had a large , faded mouth and two dim circles of rouge . Her black thread hair was in braids . Her tangled strings were tied to a single-cross control bar , just like the one that Emily had invented . Or maybe ( it began to seem ) she had not invented it after all , but had remembered it from her childhood . Though she could n't recall ever having been shown this little creature . Maybe it was something that was passed in the dark through the generations  --  the very thought of giving puppet shows , even . And here she imagined she 'd come so far , lived such a different existence ! She saw her Red Riding Hood scene in a whole new light now , as something crippled . She held the marionette by its snarl of strings . The blue eyes stared at her flatly . The plaster hands  --  one finger chipped ? were suspended in a gracious , stiff position . Out in the kitchen a clock ticked with a muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to walk between chairs and occasional tables . Everything was so stuffed and smothering . She set the marionette on the sofa and picked up her purse and left the room . Fresh air , she thought , might clear her head . She opened the door and stepped out on the porch , where instantly the cold pierced all she wore . But still the stuffy feeling did n't leave her . She descended the steps .  | She went out to the street and stood shivering and looking at the car  --  Leon 's car , compact and gleaming . After a moment she opened the door and slid inside and took a deep breath of its leathery smell . Then she found her keys in her purse . Then she switched the engine on , but not the headlights , and slipped away . In Baltimore it was a crowded , clamorous morning in the middle of the week , with the sun flashing off a sea of metal and everyone honking and darting in and out of lanes . Emily turned down Crosswell Street and parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew from the car and ran inside the building and up the stairs , and then could n't find the proper key and was jingling her way through a ring of them when Leon opened the door . He stood there looking down at her , holding a book in one hand , and she threw her arms around him and pressed her face to his chest . " Emily , love , " he said . " Emily , is something wrong ? " She only shook her head , and hung on tight . 5 Almost daily she had letters from Morgan , whether or not he came in person . Dear Emily , Am enclosing this Sears ad , you really need a pipe wrench and Sears are better than any Cullen Hardware sells . . . For he had taken over the care of their apartment , moving in on the disrepair that lurked in all its corners ; he clanked blithely among the mysteries beneath the kitchen sink . Dear Emily , Came across a hint last night that just might solve that trouble with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a matchbook cover , t " x r " . . . He was the Merediths ' own personal consumer advocate , composing disgusted notes to Radio Shack on his tinny , oldfashioned typewriter , storming into auto-repair shops  --  solving whatever little discontent Emily mentioned in passing . She began to rely on him . Sometimes she said , " Oh , I really should n't ask you to do this ? " but he would say , " Why not ?  | Who would you rather ask instead ? Ah , do n't hurt my feelings , Emily . " Once she had a problem with her tape recorder , the portable recorder she 'd bought to use in their shows . Morgan did n't happen to be around , and while Emily fiddled with the buttons she caught herself wondering , irritably , where was he ? How could he leave her alone like this , to cope without him when he 'd led her to depend on him ? She grabbed up the recorder and ran the several blocks to Cullen Hardware . She arrived breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a customer . " Listen , " she said , jabbing a button . In blew the trumpet for " The Brementown Musicians " ? but blurred and bleary , with some kind of vibration in the speaker . The customer stepped back , looking startled . Morgan sat on his high wooden stool and nodded thoughtfully . " It 's driving me crazy ! " Emily told him , switching it off . " And if you think it sounds bad now , you ought to hear it when the volume 's up , in the middle of a show . You ca n't tell if it 's a trumpet or a foghorn . " Morgan went to a revolving rack for a paintbrush , and he came back and took the recorder onto his lap and slowly , tenderly , brushed the plastic grooves that encased the speaker . Grains of something white flew out . " Sugar , perhaps . Or sand , " he said . " Hmm . " He pressed the button and listened again . The trumpet sound was clear and pure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding up the customer 's purchases . Like a household elf , he left behind him miraculously mended electrical cords , smooth-gliding windows , dripless faucets , and toilet tanks hung with clever arrangements of coat-hanger wire to keep the water from running . " It must be wonderful , " Emily told Bonny , " to have him with you all the time , fixing things , " but Bonny just looked blank and said , " Who , Morgan ? " Well , Bonny had her mind on other matters . She was helping one of her daughters through a difficult pregnancy . The baby was due in February but kept threatening to arrive  | now , in early November ; the daughter had come home to lie flat on her back for the next three months . It was all Bonny could talk about . " When she sits up just a little , to straighten a pillow , " she said , " I have this picture of the baby falling , just tumbling out of her like a penny out of a piggy-bank , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instant , please . ' It 's turning around my view of things . I used to think of pregnancy as getting something ready , growing something to finish it ; now all I think of is holding something back that is going to come regardless . And Morgan ! Well , you know Morgan . Always off somewhere , he really has no comprehension . . . At night he comes home and reads her stories from the operas . He 's taken up an interest in the opera , has he told you ? Such a crazy man . . . Don Giovanni encounters a statue and invites it home to supper , ' he reads . Sounds like something you would do , ' I tell him . He reads on . I believe he thinks that Liz is still a child , in need of bedtime stories ; or maybe he just likes an excuse to read them himself  --  but for day-to-day things ! For bringing trays to her and emptying bedpans ! " Emily nodded gravely . She sympathized with Bonny : he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't Emily who had to live with him . She recalled how odd he 'd seemed when they first knew him  --  his hats and costumes , his pedantic , elderly style of speech . Now he seemed . . . not ordinary , exactly , but understandable . She was beginning to want to believe his assumption that events do n't necessarily have a reason behind them . Last month she and Leon were sitting with him in Eunola 's Restaurant when Morgan glanced out the window and said , " How funny , there 's Lamont . I thought he was dead . " He did n't act very surprised . " That happens more and more often , " he said cheerfully . " I often think I see , for instance , my mother 's father , Grandfather Brindle , walking down the street , and he 's been dead for forty years . I tell myself he might not really have died at all  --  just got tired of his old existence and left to start a new one without us . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be a whole little settlement  --  even a town , perhaps  --  full of people who supposedly died but really did n't . Have you thought of that ? " Then Leon gave a tired hiss , the way he did when Emily said something silly . Well , why should n't there be such a town ? What was so impossible about it ? Emily sat straighter , and looked guiltily into her lap . " The world is a peculiar place , " Morgan said . " Tottery old ladies , people you would n't trust to navigate a grocery cart , are heading two-ton cars in your direction at speeds of seventy miles per hour . Our lives depend on total strangers . So much lacks logic , or a proper sequence . " " Jesus , " said Leon . But Emily felt encouraged ; everything looked brighter . ( This was shortly after she 'd come back from Taney . Morgan 's kind of spaciousness sounded wonderful to her . ) She smiled at him . He smiled back . He was wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sat on his head like a bear cub . He leaned across the table to Leon and told him , " Often I fall into despair . You may find that funny . I seem to be one of those people whose gloominess is comical . But to me it 's very serious . I think , in ten thousand years , what will all this amount to ? Our planet will have vanished by then . What 's the point ? I think , and I board the wrong bus . But when I 'm happy , it 's for no clearer reason . I imagine that I 'm being very witty , I have everyone on my side , but probably that 's not the case at all . " Leon let out his breath and watched the waitress refilling their cups . " Oh , I 'm annoying you , " Morgan said . " No , you 're not , " Emily told him . " Somehow , it appears I am . Leon ? Am I annoying you ? " " Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " Morgan said , " that nothing real has ever happened to me , but when I look back I see that I 'm wrong . My father died , I married , my wife and I raised seven human beings . My daughters had the usual number of accidents and  | tragedies ; they grew up and married and gave birth , and some divorced . My sister has undergone two divorces , or terminations of marriage , at least , and my mother is aging and her memory is n't what it ought to be . . . but somehow it 's as if this were all a story , just something that happened to somebody else . It 's as if I 'm watching from outside , mildly curious , thinking , So this is what kind of life it is , eh ? You would suppose it was n't really mine . You would suppose I 'd planned on having other chances  --  second and third tries , the best two out of three . I ca n't seem to take it all seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " Leon said , rising . But Emily told Morgan , " I know what you mean . " I wish I knew , was what she should have said . His manners were atrocious ( she often thought ) ; he smoked too much and suffered from a chronic cough that would surely be the death of him , ate too many sweets ( and exposed a garble of black fillings whenever he opened his mouth ) , scattered ashes down his front , chewed his cuticles , picked his teeth , meddled with his beard , fidgeted , paced , scratched his stomach , hummed distractingly whenever it was someone else 's turn to speak ; he was not a temperate person . He wore rich men 's hand-me-downs , stained and crumpled and poorly kept , and over them an olive-drab , bunchy nylon parka , its hood trimmed with something matted that might be monkey fur . He smelled permanently of stale tobacco . When he wore glasses , they were so fingerprinted and greasy you could n't read his eyes . He was excitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was kind of him to manage their affairs , the fact was that he could often become . . . well , presumptuous was the word  --  pushy , managerial , bending the Merediths to his conception of them , which was not remotely rooted in reality , taking too much for granted , assuming what he should not have assumed . He talked too much and too erratically , or grew stuffy and bored them with lengthy accounts of human-interest items from the paper , grandchildren 's clever remarks , and Consumer Reports ratings ; while at moments when he should  | have been sociable  --  when the Merediths had other guests , at their Halloween party , for instance  --  he would as likely as not clam up completely and stand around in some corner with his hands jammed deep in his pockets and a glum expression on his face . And his parties ! Well , the less said , the better . Combining garbage men with philosophy professors , seating small children next to priests with hearing aids .. . But once , passing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first successful powered flight , and the sight of Wilbur Wright poised on the sand at Kitty Hawk ? capped and suited , strangely stylish , suspended forever in that tense , elated , ready position  --  reminded her for some reason of Morgan , and she suddenly felt that she had never given him full credit . And another time , when she switched on a cassette tape to see if it were the music for " Hansel and Gretel , " she found that Morgan must have been playing with it , for his gruff , bearded voice leaped forth , disguised in a German accent . " Nu ? Vhere is de button ? " he said , and then she heard a Japanese " Ah so ! " and two clicks , where he must have pressed the button off and on again . " Turn , te-tum , " he said , singing tunelessly , rustling cellophane . There was the sound of a match being struck . He blew a long puff of air . " Naughty boy , Pinocchio ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been untruthful again . Your nose has grown seven inches ! " Then he gave his smoker 's laugh , breathy and wheezing , " Heh , heh , " descending into a cough . But Emily did n't laugh with him . She listened intently , with her forehead creased . She bent very close to the machine , unsmiling , trying to figure him out . 6 She and Leon were invited to the Percy School 's Thanksgiving Festival , where they 'd never been before . She was n't sure what show they should put on . " Rapunzel " ? " Thumbelina " ? Late one afternoon , just a few days before the Festival , she took Rapunzel from her muslin bag and propped  | her on the kitchen table . Rapunzel had not been used for a while and had an unkempt , neglected look . Her long , long braids had grown frazzled . " I suppose I should make her another wig , " Emily told Gina . Gina was doing her homework ; all she said was , " Mmm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 's she doing here ? " " I thought we 'd take her to the Festival . " " Last night you said we 'd do Sleeping Beauty . ' " " I did ? " " I suggested Sleeping Beauty ' and you said that would be fine . " " How could I have ? " Emily asked . " We ca n't give Sleeping Beauty . ' There are thirteen fairies . Not even counting the king , the queen , the princess ... " " I said , Emily , why not let 's do something different for a change ? ' and you said , All right , Leon ? ' " " But never Sleeping Beauty , ' " Emily said . " I said , How about " Sleeping Beauty " ? ' and you said , All right , Leon . ' " He was making it up . Except that Leon never made things up . There was no way Emily could have held that conversation , not even half asleep . Why , if you counted the old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was out of the question . They could n't begin to handle a cast of that size . She considered the possibility that he had discussed the subject with someone else , mistakenly . They always seemed to miss connections these days . They started every morning so courteous , so hopeful , but deteriorated rapidly and ended up , at night , sleeping with their backs to each other on the outermost edges of the bed . She noticed that two vertical grooves had started to appear in Leon 's cheeks . They were not so much lines as hollows , such as you would see in a man who habitually kept his jaw set too far forward . Then he said , " How about taking Gina ? She could work some of the fairies . "  | " But it 's on Wednesday afternoon , " Emily said . " Gina would still be in school . " " Oh , I do n't mind missing school , " Gina said . Emily suspected she was only trying to keep peace . Gina loved school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Mama . " " And thirteen fairies ! Even if we owned that many , how would just one more pair of hands help run them all ? " " We could bring them on a few at a time , maybe , " Leon said . Emily started pacing around the table . Gina and Leon watched her . Gina chewed a pencil and swung her feet , but Leon stayed motionless . Then Emily wheeled on him and said , " Are you doing this on purpose ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " I mean , is this supposed to prove something , Leon ? Are you just trying to show me I 'm . . . oh , set in my ways ? You want me to say I refuse to give a play with eighteen puppets in it , and my daughter playing hooky , and that will mean I 'm rigid , narrow-minded ? " " All I know is , I said , How about " Sleeping Beauty , " Emily ? ' " " You never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of the room . Emily looked over at Gina , who was watching , but Gina abruptly stopped chewing her pencil and buried herself in her homework . Then Emily took her coat from the hook in the hall and left the apartment , jabbing her arms into her sleeves as she stalked down the stairs . It was late enough so the smell of different suppers had begun to fill the stairwell : cabbage , green peppers , oil  --  stifling smells . Crafts Unlimited was already dark and dead-looking . She slammed out into the street . Twilight had drained the color from the buildings . An old woman paused on the corner to set down all her bundles and rearrange them . Emily swerved around her , keeping her fists  | knotted in her coat pockets . She crossed against a red light and walked very fast . He was impossible . There was no hope for either of them . She had locked herself in permanently with someone she could n't bear . She passed a boy and girl who were standing in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her heels and giving the boy a shy smile . It was heartbreaking . She would have stopped to set them straight , but of course they would n't believe her ; they imagined they were going to do everything differently . She met a child , some friend of Gina 's . " Hello , Mrs. Meredith . " " Hello , urn , Polly , " she said  --  motherly , matronly , indistinguishable from any other woman . Sometimes she thought the trouble was , she and Leon were too well acquainted . The most innocent remark could call up such a string of associations , so many past slights and insults never quite settled or forgotten , merely smoothed over . They could no longer have a single uncomplicated feeling about each other . Then she heard footsteps behind her . They kept coming . She slowed , and the corners of her mouth started turning up without her say-so , but when she looked back it was no one she knew  --  a man on his way to someplace in a hurry . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass her . Then she looked back again . But no matter how long she stood watching , the sidewalk was empty . She took a right on Meller Street and walked with more purpose . She crossed another street and turned left . Now there was a stream of people bundled up , intent , rushing home to supper . It occurred to her that Cullen Hardware might be closed by now . She slowed , frowning . But no , its windows were still lit with that faded light that always seemed filmed by dust . She pushed through the door . Butkins was bent over a sheet of paper at the counter . " Has Morgan gone home ? " she asked him . Butkins straightened and passed a hand across his high fore-  | head . " Oh . Mrs. Meredith , " he said . ( He was so determinedly formal , though she 'd known him for years . ) " No , he 's up in his office , " he said . She headed down an aisle of snow shovels and sidewalk salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board whined beneath her feet . On the landing , Morgan 's office seemed unusually still  --  no sawing , hammering , drilling , no flurry of wood chips . Morgan was lying on the maroon plush sofa . He was hatless , for once , and wore a satin-lapeled smoking jacket that very nearly matched the sofa . His hair looked flat and thin . His face was a pale glimmer in the dusk . " Morgan ? Are you sick ? " Emily asked . " I have a cold , " he said . " Oh , just a cold , " she said , relieved . She took off her coat and laid it on the desk . " Just a cold ! How can you say that ? " he asked her . His energy seemed to be returning . He sat up , indignant . " Do you have any idea how I feel ? My head is like a beachball . This morning I had a temperature of ninety-nine point nine , and last night it was a hundred and one . I lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't do both , " Emily said . " Lie awake , and dream as well . " " Why not ? " he asked her . He always had to throw his whole self into things  --  even into illness . His office looked like a hospital room . A Merck Manual lay open on the filing cabinet , and his desk was a jumble of medicines and cloudy drinking glasses . On the floor beside the couch were a bottle of cough syrup , a sticky teaspoon , and a cardboard box spilling papers . She bent to pick up one of the papers . It was a photograph of the oldest , homeliest washing machine she 'd ever laid eyes on , the kind with a wringer attached . Model so4A , she read , can easily be connected to any existing . . . She replaced the paper and sat down in the swivel chair at the desk . Morgan sneezed . " Maybe you ought to be home in bed , " she told him . " I ca n't rest at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat  | on her back trying to hang on to that baby . She gets the wicker breakfast tray ; I end up with the tin meat platter . And people have already started arriving for Thanksgiving . " Butkins called something . Morgan said , " Eh ? " " I 'll be going now , Mr. Gower . " " He ought to know I ca n't hear a thing with this cold , " Morgan told Emily . " He says he 's going , " Emily said . " Do you want me to help lock up ? " " Oh , thank you . It 's true that I 'm not myself . " But he went on sitting there , blotting his nose with a handkerchief . Emily heard the front door shutting behind Butkins . " When Butkins leaves the store , " Morgan said , " I sometimes wonder if he dematerializes . Ever thought of that ? " She smiled . He watched her soberly , not smiling himself . " What 's wrong ? " he asked . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose is white . " " It 's nothing . " " Do n't lie to me , " he said . " I 've known you nine years . When the tip of your nose is white , something 's wrong . It 's Leon , I suppose . " " He thinks I 'm narrow-minded , " Emily said . Morgan sneezed again . " He thinks I 'm rigid , but he 's the one . He never tries out for plays now , and that gospel-troupe man is still after us but Leon wo n't even talk to him . I 'm getting claustrophobic . I ca n't drive after dark any more because the space is too small ? you know , the lighted space the car travels in . I think I must be going crazy from irritation , just from little petty nameless irritations . Then he says that I 'm the one who 's narrow . " Morgan shook a cigarette from an unfamiliar green pack . " See ? We 'd better elope , " he said . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are all right . They 're menthol . " He lit up and started coughing . He stumbled to his feet , as  | if reaching for more air , and wandered around the office , coughing and thumping his chest . Between gasps , he said , " Emily , you know I 'm always here for you . " " You want some Robitussin , Morgan ? " He shook his head , gave a final cough , and settled on his desk top . Medicine bottles clinked all around him . Emily wheeled her chair back slightly to allow him more room . His socks , she saw , were translucent black silk , and he wore pointy black patent-leather slippers that reminded her of Fred Astaire . He was sitting on her coat , rumpling it , but she decided not to point that out . " I know you must find me laughable , " he told her . " Oh , well , I would n't say laughable , really ? " " But I 'm serious , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He slid off his desk , disentangling himself with difficulty from her coat , which had somehow twisted itself around one of his legs . Emily stood up . ( What did he have in mind ? ) He was , after all , a grown man , real , lean-bodied . The hunger with which he drew on his cigarette caused her to step behind her chair . But he went on past her . He was only pacing . He walked to the railing , looked over the darkened store below him , and walked back . " Of course , " he said , " I do n't intend any harm to your marriage . I admire your marriage very much . I mean , in a sense , I love Leon as well , and Gina ; the unit as a whole , in fact . . . Who is it I love ? But you , Emily ... " He flicked his ashes onto the floor . " I am fifty-one years old , " he said . " You 're , what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your father . What a joke , eh ? I must look ridiculous . " Instead he looked sad and kind , and also exhausted . Emily took a step in his direction . He circled her , musing . " I think of you as an illness , " he said . " Something recurrent , like malaria . I push the thought of you down , you see . Whole weeks go by . . . I imagine that I 'm somehow deeper when I manage to overcome it . I feel stronger and wiser . I take some  | pleasure , then , in doing what I 'm supposed to do . I carry the garbage out ; I arrive at work on time ... " She touched his arm . He dodged her and went on pacing , head lowered , puffing clouds of smoke . " I persuade myself , " he said , " that there is some virtue in the trivial , the commonplace . Ha ! What a notion . I think of those things on TV , those man-in-the-street things where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask if he can sing a song , recite a poem . . . they stop a motorcycle gang . I 've seen this ! Black-leather motorcycle gang and ask , Can you sing all the words to " Some Enchanted Evening " ? ' And up these fellows start , dead serious , trying hard  --  I mean , fellows you would never expect had heard of Some Enchanted Evening . ' They stand there with their arms around each other , switchblades poking out of their pockets , brass knuckles in their blue jeans , earnestly , sweetly singing . . . " He 'd forgotten all about her . He was off on this track of his own , tearing back and forth across his office . Emily sat down on the couch and looked around her . There was a bulletin board on the wall above the filing cabinet , and it was covered with clippings and miscellaneous objects . An Adlai Stevenson button , a frowsy red feather , a snapshot of a bride , a blue silk rose . . . She imagined Morgan rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private war , and tacking them up , and chortling , and rushing out again . She was struck , all at once , by his separateness . He was absolutely unrelated to her . She would never really understand the smallest part of him . " They stop this fat old lady , " he was saying . " A mess ! A disaster . Gray and puffy like some failed pastry , and layers of clothes that seem to have melted together . Can you sing " June Is Bustin ' Out All Over " ? ' they ask , and she says , Certainly , ' and starts right up , so obliging , with this shiny grin , and ends with her arms spread and this little stamp-stamp finish ? " He bit down on his cigarette and stopped his pacing long  | enough to demonstrate  --  both hands outflung , one foot poised to stamp . " Just . . . because . . . it 's JUNE ! " he sang , and he stamped his foot . " I love you too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He paused . He took the cigarette from his mouth . " Eh ? " he said . She smiled up at him . He tugged his beard . He shot her a sidelong glance from under his eyebrows , and then he dropped his cigarette and slowly , meditatively ground it out with his heel . When he sat on the edge of the couch , he still seemed to be thinking something over . When he bent to kiss her , he gave off a kind of shaggy warmth , like some furred animal , and he smelled of ashes and Mentholatum.  | Morgan 's daughter Liz finally , finally had her baby , on the coldest night in the coldest February anyone could remember . It was Morgan who had to get up and drive her to the hospital . Then of course her husband , Chester , arrived from Tennessee , and when Liz was released from the hospital , she and Chester and the baby stayed on in her old room a few days till Liz was strong enough to travel . Meanwhile the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amy and Jean kept stopping by with their children , and the twins drifted in from Charlottesville , and Molly and her family from New York , and by the time Kate arrived  | with her boyfriend , there was nowhere to put the boyfriend but the storeroom on the third floor , underneath the eaves . This was on a weekend . They 'd be gone by Monday , Morgan reminded himself . He loved them all , he was crazy about them , but life was becoming a little difficult . The daughters who had n't got along in the past did n't get along any better now . The new baby appeared to be the colicky type . And there was never any time to see Emily . " If we feed the children in the kitchen , " Bonny said , counting on her fingers , " that makes sixteen grownups in the dining room , or fifteen if Lizzie wants a tray in bed , but then the mothers would have to keep running out to check on them , so maybe we should feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing around like wild things while we were trying to eat , and I just remembered , Liz said her old college roommate was coming at seven-thirty , so we ca n't eat too late , or maybe she meant she was coming for supper ; do you think so ? and in that case we 'd be seventeen at table , assuming Liz does not want a tray in bed , and naturally she would n't if her roommate 's eating downstairs , but we only have service for sixteen ; so we 'll have to divide it up , say you and me and Brindle and your mother in the first shift and then the girls and their husbands and . . . oh , dear , David is Jewish , I think . Is it all right I 'm serving ham ? " " Who 's David ? " Morgan asked . " Katie 's boyfriend , Morgan . Pay attention . This is really very simple . " Then after supper one of the grandsons either broke a toe or did n't break a toe , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes required no splints anyhow , so there was n't much point in troubling a doctor outside office hours . Actually , Morgan would not have minded driving the boy to the hospital , which by now he could have found in his sleep . He needed air . The living room was a sea of bodies  --  people reading , knitting , wrestling , quarreling , playing board games , poking the fire , lolling around , yawning , discussing politics . The shades had not been drawn , and the darkness pressing in  | made the house seem even murkier . Louisa 's black Labrador , Harry , had chewed a Jiffy bag into little gray flecks all over the carpet . Morgan went upstairs to his bedroom , but two toddler girls were standing at the bureau trying on Bonny 's lipstick . " Out ! Out ! " he shouted . They lifted their smeared faces to him like tiny , elderly drunks , but they did n't obey . He left , slamming the door behind him . In the hall he was hit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He heard the baby fussing in an edgy voice that clawed at the small of his back . " It 's too much , " he told this what's-his-name , this David , a thin , studious young man who was just descending the third-floor stairs with a paperback book in his hand . David was too polite to say anything , but there was something about the way he fell in with Morgan , going down the next flight of stairs , that made Morgan feel he sympathized . Bonny was walking the baby in the entrance hall , which seemed to be the only space left . " Could you take Pammy for a while ? " she asked him . " Pammy . Ah . The baby . " He did n't want her , but Bonny looked stretched and gray with fatigue . He accepted the baby in a small , warm , wilted clump . No doubt she would spit all over the shoulder of his pinstriped , head-of-the-family suit that he always wore for these occasions . " Bonny , I think we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Now , Morgan , you always tell me that . Then the next day after they leave you wander through the house like a dog that 's lost its puppies . " " Yes , but every visit there are more , you see , " he said , " and they seem to hang around for a longer spell of time . " Molly came through from the kitchen , carrying a bucket . " Christopher 's thrown up , " she said . " How does the world strike you so far ? " Morgan asked the baby . The doorbell rang . Bonny said , " Who can that be ? " " It must be Liz 's roommate . "  | " Morgan , honestly . Liz 's roommate is sitting in the living room . " " She is ? " " She just had supper with us , Morgan . " Morgan opened the door , one-handed . Emily stood waiting . She landed in his vision like a pale , starry flash of light . He felt everything around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She smiled at him . She was holding a package tied with pink yarn . ( In some illogical way , it seemed the gift was for him . It seemed she was the gift . ) Then Bonny said , " Emily ! " and stepped forward to kiss her . Emily looked at Morgan over Bonny 's shoulder . Grave as a child , she drew away and turned to him and patted the baby 's bare foot . " She 's beautiful , " she said . She was gazing into his eyes . The baby had been cranking up to cry again , but gave a sudden hiccup and fell silent  --  taken aback , maybe , by the icy wind from the door , or by the touch of Emily 's cold hand . " Come on inside , " Bonny told Emily . " You must be frozen ! Did you drive ? Have you ever seen such weather ? " She led Emily into the living room . Morgan followed . He felt that Emily was the single point of stillness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . There was something wonderfully prim about the way she offered her package to Liz , as if she were n't sure it would be accepted . But Liz was already exclaiming as she took it . ( Motherhood had enlarged her , fuzzed her edges ; she was a flurry of bathrobe and milky smells . ) And of course she loved the lamb puppet inside . Everyone had to pass it around and try to work it . The lamb 's quilted face was nuzzled to the baby 's cheek . The baby started and batted the air with both fists . " Offer Emily a drink , will you ? " Bonny told Morgan . Morgan stooped to lay the baby in Louisa 's lap . Louisa took her uncertainly , one gnarled hand still clutching a glass of port . " What is this ? " she asked . " It 's a baby , Mother . "  | " Is it mine ? " He reconsidered , took the baby back , and gave her to Brindle . Brindle was reading a mail-order catalog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby looked better entertained than she had the whole day . " She 's the image of Liz , " Emily said . " Is n't she ? She 's just like her . But with Chester 's eyes . " " Emily , honey , where 's Leon ? " Bonny asked . " And where 's Gina ? Did n't she want to see the baby ? " " She has a science report due Monday . She 's been working on it all weekend . " Morgan imagined the hush in their apartment : the bare , clean living room , Gina concentrating on a single book . " But Leon , at least , " Bonny said . " You could have brought Leon . " " He wanted to watch this program on TV . If I waited till it was finished , the baby would have gone to bed , I figured . " Two years ago the Merediths had bought a small television set . Morgan tended to forget that . Every time Emily referred to it , he mentally blinked ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to the sideboard and poured her a glass of sherry  --  the only drink she 'd ever been known to ask for . When he handed it to her , she was just slipping out of her coat . " Let me hang that up , " he told her . " Oh , I 'll keep it . I can only stay a minute . " She sat on the couch , talking to Bonny and Liz , and Morgan harumphed his way around the living room . He stepped over a Monopoly game , threw another log on the fire . He wound the clock on the mantel . He squatted , grunting , and picked up the discarded paper from Emily 's gift and folded it carefully for future use . She must have decorated the paper herself , or bought it from Crafts Unlimited . It was patterned with a block print of little bells . He loved her old-time , small-town manners  --  her prompt gifts and cards and thank-you notes , her Christmas fruitcake , her unfailing observance of every official occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A while back , she had angled a night away from
