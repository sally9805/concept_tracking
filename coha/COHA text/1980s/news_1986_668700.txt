You wouldn ' t know it from the wildly enthusiastic reception she received from the faithful Thursday night at the Rosemont Horizon , but these are not the best of times for Pat Benatar . It ' s only two weeks into the singer ' s current tour and her new album , " Seven The Hard Way , " is already on its way down the pop chart after a relatively disappointing showing , considering Benatar ' s previous track record . And while the main floor was filled for the singer ' s Thursday night show , there were plenty of empty seats in the balcony . Maybe the public is tired of tough cookies , or at last this particular cookie ' s brand of toughness . When she burst on the rock scene in 1979 , Benatar boasted an impressively wide vocal range ( she originally studied opera ) but a notably narrow emotional one . Her hits of the early 1980s , such as " Hit Me With Your Best Shot , " tended toward shrill vengeful songs which invariably viewed romantic love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macho . Any woman who puts up with more than a modicum of unacceptable behavior from a man , of course , should have her head examined . But why not just leave the lout instead of taunting him to " Hit ( you ) With His Best Shot " ? In fairness to Benatar , her stage show has become somewhat less of a one- note affair in the last couple of years , at least as far as belligerence goes . Thursday night ' s set included several slower numbers , including " Run Between the Raindrops , " as a change of pace , and Benatar has traded her skin- tight Spandex pants for a pair of baggier trousers , jacket and a beret which plays up her gamin quality . Still , the singer hasn ' t eased up all that much . On a set which featured an imaginative arrangement of descending light banks and a large numeral seven ( as in " Seven the Hard Way " ) , Benatar spent most of her time in the full throttle mode . A little of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes for a long , shrill vein . Benatar , incidentally , sounded uncomfortably hoarse during her occasional comments between songs . Given her all-out vocal style , though , it was difficult to tell whether she was having throat problems or whether the hoarseness is just an unfortunate consequence of the way she throws herself so zealously into her job . Joe Lynn Turner , former Rainbow vocalist , now fronting his own band , opened the show with a set of entertaining , if not particular original , rock songs from his solo debut album . Kenny Rogers update : Singer Kenny Rogers , who canceled a number of his shows following throat surgery , now is scheduled to perform March 16 at the Rolemont Horizon as originally planned . The date will be the singer ' s first performance after resuming his concert tour . On stage : The McLain Family Band , the American Tradition Bluegrass Band , Ray Kennedy &; the Lonesome River Boys and Kenney Stone &; the Kinfolk perform Feb. 22 at Heights Banquets , 620 S.
