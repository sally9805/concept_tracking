At Marshall Field 's in Chicago , hundreds of disappointed customers placed orders at $195 each for out-of-stock introductory kits of Glycel , a new line of skin-care products . In Las Vegas , caustic-tongued but delicate-skinned Comic Joan Rivers complained that the local Neiman-Marcus was out of Glycel supplies . In New York City , Maryanna Mangino was luckier ; she managed to walk out of Saks Fifth Avenue with $300 worth of assorted Glycel lotions and potions . " I guess I 'm hoping for something mysteriously new that just might work to get rid of wrinkles , " said Mangino . " After all , who ever thought you could put a heart back into somebody else 's body ? " <P> Her question is not an idle one . Beaming down approvingly on the crowds at Glycel counters and from glossy magazine ads at would-be customers is the image of a handsome , clear-eyed man  --  not a hunky male model , mind you , but an even more potent lure : Dr. Christiaan Barnard . The South African surgeon who performed the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co-developer of a patented GSL ingredient , the key to " rejuvenating " skin in Glycel products . Barnard 's endorsement is the latest and most successful wrinkle in the lucrative skin game . Introduced only last month , Glycel has already topped $5 million in sales . The famed surgeon 's involvement has also proved controversial . Declares Dermatologist Albert Kligman of the University of Pennsylvania , who has consulted for a rival manufacturer : " It 's one huge piece of hype , and the motive is an ancient one : money . " <P> The stakes are admittedly high . " Skin care is becoming hotter and hotter in the U.S. , " says John Ledes , editor of the industry newsletter Cosmetic World . Consumers handed over $1.2 billion last year for various pricy cleansers , scrubs , gels , emulsions , foams and masks that promise to give the skin a healthy , rosy glow . The healthy , rosy sales glow is expected to continue with perhaps as much as a 13% increase this year , thanks to a steadily aging population , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadened product lines . As night cream follows day , one thing in the best-selling new prestige lines leads to another . " You do n't just get a one-shot , one-bottle solution to facial problems , " notes Ledes . " You develop a regime . " <P> To push their treatments , manufacturers have buffed up an old gambit : the scientific slant . Names , and often prices , are suggestive of proprietary drugs : Estee Lauder 's Prescriptives , L'Oreal 's Biotherm and Revlon 's European Collagen Complex . The list of ingredients in many concoctions would make the witches of Hampstead Heath envious , from plant extracts like soybean and avocado oil to miracle chemicals . In May , Shiseido will introduce a 24-hour cream , BH 24 , containing biohyaluronic acid . La Prairie boasts that its Cellular Wrinkle Cream has proteins from the placentas of black sheep ( because they are so resistant to disease , explains the manufacturer ) .
