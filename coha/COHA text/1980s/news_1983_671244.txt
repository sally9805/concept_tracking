Still , one important step remains to ensure that the first game , between Georgia and U.C.L.A. , will be televised as scheduled on Sept. 3 . The N.C.A.A. must obtain a stay from the 10th United States Circuit Court of Appeals , which had declared the contracts between the N.C.A.A. and CBS and ABC void . David Cawood , the assistant executive director of the N.C.A.A. , said the association hopes to receive a stay this week . If it does not , it can ask the Supreme Court for a stay. // The contracts were declared void as a result of a lawsuit filed by Georgia and the University of Oklahoma , which belong to the College Football Association and were seeking the freedom to negotiate their own contracts . The N.C.A.A. appealed the ruling , and last week the Court of Appeals refused to rehear the case . Thus , the governing body for collegiate athletics decided to take its case to the Supreme Court . Had the N.C.A.A. already exhausted all its appeals and lost this case , then a scramble , not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conferences sought to strike their own deals with the networks for this season . Even those schools opposed to the N.C.A.A. ' s total control over television contracts have misgivings about a possible free-for-all with no guidelines. // " It ' s a late hour to think of alternatives , " said Neal Pilson , president of CBS Sports . " But we are planning to have a schedule on the air in 1983 even if the current plan is thrown out. " // The N.C.A.A. has been negotiating television contracts for its membership for 30 years and is preparing to enter the second year of a four-year package with CBS and ABC . Two years ago , however , the College Football Association , which comprises major conferences such as the Big Eight , the Southeastern , the Southwest and the Atlantic Coast as well as prominent independents such as Penn State , Pittsburgh and Notre Dame , mounted the first challenge to the N.C.A.A. ' s authority in this area , stating that universities had the right to market their own product . The C.F.A. signed a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expulsion from the N.C.A.A. The contract was not implemented , as the C.F.A. decided to pursue the matter in the courts. // What the networks and the N.C.A.A. say they fear is oversaturation and the possible regional conflicts that could affect attendance . For instance , a popular football-playing school such as Alabama might be able to negotiate a contract with an independent network , or with affiliates of CBS or ABC , to televise its games throughout the South . Road games could be shown on an over-the-air network , with home games made available on cable and pay television . Football fans in the South who normally attend local games involving major powers , as well as those who go to games between smaller schools , might choose to stay home and watch Alabama play Tennessee. // Pilson said that teams with strong regional or national appeal would place affiliates in the position of turning their back on the package offered by the network . The CBS affiliate in Birmingham most likely would compete for Alabama ' s games instead of showing a typical network game , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ' re national networks , and we sell our business to a national audience , " he said . " And unless we had 90 percent of our affiliates , we wouldn ' t have a national package . " <> A lthough the N.C.A.A. permits its members to negotiate individual team and conference contracts in basketball , it points out that problems can be avoided because the sport is played every day of the week . " It ' s difficult not to compare basketball and football , but they are two different entities , " said John Toner , president of the N.C.A.A. and athletic director at the University of Connecticut . " In the Big East , for instance , we try to protect our schools by playing our television games on nights when the others aren ' t playing. // " And if some people in football want to decontrol the sport , it ' s interesting how others are calling for some controls in basketball . They ' re upset that just a few conferences are getting the lucrative contracts. " // Pilson said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ratings winner if more than two games were televised on Saturday . The tentative C.F.A.-NBC contract called for a number of night games , an arrangement which would have created a third game on some Saturdays. // Chuck Neinas , commissioner of the C.F.A. , said that his organization , which now has formed a coalition with the Big Ten and Pacific Ten Conferences , does not aspire to overthrow the N.C.A.A. or place college football in a state of anarchy . He dismisses the charge of oversaturation , pointing to the lucrative $1 billion contract ABC and NBC signed with major league baseball for a game of the week , despite generally poor ratings and the fact that nearly every team makes most of its games available on a combination of local and cable television. // H e pointed to the sunrise-to-sunset visibility of the National Football League and the continued growth and popularity of college basketball , which he thinks is because rather than in spite of the number of games on television . Some observers suggest that this conflict between the C.F.A. and N.C.A.A. is now just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last January to allow Division I-A schools to negotiate their own contracts in the future . But Neinas said it is a matter of schools ' rights and good business. // " Schools like Oklahoma and Georgia are not interested in dealing autonomously , " he said . " We have analyzed this as closely as anyone , and our objective is producing an innovative and exciting product that will benefit the public . We want to expose our product at a time for the best exposure. " //
