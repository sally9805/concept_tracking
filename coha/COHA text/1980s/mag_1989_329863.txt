Before last week 's unexpectedly close Virginia contest , Pollster Harrison Hickman got revealing results by making an offbeat correlation . When white voters were questioned by white pollsters , Hickman found , they favored Republican Marshall Coleman by 16 points . But when whites were telephoned by interviewers with recognizably black intonation , they leaned to Douglas Wilder by 10 points . <P> The fact that Americans are notoriously unreliable when answering questions related to race was dramatically evident in the Virginia and New York City elections . Although several surveys in the final fortnight gave Wilder and David Dinkins comfortable leads ( as high as 15 points for Wilder and 18 points for Dinkins ) , both contests turned out to be squeakers . <P> The phenomenon is not new : seven years ago , Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley seemed to be leading in California 's gubernatorial election  --  until the ballots were counted and he lost by less than a point . Some whites were reluctant to admit to pollsters that they planned to vote against a black . <P> Racism in the crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickman says . Rather , some respondents succumb to a misguided urge to give answers they think will please the questioner . Whatever the reason , pollsters in black-white contests should learn to take the discrepancy into account  --  at least until such racial match-ups cease to be novelties.
