Carter promises Cubans a haven , but the problems keep growing <P> The early signals from the U.S. Government had sounded uncertain , even hostile . But last week Jimmy Carter finally struck a clear note that reaffirmed America 's long history of providing sanctuary to those " huddled masses yearning to breathe free . " Declared the President : " Ours is a country of refugees . We 'll continue to provide an open heart and open arms to refugees seeking freedom from Communist domination and from the economic deprivation brought about by Fidel Castro and his government . " <P> Yet as dangerously crowded boats continued bringing Cuban refugees into Key West , Fla. , the incoming tide rose to nearly 31,000-and the words of welcome from Washington hardly solved the near chaos created by the sudden influx . How many more Cubans would follow , nobody seemed to know-speculation ranged wildly upward to a quarter of a million , even to 1 million-and that raised the difficult question of whether there are practical limits to the number of refugees the U.S. can take in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials mobilized an impressive reception . In less than a week , a city of 161 tents , each holding 30 refugees within its 18-ft. by 52-ft. space , sprang up at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhandle . Long rows of cots completely jammed two 150-ft. by . 240-ft. aircraft hangars , which normally shelter such fighters as the F-15 and F4 . With a dormitory and gymnasium also opened to the newcomers , the base alone held nearly 10,000 refugees . Tall pines were being felled to make room for even more temporary housing . <P> As the chartered airliners arrived from Key West , the weary refugees streamed off with an empty look in their eyes . They carried all the belongings they owned , stuffed in plastic bags and pillowcases . Some shied away from the military trucks and soldiers at first ; they had been told back home that they would be mistreated in the U.S. But when a smiling airman in an Air Force van tossed out bags each containing a sandwich , a hardboiled egg , a carton of milk and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children had never seen an apple before . <P> In South Florida , more than a dozen smaller shelters were opened at sites ranging from two former Nike missile bases to the inside corridors of Miami 's Orange Bowl . The largest processing center was at Tamiami Park , on the outskirts of Miami , where 1,500 refugees a day plodded through a seven-step process to be cleared for release to join relatives who had fled Cuba years ago . All the while , more kept landing at Key West , to be bused from dockside to Key West Naval Air Station . There up to 5,000 waited , both inside and on surrounding concrete aprons of a huge airplane hangar , for other buses to Miami or airplanes to Eglin . <P> The tedious waiting in hot and crowded quarters tested tempers beyond the breaking point . Fights broke out when some of the refugees claimed they had spotted Castro spies in their midst . More jostling occurred when refugees scrambled to get on the buses for Miami . National Guardsmen locked arms to push back 400 trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a megaphone : " You waited 21 years to come to America . Now you can wait four hours for a bus .
