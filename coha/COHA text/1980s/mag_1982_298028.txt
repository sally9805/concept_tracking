The popularity of handcrafted wood furniture is booming <P> The first impulse is to touch . People like to feel the sensuous smoothness of hand-worked wood and trace the grain with their fingers . Handmade wood furniture , says George Nakashima , 77 , the foremost master of the craft , " seems the second life of a tree . " <P> Nakashima and a growing number of followers enhance this second life by working with , nature rather than imposing willful shapes , let alone metal , paint or varnish on their material . They carve the natural color , grain , burls and organic forms of selected wood into useful and , with luck , beautiful objects-such as stools , tables , cabinets , desks , lamps and beds . <P> Interest in handmade furniture has developed into what Paul J. Smith , director of the American Craft Museum in New York City , calls " a cultural phenomenon . " There are at least 5,000 first-class wood-furniture makers in workshops scattered from Alta Loma , Calif. , to New Gloucester , Me . Young professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern , now buy one-of-a-kind pieces in art galleries or directly from the artisans . They may pay as little as $60 for a stool and more than $5,000 for a large table from a master like Nakashima . For many purchasers , handmade furniture , augmented by hand-woven fabrics and carpeting , provides a welcome alternative to the sort of homes that look more suited to either the wearing of powdered wigs or the hosting of group therapy sessions . <P> The furniturewrights are often people who have left other , more remunerative occupations after discovering a special satisfaction in creative carpentry . Sam Maloof , 66 , of Alta Loma , one of the best of them , was a graphic artist before he took up chisel and plane . Glen Gordon , 39 , of Chicago , dropped out of the University of California at Berkeley and wrote poetry . Phyllis Bankier , 35 , of Milwaukee was a schoolteacher . " Most independent craftsmen put in far more hours than people employed by someone else , " says Kenneth Strickland , 32 , who teaches woodworking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purchase and is president of the newly organized Society of American Woodworkers . The society has some 200 active members and a mailing list of about 4,000 . Says Nakashima , a former architect : " The large number of young people , many of them college graduates , who want to do truly fine work is astonishing . Perhaps this is a backlash to industrialism and commercialism . " <P> Born in Spokane , Wash. , Nakashima looks as plain and sturdy as the untreated boards of rare wood in his lumber sheds in New Hope , Pa . Trained in International Style architecture , Nakashima went to Japan in 1934 " to find and touch the creative roots of tradition , " as he puts it in his recently published The Soul of a Tree : A Woodworker 's Reflections ( Kodansha International ; $52 ) . But after seven contemplative years in the Far East , he felt " an instinctive resistance to withdrawing from life . " He returned to the U.S. and eventually set up shop in the rolling woods of eastern Pennsylvania .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
