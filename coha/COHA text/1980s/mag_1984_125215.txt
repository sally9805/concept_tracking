At the University of Wisconsin they 're called lumberjacks  --  big , reticent , unheralded kids who come down from the North Woods in flannel shirts and boots and go wild on the football field . David Greenwood , the Michigan Panthers ' All-USFL strong safety and transcendent athlete , was a lumberjack when he arrived in Madison as a freshman in 1979. // Born and raised in Park Falls , Wis. ( pop . 3,246 ) , which lies 60 miles south of Lake Superior at the western edge of the Chequamegon National Forest , Greenwood himself did n't know how good an athlete he was . He had won the state scholastic high jump championship four years in a row , and in his senior year he 'd also won the long jump and high hurdles titles . His basketball team had gone to the state finals twice , and as a senior he had batted .508 as a pitcher , catcher and third baseman on the Park Falls High baseball team . All in all , he had won 12 varsity letters . But Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors . And its football team was terrible . // " When I went to Wisconsin I was n't looking too far into the future , " says Greenwood . " I certainly was n't thinking about the pros . There were a lot of things I did n't know about . I mean , I 'd never even seen a black person until my basketball team went to the state tourney. " // Not too many blacks had seen a white person like Greenwood , either . While on his recruiting trip to Madison , Greenwood joined a group of black varsity football players who were dunking basketballs in the campus gym . At 6 ' 3 " and 190 pounds , he seemed too short , muscular and pale to keep the pace . But when the players started getting " tricky , " Greenwood let loose . He showed them his standing two-handed dunk , his behind-the-head dunk , his two-balls-at-once dunk . He did n't tell them he had once hit the backboard with his face while warming up for a high school game . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must be half black , ' " says Greenwood . " I was good friends with the black players from then on . " // Greenwood started at safety for the Badgers for four years , leading the team in interceptions three times and earning All-Big Ten honors twice . He also punted for three seasons , setting a Wisconsin record for most career punts ( 185 ) while averaging 37.8 yards per kick . In track he high-jumped 7 ' 2 " and won the Big Ten outdoor title as a junior . He also set the school record in the decathlon ( 6,893 points ) in a brief , and reckless , career as a decathlete . Head football coach Dave McClain called him " the best pure athlete we 've ever had . " The late Dan McClimon , his track coach , called him " a leftover lumberjack from prehistoric days . " // When the Panthers made Greenwood their first pick in the first round of the inaugural USFL draft last year , a reporter asked coach Jim Stanley why the team had chosen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure he can save more games than anybody would win , " said Stanley . // What he had correctly divined was that the entire USFL would be weak in the secondary and that a great safety could make a big difference . " I think a bona fide defensive back is the hardest thing there is to draft , " says Stanley . " And I think Greenwood is the best safety in the league . If you count the NFL , he 's right up there with them  --  if he 's not the best . " // Certainly Greenwood was a force in Michigan 's drive to last year 's USFL championship . In a critical June game against Washington he recovered a fumble , deflected four passes and blocked a field-goal attempt to help preserve a 27-25 Panther win . In the playoff and championship games he had 10 tackles , two assists , two deflections and an interception . // " He 's as big and tough as a linebacker , which makes his blitzes effective because he can go right through a blocker , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can jump , you do n't fret as much when the ball 's in the air because he 's got a chance to get it . " Against Arizona this season , Greenwood leaped high above the Wranglers ' All-USFL wide receiver , Trumaine Johnson , to make a last-minute interception in the end zone and lock up a 31-26 Michigan victory . // Panther defensive back-field coach Dick Roach has his own sense of Greenwood 's value . " I do n't think jumping ability is that big a deal , " he says . " What a strong safety has to do is play the run like a linebacker , drop deep like a safety and cover man-to-man like a corner . Those are three difficult tasks . The reason you like a guy like Greenwood , who can do those things , is that he does n't limit what you can do with the rest of your defense . If your strong safety ca n't cover or ca n't support , then a linebacker or corner has got to help him , and that 's a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted to have Greenwood on their side , though free safety John Arnaud , who was a high jumper at Iowa State ( 7 ' 2 " ) , has one minor complaint . " On our two-deep zone , sometimes I 'll jump for a ball down the middle and so will Greenie , and we 'll hit in midair , " he says . " The guy 's so big that it 's scary . So now if I see him coming , I have to think about backing off . I can imagine how receivers must feel . " // Molly Greenwood , who was born the week the Michigan Panthers opened their 1983 training camp , stands giggling in front of her father , who 's seated in the den of the family 's Bloomfield Hills duplex . David 's wife , Julie , stands beside Molly . Julie , 23 , and David , 24 , were sweethearts back in Park Falls and got married before Greenwood 's senior year at Wisconsin . // " Touchdown , Molly ! " yells Julie . And the 14-month-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gim me five , Molly " says David , and she pats his outstretched palm . // " High five ! " says David , and she raises one hand and slaps skin . // The Greenwoods are a happy football family at a charmed time . The large , sunny condo lacks furniture in a couple of rooms , but nobody seems to mind . Just having all that space is a novelty . Julie was one of four children ; David was the eighth of Perry and Laura Greenwood 's 11 ; and roominess was n't something they grew up with . David , whose father drove a fuel truck for years and now does maintenance work at the Park Falls cemetery , shared three bedrooms and a hallway with his five brothers , while his five sisters slept in one large room . " We always had food on the table , and I always had clothes , " David says . " But , yeah , it was sort of crowded . " // The liberating effect of space overwhelmed Greenwood one night after a recent Panther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Julie , " and I went upstairs , and there were David and his uncle hitting golf balls across the empty living room . Real golf balls . " // Everything happened fast for the Greenwoods  --  from the January 1983 signing ( $800,000 for four years ) to Molly 's birth , to the move to suburban Detroit , to their entrance into a new economic stratum  --  and they 're still sorting things out . // " One day you 're poor and in college , and the next day you have $100,000 in your account , and the day after that somebody says you owe $50,000 in taxes , " says Julie . " You have to make important decisions fast , and you 're always thinking about the future . It 's nice , but it 's not the glamorous life everybody thinks it is . As David says , we 're just average , middle-class people living in the 50 percent tax bracket . " // Greenwood smiles bemusedly as his wife speaks . Where he 's reserved and subtle of wit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family 's finances , not only because she once worked in a stockbroker 's office but also because David does n't care much about such things . " Coming from where I did , well , I 've always said I can live with it or without it , " he says . // A lot of people lived without it in Park Falls , though money did n't seem to matter much in the muskie fishing capital of the world . " You could just about live off the land if you wanted to , " says Greenwood . The Greenwood house was n't deep in the forest , however . It was in town , and David Greenwood spent most of his time playing games with his brothers and neighborhood kids , most of whose parents worked for the local pulp mill . // " My dad worked as hard as anybody , " says Greenwood . " Especially in the winter when people needed a lot of oil . He 'd be up before dawn and would n't get home till eight or nine . " Cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Greenwood . " He 's got a lot of people under him . " // Greenwood was back in Park Falls last winter and got talked into an ice-fishing excursion with some relatives . The boredom of waiting for spring-loaded rod tips to pop up became too much , however , and the men decided to play football to pass the time  --  with a frozen fish as ball . Typical of the sport , the game ended with an injury . Greenwood sent his cousin long : The cousin lost his concentration on Greenwood 's pass , and the rock-hard , spiraling walleye opened a gash in his head . // But now that Greenwood has put Park Falls behind him , he wants full value for his services . Because he signed with the Panthers before the 1983 NFL draft , he was n't taken until the eighth round by the NFL New Orleans Saints . Projected as a second-round NFL pick , Greenwood has improved his stock since then . // " I signed with the USFL because they came up with a deal I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money . But now with the NFL fighting back , things have gone nuts . I know my body will only last so long , so I 'll go wherever the contract is best . It 's as simple as that . " // Though the Panthers and Saints own Greenwood 's rights in the respective leagues for the next two seasons , lately Greenwood 's agent , Greg Campbell , has been shopping his client with other clubs , particularly the L.A. Raiders . " David is a Raiders kind of player , " he says . " I think he was born in a black-and-silver delivery room . " // Campbell 's current asking price for Greenwood is a $1 million bonus up front and $1.5 million over three years . Of course , says Campbell , " That 's today . I 'm afraid to say about tomorrow . " // " Sure it 's crazy , " says Greenwood of the figures . " I can imagine Steve Young breaking down after signing his huge contract . It will break anybody down . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon , and now he can afford seven wives . " // If Greenwood is a Raiders kind of guy , it 's because of his intensity , a competitive drive that has been with him since he was a kid . // " Our whole family was athletic and competitive , " says oldest brother Mike , 33 , a foreman in a lumberyard . " But Dave also was a little bit of a show-off . When he was still in grade school he used to go to the high school track meets and match the winning jumps  --  wearing his street clothes . We older brothers did n't mess with him too much after a while , because he was a pretty rough character . " // " He just hates to lose at anything , " says Michigan quarterback Bobby Hebert , who hails from Cut Off , La. and is one of Greenwood 's best friends on the team . " He may get mad if I say this , but what he reminds me of sometimes is a north Louisiana redneck. " // Greenwood 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheap-shot artist , charges still occasionally leveled at him by opponents . The present Wisconsin track coach , Ed Nuttycombe , who had been an assistant to McClimon , saw Greenwood 's recklessness as part of a larger discipline . The coach tells about the time Greenwood was in a decathlon and had one chance left to clear 13 ' 6 " in the vault . Greenwood charged down the runway with fire in his eyes , sailed over the bar , missed the cushion and landed flat on his back on the cement at the side of the pit . People thought he was dead . After a minute he stood up , spit out some blood and continued with the competition , ultimately clearing 14 ' 6 " . // What makes the incident truly remarkable is that Greenwood knew as he planted the pole that he was going to miss the pit , and still went through with the jump . // " I did n't get my hands over my head , so I knew I was going off to the side , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I could keep from landing on my head . I was fired up . I had to make it . " // " I 'm not sure he felt pain at all , " says Nuttycombe . " And it would be hard to measure his courage . " // It also would be hard to name a sport Greenwood could n't excel in . He runs the 40 in 4.55 ; he golfs in the 70s ; he punts for the Panthers , last year averaging 41.4 yards per attempt . Much of his ability traces to his legs . " They 're just explosive , " says Nuttycombe. // Indeed , when Greenwood won the Big Ten high jump crown by clearing seven feet on a windy , rainy day , he weighed 215 pounds . Moreover , he had just finished spring football and had n't practiced jumping in weeks . When he cleared 7 ' 2 " indoors , he weighed between 210 and 215 . Nuttycombe points out that he 's one of the heaviest men ever to clear that height . Jrgen Hingsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also cleared 7 ' 2 " , is the only heavier one that comes to mind . // Greenwood was a natural for the decathlon , but he only competed in it twice , once as a sophomore and once as a junior . He was hindered each time by a lack of practice in certain events , notably the 1,500 , the 400 , the shotput , discus and javelin . Still , in his first try , at a meet in Gainesville , Fla. , he scored a commendable 6,466 points . // In his second attempt , at LSU in the spring of 1981 , he was sailing along until he got to the javelin . " I reared back and threw it as hard as I could and nearly tore my arm off , " says Greenwood . " And it did n't go anywhere . Technique is everything in the javelin , but I 'd never practiced because javelins are n't allowed in the Big Ten . I was disgusted and I promised I would n't enter again until I knew what I was doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his school record . // " He picked things up so fast that just from experience and maybe two more meets he 'd have gotten 7,500 , " says Nuttycombe . " And with work he had the potential to be an 8,000-point decathlete , to be in the top 20 in the world . " // Greenwood thought a lot about the decathlon . He decided that if football did n't pan out , he 'd get back into it , try to pick up a sponsor somewhere and aim for the ' 84 Olympics . " But I do n't know if I 'd have enjoyed it , " he says . " Talent wo n't do it for you . And all I can think about is that 1,500. " // Football is Greenwood 's natural sport , and in a recent Panthers-San Antonio Gunslingers game at the Silverdome it was easy to see why . On a sweep he takes on the Gunslingers ' 260-pound right tackle and knocks him flat . There 's no real need for it  --  somebody else makes the tackle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a statement . Shortly after that he breaks in from the left end of the line , dives and deflects a field-goal attempt . Nobody blocked him , but the football axiom says that even unobstructed , an outside rusher should n't be able to get to the ball before it 's kicked . // Then in the fourth quarter Greenwood gets tackled for a big loss after trying to scramble with a high punt snap . In the stands Julie watches him closely as he jogs to the sidelines . She nods her head . // " David 's mad now , " she says . // And he looks it as he prowls the sidelines  --  jaw thrust forward , arms stiff , the old aggressiveness rising up . A few plays later he blitzes , gets knocked down , scrambles up and chases quarterback Rick Neuheisel 15 yards behind the line before smashing into him and forcing a fumble . The Panthers recover at their own nine and win 26-10. // NFL scouts are keeping a close watch on Greenwood . " The only question we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " says Gil Brandt , vice-president of personnel development for the Dallas Cowboys , voicing the concern of most NFL teams . " That 's a big thing for us now . It means acceleration , breaking after the cut . They do n't have the Kellen Winslows and Todd Christensens in that league , the big , fast tight ends that a strong safety has to cover over here . So it 's hard to tell . // " But David 's such a strong , tough , competitive kid . I do n't know if he 'd be a Pro Bowler in the NFL , but I think you could win a championship with him . " // The Panthers already have and , with a 6-2 record , have a shot at another title . For most teams in most leagues , that 's enough .
