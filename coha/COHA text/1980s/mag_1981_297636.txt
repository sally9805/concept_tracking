A conference on their problems turns into a political rumble <P> The first two White House Conferences on Aging were gatherings of generally like-minded advocates , assembled at federal expense to lobby the Federal Government for more money for the elderly . In 1961 the conference helped build momentum for the passage of Medicare and Medicaid . The 1971 session spurred Congress to a sharp increase in Social Security benefits . But this year , with the White House committed to reducing spending on social services , the delegates were far from like-minded . At times they were as fiery and unruly as college protesters in the ' 60s . <P> The conference started with shrill accusations that the Administration had " rigged " committee assignments to affirm President Reagan 's views . Worried about the growing backlash against the White House , President Reagan made an unscheduled appearance to dispel doubts that he was " somehow an enemy of my own generation . " The conclave ended Thursday with shouts of protest as 2,266 delegates were compelled to approve or reject a package of 600 often contradictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the biggest issue , Social Security , there was a succession of committee votes alternately favoring and opposing the use of general tax revenues to fund the system ; both those conflicting positions were endorsed in the final mass vote on the 14 committee reports . <P> Amid the chaos both sides claimed victory . President Reagan declared he was " pleased . " Yet such advocates of the elderly as Cyril Brickfield , 62 , executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons , and Maggie Kuhn , 76 , founder of the Gray Panthers , called the 60-page conference report " a liberal document . " In fact , the conference did endorse , albeit loosely , nearly all of the " eight for the ' 80s " goals proposed by a consortium of 25 elderly groups . Among the aims : more access to full-time and part-time work ; home delivery of services rather than use of nursing facilities ; an eventual but undefined " national health care plan . " On two pivotal issues , however , the conference adopted positions urged by Reagan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients of Social Security , and it did not endorse immediate passage of national health insurance . <P> Perhaps the most significant debate took place apart from the conference , among statisticians and researchers . The Reagan Administration has reopened a question that elderly advocates had considered long settled : Just how needy are older Americans ? In contrast to what the White House claims is a stereotypic view that the elderly are destitute , enfeebled , neglected and unfed , the Reaganauts have been promoting the image of the " wellderly . " Most older Americans , the Reagan team says , live in houses they own , on adequate incomes , in good health and with sufficient companionship . That image appeals to the pride of the elderly and their desire for self-reliance ; it also undercuts support for major new benefits .
