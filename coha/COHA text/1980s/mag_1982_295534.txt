For presidential aspirants , fund-raising events are usually a safe way to win friends and get press coverage . But when Walter Mondale appeared at a dinner in Manhattan last week , there were political risks . Reason : the occasion was sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign Fund , a political action committee dedicated to advancing the cause of gay rights . <P> Appearing at such a function would have been unthinkable for a national candidate not long ago , and even today gay rights is a subject so highly charged that most politicians would prefer to stay in the closet on the issue . " Sure we weighed the pros and cons , " a Mondale aide says . " But you ca n't sneak around on any issue any more . " <P> Mondale got his biggest applause when he quoted official Democratic Party positions opposing discrimination based on " sex or sexual orientation . " Said he : " Questions of personal conduct that do not threaten the peace and order of society can not rightfully be decided by society . " He scrupulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office has received only a few disapproving telephone calls over his appearance . However , it could come back to haunt him when his presidential campaign begins in earnest . But some political analysts think Mondale made a smart move . Says a staffer at the Democratic National Committee : " Mondale has been in the doldrums . But after a gutsy move like this , people in political circles may start talking about him . " <P> Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts addressed a similar gathering in California in April , and Senator Alan Cranston of California , who also has presidential ambitions , is scheduled to appear before such a group in Philadelphia . As more politicians make these appearances , it seems likely that the risks of seeking such support will be reduced .
