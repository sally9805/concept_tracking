THE LONG GRAY LINE <P> by Rick Atkinson <P> Houghton Mifflin ; 592 pages ; $24.95 <P> A veteran examines a 20-year-old photograph of his graduating class . " The guy on my left is dead now , " he notes . " So is the guy on my right . The three of us did n't fare too well in Viet Nam . I came out the best . " He points with the hook that serves as his right hand . <P> Rick Atkinson 's epic of West Point 's class of ' 66 is marked by such piercing incidents . A Washington Post reporter , he begins by following some 600 freshmen , ruddy and damp in their new gray wool uniforms . Loud harassment is the order of the day ( " Pull that neck in , mister . You call that bracing ? " ) . It has been this way since Thomas Jefferson founded the academy in 1802 , and in the crowd of intimidated cadets the figures tend to blur  --  until destiny selects them for service in Viet Nam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haneke is energized by President John F. Kennedy 's 1961 Inaugural speech calling for a new generation to bear any burden , meet any hardship . He returns from Southeast Asia minus a right leg , a left foot and an eye . Tommy Hayes , the son and grandson of West Point major generals , rejects the sanctuary of graduate school . In a letter home he writes , " My country has invested a great deal in me as a soldier . I should like to repay that investment . " The price is his life , taken in the jungle north of Saigon . <P> Three survivors carry the burden of Atkinson 's narrative . Tom Carhart is a gung-ho lieutenant whose career is derailed by accidents and disfigured by a war he can neither take nor leave . Jack Wheeler is an idealistic Army brat who loses his military faith in the trenches . Postwar , both men have turbulent domestic lives ; both resign their commissions , as do nearly 25% of their class . Both are obsessed by the idea of a Viet Nam memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carhart , a lifelong iconoclast , censures the " black gash of shame and sorrow , hacked into the national visage that is the Mall . " George Crocker , the classic warrior-aristocrat , is far removed from that fray . He distinguishes himself in combat , rises to lieutenant colonel and becomes the liberator of Grenada , a John Wayne figure " doing men things in a manly manner with other men . " <P> It would have been a simple matter to melodramatize or caricature these soldiers ' stories . But Atkinson maintains a tone of scrupulous neutrality , and he never loses the Point of his narrative . All along , his greatest character is the military academy itself , sustained by patriotic zeal in the ' 50s , pocked by controversy in the ' 60s and cheating scandals in the ' 70s , yielding in the ' 80s to a new national temper . Today women are admitted , there is a , course in ethics , and the incoming class is treated with unaccustomed humanity . " Demanding but not demeaning " is the cadre 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before : " Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong , and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won . "
