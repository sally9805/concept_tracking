In Galway one summer , in Oughterard , I walked through a graveyard because of James Joyce . Some things were missing , I knew . The snow was not falling , as it does so vastly at the end of " The Dead " ; and there would be no stone for Michael Furey , the 17-year-old youth who died for love before the story begins . But it was the snow and the death that made The Dead ( Vestron ) the graveyard important . Once again a place in the world was marked and haunted by art that had been made from it . It 's been said that if Joyce had written nothing but " The Dead , " he would be immortal . I doubt it . Surely no better story has been written in English , but it is both difficult and deceptively simple . Without the other stories in Dubliners as prelude ? " The Dead " was written last , and indeed after Dubliners was accepted for publication ? without the subsequent novels and play as context , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now read " The Dead " as by the author of the three novels and the still-underprized play Exiles ( which is relevant to the story ) . A different sort of attention is paid . This is not at all to say that we feel enjoined to find depths in the work because it 's by the great JJ . It is to say that , for decades , it has been read by people whom Joyce has educated to be his readers . One of the best such , Frank O'Connor , himself a master storyteller , saw significance in the fact that not only is it the last story in the book , it 's the last story that Joyce ever wrote . Said O'Connor : " The Dead " ... is entirely different from the others . It is also immensely more complicated . ? . It is easy enough to see from " The Dead " why Joyce gave up storytelling . One of his main passions ? the elaboration of style and form ? had taken control , and the short story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is why it seems like a novel in a small space ? a novella , if you like . Perhaps that is why , despite acres of critical comment , few good readers would assert that they comprehend it completely . O'Connor : " It is not always easy to see what any particular episode represents , though it is only too easy to see that it represents something . " Complex and deceptively open . Those qualities help to explain why , though it tantalizes ambitious filmmakers , it is one more of those works that film can not wholly grasp . The late John Huston , at the end of a career that had highlights but often detoured through the meretricious , brought to " The Dead " all the respect that he could muster . The adaptation by his son , Tony Huston ( the screen credit unashamedly says " Written by Tony Huston " ) , inflicts small harm . Some tiny changes are made in the dialogue : " stewed , " meaning " drunk , " is understandably substituted for " screwed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the film , which runs only 83 minutes ? a guest who contributes to the entertainment by reciting a poem called " Broken Vows " translated from the Irish by Lady Gregory . An anecdote about a horse and a statue is transposed from one place to another . The last long passage of Gabriel 's thoughts is put in the first person and , with some adjustments , is given to him as voice-over narration . But the changes neither hinder nor help . The subtleties and the narrative inextricably linked to them are not reachable by film . In Dublin of 1904 , Gabriel and Gretta Conroy , a married pair in their 30s , go to an annual Christmastime party and dinner given by Gabriel 's two elderly aunts . After some dancing and some entertainment by the guests and one aunt , dinner is served . In a prepared speech , Gabriel proposes a toast to his aunts . After dinner , the guests begin to depart . Just before the Conroys leave , one guest sings a song called " The Lass of Aughrim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They go back to the hotel where they are spending the night , instead of traveling to their distant home through the snow , and in their room Gretta , in tears , tells him that " The Lass of Aughrim " used to be sung by a youth named Michael Furey , out in Galway where she was born , and that he died at 17 . " I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey , Gretta , " says Gabriel . " I was great with him at that time , " she says . Then she tells him that when Michael learned that she was going off to school in Dublin , he rose from his sickbed and stood in the rain under her window , hoping to see her . She implored him to go home , and a week after she reached Dublin , he died . Gretta says , " I think he died for me . " Gretta soon sleeps . Gabriel stands at the window , watching the snow fall , thinking that it is falling all over Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oughterard , thinking of death . This synopsis , though factual , is atrocious . " The Dead " can not be represented , in miniature or at length , outside Joyce 's prose . Therefore Huston 's film , though it has good qualities , is finally not much more than a longer synopsis . Sometimes a film finds cinematic equivalents of the original 's prose ? Pinter 's Proust Screenplay is the leading example of great fiction successfully transformed . But Joyce is diabolical . What is open in his story is inaccessible to film . Chiefly there are Gabriel 's reactions in secret electric shocks , sometimes to trifles ( an absolutely veristic device that Peter Handke also uses ) . A remark about men made by the maid when the Conroys arrive at the party " cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie . " How can one film that ? Huston does n't even try . In the hotel bedroom , the succession of hidden strong reactions to the whole evening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what John Gross calls " the gradual erosion of his egotistical defenses . " Joyce calibrates all these changes exquisitely . The film is confined to surfaces , not because the actor of Gabriel is bad ( he is n't ) but because Gabriel 's changes , open to the reader , are closed to a viewer . The complexities are even further removed from film . Principally there is the prose itself . This is by the magician who later chronicled the history of English prose in parodies that start with Anglo-Saxon and end with American slang while Mina Purefoy 's baby is being born in Ulysses . See what he does with prose in " The Dead " The first sentence : " Lily , the caretaker 's daughter , was literally run off her feet . " The last sentence : " His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling , like the descent of their last end , upon all the living and the dead . " How does one film the effect of the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose 's progress from the " literally " of the opening to the exalted loneliness of the end , from the small details of daily living to a cosmic view of mortality ? Huston had a penchant for tackling the impossible ? Moby Dick and Under the Volcano ( not to mention The Bible ) . Whether this was artistic heroism or myopic egotism it is not important to settle . In any case Huston dealt with " The Dead " as deftly and economically as he could . Two actors stand out . Donal Donnelly battles comically-sadly with the boozy banalities of the alcoholic guest , Freddy Matins . Anjelica Huston is splendid as Gretta ( the one important character whom Joyce does not describe ) . In Pri2- zi 's Honor , also directed by her father , she was striking as a somewhat wacky Italian-American . In Coppola 's Gardens of Stone , she was smart as a Washington journalist . Here with a delicate Irish accent ( an occasional word is muffled ) and with the assurance of pure understanding , she gives us a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her best chance for passion and beauty is buried under the snow . The cinematographer , Fred Murphy , The American musical has become the El Dorado of the Broadway theater ? that lost paradise of total gratification where artists and backers once disported on golden meadows to the sound of ringing cash registers . A character in 42nd Street elegizes musical comedy as " the most beautiful words in the English language , " but there 's a mournful , obsolescent ring to those words now , as if they were already being cycled into archaic language . Once hyperbolized as " our greatest native art form , " the American musical has fallen into disrepair , and the success of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's glitz machines only heightens the miserable condition of our own maladroit contraptions . Just as the Japanese and Koreans have surpassed the United States in the mass-produced technology first created by Henry Ford , so the British have usurped the only theatrical form ever invented ( or respected ) on Broadway . The glories are all in the past , which may account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lists . It may also account for the pervasive aura of nostalgia that surrounds the recent offerings , whether revivals or new works . How many American musicals today take place in the present or deal with issues even remotely meaningful ? It is no accident , as the Marxists used to say , that the remake of Cole Porter 's Anything Goes opened at the Vivian Beaumont in the same week as the stock market crash . First produced during the Depression , it helped then to avert American eyes from the bread lines , the apple stands , and the pin-striped bodies hurtling out of corporate windows . The new revamped pro-who gives lamplit intimacy to the party scenes and crisp cold to the ride home , has lighted Huston so that her somewhat horsey face ? which I liked as was ? resembles Degas . She looks beautiful in a genteelly reconciled way , and she acts , in the last scene particularly , with a grip on the part that grips us , that inspires hopes about her future . Setting Anjelica Huston on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime legacies that John Huston left us. duction of the Lincoln Center Theater is beautifully engineered to provide us with the same insouciant distractions . Equipped with a new book by Timothy Crouse and John Weidman , based on an original script by Guy Bolton , P G. Wodehouse , Howard Lindsay , and Russel Crouse ? and dominated by Cole Porter 's enthralling music and lyrics ? Anything Goes still possesses that enchanting quality of total irrelevance that made it so appealing in the ' 30s . If anything , it is even more irrelevantly appealing today , set in the luxury-class quarters of an ocean liner when , in our own age , cruise ships exist mainly to carry tourist groups to the Caribbean for duty-free shopping , and populated with types who vanished from popular culture soon after Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers stopped dancing the carioca . Anything Goes functions as a voyage through the high seas of the past in the interior of a time boat , the theatrical equivalent of two hours spent watching reruns in a repertory movie house . Under Jerry Zak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Walton 's sets and costumes alone deserve a place in a retrospective exhibit of Musical Comedy Memorabilia . Ornamented with the round silvered curves of Art Deco , the S.S. American cruises the silver seas sporting a white piano bar , a redwhite-and-blue smokestack , and a ship 's orchestra performing on the top deck . As for the characters , they are off the streamlined Art Deco rack as well ? a Yale alum drinking his way across the ocean , a goofy gangster posing as a minister , a square British lord , dowagers anddebutantes , camera-toting reporters in checkered coats , long-legged chorines in flared sailor pants and high heels , the hard-boiled siren Reno Sweeney making out with all available males , the feckless hero Billy Crocker wooing his rich lady love in disguise and ending up with both the girl and a zillion dollars . Fox-trots up and down the gangways , choral tap dances that rattle the decks , gypsy turns and tangos , production numbers by the entire crew and officer staff ? Anything Goes recapitulates everything you ever remembered from the halcyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing are Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton . What is also missing is a book . The Crouse-Weidman revamping improves on the jerry-built original , but the jokes are feebly dependent on the incompatibility of British elegance and American slang ( " Bring me my tea and step in it " ) , and the plot remains a crude comedy of disguise and misunderstanding . Still , the books for these musical comedies were never more than scaffolding for songs , and Porter 's songs retain all their melodic surprise and lyrical wit . It 's odd to be reminded that such classics as " I Get a Kick Out of You , " " You 're the Top , " " It 's Delovely , " " Easy to Love , " " Blow , Gabriel , Blow , " or even the eponymous " Anything Goes , " much less the 11 other superb numbers , were once show tunes ? not just because they have all achieved an enduring independent life , but because today our musical comedy hits are fortunate to feature one memorable song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nowhere in Anything Goes ? the occasion for music is determined by time , pace , and mood , rather than plot requirements ? but they represent the essence of the show . The orchestra , under the bright direction of Edward Strauss , plays these tunes smartly , and they are well sung by virtually everyone in the cast . Patti LuPone , especially , brings a sharp energy to the role of Reno Sweeney , her red velvet slack suit and auburn hair handsomely framing her generous , slightly cruel mouth . And Howard McGillin is an attractive Billy Crocker , though he dances like a four-letter man at the senior prom and his baritone range does n't easily accommodate the countertenor tones he 's often forced to produce . All in all , Anything Goes is a pleasant pastime for those who have the time to pass . If I sound a bit resistant to its charms , well , I 'm getting a little older and my time is somewhat limited .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
