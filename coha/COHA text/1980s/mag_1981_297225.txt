Does it promote cancer ? <P> <P> To cope with anxiety and tension , millions of people reach for a Valium , a tranquilizer that has become the U.S. 's most widely prescribed drug . Now comes a report guaranteed to make users of the drug anything but tranquil . According to a Canadian physiologist , Valium may promote the growth and spread of cancer . <P> Dr. David Horrobin 's disturbing suggestion , presented last week in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , is primarily based on his and others ' studies with tissue cultures and laboratory rats . In one experiment , Horrobin injected breast tumors into 20 cancer-free rats ; half were given a salt solution , and the rest received doses of Valium roughly comparable to high dosages given humans . After four weeks , the mammary tumors in the Valium-treated rats were three times the size of those in the control group . <P> Horrobin also points to a British study of women with breast cancer , some of whom had been using Valium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cancers were more advanced , and after treatment they tended to recur more quickly than in the unmedicated women . The investigator attributed the more rapid growth to anxiety , but Horrobin believes that the tranquilizer 's physical effects might be to blame . This is particularly ominous , says Horrobin , because " after a diagnosis of cancer , tranquilizer use increases two or threefold . " The researcher adds : " Since nobody has bothered to look at tranquilizer use in patients receiving cancer therapy , all the studies comparing treatments may be messed up . " <P> Horrobin claims that his work and press interviews on the tranquilizer led to his being forced out of a research position at the University of Montreal in 1979 . Hoffmann-La Roche , the maker of Valium , was quick to dispute his findings last week . Among rats that spontaneously developed cancer , says the company , there was no speed-up in tumor growth when they were given Valium . Moreover , notes Hoffmann-La Roche , human epidemiological studies have revealed no link between cancer and Valium use . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have measured only the incidence of cancer , not the rate at which tumors grow . The final verdict on Valium is still not in.
