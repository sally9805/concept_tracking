txt Bouncing about the provinces in those long distant days of the 1980 primary campaign , George Bush used to commend himself to the voters as a man who could see the world ' ' not as it should be , but as it really is . " Earlier this year Vice President Bush praised Ferdinand Marcus of Philippines for his " adherence to democratic principle , " a remark symbolic of the administration 's inability to distinguish between illusion and reality , two spheres now Viewpoint by Alexander Cockburn so far apart that one is tempted to pack a toothbrush and rush to the deep shelters . In its relationship with the world beyond the borders of the United Slates the Reagan administration seems to be entnely propelled by obsession  --  never a helpful ingredient of foreign policy . The paramount obsession remains , of course , the Soviet Union . Twice already the obsession has been expressed in an advanced pathological form by officials of the National Security Council . Last winter Professor Richard Pipes said that war with the Soviet Union was " inevitable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major General Robert Schweitzer , lop military official at the NSC , spoke publicly of a " drift toward war . " A White House official hastened to call Gen. Schweitzer 's remarks " off the wall " and the general was summarily dismissed from the NSC . But are the Russians  --  accepting that " off the wall " can be adequately rendered into their language  --  always to assume that the NSC is populated by harmless cranks , normally kept under wraps ? Are the Europeans ? Or are they to assume that such officials can thrive only in a nourishing atmosphere , propitious to nonchalant invocation of nuclear conflict ? Oil the heels of Gen. Schweitzer 's dismissal Defense Secretary Weinberger was attempting to haul Ronald Reagan 's foot out of his mouth after the President 's casual concession that " an exchange " of tactical nuclear weapons could occur in Europe without provoking a wider holocaust . It was not that the President was being particularly heterodox . A deluded faction of nuclear strategists have long held that such limited engagements can take place . What alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviled in this matter ? is the obsessive tenor of the rhetoric , in the midst of which dutiful talk about arms negotiations sounds exactly what it is : a figleaf for deployment of the Pershing Its and Cruise missiles . The obsession recurs in Central America , with all the administration talk , echoed in an editorial in this newspaper last Monday , about the paramount threat of Soviet-Cuban subversion . It does not require attendance at Cancun to know that the prime threats to stability in Central America are not Cuban advisers , but wildly fluctuating commodity prices , the high cost of oil , high interest rates , inflation , unemployment and crippling long-term debt . Yet , to a bankrupt Costa Rica , Jeane Kirkpatrick offered military aid . Nowhere are delusions more apparent at this hour than in the matter of the Awacs , about whose possible sale to Saudi Arabia debate in Congress is approaching climax . In the minds of the Air Force , the Defense Department and the administration the Awacs is evidently regarded as the most practical modern substitute for the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dispatched to areas of crisis as a symbol of U.S. might and unremitting vigilance . Exactly how these parcels of electronic equipment , spraying the environment with microwaves , are meant to augment the security of the House of Saud remains unclear . Would Anwar Sadat 's security on that reviewing stand have been enhanced if the Awacs , rushed belatedly to Egypt . had been overhead at the time ? My column in this space Sept. 24 suggested that the Awacs ' much-touted radar can be jammed , and that in many other respects its technical prowess has been greatly over-rated . This provoked some amusing testimony ( tom the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Gen. David Jones , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Oct. 8 . Sen. Nancy Kassebaum IR. , Kans.i asked whether it was true " that the lAwacs'i radar can be easily jammed , as has been reported . " Sen. Kassebaum referring to a jamming test of the Awacs In which two ** had managed to get within 150 feet of the Awacs undetected . " It just happened , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there ... that saw a number of miles away a glint in the sky , as the Awacs turned on reflection , and ' the ** went over there and said how easy it is to intercept . ... But the Awacs was required to be in that position . It could not leave its orbit . ... " How come these F-Ifs , lazing about in the skies , suddenly enter the story ? Au explanation could be that In my col umn on Awacs , " F-106 " was misprinted in the paper as " F-I6 . " The misprinted F-16s seem to have stirred the general 's imagination to great efforts to find an innocent role for them . Now the tests in question were requested in 1975 by Sen. Tom Eagleton ID. , Mo.i and conducted m May of that year . A number of planes , Including ** and an EA-6B jamming plane were involved in a trial of the Awacs under jamming conditions . The Awacs and its defending F-Its failed the test . In June 1973 , the General Accounting Office sent its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May 1973. " serial number PSAD75.109 , to Sen. Eagleton . It seems that no ** participated in the radar jamming test , which would have been difficult in any case since the decision to produce the F-16 was taken only in Jan nary 1973 . The ** were a cin dully planned part of the test and far from an accidental presence . Coincidental with the adverse GAO report , Gen. Jones , at that time chief of staff of the Air Force , set off on his travels to promote the Awacs Iran and Saudi Arabia , a sales mission which has now flowered into a billion dollar obsession and red herring , distracting attention from the maim problems of the region .
