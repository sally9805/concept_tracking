H.G. WELLS : ASPECTS OF A LIFE by Anthony West Random House ; 405 pages ; $22.95 <P> They met in the fall of 1912 . He was 46 , married , a prolific author of verve and renown . She was 19 , single and unknown . When their affair ended ten years later , three people had been wounded beyond measure or retribution . But it was not for want of trying . In his day , H.G. Wells railed against his ungrateful mistress Rebecca West . She in turn portrayed herself as the suffering Other Woman , 15 forced to bring up their illegitimate son , Anthony West , on a restricted income . Now , at the age of 69 , Anthony has weighed in . <P> It is not the first time . In 1955 , West described his unhappy early life in Heritage , an autobiography masked as a novel . Rebecca West ( 1892-1983 ) blocked its publication in England , and in a new introduction to a paperback reissue of Heritage , the author bitterly recalls " my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias , one could hardly expect a dispassionate recollection of times past . But H.G. Wells : Aspects of a Life is more than the defense of a neglected author . It is a kind of intellectual 's Mommie Dearest , a serious chronicle that uses Rebecca West as a counterweight to raise the reputation of her lover . <P> In the biographer 's view , Herbert George Wells ( 1866-1946 ) was a genius with a powerful physical presence . His foresight , combined with a generous , romantic spirit , made him irresistible to women and children and , indeed , to much of the reading public .

" <P> That strategy is only partly successful , since West prefers the exaggerated phrase . His father is " a very big man indeed . " As for Wells ' opponents , Henry James is charged with literary dictatorship and George Bernard Shaw with " Stalinism . " And yet the author 's praise is not entirely fulsome . Prophetic fiction owes its very existence to Wells . He was , as Joseph Conrad wrote , a " realist of the fantastic . " In The World Set Free , he predicted the atom bomb ; in The Island of Dr. Moreau , organ transplants ; in The War of the Worlds , laser beams . Wells also produced a vast body of nonfiction , capped by The Outline of History , an almost hysterically optimistic attempt to trace mankind 's ascent from darkness to a science-aided summit far from the present day . Like most of Wells ' work , it was a monumental bestseller in its own time , and is almost unread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
