FORGET FATHERS The Anatomy Lesson by Philip Roth In Philip Roth 's early story " The Conversion of the Jews , " a small boy , by threatening to throw himself from a high roof , gets his mother , his rabbi , the caretaker of his synagogue , and a crowd of waiting firemen and schoolmates all to kneel down and confess a belief in the Immaculate Conception of Mary the mother of Jesus . It is an act of power and revenge and desecration on the boy 's part , a wild mischief , but it is also a bid for freedom , and a secular sermon on the tiles . The boy has been hit by the rabbi and by his mother for asking intelligent but irreverent questions about religion , has fled in panic to the top of the building and discovered the magical properties of his possible leap ; he says now " You should n't hit me about God , Mama . . . . Promise me , promise me you 'll never hit anybody about God . " The whole kneeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firemen 's yellow net , which glows in the dusk " like an overgrown halo . " The perfect poise of this story depends on the innocence of the boy 's curiosity ? he only wants to know why the deity who created light ca n't cause a virgin to conceive if he wishes ? and on a complicated cultural irony . History is full of people being hit about God , but the hitters have not usually been Jews . The boy leads his people out of their narrow , nervously defended cage into the cage of an even more cruel and haughty keeper . Other characters in Roth 's fiction are not so innocent , but they keep stumbling into the same irony : you ca n't escape your past without getting entangled in someone else 's present and past . The recurring comic form of this situation in Roth is marriage to a gentile . Nathan Zuckerman , in My Life as a Man , defends his sister 's right to marry a man who is " worthless by most anyone 's standards " and " repulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his point , he says , and he , with his " high-minded permissiveness , " missed theirs ; and his sister successively found two husbands " who confirmed , in nearly every detail , my family 's prejudice against them . " Another form of the situation is Roth 's fiction itself : a series of insults to the world of the fathers . At least , this is how his writer-heroes find their work is viewed , and they simultaneously court and are outraged by the charge . " Forget fathers , " Zuckerman tells himself in Zuckerman Unbound . " Plural . " In The Anatomy Lesson , which completes the trilogy begun with The Ghost Writer , Zuckerman is still tender on this score , furious at being thought anti-Semitic merely because he metaphorically converts the Jews , holds them up to the harsh stare of gentile eyes . I keep thinking of a scene in Woody Allen 's Annie Hall , where a Jewish character pictures himself as he thinks a WASP grandmother must see him : earlocks , flat hat , gabardine , the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype , but breezier , more secular , closer to the Jewish joke , although he does this not to represent anxiety as Allen does , but to subvert and generalize the tyranny of the figure . Most of us live locked in the world of our fathers , whether we oppose or obey them , as the Karamazov brothers and Clarissa Harlowe knew all too well . Many writers , and not only Jewish ones , use their backgrounds as material , reach for what Roth calls their " slice of the American piety , " or any other piety . Zuckerman , free of his earnest , demanding father , mourns for the lavish troubles he has lost : No new Newark was going to spring up again for Zuckerman , not like the first one : no fathers like those pioneering Jewish fathers bursting with taboos , no sons like their sons boiling with temptations , no loyalties , no ambitions , no rebellions , no capitulations , no clashes quite so convulsive again . Never again to feel such tender emotion and such a desire to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jews , " Roth has the irony under gentle but firm command : Zuckerman 's thought is both accurate and sentimental , its truth clothed in a characteristically excited yearning for the mess he has gotten out of . He does n't really want it back , he just does n't know what to do without it . Roth is not Zuckerman , of course , but he does n't simply separate himself from his alter egoist . He brilliantly blurs and complicates the tracks which lead from him to his fiction , so that now the tracks seem unmistakable , and now they vanish or go nowhere . This means Roth can pounce upon those who exaggerate the resemblance between author and character , and smile at the thought of critics scrupulously missing it , worried as we are about personae and points of view and other obliquities of narration . " Where Emma Bovary had read too many romances of her period , " Zuckerman writes in My Life as a Man , " it would seem that I had read too much of the criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zuckerman and Roth have read just the right amount . They are waiting for us at every turn . " It seemed then that I was making one of those moral decisions that I had heard so much spinning Zuckerman monologues . As we have known since Portnoy , Roth is the textual equal of the best fast-talking comedians , and his verve is unfailing . In Zuckerman Unbound our hero tries to live with his fame as the author of the lurid and best-selling Carnovsky , and with the death and dying curse of his father , and with the strangled resentment of his brother . He is hounded by a disgraced quiz contestant from the 1950s ? a man who really knew the answers and did n't want to be fed them ? by threatening phone calls and by his own wobbling conscience . Did his betrayals really bring his father to the grave ? The comedy modulates not into an answer to Zuckerman 's questions but into an evocation of his bereavement . He winds up in his lost Newark , doubly depopulated by the removal of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a ghost himself now . " Who you supposed to be ? " a black man asks , eyeing Zuckerman in his vast , rented limousine complete with bodyguard . " No one , " Zuckerman says , and thinks , " and that was the end of that . " But Zuckerman is not no one , and in The Anatomy Lesson he is alive and distinctly unwell . He has four mistresses in place of one dead mother , a compensation beyond Proust 's wildest dreams , but he is smitten by a mysterious , unremitting pain for which all his friends and doctors have different , plausible diagnoses . It is a symptom of guilt over his great success , a manifestation of his fear of everything , an expression of his deeply buried anger . Zuckerman , sensibly , is having none of this : the pain is just stupid , meaningless pain . He sees orthopedists , neurologists , a physiotherapist , a rheumatologist , a radiologist , an osteopath , a vitamin doctor , an acupuncturist , and an analyst , and despairs not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest disease . " He is " bewildered by defeat on a front where he had n't even known himself to be at war . " He beg.ns to lose his hair ( along with " his confidence , his sanity , and his self-respect " ) , and quarrels with a distinguished Jew-ish critic who has berated him for pandering to gen-tiles and self-hating Jews and now wants him to write something uplifting about Israel . The time is 1973 : the world of the fa-thers strikes again . Zuck-erman decides to escape what Henry James ( en-dorsed in The Ghost Writer by the young Zuckerman ) called the madness of art , the business of " compli-cating life for himself on paper , " and to go to medi-cal school in Chicago . On the flight out to look into the possibilities , popping pills against the pain , he becomes more than faintly manic , and goes into a vivid impersonation of a porno king which lasts for days . All Roth 's escalating wit is on display here , and he hits some good targets too : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though serious-ness ca n't be as stupid as anything else " ) , the hy-pocrisies of many emanci-pated attitudes toward sex ( " People used to say to me when I first went into sleaze , How long are they going to let you do this ? That 's crazy . What are they letting me do ? .. . They think I give freedom a bad name . Freedom 's supposed to have a bad name . . . . " ) . But among the fireworks lurks Zuckerman 's pain . Roth speaks of the " selfness of pain " : " Had he kept a pain diary , the only entry would have been one word : myself . " The pain confirms his old self-absorption and imprisons him in it . And this , it seems , is Roth 's worry and the underlying subject of his book . He wrote recently , in The New York Times Book Review , about the " consequences of writing fiction in Czechoslovakia , " compared with the cozy consequences , the tiny penalties , and the big perks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish mistress , whose story , he thinks , may lead him away from self , from what he calls his " dwarf drama " : You do n't want to represent her Warsaw ? it 's what her Warsaw represents that you want : suffering that is n't semi-comical , the world of massive historical pain instead of this pain in the neck . Zuckerman 's pain , it seems , is the self , that subject which regularly threatens American writers like a descending glass jar . His interest in medical school is an attempt to reach out to others . ( " Other people , " he muses , " somebody should have told me about them a long time ago . " But would he have listened ? ) At the end of the book he achieves a modest immersion in the life of a Chicago hospital , not as a doctor , but as a walking patient , recovering from a fractured jaw ( he fell on a Jewish tombstone while high on vodka and Percodan , trying to strangle an old man he took for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the problem lie in the self or in history ? Are our writers trivial because they are not jailed or muzzled as in the Eastern bloc , or because they ca n't see beyond their private pain ? Are they trivial at all , or is the triviality Roth 's ? His answer , as I read it from his novels , is a telling and complicated one . We ca n't hanker for oppression in order to make ourselves feel significant . That would be absurd , and an insult to those who are oppressed ? the political equivalent of dreaming up a marriage to Anne Frank . But the self does need enemies : fathers , critics , communities , wives , fans , spongers , or even commissars ? all manifestations of the reality principle , " life itself , " " the real raw thing , " the heavy stuff that holds the fantasticator down . Only enemies tug us toward others . If freedom means betrayal in Roth 's early work , betrayal means reality in the later novels , since it proves there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the self still has a noisy role , and there are other ways of dealing with the world . The self , in this view , only wants the world as confirmation of its existence . Accomplished and enjoyable as the work is , the snag with The Anatomy Lesson is that Roth invites us to see the delusion in Zuckerman 's altruism but then still gives him full marks for being decent enough to entertain it . Zuckerman wants to go to medical school in the way he wanted to marry Anne Frank : as an answer to the critics in his head . But this pathetic maneuver is so transparent that it wo n't carry the weight Roth placed on it . Zuckerman himself should have seen , as he sees so many other things , that his doctor dream was not sturdy enough even for fantasy . " Oh , ironic paranoia is the worst , " he thinks on the subject of his anger . You " see your roaring , righteous hatred as a supremely comical act , " but you go on roaring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning ego in all your attempts to escape from self , but you still applaud the attempts , as if they really took you away from the mirror .
