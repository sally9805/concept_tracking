Worried , the P.R.I . wins big <P> The omens were dark . An earthquake had shaken the ground , birds in the town square were squawking feverishly , and all night long the wind whipped through the streets . In addition , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( P.R.I. ) , which has won every major election in Mexico since its founding in 1929 , had last month absorbed its worst defeat ever , losing nine municipal and five legislative seats in two northern states . On the eve of last week 's elections for the legislature in the impoverished southern state of Oaxaca , where leftists had been successfully organizing , and wooing , local peasants , another P.R.I , loss seemed imminent . Yet when the votes were counted , the P.R.I . had swept all 17 seats . The opposition immediately accused the ruling party of having used ten-year-old voters , a drunken electoral representative and out-and-out ballot box-stuffing to ensure victory , but it has so far offered no proof of foul play . <P> The P.R.I , left little doubt that it intends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of adroit political maneuvering could be seen in the town of Juchitn ( pop . 110,000 ) , whose predominantly Indian population had grown increasingly sympathetic to the militant leftist coalition COCEI , which has energetically implemented popular civic reforms . The P.R.I , did not take any legal action last spring when the COCEl reinstalled a radical peasant , Leopoldo de Gyves , as mayor of Juchitn . But as the elections approached , the ruling party began to assert its power . Government-run Oaxacan newspapers ran spurious accounts of fizzled COCEI rallies . Seven days before the elections , P.R.I , and COCEI sympathizers clashed violently in Juchitn , leaving two people dead and dozens injured . Accusing De Gyves of having fomented the incident , the state governor simply replaced him with a P.R.I , man and postponed Juchitn 's elections . Finally , on election day , the P.R.I , preserved the contours of democracy without its risks by allowing some 10,000 leftists to stage an impassioned though peaceful rally . <P> The P.R.I .

Although the P.R.I , has tolerated defeats in the north , Oaxaca is dangerously close to Guatemala , the site of last week 's coup and gateway to the Central American quagmire.
