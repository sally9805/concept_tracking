A child is torn <P> In legal jargon she is called Baby Girl , Alien No . A21324657 . The day after she was born to a Mexican mother in a Tijuana hospital , she was carried away by an American couple . Adopted , say the couple ; kidnaped , says the mother . In the six years since then , a bitter , tangled legal battle has been fought over the custody of the bright and friendly child , piling up proceedings in seven U.S. courts alone and calling for Solomonic choices between two families , two nationalities , two cultures . <P> The mother is Angela Macias-Rosales , 34 , who , with her common-law husband , runs a small restaurant near Tijuana . She has been dramatized in the Mexican press as " Madre sufrida sin hija " ( long-suffering mother without daughter ) . The Americans are Mark Johns , 42 , and his wife Eileen , 39 , who in 1975 traveled to Tijuana from their home in Fremont , Calif. , to adopt a baby . Whether a transaction occurred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known is that the Johnses crossed back over the border with the child , whom they named Cynthia . A Mexican judge , acting on Macias-Rosales ' complaint , issued a warrant for Mark Johns on a kidnaping charge . <P> In the U.S. , justice moved slowly . <P> Cindy had celebrated her third birthday before immigration authorities finally ruled that there had been no legal adoption and she should be deported . Johns , a medical laboratory consultant who has sometimes posed as a doctor , quickly moved his family to Florida . Soon thereafter , lawyers for Macias-Rosales found them , and a flurry of activity ensued in state and federal courts , resulting in a deadlock . In early 1980 the Immigration and Naturalization Service again ordered deportation and got Cindy , kicking and screaming , as far as Miami International Airport before a federal judge intervened . <P> Five months later , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit invalidated all prior INS proceedings . The reason : while the feuding parents had attorneys , no one represented Cindy , which the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A judge picked Miami Attorney Theodore Klein , 41 , to be Cindy 's guardian , instructing him to determine which outcome would be in the child 's best interest and to press for it with the INS and in the courts . <P> It was a tough assignment . A psychological evaluation of Macias-Rosales indicated that she would be a good parent , but other consultants recommended that the Johnses keep Cindy because a strong bond had formed between them . Some also noted another barrier to life in Mexico : Cindy speaks no Spanish . After a year , Klein concluded that the child should be reared by the Johnses , mainly because of educational opportunities in this country . Klein 's critics accused him of cultural bias and insisted that U.S. courts had no business ruling on the fate of a child who was in this country illegally . Some complained that the Johnses were being rewarded for having flouted the law long enough to strengthen their emotional-bond argument . <P> Now it appears that the legal wrangle may have been an empty exercise .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
