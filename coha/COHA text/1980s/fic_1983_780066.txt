Sector , Earth . Deceased M-G 29 . " KJ013  | Charity Bentham also changed after the rescue . From what I learned of her conduct beforehand , she had known despair but overall had been assertive , effective , self-generating . Her performance on the pier with the Brigadesmen was typical of her power . On board Angel of Death all that disappeared . She gave the impression that if Peregrine left her sight , she herself would disappear . If Peregrine was more loving afterward , Charity was all sentiment , a creature so fragile and vulnerable that one worried the sea might wash her away as she huddled with Peregrine in the gangway . She stopped speaking in complete sentences . She must have talked at length with Peregrine , for I saw them wrapped in conversation . I never overheard her . And as he grew stronger , Peregrine developed a way of speaking for Charity , as if there were two bodies , one voice , one heart . Where was the Nobel Laureate ? The answer is that she was in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary human being . Before , she had pursued fortune and power . After , she pursued Peregrine . She applied that will of hers to reawakening a man who should have died soon after his rescue . It was as if she kissed him back to life , adored him , in order to keep him from quitting us . She performed a miracle of love and hope . And as Charity 's hope filled Peregrine , their love conjoined affected all of us on board . We did not become new men , like Peregrine , but there were changes . Israel joked less , spoke seriously , perhaps heavily , to me . He explained how wrong he had been to spurn Charity 's help , saying , " I should never have given up on those two . " He warned me never to wait for love , as he had done with Molly . Guy was more patient , doting not just on Earle but also on Molly and me and even my dogs , whom he had never much liked . Thord talked less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive when not upset by Orri 's ordeal with Gizur 's hallucinations . Earle remained steady , as taciturn as ever , with the change that he spoke up more readily in our shipboard councils ; he was fatherly toward the Turks and conciliatory toward the Furore brothers , not waiting for Guy 's lead . We had each changed some , then , not entirely for the better , certainly in concert with our expectations . We congratulated ourselves for having survived the fire . We felt tempered . We had lost everything we possessed and yet held to our community . Those  | first few days out of Stockholm harbor , we could admire Charity 's care for Peregrine , and Peregrine 's metamorphosis , and all our reconciliations , and have reason to believe that we were free of Sweden 's murder . Yet we were not so free that one of our number could not easily remind us of our troubles . Cleopatra Furore patrolled our consciences . It was unfair and cruel of her , yet I know now it was in character , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles that we could have been spared her dissent until later . Her brothers seemed to restrain their moods and did cooperate with the business of getting on . Cleopatra alone stood apart , and imperially . She treated Lazarus as her prime minister , the other two as her courtiers . She treated us as vulgarians . Whenever there was gaiety on deck , she would appear in a rush , a cloaked and accusatory look about her , and try to intimidate us into sobriety , which generally worked , even on the gentlest , least culpable of us , Molly . And why ? Guilt alone would have been sufficient . We really had rescued the man who had murdered her father . And we were openly prideful of our action . Yet that was our initial reaction , our affair to digest , and I believe would have eventually settled into a manageable history . Perhaps Cleopatra sensed that the passing of time would make her conduct out of place . And so she did more than silently accuse us . She was belligerent . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulative , venomous . I dwarfed her physically , and she was no slight person . In reply she made me feel an intellectual mite . In conversation , between us or in a group , she would cut me off , dismiss me , overwhelm me . She was as eager to mock me as I was to avoid her . She wanted to humiliate me , and went farther on one of the first nights on Angel of Death : she cursed me . " Any woman who could love that man is no mother to me , " she said . This is typical of her talk , premeditated hyperbole . " And if you could see as I do , Grim Fiddle , you would know how odious to me is everything that man loves . You are worse than he is . " What did that mean ? It was non-sensible , so filled with revulsion as to he pitiable . At the time , though , I thought it impossibly profound and undecipherable . I could not reply . I moved away , afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | feet of Norse timber . And she pursued me , running on about how she held me responsible for Charity 's love for Peregrine , and Peregrine 's escape from death , and all that had happened . It seemed for Cleopatra that I was Peregrine 's first and most contemptible crime , the one that had engendered the divorce , the remarriage , and Cleopatra 's conception . Therefore , for Cleopatra , I was the germ of all that had befallen the Furores . Israel several times attempted to explain to me how he saw Cleopatra 's attitude toward me . He said that Peregrine had wrongly murdered Cesare Furore and been rightly condemned for it . Charity had delivered Peregrine from his ruin , for her own contradictory reasons . All this confused Cleopatra and gradually came to sicken her . Cleopatra was left with a murdered father whom she wanted to revenge , and an aggrieved mother whom she wanted to help . Then Charity had actually involved Cleopatra in a conspiracy to rescue the man she naturally reviled . Cleopatra had cooperated , reluctantly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling shame for what she thought was the betrayal of her father , turned against everyone who reminded her of the sadness . With the best and most praiseworthy of motives , love for her father and mother , Cleopatra felt something she was constrained from acting on  --  revenge  --  and Cleopatra had done something she could not accept in retrospect , helped to deliver Peregrine . She could separate herself from Charity , and could continue to condemn Peregrine , and could regret her fate . But that was not enough , or at least it did not satisfy her . Her frustration unbalanced her . I recall Israel saying she felt stained by her father 's blood . Cleopatra herself became murderous . And she stabbed at what represented to her Peregrine 's dark side  --  the side that had murdered  --  and this was his bastard , Grim Fiddle . I remain cautious of all this . It seems too neat to me now , certainly too Greek . Israel would appreciate my suspicion of his theory . If people were so logical , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleopatra might have hated me from the first , without need for specific cause , with a general disgust for her condition . Yet she also seemed to have need of me . And I argue now that what she needed was my presence , the fact of me , the eagerness and awkwardnesss of me trying to understand her , pity her , help her . I represented to her not only  | her persecuting fate , as Israel said , but also her success at standing up to her tormentors , her father 's murderers . I was her pride of conquest , in that she could feel herself most righteous and indomitable when she could strike at me . I provided her a certain sense of identity in her confusion of roles , for to revile me was to demonstrate that she remained unreconciled to her fate . Seeing me would hurt her , hurting me would hurt her , knowing I was hurt would hurt her . All this pain , cruelty , hardheartedness would make her feel justified . It does seem contradictory that one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can cling to joy and joy-making . That is what Cleopatra seemed to do , passionately . In this peculiar way , from the first , I was Cleopatra 's passion . She lavished on me a nakedness of soul that one would ordinarily give to a lover . This confounded me as it compelled me . I risk to argue here that I became Cleopatra 's passion as Peregrine had become Charity 's . As we were father and son , they were mother and daughter , by blood , by manner , and by persuasion to love and to hate and to remain unresolved . This investigation will have'to end for now , perhaps for always unless I am further tempted by it . The truth of it might be that I did not understand Cleopatra then any better than I do now . I admit my failure to render her . I wish that I had Israel to turn to , or perhaps a book of these things  --  crimes of the heart . That is the depth of it . I was attacked by Cleopatra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her in defense of my self . We fought on the battleground of our hearts for the satisfaction of revenging our parents ' wrongdoings , for the satisfaction of conquering each other 's very reason for being . We were conceived in a confusion of fate : she could have been my sister , I could have been her . How could there ever be a finish to our contest ? We both lost as we both won . How I still can feel my fear of her as I feel my love for her ! I wonder if she feels the same of me . The single conclusion I offer myself , after all this time , is that our love was , from the first abrupt exchange at Vexbeggar , as unlucky as it was hopeless . Grandfather was the first of us to notice the new shame in the world of men . Ile had kept apart from us the first few days  | out of Stockholm harbor , busy commanding a makeshift crew as Angel of Death cleared the Baltic for the Kattegat and Skaggerak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our recapitulations and peacemakings . He looked to his ship and to the sea . He gained a clear vision of certain eerie irregularities in the merchant traffic , the shoreline , the sea . The evening he took me into his confidence was humblingly bright with stars , Castor and Pollux nearly straight above , like eyes of heaven . Wild Drumrul and Lazarus had the watch at the wheel ; Orlando the Black , Babe , and Earle had the deck watch . They were bantering playfully as we came on deck . Grandfather , somber and gruff , invited me forward , making it clear he disapproved of the watch 's conduct . He sat me down by the foremast . We were soon drenched in a cold mist as Angel of Death , trimmed for slow running in a rolling sea , cut a steady course westward . Grandfather gestured above to the Milky Way . He said something odd about signs , in Old Norse . I was impressed and delighted to discover that Grandfather knew the heavens as keenly as he knew the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critic . He began loudly , " You are a prize ! I see that . No man could have raised you better . " " You will like my father . He was n't always like this , " I said . " No matter now . Do you know what they have in mind ? " " Israel and Guy ? " " That heathen lot . They want me to take you halfway around the earth . To this Baja California . They do not know . I shall not tell them . I shall tell you . " " You 're a fine teacher . We 're a better ship every day , " I started . I thought he meant that his ship 's hands were amateurs . Initially I had worried about this , but I could see that Angel of Death , even with Black Crane lashed down between her masts , was a muscular beauty ; she had originally been built for weathering the brutal Gulf of Bothnia . Grandfather once boasted to me that three men and a Bible could sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of the crew , however , when I felt Grandfather 's impatience . I asked , " What is it you know ? " " I am not one to quit a rough business , " he said , gesturing to the west , " but we have no chance for this Mexico . "  | " It 's where the Furores live , " I tried . I was wrong again . He turned on me slowly , his hair and beard matted like stone by the sea spray , his face filled with a dreadful certainty . He wiped his eyes . He studied me . It was not then possible for me to imagine anything Grandfather could not do , or anything that was too rough for him to try . " You think me a monster . Is that what they tell you ? For what I did ? My work with the League ? A monster ? " I struggled to say I did not understand . " Speak your face , " he said . " It was ugly , what you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I did , what I had to do , what we did  --  we were saints compared to what is out there , " Grandfather said , pointing to the west . " I have served Lord God all my life . I would sooner put this knife into your heart than disobey Lord God . Understand this , Grandson . When Lord God told his servant Noah to build him an ark ; and when Lord God told Noah , The loathsomeness of all mankind has become plain to me , for through them the earth is full of violence , and I intend to destroy them , and the earth with them ' ; and when Lord God fulfilled this terrible plan ; and when Lord God spared Noah and the remnant after one month and twenty-seven days ; and when Lord God told Noah and his to come out again on this sanctified earth and be fruitful and increase there , I ask , then , was Lord God a monster ? Is he ugly to you ? Was he wrong ? Speak right to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not , Grandfather , " I said . " Then you begin to understand the power and the wisdom of Lord God , almighty and all terrible and all righteous . We of the League did his work . We tried to build us an ark . We tried to save a remnant from the wrath of Lord God for mankind 's loathsomeness . We tried and it was worth the trying . Their wickedness is alive , stronger every day . We might have succeeded . It is my failure that I was called away , that I was not strong enough to see our work to the end . It is also my failure that , for my wrong to you , I am brought low . I accept my path . I have you . I do not challenge Lord God 's wisdom . I serve it . " " Please , Grandfather , I do n't know the Bible as you do , " I said , deep breathing , for if ever there was a first moment for me  | to learn moral courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , did n't he promise Noah , after the flood , that he would never send the waters again , no matter how evil man might become ? " Grandfather rumbled ; the sound of a mountain moving . And I do believe that he started a smile that was erased by the wind . " I can not believe it was as you say , " I continued . " And I can not believe Lord God would do that to people . At Vexbeggar they burned schools and churches . They shot at children . And those poor people drowned their own babies . I think I had to kill a man because of what your League did . " " You fought for your own . That is not wrong . We fought for our own . That is not wrong . Their wickedness , Grim , it is everywhere . Satan takes the soul of any man who does not love Lord God completely . What I have seen ! What I have done ! What can a boy know of what heathen do to believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice . Not mine . I am prepared to admit my error . Show me where I was wrong to fight for my people . Show me , tell me . I was not wrong ! I struck at darkness , as you did at Vexbeggar . You call me ugly and wrong . The darkness is worse than anything you have seen . You do not know the dark . It is not that sky . It is not that sea . It is not what I have done . It is there and there and there ! " Grandfather flung his arms south , east , west . I stood beside him , looked out in the directions he gave . I said , " I see the world , Grandfather . It frightens me . It does n't hate me . Why should I hate it ? " " You want to see the darkness ? " he said , annoyed , ferocious . " Then use your eyes and wits . If you had , you would have seen that German wolf to starboard today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know of that place of theirs , that heathen land , America ? Does your father tell you ? Does that woman ? Have you heard of their infamy ? " " Do you mean Vietnam ? " " Done and gone ! Worse than what a boy sees . See it ! " I felt I was missing a fantastic battle . I wanted to see something . I strained . There was still only the world . He put his arm around me , not friendly , a death grip . " You ! " thundered Grandfather . " I want to save you from their  | darkness ! Come with me . We can take that karfi of yours and make northwest . I know some good men . Greenland would take us in . We could fish , keep clear for a while longer . " " What has happened ? What have n't you told me ? " " There is no refuge . There is no sanctuary . There is no peace . This Baja , this California  --  lies ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fight only when we can not run more . See it ! " He ordered me to leave , not to bother him again until I had made my decision about Greenland . I had no reply , could not imagine what I should say . Was Grandfather mad , as Israel said repeatedly . Or was he trying to tell me something significant in a language I could not interpret ? I wanted to establish a sure relationship with him despite his thunder . Grandfather was a man with whom one could be intimate , if he permitted , without ever enjoying an intimate moment . His devotion to me was direct , captivating . He did not want to talk about it , or even show it in any normal manner . I asked myself why he seemed to believe in me so absolutely . He did say he owed me for his wrong to me , for abandoning me at birth . Perhaps his fidelity to Grim Fiddle was a way to express his dedication to the idea of his own destiny , perhaps his faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps he believed in me simply because he loved me , as a grandfather should love his grandson . If that was all of it  --  love  --  then I can puzzle out more than our bond . I can speak to what I am . For with that love Grandfather passed on to me huge parts of himself . I understand this now , that all the energy , fortitude , perseverance , daring , vision I possess , as well as the pridefulness , hypocrisy , cruelty , and plain dishonesty , springs from the fury in Grandfather ; it is also mixed with what I learned from Father of the ironies of loss , surrender , helplessness . As I once learned to respect Father 's melancholy , I learned on board Angel of Death to respect Grandfather 's resolve . My situation on board Angel of Death was such that I could no more have denounced and turned from Grandfather than I could have denounced and turned from one of those wearying , mesmerizing , indefatigably brutal prophets of Judah who harassed , cursed , condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t he same sort of " darkness " Grandfather announced to me . Grandfather was mad , in the rational sense Israel meant . That  | must be established : Grandfather lacked reason . Yet there was grandeur and savvy in him . It should not be forgotten now , when the heat and rush of those times can seem as long ago as Noah 's flood , that those times called forth the extraordinary in creation , like a Leviathan . We aboard Angel of Death had my grandfather . I remember Israel joking to me once that if the world really was a stage , then there must be some big parts . Grandfather was a big part . For all his meanspiritedness , he was our deliverer . I learned to believe in him intrinsically . I learned to trust him as a foundation of my faith . I learned to worship him . I thought hard on his warning , irrational as it seemed . What was Greenland to Grandfather ? To the ancient Norse , it had been a desperate refuge , temporary , sad-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and retribution . And what of Grandfather 's talk of arks ? If Sweden was an ark , were there other arks ? And what of his " German wolf " ? There had been a cutter to starboard that afternoon . It might have been German . I had seen no threat . On reconsideration , it had seemed to be monitoring us as we slipped into the North Sea . Later that night , after my talk with Grandfather , we did hear thunder to the east . It might have been gunfire . The next evening , we sighted a group of large trawlers to the north , under power and in concert , suggestively belligerent . The following afternoon , we spied wreckage across a wide front , and passing south of it , thought we saw bloated animal corpses , dogs and cattle . Grandfather came to the railing at the sighting . I asked him what he saw now . Grandfather raised his voice so that Israel and Molly would hear , " There was a battle here . " That evening , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our decision-making for the first time . He urged we change course , making for the Atlantic north of Scotland , what would have been a rugged sail that time of year , huge seas and ice floes . Israel was instantly opposed to Grandfather 's recommendation and said so gruffly , having me translate his English rather than himself addressing Grandfather in Swedish . It was an excessive display of disregard . This exchange is where I mark the beginning of the spiritual battle for control of Angel of Death , a contest in which I would find myself pawn , traitor , and bounty : yes , Grandfather was always in command of the ship , owner and  | captain ; but for those first weeks out of Stockholm , Grandfather was not overlord of his passengers . And this pained him . He listened to my abridged version of Israel 's remarks , and then left the galley . I thought him frustrated ; he was actually maneuvering , biding his time . The council 's resolution  --  approved by our ruling triumvirate of Israel , Guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A British patrol , two well-armed cutters , intercepted us at dawn . The lead ship sent automatic-weapon fire across our bow before hailing us . They made no attempt to communicate on shipto-ship radio . I got topside hurriedly . I relieved Earle at the helm , sent the watch to trim us smartly . Orlando the Black was ready to uncover our fixed automatic weapon , and it was only the quickthinking intervention of Otter Ransom , screaming " No ! No ! " that saved us from an answering barrage . Otter Ransom had been appointed our weapons officer , and this had already caused disagreements with the Furore brothers , who had been obliged to surrender their firearms to the arsenal . Otter Ransom ordered Orlando the Black and Babe below decks , shouted into the hatch that the two convicts we had rescued with Father were to keep everyone out of sight . I note that those two convicts were not idly chosen for their part in the rescue , had once been some of Thord 's best smugglers , a Laplander named Skyeless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandfather came on deck and took charge . We ran up our Swedish flag . Grandfather had Israel bring Molly and Cleopatra up to make us appear a pleasure craft ; Guy came up without permission . The second cutter closed on us at high speed and sent a wake that listed us suddenly . Guy shook his fist . Grandfather said to stand easy . He then cupped his hands and boomed across that we were Swedish nationals , bound for the Americas . The lead cutter flashed a light across our length , pausing at the tarp covering our automatic weapon . A portly officer in a great blue coat appeared with a bullhorn and called across his name , rank , and ship 's nationality . He continued , in a tired way , and warned us not to attempt to land on British soil , including the Channel Islands , and that all British ports were closed to " unauthorized refugees . " Guy screamed out , " What 's authority , then ? " Grandfather nodded in approval and then drowned out the sea with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy , his country , every man who would dare to support a policy that excluded him and his ship . Grandfather demanded to know what right the British Navy had to open fire on a Swedish ship in international waters . The officer , apparently disgusted by his task , but the good seaman throughout , said one word : " Cholera . " We lost the British when we left the Strait of Dover , but soon spied some French cutters to the southwest . We did not want to risk their accuracy across our bow , and kept far north of the Bay of the Seine while at the same time endeavoring to avoid more British patrols . Our task was grueling , given that we were also struggling with the wind and current from the west . It was an anxious Channel passage . There were nights we could see fire to the northeast , either from ships or from the English coast . And Wild Drumrul , who had the best eyes on board , swore he saw an explosion that tore the horizon with red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn we heard the thunder , which we now had reason to assume was gunfire . There was much wreckage and spotty oil slicks that grew into black lakes which coated our bow with greasy seaweed . South of Plymouth , Guy and Orri , on deck watch , said they saw wreckage with people clinging to it . In that rolling sea , it was not possible to maintain an observation station . Soon after , a gale rose sudden and fierce from the southwest  --  our fifth blow since the Skaggerak , but our first serious test as seamen  --  and we were too pressed manning the pumps , shortening sail , making into a heavy sea for four days to care about anyone adrift out there . What few moments we did have , between fighting the sea and sleeping poorly in that sickening pitch and roll , we used to debate the meaning of what we had seen . We agreed that all of northern Europe seemed to fear the disruptions of the Baltic refugees as much as had Stockholm . We supposed that some precautions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overladen trawlers , ancient frigates with decks covered by tents , and ship wreckage to be able to surmise the deadly confusion of populations in pellmell flight . What was not obvious to us was the extent of the exclusion . It was no simple or local policy , much more virulent . We could not see it , not the way Grandfather meant . We had been permit- ted to pass unharmed . We supposed our fate was common . It was luck . I can have no certain knowledge now as to how many ships went down by misadventure , how many were deliberately scuttled by hired crews , how many were sunk by those cutters . I can guess at a pan-European shame . What fooled us , what we permitted to deceive us , was that there was nothing overwhelmingly out-of-the-ordinary on the radio , either ship-to-ship or international , to indicate there was an organized plot . At a council , we listened to Lazarus 's explanation that the larger the conspiracy the more heinous its implications and the more likely it was to be silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't seem a threat , " said Lazarus , " but when everyone says no , it can be a death sentence . " Cleopatra bridled at this . I was surprised , since I had thought Lazarus did no more than express her opinions . She said , " This is the late twentieth century , Lazarus , there are no villains . " Grandfather was hunched in the galley ; he spoke across to me as soon as Gizur translated what Cleopatra had said . " The darkness , Grim . Satan smiles . " We passed into the main lanes south of Lizard Point , still struggling with heavy seas as we made for the Bay of Biscay . We intended to make our Atlantic crossing with the northeast trade winds from the Cape Verde Islands . We sighted numerous gleaming freighters carrying on as usual . Another blow off Ushant made us run seaward , away from a battered-looking frigate that , at a distance , appeared dismasted . We were days beating off that storm , and I think the better for it , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to work together , prepared us for the ordeal ahead . It was not until the end of November that we chanced upon our first unambiguous evidence of outrage . We were east of Cape Finisterre at dawn . I recall it vividly because Earle had urged me up the mainmast to watch a school of phosphorescent fish pass beneath us . Wild Drumrul was already above me , near the top . There , he spied a small vessel adrift up wind to the west . She was also on fire , for within minutes a thickening spume marked her for all on deck to see . Grandfather ordered us about , and we made toward her slowly . We were shocked to see , after half ' an hour , a small niotorcrafi shoot away  | from the derelict and toward the coast just as an explosion ripped the hulk 's bow . Someone had managed to launch a jolly , which did not make for us , just wallowed . There were ten bodies in the jolly , eight dead of smoke and burns , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small man , dying of a mangled torso . The sea about us was strewn with corpses . Tall Troll , who had a worrisome talent for clear thinking in the midst of murder , estimated one hundred bodies , mostly children . We worried about infection . That officer had said " Cholera . " Without agreement , we pulled that survivor on board . He replied to three questions before he died . " Who did this to you ? " asked Lazarus . " They wanted gold ! We have no gold ! We have children ! We need water ! They killed us for gold ! " " Where did you come from ? " asked Lazarus . " The fleet of the damned ! " he said . Israel heard Lazarus 's translation , turned away , looked at me , dark-faced , as if he had been shot , and said , " It 's not possible . It is n't . Not now . " " Where were you bound ? " asked Lazarus . " Water ! They would not give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ! I have cousins ! " Grandfather held him tenderly , prayed over him loudly enough to protect us from hearing his cries . The final question the man answered dead . He was not from the Baltic or northern Europe . He was not Spanish , Moroccan , African Negro . He was a Moslem , Lazarus said , probably a descendant of people originally from what was then the Islamic Republic of Pakistan . He spoke Portuguese . Lazarus guessed he was a refugee from the People 's Republic of Angola . " The fleet of the damned , " we said to each other . Lazarus said this was a crude translation and could also be " ships of the accursed " or " boats of demons . " Wild Drumrul said it would have been the same in Turkish . Orlando the Black added it was the same in Spanish . Guy said it was the same in French . I knew it was the same in Old Norse , Swedish , German . Only in English did it sound stilted , fantastic , hallucinatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most appalling sort of joke  --  completely  | contagious . He also said it was near enough in any language to the unspeakable . We tried not to speak of it as we carried as much sail as possible running the Portuguese trades down the Iberian coast . We slept badly , since we established extra and military round-the-clock watches . Otter Ransom gave lessons on weaponry ; Tall Troll and Skyeless made plans for dealing with boarders . Wild Drumrul lived on the mainmast , eyes set to the east for motorcraft . We were blacked out at night , during the day kept well seaward of the shipping lanes . We remained in this panic until well past Cape Saint Vincent , when we could be reasonably assured we were beyond shore-based boats . Orri upset our supper one night by speaking aloud our worst fantasy , to Thord , though we all heard : " But pirates ? Off Portu-gal ? " Thord shushed him . Guy said it was not possible , said that it was unwise with people with as little information as we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in daylight in the most heavily traveled sea lane in Europe , Ushant to Gibraltar . Grandfather , sitting nearby , reading the Fiddle Bible , listened to Gizur 's translation , then looked accusingly at Guy . Guy returned the stare and said , " It was a freak . " Later , Lazarus took me , Israel , and Guy aside to explain how he had reworked his earlier thesis ; he said that it was well within Europe 's talent to organize a conspiracy of indifference . He grinned in that self-satisfied way of his , brainy , arrogant ; he added that if one took into account the violence of the weather , the sea , disease , and those jackals in the boat , such a conspiracy of indifference could mean murder on a massive scale of all those caught helpless , without a nation , a coastline , an island , a rock to cling to . We sighted Porto Santo , the small island to the northeast of Madeira , at first light on my twenty-second birthday . We were not celebratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to Baja . " Israel overheard this , did not conceal his sigh . We needed water , relief . The sea ran dark and the sky closed about us as we wore away to the west to sight Madeira 's central mountains , shrouded in a dense mist . We intended to clear the stacks on a port tack and come around to the south of Madeira , to anchor at the Fun- chal Roads by nightfall . I was delighted with myself , not because of my birthday , rather because I was improving quickly as Grandfather 's navigator . I had us exactly on course . It was not to he . A Portuguese cutter boomed out of the lee shore of Madeira to intercept us with unmistakable malevolence . Earle hurried Molly below . Grandfather gave an order and we came about for the southwest . In council that night , Israel and Guy took over an hour to reach the same decision Grandfather already had made about our sailing course . I was bothered that they made such a show of their authority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to be able to tell Grandfather what to do . They ordered Grandfather to continue to the southwest . Over the next week , we decided to go on two-thirds rations until the Canary Islands . That was our first defeat , and it invited bad turns . We were baffled by light winds , calms , thick pools of gray ooze that seemed to ride the northwesterly swell . We carefully avoided other traffic . We were a day out of Tenerife , the central island of the Canary group and our destination , when we sighted a large mass of dead fish , including several dozen dolphins , belly up , half rotted , riding the crest of a multicolored stain across our front . A fair wind at our quarter spared us the smell , not our doubts . Lazarus , through Gizur , asked Grandfather if this was unusual . Grandfather replied , " Very old . " Israel tried to start an argument with Grandfather , decrying his black fatalism . Grandfather shrugged . It hurt me to see those two dig at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outclassed Israel . It was the same at Tenerife as it had been at Madeira , with the distinction that one of the two Spanish cutters that came out after us did pass close enough to shout across that we could tie up at the harbor 's breakwater in exchange for gold . They named an astronomical sum and specified it must be gold , not gems or cash money . On bad rations , save Molly and Peregrine , we made for the last landfall feasible before our Atlantic crossing , the Cape Verde Islands , a week to the southwest . Goggle-Eye was the first of us to sicken . Hallverd , the young King 's Spy ( or Evangelical Brigademan ) we had taken with us  --  and had not been able to land ? collapsed with a similar fever soon after , confounding us because  | we assumed Goggle-Eye 's poor health history made him exceptionally susceptible to infection . We continued to boil the water , which cut further into our supply . We argued the problem might be the fish we caught , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and in fear of microbes . If it was cholera , we were finished ; so we assumed otherwise , and no one else got sick . There was still no margin left . Israel and Guy declared at a council that we should not turn away from any Portuguese cutter without a fight . We readied ourselves for a struggle which did not come , at least not as we anticipated . We sighted Sal , the northeastern island of the Cape Verde archipelago , at midmorning , and swung well clear during the day , passing Boa Vista and Maio cautiously . There was nothing but mist , dark seas , quiet . We slid into Port Praia , on the lee shore of the main island , Sao Tiago , at dusk . The silence was representative . The town was in ashes . Lazarus 's spontaneous reaction to the sight of the smoldering wharves ? for Cleopatra 's benefit , but I overheard  --  was that there had been another failed revolution that had consumed itself with blood lust . He said he had heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this must be the latest outbreak . His smugness did not suit the facts . The ruin was total . Studying Sao Tiago , in that dense weather , under the moonlit profile of those volcanic peaks , it was clear to me there had always been famine and turmoil there , even in good years . It was as clear to me that only man could have reduced everything so maliciously . The few victims we spotted camped at the waterline scampered away like vermin . The muggy doom unnerved us . The near shore was littered with dark lumps being picked over by dogs and birds . The evening 's land breeze , as it shifted , poured a stench over us , that sweet , clinging , dizzying smell of death . We moved twice to avoid that stench , finally dropping anchor a hundred yards off an unburned pier . We made our plan quickly : me , the Furore brothers , Otter Ransom , Tall Troll , and Skyeless , plus Iceberg as scout , going ashore in the jolly by relay . We needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my turn in the boat , did not talk with Israel and Guy , who stood behind me mumbling heavily , nor did I acknowledge Earle as he went forward to man the automatic weapon . I thought my conduct appropriate impertinence at the time , expressing my anger at them lot not heeding Grandfather 's advice to try for Amer- ica on a northern route . I see now it was more honestly an expression of disloyalty to my family . When I got ashore , I sent Iceberg ahead . Not one of us was bold enough to pause beneath the banner that some desperate official had strung like a shroud across the pier 's main pylon , which read , in Portuguese , DANGER QUARANTINE . We had vowed we would not be turned away by men , and this meant the diseases of men as well . Lazarus found the other news , once we had gotten off the pier and formed a skirmish line , at Otter Ransom 's direction , to walk into town . Painted in black tar across the concrete sea wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enter into despair . " In English , Lazarus said , that would be " abandon hope . " I thanked Grandfather 's Lord God that it was night , sparing us from seeing most of what a tropical climate  --  we were fifteen degrees north of the equator  --  does to a massacre , for that is what we found . Iceberg growled steadily , her hair up , teeth bared , blood sense alert . We soaked handcloths in Otter Ransom 's whiskey flask and held them to our faces , fended off the flies as best we could . There were survivors , those either too ill or too beaten to have fled . We stayed on the main avenue , making our way by moonlight , listening to the cries , low and not necessarily human . Iceberg marked the rats . We found signs of a battle near the central square , unburied human parts , burned-out vehicles . We did not examine the heap beside the town hall , instead turned away when we saw the main well was poisoned by corpses . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a side street , whose water Tall Troll tasted , pronounced potable . As we filled our casks , a man walked out of one of the huts , right toward us . He was old , withered , drunk . Several other ancients followed him , and they gathered to watch us . Lazarus started a conversation with them . I did not pay mind until our work was done and we were ready to leave . The chief informant gave no name , seemed older than the corpses we had seen . He spoke to me as I approached ; Lazarus translated nearly simultaneously , " This is my ghost . I am dead and buried . " The ancient also answered questions : " They came in howls . There were many , many , like ants . We beat them . Then the sickness . They took our food . They came again . They took every- thing . The shit ! They could not eat our food . They ate it and died . What men can not eat food ? My son , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest said . That Hell was full . Satan has returned them to the earth . From long ago , the priests say , the worst sinners , Pontius Pilate and Judas . They were little . They were hungry . From Hell . That is why they could not eat our food . The priest said . We begged them to leave us . They died . It burned ! It was Satan . Mother of God , our cathedral burned like a stable . Only the shit did not burn . What sort of shit is it ? It moves ! " We ran back to Angel of Death , as fast as I hasten to close this episode . I am hard-pressed , even now , to recall the first shocks of those times . Also , I do not want to dwell on Port Praia , because it was not extraordinary . I can suppose there are accounts of worse elsewhere in the Atlantic that are unavailable to me ; if not , I shall tell things that make that island seem merciful . We gathered our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were ashore . He rolled over in his bunk and melted with fever . Wild Drumrul came to the rail to tell me . I looked to Israel for guidance ; he ignored me , holding Molly close . Peregrine and Charity were of no use to me , remaining huddled below . We stowed our water casks , then wandered about the deck . We talked in spurts , me to Guy , Otter Ransom to Thord , Lazarus to Cleopatra , then we fell into a silence that matched the night 's . Dawn surprised me , a thick soup over the sun , the onshore breeze stirring the cinders in the ruins into new fires . It did seem as if an evil force raced through Port Praia with a torch . That place drained us of desire . If not for Grandfather , we might have laid in anchor until self-pity finished us . That is a dull sort of exhaustion . One can not eat , or drink , or think in a reasonable pattern . Perhaps that is why Grandfather could act so effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present and part in the Sinai , or Palestine , or Babylon , wherever there was a space and time that called forth the prophetic . While we whined about cholera , dysentery , the charnel house that was Port Praia , Grandfather pursued his ministry . He got below , wrapped Goggle-Eye 's body in a blanket , weighted it , prayed loud and long over it , then passed it over the side with a psalm ( 131 in the Fiddle Bible ) : " Lord God , my heart is not proud , nor are my eyes haughty . I do not busy myself with great matters or things too marvelous for  | me . No , I submit myself , I account myself lowly , as this weaned child once clung to its mother . 0 Israel , look for Lord God now and evermore ! " There was a splash . Grandfather sobbed , stood , turned on us , then exploded in a muscular scolding , " You are alive ! Sinners , you live ! " He strode from the bow to the cockpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while one of his children , one of the meekest among us , has not ! If ' we all die now , we have received infinitely more than that poor dear child ever got ! Are you thankless fools ? Clear way ! All hands to stations ! Passengers below ! Make ready the lines ! Up anchor ! And praise Lord God ! Praise him ! " I threw myself at the mainmast and hauled lines in a fit . I wanted to hurt myself , anything to make me feel alive , to make me forget that old man 's , that ghost 's , story , to keep myself from seeing what had probably come to me , a true vision , when that old man had said , " Hell was full . " So I worked , shouted orders , helped Wild Drumrul with the anchor . We all scrambled over Angel of Death , feeding on the energy that was Grandfather . We left the harbor in a daze . The sea was up , and we were rocked hard with double-crossing waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were deep reports to the west , not gunfire this time , thunderclaps across the sea . We knew we were heading into a storm . We were for it . We had to clear Port Praia . We wanted bad weather to wash off some of that rot . I understand now that I was in some sort of mind-fever  --  another hint of the shape-changing that would overwhelm me later in life  --  which I did not come out of until I paused to pull on my foul-weather gear . While I was in the gangway , Cleopatra came up behind me suddenly . Her eyes were red , her face glowed with a beauty and a fear I remember now as her very nature . It was certainly one of the things that made me love her . The truth , Grim Fiddle says , is that she was my graven image . I stopped before her like a pagan . I started to weep , for Goggle-Eye , for Port Praia , for us . It is the first instance I can recall that we shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge that we were too young , and that there were things in heaven and earth that we had never imagined . She broke the spell , asking , " Lazarus wo n't , ca n't . What did you find ? " " I ca n't either . I just can't. "  | " It is important , Grim . Tell me what you saw . Who did that ? You know . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Why wo n't you tell me ? " " What do you want me to do , describe that ? Who did it ? Do n't ask me , do n't ask me again ! " I raised up . I raised my hand . And why ? Earle must have been watching us ; he was instantly there , stepping between , turning her away , blocking me with the same enormous backside that had given me privacy at conception . A swell took the ship , throwing me to the deck . I rolled over and got topside , remained there daylong , driving myself , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fair-equal temper . It was exhilarating , rejuvenating , and up there I regretted my transgression . I was ashamed of how I had acted with Cleopatra , because I understood that when I had made ready to strike her , her imperious demands , it had not been Cleopatra I was striking out to silence , it had been my own prodigy . I had panicked rather than confront what I saw clearly for what it was the moment she forced me to think . I saw that Port Praia had been destroyed by the exiles and refugees who called themselves the fleet of the damned . Only Grandfather 's metaphor is appropriate to the tempest that swallowed us southwest of Port Praia . We sailed into oceanic valleys of the shadow of death . We had the force of several gales over the deck and were picked up and carried along the crest of the waves like a twig ; if we had fallen off line just a touch we would have gone over . I recall one moment that overwhelmed me : I was struggling at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden I looked up to see what I thought were clear skies to the cast . I called to Grandfather and the rest , that we were saved , that the storm was broken . Grandfather cat- apulted into the cockpit , wiped his eyes clear of caked salt , and looked up to where I pointed . He straightened gracefully , then he raised his arms high and screamed , " A fine laugh , Satan ! " I saw my error . What I had thought were white clouds marking a break in the weather was in fact the white crest of a cliffside of water . Angel of Death shot up that wall , dipped hard at the top , then plunged again toward the center of the sea . There were times , as we rode up and down those canyons , that I hoped for an end , relief , release from that vast tomb of salt water . I kept my station , held to life by a power that I realized would let me go when and if it chose . Grandfather told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I puzzle now if it was not a welcome into our time in the wilderness . We nearly lost Skyeless on the second day , which was Christmas 1995 , as a rogue wave crashed over us , with him and Orri at the boom ; only luck and a lifeline saved him , half insane from being snapped back from his grave , his leg smashed up . We did lose Hallverd , the King 's Spy , on the fifth day : delirious with fever , he charged on deck and threw himself off the stern ; a wave caught him in midair and drove him back half the length of the ship before it pulled him under . We lost the top of our foremast on the seventh day . The sea still whirled as the sky raged , lightning bolts like claws leaping as if from wave crest to wave trough ? an illusion that was magnificent and awful . By the ninth day , the first day of 1996 , we could not pull ourselves to duty on the foredeck . Grandfather lashed himself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns holding his legs to provide him leverage against the rudder . We gave ourselves up to fate . Grandfather did not sleep ; he prayed , he sang psalms , he argued with his Lord God : " You should not abandon us here ! We have not begun to suffer ! We are vain sinners ! What purpose my work if this is an end ? I must deliver him from their ways ! Satan can not take me ! I feel your hand cradling me ! Test me , break me ! I shall not relent ! " When the storm did break , we were straddling the equator , approximately one thousand miles from Africa and a little less from South America . The waves poured us like debris into an unholy heat . With Babe 's help , I untied Grandfather and pulled him below . Cleopatra helped us undress him , wash him , lay him  | out to sleep . We were too exhausted to talk , collapsed in our own berths . I do not know how many days it took us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Wild Drumrul , asleep on deck to avoid the swelter below , who first smelled the smoke ; unless it was Iceberg and Goldberg and their pups up top , also to escape the heat , who licked Wild Drumrul to alarm . He awoke me , screaming in broken German , " The fire ! The sea is on fire ! " We awakened Guy , Israel , and Thord , and we five stood aghast at the stern . It was midmorning , the sea nearby like green glass . Above , the sky was whitish blue with the heat . And before , at a great distance to the west , there was a shimmering fire line , subtending a ninety-degree angle . A thin smoke hugged the water in the near distance , and as we watched it curled across the sea to wash over us in the light breeze that fluttered our single sheet , then died . The calm was complete . The view was unconvincing , another illusion , and one had to turn away and look again , several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire line there , like ragged red crystal between the green blue sea and the pale blue sky . We drifted in the strong westerly current toward the burning sea . At twilight , no indication of a wind from any quarter , all of us save Peregrine , Charity , and Grandfather gathered on deck to lounge before that terrible beauty . " Water can not burn , " said Wild Drumrul to me . " Is it the coast ? " asked Israel . " I do n't think we can see that far , " I said . " Water can not burn , " said Wild Drumrul to Israel . Full night displayed the Magellanic Cloud above and a spectacular seascape below , the fire starkly clear . We were still dazed from the storm , so I suppose more available to hypnotism . It did not occur to us to think of jeopardy . There was not a harsh word all day . It was Grandfather , emerging past midnight , surly and mighty again , who upset us , especially me . He paced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another private conference . " Greenland ! You have not declared yourself , " he said . " I ca n't do it , please , you see , " I tried . " Knowing what I have said is true ? We might have a chance . "  | " This is my family . You are my family . You said that to fight for what is mine is not wrong . " " Lord God is angrier than I had thought , " he said . " Do you know what that is ? " I asked , pointing to the fire . " You know ! " he boomed , springing to the mainmast to preach . " You all know what you see ! My children , how long will you not see ? You lie there beaten , even as you are sucked into the maelstrom . " " A fire storm ! " said Israel , standing up in excitement as I translated Grandfather 's idioms . " That is what . Old man , you are crazy , but you do see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says we 're in the doldrums . The variables . It 's where the junk collects , right ? An enormous stagnant pond , between the winds and currents of the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic . That junk , it 's been ignited into a fire storm , fed by waste . " " That 's farfetched , " said Guy . " So were those pirates . So was Praia , " said Israel . Gizur told Grandfather what they had said ; Grandfather stamped the deck . " Your godless science and your perversions have blinded you . Look again , then pray for our delivery from such evil . " " It is Satan , " said Gizur , who had fallen under Grandfather 's spell more than any of us , his mind weakened , now crumbling . " That does n't help anyone , Gizur , that nonsense , " said Israel . " Accursed Jew ! " said Grandfather . " None of that , " said Thord , moving to shelter poor Gizur . " Unrepentant Sodomite ! " said Grandfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! Satan has torn creation open ! There 's the wound ! Perdition ! " Guy , Israel , and Thord collected forward to confer . I sensed their digust with Grandfather . It was deserved . He had quit decency again , permitting his genius for metaphorical persuasion ? which supported his superhuman resolve in a crisis  --  to become distorted in the calm , moving him to cruelty , hysteria . It was much the same distortion that had carried him from the Gulf of Bothnia to the pulpit of the Pillar of Salt to the near dictatorship of the North . I saw this , and tried the impossible , to give my loyalty to two irreconcilable parties . " Whatever it is , " I began , " it must feed on the wind . I f we try  | for the trades to the Caribbean , we have to risk being dragged into that . It blocks us . We should n't go back there . " " It is Satan , Grim , " said Grandfather . " Shut up , old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pity 's sake , act , " spoke up Cleopatra . " What good is your talk ? " As Gizur explained her words Grandfather clapped his hands , well pleased with Cleopatra . We stood there gripped by her cold , obvious fact . Either we found the wind and sailed out of that calm , or the back draft of the fire storm would drag us into the burning sea . We had less choice than I had presented . Grandfather thundered forth Psalm 100 , " Acclaim the Lord , all men on earth , worship the Lord in gladness , enter his presence with songs of exultation , know that the Lord is God ! " pausing between his bursts to order us to launch Black Crane and the jolly , to take to oars in teams , and , in Grandfather 's words , to tow Angel of Death " free of the fumes of Hell . " " Pull , children ! " Grandfather cried from the bow . " Until you know perdition when you see it , pull ! Until you fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull ! " And I remember this : while I was going out to my shift and Lazarus was returning from his , I overheard him and Cleopatra ; she pointed to the burning sea and asked , " Could there have been a war ? " It was an idea that had not occurred to me , for I was ignorant of Lazarus 's so-called political science . I waited to hear Lazarus say , " Nothing so easy , wilder , no explanation , none , " and then he slumped to her . We did catch the wind , after three days of rowing that wore us down badly and broke Earle 's health . Grandfather thereupon proclaimed his own counsel . Hell was behind us , he said , he would not go back , and as master of Angel of Death , he would not risk proceeding east or west into the trades without trying for a landfall to mend the foremast and other minor damage that would worsen in a blow . At our council there was a bitter argument about Grandfather 's fitness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts to assist their decision . Guy wanted to go back , arguing the fire would burn out ; Israel was wary of another calm , and equally of another storm . I told them we were three degrees south of the equator . 1f we were to continue without repairs , our choices  | were : either make for the southeast trades and ride the Benguela Current into an African port along the Gulf of Guinea , risking pirates and cutters ; or to ride the trades across the Atlantic to catch the Brazil Current and , bypassing American ports for the same reason we should avoid Africa , try for the Pacific via the Strait of Magellan , the legendary grave of all ill-crewed , illequipped ships . I pressed them that making for the southwest seemed safest , and mending our foremast beforehand seemed most prudent . Grandfather 's preference for a landfall midocean had two possibilities : either Saint Paul 's Rocks to our northwest , an uninhabited desolation ; or Ascension Island to the southeast , a British naval station that might be as hostile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied , then gave a qualified assent to Ascension for repairs , saying that only then would they decide whether we went west , east , or back north . This was good caution ; it was bad luck . Making for Ascension was another defeat . I am unsure if there were better choices ; still , there might have been some other way than I was able to formulate , some other way that I could not see , that would have carried us back inside civilization . I stress this ; it is not exaggeration . We knew we were in absolute peril , though we deceived ourselves , though we had known it since first we heard the word cholera . It was not something we were strong enough to share at meals . How does one say , " I think we are lost " ? I could place us on the chart . Yet we were lost . Somehow , at some point , for a reason I do not yet comprehend ( a mystery that compels this story ) , we on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reason , decency , privilege , common sense , and security to the outside of civilization , where there was no sense , only terror , silence , worse upon worse . Did it happen in Stockholm harbor when we stole Peregrine ? Did it happen when we obeyed the exclusion by the cutters and fled ? Did it happen when we ignored the massacre of children off Portugal ? Did it happen when we walked through Port Praia in a nightmare ? Did it happen when we survived a tempest that would have destroyed us except for Grandfather 's bravado and our luck ? Had we failed and were we condemned , had we dared and were we trapped , or had we stumbled and were  | we being tempted ? It was this : We were lost to what we had had , by fortunate birthright , back in Sweden and America ; and it became necessary to find a new life that was outside , other , incredible . If there was a greatest Good , it was no longer for us . A week of rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had closed about us , and the rains were down in sheets , solving our fresh-water problem but keeping us at the pumps . We beat up hard toward where Ascension should have been . A sharp squall picked us up , drove us southward . I was not yet a certain navigator , but good enough to tell Grandfather that unless I was backward , Ascension should be to the east when the weather broke . It was not , more fog and rain . We took a new tack , listened for a foghorn , watched for lights . I reworked my figures . It was twilight , and I was going topside to admit my miscalculations again , when , simultaneously , Wild Drumrul cried , " Land to port ! " and we heard the screams . Did we hear anything ? Did we see anything ? I must explain that I was assuming that we had missed Ascension during the night . I blamed the squall for driving us more south than I had been able to determine : our instruments were antique , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern heavens were new to me and Grandfather ) , I was mostly guessing . When Wild Drumrul cried , " Land to port , " I quickly supposed that the land he sighted was not Ascension , was rather uninhabited volcanic formations , of the sort that poke up from the mid-Atlantic ridge , treacherous for uninformed sailors like us . The screams dumbfounded us . The half-moon gave enough light to risk a pass close to the lee of the largest visible peak . Wild Drumrul cried again , this time a new surprise , " Light to port ! " He identified the source as a ship at anchor a mile off the rocks . We scrambled to a new tack to take us toward the light . As we came about , there were more screams . We strained our eyes into the dark . We could make out a natural harbor , shaped by two hornstone ridges slanting down into the sea . In that cove appeared a heap of man-made things  --  boats , barges , rafts , frigates . The waves jammed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , some ripping open , some slipping underwater . We studied the ridges for signs of the crews and pas- sengers . The rocks were barren of vegetation . There were no campfires . I called to Wild Drumrul that he must see signs of life . There were none . There were more screams . " The wind , through the rocks , it 's possible , " said Israel . " Speak your blind lies , Jew , " said Grandfather , ordering us to shorten sail . " I can see them ! " cried Gizur to Orri , pointing to the rocks . There was nothing to see . That is accurate . Yet when I swung free of our foresail , I did see something . I asked Babe with a shrug . Though he was deaf , he nodded yes . I asked Little Dede Gone ; he ran to his brother . I went back to Grandfather . Angel of Death caught the wind and listed . Cleopatra came up top with Lazarus . They were arguing . I turned to them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chorus in pain . " What is it ? " said Cleopatra , more to me than Lazarus . " Port of the damned , " said Lazarus . He was angry . I understand now that he was jealous of me . " You do n't believe that , " I said to Lazarus . " Those are just derelicts piled up here by the storms . " " And you do n't believe that , " said Lazarus . Orlando the Black swung down beside us . He looked stern . He spoke patiently . " I see three sharp ridges forming a peak . Ocean , and clouds over the moon . Flotsam and jetsam . That is all . Grandfather ordered us to stations ; we came about one more time . Otter Ransom and Tall Troll readied for combat . We chose not to talk more of those screams , of those shapes and figures on those rocks , which none of us saw , which we only thought we saw , which we sensed . The ancient Norse held that an unburied corpse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out the living , can walk and talk and scream , for retribution , for their regrets . Did we see the dead ? We were exhausted , frightened , lost . It was the wind . We did see that lone ship 's light . They said they were missionaries . Their ship was a badly dilapidated cargo bomb , nearly a century old , a wooden hull , four masts for sail , and aged diesel engines added at some point in a makeshift reconditioning . It was named The Free Gift of God , out  | of Luanda , which Lazarus told me was the capital of the People 's Republic of Angola . At our first pass , several of the missionaries appeared on the forecastle , robed , ebullient , and threw us greetings in English and Portuguese , holding up a crude wooden cross , calling " Hallelujah ! " We chose to drop anchor off a small rock formation at a good distance from the freighter 's stern , wary of the tide and unseen rocky teeth . Once we had anchored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to resight our position . I remember no special shock at my discovery that the land behind us was indeed Ascension Island , marked on my charts as populated by four hundred people . " I never doubted it , " said Grandfather when I told him . I did not go in the jolly with our lead party of Israel , Guy , and the Furores . The Furore brothers returned within the hour in dismal moods . Lazarus said the missionaries seemed Roman Catholic mendicants , a lay order , possibly a rogue order . They offered us assistance and what supplies they had . Lazarus also said they behaved strangely , as if none of what we were witnessing was out-of-the-ordinary . Lazarus said that Israel wanted me , Grandfather , Otter Ransom , Tall Troll , and Wild Drumrul to row over in Black Crane as soon as possible . The Furores brought back with them two of the missionaries : a thin , old man of mixed blood , Father Hospital ; and a nimble , middle-aged , very dark Negro , Father Novo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible British-English , were dressed in heavy robes and skullcaps , and carried ornate crucifixes . The first thing they did was to announce they were ready to hear our confessions as a prelude to offering Holy Communion . Father Hospital asked me if anyone was in need of the sacrament of the last rites . I translated all this for Grandfather . " I 'll have none of that on my ship ! " said Grandfather . " Are you in need of absolution , my son ? " Father Hospital said to Grandfather . Grandfather scowled at him , waved him back as he gave orders to lower away Black Crane . I explained to the fathers that we were mostly unchurched , but that my grandfather was a pastor in the Swedish Lutheran Church . They smiled pleasantly . I could see what Lazarus meant by peculiar . I asked Father Iospital , " What happened to Ascension ? " " We are doing Christ 's work , " he said , going below abruptly .  | I pursued , found him greeting Charity and Peregrine . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me li and said , " Be careful . " Father Hospital and I went up again , came li upon Lazarus explaining to Cleopatra what he thought of The Free Gift of God . She called over Father Hospital and Father Novo Pedro , then tried to interrogate them : how long had they been here , where had they come from , what they hoped to accomplish . They replied with fragments of mystical evasiveness until Father Hospital took Cleopatra 's hand , asked her how long it had been since she had made confession . Cleopatra answered flatly , " Five years , " and then she lowered her head and added , " and one month . " It had not occurred to me that she had been raised Roman Catholic . I did realize then that she had made her last confession before her father 's murder . Before we got down into Black Crane , Lazarus took me aside . I was pleased he seemed to trust me ; he had not wanted to tell Cleopatra everything , yet needed someone to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " These people , refugees maybe , are down below . We kept clear of the hatches . There is something wrong . " I recognized a deep agitation in Lazarus , fear mixed with disgust , and I touched him in sympathy . He pushed me away . I noticed that Grandfather was also agitated . He made the two missionaries sit before him in Black Crane , told them through Gizur not to talk to his crew . As we shoved off , I mentioned to Lazarus my puzzlement at what could have moved Israel to send for Grandfather . The answer was that The Free Gift of God was an open grave . It reeked of human waste and putrefaction . We staggered aboard using a cargo net flung over from a plank at the waist . Other missionaries greeted us , more pleasantries and polite invitations , particularly to a chapel on the foredeck . Grandfather rebuffed them with a blast . We found Israel and Guy on the quarterdeck ; they looked stunned , ashen , terrified . Israel said that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they had interviewed the missionaries ' leader , Father Saint Stephen . " They 're all insane , " said Israel . " They pray over them , " said Guy . " You should see it below , hundreds of people ! And foodstuffs ! In crates , anything you want , medicine , tools , grain . It sits there , rotting , for the rats ! They pray over them . Some of those things down there have torn at the  | crates . Nothing is being done ! You ask them why they do n't feed them , and nothing ! " " They say they 're doing Christ 's work , " I said . At this , Grandfather turned to Otter Ransom , said , " Secure Black Crane . Clear the deck of those priests . None of them near your men . You and Tall Troll get below and mark the goods still worthwhile . Check that hoist . " There was a pause , Otter Ransom looking to see if Israel agreed . Guy said , in a pale protest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us whatever we wanted . Grandfather ignored Israel and Guy , pointed to the mast behind us , told Orlando the Black , " Find an ax and get that down . I 'll want the top forty feet . " " You ca n't do that ! " said Israel to Grandfather directly , in Swedish . " How long have they been here ? " said Grandfather . " They did n't say , " said Israel , in English to me . " This ship will never leave this anchorage , " said Grandfather . " Reason with him , " Israel told me . I struggled with a translation of Israel 's concerns . " Where is this priest who has frightened you children ? " said Grandfather . Israel balked , straining to understand Grandfather 's withering Swedish . Grandfather continued , " You think him as mad as me , is that so , Jew ? Now you need me . Not because you deserted your country and lived where you were not wanted , not because you forced me to save a fiend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because you see the darkness that you have cowered in for decades , and you begin to see what it has come to . To this ! I do not intend to hold you up . And I would not help you or your Sodomites if not that you have filled my Grim with a child 's need of you , and you use him against me . Look hard , Jew . This ship is no Babylon . At most , it is a hole for Balaam . You are a small , weak , cowardly , unrepentant , faithless man . Show me this priest you fear . I shall show you what he is , and that he is as sane as me , and more sane than you ! " Israel was stiff with rage . Guy tried to soothe him . Grandfather bellowed at Orlando the Black about how to cut the mast for use on Angel of Death . This was a naked display of his lack of limits , his cruelty . He dizzied us . We stumbled about him : Guy begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black con- ferring secretly in opposition to everyone . Father Novo Pedro appeared and saved us further misery , saying that his brother , Father Saint Stephen , begged a meeting with " the Lutheran . " When I told him , Grandfather clapped his hands , told me to follow , was gone with Father Novo Pedro . I looked to Guy , who said I could go , he would take charge on deck . I said that even I could not handle Grandfather when he was like this . Lazarus surprised me by saying he would accompany me , touching his belt oddly , threateningly . Israel pushed Guy away , looked at me and Lazarus , disdainful of our concern for him , saying , " I 'm not afraid of that bully ! I 've got more backbone than any fanatic . " Israel led me and Lazarus into the gangway . He stopped abruptly , turned to me , defensive , tense . I sensed he was competing for me , and I felt sad for it . He told me that he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited Grandfather over here , that only the shock of what they had found could explain his stupidity . He said Grandfather was a savage man , capable of any crime . He felt responsible for protecting these pathetic people from him . Israel was in a killing mood himself . I had watched him deteriorate since Stockholm . I am ashamed now that I had become more trusting of Grandfather 's patriarchal brutality than Israel 's enlightened humanity . To be fair to Israel , Molly 's pregnancy was a disabling fact . Israel seemed to suffer more than she with each new peril . Several times I came upon him belowdecks sitting with Peregrine and Charity ; he was pale , weepy , withdrawn , seemingly inconsolable . I had tried to conceal that I was increasingly suspicious of his opinions . I was not the only one to waver before Israel 's weaknesses . Guy and Lazarus openly challenged him at our councils , even Earle  --  whose broken health undermined Guy 's confidence in the same way Molly 's listlessness did Israel 's  --  spoke against Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought what was happening to us  --  what I have described as falling from the inside to the outside  --  made no sense , was neither a judgment of us nor inevitable . He said he did not hate Grandfather , nor did he blame him for our condition ; he said that he was certain the opposition he had encountered all his life was not organized , nor of a piece , nor did it have a face . He also denied my talk of luck . He said , " I keep going , we keep on , because we believe we 're decent and right  | and honest . There is no protection for us if we lose that conviction . That will be the end . " I wonder now about that man , Israel Elfers , who loved me from that first moment I lay in Earle 's arms in THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB , who helped to raise me happily , who taught me what he believed in above all else  --  decency  --  who played the gentle uncle for me so effortlessly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vexbeggar that I appreciated what a gift it is to have such parenting : ever patient , ever earnest , never ponderous or heavyhanded . Israel talked to me continually as I grew up . He drenched me with wit , wisdom , and plain fun . When I think of him now , I think of a man in motion , hands waving , eyes darting , a flood of talk  --  an endless monologue . Israel talked most easily when musing about himself . And before any other kind of portraiture , he described himself as a Jew . A man 's idea of himself has weight . Israel 's idea was that he was first , always , lastly , a Jew . He also said he was both profoundly comforted and profoundly worried by his birthright . He toyed with the word chosen , as in the Jews being God 's chosen people . For a quirk that I never penetrated , Israel laughed every time he said that God had chosen the Jews . I can guess that it suggested an irony to him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatic stories he told about the struggles of the Jews since , as he said , God exiled them from Eden , abandoned Adam and Eve to homelessness and temptations . Indeed , so many of the best stories I remember from childhood were Israel 's parables about fantastic Jewish reversals , epic Jewish displacements , beastly Jewish persecutions , that I suspect that much of my ability to confront the sorrow in my story derives not from my Norse learning , rather from my borrowings and innovations of what Israel told me of Jewish history . Yet there is more to say of him , and there was more mystery to him , than whatever he finally meant to communicate with the idea of Jewishness . He was smart , cagey , kindhearted , political , secretive , motherly , childlike , all things to all he loved , and he loved everyone whom he could tease and who appreciated , even acknowledged , his jokes . There were always those jokes  --  ridiculous word-games , absurd puns , excited displays of farce involving costumes , props , masquerade masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him , the jester , the man who could always make me laugh . Beyond that , it did not come to me until after he was gone from me , forever , that his pranks and cracks and gamesmanship were his way of struggling with the despair that threatened him as an exile and that had dragged Peregrine down to his crime . Israel once told me that he thought tragedy was too easy to be deep wisdom , all one had to do was pull up a chair and moan about betrayal , hatred , slaughter , and get the audience to weep at the meaninglessness of murdered innocence . It was comedy , Israel declared , that was the sublime endeavor ; for one to get that same audience to laugh in the face of defeat or at their own fears , that was a worthy challenge . Israel told me , " Make laughter , Grim , and you make reason . " Israel stopped laughing at Port Praia . What undid him were his tears for Molly 's helplessness and his inability to love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life laughing and making laughter . His weakness was that he had not learned how to cry and at the same time remain balanced and resolute . I understand why ; I rush to excuse . His life had been endless adversity . He had been obliged to reach for laughter again and again , straining to smile , wearing out his humor . He had emptied of smiles . His cup filled with tears . He would not drink it . He thought it poison . He was right . Still , I have learned that one must risk the drink , try endurance . Israel must have intuited this , yet he could not make himself accept sorrow as a meaningful theme . Lost in darkness , he denied the darkness . This might explain his frustration and rage with Grandfather , who could seem the sponsor of the very darkness Grandfather warned against . This might explain more completely Israel 's rage at Grandfather  --  he must have thought it appalling that Grandfather could seem to be winning me to his way of seeing . Israel must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , that he was right to believe in laughter and that Grandfather was wrong to sing woe . That was why I followed Israel so close behind in the gangway . He was murderously determined to disprove , to undo , Grandfather . We missed a turn , another , were some few minutes finding our way . We finally had to follow the sound of Grandfather 's voice . There was laughter . I opened the cabin door to duck into an  | austere , shadowy tableau , half a dozen men in sooty robes seated about a bare table , among them Grandfather , his back to me , his hands spread before him as if he were gesturing in conversation . The light was from a cluster of candles . The smell was incense , barely covering the stench from below . Grandfather continued to speak right at a man who was not as old , nor as hairless , nor as thin , nor as agonized as I had thought he would be . Father Saint Stephen seemed , in his soft piety , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest the Roman Catholic Church , in my readings , favored as voice and authority . However , he was not an ordinary religionist . Indeed , I can make the good guess now that he was an Englishman  --  his manner , his accent , his contrived passion . He was certainly not an opposite to Grandfather . They shared egotistical discipleship , bore their burdens with pridefulness and impiety . It was Father Saint Stephen whom we had heard laugh , joined by his brethren ; they thought Grandfather 's Lutheranism an amusement . " What of their empires ? " said Grandfather in German , who did not seem to take offense at their laughter  --  because , I now suppose , he thought them also due condescension . " That is the reward , is n't it , Reverend Fiddle ? " said Father Saint Stephen , speaking a careful German , looking up to welcome us with a smile . He gestured that we be given benchroom at the table . Israel marched forward , said , in English , though his German was adequate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and go . " Tell the Jew what you have told me , " said Grandfather . " Where are you bound ? " said Father Saint Stephen in excellent and aristocratic British-English . He spoke with the care , tact , dispassion , of an accomplished intellectual . I can also guess now that he had never been poor in his life  --  he was perfect as the mendicant , which I take as meaning he was playing a part he had chosen , that had not fallen to him . Father Saint Stephen held himself like a painting : original , cold , sincere , calculated . Israel answered flatly , " Mexico . " Father Saint Stephen continued , " We have heard stories about the Caribbean . The poor souls spoke of their revolution . The Americans are said to have taken a complete vengeance . You are  | American ? I do not reproach . They made slaves to build their towers of Babel . Now that the cities rise over the plains  --  purple , is it , or golden  --  they have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same east and west . Is this news to you ? These are the last days . " Israel reacted oddly to this ; he seemed to be talking to himself when he said , " I do n't know what you are . " Father Saint Stephen said to Israel , " My son , we are servants of God . " Israel repeated , " I do n't know what you are . " Grandfather interrupted to say that the Jew was a fool ; there was no use telling him anything . Grandfather added that he would appreciate it if Father Saint Stephen could explain the mission of The Free Gift of God to his grandson . He introduced me . Father Saint Stephen began in German . I shook my head no , and he continued in English . " Your grandfather has set me a difficult task . I introduce myself as did the gospel-writer John , I am a voice , crying out in the wilderness , " Make the Lord 's path straight . " ' " Father Saint Stephen continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , " When Our Lord returned from Jordan , he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness for forty days , where he was tempted by Satan three times . Jesus carried no food . He grew weak and angry and afraid in his hunger . Satan challenged Jesus to demonstrate his power by turning a stone to bread . Jesus was not a little tempted , because he loved his life . Jesus took courage , and told Satan that he would never be so hungry as to follow a suggestion made by Satan . " Satan saw that Jesus was a stubborn , soldierly antagonist . Satan conjured up a kingdom on the wasteland , of utter splendor and power on earth , and challenged Jesus that if he just paid the smallest allegiance to Satan , perhaps crush an insect like this creature here " ? Father Saint Stephen plucked up a cockroach ? " that Satan would make Jesus king of that shimmering realm . Jesus studied the towers and gems and beautiful bodies , and was not a little tempted , because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures in his life , because he was ambitious for more than he had as a carpenter and pilgrim . Jesus took courage , and told Satan that he had only to worship God , and God alone , and  | a kingdom the like of which the earth would never see would be his to enjoy . " Satan saw that Jesus was sly as well as learned , devoted , and trusting in the future as few men are in times of catastrophe . Satan took Jesus by the hand and led him to a precipice that we can suppose hung over the pit of Hell . Satan challenged Jesus to leap into the pit , for , said Satan , if Jesus was the son of God then surely his Father would send angels to catch him as he fell , and surely the angels would obey for fear that a hair on Jesus ' body " ? Father Saint Stephen singed the back of his wrist on a candle ? " should be damaged . Jesus looked down into the pit . He was tempted a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he was young and healthy and had confidence in his physical fortitude , and much more than when Satan offered the kingship of pleasure palaces , because Jesus was faithful and knew that the kingdom he had set out to establish made Satan 's construction seem sandstone caves . The third time Jesus was tempted to his limit , because he himself wanted to know if God , his Father , loved him as completely as he had been told , because he wanted to know if the angels were quick , because he wanted to know that he could not fall were he deliberately to throw himself into the pit of Hell . Jesus stepped to the edge and raised his arms , prepared to dive . And then he took courage , and then he laughed . Without looking back at Satan , Jesus said that he did not need to test God , his Father , further than this , and that he felt ashamed that he had tested God this far . Jesus said , I have been forty days with you , Satan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still want to live . You are evil incarnate , yet I am still capable of laughter and play . ' Jesus flapped his arms as a child imitates a bird . Satan withdrew from Jesus , to bide his time . " Father Saint Stephen stood , went to the cabin door , opened it , pointed toward the gangway that I presumed led below decks . He waited while I summed up quickly for Grandfather what he had said . Grandfather nodded approvingly . Israel suddenly grabbed my arm and asked me to get out of there with him right away . I did not answer . I confess I was too hungry for knowledge of God and man , to leave then , as I should have . I was tempted by Father Saint Stephen 's story , and wanted  | more , wanted also to test my faith in God and Grandfather and Israel and my own sense of decency . I did not think then , and certainly do not now , that Father Saint Stephen was a devil . Nor was he an evil man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had read the Gospels for his own purposes , the way good and bad men have done since Paul , and though Father Saint Stephen 's interpretations ( or misinterpretations , his black , black exegesis that I shall present as best I recall ) had led him and his brethren to vertiginously bad judgments , Father Saint Stephen 's opinions were still grounded in a compelling parable , Jesus ' temptation in the wilderness . In that sweltering , rolling cabin aboard The Free Gift of God , in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , Father Saint Stephen 's sermon offered me raw revelation of what we had chanced upon in the world . Father Saint Stephen continued to me , " That is what happened in those forty days , my child . Think hard that Satan withdrew when he failed to tempt Jesus to damnation , yet also that Satan is said to have bided his time . " Father Saint Stephen explained that since that day in the wilderness , twenty centuries of blasphemous critics had attacked Jesus ' courage . These critics had declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or machine , for bread , power , and security . The critics said Jesus lacked pity , that he arrogantly presumed mankind was as strong as he . The critics said that mankind was desperately eager to forge even one kingdom on the sand to secure peace and prosperity , and that Jesus was irresponsible and pretentious to refuse Satan 's proffered kingdom , for Jesus then could have provided , however incompletely , some measure of love and health for mankind . Father Saint Stephen identified the worst of the critics , the Russians , the Germans , the English , and the Americans , who he said were " the weaklings of the north , impatient and reckless . " These in particular claimed that there was so little goodness in the world , the world had become so inhuman , that a leap into Hell might be the only way to test if God still lives . They claimed that if Jesus had doubts enough to accompany Satan to the precipice , then who are we , sad sinners , to presume that God loves us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their at- tacks to usurp Jesus ' power . Father Saint Stephen said they had announced they could nurture mankind better than Jesus ever had . They had established vast earthly empires that had knitted into one kingdom , filled with towers of Babel , offering food and weapons of security to the multitudes . And the rulers of this blasphemous kingdom had told the servants of God that mankind had no more need of God or knowledge of God . They say that God is a hypothesis that has proved unnecessary . Father Saint Stephen said that the " obvious " has happened . He said that Satan had bided his time and continued to tempt men , and finally in the late twentieth century he had triumphed . The blasphemous kingdom had fallen under Satan 's control in exchange for food , power , security . It was not enough for Satan . Satan reviled any man who continued to hunger for more than bread , who continued to turn from earthly power for obedience to heavenly wealth , who continued to refuse to test God and his angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had cast out of the blasphemous kingdom . He said that these outcasts were easy to identify , they were " obviously " the most meek , the most wretched , the slaves , the ones for whom God sent Jesus . " You ask what happened at Ascension Island , " said Father Saint Stephen . " The same that has happened in the Caribbean , aflame with race war , or in the Pacific , where there are famine , tyranny , massacres . Satan slaughters the faithful . It is not enough he has cast them out , now he tempts them to damnation , and they , starving , brutalized , emptied of trust , sin in despair . They flee . How can one hide from Satan ? " And what is to be done ? " asked Father Saint Stephen . " Here we are , in a ship we acquired by begging , filled with goods we begged for , because we thought we could nurse these outcasts back to the Lord 's straight path . We are not the only ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our agony of good works , we were overwhelmed and exhausted . If you had seen what happened here ! Thousands ! We prayed for guidance ! Reverend Fiddle , you know , you understand ! And then there was revelation and mystery ! " Jesus has come into our hearts , " said Father Saint Stephen , smiling , sighing , gesturing , " to inform us that he has loved his children steadfastly for twenty centuries . He has not forgotten his promise to take us into the Kingdom of Heaven . He knew , how- ever , that if he took us directly into God 's love before we had suffered a time in the wilderness , as he had , then we would never understand how magnificent is the Kingdom of God . Jesus has permitted us to suffer , with our free will , to turn from Jesus to Satan . Why ? Because he wanted his children to learn the truth that men will live entirely for food , power , security  --  but that none of this will ever be satisfying ! Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces and enjoy near immortality and never know fear . " Father Saint Stephen paused again . I could see he was pleased with his sermon . He asked if we would like a tour of the hold . Did we want to see what mankind 's freedom and learning had brought ? Israel lowered his head rather than meet that man 's eyes . They shone with an ethereal recklessness . " My brothers and I have discovered , " said Father Saint Stephen , hand in the air dramatically , " that the most supreme obedience to Our Lord Jesus Christ is not to feed men , not to assist men in establishing order , not to minister to men when they stumble . We have discovered that the goods in our hold , the learning in our minds , the sacraments we can offer to baptize , or marry , or ordain men to continue their lives  --  that all this is no longer righteous . We have discovered that Jesus is in our hearts telling us it is time , now , immediately , these last days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving way . The Lord 's straight path stands revealed . It is death to this sinful world . We celebrate the most courageous human journey , that of passing into the Kingdom of Heaven ! " " The free gift of God , " said Lazarus . I finished for Grandfather my summary of what Father Saint Stephen had said . Then I added what Lazarus  --  standing alertly behind Israel  --  had said , in an even , unsurprised voice . I asked Lazarus what he meant . Grandfather answered for him . " For sin pays a wage , " said Grandfather , quoting the Fiddle Bible , Paul 's sermon to the Romans , " and the wages of sin is death , but Lord God gives freely , and his gift is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus Our Lord . " " God bless you , " said Father Saint Stephen to me , touching my hand , " and may Our Lord 's love come to you swiftly . "  | " Get away ! " said Grandfather at my side , blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you see , Grim , both of them ? " said Israel , moving in front of me , shaking his head , relaxed now , certain . " This is a death ship , " I said . " They mean for it to be . " " We suffer the ravages of hellfire , " said Father Saint Stephen , " because we must stay behind while the little souls go on to glory . " " Grandfather , do you want me to believe him ? " I spoke in Swedish , not wanting Father Saint Stephen to understand how shaken I was . " I can not , not for anything . I think Israel is right . He 's crazy . " " Not that , Grim , think for yourself , " said Grandfather . " We should stop them ! It is n't right to give up ! We can fight whatever they are afraid of  --  the British or the Americans , or anyone ! Did n't Jesus fight ? He should have ! It is crazy to quit ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandfather spoke to Father Saint Stephen in German , " My grandson wants to stop you . " At that , they both started to laugh . The other missionaries joined in . How crazy their laughter seemed . I felt humiliated . I felt angry . Israel gave me what sympathy he could manage , a quick nod of agreement . It was small comfort . Grandfather saw my upset , and turned , " They are not mad , Grim . Disagree with them , but do not dismiss them . As Lord God is my teacher and judge , they are wrong , not mad , wrong ! You must learn the difference and the lesson . Them and their works . It all makes them err again . They worship their works , Grim . And when they can not purchase their way into Heaven , they blame Lord God , and weaken , and break . Yes , Grim , fight ! But you must see that your enemy is Satan . This priest is not the enemy . He is wrong ! " Father Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can suppose now that what entertained those two was their opportunity to argue the Reformation once again : works , faith , justification , sacraments , Martin Luther , and tireless rhetoric . How revealing of them , and their confessions of faith , that they stood eager to dispute abstractions as if in an ecclesiastical court while hundreds agonized in the hold . They did agree on preening talk .  | They did not agree on correct course of action , the Catholic priest to help others first in order to help himself , the Lutheran pastor to help himself first in order to help others . It was action that settled the confrontation . Father Saint Stephen overreached himself and ushered his end . He might have genuinely believed that Satan ruled the earth  --  as worn as those men must have been in trying to minister to the so-called fleet of the damned , they might have hallucinated anything . But Father Saint Stephen had chosen to overlook that those were human beings not theological ideas whom he watched die in the ship 's hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And an able brother of those people was present to rise up to destroy Father Saint Stephen 's clever talk with certain violence : I mean Lazarus Furore , a fair representative of those late-twentieth-century critics who had reached to establish a kingdom in the wilderness without need of God-talk or God . Lazarus flung himself ? exactly like a bird of prey  --  across the room and against Father Saint Stephen . The two crashed through the table and rolled back against the bulkhead . I did not see Lazarus 's knife . Israel screamed , " Not that way ! " Lazarus just screamed , unintelligibly , and then ripped . It was a crime of precision . Is the how worth recording ? There is a soft spot at the base of the throat . Lazarus found it . He recoiled from the corpse as suddenly as he had attacked . He staggered backward , met no one 's eyes , wiped his blade on his clothes , found the cabin door by reaching behind him , and was gone . I crouched defensively , Israel backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord God forgive them . " The missionaries reacted sluggishly . Father Hospital looked at me with what could have been either condemnation or compassion . The others lifted the corpse onto the table . They began a prayer in many tongues , at least some of them speaking Latin . I observe now that the effect was babble . Within moments , they conducted themselves as if we were not present . Grandfather would not permit me to speak . He ordered Israel to get me out . Israel obeyed instantly . We got topside in a rush . Guy met us , demanding information , saying that Lazarus was huddled bloody and delirious in Black Crane . Israel outlined the murder . We three sagged on the quarterdeck , then fell into  | the work crew loading Black Crane . I made several trips into the hold for crates , and I admit that I have no memory of what I saw . I refused to see what was down there . It was an hour , or hours ? time fails in that sort of shock  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Otter Ransom and Orlando the Black , declaring , " I shall have that mast down straightaway . " The End of the Earth fter that defeat , Grandfather gained effective control of his passengers as well as absolute command of his Angel of Death . He again bargained with me : he would get my family to Mexico if I would come away with him afterward . I did not agree , I did not refuse , a passive pledge of obedience that I understood as a final act of disloyalty to Israel . I would not speak against Grandfather in our councils that , to our discredit , became an opportunity for dreary exchanges between the factions on board united only in their fear of Grandfather : Earle baiting Thord ; Israel shouting down Guy ; Peregrine and Charity obtusely silent . Lazarus regained his composure but distanced himself from all including Cleopatra ; he became dogmatic , saying the " revolution " had come and we were caught in a worldwide struggle . It may not have been Grandfather 's intention , yet he came to rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , by division , subjugation , dismissal . Grandfather declared our course was southwest for the Strait of Magellan . He said he would not go back through " the flames of perdition " at the equator , nor would he risk " the legions of Satan " in the Caribbean . It was not bad strategy , even if it was based upon grandiose metaphor . I stood with Grandfather ; the " Turks stood with me ; the Furores with no one ; my family dissolved in doubts . Grandfather 's will prevailed . We ran the horse  | latitudes , rode the Brazil Current for weeks ; our progress was cautious and erratic , standing well seaward of the coastline and , after we were fired upon by a convoy of freighters , of the sea-lanes as well . We suffered squalls , ghastly heat , innumerable sightings of wreckage and corpses on rafts ; we witnessed at least one large sea battle off Rio de Janeiro , gun flashes and deep thunder two nights running ; we were chased soon after by two small vessels booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated about derelicts or ships in distress . We monitored the radio waves to find more of the same silence we had experienced off Europe . We did see a plume of fire off the mouth of the River Plate ; perhaps there are records of catastrophe at Montevideo . We assumed there was only disaster on that coastline . Grandfather reconsidered his intention not to stop again . He weighed a new notion to make a landfall somewhere on the Falkland Islands , a rugged archipelago several days ' hard sail east of Tierra del Fuego and the Strait of Magellan . He worried about the jerry-rigged foremast and the damage to the bow . Worse , a blow off Cape Tres Puntas sent us careening into the South Atlantic , and beating back west ripped our best sails . I encouraged Grandfather 's reassessment because of my worry for our health : we were all heartsick ; at least one of us , Gizur , was mind-sick ( I was not unaware of Lazarus 's black mood , just insensitive ) ; and we had infections , malnutrition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I conferred over the charts and made a decision . Grandfather did not inform Israel , Guy , or Thord of our new course . I was too ashamed of my collusion with Grandfather to do more than mention that we were bound for a stopoff before making for the Pacific . Grandfather gave his sailing orders . He was obeyed . We wore around one of the two large islands , East Falkland , keeping well clear in a freakish late summer storm of very dirty rain and heavy seas . By nightfall , we drew opposite where I put the capital of the archipelago , Port Stanley . We stood in close enough for Wild Drumrul to report large concentrations of campfires on the hillsides . At daybreak , a baffling fog closed on us and we put to sea again , hearing very distant booms to the south that we hoped were thunderclaps . At twilight , the fog lifted enough for us to observe several cutters well to port , making for Port  | Stanley . We came about to the south , back into fogbanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Falkland at moonrising , and decided to risk one of the out islands . I chose Mead 's Kiss , on my chart several miles off the southern cliffs . I was anxious by then , because my charts were too general ; I had become acutely aware that one of the chief things we needed for Tierra del Fuego was better sailing information . We circled the lee shore of Mead 's Kiss , fighting contrary winds and another squall . There were campfires at several places on the north shore , so I chose what seemed a deep cove on the southern shore , and at dawn , with an opening in the fog , I took the jolly and a party to reconnoiter . I found a dilapidated weather station and a stone-built sealer 's shack . At my signal , Grandfather brought Angel of Death into the cove . That morning , we ate our first meal on land in more than three months . The first days we gave to reconnaissance , security , and rest . Mead 's Kiss was a four-mile-long triangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs . It seemed pastoral to us , more forgotten than desolate , a sense confused by the many sheep skeletons we found and by an unusual layer of black soot gathered in drifts in the rock crevasses . The campfires on the north shore of Mead 's Kiss were those of two large refugee parties . We avoided contact . When some of their number spied on us , we brandished our guns and showed our dogs and they scampered back to their part of the island . It is sad to suppose that they were more frightened of us than of their plight . Their ships were finished . After establishing our defense , we worked at rehabilitating ourselves and Angel of Death . We fixed the sealer 's shack against the incessant wind and filthy rains . We fashioned a makeshift dry dock to get to the bow damage , removed the broken foremast to retop it by lashing on the mizzenmast pilfered from The Free Gift of God . At Gizur 's direction , we mended our sails ; at Grandfather 's command , we reconditioned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must leave before the storms that would begin in March . Within two weeks , we were set , except for two essentials : We were very short of fresh food ; we had no information of ' conditions in the Strait . At a council , a reconnaissance to East Falkland was proposed , debated , voted upon in the  | affirmative . I was to lead the party . Grandfather dissented implacably . Grandfather had been unseated in his authority over us the moment we touched land , and knew it , and yet would not acknowledge it . He would not directly denounce Israel and Guy . He talked through me . He said that our fortnight on Mead 's Kiss was " Lord God 's grace , " and that we were fools to divide ourselves . He added , " They opposed me landing here . They oppose me when I want to leave . They are sheep ! Like those bones there , they will not gather to their shepherd . I say damn them , damn all men who have eyes and ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand Lord God 's judgment on the sins of unbelievers ! " Israel and Guy scoffed at Grandfather 's advice ; indeed , they seemed reinforced in their opinion by his prejudice against them . I was more upset by the quarrel than either side was . They were comfortable in their contempt for each other . I recall that , soon after the council , I challenged Cleopatra with Grandfather 's declaration that we should not separate . I repeated it exactly . And why ? I think that I wanted to engage her in order to test myself against her mind . I simply wanted to get her attention . And she shocked me . She was not unmoved by Grandfather 's warning . She spoke seriously of him and what she called " the Norse reach . " I felt proud . She had inadvertently used my way of thinking of myself . It was as if she admired my seamanship , more , for she seemed to evidence appreciation of my birthright . Cleopatra did not actually intend her remarks that way .

" This speech is probably a conflation of many remarks Cleopatra made to me during the voyage ; nonetheless , if it is , it touches the themes she reiterated that night . I could not answer her . I felt humiliated . How cruel she was . A man speaks better of his dogs than that . It still hurts to recall her compassionless appraisal of me as if I were a specimen in a cage . It would please me if I could now declare that she was wrong . She was not right . At the time , Cleopatra 's reference to Peregrine 's so-called fear of me made me most ashamed  --  of what kind of son I was and had been on board Angel of Death . It was that remorse , for faults I see now were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boyish adoration of Cleopatra 's intelligence , that turned me once again . I wanted to show Cleopatra that I could act with reason and utility . ( New Benthamism was on my mind , although not as now , for I was not bold enough then to challenge Cleopatra on her mother 's prodigies and how ruinous they seemed for the outcasts number . ) I wanted to show Cleopatra that I could think abstractly , could imagine , could choose . I was a fool , as I tangled myself up again racing between  | Grandfather and Israel . Having been finally disloyal to Israel after The Free Gift of God , I was willing to be disloyal to Grandfather too . I should have minded Grandfather . He told me what I myself believed . We were lucky on Mead 's Kiss . We should not have asked more . I confounded myself . There were good reasons , utilitarian reasons , to follow the council 's vote for a reconnaissance to the Falklands . Molly needed vegetables . I needed charts . There was a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would welcome us not as refugees but as a ship in distress . I know now that all the reason in all the books can not change fate , or provide a flicker of the wisdom one gains if one heeds a prophetic voice like Grandfather 's . I understand now that those two weeks of Norse luck on Mead 's Kiss had lulled us , so that the inexplicable outrages of our Atlantic crossing no longer weighed on us . It was profoundly wrong of us not to concentrate on what we had learned out there , on what was right in front of us , that dirty rain and those ash deposits and those deep , resonant boomings from the south . It is my experience now , as it was not then , that tragedy  --  I mean drama of catastrophe on a global canvas , like the Greeks ' Troy , the Romans ' Rome , the Lutherans ' Saxony  --  is like a living thing , with genesis , personality , talents , especially with times when the despair seems to have done . This apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by turning from themes established and explicated . When under attack , one is always in peril , even during the lulls . I shall be specific . It was possible to reconsider our voyage from Stockholm harbor in such a way that our escape from the King 's Spies , the German " wolf , " the British , French , Spanish , and Portuguese cutters , the massacre at Port Praia , the tempest , the burning sea , Father Saint Stephen , were not simply defeats , were also victories  --  that we were fortunate , blessed , very , very lucky to have made Mead 's Kiss . However , this did not mean that the tragedy was complete . We were still in jeopardy . We were still lost , outside , exiled . It was stupidity to let down our guard . Indeed , if Israel and Guy and Thord and the Furores had one common fault , it was not that they could not believe in goodness , it was that they could not believe in irredeemable and nonrational badness . Cleopatra was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is darkness . For all his shameless excesses , Grandfather  | could look at those villains and into that darkness and endure , more , he could keep fighting for his own . The others looked at darkness and begged parole , pleaded for a peace that did not exist . I pushed off in Black Crane at twilight . I took with me the Turks , Otter Ransom , Lazarus and Orlando the Black , and Iceberg , who had weathered the tropical crossing better than Goldberg and the two pups . Grandfather 's final warning to me was clear : he took me behind the sealer 's shack , stood me up against a huge boulder protruding from the hillside , and lectured me with an intensity that was a blend of his dread , wisdom , resolve , might , and love . He told me that if there was trouble and I could not get back to Mead 's Kiss , or if he was forced to retreat from Mead 's Kiss , I was to sail Black Crane due south on the sixtieth meridian , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as Lord God is my witness and judge , I swear . " If only I could report equally meaningful exchanges between me and Peregrine , Israel , Guy , Earle , Thord , Orri , Gizur , Molly , even Charity . My farewell was subdued . I was too superstitious to say good-bye . How profoundly I regret that now . East and West Falkland are like two crabs , back to back , divided by a one-hundred-mile-long and ten-mile-wide funnel of water , bordered by out islands like droppings , especially west of West Falkland . The archipelago lies about four hundred miles off Tierra del Fuego , on a part of the ocean floor that is called the Falkland Plateau . What I knew about the Falklands that day was concise ; wind , rain , birds , seals , and a dampness that frosted one 's beard . I approached cautiously , intending to swing around East Falkland in three days , my original plan was to circle east through the Falkland Sound and come around to approach Port Stanley , at the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We crossed what was called the Eagle Passage between George Island and East Falkland without incident but with difficulty , the seas sloppy , the fogbanks and steady wind dangerous in lumbering Black Crane . The out islands showed concentrations of fires , and wreckage that was likely other derelict vessels piled up on rocks . East Falkland showed encampments inland . Lazarus made  | sense when he said there seemed more fires than there were supposed to be people in the Falklands . And where were the flocks , I asked , the islands were supposed to be covered with sheep ranches . I bypassed the first villages we sighted on East Falkland as we moved into the Sound , more for uncertainty of tides than for worry . By midnight , we felt more of those very deep rumblings from the southwest . Wild Drumrul used a Turkish word that I was to learn meant earthquake . When Wild Drumrul spotted several long boats filled with men and rowers making for us from East Falkland , we must have been twenty-five miles inside the Sound . My crew reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvering the mid-Sound islets and rocks , because the water was choppy , the tide dragging us westward . I struggled to keep our bow up to the threat . The longboats passed us as if we were not there . I counted four craft , heavily laden so low in the water , pulling in haste toward West Falkland to the northwest . I liked their look . What a peculiar explanation for a choice that would mean everything to my fate . It is so ; I liked the look of purpose about them : determined , sure , hard-set , well done . I brought Black Crane about and fell into their wake . We could not keep up with the wind against us , so I struck sail , put us under oar . Soon after , we heard explosions to the far east ; Otter Ransom agreed with Orlando the Black that it was an artillery barrage . We pulled across the Sound 's centrifugal tidal rip , returned to sail . By first light , we had lost the longboats , but we had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramshackle village at its northern end , sprawled between cliffs and rolling moors . We passed outlying jetties , saw holes that resembled impact craters . It was early morning as we came about to clear the sandbars , took in sail , pulled into the inlet . We passed two old men working on sails on the stony beach . At the inmost wharf , there was a sandbag redoubt , and a flagpole bearing a blue and white pennant showing a yellow sunface . None of us recognized that it was the flag of the Argentine Republic . What we saw seemed quiet , not dangerous  --  deep poverty . My explanation for the fact that we were ignored is that several other boats came into the inlet after us , and more were already tied up . There was a festive mood . When church bells began tolling from the town , I made my deci- sion to land . We tied up , and Lazarus , Otter Ransom , and I set off for the village . We fell into a rush of men and boys from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the village square  --  muddy holes , plenty of dogs , several rusted vehicles , a church , and a row of stone huts . The bells stopped as a tattered platoon of soldiers in green woolen uniforms emerged from the church doors . I quickly made sense of the scene . There was to be an execution by firing squad . Though we were strangers , there were many there not of the village , and we were overlooked in the excitement . We slid toward the church side of the square , near several ancient-looking nuns  --  whom I thought out of place , given that the church was Protestant , by the cornerstone , the First Presbyterian Church of West Falkland . There was also a scaffolding there . I tell this about that scaffolding : There were wagon wheels raised above its platform ; there were decaying corpses tied on top of those wheels . The crowd became lively , expectant , when the soldiers led out a dozen prisoners chained together in threes . Lazarus translated the commanding officer 's speech to the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberated village of 2 de Diciembre . " His talk included sufficient references to invasion , sedition , sabotage , and counterrevolution for us to conclude that the Falkland archipelago  --  two hundred treeless , windscourged islands of shepherds and fishermen  --  was buried in a civil war . Lazarus said the soldiers were Argentines , though the officer also used the word Patagonians , meaning they were from that region of Argentina . They belonged to what was called " El Ejercito de la Tierra del Fuego , " which means , literally , the army of the land afire , or , figuratively , The Army of the End of the Earth . " I 've seen This before , read about it all my life , " said Lazarus . " It 's too familiar . It 's routine . This town is the front , or was recently . A good guess is that it fell to these troops last December , in a late spring campaign . These campesinos are the militia . Our commandant is regular army , a drunkard , to hear him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war this is , and who the enemy is , well , I can make a good guess . " Lazarus was interrupted as the executions did proceed with a routine . The first trio , a Negro and two gray little men , died badly . The subaltern 's pistol misfired at the coup de grace . The commandant was furious with the ineptitude of his men . His temper  | seemed to amuse the crowd . And once the corpses were cleared , the gathering relaxed noticeably . Women and children appeared from the stone huts . Altogether , the villagers appeared as condemned as the prisoners  --  beaten down , starving , hanging on . The idea of politics in such a place was ridiculous , what Grandfather would have said was a Satanic jest . The highest form of civilization in 2 de Diciembre was the firing squad . The second trio of prisoners was dragged to the posts . The women behind us let out a wail . I realized then they were not nuns , just hags in black . One stout hag churned across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the condemned , a thin , boyish white man with a mangled arm . The subaltern tried to pull her away . The boy sagged to her , held up only by his bonds . The display seemed to embarrass the commandant . From the graveyard gate , a stocky black-bearded man appeared . He wore a broad-brimmed hat and a clerical collar as would a minister calling on his parishioners ; oddly , he also wore excellent brown seaboots . Black-beard made for the hag . He carried a shovel , and it occurred to me that he was both pastor and gravedigger . He moved with a weight and dexterity that attracted me ? more animated than the whole assembly . He got the hag up , took her back to the scaffold steps , consoled her like a worried son . It was bizarre yet sad-making . I suppose that explains why the commandant was not alarmed . The subaltern ordered his men to get on with it . Black-beard shouted at the subaltern in Spanish , then walked toward the commandant , turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ye 've done , there 's no forgiving ! She raised that boy after his folk was killed by yerr butchers ! Ye tortured out his mind ! I want ye to know , it 's important to myself ye know , I do n't see an end to this ! Do n't want an end ! Yerr Republic be a thief ! What 's ours be ours by right ! " The soliloquy was a ruse , as Black-beard was a masquerade , neither pastor nor gravedigger . He was the enemy . His talk distracted the mob , astounded the soldiers , signaled the attack . Blackbeard arched back and swung his shovel , felling the commandant . The square was suddenly awash in ricocheting bullets . Explosions tore apart the church tower and the second stories of the only two real buildings in town . The scaffolding took a direct mortar hit and toppled in pieces . We three broke for the inlet , were cut off  | by firepower and the hysterical crowd . Otter Ransom dragged me and Lazarus behind the trough of a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiasco . The condemned died with their captors . The subaltern waved at the warehouse down the cliffside , the origin of the heaviest fire , and gathered what men he could for a charge that did not lack courage . Two small groups of men firing pistols and rifles then rushed the square from the north side to outflank the militia . The combat was hand-to-hand , fanatical . We had to scramble again , Iceberg right with us , through the shattered church , through falling timbers , over the iron gate , and into the graveyard . We worked from stone to tomb back to a stone-built shed . We were moving away from Black Crane . Behind the shed was a sloping heath , beyond that , hillocks and treeless moors . As we rested , Lazarus said he hoped Orlando the Black had pushed off . I said that would make us dead men . He returned that I was a coward , this was " the revolution . " I can see now that he was as frightened as I was , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed him , we cursed each other , over the gunfire and explosions . We did not do more than yell at each other , however , too terrified to swing . It was childish hysterics . I understand now that I despised Lazarus not , as I then thought , because he was a braggart and poseur , or because I did not understand why he had murdered that pathetic priest ; I hated him because he was my rival for Cleopatra . I knew he thought me a dumb beast ; I thought him a sly cheat . More , I had reason  --  incidents on board Angel of Death I have passed by  --  to believe that he and Cleopatra were lovers . This seems as inappropriate a revelation here as it was an inappropriate interlude then . We were trapped by massacre . Yet I had deceived myself for months about the two of them . She had shown her condescension toward me the night before . I blamed Lazarus . I was a young man . I had naive fancies . I do even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until here to mention my longing and jealousy because I have yet to accept completely our baleful , never resolved triangle . Lazarus and I were interrupted in our squabbling by the appearance in my life for the second time of the very same bold , graceful , sad-eyed seaman who had earlier heralded the battle with a shovel . " There should he some more telling way I can introduce  | Germanicus . It does not come to me . Germanicus Frazer himself , stockily built , black-bearded , proud-hearted , girded with iron determinism as Grandfather was with his ineffable Lord God , then pushed through the graveyard 's postern gate . He had the boy with the mangled arm across his shoulders , and the stout hag in tow . He saw us before we did him , crouched , gritted , waved a black horse pistol to keep us at bay while he weighed his chances . He began heavily , " I 'm Frazer , of the South Georgia Volunteers . I need yerr help . Give it , or I take it . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye " ? he pointed at me ? " to carry her . We got to get up there . " " It 's not our fight , " said Otter Ransom to me in Swedish . " We have people back there , " I said to Germanicus . " Dead or gone now . With me or divil take ye , " he said , shifting the boy on his shoulders . That was not a choice . I got the woman up , and we ran for it . We climbed , dodged , up above the town , back across to the cliffs . Germanicus was stalwart , not suspicious , though I doubt we could have overpowered him . He had the aura of the indomitable ; if one has met such , one knows the effect is absolute . We rested at a vantage that showed the inlet . Black Crane was gone . Through the mist , we spotted a patrol in pursuit , shooting at us from great range . We got up to the peak of the cliffs , plunged to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder-strewn shore . There were four long boats in the shallows , the same ones I had chanced to follow the night before . I cursed my luck . All happened quickly . We three were deliriously winded by our escape , clinging to each other , lost . Germanicus was alert and tireless , ordering the men in the boats to action . We handed over the boy and the hag to a boat already filled with wounded . Their attack had failed so badly that there were only enough left to man three of the craft . Germanicus was second-in-command ; his captain was seriously wounded . The company , grizzly , sheepskin-wrapped , heavily armed , was , I would later learn , a guerrilla group from the South Atlantic island of South Georgia , calling themselves the South Georgia Volunteers . Germanicus went over to his captain , then returned to us . " Be ye beasties ? " he asked . I did not understand . ( Beasties was their word for refugees without refuge , for the washed-up remnant of the so-called fleet of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the inlet and also way to the south , that we had to return for them . He said , " I understand ye , I do . And thank ye for yerr help . Know this , yerr folk 're done . I need ye more , short four oars in my boat . Frazer tells God 's truth . The Patties have gunboats down the Sound , coming up , sartain . " " We came up the Sound last night , " I protested , " from Mead 's Kiss . " " It 's done ! " he said , gesturing dismissively . I was a head over him , still he was my match . His anger was not directed , was more for his wasted men than our defeat . He looked to the three of us , said , " Ye 're drafted into the Volunteers . We shoot deserters . Get in the boat , lads . " " We must go back , " I said . Lazarus and Otter Ransom gathered beside me . Germanicus softened . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ye can too . I do n't want ye shot . Are ye good Christians ? " I did not reply . " Thank God ye got here . Help them that need it , " he said . It was a fine , godly point . It carried us into Germanicus 's boat . We pushed out into the Sound , pulled hard northward against the wind to clear the tidal rip , making for the cover of the mist . There were many wounded in our boat . One throat-shot-man kept pulling wildly at my feet . More than once , Germanicus 's sergeant , a meaty , rough man named Motherwell , asked to lighten the boat by passing over the dead . Germanicus did not answer until , at one point when we came under nuisance artillery fire from the West Falkland shore , he scolded Motherwell , " Everyone goes back with me ! " The third boat , with the stricken captain , was too undermanned to keep pace with us . Germanicus had us slow down , but the captain signaled we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther back , until it was lost in the mist . Word was passed by signal from the eastern shore that there was a gunboat coming down the Sound to intercept us . Germanicus directed us closer to the East Falkland shore , berating us , " Pull , lads , we no quit ! " We rowed , vomited , rowed , bled and wept and rowed . My hands were shredded ; the cramps in my back and legs were so painful that I could relieve them only by pulling harder . By late afternoon we left the Sound for an East Falkland inlet with two forks , one back south , the other toward the mountains . How we got to shore I do  | not know . We were met by more guerrillas at a burned-out wharf before a row of shattered stone huts . They helped us up the hillside to a muddy plateau with a sandbag-built redoubt commanding a view of the Sound . There was also a tarpaulin-covered field hospital , where we collapsed . I awoke with cramps in my legs and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did I noticed a tall , bent , sticklike man walking among we survivors of 2 de Diciembre . He was almost deformed with his twisted posture . He offered us small bits of fruit and some whiskey from a cup , then told us with a beautiful , tired voice more compelling than the wind that he was the chaplain ? Longfaeroe , he said . He then began to sing above the groans and death rattles , " Hear our cry , Jehovah . From the end of the earth I call thee with fainting heart . Lift me up and set me upon a rock . For thou be my shelter , a tower of refuge from the enemy . In thy tent will I make my home for ever , and find my shelter under the cover of thy wings . For thou , Jehovah , hast heard my vows and granted the hope of all who revere thy name . To the true king 's life add length of days , keep him , keep him ! " He broke off with a gasp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what " king " he meant . I hurt too much to think hard . He did lighten my heart . Lazarus rolled over beside me , mumbled , " The end of the earth , did you hear him ? They 're rugged , whatever they are . " Otter Ransom listened to my translation of the psalm , smiled for it . Iceberg lapped my face and , in her nursemaid way , comforted the three of us . I must have slept . It was dark when Germanicus woke me . " Ye 're free of us now . We 're back for my captain . I 'll not have him on their wheels , the divils . I 'm grieved for yer folk . If they make Stanley , it be ours still . Keep to the high road there , east , eighty miles . The hills be bad with the beasties . My advice to ye be to go with the column the morrow . " " Can you give us a boat , or take us with you , when we 're rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's finished here . " " We can walk back , " I tried . " So ye say . Frazer tells , what 's south of here on both sides of the Sound be Patties . Yerr chance be east , or none . If there 's trouble for ye , tell them Volunteers ye served Germanicus Frazer , El- ephant Frazer 's son . He owes ye debt for yerr backs and faith . " He offered his hand ; we touched as we could , raw flesh on raw flesh . " This is Lazarus Furore , and Otter Ransom , from America and Sweden , " I said . " And Iceberg . I 'm Grim Fiddle , Peregrine Ide 's son . " " Luck then , Grim Fiddle , " he said , and was gone . It is crucial to note that Germanicus 's captain , whom he never found , was his older brother , the legendary and beloved Samson Frazer , whom the chaplain , Longfaeroe , referred to when he sang , " Keep him , keep him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make our own way , we were drafted as bearers into the hospital column leaving the next morning for Port Stanley . We learned something of the fighting from the guerrillas as we waited to move out . The South Georgia Volunteers , and what was left of the Falkland Irregulars , were in full retreat from a massacre at Goose Green on East Falkland 's Choiseul Sound the day before Germanicus 's raid on 2 de Diciembre ( whose Falklander name was Port Howard ) . None of this should appear grandly military . At most a thousand men and boys were involved on Germanicus 's side  --  fishermen , shepherds , sealers , whale-poachers . As the guerrillas wanted us to understand , these were the vocations of Jesus ' disciples . I suspect this detail had been forced on them by their preachers , like Longfaeroe , to fuel their fight . It was not a holy war , however , even if the guerrillas saw it that way . It was primarily a blood feud between those who spoke Spanish and those who spoke English , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bellowed , " What 's ours be ours by right ! " Once he had some facts to add to his intuition and knowledge of South American history , Lazarus insisted this was less a civil war than the remains of an imperial conflict . In the nineteenth century , Great Britain had used its fleet to acquire the Falkland archipelago , making it the chief component of what was then a sealer 's and whaler 's promised land , called the British Falkland Islands Dependencies  --  which included the Falklands , South Georgia , the South Sandwich , South Orkney , and South Shetland islands , the Palmer archipelago , and Graham Land , also known as the 1'altner Peninsula of ' Antarctica . The British claim was ever in  | dispute by the Argentine Republic , who laid cross claim to the whole of the Falkland Dependencies , and to the Falklands in specific , calling them the Islas Malvinas . I am describing this too carefully for the information I can be sure of , but it does evidence Lazarus 's ideological mind , and does pertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falklanders , who were mostly British descendants , hated the few South Americans settled among them ? a racial and religious bigotry . By the late twentieth century , revolutions and reactions on the mainland had upset the shaky political equilibrium in the Falkland Dependencies . The Argentine Republic was certainly the main sponsor of the invading Army of the End of the Earth , who were mostly from Argentina 's Patagonian steppes , those whom Germanicus called " Patties . " I have a faint heart for this . It seems as over-simple and miserable recording it now as it was living it then . In every land , for every people , the oldest wounds opened as easily as the fresh ones . Who first transgressed in the Falklands , and why , and where , is lost to me in the cycle of lies , what Israel taught me was the politics of falsehood . I know Germanicus told me the Patties struck first . I imagine a Pattie would say opposite . What matter now ? Patriotism , separatism , imperialism , colonialism , adventurism  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , equator under tempest , south under ice . As Grandfather told me , there was no refuge , there was no sanctury , there was no peace . As I had seen , there was only flight and exile and abandonment and endurance until one could take no more , then standing or dying  --  perhaps first giving what one got . There is profoundly more to the politics and ruination of the end of the earth , but that must await further events in this chronicle without whose explanation I realize now , acutely and fully , what happened to me and mine would remain incredible , unacceptable , seemingly less history than fantasy  --  so dark , I worry that even the light this writing means to me might not be able to show the truth . I reach too far ahead . There was specific jeopardy for us in that hospital column in retreat across the high moors of East Falkland . The Army of the End of the Earth  --  I shall henceforth call them as did the South Georgians : Patagonians or Patties  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of regulars on West Falkland , was said to be rushing to obliterate the socalled loyalist resistance ( Falkland Irregulars , South Georgia Volunteers ) before the fall winds hampered the supply lines from the continent . The loyalists had no hope against gunboats supporting artillery . Worse , the desperate refugees cast up on the Falklands , as Angel of Death had been , whom they called beasties , were wandering the islands , killing and being killed . The Patties used the beasties as forced labor , sometimes as paramilitary labor , since many of them were originally from the Americas . The loyalists had three sorts of adversaries then , closing a claw-hand on them : Spanish-speaking Falklanders native there ; the Army of the End of the Earth from Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego ; and the beasties from everywhere . And how I recoiled then at the notion of calling those poor people beasties , even wince now as I write beasties ; that was what they called them , what I came to calling them , and I should not hide the shame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's No Man 's Land was commanded by a captain in the Irregulars , a nephew of the Falklander commander , Brackenbury . He was a butcher who encouraged his men to shoot at will at the beasties who showed themselves to our line of march . I thought this hideous , and also stupid . There were less than a dozen sound men in the column  --  the bulk wounded , with women and children tending a flock of sheep we drove before us . The treeless moors made our group helplessly naked . We marched and shot all day , up the muddy sheep runs and into the foothills of the gray-green and snowcapped central mountain range . Our line of sight was impeded only by folds in the land and a patchy ground mist . I asked one trooper if our tactics  --  sniping at the beasties  --  did not invite trouble from them , whom we could see camped in large numbers way down below us along the north shore of the island . Because of this conversation , later that day the butcher challenged my loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our weapons . After that , we were used as cart beasts , all pain , up and down the rolling tracks , leaving the foothills to make for the big mountains to the east . On the second day , we crossed a rocky waste pitted with hogs and piles of sheep skeletons . The smell of battle  | drifted over us from the south , and we swung away from a pass and made for a path north of the range . With nightfall , we could see hundreds of campfires below us , above us , all about us . We three were assigned burial duty . When we finished , we were banished to the off-loaded hospital carts and given small rations . We pulled blood-soaked sheepskins over us to keep out the howling winds . The beasties attacked before first light . Iceberg woke me with her paw . The wind at first covered the shots and screams . The battle centered on the food carts that had been set in the middle of the main camp , fifty yards off from us . They came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , filthy and slowfooted , a few weapons , mostly clubs and fists . The melee was savage , awful noises  --  growls , snarls , whines . We three rolled under an empty cart with Iceberg . We watched the butcher command his men to form a circle around the tarpaulin , where the wounded were laid out . We watched a tide of flesh crash over a wall of flesh . It was cold-making , the wind and the dying , those beastlike noises . Longfaeroe appeared out of the dark . He carried a torch , led several children and women by the hand . He must have seen Iceberg 's eyes flash in reflection of the torch , because he beckoned us to him . He had the women pile crates together , which he smashed with his foot , lit for a fire . This , with all the rest continuing . We stayed under the cart . There was nothing between us and the massacre but heath , wind , and Longfaeroe . He organized the people near the fire , perhaps ten yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He filled his lungs and sang out clearly , and as he did , first I , then Otter Ransom and Lazarus , crawled over to listen to his prayer : " Rescue me from my enemies , 0 Jehovah ! Be my tower of strength against all who assail me ! Rescue me from evildoers ! Deliver me from men of blood ! Savage men lie in wait for me ! They lie in ambush to attack me , for no fault or guilt of mine ! 0 Jehovah , innocent as these be , they take post against us . . . . " They did pass over us ; at least , they let us be . We huddled there , praying with Longfaeroe as the sky lightened to the east . We fed the fire and wept . It was shock , and eventually we did respond to the cries of the wounded . I have no explanation why we were not murdered . I think of ' Longfaeroe 's psalm , 59 in the  | Fiddle Bible , which concludes with celebration " when morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong tower . " I assumed then that Longfaeroe saw himself as a strong tower too . He sat there , stern , wind-whipped , and faced down that murder . I put weight on him for it . Thinking of that psalm , I ask myself what protected me . It was certainly not true that I was without fault , or guilt , for I had likely killed that stranger in Vexbeggar . Perhaps the lesson I took most completely from that heath at the time was that it was vain of me to try to tally innocence and guilt , good and bad , pleasure and pain in a formula that can explain why some men die horribly , ripped and smashed , and others walk through slaughter unscarred . I saw that there is a divine justice that has judgments beyond my intellect . The Norse in me then , as it does now , offered luck for proof . Though that can seem inadequate , it is all I know to say of the mystery of how I survived that hospital column . Longfaeroe took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The women led the children . It was not right to leave the dead uncovered . We had to flee , down into the ravine and up with the sun toward another mountain . There is one more aspect of that episode that I must record , for it signified for me a beginning of my understanding of Lazarus , and of myself . It was night again before Lazarus , Otter Ransom , and I could talk intelligibly . We made the fire , tended the worst of the wounded , stood our watch listening to Longfaeroe sing psalms to put the children to sleep . Lazarus said , " I did n't know it would be like that . I ca n't make it out . That madman , Saint Stephen , I 'm sure he 's the enemy . Them and their cant , empty words in cathedrals built with blood , doing God 's work , ' collecting money , while the colonels and the death merchants rob children of any chance  --  I thought getting them was right . That 's what that madman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were tortured ! Luanda ! Do you know what they 've done in Luanda ? I do n't know . What were those things last night ? Were those people ? How could it have gotten this bad ? They really were beasts . " ' They were men , like us , " I said . Otter Ransom asked me to explain what Lazarus was saying . I did so , watching Lazarus stir  | the fire , his eyes glazed , as if the massacre was still there to see . " They were not men , you are wrong , Grim Fiddle , " said Otter Ransom to me . " I have seen killing , more than either of you . My mother 's people disappeared in 1941 . They never were like that . " Recalling Lamba Time-Thief 's portent , I sat forward , said to the fire , " They were half-men , were n't they ? " I forbade the thought with a smile that was not humor . I banished the portent , hoping the while my resistance to prophecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley was a smoldering fortress . The town was heaped together on the south shore of a ten-mile-long inlet that was shaped like open scissor blades between cliffs that led up to the second highest peak on East Falkland . The remains of the naval station were scattered at the southeastern tip of the inlet ; the port was marked for miles by pillars of black smoke . Pattie gunboats were running in every night to lob incendiary shells , running out again before the shore batteries on the cliff shelves north and south of the inlet could locate and reply . West and north of the loyalist wire were camps of beasties , too desperate for food for the loyalists to keep away with threats . Ours was not the only hospital column that arrived that afternoon , three days after I was supposed to have returned to Angel of Death with food , news , hope . Longfaeroe herded us together as we waited to be passed through the first wire into the wet fields outside the loyalist redoubts , where there was a field hospital . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered our wounded , fell into a mess line for hot gruel with whale fat . We made our beds at the edge of the field kitchen and a corral of sheep , slept in the afternoon sun . When I awoke , it was twilight and Longfaeroe was gone . We three conferred , agreed we should try to get into the loyalist fortifications to hunt for Black Crane , perhaps grab a boat and escape . There was no optimism in our conspiracy . The sentries passed me and Otter Ransom readily , barred Lazarus because of his copper skin . I jumped at this ; a sentry clubbed me back , cocked his rifle at Otter Ransom . Lazarus screamed , " Murdering bastards no better than the Argentines ! "  | They forced us to our knees , called an officer . He took a look , said , " Do your duty . " One must understand how exhausted we were ; it explains our carelessness , and our change of luck . I used Germanicus 's name , I invoked his name , yelling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Samson , from execution at 2 de Diciembre . I also said we had rescued Reverend Longfaeroe from the wheel and beasties . It did not convince them , did confuse them . We were bound and dragged by our feet through the gate , dumped in a wire-covered pit they must have used for burning sheep remains . We lay there in fetid , maggoty mud through a long night of fireballs on the cliffsides above us . The screams were distant . Port Stanley was an outpost of the kingdom of fire ; we had grown accustomed , just lay there and listened to the wind rushing into the vacuum of fire , smelled that gasoline miasma . When they came for us at dawn , we were resigned . I took my last comfort in that Iceberg had guarded our pit nightlong . We were blindfolded , dragged up steps , thrown down steps , pushed against a stone wall . I thought it my end and was not ready ; nor was I prepared for the surprise when they removed the blindfolds and we found ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor , the headquarters of the combined commands of the Falkland Dependencies . It smelled of whale oil and defeat-crackling radios , maps like grave plots . There was a long pause when we seemed forgotten , then a short gray man , thick arms and legs , a huge hairy head , old and very tired but unbent in a great sealskin coat , turned to me , asking , " Ye them that rescued Frazer boys from Patties ? " He looked into my eyes and saw my half-truth . That face , it tightened to stone . " What know ye of my sons ? " continued Elephant Frazer . I replied the full truth , fast and certain , then I started to beg forgiveness . He turned away , told the sergeant to get us out . " No ! " I kicked at the sergeant , shouting at Elephant Frazer . " I lost my friends and boat in that raid . I was wrong to lie , and I 'm sorry for it . It kept us alive . We did help Germanicus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said if my friends were alive , they 'd come here . I have to find them . I need a boat , to get back to my family on Mead 's Kiss . " " Yerr family ? " said Elephant Frazer , spinning back to me.  | " Do n't we each have families ? What 's yerrs to me ? What 's mine to ye ? A thousand families out there I can name , three times that I never knew . What help , what boat , when the Patties come ? " " It 's all I have , sir , please ? " I said . " Get on ! Beggar 's fate we 've not shot ye ! " " Germanicus Frazer told me to thank God I got here , and to help them that need it . I need your help . " Elephant Frazer relaxed at that . I would learn later that I had quoted him to himself . " God 's truth about the parson ? Him praying and the beasties let ye be ? " I said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better than Patties ? " " I said it , " said Lazarus . " Ye 're no Pattie , " said Elephant Frazer . " I 'm an American citizen , " said Lazarus . " Ye 're a beastie or ye 're a Volunteer , laddie . What ye said , tell Frazer it ai n't so . " " You are willing to murder men because they 're brownskinned , and those beasties because they 're hungry . You make them beasts . It 's true , and there 's nothing you can do to me that will change that . " I liked Lazarus Furore then ; I loved him for his words , and especially because he did not care to defend himself . He could be a braggart ; he was also daring , and if one listened closely , he meant what he said . I liked Elephant Frazer then also . He too did not defend himself . They challenged each other with bitter silence . Neither relented . Elephant Frazer said , " I ca n't hate you , lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volunteers , that 's what keeps ye alive , not me , not yerr talk . If ye find yerr friends , I wo n't help ye more than this . Ye 're Volunteers till we 're done , then it 's every man , every family , for it . If ye run before , we 'll shoot ye as beasties . Get on ! Ye 're in the fire detail . And if ye see the parson , tell him keep singing till kingdom come . " We dug out charcoal-like corpses for two brutal weeks ? burned hands , bad backs , soot so thick we tasted it and not the rations . Iceberg distinguished us because she was expert at smelling the living from the dead . One of those living , whom we found under a collapsed building , was Christmas Muir , a sealer ; he had  | come to the Falklands to help his brother 's family , had lost his brother to the Patties and the widow and two boys to a fireball . We did not find Black Crane , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortress to lose freedom . I can not recall if the cholera broke out before the Patties launched their final drive , or if the crush of beasties fleeing before the Pattie scourge brought the cholera , or if it all happened at once . Christmas Muir , who said he could tell an ill wind from a fatal one , said the verdict on Port Stanley was set . Cholera is a middling dying , not as terrifying as the plague that kills like fire , not as slow as scurvy with the cure so simple but impossible at sea or on the ice . Nonetheless , cholera is a finish . People collapse , can not eat , excrete so it seems their insides are running out , then melt with fever . I came to appreciate why the fear of it had paralyzed and then dismantled the British Commonwealth , contributing to the abandonment of the Falkland Dependencies . There is a vaccine , and we loyalists had it ; it is a temporary clemency , and fixed a timetable for the loyalists to quit Port Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to do before winter . The evacuation began with several ships out in convoy every night , risking the blockade to run southeast eight hundred miles to South Georgia . The command drew in the defenders as the port burned and emptied . The Patties must have suffered the cholera as well , because their attacks were haphazard . The fall winds brought hail , huge seas , thick black clouds hurtling from the west . And then there were the seaquakes that rumbled increasingly beneath us , which we learned from Christmas Muir were the result of enormous volcanic eruptions way to the south , beyond the Scotia Sea , on the peninsula of Antarctica and off Antarctica 's shore on the South Shetland Islands . I record here the first I ever heard of Satan 's Seat . " Poachin ' off Coronation isle , I was , that first summer she let go , " said Christmas Muir one night in the shelter , " and ' t were fearsome , sealer 's fate . Bergy bits spun like tops and sea shakes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We was in the backwash of this shock wave . We got to lee of shag rock , quick , tell ye , fer that tidal wave picked up floes and flung ' em . Ice down there he black now , sort of kicked up , carved in twists . It 's meltin '  | the ice , on Graham Land . That 's how 'd they called it . Satan 's Seat . Big as Hell ; hot , ye can fix on that . I never seen it , do n't wish it . South Orkney 's close as I been , and that ai n't the same since the shakin ' started . Makes the whales and seals easy , I admit , kind of stunned , do n't run on ye . The black ice islands are fearsome , pieces of Hell ten miles long . Satan 's Seat . " Otter Ransom listened to my translation , then said he had seen a volcano on Spitzbergen in the 1980s and that though it had closed down the mines and scared the Russians badly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan 's Seat was hot enough to melt ice , it must be part of a chain of eruptions . " Might be , " said Christmas Muir , grinning , " lot of wee demon seats , a union meetin ' in Hell ! " We thought this an excellent jest , which pleased Christmas Muir , a grimy little man , forty years alive and thirty of that a sealer . He liked us because we had saved his life and because the other Volunteers treated him like an outsider too , since he had quit fighting after cutting his brother off a wheel . He liked to spellbind us with sealer talk  --  broad , imaginary , ten times more than truth  --  and continued the same next morning about Satan 's Seat . " The worst of it be this . I did n't see it myself , heard it , ye take it as sealer 's truth . There 's black fumes gushin ' out of Satan 's Seat , they say , and when the winds  --  them winds ai n't like this here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice blowin ' off the plateau like white fire , then that black cloud above Satan 's Seat takes shape of a giant figure . Hard to say what . Mate of mine , Norwegian salt , said he seen a man 's face with whiskers , wearin ' iron , same 's them sorts talk of their old god Odin . Odin ? He was pretty-headed like that , my mate , could n't trust him . Others said they saw what they wanted . Mark me , more than some said they saw a face . What I favored fer myself was them that said they seen a ram 's head . Blunt snout , big horns curled back . There 's more . At night  --  and night down there be dark , matey , long and dark , six months long and dark , what makes a man sad and filled up with memories , that long and dark night  --  then that face of that giant black ram glows . He lights up when the sea shakes and the ice islands crack apart  --  bang ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the floes . Big albatross all black and stunned , sink fer swimmin ' ! That black giant ram 's face glows . They say that face has a smile to it .  | Get that , he 's happy . I 'm no good Christian . No time . I do n't favor it still . What 's damned funny to the Divil ? " The last two weeks at Port Stanley are a single dark episode for me . The attack the first week was from the west , the Patties sending armed beasties at our forward redoubts . The command withdrew us to an inner perimeter , anchored by a shore battery north of the inlet on the cliff 's plateau , two concrete wharves seaward protecting a thin rocky beach on the Atlantic , and the stonebuilt Presbyterian church guarding the quay road . The Falkland Irregulars formed a rescue team to bring in those cut off in the hills to the south ; none came back . The second week began with the Patties making an amphibious landing across from the northern scissor blade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves over the harbor . The Patties established fireposts on our abandoned redoubts . We traded nuisance fire the next day , watched as the Patties put up wheels with Volunteers and Irregulars lashed and alive above the jetty at the mouth of the harbor . We three , with Christmas Muir , had been relieved from the fire detail . We were armed and assigned to the graveyard of the Presbyterian church , its high wall topped by jagged glass . Rumors said that Elephant Frazer , the new commander-inchief with the other senior officers dead or wounded in the caves , had rejected a demand to surrender . There was also word that Volunteers were straggling in , that one of the Frazer sons had arrived by boat at the south point of the inlet . An Irregular officer came at supper to tell us Port Stanley was done . It was our choice to stay or to evacuate in longboats . The six Irregulars chose to fight , took their rations and went back to the wall . We Volunteers counted off by fours , signifying how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Christmas Muir and I counted 3 . I do not recall any untoward feelings inside me that night as we waited for a mass attack that did not come . I was hungry , very frightened of dying , very tired , curious if it had been Germanicus or Samson Frazer who had come in . I did think much of how Grandfather would have judged my conduct during my weeks among the Volunteers . I prayed while I huddled from the wind  | and the rain . I am certain I felt no vengeance , had no more need of killing my enemy than I did of quitting . The big storm that started during the night slowed the Pattie attack and our retreat the next day . The Atlantic tossed up angrily , belittling any violence we men might do . The number 1 's left us , and early in the afternoon the number 2 's were called . We three did not talk at our parting  --  Otter Ransom did smile , Lazarus kept his head down . I sat by Christmas Muir , with Iceberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word came to us at the Presbyterian church soon after that the evacuees were pinned down on the embarkation beach more by nature than by the murderous volleys off the mountainside . Elephant Frazer nearly lost control of the Volunteers then  --  there could not have been two hundred of us left  --  because the notion of starting an eight hundred  --  mile voyage in an open boat in such a storm was hardly less frightening than facing the Pattie wheels . Some volunteers did come back to the church . We heard that one was shot for mutiny . Christmas Muir and I were called at twilight . We dodged sniper fire over the open ground , our way marked by corpses to the crescent-shaped embarkation beach on the Atlantic , east of the settlement . We found Volunteers pressed so close to the cliff face along the shore that they seemed part of the rock , the surf crashing up almost to cover them . There were pools of burning gasoline from the Pattie fireballs floating on the wave crests , and with each new rush of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , I could see the evacuation boats being brought up one at a time around the point , risking the Pattie bombardments from the west . I got down on the beach and was assigned a place in line . I boosted Iceberg up on my shoulders to keep her from the surf . It was then  --  turning and twisting away from the cold water  --  that I spied Black Crane . They were bringing her about the far wharf and into the breakers toward the beach . She was manned by Volunteers , no sign of Orlando the Black or the Turks . I pointed her out to Christmas Muir . " It 's my boat ! " I screamed . Christmas Muir looked quickly , said , " Do n't , matey . Stay in line , stay in line . Do n't , it 's mutiny if you go out there . "  | I would not control myself . I dropped Iceberg and we ran for Black Crane , out of turn , against all discipline . Just as suddenly , Orlando the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; they waved and pointed at me . We all were shoved back against the cliff by a wave , and when the sea drew back to expose beach to run on , I struggled again toward Black Crane . Orlando the Black boomed , " Go back . No ! " I waded through the water near him . He and Lazarus wrestled me against the rock as a new wave poured upon us . They started to laugh with relief at reunion , but their joy disappeared when they realized my intention . I said , " I have to get to her . It 's my boat ! " Orlando the Black pleaded , " Germanicus Frazer brought us back , Grim ! Do n't do it ! Wait your turn ! We 're together ! Little Dede Gone is dead with fever . But Germanicus Frazer saved me and Wild Drumrul ! He 'll kill you if you try it ! It 's their boat now ! " I pushed him aside as the surf took us again . Lazarus tried to hold me , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no use ! It wo n't help them now . They 're gone ! " " Grandfather would n't quit me ! " I replied . " Never ! " I got clear of them and ran before the surf pounded up again , thinking not of my peril as a mutineer , nor of my debt to Germanicus for rescuing Orlando the Black and Wild Drumrul , thinking only of Black Crane and what she represented  --  my family . I had no plan . I wanted her . Orlando the Black and Lazarus pursued me . And up ahead , coming down the beach to intercept me , were Germanicus and Motherwell . I got into the water . Germanicus had his pistol out , shouted , " Grim Fiddle , do n't make me ! I order you to get back ! " All their imploring was then drowned out by a new barrage of fireballs that walked across the water toward the beach . Iceberg nipped at my leg . I fought the waves with my being . I saw Black Crane before me , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her at the helm and oars . Rather , I beheld a vision : I saw Peregrine and Israel and Cleopatra ; I saw Grandfather standing up and pointing at me . I saw him thunder , " Damn all men who have eyes and ears and hearts but will not see and hear and turn to understand Lord God 's judgment on the sins of the unbelievers ! "  | I stopped . I turned . I heard Germanicus cry , " Divil take ye ! " I saw Orlando the Black throw out his arms in a dive . Iceberg took me down by the neck into a breaker . A fireball plunged directly atop Black Crane . I remember coming up , choking , watching Black Crane yanked out of the water in two pieces and flung in fragments toward the cliffs . I remember the blast of heat . I remember bodies floating in the surf . I remember Germanicus and Motherwell hauling me out of the burning water . I remember Christmas Muir declaring that I was no mutineer , that I was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was badly hurt , that the " nig " was cut up , and the wolf was broken . I remember Wild Drumrul squatting over me , saying , " Fire , be cool to my brother . " I remember feeling my face hot and tight , my beard gone , same for my hair , and a tear on my throat that I could put a finger into . I remember Germanicus telling me he would have shot me . And I remember telling him , " There is no God of Love . It is a lie . No God who loves would do this , make us fight and die because we want to get home . Take everything from us . Abandon us . Kill us . There is no God of Love . Peregrine fought his whole life , just to get home . God broke him , left him to sin and die alone . Sent Charity Bentham to torment him , then took her from him , took what little he had of his own . And when we tried to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy and Earle are left to die . Killed by what ? There is no God of Love . God is a monster . He 's a God of Hate . I denounce him as no better than Satan , whom he sent down from heaven for pride . What a lie ! What is more arrogant than to dangle Charity before Peregrine , to dangle Black Crane before us , then to take it back ? It is cruel and hateful and senseless . It is pride and stupidity . I hate Lord God . That is what he understands . Hate and murder and torture . I hate him ! " After that , Grim Fiddle does not remember . There was a black fantasy , a gruesome nightmare , and I was the face inside it , but I can not recall it keenly enough to record it here . I write flatly that I do not remember what I did . It is a darkness for me . I have been told my conduct . I can record that . I refused evacuation as wounded . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I murdered beasties all night , took one of the heavy automatic weapons and held the graveyard . I led the Irregulars  | against a firepost and murdered Patties and beasties with my hands . No one told me how I got from the Presbyterian church to the last barricades on the concrete wharves the next day , because none of the men I fought with in that graveyard survived to tell . I was said to have cursed any man who told me to fall back . I swung at Longfaeroe when he tried to sing psalms over my foul words at the enemy , the sea , at the " God of Hate . " When the last boat was ready and Germanicus begged me to follow him , it was said I grabbed ordnance and charged the quay road again , alone . Germanicus and Motherwell pursued me . We were cut off by beasties . I charged their position , which by accident took me back to the wharves . It was said that I desecrated the corpses with a knife , that Germanicus shot me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have torn at the dead and dying . I was said to have eaten the dead . Motherwell and half a dozen others finally clubbed me down by trickery after I turned on the Volunteers . They thought me dead , and the reason I was taken off East Falkland was that Germanicus would not leave what he thought was my corpse for the Pattie wheels . And it was said that Longfaeroe prayed over my body in the longboat as we cleared the breakers , asking his Jehovah to forgive me for " the blackest words ever said , a serpent 's mouth . " All this I learned much later , and incompletely ; there are some things done by me there that no one would ever tell me . It is not for me now to declare what was true , what was sealer 's talk . It is for me to declare that the weight of my shameful , wicked conduct was something I bore hard in the years of remorse that followed . I became afraid of myself . I came to understand that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion or limits . At Port Stanley 's finish , I learned that I was that most reviled of men by Christian Norse , that most revered of men by pagan Norse , a shape-changer . In this peculiar way , Mother 's magic had passed to me . I can not now say how much of my nature was also derived from the anger in Peregrine that was revealed when he murdered Cesare Furore , nor how much was the cruelty in Grandfather that was revealed when he vouchsafed the razing of the North . I now declare this : Grim Fiddle met abandonment with pitiless abandon . The simple truth was that Grim Fiddle was no simple Christian  | soul . In battle , in deepest distress , in exile without hope , Grim Fiddle was cursed with the strength of a dozen dozen men , with the relentlessness and ravenousness of a wolfpack , with the fact that he can not be killed by ordinary and mortal means . Grim Fiddle was a berserker . I am a berserker.  | page deleted  | page deleted  | The God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I denied him at Port Stanley . It is a rational theme . I feel compelled here to respond to the Grim Fiddle who boasted of , as he cursed , a " God of Hate . " Pagan Grim Fiddle welled up to drown out Christian Grim Fiddle , had to lie to cover his shame for doubt and murder . I feel that shame now for what he  --  I ? said and must show that I understand now that the dark was in my mouth , I was wrong , wrong . The God of Love is the Christian God . He was Jesus ' Father . As I read the Fiddle Bible , Jesus spoke of a Father who provided in famine , weakness , doubt , who welcomed the repentant and especially the meek into the Kingdom of Heaven . Jesus ' Father was kind , patient , fair-minded , sweet , forgiving . He negotiated more than he judged . He loved his children so much that he permitted a profoundly costly deal , that the unjust should arrest his son , persecute him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by believing in the wisdom of Jesus , the mortal son of a loving father , the children of the earth could come to revelation and redemption . This is a sublime tale , full of tricks and mysteries , which have been made that much more confounding by later apologists whose motives seem to me suspect  --  creeds for power , heresy trials for aggrandizement , orthodoxy for contrived unanimity . I can not comprehend much of Christian theology because of sloth of mind and ill education . The idea of the Holy Trinity eludes me . What I do get from Jesus ' story is joy , for as Molly once told me , " the good guys win , sort of . " It is wonderful to consider that into the breach the God of Love sent his son to save not the strong but the weak , not the pious but the most impious . It is also grand to think that Jesus scoffed at the notion of his being a warlord king , took a crown of thorns rather than of gold , and suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave man ; his courage was forgiveness . I also find in the Gospel tale a nagging tableau : that somehow , through hunger or lust or doubt ( the very  | temptations that Jesus took courage against in the wilderness ) , God 's children had fallen from the salvation they enjoyed by the grace of God , who brought them out of Egypt and into the promised land of milk and honey , and that it was required for the God of Love to sacrifice a human being to preserve and advance his plan . What nags at me is this : What happens once , reign to ruin , happens easier and worse when it occurs again  --  fall , salvation , exodus , fall . Why have I opened this ? I do not mean this question rhetorically . I demand it of myself . I know I say that my blasphemy at Port Stanley obliges me to demonstrate my reading and understanding of the God of Love , the true God , who was Jesus ' Father . I sense now there is more to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentiment of something sinister that has haunted me many years . I feel I am compelled here to declare my understanding of Jesus in order to show that I am certain that Grim Fiddle was not a savior . This declaration reaches ahead again , too far ahead to make sense of my frustration here . I must first relate my six years on South Georgia before I can begin to speak of the lost and the saved . Nevertheless I am crushed with a need to interrupt the continuity in my story to pronounce that I know Grim Fiddle 's God of Hate was a lie , that I know that the talk of Grim Fiddle as a savior was a lie . When they talked of me at my trial as a Jesuslike champion of the fallen , lost , exiled , unrepentant , they talked self-serving distortion and the politics of falsehood . What trial ? I realize I hint at matters that I have not prepared . This bewilders me . I must be deeply upset by the recounting of the loss of Black Crane , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . I must wait , and specify , and explore the meaning of the events of my life , before I can speak of my trial . Let it be sufficient here to say that certain men who did not know me , who were from the enemy camp , who said they were speaking in my defense , whom I can not know whereof , they made much of my so-called virgin birth , my so-called invasion of a temple , my so-called assembly of disciples at Anvers Island . What distortions and nonsense they heaped , and for their own purposes , not in my defense at all , sneakily confusing the dark story of Grim Fiddle  --  bastard , fugitive , warlord  --  with the compassionate story  | of Jesus , son of the God of Love , disputatious preacher , king of the meek . Those distorters used a timeworn trick that has been used by many apologists for many outlaws who have fallen to crime , yet then enjoyed undue reward in myth as revolutionary heroes . I shall not give those odd-tongues any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false messiahs . My trial was the same sort of falsehood . When I get to it , it will be clear that my time at Anvers Island was no saving work , was the vengeance of a furious , criminal , fallen , pagan fool . I have already recorded enough to give the lie to those first two twisted claims . I have confessed the facts of Grim Fiddle to bury what could have become another deceptive myth  --  Grim Fiddle was like Jesus . I write no , completely no . Lamba was a virgin ; mine was not virgin birth ; there was blood . My father was not a spirit , was Peregrine Ide , in a telephone booth , a weepy , drunken , angry man . I did get inside a king 's palace at seventeen , not grandly and righteously , rather as a servant 's servant , and not to dispute men and women of worldly learning , rather to aid my family . I shall not pursue this further . I am probably overdoing . I do have a foreboding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie that Grim was messiah of the abandoned on the ice . It has been such a long time , lies can seem as fertile as truth , bring forth rotten harvest certainly  --  food for glib men with bad motives regardless . I can not know what that sort might have done , have done , after my trial and imprisonment , and I can not get this confession out to show they were false witnesses . It likely came to nothing . I deserve , infamy deserves , forgetting . I read the stories of the infamous in the Fiddle Bible however , and there seem other ends : what they did was long-remembered in poetic lamentations . No more of this . I have been foundered by the rage and loss at Port Stanley . I have drifted from my time line . I have grasped at woe , shall now withdraw my hand , let it pass , for fear that contrived worry might become self-fulfilling . There is magic in the world ; the bad magic can work like that . I am nagged by so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I shall take my own advice and keep going . I stress , though it seems pretension , necessary only because in my Norse way I see the worst possible as most probable , that I am a man , my Hielistos at Anvers were hutnan , we erred and failed and came to ruin as prideful fools , as  | victims who fell to crime , as false disciples of false gods , as wretches elected by no one for nothing but murder . On South Georgia , for six years , there was a more immediately troubling distortion for me than the much later savior talk . It was said that I was a new David . Longfaeroe said it . Longfaeroe claimed that I was a new David for his flock on South Georgia and for those lost to the Patties on the Falklands . Longfaeroe would visit me , as my pastor , in my shepherd 's hut high in the wind-gouged pastures above the main settlement on Cumberland Bay . There I had been settled by the Frazers , who took pity on poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to me , would sing psalms to me , would tell me that he knew me , had known me when I crawled from beneath the cart to his side during the massacre on East Falkland 's heath , had known me when he watched me fight the Patties and beasties , and that what he knew was that I was sent by Jehovah to him as a " wee David . " Longfaeroe meant David the Hebrew , youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem , who was called to King Saul as a harpist , who rose , by bravura and luck , to become himself King of Israel and Judah . Longfaeroe 's prodigy requires brief explanation of the Reverend Learned Sharon Longfaeroe . He was born in the Highlands of Scotland , brought up in the Wee Kirk of Scotland , a literal-minded group of Calvinists , also hard-minded , high-minded , vigilant , hungry for inspiration . He was the youngest son of a sergeant major , eventually killed in an imperial debacle in Egypt , and of an orphaned Jewess raised by nuns in Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sergeant major . She was a second wife , produced a second family as soon as she removed to the sergeant major 's mother in Scotland . Longfaeroe 's upbringing was as confession-laden as mine . As the " bairn " of an intractable clan and an independent Jewess , Longfaeroe made his way by contrary trial and error to university , where he took a degree in divinity . He would have needed high learning to sort out the feuding between his mother and grandmother . After , he answered a call not unlike his father 's , to be a soldier , this time for Christ . As a missionary of the Wee Kirk , he endured refugee camps in Africa , the Middle East , and South Asia until he was  | invalided back to Scotland with malaria and what he said was " coldness of soul . " He had married in the Middle East , a beauty , an Armenian Christian , and tried to settle her and his two infant daughters in a Highlands community with sour patience for outsiders . There was trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed on himself , as is the way with hardset Calvinists  --  what goes wrong is their fault , what goes right is God 's handiwork . Longfaeroe saw to it that he was called away , far away , to South Georgia , with the help of one of his father 's comrades-in-arms , Sergeant Major Balthazar Frazer , Elephant Frazer 's oldest brother . That was the early 1980s . Longfaeroe brought with him his wife and surviving daughter and a sense of mission that was farfetched : to bring the Scots-Irish and Norse of the Falkland Dependencies , rude fisherman , misanthropic shepherds and sealers , to Christ . First he had to gather them to church . The war in the Falklands elevated him from the butt of derision to one of the strengths of the resistance . I have mentioned his notion of himself as a strong tower . He lost his wife in a drowning in the early days of the war , another accident . I was told it did not touch him as had the loss of his daughter . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what they , and everyone , came to respond to was a man who was a book . Longfaeroe 's mind was the Psalter . He was a fickle , aloof minister , a garbled and not very fetching preacher . His gift was that beautifully rugged singing voice . When he lifted his head above his bent body to sing a psalm , he was inspirational and sublime . The rush of the sea was his choir , he was the soloist . And Longfaeroe did not make the psalms sound as Grandfather did  --  full of dread , dark warnings , last screams . Longfaeroe made them seem thanksgivings , full of hope and promise . It was the promise of the psalms that seemed to have led him to a visionary conclusion . His psalms were said to have first been sung by King David . Longfaeroe came to believe that his flock on South Georgia , spread over half a million square miles of violent ocean in their vocation of killing whales and seals , would come to Christ and their redemption if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought together Israel and Judah . Longfaeroe had encouraged another as " wee David " since his arrival on South Georgia and the explosion of the hate in the  | Dependencies that had brought the war . Longfaeroe had chosen Samson Frazer , eldest son of Elephant and Dolly Frazer , heir to the large Frazer holdings in sheep and sealing . Samson was said to have been the quickest eye and surest hand on South Georgia ? the stuff of faultless heroes . He had been a hero in a large battle on West Falkland early in the war , and was made legend for his rescue of Luff Gaunt 's crew after the senior commander of the Volunteers failed to break the Pattie blockade on Port Stanley and died for his cause . Samson must have been a good man , strong , fierce , bold . Samson had also been the husband of Longfaeroe 's daughter , Abigail , and the father of Longfaeroe 's dearest possessions after his Psalter , two grandsons . I have told the story of Samson 's death , presumed death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as I arrived . Longfaeroe said that he was reawakened by his grief for Samson , that he was more convinced of his vision than ever before . He said Samson had served to prepare the way for me , that Samson had found me , leading those four longboats across Falkland Sound . This sort of justification for accident and tragic turn can become heartless . It did hurt Abigail when she heard it . Longfaeroe persisted , told everyone who I was , told them he had known me when he first saw me . This was disingenous : he had questioned me at length before he settled on me as his new candidate . That was not an easy task ; I was badly wounded when I was landed on South Georgia , babbled madly as I mended , and spent my first two years there either speechless or mumbling garbled nonsense to sheep and misty shadows . I was a long while recovering from my first episode of darkness , and looked dire ? shrunken , hairless , unwashed , and barely fit for Iceberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my appearance and woozy conduct , however ; my repulsiveness attracted him , as harmony to harp . Longfaeroe was not Grandfather , far short ; not that cruel , or full of himself , or limitless , furious , inspired . Longfaeroe was weaker and , I suppose , stronger for it . It might help to think that Longfaeroe played the minor prophet to Grandfather 's Jeremiah . He was a man who demonstrated peculiar and extravagant resolve nonetheless . He could bend a will , even a wandering one like mine . The craftiest trick he used on me  --  when I could barely  | talk in full sentences on my own  --  was to teach me long passages of the books of Samuel ( which contain the David story ) , substituting rote for reason in my mind . I can still do much of it without consulting the Fiddle Bible , like the words of the Lord of Hosts reminding David of his call : " I took you from the pastures and from following the sheep to be the prince of Israel , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wherever you have gone , and have destroyed all the enemies in your path . I shall make you a great name among the great ones of the earth . " I recall now how David thought to reply to the Lord of Hosts , asking him in effect , " You do keep your promises ? " David was concerned with guarantees between parties with unequal enfranchisement , and wisely so . It is my experience that the always dangerous relationship between master and subject usually goes wrong  --  makes one a tyrant and the other a slave  --  because there is no guarantee of reason and decency mutually exchanged that can survive natural disaster and human crime : Lazarus had his written constitution ; I had my faith in Grandfather . Neither was enough guarantee , but more of this later . Over three years , I regained most of my faculties , also regained my weight and strength and demeanor , though my hair never did grow back properly  --  I was mostly bald , with long locks over my eyes . Nature also returned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist Longfaeroe 's hammering at my identity . I argued that me being Davidic made no sense , that such proceeded from something wild-eyed in Longfaeroe , some sad foolishness to retreat from the world by cramming it into a familiar illusion that seemingly had authority because it was based on the biblical canon . I did not say it that way , since I did not then have the wherewithal ; that was what I thought , however inarticulately . Longfaeroe made the mistake of cultists , investing a found object with magical powers that seem tangible because they are actually the longing of the investor for recognizable truth . I do not mean to defame him . He was good to me , if he also confused me ; in his way he trained my mind by attacking it . Longfaeroe was manipulative , fervent , long-winded , cunning , playful , pouty . I listened to him , because he was my friend and I wanted him to like me . I defended myself , because I had to spend most of my tine ? alone and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Longfaeroe that the one similarity I would admit between me and David was shepherding . I said that I was a shoddy shepherd . I suffered lapses , talked to the mountainsides when I should have been counting spring lambs , was inept at shearing despite Germanicus 's patient lessons . If not for Iceberg ( she was pregnant by one of Goldberg 's pups when we landed , recovered from her wound to deliver five wolves ) I would have lost my herds in the winter storms ; she , the wolf , trained herself and her pups , and the litters of half-breed collie-wolves that followed , to go against nature and to tend the sheep , did so out of loyalty to and love for me , and I took it then and still do as a profound example of what faith and kindness can do  --  civilize the beast . I further objected to Longfaeroe that I was not the youngest son of a shepherd of Bethlehem , was the only son , and bastard at that , of an exiled murderer who had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraged , applied his imagination . He reworked my life , twisting my tale of how I had been fetched by Cleopatra to Grandfather at Stockholm  --  which , Longfaeroe said , had deferred Grandfather from his despotism ? to have been the same as how Saul , King of the Hebrews , fell into melancholy tempers while making war on the Philistines , and that only when David the harpist was ushered into Saul 's tent to sing songs did Saul return to Jehovah 's plan . This is typical of the liberty Longfaeroe was willing to take with truth in order to advance his plan . I can review this matter more dispassionately than the savior talk , because it began and ended with Longfaeroe , and what trouble it caused I left behind on South Georgia . As I recall it , I see that the reason Longfaeroe 's notion bothers me is that there might have been weight to his fixation on finding me a " wee David . " It had its dark , wrongheaded side in that Longfaeroe pressed on me that David did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more appropriate to the travail of the Hebrews , a God of Fear and Trembling . Longfaeroe said this was the same I spoke of as a " God of Hate " at Port Stanley . He was wrong about that ; I was pagan then , denying God more than refashioning his identity . At the time , I was not fully informed of my pagan self , and was confused by Longfaeroe 's contrivance . Now , I can reject it as an ex- ample of the damage overeager visionaries can do to their students . Yet , Longfaeroe 's obsession also introduced a telling thought to me , one that I carried with me afterward and can still be irked by because I take the point . Longfaeroe pressed on me that David 's story was more compelling than any other in the Bible because David was an impaired hero , made many mistakes , was remorseful , guilt-wracked in old age , when he had to watch his sons undo his work with squabbling and treachery . Longfaeroe said that , like me , David rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philistines ' champion , Goliath , as I had risen from the ranks of the Volunteers to slay Patagonians and beasties . ( Perhaps the most unhappy coincidence between me and David  --  one that Longfaeroe never made because I concealed from him my longing  --  was that concerning the coveting of another man 's woman : David had his Bathsheba , Grim had his Cleopatra . ) I am not saying that I was Davidic . I am saying that Longfaeroe provided me a story of a king that reveals most of the lessons and ruin of kingship . I have mentioned how I was ignorant of Lazarus 's political science . Longfaeroe gave me a course in politics that I believe unequaled . It is all there , in the two books of Samuel , and as I read the Fiddle Bible I nod in sadness . I was a warlord king , like David , but not of a land of milk and honey , rather one of ice and wretchedness . The differences between us are profound and entire . David was artful , daring , boastful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh and strong of spirit , generous to his people and unmovable before his enemies , a wise statesman and patient judge , a visionary and builder , above all a man who worshiped his God , the true God , with humility and zeal . Grim Fiddle was not any of that . He might have been . He was not . Grim Fiddle lost and fought for vengeance and lost the more . Grim Fiddle betrayed , ran away , succumbed to every temptation , turned from every friend , coveted power , murdered multitudes , stands condemned as the darkest of black princes , a monster . Then there is a final philosophical consideration , since I have haphazardly and unintentionally permitted this to become a discussion of my identity . It is my notion , was no one else 's , though  | it was Abigail , Longfaeroe 's daughter and Samson 's heavyhearted widow , who introduced it to me in passing . It does not threaten me , as the savior talk does and the David talk did ; indeed , it fetches me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was about the time of the visit of the British man-o ' - war  --  no , that was earlier . It was about the time of the foundered plague ship . It was certainly about the time Abigail and I became lovers . Abigail had been the one who supervised my nursing after I was landed on South Georgia and taken to the Frazer camp . I did not see her again for a year , saw her infrequently when I went down to the Frazer camp on shepherding matters . The first she spoke to me was about a lamb she wanted for a pet for one of her sons . I thought her curt , very sad , aloof , lean like her father and hard like the Frazers . Then , one day in early summer , with the sun breaking through to flash gold on the gray landscape of the high moors , she came up to my hut with her eldest son and three other of the Frazer brood . She said they were on a hike . I gave them the shelter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shy of people other than Longfaeroe and Germanicus . I was afraid I would have one of my spells , start babbling or ranting . She came out to me to ask me why I was looking west , toward one of the stark passes through the surrounding mountains . I had not been aware that I was , and when I thought that looking west had become my routine stance , to where I had abandoned my family , I turned away from her to weep . I was pathetic , a huge , tearful , clumsy shepherd ; perhaps that is what attracted her back the next day , alone . The incident I am thinking of happened later that summer . Abigail was cooking for me at the time , on the hearth fire Germanicus had helped me build in my hut . She was a good cook , a better listener  --  a tall , limber woman , her hair cut as short as a boy 's , small breasts and tight composure , her thin arms swinging over the pots . I recall mentioning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised to return that day . I hinted at my difficulty with him and the David talk . I had been cautious not to complain to her about her father , unsure of her opinion , presuming she would not welcome my criticism , would see me as an ingrate . Abigail surprised me then , drew me out on my complaint ,  | then lost her temper , " Not that again , Grim . That 's Dad 's sickness . Him and his holy visions on the cliffs . He killed mum with ' em . She went up to fetch him down and fell . " I said that it was me having those visions . I saw Grandfather searching for me endlessly . I saw Cleopatra in chains . I saw Peregrine dead . " Mind me , Dad 's using you to make himself swell up . Dad did that to dear Samson , and he believed him . The lot did . Do n't you tell me the Frazers have their ways . The Frazers 're weak minds , and are already swelled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chance and stripped this island of its boys and left us women for what ? I mark them , mark Dad special for it . He knows . I told him when they sailed , that if he did n't bring my Samson back , he was no father to me . That 's why he do n't come up when he knows me here . Fight him , with your mind . Samson was a good man , kind when he wanted , but Lordie , he was not clever . You be that , good and kind and clever . You have learning , enough , and you have that Israel friend of your dad 's . Keep at it . Never give Dad a handhold . Do n't ever let me see you with a harp . Ah , Grim , it ai n't funny . Stay what you are , sweet and sad . Be more reluctant than Moses . Eat . " It was just an image to her , " more reluctant than Moses . " She never mentioned Moses again . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abigail was as full of images as she was of passion , a gentle lover , no , that is not accurate , a ravenous woman . She chewed on me , that lithe body and those sharp teeth , all over me in my hut , in the wind , content with my dogs and melancholy . She said sexual intercourse might be the only softness people like us would ever enjoy , and it was ours to be as hard in calamity as it was to be " terrible hot " in love . I never saw her naked ; it was the cold , and her temperament , for she said she wanted me to know there was a needful part of her that was for me alone to touch and smell and remember , but not for the sins of the eyes . That was her Presbyterian soul in conflict with a heated-up nature . She told me she wanted to love me clear of Germanicus and Longfaeroe ; she said she did not want to keep me ; she said she did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , and she kept at it . She said a man might not have time for killing himself if his woman kept his face to hers , kept him well fed and busy  | fixing the house , tending the flock , waiting for her to lift skirts . She believed in her father 's Jehovah , not overridingly . There was something private in her that seemed to want to make even God an observer , not judge , not helpmate , to what she could do , her ways . She had her sons , her memories , and what she called " my high dreams . " Yes , I can speculate now how much she came to use me as she claimed Longfaeroe and the Frazers used me , how much what came to be her need for me was part of her fight with the dead husband she faulted herself for not being able to hold , with her love , from self-destruction . This does not mean I am suspect of what she did to me , for me . I liked it much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did want to marry her . She would not let me talk of marriage , though , and so our love was constrained from deepening . Nevertheless , it was a strong love , as mutual and kind and worthy as my love for Cleopatra never was . What blocked it from completeness was her anger at fate and at her father . She would not say it that way , proposed it sadly , that a woman should have only one husband , and that she had had hers . Sadder , given more time , she might have relented . It is Abigail 's mention of Moses that touches me now ( as I think of her touching me , and her bites  --  she tore flesh ) . This is the first time I have turned Moses over in my mind . It is entirely my rumination , long afterward , harmless , not meant for selfaggrandizement , more to complete my search here , in this pause in my narrative , for the meaning of what I have done . There are no historical parallels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare I see none . I am attracted to Moses as a character . Reading the Fiddle Bible , I find several kinds of Moses : the first is reluctant , the others are miraculous , suffering , prophetic . It is the reluctant Moses I appreciate . He was of humble origins . His mother tossed him to his fate in that reed basket . His rise as a young aristocrat in the pharaoh 's court was luck . Then he murdered for pride , also for frustration , because he had a bad temper , felt lost to his destiny . A fugitive , he fled into the wilderness , became a shepherd by chance and took a wife who loved him and taught him her father 's religion , of the God who dwelled on a mountain . It was on that mountain one day that God , called Jehovah , appeared as a burning bush , a fire that scared Moses . Jehovah told Moses what was required of him . Moses resisted ,  | " Why ? Who am I ? I do not speak well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a complaint that Moses repeated severally throughout his ordeal at the new pharaoh 's court  --  there is always a new pharaoh , how well I know  --  in the desert , on Mount Sinai , at the rocky waters of Meribah where Moses did worse , spoke rashly to Jehovah . I think Moses ' reluctance was the reason Jehovah did not permit Moses to enter the promised land . Moses remained his own man ; Jehovah did not like it . Moses was rash , did talk back to Jehovah , accused Jehovah when things went bad , such as , " Was it me who did this , brought these people out of Egypt where they were miserable and into the desert where they are more miserable and also rebellious ? " Moses no more wanted the job of commander of multitudes than I did . At least , this is true before I let the darkness take hold and I grabbed power at Anvers Island . Moses ' attitude was in great contrast to how David schemed for kingship and how Jesus accepted his mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors ? Would Moses have baited the priests and faced down Satan without complaint ? He would not . God commanded and Moses backed away ; God saved and Moses felt sorry for himself . I am not saying that Grim Fiddle was like Moses . God never talked to me ; I never turned staffs into snakes , a river into blood , or vouchsafed the vengeance of the Angel of Death . I parted no seas , climbed no mountains . It is true that Lamba Time-Thief clobbered me with a staff , that Grandfather 's League turned Stockholm harbor into a bloody river , that I took revenge at my loss of Grandfather 's Angel of Death , that the ice did part before me because of the volcanos , that I did try to climb a volcano to confer with a delusion ; but that is all off-the-point , contrived coincidence , and I mention it here to show that it is folly to pursue such fancy . Yet I realize now that I felt like Moses did in the desert when I struggled with my fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I ponder it now . I did not want what was thrust upon me , what I took when I wore vengeance . In this way I will admit I was like Moses . My errors as warlord king derived from my pride and from my dereliction of duty when success was right before me . I shall show the truth of this later . For now , I am reaching f'or an apology for myself . That I am condemned as a  | criminal and monster is justice . I hate it ; I do not turn it aside . I ask , however , could not one argue , with some slight changes , that Moses ' reluctance and resistance and rashness and anger brought great suffering to the very people he led out of Egypt ? Could not it be argued that Moses might today stand condemned by the sons of Aaron for his interference and cruelty if not that Jehovah tidied up Moses ' excesses and continued to intervene in favor of the Hebrews ? I dispute silence . Perhaps I should not make apology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not want it from Longfaeroe at my hut , should not now turn to speculation and vanity in a work I mean as self-accusation . Moses was not a criminal like me ; he did not murder multitudes . That was my conduct , and it would be disingenuousness like Longfaeroe 's to try to cover my shame with eccentric exegesis . I think now this detour has been worthwhile . I see here something that escaped me before I recounted my reading and understanding of Jesus and David and Moses . Those were three kings to three very different peoples : oppressed Galileans , beleaguered Israelites , enslaved Hebrews . Grim Fiddle was a ruler of people who shared one sure thing with God 's chosen people : they were outcasts , undone , unloved . Grim Fiddle was a bad ruler , and I do not want to obscure that fact by declaring here , in passing , that it might not be possible to take up kingship in any way in this world devoid of refuge , sanctuary , peace , without also taking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This formula only seems to be avoidable if one heeds the lesson of Jesus and takes a crown of thorns as a suffering servant rather than a crown of iron as an insufferable master . I did not follow such wisdom . I was a tyrant 's tyrant  --  capricious , secretive , gory , vain , corrupt . Yet I see now that even in the worst of earthly monarchs , like me , there are elements of Jesus , David , Moses , just as even in the worst of earthly peoples , like my Hielistos and the slaves in the camps , there are elements of the Galileans , Israelites , and Hebrews . This seems a quiet discovery . It may therefore be crucial . Perhaps this helps explain the genesis of all that false talk about my so-called virgin birth , and all Longfaeroe 's bloated talk about my so-called slayings of Goliaths , and my own loose talk about myself as a reluctant shepherd ; it springs from a deep yearning in men to prove  | heavenly and predetermined sponsorship of what men do mundanely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more forgiving of the glib apologists at my trial , and of overeager Longfaeroe on South Georgia , and of myself as I reflect . It might be a long-felt need for authority , for certainty of one 's actions in retrospect , for justification of what one is at the same time regretful for . I should be generous . I should not continue to protest the need of the seekers . It was a mark of their hunger for God 's love . I apologize , then , to those odd-tongues at my trial , and to Longfaeroe , for my peevish suspicions . What can their distortions do to me now ? I was only a transient and counterfeit discovery in their search for an earthly ruler who is blessed with heavenly authority . It came to silence then , shall continue to be nothing . Grim Fiddle was also a bewitched Northman . I am Lamba 's son , and she was a witch . It was Longfaeroe who first assembled the clues to argue that Lamba Fiddle was Lamba Time-Thief . I suppose that what drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail . He could see , by my third summer and the beginning of my love for Abigail , that he was losing my attention , so he grabbed at ever wilder proofs of his vision . He gathered what I told him of Israel 's story of the blond girl in the telephone booth , what I told him of Thord 's story of how Anders Horshead had suspected that the midwife at my delivery , Astra , had been more than she appeared , and what I told him of the bald sibyl and the hag at Sly-Eyes 's party , and fitted all this together until he had the obvious , and some mystery left over . I did try to conceal the whole of Lamba 's portents from him . He did eventually trick it out of me , everything from Skallagrim Strider 's name spoken in ecstasy at my conception to the legend of Skallagrim Strider , to Lamba 's prophecy of Skallagrim Ice-Waster . Longfaeroe seized upon this as if Lamba 's sibylhood was some sort of prophetic calling . There is great confusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes a call to prophecy , yet not so much that Longfaeroe did not know then , as I know now , that for one to argue that Lamba had been called to her task was perverse . Still , Iongfaeroe sidestepped reason , challenged me ,  | " She bore the bairn ! She named him ! She watched over him ! She meant you to be a king ! " I do not recall any extravagant surprise at Longfaeroe 's revelation that Lamba Time-Thief was my mother . I did think it unhappy that Lamba had been an opportunistic mother , that what had begun so bizarrely could only get worse . Longfaeroe was not sympathetic , said that many had endured peculiar mothers , as he had . He would only concede that I had enjoyed more than most orphans , in that my mother had taken steps , painful ones , to make clear to me what she expected . Longfaeroe strangled sense about all this , used my bewilderment to trick more dangerous material out of me , such as my dreams . I dreamed bizarrely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying dragons , rams ' heads , fleets of white ships sailing over seas of blackened faces with shriveled tongues . I did not abide any of this as worthy then , fought off Longfaeroe 's crude interpretations . He thought my dreams referred to his South Georgia and the Falklands . I was frightened that they meant my family was dead . Did I believe I heard the ghost of Skallagrim Strider whispering to me in my sleep ? Did I believe there was any worth to what Lamba Time-Thief , my mother , had told me of Skallagrim Ice-Waster , King of the South ? Did I believe Grandfather lost to me forever ? I believed none of it , which I now understand is the same as believing all of it . Abigail helped me fight off both Longfaeroe 's twists and my own dream life . She told me it was natural to reject asleep what I had not yet been able to accept awake  --  that I was cheated , purposeless , abandoned . She said it was simple melancholy and I should not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , " she said , smiling , " and that 's not for you to hear now , sweet Grim . What you dream is yours . Do n't be telling me it 's some brute dead a thousand years . Do n't give them to Dad . Spare your breath to cool your porridge . What of it if your mum was heartless and cold ? My granny was a proper crag of feeling . My greatgranny would have been human for being a witch . Your mum was a wee girl when she had you . Take her side in it . She was scared of that father of hers and made up stories to hide her fright . A king of what , she said ? Black and hurt half-men ? Begod , she might have tried fairy princes and slimy ogres .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the shape-changed berserker who can not be vanquished , the relentless and vengeful murderer . I do not mean to suggest that I blame my paganism for my crimes , as I do not attribute what truth I have done to godliness . It was all never so clearly served up . What fed me also poisoned me . It was brewed together , the pot stirred by Lamba , Peregrine , Israel , Grandfather , and luck . Pagan luck , holy luck , who is to say and what would it matter ? Grim Fiddle feasted , and was consumed . The metaphor gets it done as well as any : Spare my breath to cool my porridge indeed , Abigail , sweet Abigail . I was lucky . It was luck that the Frazers took me into their family . Germanicus treated me like a lifelong friend , more , made me feel like his older brother , which I took as a kindness and a sadness as I watched him forget himself sometimes and call me Samson . Elephant Frazer , who assumed the governor-generalship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the death of Luff Gaunt Senior , gave me his far-reaching protection and a job . Abigail Longfaeroe Frazer gave me everything except her secrets . The other Frazers  --  they were a large , marrying and breeding family of first , second , and third cousins  --  gave my brothers from Black Crane both help and ambition . It was luck that Lazarus , who was badly burned by the explosion of Black Crane , healed over time , was taken in by the Gaunts ( Frazer inlaws ) , and was rewarded for his learning with a teaching post at the island 's school and eventually with the hand of one of the widowed Gaunt daughters-in-law , Violante  --  who gave Lazarus a daughter , Cleo , soon enough . Christmas Muir and his best mate , Martin Peggs , watched over Wild Drumrul and Otter Ransom , taught them sealing and whale-poaching , sent me shark 's teeth for my rune-carving , my hobby after my darkness lifted . Orlando the Black did the best of all of us , recovering from his wounds quickly , marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having three daughters in three years , being appointed an officer in the reorganized South Georgia Volunteers , being given responsibility for the small settlement on the northeast shore , Shagrock.  | And it was certainly luck that in late spring of my fourth year on South Georgia ( December 1999 ) , Abigail bore me a son . There were very few hard words over this , considering that the child was a bastard and that Abigail had risked her authority on the island by refusing to marry me when everyone knew I was the father . Longfaeroe pondered what his response should be , delivered the news that since I had never been baptized , and since this child needed baptism , he would hold a joint ceremony , just after Christmas . It was the first time he got me into his church , and I realized then the deviousness of the man . Because of the possibility of scandal and scolding , he also got a full house that Sunday , everyone of any authority was present or well represented : Frazers , Gaunts , Roses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins of the flesh , on the mysterious ways of the spirit , on the necessity for men to keep themselves ready for revelation and miracle . Then he baptized me Grim Fiddle , and my son Sam . Sam was also Longfaeroe 's grandson ; that was not sufficient for Longfaeroe to oblige Sam with a last name . Should he have been Fiddle ? Longfaeroe ? Frazer ? It was left undecided , Sam for Samson , and that pleased most . I sat in the first pew with Christmas Muir and Otter Ransom , while Abigail sat on the other side with her mother-in-law and two sons by Samson . It could have been testy , became difficult only once for me , when Longfaeroe looked down at me and said , " Jehovah watches over the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked is endless stumbling . " Abigail sat right up , called over the baby 's whimpering , " That 's more for some than him , Dad . " Afterward , Abigail pushed through the tongue-clatterers to me and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have this day . We have a son . They 'll not take it or him from us , ever . " Then we went arm-in-arm to the party in the adjacent parsonage , a grand affair , Frazer-style , the men in their Volunteer uniforms , the women in control . There were signs of the feuding at the time , and I saw the Harrahs and Lindfirs maneuver with the Hospidar , and Trip Gaunt snub Longfaeroe ; I shall speak of this soon . It was primarily a day for Abbie , and she gave it her joy . Orlando the Black sent a note congratulating me , Christmas Muir and Peggs gave Sam a miniature harpoon , and Lazarus made a speech , sentimental , hopeful , surprising me with his buoyant contentment :  | " You have heard that I come from America , and that Grim Fiddle , now baptized Grim Fiddle , is mostly American . I want you to know that this is not a curse . Among you here , I have discovered there are just ways to love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept his place . I count myself happy to be your schoolmaster , and Grim Fiddle , he just counts Frazer sheep . It 's a good life , while we have it , and if there are disagreements now and then , that is all to the good . Now with my Cleo , and Grim 's Sam , America has landed on South Georgia to stay . " I remember the toasts , the men saying that Sam would become a champion like his father , since I had become legend to the Volunteers for what I had done at the Presbyterian church at Port Stanley . I remember Lazarus dancing with his tall wife , Violante , and then with Abigail , and with the young woman promised to Germanicus , Jane Gaunt . I remember Elephant Frazer gathering me around the waist , making the photographer stand back to get my head in the shot , and then Dolly Frazer pulling me aside to assure me in a quiet voice that she would not rest until she convinced Abigail to marry me . I remember the Volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route Germanicus was supposed to be following in his second reconnaissance of the Falklands . I remember Lazarus saying good night to me . " Do you miss them ? I think of her . I thought naming my baby for her would make it better . It has , I guess . I want you to understand that I was wrong about you . You did what had to be done . There was nothing more you could have tried . Orlando and I talked about you last Christmas when he was down . You were still sick . They could n't have made it . It happened , and I do n't see what we could have done . We want you to know , whatever you decide , we 're with you . Stay here now . These are good people . To hell with that world out there . " And I remember crying that night , apart from Abigail while we cleaned up after the party , until she caught me , made me confess : " For the first time , I begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I speak of my luck . The ancient Norse had wisdom that applied to me on South Georgia , and I make it suit here by paraphrasing : loth good and had luck , and plenty of ' both , must be  | endured in a life time spent in this troubled world . My baptism seemed the line I crossed from good luck to bad once again , and at everyone 's peril . Germanicus returned with dire news soon after . That was his second voyage around the Falklands . During my third summer , he had made his first , sailing the Frazer sealing schooner , King James , in a great arc across the southern Atlantic , bringing back sketchy news of a forbidding quiet on the mainland of South America and observed news that the beasties had taken over West Falkland from the Patties . After his return , in the early fall ending my third year on the island , a ship had foundered off the northeast shore , off Orlando the Black 's Shagrock , and the wreckage that floated ashore hinted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeing plague or had been a plague ship blockaded out of a South African port . This threat was kept a secret by the leadership on South Georgia . Germanicus was ordered to make a more military reconnaissance in my fourth summer , which was why he was away for the baptism party . His mission was manifold : mostly to investigate the possibility of plague , since any such threat would likely come on us from the west ; partly to assess the state of the Falklands ; partly to search for news of or the remains of Samson ; and partly to look over Mead 's Kiss . This last he did not tell me about at the time , at Abigail 's anxious request , because she feared it would cause me a relapse . Germanicus did make a reckless landing on West Falkland , and a march to 2 de Diciembre . Otter Ransom , a mate on King James by then , and Wild Drumrul , a seaman , went along on that march , and the two of them visited me in my hut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands into zones , " said Otter Ransom , nervous , distracted . He was thought a fine figure in town , and I had assumed him happy . He continued , " More beasties on the northern shores , and that 's where they are sick . I 've never seen it . I 've heard of it . We found bodies in a ditch outside the village . Half buried , two or three . They were blue-black , chewed up by birds . I saw these boil things . I knew what it was . We took care coming back . Searched her top to bottom . None of us got it . " I asked him if he was sure it was plague ; it could have been a dozen diseases , including plain infection . " How can we know , unless we get it ? " he said angrily .  | I asked Wild Drumrul if Germanicus knew , or the leadership was guessing , where it came from . " Die Ratten ! " said Wild Drumrul , gesturing in a Moslem way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plague came from everywhere . He had grown to a cautious , faithful man ? beautifully bearded , catlike . He said he had seen the plague in Asia as a boy . He said it was always the same . The rats died . Then the people died . Everyone died , because those that did not perish from boils or fever or dehydration , turning blue-black and sinking flat from hopelessness , were then killed by outsiders afraid of contamination . We argued the matter and concluded miserably . It might be the plague . It might not be . And I note here that we were never to be sure . What was crucial then was that if it was out there , it was at the seaports where they  --  the beasties , the outcasts , the exiles , the self-named damned  --  crowded and scratched for food in competition with the chief predator of human detritus , the rat , the rat that carried the flea that carried the bacterium that was the plague . Bubonic to pneumonic or septicemic , I know the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not then ; plague was plague , horrible and sure , the end result of a breakdown in civilization , what Grandfather called the darkness . If it was out there , it was Otter Ransom 's bitter opinion , it would be only time and accident until it reached South Georgia . The leadership could not keep Germanicus 's discovery secret . Precaution and panic at the rumor of plague damaged the life of the island over the following year . The South Georgians had endured defeat , massacre , starvation , increasingly brutal winters as the ice pack seemed to creep north each year , even the cholera that drove the Volunteers from Port Stanley . The plague was profoundly different for them . It was an antediluvian foe , merciless , sudden . It was also a biblical curse . The South Georgians were a seafaring people , enjoying the bounty of and the crash of the weather and sea , a volatile mixture of God-fearing stoics and blasphemous doubters . They did know their Bible . They were at elemental extremes . The plague , the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Lazarus 's talk of the results of political tyranny in overcrowded lands torn apart by racial and religious and economic fears than it was to be explained simply and dread- fully as a judgment of Longfaeroe 's Jehovah . Even the doubters like the sealers , like Christmas Muir , who said they had no time to be Christian , were touched by the shadow of plague . There was a terror and completeness to it that they could not block out with their hard-mindedness . The Patties they could fight with blood . The cholera they could fight with sanitation . The cold they could fight with expertise . The starvation they could fight with rationing and summer dashes to Africa for grain , vegetables , fruit . But the plague , the rumor of plague , it rocked them . They knew it could be fought , but it was in their minds long before it could have been in their bodies , and there it wrecked more havoc to reason than it might ever have done to their health , there it made the defiant feel doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cruel decisions . I am not saying they were the toughest people who ever gripped the earth or sailed the seas , but they were heirs of that lot , and it was not enough . South Georgia is a **31;204;TOOLONG aquamarine rock , mountainous , heath-mantled , treeless , wind-scourged , battered by the stone-gray seas of what the sealers called the " filthy fifties . " This might sound desolate . It is , but also astonishing , haunting  --  misty blue peaks capped year-long with snow , naked heath laced with green fingers of fresh water . It is never more than ten miles wide except at its fat southern end , Cape Disappointment . It lies in a sailing arc between Cape Horn , a thousand miles upwind , and the Cape of Good Hope , twenty-five hundred miles downwind . In summer , it is gale-tossed , drenched , humid , at once sun-touched and cloud-tipped . In winter , it is deadly cold , dark gray , usually several hundred miles beyond the limit of the pack ice . In spring and fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing of bergy bits and , in the spring , an occasional passing of an enormous ice island calved from the Antarctic ice shelf . At least that was the case for my first five years there . South Georgia 's weather is usually determined by the fact that it sits atop the Scotia Ridge that surrounds the Scotia Sea , a bottomless , ice-clogged cauldron suited for whales and storms and little else . As Christmas Muir said , it is the sort of sea one could understand God granting the Scots .  | The spine of South Georgia is a sharp-peaked hornstone mountain range cut intermittently by craggy ravines pitted with caves through which the wind rushes year-long . That island could sing ; it could also scream . The main settlement , Grytviken , was on the lee shore , on the vast Cumberland Bay , and consisted of stone and sod and imported wood-built houses tumbled atop each other , a smooth plateau that was the marketplace , several wharfs and many warehouses surrounding the sprawling whaling factory that was the primary industry of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from the Second World War . Grytviken grew quickly and out of proportion after the defeat in the Falklands brought several thousand exiles to the island . The new town was renamed Gaunttown for the dead Luff Gaunt Senior , who had been the patriarch of the island . It was surrounded with gunposts and a series of watchtowers on the cliffsides . The Frazer camp was south of Gaunttown , and up . My shepherd 's hut was a few miles farther along a trail , in a natural amphitheater opening to the buffeted mountains of the western shoreline . The other settlements were on the southern shore at Cape Disappointment , mostly sour fisherman and old whalers and sealers , and on the northeastern shore , Shagrock , where Orlando the Black commanded a small group of sealers and evacuees from the Falklands . After the rumor of plague , the leadership divided the island into precincts , arranging them according to priority for defense and for carrying on fishing and shepherding . All able-bodied men and boys were conscripted Volunteers . After my baptism , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer in the Volunteers , as supposedly befitted my status as a Frazer orphan , as Longfaeroe 's Davidic candidate , as Abigail 's lover , and especially as what they called " the hero of the Presbyterian church . " I was assigned responsibility for a part of the southwestern shore , an important area because if any plague ships were coming , they would likely ride the westerlies from South America . Again , I do not want this to sound like grand militarism . The Volunteers and Falkland Irregulars in exile never numbered more than several hundred men and boys , committed to defend an island of two thousand mostly uninhabitable square miles from all sides , from nature .  | It should be without excuse that I report that the leadership determined to stop any group wanting to land on South Georgia henceforth . There are excuses , however , worthy of my attention . The most , profound might be that survivors , as we all were on South Georgia , are forever condemned by the fate that has permitted them to survive . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I was out of my hut and down to mix with the South Georgians , what had happened out there in the Atlantic since I had fallen sick . The so-called fleet of the damned had grown apace for a few years ; the beasties had come to South Georgia as they had to the Falklands , not in great numbers , because the Atlantic was vast and violent and the African ports were downwind . What beasties that had made it were either dead soon after or were taken into Gaunttown , some at Shagrock , a few at Cape Disappointment . Then , without explanation , the fleet had disappeared in our part of the ocean . The news we could get on the radio ( a most unreliable machine that far at sea ) mentioned a " refugee crisis , " said that potent councils of nations were struggling to solve the dilemma . A British warship called at Gaunttown my second summer on the island . The captain explained little , said he was on a " fact-finding mission " for special commissions established in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using his slang purposely , to demonstrate that whatever was going on out there was treated like a secret by the very people , in Europe and the Americas , who should have known most . We on South Georgia , without resources , seemed to know more than they did . The British captain had not challenged Elephant Frazer when he had introduced himself as governor-general of South Georgia ( before the war there had been only one governor-general for the whole of the Dependencies , based in Port Stanley ) , and had introduced Simon Brackenbury , a fierce Pattie-hater , as the governorgeneral of the Falklands government-in-exile . The commander of the Volunteers , a hard , devious , and enigmatic man named Gordon Hospidar whom everyone called " the Hospidar , " made demands on the captain 's stores and armory , and was obliged without comment . The captain acted as if he despised his compassionless task , hated what his government had made him , an emissary to charnel houses . The captain said he could do nothing to help the Falklander evacuees , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia . The message was clear : South Georgia was on its own . The captain did make one angry remark that became the focus of bitter jesting on the island . The captain said , promising to return , which he did not , " There 's been no war . There 's been one bloody shuffle . " That is descriptive of what the leadership on South Georgia inaugurated after the rumor of plague , during my fifth winter there . From the defeat to the visit of the British captain , they had nursed thoughts of revenge on the Patties , plotted possible attacks on Port Stanley ; from the captain 's visit to the rumor of plague , they had transformed the island into a fortress against anarchy ; after Germanicus 's return , they again transformed the island , this time from fortress to bloody shuffle . They thought like losers , acted accordingly . Reason gave way to meanspiritedness and worse . There were vicious arguments , food-hoardings , suicides , a sharp increase in the death of the old and the very young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore of the community as psalm singer . There were several other pastors in Gaunttown , mostly Falklander evacuees ; Longfaeroe was their master . They combined to preach sermons that supported a hardening of everyone 's heart . The chief controversy , what began the collapse of the nascent goodwill that had seen South Georgia through its deprivations , came not from the outside , not from plague or Patties or British suzerainty , but from inside . It concerned the thousand-odd beasties who had been given shelter before and after the defeat at Port Stanley , mostly as subsistence workers , as outright wards of the South Georgians . They were three quarters from South America , the remainder from Africa , the Falklands , a few families off a freighter that had originated in Italy . With the reorganization in fear of plague ships , the Volunteer command recommended to the governor-general , Elephant Frazer , that the beasties be corralled into a single camp , in a ravine just outside Gaunttown . The camp was built that fall ; the beasties were moved into it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a curfew , sharp rationing . The men and boys were conscripted into work gangs to help build watchposts along the western shore and to seal the passes that ran through the center of the island , west to east . The women and girls were forced to work in the whaling  | factory that supplied the island 's lighting and heating needs . A few were allowed to sail with the small whaling fleet left to us . In all , it was slavery . Longfaeroe dared to call it " Christian communism . " I should mention that no one on South Georgia was living much better than the beasties in the camp that winter ; many of the Volunteer outriders and those at Shagrock suffered worse . Still , it was abject cruelty toward those sad , helpless , lost people . I should explain that over the years since the defeat , there had been tentative and short-lived opposition to various maneuvers by the Volunteers , in concert with Elephant Frazer , as South Georgia had moved closer to a military dictatorship . What kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the homogeneity of ' the island  --  cousins upon cousins upon in-laws  --  disposed people toward cooperation . The detention and enslavement of the beasties was overmuch . Lazarus , who had by then become schoolmaster , and had often before criticized Elephant Frazer and the Volunteers for their tactics , led the opposition to the treatment of the beasties , what he called martial lawlessness . He recruited sympathy among his teachers , among people who had intermarried with beastie families , and from the best-educated people in the beastie camp , notably the Zulemas . Soon enough , Lazarus was denouncing Longfaeroe as a " hypocritical scold , " the Volunteers as " secret police , " and Elephant Frazer as " our despot . " Lazarus made his worst attacks in the Gaunttown Assembly , a powerless body that was meant mostly as a place to air grievances against neighbors and that had no authority to challenge or direct the governor-general . Lazarus was a good public speaker , played on jealousies between the families , got increasingly larger turnouts as he slandered Elephant Frazer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new patriarch of the Gaunts , Luff Gaunt III , called Trip Gaunt , that he should control his inlaw , since Lazarus had married a Gaunt widow , Violante . Trip Gaunt had no sympathy with Lazarus , but coveted Elephant Frazer 's position  --  which would have been Luff Gaunt 's if he had lived  --  and so took advantage . The Gaunts appeared to break with the Frazers , which in South Georgia terms was as if the right hand had denounced the left hand . They jointly owned the sealing schooner King James , and there was talk that spring of a seizure  | of the ship by the Gaunts when Germanicus returned from fishing and a run to Africa for supplies . Gaunttown felt obliged to choose between Frazer authority and Gaunt pride . The Falklander exiles under Simon Brackenbury stood against all beasties and with those extremists who thought the camp was coddling the beasties . Lazarus attacked the more , made a speech at the Assembly Hall ( the old Society of Friends ' Meeting House ) in which he accused the Volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tyrannize South Georgia further . " Where is this dread disease ? " Lazarus asked . ( I was not present , off in my precinct building watchtowers . Abigail , who told me about it later , stood beside Lazarus throughout , as did Germanicus 's promised , Jane Gaunt . ) He continued , " Has anyone proved it ? Has there been a word on the radio ? Is it true ? The Volunteers send a ship to the Falklands , at the risk of it and its men , in order to placate the Brackenburys and their hatemongers , and then tell us there is plague . What proof do they offer ? None ! Friends , friends , there is a plague . I admit it . It is the disease in their lawlessness . They imprison innocent men and women and call it proper . They take children from their homes and make them fill sandbags . That is the sickness ! Where is this disease ? Not in us . In them ! And what is it ? Not plague out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plague is tyranny ! " Within the week , there was a knife fight on the quays below the High Street , between a Gaunt boy and one of the beastie children who , as an orphan like me , had been taken in by the Frazers . The Gaunt boy lost an eye , the Frazer child was badly wounded in the stomach . The Frazer child had been one of the best young students at the school , a prodigy at mathematics , and that he would get involved in violence was telling enough of the stress the island felt . It became much worse when one of Longfaeroe 's presbyters , a sly crank named Fergus Moog , declared at Sunday service that the real knife-wielder was Lazarus , whom he called a " copperheaded snake . " Events tumbled after that . Jane Gaunt , one of Lazarus 's teachers , was accused of poisoning the minds of the youngest children against the Volunteers . And when Jane called at the hospital to tutor the two wounded children , she was blocked at the door by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the  | whaling factory . She tried to force her entrance , and was stoned . Those blows left worse than physical scars . When Germanicus returned from Africa to find Jane still convalescing from her wounds , he lost his temper . He denounced Frazers and Gaunts alike . Out of character , he drank too much one night in the sealer tavern , NIGHT SUN , and challenged his father 's reluctance to heed the counsel of the Gaunttown Assembly , said his father was afraid of Lazarus as he had never been afraid of the Patties . Germanicus 's words flashed through the Volunteers , because he was considered the champion of the young officers , about forty of us altogether . It was recalled that Lazarus had once said that the Volunteers were no better than the Patties . The question was asked , did Germanicus now agree ? The next day , Germanicus was humiliated by what he had done , rashly , in revenge for Jane 's stoning , and realized that he had invited on himself the dilemma of either weakening the Volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions like splinters . In trying to correct his error , he stumbled further , calling for an emergency meeting of the Assembly ( scheduled previously only twice a season ) to air the doubts . The meeting was blocked at the last moment by the Hospidar , commander of the Volunteers , who said it was an invitation to sedition . The Hospidar acted cleverly , knowing his intervention smeared Germanicus 's patriotism . This was meant as an affront to all the young officers as well as to the Frazers and , through Jane Gaunt , to the Gaunts . There was talk of a duel , also talks of a court-martial , also mention of a more outrageous solution ? posting Germanicus to Cape Disappointment to guard the hermits . Germanicus was shamed , would not reach to cover himself , apologized to his father and to the Hospidar publicly , offered to resign his commission . The Hospidar saw his victory , was generous in conquest , said Germanicus 's contrition was not sufficient but that Germanicus 's arms were necessary , as were all the loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon Brackenbury was there that day , and added that he could promise that none of his people would ever question Elephant Frazer and the Volunteers while the Falklands remained unavenged . The Hospidar and Brackenbury thus combined to satisfy no one , to advance their  | own cause . The factions were left bitter , and were well armed . They might have been moved right then to assassination if not for the shock of a real crime against the island . In December  --  early summer  --  someone set fire to the school . I recall the incident clearly because I was at dinner with Abigail in my hut , had gone out for water , when I spied the glow over the ridge . Abigail had left Sam with the Frazer women to come up to celebrate my twenty-seventh birthday . She explained the sparks of the feud as we watched the fire grow quickly in the wind . It was pathetic ; South Georgia had so little , and then it had no school . I realize this has become much detail . I suppose I record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did spend almost six years there  --  though I can recall only that last year with acuity ? and also as a way of feeling close again to people whom I did love , who did love me . They were not the most generous people , quick to anger , unforgiving , hateful of outsiders , especially if their skin color or religion or ways were not theirs . I am sure Lazarus 's words would have been considered wise if he had not looked like the Patties , and I do wonder if Lazarus would have been more patient if he had not concluded too easily that his enemies were bigots instead of frightened husbands and wives . Overall , however , the South Georgians were more fair-minded than not  --  they had taken me and mine and a thousand beasties in  --  and struggled to remain sanguine and good-natured , considering how cruel nature was to them . More , I have emphasized here their fears and weaknesses and feuding , have not done justice to their decency . I am writing of an island a thousand leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the permanent ice shelf , where there is nothing but wracking work and savage sea . It is natural then that they moved toward savagery to settle their disputes . I also admit that I might have jumbled the details leading up to the school fire ; and I have left out or forgotten much of consequence , such as the turns of the Lindfirs , the Harrahs , the Roses , the Moogs , the Johansens , and the beastie family who ruled the camp , the Zulemas . " I'he enslavement , the stoning , the suicides , the stillbirths , a theft from the Volunteers ' fort at the lighthouse on the inlet point that I have not noted , and the Hospidar 's defamation of Germanicus are a sad chronology . But there were even drearier details that I  | only heard rumor of , and there was one more sadness ( which I shall soon record ) that reached back before the defeat to the root of the vulnerability of the South Georgians . They were poor people , whale-poachers , high-risk sealers , ill-equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this work my disgust for what I call the Age of Exile , the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century ; however , I register that the South Georgians were the result of an earlier age 's willingness to degrade and drive out and abandon men and women . One can not believe that the Scots and Irish and Norse people who made up the families on South Georgia had elected to risk the Atlantic Ocean and to scratch a life on hornstone crags . They had survived there without anyone 's help , without even the sinister charity that I identify as the source of the so-called fleet of the damned . They asked no favors , gave no favors , fought and endured and fought . South Georgia was their home , and I think they knew it was not a refuge , nor sanctuary , nor peace . It was a chance , and they took it for that . The women of South Georgia were far more crucial to the struggle I recount than I have acknowledged : Abigail and Jane Gaunt , Violante Furore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many more . They organized , fed , gave birth , made peace , stood as solid as the cliffs . It was the women who held up better than the men in those days . They seemed to know that the war , the British abandonment , the plague , were fleeting threats , yet the loss of the school was a profound emergency . They responded in unison , outraged at their men for posturing while the children were deprived . There were so many suspects for the arson , it was an easy conclusion that everyone was guilty . Dolly Frazer pulled Elephant Frazer 's beard , told him to act , and soon , or he could govern everything without a bed to sleep in . The Gaunt women and Rose women , and the Hospidar 's sister , Victoria , followed suit . The Volunteers were left to complain in their cups . It was not funny . The weapon was spite , and the women used it . A new opinion was advanced that the sort of government that could fight a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government that could tend its homes . In a subdued yet serious way , revolution was in the wind . The shock of the fire brought Germanicus to my hut soon after , Christmas  | week , and with him Jane Gaunt and Otter Ransom . Abigail and Wild Drumrul were already with me . It was a damp night , a big storm coming from the west , and we gathered around my hearth fire eating mutton , very sad , yet in our way young and hopeful . " Lazarus says we should force an election for a president of the Assembly , " said Abigail . " I agree . We have a part . We must have a say . Lazarus says there should be a constitution , and a popular vote . " " So Lazarus says , " said Germanicus . " My dad can not . " " It wo n't be for governor-general , " said Abigail . " For a president to speak for us wee folk . Elephant Frazer speaks for the elders . My dad speaks for the parsons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Volunteers . Brackenbury , he speaks for the Falklanders . And the beasties , Toro Zulema says their part . Who speaks for me and Jane and the like ? " " Begod no , woman , " said Germanicus . " Beasties and Patties ai n't the problem now . Volunteers ! The Hospidar has our sworn loyalty . I 'd follow him to Davy Jones . If Dad tried to form a government of presidents and the like , the Hospidar 'd say rebellion ' and take over . Yerr talk be daft . " " So now we 're shy of the Hospidar ? " said Jane Gaunt , a rosy , round woman of nineteen , plucky , sharp , competitive of Germanicus , proud . " Not that , Janey , " said Germanicus , who I thought had a good point . " Lazarus 'd be sure to be elected president right soon . He 'd speak for himself all right , and against the Hospidar and Brackenbury . Dad 'd be caught like a hand in a vice . " Jane suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Germanicus puffed up , did not reply . It was true that he had come to distrust Lazarus as I had once , for his arrogance , his high-handed intellectualism . It was also accurate that if there was an election , Lazarus would win easily ; the mothers would vote for him in a block . He was their schoolmaster , and charismatic , and smart , perhaps the only man on the island who cared to show that he loved children . " What if ' Lazarus stepped aside ? " said Otter Ransom to me in Swedish . He was hesitant to participate , not just because of his poor English , but also because Germanicus was his captain and he was an appreciative and loyal seaman . I encouraged him to talk  | in English , helped him with his words and idioms . He told them of Sweden , when the King 's government had stepped aside in favor of churchmen who spoke for the common people . He inadvertently scrambled facts , made Grandfather 's revolution seem more sensible than it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years my senior , and at one time a hunted outlaw in Sweden , remembered the crisis there . He made it seem logical , just , saving . Abigail listened and shook her head , said that Lazarus would not stand by quietly . " They burned his school , " she added . " Oh , aye , his school now ? A pity he 's quarrelsome in his inks and books , " said Germanicus . " I done wrong to speak against Dad , but not the half of what Lazarus done to stir up the folk . He 's full of himself for a stranger here among those that feed him . Burned his school , did we ? Our school , I think , and what does Lazarus say to that ? Ten years I was in that school , and it 'd be there still but for Lazarus 's tongue . " " Lazarus does n't matter , does he , because he 's no Frazer ? " said Jane Gaunt . " Or is it because he 's married a Gaunt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two of them separated . " Why would he step aside ? " Abigail asked Otter Ransom . " In the North , " began Otter Ransom , " there is a story of an assembly that met once a year , the beginning of summer , where the clans met for their talk and grievances . It had priests , like churchmen , who spoke for the peace of the common people . Grim Fiddle knows . " I explained that what Otter Ransom was recalling was the Althing , the legislative and judicial assembly for medieval Iceland . I talked slowly , because it was my discovery , listening to my closest friends on South Georgia , that they were better at fighting than at thinking about their fight . I knew myself a weak intellectual in comparison to Lazarus , but I saw then that what little I had absorbed from listening to Israel and Peregrine argue politics , and reading Charity Bentham 's works , and studying Longfaeroe 's notions about kingship and just government in the books of Samuel , made me their master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did know the difference between authority and tyranny . Therefore I described the Althing carefully , telling them  | it was a once-a-year assembly meant to adjudicate feuds among families . Thirty-nine priests presided over the Althing , men drawn from the major families from early in Iceland 's history and whose offices then became hereditary . The priests were considered to be above bribery and blood influence . It was as close to democracy as the medieval North ever came , and I think it fair to say that the Althing was no less broad-minded than the much celebrated Greek assemblies that were responsible for words like democracy , despotism . I told them the Althing was created because Iceland was a refuge for outcasts from the North Sea kingdoms , men who hated kingship yet had to agree on how to live in harmony . I concluded , " The decisions of the Althing were final . Any man who dissented was banished . And that was the Althing 's worst punishment for a crime  --  exile . Since Iceland was already an outlaw haven , exile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's your Skallagrim Strider , is n't it ? " said Abigail . " From what you say , " said Jane , " Lazarus 'd be wrong for the presidency , because he 's married a Gaunt . We need someone from outside the big families , but who could please the families and the Volunteers and Reverend Longfaeroe and Lazarus , also the Zulemas , the beasties . The Hospidar would n't dare against such a president . He 'd be free of all , including Elephant Frazer . A people 's spokesman . " " Lazarus 's tongue , that be , " said Germanicus . " It 's fine learning . It 'd do some no harm , " said Jane . " I have my ways , " said Germanicus . " The Frazers have their ways , " said Jane . " No use to us if there 's a plague coming , or more beasties . Lazarus says a tyranny has less chance than an oligarchy , and an oligarchy less chance than a democracy . We need a constitutional assembly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's a liar ! " We all talked at once , trying to calm Germanicus , trying to make peace between those two stubborn lovers . Jane loved Germanicus  --  who did not ? ? yet she also loved learning and was also a Gaunt . She would not let Germanicus 's temper distract her summary . " If we can propose a candidate to unite the families , a union candidate , " said Jane , " your dad would see the sense of an election . " I'llen we can get us a constitution . Lazarus says a government of men is lawless , a government of law is a rock . "  | " What 're you saying , girl ? " said Abigail hesitantly . " You 'd be a fine candidate , Abbie , " said Jane . " I 'm a Longfaeroe and a Frazer and mother of a bastard , " said Abigail . For their own reasons , Jane and Abigail laughed . " There be a man , " said Germanicus heavily . " No ! Hold your tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiddle , " said Jane . I had not thought Wild Drumrul understood what was said , but he then stood up and said in English , " In the name of Allah the Compassionate , the Merciful , Grim Fiddle ! " I knew it the preface to his Moslem prayers , a way of announcing the profound . He put his hands on my shoulders , met me eye to eye . It made me recall the promise I had made to his dead brother , Dede Gone , in Vexbeggar . How had I been my brothers ' keeper ? Goggle-Eye was dead at Port Praia . Little Dede Gone was dead trying to get Black Crane back to me . Wild Drumrul was on an island that was spiritually farther from his heritage than it was physically . And he was still game , a seaman on King James , a Volunteer for people he barely understood . What right did I have for further exemption from struggle because I was orphaned , was sad , was ashamed for my berserker nature ? What did Wild Drumrul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked for My help . I made a rambling attempt to protest their scheme . I could hear myself talk  --  a sign , Israel once said , that a man does not believe himself . I was not wise ; I was healthy . I was not well-spoken ; I could speak my heart . I was not humble ; I knew some of my limits . I was not a good Christian ; I loved and knew love . I was unqualified for anyone 's trust ; I was a young , earnest man who respected the truth . And now they called me to be a problem-solver by being a truth-teller . It did please me , my vanity and my courage . I imagined that it would have pleased Peregrine , and Grandfather . I imagined that Skallagrim Strider too had felt shame for his life wasted on his own concerns yet had met the call of his men when they were banished from Iceland forever . I watched Abigail as I debated my qualifications with Germanicus and Jane . Abigail 's eyes were wet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gathered her face and their words and felt stronger . To them I was an idea .  | They carried the idea of Grim Fiddle , peacemaker , union candidate , back to Gaunttown , to Elephant Frazer and the Hospidar , to Lazarus and the Zulemas , most importantly to Dolly Frazer , Violante Furore , Frances Gaunt , Amanda Rose , Beatrice Harrah , Victoria Hospidar , and Bonnie Moog . Longfaeroe took up the idea as if it were a gift from Jehovah . The debate was quick , too quick for it to have been constructive , more as if conciliation were desired , not compromise . On the first Sunday in the new year , 2001 , the first Sunday in a new century and new millennium Longfaeroe was happy to proclaim , Longfaeroe preached and sang on the rise of David from the flocks of Bethlehem to the throne of the Hebrews , a sermon  --  I was told , because Lazarus advised me to stay clear of the campaigning  --  that left the women of Gaunttown in tears and the men scarlet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutton supper in my hut had brought together the noblest spirits on South Georgia , a Frazer and Gaunt and Longfaeroe and beastie and outlaw , calling to Jehovah for Guidance . Jehovah had sent a message , in that storm that broke over my hut as we ate and talked : Grim Fiddle was South Georgia 's found hope . Did they call me a savior ? Some did . Others said , usurper . The debate flowed and ebbed through the summer . The original issue of the beasties enslaved seemed forgotten . Lazarus said the issue became : devotion with or without representation ? Concessions were required and made by all sides . The assumed verdict was that no popular vote for the president of the Gaunttown Assembly would be permitted ; instead , the president would be chosen by a ballot of the elders of the families . Also , the president would be the convener of and spokesman for the Gaunttown Assembly , nothing more , and the Assembly 's power would remain undefined pending further debate . The hopes for a constitution and popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables of the taverns . The South Georgians were dominated by Scots Presbyterians , a people who suspect kingship but who are equally distrustful of permitting commoners just everyman  --  a voice in matters of property and blood-kin authority . Lazarus counseled himself and the young people to remain patient . He explained to me that South Georgia fascinated him as a political phenomenon where , because  | of its isolation physically and now economically , time had seemingly stopped , or regressed , to something very close to what America had been at its birth as a nation . Liberty was the desire , to be fought for at any cost ; however , and paradoxically , that liberty was seen to be as threatened by universal suffrage as it was by despotism . The South Georgians wanted to live free , yet knew they must have some government , and so they concluded the less government they had , the better they would be . Lazarus concluded they were immature , and smiled in that expectant , selfconfident , secretive way of his . He accepted , in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified election of a constrained president of an ambiguously defined Assembly . Then he immediately set about campaigning for what he called a true republic for South Georgia  --  written laws , universal suffrage , elected officials , coexistent executive , legislative , judicial branches of government  --  which he said he would " harvest " ( he also used the word forge ) as soon as he had me , as the president , to convene the Gaunttown Assembly not only as a " people 's voice " but also as a " constitutional assembly . " Lazarus saw his challenge as I did not , and prepared himself , with book learning and rhetoric , for the battle ahead . Abigail came by herself to tell me the results of the elders ' vote . It was late summer , coolish , misty . The election was not unanimous . The Hospidar 's candidate , Christian Rose , and the Gaunt 's candidate , Kevin Gaunt , took more than half the vote together . I was president by plurality , not majority , a result that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that I was free of one flock , woolly heads , and promised to another kind , woolly-headed , hardheaded ; I was also relieved of my duties as a Volunteer , required to move into the upstairs rooms of the Assembly Hall . Abigail was heartsick . She stayed by the door as she told me how her father had hugged her after the vote , had thanked her for helping me gain my " divine role . " She said it was the first her father had touched her since childhood . That was not the cause of her melancholy . Lazarus had told her she should be careful with me for a while , lest the other factions use a charge of profligacy against me , and she exaggerated his advice . She said we must  | stop our affair , that she had come to say good-bye . I knew she was testing my devotion . " You belong to them , " she said . " Lazarus says you 're changed . You 're the only elected official on the island . You 're no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dad , my man . They did this to Samson . They made him their bloody captain , and he was changed too . Even if he 'd come back to me , I 'd lost him to them . Lord forgive me , I loved you- before when you were a bonnie sad boy , and I love you still . I ca n't help you do this thing . I mark them . They 've taken you from me . I ca n't save you no more . Save yourself . " " What can happen ? " I protested . " Lazarus says I 'm a figurehead . " " Like the bow of a ship , what they shoot at , " she said . " Abbie , I 'm not Samson , " I tried , softly , " not David either . " I meant it to lighten her heart . It was our joke . She smiled , but if ever there was a smile of unhappiness , that was it . She said , " Oh , it 's daft we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , save yourself . " And then she came over and kissed me , and took me . I was theirs , she said ; she took me as hers . I can not sharply recall her scent , or her touch ; I can still hear her cry in passion . She was loud . I liked that . Afterward , I tried to convince her our lives would improve , that as soon as the troubles passed , we could live together , could marry , give her sons and our Sam a proper home . I tried to persuade her with my wishes , and Lazarus 's ideas , and Germanicus 's strength . I tried to prove to her we were not changed , just wiser . She said she wanted to believe me , said she was afraid to marry another to lose . She put her head on my breast , did not weep . I realized then , embracing sweet , sturdy , haunted Abigail , that we were changed , that I was changed . In her eyes , I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow , and pulled her closer to protect her from her doubts . In the weeks that followed , I continued my seduction of Abigail even as my new status took me from her . As the fall closed on us , however , all my eager words , all our high dreams , all that we as free men and women could do , were undone by a natural catastrophe .  | I have mentioned the fury of the Scotia Sea , raked by the westerlies and churned by the Falkland Current , what the sealers said was the home of the mothers of freak waves , as massive as rolling mountains , frequently dwarfing even that behemoth that tossed Angel of Death mid-Atlantic and more frequently draped in a dense fog that smeared the boundary between sea and sky . The sealers told another story of the Scotia Sea , one that overshadowed the dread of those saltwater ranges . They told of the thirteen consecutive winters when the ice pack that spread each winter from the Antarctic actually pushed out to wrap South Georgia in a howling white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century , when only whalers and sealers sailed farther south than the fifty-fifth parallel , when only crazed sealers dared cross the sixtieth parallel for the wealth of the rookeries on the South Orkneys and South Shetlands . It was a broad account , sealer talk , what Christmas Muir told me was " banker 's bait , " meaning it was likely more an excuse for poor catches  --  passed on to the banking houses that funded the sealing expedition  --  than it was reliable oceanology . The notion that the Weddell Sea , which cups Antarctica from Queen Maud Land to Graham Land , could extend its ice sheet more than seven hundred miles beyond the Antarctic circle is fantastic . I watched it happen May and June of my sixth year on South Georgia . Each clear morning , one in four that time of year , I would leave my rooms in the Assembly Hall and climb to the high heath to stand transfixed as the southeastern horizon brightened with what is called an ice blink . The vanguard of the pack approached in a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military operation . Tabular icebergs calved from Antarctica 's permanent ice sheet preceded the pack like shock troops , some a mile long and a few hundred yards wide , turning over suddenly as the tide tossed them , others tens of miles long and wide , drifting ice islands several hundred feet high , craggy , multicolored . The sea was also laced  | with bergy bits broken from the ice islands and with brash ice , sheets of ice independent of the main pack . The pack itself advanced both under the glare of the ice blink and under the astounding optical phenomenon of mirages of ice islands projected upside down against the steel-blue sky . At times , it could look as if a monstrous gray mouth yawned toward South Georgia , jagged white teeth of ice islands below and above  --  shimmering , bloodred at sunset , angry . Christmas Muir and Peggs and Wild Drumrul would climb up with me . Peggs , a man who , no braggart , could reminisce about the seven seas of the world and the ice of both poles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all this time , I still take satisfaction in knowing the natural process that has entombed me and mine . Sea water freezes at twenty-eight and a half degrees Fahrenheit . He was not precise about the science , and from what I recall , the air temperature is independent of the temperature at sea level . First , frazil ice forms on the water , like slush with oily water atop . Then , as the temperature drops with the wind and current , the frazil ice transforms into a sludgy layer called grease ice . Finally , the temperature plunging , independent sheets , called pancake ice , congeal into new ice that , when it thickens to nine feet , loses its salt content and bobs free of the water . This new ice crumbles and stratifies as the sea beneath , or a storm above , throws one floe against another , a process called hummocking or , in the case of one floe thrusting over another , rafting . Hummocking and rafting combine new ice into ragged , heaving walls that can grow to barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles of a tireless crystal army . I enjoy how placid the process can seem . To watch it the first time was awful . I felt as if the sea were dying , all life slowing to an omnipresent nothingness . As the pack gathers strength , cooling the air temperature before it , it sends out new ice like claws that bend back into the pack , then dart out again to grab new sea or to anchor onto the ice islands that serve as advance guard . The pack was ever moving , ever violent . It had no plan , rather it was a condition ; yet because the pack grew hourly , it seemed sublimely alive . It was actually the antithesis of life . Have I communicated the noise ? South Georgia was wind and rain , the sea smashing t he cliffs , seafoam arching over the crags ,  | elemental chaos building to endless howls . That same ceaseless wind rushing across the ice pack was transformed into an omnipresent scream . The pack rippled with the tides , which , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack shivering as a wave ran beneath the mass . Pressure ridges formed when one gigantic floe crushed against another , huge pieces of ice , whole bergs , fired into the air like cannon salvos . The ice islands were continually disintegrating in the sun 's heat , and they whined as they twisted against themselves , roaring as a crack ran lengthwise , sludgy rivers cascading from their faces . Whenever the open sea broke through the field , it would catch up brash ice and throw it against the ice fronts with rattling , knocking , scratching sounds . And the fast ice , that which attaches to land masses , would rub up against South Georgia and the outlying rocks , screeching when the pack heaved north , ever north , to replace the vanguard melted off in the warm currents of the horse latitudes . The pack swept over South Georgia . I am not sure if it was more frightening to sit on the ridge with the sea covered in a fog and listen to the pack rumble and whine , or to stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , a hundred hundred tongues of ice licking the gray waves . The contrasts were hypnotizing , and I came to anticipate them : one noon , the sun pushing through in the low northeastern sky like torchlight , not warm but reassuringly there , the pack would be solid to the west , but to the east there would be open sea pocked with wave crests , dotted with brash ice , some giant bergs bashing one another . The next day the pack would be everywhere , flat , glistening , windscourged , ice islands in the sky ; then again in several hours the floes would part to shape a seamlike channel , the sea breaking through to shape a lake in the ice , perhaps a storm rolling black clouds and fog over the field . For beneath the pack was the cauldron of the Scotia Sea , thrusting untold billions of tons of water up against the ice . " It 's beauty to me , " said Christmas Muir . " I been icebound more'n once out there . Peggs , he walked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a boat . Out there , man forgets things . Until she moves on ye , or she squeezes yerr ship to splinters . And them killers come sniffin ' , those pig eyes looks at ye for supper . " Wild Drumrul asked , what killers ? Christmas Muir laughed ,  | pleased that he had scared us , and told of the killer whales , thirty feet long , really large dolphins , that preyed in packs upon anything living or dead above or beneath the ice pack ; that was in the Antarctic Circle , he said , and need not worry us on South Georgia . Wild Drumrul spoke my mind , asking , what was it like on the pack ? Christmas Muir started to joke , let Peggs answer soberly , " It makes a man want to sit down and quit . Jes ' quit . " The pack had the same effect on South Georgia . The people of Gaunttown withdrew inside themselves . The only warmth seemed one 's own heart , but then , even the pulse rate slows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming in the blood . It had been dreary before ; with the pack sealing us from open water , it became morbid . By the middle of July , winter upon us , the siege was complete , a white desert for at least one hundred miles to the northwest , perhaps fifty to the northeast . The ships in Cumberland Bay were in continual jeopardy from the ice islands that spun by . If one of them had turned with the current and loomed down on Gaunttown , it could have crushed everything afloat , perhaps more . One ice island , fifty miles long and five wide , did ram the windward shore about forty miles north of Gaunttown , sending rumbles through the ridge each time the current heaved it up against the underwater rocks . It was fanciful to imagine , though there were those that did , a fleet of those monsters closing on South Georgia , horn-tipped and ninety miles long , to gouge away our ark of hornstone . The melancholy of being icebound wore easiest on the sealers , like Christmas Muir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frazer ordered strict rationing , confiscated several private stockpiles , arrested and imprisoned some black marketeers , for fear that the pack would not fully recede with the next summer 's heat , might return for the next twelve years as in the sealers ' tale . That was not credible , neither were the black-ice islands that emerged from the pack in July . " I knew 'd it , I mostly did , " said Christmas Muir . " It 's that Satan 's Seat . I told ye , matey . Ye can still hear it growlin ' if ye got ears like mine , underwater like , them black giants , like pieces of Hell , I tell ye , and do n't forget that ram 's head . Him 's got notions , bad ' tins . "  | I accompanied Germanicus on a march north soon after , to inspect the fort that had been built to guard the main pass through the island , thirty miles northwest of Gaunttown . Germanicus regretted the excessive precautions the Volunteers demanded against the beasties , the plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . We camped off a humpbacked ridge west of the central mountain range , in a shepherd 's hut , that , because of the pass , gave us a good view to the southwest . On the first clear morning , we took a work break to have a look at the black ice , more soot-colored , really , streaked gray , black bergy bits broken off . We were too far from where they must have originated ? about one thousand miles  --  for them to have been starkly black against the white . " I do n't make much of that gab about that volcano , " said Germanicus . " The Southern Ocean be as full of wild talk as whales . I grew up with it . I remember as a wee boy hearin ' Dad tell Samson where Antarctica comes from . Dad said , once upon a time , long afore , before Jesus , there was a great kingdom at the South Pole . No ice blanket then , jes ' cold and grand . It was ruled by three kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with hairy elephants and black diamonds . The folk lived off the sea and worshiped Jehovah , like us . King Beach , loneliest of the three kings , loved an albatross and had a daughter with her . This princess were n't beautiful , nor clever , nor good . She wanted to live with ice birds , and she hated men , mostly , except when they made love to her . She called that flight . ' She taunted every young man she could because they could n't fly . She taunted special King Lunach 's son and King Maleteur 's son . Well , she also must have sported with them , because she had this child , a boy , soon enough . Her dad was shamed and sealed her up in a palace , a palace made of black diamonds and whalebones . He did n't know who 'd fathered his heir . He thought on his spite and decided to hold a banquet . He had the bairn cut up into meat for pies and fed them pies to the men he figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ate hearty and went out for a stroll along a glacier , as was their way with full guts . King Beach told them there what he 'd done . They were angry . It were n't because he 'd made them eat a bairn in pies . That was their custom in times of famine ,  | to eat the small and weak . They were angry because he suspected all of them when only one was guilty . They went on screamin ' at him , Mod , mod , the bleddy mon be mod . ' That were n't all of it . It happened that no one of them could admit to being the bairn 's father , since they 'd all been with the princess , flying and the like . They were disgusted with themselves . They got worked up and killed King Beach and offered themselves to the princess as her husband . They understood that the man she chose was the man guilty of causing all the fuss and must be killed . The princess cursed them for eatin ' her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spite and one day called them altogether and named them all as her husband to be . This was daft , and they laughed at her stupid revenge . The princess went back to her palace of black diamonds and white bones and called upon Jehovah to avenge her . Jehovah was angry at the misery these men had caused , and granted the princess 's prayer , though she 'd never prayed before . He destroyed all three kingdoms with fire and brimstone . With volcanoes , I expect . Jehovah covered the ruin with an ice sheet for eternity . Jehovah then thought on his judgment and what he 'd done , made a cold and grand kingdom into a frozen ruin , and he was sorry . He promised he would n't ever again send the fire and the ice to punish wickedness . He turned the men that was left into seals , the womenfolk into birds , the children into penguins , and the hairy elephants into whales . And that 's where Antarctica comes from . Dad said them elephant seals were the seafarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " I asked . Germanicus laughed , clapping his sides over and over , saying , " It be a sealer 's tale , Grim . I tell ye to show ye what to take from them sealers . On the ice , a man sees things . He thinks uncommon . That tale of that volcano , Satan 's Seat , it be a sealer passin ' time . " " But the black ice , " I said , " if there is a volcanic range , if it is melting the ice , that might explain the ice pack pushing out this far . " " Black ice , black plague , no bait to me . It be black hearts that wreck us . Them , they wo n't stop being feared of what happens . We must . Samson died , it happened . We lost the Falklands , it happened . The ice came , it happened .

Too much like a sealer 's tale . The ice happened . Not that I know what might be comin ' . It be wearin ' on Dad . The Hospidar be a rough one .

He says he wants to take the knife from the assassin , and the best way to do that is to make everyone become at the same time both the assassin and the assassinated . It 's a complicated business , about Sweden and America . " " Rich lands and warm ways , " said Germanicus . " This republic Lazarus promises , it 'll last as long as a man in that water , if ten bad men , aye , one weak man , takes charge . My dad be what 's between what meanness we got and killin ' . Lazarus has learning , I say , learning for rich lands , not here . One God , one land , one man , one way . " " I respect what you say , " I said . " The Bible 's way , " said Germanicus .

Nixon trusted the general and bided his time . When he tried for the general 's job years later , he was defeated , but just barely , by another soldier from the other side of the country . Nixon was bitter for his loss . He was also angry about things in America  --  a war in Asia , discrimination against the Negroes , their beasties , and other matters about money . Nixon said America was losing its greatness . The Americans laughed at him , told him he was old and tired . For reasons I do n't understand , Nixon waited many more years and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was old and tired , and did n't believe in anything but himself .

Nixon was hard , and full of vengeance . It made him weak . If he had trusted his own people , and trusted the laws of the Republic , I might not be here right now . " " Ye do n't trust my dad ? " said Germanicus , who did not evidence to me that he cared much for my story of Nixon the tyrant . Telling it had made me sad , thinking of Israel . I sighed . " I owe your dad everything .
