 | AFTER LEAVING DR . FURffiTO , Katie went to the east wing of the hospital for the transfusion . It was given to her in a curtained-off area near the emergency room . As she lay on top of a bed , her sleeve rolled back , the needle strapped in her arm , she tried to reconstruct her arrival at the hospital Monday night . She thought she remembered being in this mom , but she was n't sure . The doctor who had sewed the cut in her arm looked in . " Hi , I thought I saw you at the desk . I see Dr. Highley ordered another transfusion . I hope you 're looking into that low blood count . " " Yes . I 'm under Dr. Highley 's care . " " Fine . Let 's take a look at that arm . " He rebandaged it as she lay there . " Good job . Have to admit it myself . You wo n't have a scar to show your grandchildren . " " If I have any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I on this bed Monday night ? " " Yes , we had you in here after the X-rays . You do n't remember ' ? " " It 's all such a blur . " " You lost a lot of blood . You were in a pretty good state of shock . " " I see . " When the transfusion was finished , she remembered that Dr. Highley had told her not to drive for thirty minutes . She decided to go to the admitting office and fill out the necessary forms for an in-  | patient stay . Then she would n't have to bother with them Friday evening . When she left the hospital it was nearly six o'clock . She found herself automatically turning the car in the direction of Chapin River . Nonsense , she thought . You 're having dinner with Molly and Bill tomorrow night . Forget about dropping in tonight . The decision settled , she made a U-turn and drove to Palisades Parkway . She was getting hungry , and the thought of going home did not appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joys of solitude and then had finished the poem with the lines " But do not go home alone after five . / Let someone be waiting there " ? Well , she had learned to cope with loneliness , had taught herself to genuinely enjoy a quiet evening of reading with the stereo playing . The feeling of emptiness that came over her lately was something new . She passed the restaurant where she and Richard had eaten the night before and on impulse swung into the parking area . Tonight she 'd try the other specialty , the entrecote . Maybe in the warm , intimate , quiet restaurant she 'd be able to think . The proprietor recognized her and beamed with pleasure . " Good evening , madam . Dr. Carroll did not make a reservation , but I have a table near the fireplace . He is parking the car ? " She shook her head . " Just me tonight , I 'm afraid . " For an instant the man looked embarrsssed , but recovered quickly . " Then I suspect we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to a table near the one she had shared with Richard . Nodding at the suggestion of a glass of Burgundy , Katie leaned back and felt the same sense of unwinding she 'd experienced the night before . Now if she could just collect her thoughts , sort out the impressions that she 'd received talking to Dr. Highley and Dr. Fukhito about Vangie Lewis . Taking out her pad , she began to scan what she had jotted down during the interviews . Dr. Highley . She 'd expected him to explain or defend the fact that Vangie Lewis was obviously in serious trouble with her pregnancy . He had done exactly that , and what he told her was completely reasonable . He was going day by day to buy the baby time . The remarks he 'd made about Vangie 's reaction to the impending birth rang true . She 'd heard from Molly the story of Vangie 's hysterical reaction to a blister on the finger . What then ? What more did she want of Dr. Highley ? She thought of Dr. Wainwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of John . After John died , he 'd spoken to her , his face and voice filled with pain . " I want you to know , Mrs. DeMaio , we tried everything possible to save him . Nothing was left undone . But sometimes God takes it out of our hands . " Dr. Highley had expressed regret over Vangie 's death , but certainly not sorrow . But of course , he had to stay objective . She 'd heard Bill and Richard discussing the need to stay objective when you practice medicine . Otherwise you 'd constantly be torn in two and end up useless . Richard . Inadvertently her eyes slid over to the table where she 'd been with him . He 'd said , " We both know we could enjoy each other . " He was right . She did know it . Maybe that was why she usually felt unsettled with him , as though things could be taken out of her hands . Is it possible that it could happen twice in a lifetime ? From the very beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she and Richard were leaving Molly 's after that quick lunch yesterday , Molly had asked them both to dinner Thursday night  --  tomorrow . Molly said , " Liz and Jim Berkeley are coming over . She 's the one who thinks Dr. Highley is God . You two might be interested in talking with her . " Katie realized how much she was looking forward to that dinner . Again she looked down at her notes . Dr. Fukhito . Something was wrong there . It seemed to her that he 'd deliberately weighed every word he said when he 'd discussed Vangie 's Monday-night visit . It had been like watching someone walk step by step through a mined field . What was he afraid of ? Even allowing for the reasonable concern of protecting the doctor  --  patient relationship , he 'd been afraid he would say something that she would pounce on . Then he 'd been openly hostile when she asked if by any chance Vangie might still have been in the hospital at ten o'clock when she , Katie , was brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been just leaving Dr. Fukhito 's office ; had been walking somewhere in the parking lot ? That would explain seeing her face in that crazy nightmare . Dr. Fukhito had said that Vangie left by his private entrance . No one had seen her go . Suppose she had n't left ? Suppose she 'd stayed with the doctor . Suppose he 'd left with her or followed her home . Suppose he 'd real-  | ized that she was suicidal , that he was responsible in some way .. . Enough to make him nervous . The waiter arrived to take her order . Before she put away the pad , Katie made one final note : Investigate Dr. Fukhito 's background .  | EVEN BEFORE he crossed the George Washington Bridge and drove down the Harlem River and FDR Drive Wednesday evening , Richard knew that he should have cancelled the date with Clovis . He was preoccupied about Vangie Lewis ' death ; his subconscious was suggesting that he had missed something in the autopsy . There had been something he 'd intended to examine more closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie . She had looked so thin last night . She 'd been extremely pale . It was n't until she 'd had a couple of glasses of wine that some color had come into her face . Katie was n't well . That was it . He was a doctor and should have spotted it sooner . That accident . How carefully had she been examined ? Was it possible that she 'd been hurt more than anyone realized ? The thought haunted Richard as he turned onto the Fifty-third Street exit from the FDR Drive and headed for Clovis ' apartment one block away . Clovis had a pitcher of very dry martinis waiting to be poured and a plate of hot crabmeat-filled puffs fresh from the oven . With her flawless skin , tall , slender body and Viking coloring , she reminded Richard of a young Ingrid Bergman . Until recently he 'd toyed with the idea that they might end up together . Clovis was intelligent , interesting and good-tempered . But as he returned her kiss with honest affection , he was acutely  | aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now found himself worrying about Katie DeMaio . He realized Clovis was talking to him . " . . . and I 'm not home ten minutes . The rehearsal ran over . There was a lot of rewriting . So I fixed the drinks and nibbles and figured you could relax while I get dressed . Hey , are you listening to me ? " Richard accepted the drink and smiled apologetically . " I 'm sorry . I 'm on a case that wo n't let go . Do you mind if I make a couple of calls while you 're getting ready ? " " Of course I do n't mind , " Clovis said . " Go ahead and dial away . " She picked up her glass and started toward the foyer that led into the bedroom and bath . Richard took his credit card from his wallet and dialed the operator . There was no way he was going to put a call to one woman on another woman 's phone bill . Quickly he gave his account number to the operator . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen times before he finally gave up . Katie was n't home . Next he tried Molly 's house . Probably Katie had stopped there . But Molly had not spoken to her at all today . " I do n't really expect her , " Molly said . " You 're both coming tomorrow night . Do n't forget that . She 'll probably call me later . But I wish she 'd gone home by now . She could stand taking it easy . " It was the opening he needed . " Molly , what 's the matter with Katie ? " he asked . " There is something wrong physically , is n't there ? Besides the accident , I mean ? " Molly hesitated . " I think you 'd better talk to Katie about that . " Certainty . Cold fear washed over him . " Molly , I want to know . What 's the matter with her ? " " Oh , not much , " Molly said hastily . " I promise you that . But it 's nothing she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I should . See you tomorrow . " The connection broke . Richard frowned into the dead receiver . He started to replace it on the cradle , then on impulse put through a call to his office . He spoke to the assistant on the evening shift . " Anything unusual going on ? " he asked . " We just got a call for the wagon . A body was found in an apartment in Edgeriver . Probably an accident , but the local police thought we 'd better take a look . Scott 's people are heading over there . " " Switch me to Scott 's office , " Richard said .  | Scott did not waste time on preliminaries . " Where are you ? " he demanded . " In New York . Do you need me ? " " Yes . This woman who was found in Edgeriver is the receptionist Katie wanted to talk to today at Westlake . Name 's Edna Burns . Supposedly she phoned in sick today , but there 's no question she 's been dead a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westlake . I 'm trying to get Katie . I 'd like her to go over there . " " Give me the address , " Richard said . He wrote it quickly and hung up the phone . Katie had wanted to question this Edna Burns about Vangie Lewis , and now Edna Bums was dead . He knocked on Clovis ' bedroom door . She opened it , wrapped in a terry-cloth robe . " Hey , what 's the hurry ? " she asked , smiling . " I just got out of the shower . " " Clo , I 'm sorry . " Quickly he explained . Now he was frantic to get away . She was clearly disappointed . " Oh , of course I understand , but I was counting on seeing you . It 's been a couple of weeks  --  you do know that . All right . Go , but let 's have dinner tomorrow night . Promise ? " Richard temporized . " Well , very soon . " He started to leave , but she caught him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tomorrow night , " she told him firmly .  | ON THE WAY HOME from the restaurant , Katie turned over in her mind the conversation she 'd had with Edna Burns on her first visit to Dr. Highley . Edna was a born listener . Katie was not given to discussing her personal affairs , but when Edna took the preliminary information , she had clucked sympathetically . Not quite believing her own ears , Katie had heard herself telling Edna all about John . How much had Vangie told Edna ? She 'd been going to Westlake since last summer . How much did Edna know about Dr. Fukhito ? There was something oddly intimidating about his nervousness . Why should he be nervous ? Katie pulled up in front of her house and decided not to put the car away yet . It was Wednesday and Mrs. Hodges had been here . The house smelled faintly of lemon wax . The mirror over the antique marble table in the hall was shining . Katie knew her bed had been made with fresh linen ; the ceramic kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vacuumed ; her laundry would be back in the drawers or closet . Mrs. Hodges had worked full time when John was alive . Now pensioned off , she 'd begged for the chance to come in one day a week and take care of " my house . " It would n't last much longer . It could n't . Mrs. Hodges was past seventy now . Whom would she get when Mrs. Hodges no longer came in ? Who  | would exercise the same care with the valuable bric-a-brac , the antiques , the English furniture , the lovely old Orientals ? " It 's time to sell , " Katie thought . " I know it . " Taking off her coat , she tossed it on a chair . If was only a quarter of eight . The night loomed long ahead of her . Edna had told her that she lived in Edgeriver . That was less than twenty minutes ' drive away . Suppose she phoned Edna now ? Suppose she suggested driving down to see her ? Mrs. Fitzgerald had said that Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too sick . If Katie was any judge , Edna would love a chance to gossip about Vangie Lewis . Mrs. Hodges always left a freshly baked cake or pie or muffins in the bread box for Katie . She 'd take whatever was there now down to Edna and have a cup of tea with her . A lot of gossip could be exchanged over a teapot . Edna was listed in the telephone book . Quickly Katie dialed her number . It rang once and the receiver was picked up . She formed the words " Hello , Miss Burns , " but never got to speak them . A man 's voice said , " Yes . " The short word was delivered in a clipped , not-unfamiliar voice . " Is Miss Burns there ? " Katie asked . " This is Mrs. DeMaio from the Prosecutor 's office . " " Katie ! " Now she recognized the voice . It was Charley Nugent , and he was saying , " Glad Scott got in touch with you . Can you come right down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hear , Katie asked the question : " What are you doing at Edna Bums 's apartment ? " " Do n't you know ? She 's dead , Katie . Fell  --  or was pushed  --  into the radiator . Split her head open . " His voice lowered . " Get this , Katie . She was last seen alive around eight o'clock last night . A neighbor was with her . " His voice became a whisper . " The neighbor heard her on the phone with Vangie Lewis ' husband . Edna Burns told Chris Lewis that she was going to talk to the police about Vangie 's death . "  | AFTER HE FINISHED the second Scotch he went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator . He had told Hilda not to prepare anything for him tonight , but had given her a long shopping list . He nodded in approval at the new items in the meat drawer : the boneless breasts of chicken , the filet mignon ; the double loin lamb chops . Fresh asparagus , tomatoes and watercress were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheesebox . Tonight he 'd have the lamb chops , asparagus and a watercress salad . Emotional exhaustion always compelled him to eat . The night Claire died , he 'd left the hospital , to all outward appearances a husband benumbed with grief , and had gone to a quiet restaurant a dozen blocks away and eaten heavily . Then he 'd trudged home masking an acute sense of well-being with the weary posture of the griefstricken . The friends who were gathered waiting to greet him , to commiserate with him had been deceived . " Where were you , Edgar ? We were worried about you . " " I do n't know . I do n't remember . I 've just been walking . " It had been the same after Winifred 's death . He 'd left her relatives and friends at the grave site , refused invitations to join them for dinner . " No . No . I need to be alone . " He 'd come back to the house , waited long enough to answer a few phone calls , then contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that I 'm resting and that I 'll return all calls later . " Then he 'd gotten into the car and driven to the Carlyle in New  | York . There he had requested a quiet table and ordered dinner . Halfway through the meal he looked up and saw Winifred 's cousin , Glenn Nickerson , across the room  --  Glenn , the high school athletic coach who had been Winifred 's heir until he came along . Glenn was dressed in the dark blue suit and black tie he 'd worn to the funeral , a bargain-priced , ill-fitting suit obviously bought specially for the occasion . His normal garb was a sports jacket , slacks and loafers . Nickerson was obviously watching him . He 'd lifted his glass in a toast , a mocking smile on his face . He might as well have shouted his thoughts : " To the grieving widower . " He 'd done what was necessary : walked over to him without the slightest sign of distress and spoken pleasantly . " Glenn , why did n't you join me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize you came to the Carlyle . This was a favorite dining spot of ours . We became engaged here  --  or did Winifred ever tell you that ? I 'm not Jewish , but I think that one of the most beautiful customs in this bewildering world is that of the Jewish faith , where after a death the family eats eggs to symbolize the continuity of life . I am here to quietly celebrate the continuity of love . " Glenn had stared at him , his expression stony . Then he 'd stood up and signaled for his check . " I admire your ability to philosophize , Edgar , " he said . " No . I do n't consider the Carlyle one of my regular eating spots . I simply followed you here because I had decided to visit you and reached your block just as your car pulled out . I had the feeling it might be interesting to keep an eye on you . How right I was . " He 'd turned his back on Glenn , walked with dignity back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes later he 'd seen Glenn at the door of the dining room on his way out . The next week , Alan Levine , the doctor who 'd treated Winifred , indignantly told him that Glenn had asked to see Winifred 's medical records . " I threw him out of my office , " Alan said heatedly . " I told him that Winifred had developed classic angina symptoms and that he would do himself a favor if he studied the current statistics on women in their early fifties having heart attacks . Even so , he had the gall to speak to the police . I had a call from the Prosecutor 's office asking in so many words if a heart ailment could be induced . I told them that being alive today was enough to induce heart trouble . They backed off immediately , said it was obviously a disinherited relative trying to cause trouble . "  | But you can induce heart trouble , Dr. Levine . You can prepare intimate little dinners for your dear wife . You can use her susceptibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register as heart seizures on her cardiogram . After enough of these the lady apparently has a fatal seizure . She dies in the presence of her own physician , who arrives to find the physician husband applying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . No one suggests an autopsy . And even if someone had , there would have been little risk . The only risk would have occurred if they had thought to delve into Claire 's death . The chops were nearly cooked . He expertly seasoned the watercress , removed the asparagus from the steamer and took a halfbottle of Beaujolais from the wine rack in the pantry . He had just begun to eat when the phone rang . He debated ignoring it , then decided that at this time it was dangerous to miss any calls . Slapping his napkin on the table , he hurried to the extension in the kitchen . " Dr. Highley , " he said curtly . A sob sounded over the phone . " Doctor  --  oh , Dr. Highley . It 's Gertrude , Gertrude Fitzgerald . Doctor , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened his grip on the receiver . " Doctor , Edna is dead . The police are here . She fell . Doctor , could you come here right away ? They 're talking about performing an autopsy . She always hated autopsies . She used to say how terrible it was to cut up dead people . Doctor , you know how Edna was when she drank . I told them that you 've been here in her apartment that you 've caught her drinking . Doctor , come here and tell them how you would find her sometimes . Oh , please come here and convince them that she fell and that they do n't have to cut her up . "  | BEFORE SHE LEFT the house , Katie made a cup of tea and carried it to the car . Driving with one hand , she held the bubbling liquid to her lips with the other . She 'd planned to bring cake down to Edna and have tea with her . And now Edna was dead . How could a person she 'd met only once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply that Edna was such a good person , so truly concerned with the patients ? So many people were so indifferent , so noncaring . In that one conversation with Edna last month , it had been so easy to talk about John . And Edna had understood . She 'd said , " I know what it is to watch someone die . On the one hand , you want the misery to be over for them . On the other hand you do n't want to let them go . " She 'd shared the aftermath of loss . " When both Mom and Dad died , all my friends said , Now you 're free , Edna . ' And I said , Free for what ? ' And I bet you felt that way too . " Edna reassured her about Dr. Highley . " You could n't find a better doctor for any GYN problem . That 's why it makes me so mad when I hear him criticized . And all those people who file malpractice suits ! Let me tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people think you 're God . They think you can do the impossible . I tell you when a doctor loses a patient today , he has to worry . And I do n't just mean obstetricians . I mean geriatric doctors too . I guess nobody 's supposed to die anymore . " What had Charley meant by telling her that Edna had phoned  | Chris Lewis last night ? In practically the same breath Charley had suggested the possibility of foul play . " I do n't believe it , " Katie said aloud as she turned off Route 4 onto Edgeriver . It would be like Edna to call Chris Lewis to express her sympathy . Was Charley suggesting Edna might have in some way threatened Chris Lewis ? She had a vague idea of where the apartment development was and was able to find it easily . She mused that as garden apartments went , this one was getting somewhat rundown . When she sold the house she 'd probably move into a high-rise for a while . There were some buildings overlooking the Hudson that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be near New York . She 'd be more likely to go to the theater and museums . When I sell the house , she thought . At what point did if become when ? Charley had told her that Edna 's apartment was the last one in units 41 through 6o . He 'd said to drive behind that row and park . She slowed down , realizing that a car had entered the development from another road and was pulling into that same area ahead of her . It was a black medium-sized car . For a moment the driver hesitated , then chose the first parking spot available on the right . Katie pulled around him . If Edna 's apartment was the end one on the left , she 'd try to get closer to it . She found a spot directly behind that building and parked . She got out of the car , realizing that she must be looking at the back window of Edna 's apartment . The window was raised an inch . The shade was pulled down to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the apartment . Katie thought of the view from her bedroom windows . They looked over the little pond in the woods behind the house . Edna had gazed out at a parking area and a rusting chain-link fence . Yet she had told Katie how much she enjoyed her apartment , how cozy it was . Katie heard footsteps behind her and turned quickly . In the lonely parking area , any sound seemed menacing . A figure loomed near her , a silhouette accentuated by the dim light from the solitary lamppost . A sense of familiarity struck her . " Excuse me . I hope I did n't startle you . " The cultured voice had a faint English accent . " Dr. Highley ! " " Mrs. DeMaio . We did n't expect to see each other so soon and under such tragic circumstances . " " Then you 've heard . Did my office call you , Doctor ? "  | " It 's chilly . Here . Let 's take this footpath around the building . " Barely touching her elbow with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald called me . She substituted for Miss Burns today and evidently she was the one to find her . She sounded terribly upset and begged me to come . I do n't have any details of what happened as yet . " " Neither do I , " Katie replied . They were turning the corner to the front of the building when she heard rapid footsteps behind them . " Katie . " She felt the pressure of the doctor 's fingers on her elbow tighten and then release as she looked back . Richard was there . She turned , absurdly glad to see him . He grasped both her shoulders . In a gesture that ended even as it began , he pulled her to him . Then his hands dropped . " Scott reached you ? " " No . I happened to call Edna myself . Oh , Richard , this is Dr. Edgar Highley . " Quickly she introduced the two men , and they shook hands . Katie thought , How absurd this is . I am making introductions and a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them in . He looked relieved to see them . " Your people should be here in a couple of minutes , " he told Richard . " We 've got pictures , but I 'd like you to have a look too . " Katie was used to death . In the course of her job , she constantly held up vivid and gory pictures of crime victims . She was usually able to separate herself from the emotional aspect and concentrate on the legal ramifications of wrongful death . But it was a different matter to see Edna crumpled against the radiator in the kind of flannel nightgown her own mother considered indispensable ; to see the blue terry-cloth robe so like the ones her mother used to pick up on sale at Macy 's ; to see the solid evidence of loneliness  --  the slices of canned ham , the empty cocktail glass . Edna had been such a cheery person , who found some small measure of happiness in this shabbily furnished apartment , and even the apartment had betrayed her . It had become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the old-fashioned velour couch at the opposite end of the L-shaped room , out of sight of the body . She was sobbing softly . Richard went directly into the dinette to examine the dead woman . Katie walked over to Mrs. Fitzgerald and sat beside her on the couch . Dr. Hjghley followed her and pulled up a straight-backed chair .  | Gertrude tried to talk to them . " Oh , Dr. Highley , Mrs. DeMaio , is n't this terrible , just terrible ? " The words brought a fresh burst of sobs . Katie gently put a hand on the trembling shoulders . " I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Fitzgerald . I know you were fond of Miss Burns . " " She was always so nice . Such fun . She always made me laugh . And maybe she had that little weakness . Everybody has a little weakness , and she never bothered anyone with it . Oh , Dr. Highley , you 'll miss her too . " Katie watched as the doctor bent over Gertrude , his face grave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelously efficient person . She took so much pride in her work . Dr. Fukhito and I used to joke that she had our patients so relaxed by the time we saw them that she could have put Dr. Fukhito out of his job . " " Doctor , " Gertrude blurted out , " I told them you 've been here . I told them that . You knew Edna 's little problem . It 's just silly to say she did n't fall . Why would anyone want to hurt her ? " Dr. Highley looked at Katie . " Edna suffered from sciatica , and when she was laid up I occasionally dropped off work for her to do at . home . Certainly not more than three or four times . On one occasion when she was supposed to be ill , I came here unexpectedly and it was then I realized that she had a serious drinking problem . " Katie looked past him and realized that Richard had completed examining the body . She got up , walked over to him and looked at Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oh Lord . May legions of angels greet her . May she be conducted to a place of refreshment , light and peace . Swallowing over the sudden lump in her throat , she quietly asked Richard what he had found . He shrugged . " Until I have had a chance to see how bad the fracture is , I 'd say it could go either way . Certainly it was a hell of a smash , but if she was drunk-and it 's obvious she was  --  she might have stumbled when she tried to get up . She was a pretty heavy woman . On the other hand , there 's a big difference between being run over by a car and by a train . And that 's the kind of difference we have to evaluate . " " Any sign of forced entry ? " Katie asked Charley . " None . But these locks are the kind you could spring with a credit  | card . And if she was as drunk as we think she was , anyone could have walked in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? What were you telling me about Captain Lewis ? " " The superintendent 's wife  --  name 's Gana Krupshak  --  was a buddy of Edna Burns . Fact is , she was with Mrs. Fitzgerald when the body was found . We let her go to her own apartment just before you came . She 's shook up bad . Anyhow , last night she came over here around eight o'clock . She said Edna already had a bag on . She stayed till eight thirty , then decided to put out the ham , hoping Edna would eat something and start to sober up . Edna told her about Vangie 's suicide . " " Exactly what did she tell her ? " Katie asked . " Nothing much . Just mentioned Vangie 's name and how pretty she 'd been . Then Mrs. Krupshak went into the kitchen and she heard Edna dialing the phone . Mrs. Krupshak could hear most of the conversation . She swears Edna called whoever she was talking to Captain Lewis ' and told him she had to talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Edna give Lewis directions for driving here and then Edna said something about Prince Charming . " " Prince Charming ! " Charley shrugged . " Your guess is as good as mine . But the witness is positive . " Richard said , " Obviously we 'll treat this as a potential homicide . I 'm beginning to agree with Scott 's hunch about Chris Lewis . " He glanced into the living room . " Mrs. Fitzgerald looks pretty washed out . Are you through talking to her , Katie ? " " Yes . She 's in no condition to question now . " " I 'll get one of the squad cars to drive her home , " Charley volunteered . " One of the other guys can follow in her car . " Katie thought , I do not believe Chris Lewis could have done this to Edna ; I do n't believe he killed his wife . She looked around . " Are you sure there 's nothing valuable missing ? " Charley shrugged . " This whole place would go for about forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pocketbook ; eighteen dollars there . Credit cards . The usual . No sign of anything being disturbed , let alone ransacked . " " All right . " Katie returned to Dr. Highley and Gertrude . " We 're going to have you driven home , Mrs. Fitzgerald , " she said gently . " What are they going to do to Edna ? "  | " They must investigate the extent of her head injuries . I do n't think they 'll probe beyond that . But if there is even the faintest chance that someone did this to Edna , we have to know it . Think of it as a way of showing we valued her life . " The woman sniffled . " I guess you 're right . " She looked at the doctor . " Dr. Highley , I had an awful nerve asking you to come here . I 'm sorry . " " Not at all . " He was reaching into his pocket . " I brought these sedatives along in case you needed them . As long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll get a glass of water , " Katie said . She went to the sink in the bathroom . The bathroom and bedroom were off a rear foyer . As she let the water run cold , she realized that she hated the idea that Chris Lewis was emerging as a prime suspect in two deaths . Taking the water glass back to Gertrude , she again sat beside her . " Mrs. Fitzgerald , just to satisfy ourselves , we want to be positive there 's no possibility of Edna 's having been robbed . Do you know if she kept any valuables  --  any jewelry , perhaps ? " " Oh , she had a ring and a pin she was so proud of . She only wore them on special occasions . I would n't know where she kept them . This is the first time I 've been here , you see . Oh , wait a minute . Doctor . I remember that Edna said she showed you her ring and pin . In fact , she told me she showed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you can help Mrs. DeMaio . " Katie looked into the cold gray eyes . He hates this , she thought . He 's really angry to be here . He does n't want to be part of this . Had Edna had a crush on the doctor ? she wondered suddenly . Had she exaggerated the number of times he might have dropped off work , maybe even hinted to Gertrude that he was a little interested in her ? Maybe without even meaning to shade the truth , she 'd invented a little romance , fantasized a possible relationship with him . If so , it was no wonder Mrs. Fitzgerald had rushed to summon him , no wonder he looked acutely embarrassed and uncomfortable now . " I really do n't know of hiding places , " he said , his voice stiff with an undercurrent of sarcasm . " One time Edna did show me a pin and ring that were in a box in her night-table drawer . I hardly consider that a hiding place . " " Would you show me , Doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer into the bedroom . Katie switched on the lamp , a cheap ginger-jar base with a pleated paper shade .  | " It was in there , " Dr. Highley told her , pointing to the drawer in the night table on the right side of the bed . Using only the very tips of her fingers , Katie opened the drawer . She knew that there 'd probably be a complete search for evidence and the fingerprint experts would be called in . The drawer was unexpectedly deep . Reaching into it , Katie pulled out a blue plastic jewelry case . When she raised the lid , the bell-like tinkle of a music box intruded on the somber silence . A small brooch and a thin old diamond ring were nestled against cotton velvet . " Those are the treasures , I guess , " Katie said , " and that , I would imagine , eliminates the robbery theory . We 'll keep this in the office until we know who the next of kin is . " She started to close the drawer , then stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look . " Hastily she set the jewelry box on the bed and reached into the drawer . " My mother used to keep her mother 's old battered black hat for sentimental reasons , " she said . " Edna must have done the same thing . " She was tugging at an object , pulling it out , holding it up for him to see . It was a brown moccasin , heavily scuffed , badly worn , battered and shabby . It was shaped for the left foot . As Dr. Edgar Highley stared at the shoe , Katie said , " This was probably her mother 's and she considered it such a treasure she kept it with that pathetic jewelry . Oh , Doctor , if memorabilia could talk , we 'd have a lot of stories to hear , would n't we ? "  | AT PRECISELY EIGHT A.M. Thursday morning , the Investigative Squad of the Homicide Division of Valley County pulled up to the Lewis home . The six-man team was headed by Phil Cunningham and Charley Nugent . The detectives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , master bath and kitchen . It was admittedly a slim possibility that they would find significant fingerprints that did not belong to either Chris or Vangie Lewis . But the lab report had raised another question . Vangie 's fingerprints were on the tumbler that had been lying next to her , but there was some question about the positioning of those prints . Vangie had been right-handed . When she poured the cyanide crystals into the glass , it would have been natural for her to hold the glass with her left hand and pour with her right . But only her right prints were on the tumbler . It was an inconclusive , troublesome fact that further discredited the apparent suicide . The medicine chests in both bathrooms and the guest powder room had already been searched after the body was found . Once again they were examined in minute detail . Every bottle was opened , sniffed . But the bitter-almond scent they were looking for was not to be found . Charley said , " She must have kept the cyanide in something . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass and then flushed the envelopes or capsule she had it in down the john ? " Phil suggested .  | The bedroom was carefully vacuumed in the hope of finding human hair that did not come from the head of either Vangie or Chris . As Phil put it : " Any house can have hairs from delivery people , neighbors , anybody . We 're all shedding hair all the time . But most people do n't bring even good friends into the bedroom . So if you find human hair that does n't belong to the people who sleep in the bedroom , you just might have something . " Particular attention was given to the shelves in the garage . The usual half-empty cans of paint , turpentine , some garden tools , hoses , insecticides , rose powder and weed killer were there in abundance . Phil grunted in annoyance as the prong of a hand spade pulled at his jacket . That prong had been protruding over the edge of the shelf , its handle wedged into place between the end of the shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve , he noticed a sliver of printed cotton hooked on the prong . That print . He 'd seen it recently . It was that faded Indian stuff ; madras . The dress Vangie Lewis was wearing when she died . He called the police photographer out to the garage . " Get a picture of that , " he said , pointing to the tool . " I want a close-up of that material . " When the picture was taken , he carefully removed the piece of material from the prong and sealed it in an envelope . In the house , Charley was going through the desk in the living room . Funny , he thought . You can get a real slant on people from the way they keep their records . Chris Lewis obviously had taken care of all the bookkeeping in the family . The checkbook stubs were precisely written , the balances accurate to the penny . Bills were apparently paid in full as they came in . The large bottom drawer held upright files . They were alphabetically arranged : AMERICAN 13CPRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERSONAL LETTERS . Charley reached for the personal-letter file . Quickly he leafed through it . Chris Lewis maintained a regular correspondence with his mother . Many thanks for the check , Chris . You should n't be so generous . That was written only two weeks ago . A January letter began : Got Dad the TV for the bedroom and he 's enjoying it so much . One from last July : The new air conditioner is such a blessing . If Charley was disappointed at not finding more significant personal data , he did admit grudgingly that Christopher Lewis was a concerned and generous son to aging parents . He reread the mother 's letters , hoping for clues to Vangie and Chris 's relationship . The re-  | cent letters all ended the same way : Sorry Vangie is n't feeling well or Women do sometimes have difficult pregnancies or Tell Vangie we 're rooting for her . At noon , Charley and Phil decided to leave the rest of the team to complete the search and return to the office themselves . They were scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ruled out forced entry . There was no trace of cyanide in the house or garage . The contents of Vangie 's stomach revealed that she 'd eaten lightly on Monday ; that she had probably had toast and tea about five hours before she died . A new loaf of bread in the bread box had two slices missing . The soiled dishes in the dishwasher told their own story : a single dinner plate , cup and saucer , salad dish , probably from Sunday night ; a juice glass and cup , Monday 's breakfast ; a cup , saucer and plate with toast crumbs from the Monday supper . Vangie had apparently dined alone Sunday night ; no one had eaten with her Monday night . The coffee mug in the sink had not been there Tuesday morning . Undoubtedly Chris Lewis had made himself instant coffee sometime after the body was found . The driveway and grounds were being searched with minute care and so far revealed nothing unusual . " They 'll be at this all day , but we have n't missed anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that she tore her dress on that prong on the garage shelf , we 've come up with a big zero . Wait a minute . We still have n't checked the answering service for messages . " He got the Federated Answering Service number from the file in the desk , dialed and identified himself . " Give me any messages left for either Captain or Mrs. Lewis starting with Monday , " he ordered . Taking out his pen , he began to write . Phil looked over his shoulder : Monday , February 15 , 4:00 P.M. Northwest Orient Reservations phoned . Mrs. Lewis is confirmed on Flight 235 at 4:10 P.M. from LaGuardia Airport to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/St . Paul on Tuesday , February 16 . Phil whistled silently . Charley asked , " Did Mrs. Lewis receive that message ? " He held the phone slightly away from his ear so that Phil could hear . " Oh , yes , " the operator said . " I was on the board myself Monday evening and gave it to her at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sounded very relieved . In fact , she said , Oh , thank God . " " All right , " Charley said . " What else have you got ? "  | " Monday , February fifteenth , nine thirty P.M. Dr. Fukhito left word for Mrs. Lewis to call him at home as soon as she got in . He said she had his home number . " Charley raised one eyebrow . " Is that it ? " " Just one more , " the operator replied . " A Miss Edna Burns called Mrs. Lewis at ten P.M. Monday . She wanted Mrs. Lewis to be sure and phone her no matter how late it was . " Charley doodled triangles on the pad as the operator told him that there were no further messages on the service for either Tuesday or Wednesday , but that she knew a call had come through Tuesday evening and had been picked up by Captain Lewis . " I was just starting to answer when he came on , " she explained . " I got right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she affirmed that Mrs. Lewis had not learned about either Dr. Fukhito 's or Miss Burns 's call . Mrs. Lewis had not contacted the service after seven thirty on Monday night . " Thank you , " Charley said . " You 've been very helpful . We 'll probably want a complete file of messages you 've taken for the Lewises going back some time , but we 'll be in touch about that later on . " He hung up the receiver and looked at Phil . " Let 's go . Scott 's going to want to hear all about this . " " How do you read it ? " Phil asked . Charley snorted . " How else can I read it ? As of seven thirty Monday evening Vangie Lewis was planning to go to Minneapolis . A couple of hours later she 's dead . As of ten o'clock Monday night , Edna Burns had an important message for Vangie . The next night Edna 's dead and the last person who saw her alive heard her talking to Chris Lewis telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that Japanese shrink who called Vangie Monday night ? " Phil asked . Charley shrugged . " Katie talked to him yesterday . She may have some answers for us. "  | FOR KATIE , WEDNESDAY night seemed endless . She 'd gone to bed as soon as she returned from Edna 's apartment , remembering first to take one of the pills Dr. Highley had given her . She 'd slept fitfully , her subconscious restless with images of Vangie 's face floating through a dream . Before she woke up , that dream dissolved into a new one : Edna 's face as it had looked in death ; Dr. Highley and Richard bending over her . She 'd awakened with vague , troubling questions that eluded her , refusing to come into focus . Her grandmother 's battered old black hat . Why was she thinking about that hat ? Of course . Because of that shabby old shoe Edna obviously prized ; the one she had kept with her jewelry . That was it . But why just one shoe ? Grimacing as she got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had intensified during the night . Her knees , bruised from slamming into the dashboard , felt stiffer now than they had right after the accident . I 'm glad the Boston Marathon is n't being run today , she thought wryly . I 'd never win . Hoping that a hot bath might soak some of the achiness away , she went into the bathroom , leaned down and turned on the taps in the tub . A wave of dizziness made her sway , and she grabbed the side of the tub to keep from falling . After a few moments the sensation receded , and she turned slowly , afraid that she might still faint . The bathroom mirror revealed the deathly pallor of her skin , the faint beads of perspiration on her forehead . It 's this damn bleeding , she  | thought . If I were n't going into the hospital tomorrow night , I 'd probably end up being carried in . The bath did reduce some of the stiffness . Beige foundation makeup minimized the paleness . A new outfit  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew-neck sweater ? completed the attempt at camouflage . At least now I do n't look as though I 'm about to fall on my face , she decided , even if I am . With her orange juice she swallowed another of Dr. Highley 's pills and thought about the still-incredible fact of Edna 's death . After they left Edna 's apartment , she and Richard had gone to a diner for coffee . Richard ordered a hamburger , explaining that he 'd planned to have dinner in New York . He 'd been taking someone out . She was sure of it . And why not ? Richard was an attractive man . He certainly did n't spend all his evenings sitting in his own apartment or in family situations at Molly and Bill 's . Richard had been surprised and pleased when she told him that she 'd gone back to the Palisades restaurant . Then he 'd become preoccupied , almost absentminded . Several times he 'd seemed to be on the verge of asking her a question , then apparently changed his mind . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , going into the house with her , checking that doors and windows were locked . " I do n't know why I feel uncomfortable about you alone in this place , " he 'd told her . She 'd shrugged . " Edna was in a garden apartment with thin walls . No one realized she was hurt and needed help . " " She did n't , " Richard said shortly . " She died almost instantly . Katie , that Dr. Highley . You know him ? " ' " I questioned him about Vangie this afternoon , " she 'd hedged . Richard 's frown had lightened . " Of course . All right . See you tomorrow . I imagine Scott will call a meeting about Edna Burns . " " I 'm sure he will . " Richard had looked at her , his expression troubled . " Bolt the door , " he 'd said . There had been no lighthearted good-bye kiss on the cheek . Katie put her orange-juice glass in the dishwasher . Hurriedly she grabbed a coat and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil were beginning the search of the Lewis house this morning . Scott was consciously drawing a web around Chris Lewis  --  a circumstantial web , but a strong one . If only she could prove that there was another avenue to explore before Chris was indicted . The trouble with being arrested on a homicide charge is that  | even if you prove your innocence , you never lose the notoriety . In years to come people would be saying , " Oh , that 's Captain Lewis . He was involved in his wife 's death . Some smart lawyer got him off , but he 's guilty as sin . " She arrived at the office just before seven thirty and was n't surprised to find Maureen Crowley already there . Maureen was the most conscientious secretary they had . Beyond that , she had a naturally keen mind and could handle assignments without constantly asking for direction . Katie stopped at her desk . " Maureen , I 've got a job . Could you come in when you have a minute ? " The girl got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The green sweater she was wearing accentuated the vivid green of her eyes . " How about now , Katie ? Want coffee ? " " Great , " Katie replied , then added , " but no ham on rye  --  at least , not yet . " Maureen looked embarrassed . " I 'm sorry I said that yesterday . You , of all people , are not in a rut . " " I 'm not sure about that . " Katie went into her office , hung up her coat and settled down with the pad she 'd used at Westlake Hospital . Maureen brought in the coffee , pulled up a chair and waited silently , her steno book on her lap . " Here 's the problem , " Katie said slowly . " We 're not satisfied that the Vangie Lewis death is a suicide . Yesterday I talked with her doctors , Dr. Highley and Dr. Fukhito , at Westlake Hospital . " She heard a sharp intake of breath and looked up quickly . The girl 's face had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened her cheekbones . " Maureen , is anything the matter ? " " No . No . I 'm sorry . " " Did I say anything to startle you ? " " No . Really . " " All right . " Unconvinced , Katie looked back at her pad . " As far as we know , Dr. Fukhito , the psychiatrist at Westlake , was the last person to see Vangie Lewis alive . I want to find out as much as I can about him as fast as possible . Check the Valley County Medical Society and the AMA . I 've heard he does volunteer work at Valley Pines Hospital . Maybe you can learn something there . Emphasize the confidentiality , but find out where he came from , where he went to school , other hospitals he 's been connected with , his personal background : whatever you can get . "  | " You do n't want me to talk to anyone at Westlake Hospital ? " " Good heavens , no . I do n't want anyone there to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason the younger woman seemed relieved . " I 'll get right on it , Katie . " " It 's not really fair to have you come in early to do other work and then throw a job at you . Good old Valley County is n't into overtime . We both know that . " Maureen shrugged . " That does n't matter . The more I do in this office , the more I like it . Who knows ? I may go for a law degree myself , but that means four years of college and three years of law school . " " You 'd be a good lawyer , " Katie said , meaning it . " I 'm surprised you did n't go to college . " " I was insane enough to get engaged the summer I finished high school . My folks persuaded me to take the secretarial course before I got married so at least I 'd have some kind of skill . How right they were . The engagement did n't stand the wait . " " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? " Katie asked . The girl 's face became brooding . Katie thought how unhappy she looked and decided that Maureen must have been pretty hurt about the breakup . Not quite looking at Katie , Maureen said , " I was feeling restless and did n't want to settle down to being a schoolgirl . It was a good decision . " She went out of the room . The telephone rang . It was Richard . His voice was guarded . " Katie , I 've just been talking to Dave Broad , the head of prenatal research at Mt . Sinai . On a hunch , I sent the fetus Vangie Lewis was carrying over to him . Katie , my hunch was right . Vangie was not pregnant with Chris Lewis ' child . The baby I took from her womb has distinctly Oriental characteristics ! "  | EDGAR HIGHLEY STARED at Katie DeMaio as she stood with that shoe in her hand , holding it out to him . Was she mocking him ? No . She believed what she was saying , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to have that shoe . If only she did n't talk about it to the Medical Examiner or the detectives . Suppose she decided to show it to them ? Gertrude Fitzgerald might recognize it . She 'd been at the desk many times when Vangie came in . He 'd heard Edna joke with her about Vangie 's glass slippers . Katie put the shoe back , closed the drawer and walked out of the bedroom , the jewelry box tucked under her arm . He followed her , desperate to hear what she would say . But she simply handed the jewelry box to the detective . " The ring and pin are here , Charley , " she said . " I guess that shoots any possibility of burglary . I did n't go through the bureau or closet . " " It does n't matter . If Richard suspects wrongful death , we 'll search this place with a fine-tooth comb in the morning . " There was a staccato rap at the door , and Katie opened it to admit two men carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drunk the water in the glass Katie had given her . " I 'll get you more water , Mrs. Fitzgerald , " he said quietly . He glanced over his shoulder . The others all had their backs to him , as they watched the attendants prepare to lift the body . It was his chance . He had to risk taking the shoe . As  | long as Katie had n't mentioned it immediately , it was unlikely she 'd bring it up now . He walked rapidly to the bathroom , turned on the tap and slipped across the hall to the bedroom . Using his handkerchief to avoid fingerprints , he opened the night-table drawer . He was just reaching for the shoe when he heard footsteps coming down the hall . Quickly he pushed the drawer shut , stuffed his handkerchief into his pocket and was standing at the door of the bedroom when the footsteps stopped . Willing himself to appear calm , he turned . Richard Carroll , the Medical Examiner , was standing in the foyer between the bedroom and the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I 'd like to ask you a few questions about Edna Burns . " His voice was cold . " Certainly . " Then , in what he hoped was a casual tone , he added , " I have just been standing here thinking of Miss Burns . What a shame her life was so wasted . " " Wasted ? " Richard 's voice was sharply questioning . " Yes . She actually had a good mathematical mind . In this computer age Edna might have used that talent to make something of herself . Instead , she became an overweight , gossiping alcoholic . If that seems harsh , I say it with real regret . I was fond of Edna , and quite frankly I shall miss her . Excuse me . I 'm letting the water run . I want to give Mrs. Fitzgerald a glass of cold water . Poor woman , she 's terribly distressed . " Dr. Carroll stood aside to let him pass . Had his criticism of Edna distracted the Medical Examiner from wondering what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled it and brought it to Gertrude . The attendants had left with the body , and Katie DeMaio was not in the room . " Has Mrs. DeMaio left ? " he asked the detective . " No . She 's talking to the super 's wife . She 'll be right back . " He did not want to leave himself until he was sure that Katie did not talk about the shoe in front of Gertrude . But when she came back a few minutes later , she did not mention it . They left the apartment together . The local police would keep it under surveillance until the official search was completed . Deliberately he walked with Katie to her car , but then the Medical Examiner joined them . " Let 's have coffee , Katie , " he said . " You know where the Golden Valley diner is , do n't you ? "  | The Medical Examiner waited until she was in the car and had started to pull out before he said , " Good night , Dr. Highley " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided there was a personal relationship of some sort between Katie DeMaio and Richard Carroll . When Katie bled to death , Richard Carroll would be both professionally and emotionally interested in the cause of death . He would have to be very , very careful . There was hostility in Carroll 's attitude toward him . But Carroll had no reason to be hostile to him . Should he have gone over to Edna 's body ? But what would have been the point ? He should not have pushed her so hard . Should he have robbed her ? That had been his original intention . If he had , he would have found the shoe last night . But Edna had talked . Edna had told Gertrude that he 'd been at her apartment . Edna might even have made it sound more frequent , more important . Gertrude had told Katie that he knew where the pitiful jewelry was kept . If they decided Edna had been murdered , would they tie the murder to Edna 's job at the hospital ? What else had Edna told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Katie was the key . Katie DeMaio . With her safely out of the way there was no evidence to tie him to Vangie 's death  --  or Edna 's . The office files were in perfect order . The current patients could bear the most minute scrutiny . He turned into his driveway , drove into the garage , entered the house . The lamb chops were on the plate , cold and edged with grease ; the asparagus had wilted ; the salad was limp and warm . He would reheat the food in the microwave oven , prepare a fresh salad . In a few minutes the table would look as it had before the phone call . As he once again prepared the food , he found himself becoming calm . He was so near to being safe . And soon it would be possible to share his genius with the world . He already had his success . He could prove it beyond doubt . Someday he would be able to proclaim it . Not yet , but someday . And he would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to offer even a shred of proof . He had accurate records , scientific documentation , pictures , X-rays , the step-by-step , day-by-day accounts of all the problems that had arisen and how he had dealt with them . All in the files in his secret safe .  | When the proper time came he would bum the files about the failures and claim the recognition that was due him . By then there would surely be more triumphs . Nothing must stand in his way . Vangie had nearly spoiled everything . Suppose he had not met her just as she came out of Fukhito 's office ? Suppose she had n't told him about her decision to consult Emmet Salem ? Happenstance . Luck . Call it what you will . But it had also been happenstance that sent Katie DeMaio to the window just as he left with Vangie 's body . And exquisite irony that Katie had come to him in the first place . Once again he sat down at the table . With intense satisfaction he saw that the dinner looked as appetizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The watercress was crisp and fresh ; the chops bubbling ; the asparagus piping hot under a delicate hollandaise . He poured wine into a thin goblet , admiring the delicate satiny feel of the crystal as he picked it up . The wine had the hearty Burgundy flavor he 'd been anticipating . He ate slowly . As always , food restored his sense of well-being . He would do what he must , and then he 'd be safe . Tomorrow was Thursday . The Newsmaker article would be on the stands . It would enhance his social as well as his medical prestige . The fact that he was a widower lent him a specific appeal . He knew how his patients talked . " Dr. Highley is so brilliant . He 's so distinguished . He has a beautiful home in Parkwood . " After Winifred 's death , he had allowed his connections with her friends to lapse . There was too much hostility there . That cousin of hers kept making insinuations . He knew it . That was why these three years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found solitude a sacrifice . His work was all-absorbing , all-satisfying . The time dedicated to it had been rewarded . His worst professional critics admitted that he was a good doctor , that the hospital was magnificently equipped , that the Westlake , Maternity Concept was being copied by other physicians . " My patients are not allowed to drink or smoke during their pregnancies , " he had told the Newsmaker interviewer . " They are required to follow a specific diet . Many so-called barren women would have the babies they want if they would show the same dedication as athletes in training . Many of the long-range health problems suffered today would have been prevented entirely if mothers had not been eating the wrong food , taking the wrong medication . We have had  | the visible example of what Thalidomide did to scores of unfortunate victims . We recognize that a mother on drugs may produce an infant addict ; an alcoholic mother will often be delivered of a retarded , undersized , emotionally disturbed child . But what of the many problems that we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyslexia , hyperactivity , asthma , hearing and sight impairment ? I believe that the place to eliminate these is not in the laboratory , but in the womb . I will not accept a patient who will not cooperate with my methods . I can show you dozens of women I have treated with a history of several miscarriages who now have children . Many more could experience that same joy , if they were willing to change their habits , particularly their eating and drinking habits . Many others would conceive and bear a child if their emotions were not so disturbed that in effect they are wearing mental contraceptives far more efficient than any device for sale in the drugstore . This is the reason , the basis of the Westlake Maternity Concept . " The Newsmaker reporter had been impressed . But her next question was a loaded one . " Doctor , is n't it a fact that you have been criticized for the exorbitant fees you charge ? " " Exorbitant is your word . My fees , aside from rather spartan living expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . " " Doctor , is n't it a fact that a large percentage of your cases have been women who miscarried several times under your care , even after following your schedule rigidly  --  and paying you ten thousand dollars , plus all ' hospital and lab expenses ? " " It would be insanity for me to claim that I could bring every difficult pregnancy to term . Yes . There have been cases where the desired pregnancy was begun , but spontaneously aborted . After several of these occurrences , I suggest that my patient adopt a child and help to arrange a suitable adoption . " " For a fee . " " Young woman , I assume you are being paid to interview me . Why do n't you use your time for volunteer work ? " It had been foolish to attack the reporter like that . Foolish to risk animosity , foolish to give her any reason to discredit him , to delve too deeply into his background . He 'd told her that he 'd been obstetrical chief in Liverpool before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed Christ Hospital in Devon . The interviewer 's next question had been meant to entrap him .  | " Doctor , you perform abortions , do you not ? " " Yes , I do . " " Is n't that incongruous for an obstetrician ? To try to save one fetus and to eliminate another ? " " I refer to the womb as a cradle . I despise abortion . And I deplore the grief I witness when women come to me who have no hope of conceiving because they have had abortions and their wombs have been pierced by stupid , blundering , careless doctors . I think everyone ? and I include my colleagues  --  would be astounded to learn how many women have denied themselves any hope of motherhood because they decided to defer that motherhood by abortion . It is my wish that all women carry their babies to healthy term . For those who do not want to , at least I can make sure that when they eventually want a child , they will still be able to have one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude had changed . He finished eating . Now he leaned back in the chair and poured more wine into his glass . He was feeling expansive , comfortable . The laws were changing . In a few years he 'd be able to announce his genius without fear of prosecution . Vangie Lewis , Edna Burns , Winifred , Claire . . . they 'd be unrelated statistics . The trail would be cold . He studied the wine as he drank , refilled his glass and drank again . He was tired . Tomorrow morning he had a cesarean section scheduled  --  another difficult case that would add to his reputation . It had been a difficult pregnancy , but the fetus had a strong heartbeat ; it should be delivered safely . The mother was a member of the socially prominent Payne family . The father , Delano Aldrich , was an officer of the Rockefeller Foundation . This was the sort of family whose championship would make the difference if the Devon scandal were ever to surface again . Only one obstacle left . He had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin now to prepare the substitute file that he would show to the police after her death . Instead of the history she 'd given him of prolonged periods of bleeding over the past year , he would write , " Patient complains of frequent and spontaneous hemorrhaging , unrelated to monthly cycles . " Instead of sponginess of uterine walls , probably familial , a condition that would be remedied indefinitely by a simple D-and-C , he would note findings of vascular breakdown . Instead of a slightly low  | hemoglobin he would indicate that the hemoglobin was chronically in the danger zone . He went into the library . The file marked KATHLEEN DEMAIO which he had taken from the office was on top of his desk . From the drawer he extracted a new file and put Katie 's name on it . For half an hour he worked steadily , consulting the office file for information on her previous medical history . Finally he was finished . He would bring the revised file with him to the hospital . He added several paragraphs to the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put in the wall safe when completed . Patient was in minor automobile accident on Monday night , February 15 . At 2:00 a.m. patient , in sedated condition , observed from the window of her room the transferral of the remains of Vangie Lewis by this physician . Patient still does not understand that what she observed was a true event rather than an hallucination . Patient is slightly traumatized by accident , and persistent hemorrhaging . Inevitably she will be able to achieve clear recollection of what she observed and for this reason can not be permitted to remain as a threat to this physician . Patient received blood transfusion on Monday night in emergency room of hospital . This physician prescribed second transfusion on pretense of preparation for Saturday surgery . This physician also administered anticoagulant medication , cumadin pills to be taken on regular basis until Friday night . Pursing his lips , he laid down the pen . It was easy to imagine how he would complete this report . Patient entered the hospital at 6:0o p.m . Friday , February 19 , complaining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by Nurse Renge , found the patient hemorrhaging . Blood pressure was falling rapidly . With whole blood hanging , emergency surgery was performed at 9:45 P.M. The patient , Kathleen Noel DeMaio , expired at io:oo p.m . He smiled in anticipation of completing this troublesome case . Every detail was perfectly planned , even to assigning Nurse Renge to floor duty Friday night . She was young , inexperienced and terrified of him . After putting the file in the temporary hiding place in the top desk  | drawer , he went upstairs to bed and slept soundly until six in the morning . Three hours later he delivered a healthy baby boy by cesarean section to Mrs. Delano Aldrich and accepted as his due the tearful gratitude of the patient and her husband .  | THE FUNERAL SERVICE for Vangie was held on Thursday morning at ten o'clock in the chapel of a Minneapolis funeral home . His heart aching with pity for Vangie 's parents , Chris stood beside them , their muffled sobs assaulting him like hammer blows . Could he have done things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placate Vangie , would she be lying here now ? If he 'd insisted that she go with him to a marriage counselor years ago , would it have helped their marriage ? He had suggested that to her . But she had refused . " I do n't need any counseling , " she 'd said . " And do n't you suggest anytime I get upset about anything that there 's something the matter with me . It 's the other way around . You never get upset about anything ; you do n't care about anything or anybody . You 're the problem , not me . " Oh , Vangie . Vangie . Was truth somewhere in the middle ? He had stopped caring very early in their marriage . Her parents had been outraged to hear that Vangie could not be buried , that her body was to be shipped back east . " Why ? " " I simply do n't know . " There was no use in answering beyond that not now . " Amazing grace , how sweet the sound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once was lost but now am found . " Months ago , last summer , he 'd felt life was bleak and hopeless . Then he 'd gone to that party in Hawaii . And Joan had been there . He could remember the precise moment he 'd seen her . She was on the terrace in a group of people . Whatever she 'd said made them all  | laugh , and she 'd laughed too , her eyes crinkling , her lips parting , her head tilting back . He 'd gotten a drink and joined that group . And he had n't left Joan 's side again that evening . " .. was blind and now I see . " The Medical Examiner would not have released Vangie 's body Tuesday night if he 'd suspected foul play . What had happened to change his mind ? He thought of Edna 's call . How much talking had she done to other people ? Could she throw some light on Vangie 's death ? Before he left Minneapolis , he had to call Dr. Salem . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made him react with such shock last night . Why had Vangie made an appointment to see him ? There had been someone else in Vangie 's life . He was sure of it now . Suppose Vangie had killed herself in front of someone and that person brought her home ? God knew she 'd have had plenty of opportunity to be involved with another man . He was away from home at least half the month . Maybe she had met someone after they moved to New jersey . But would Vangie have caused herself pain ? Never ! The minister was saying the final prayer . " . . . when every tear shall be dried . . . " Chris led Vangie 's parents into the anteroom and accepted the expressions of sympathy from the friends who had attended the service . Vangie 's parents were going to stay with relatives . They had agreed that the body should be cremated in New Jersey and the urn returned to be buried in the family plot . Finally Chris was able to get away . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club in downtown Minneapolis and took the elevator to the fourteenth floor . There in the solarium he ordered a Bloody Mary and took it to a phone . When he reached Dr. Salem 's office , he said , " This is Vangie Lewis ' husband . It 's urgent I speak with the doctor immediately . " " I 'm sorry , " the nurse told him . " Dr. Salem left a short time ago for the American Medical Association convention in New York . He will not be back until next week . " " New York . " Chris digested the information . " Can you tell me where he 's staying , please ? It may be necessary for me to contact him there . " The nurse hesitated . " I suppose it 's all right to tell you that . I 'm sure Dr. Salem intends to get in touch with you . He asked me to look up your New Jersey phone number , and I know he took your wife 's medical records with him . But just in case he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex House on Central Park South in New York City . His extension there is 3219 . " Chris had pulled out the small notebook that he kept in a compartment of his wallet . Repeating the information , he wrote it down quickly . The top of the page was already filled . On it were Edna Burns 's address and the directions to her apartment in Edgeriver.  | Scary CALLED A NOON MEETING in his office with the same four people who had been present at the meeting a day and a half earlier to discuss Vangie Lewis ' death . This meeting was different . Katie could feel the heightened atmosphere as she went into the office . Scott had Maureen waiting with a pen and paper . " We 're bringing sandwiches in here , " he said . " I 'm due in court again at one thirty and we 've got to move fast on Captain Lewis . " It was as she 'd expected , Katie thought . Scott is zeroing in on Chris . She looked at Maureen . The girl had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It started when I gave her that assignment this morning , Katie thought . Maureen caught her glance and half-smiled . Katie nodded . " Uhhuh . The usual . " Then added , " Did you have any luck with the phoning ? " Maureen looked at Scott , but he was scanning a file and ignoring them . " So far not much . Dr. Fukhito 's not a member of the AMA or the Valley County Medical Society . He donates a lot of his time to disturbed children at Valley Pines Psychiatric Clinic . I have a call in to the University of Massachusetts . He attended medical school there . " " Who told you that ? " Katie asked . Maureen hesitated . " I remember hearing it somewhere . " Katie had a feeling of evasiveness in the answer , but before she  | could probe further , Richard , Charley and Phil came into the office together . Quickly they gave their lunch choices to Maureen , and Richard pulled a chair next to Katie 's . He tossed his arm over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers were warm and strong as for an instant he massaged her neck muscles . " Boy , are you tense , " he said . Scott looked up , grunted , and began to speak . " All right , by now you all know that the baby Vangie Lewis was carrying had Oriental characteristics . So that opens two possibilities . One : with the birth imminent it 's possible she panicked and killed herself . She must have been frantic knowing she could never pass the baby off as her husband 's . The second possibility is that Christopher Lewis found out that his wife had been having an affair and killed her . Let 's try this . Suppose he went home unexpectedly Monday evening . They quarreled . Why was she rushing home to Minneapolis ? Was it because she was afraid of him ? Do n't forget , he never admitted she was going home and she expected to be gone before he returned from his trip . From what Katie tells us , the psychiatrist claims she ran out of his office nearly hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have Maureen checking on him right now . " Scott looked at her . " Are you suggesting that you think there was something between him and Vangie ? " " I 'm not suggesting anything yet , " Katie replied . " The fact that he 's Oriental certainly does n't say that Vangie did n't know another Oriental man . But I can tell you this . He was nervous when I spoke with him yesterday , and he was carefully choosing every word he said to me . I certainly did not get the whole truth from him . " " Which brings us to Edna Burns , " Scott said . " What about it , Richard ? Did she fall or was she pushed ? " Richard shrugged . " It is not impossible that she fell . The alcohol level in her blood was point two five . She was blotto . She was heavy . " " What about that business of drunks and babies being able to fall without getting hurt ? " Katie asked . Richard shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not when your skull cracks into a sharp metal object . I would say that unless someone admits killing Edna , we 'll never be able to prove it . " " But it is possible she was murdered ? " Scott persisted . He shrugged . " Absolutely . "  | " And Edna was heard talking to Chris Lewis about Prince Charming . " Katie spoke slowly . She thought of the handsome psychiatrist . Would someone like Edna refer to him as Prince Charming ? Would she have called Chris after Vangie 's death to tell him she suspected an affair ? " I do n't believe that , " she said . The men looked at her curiously . " What do n't you believe ? " Scott asked . " I do n't believe that Edna was vicious . I know she was n't . I do n't think she ever would have called Chris Lewis after Vangie died to hurt him by telling him about an affair Vangie was having . " " She may have felt sorry enough for him that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richard said . " Or she may have been looking for a few bucks , " Charley suggested . " Maybe Vangie told her something Monday night . Maybe she knew Chris and Vangie had quarreled and why they 'd quarreled . She had nothing . Apparently she was still paying off medical bills for her parents , and they 've been dead a couple of years . Maybe she did n't think there was any harm in putting the arm on Lewis . She did threaten to go to the police . " " She said she had something to tell the police , " Katie objected . " That 's the way the super 's wife put it . " " All right , " Scott said . " What about the Lewis house ? What did you turn up ? " Charley shrugged . " So far , not much . There 's a phone number with a 612 area code scribbled on the pad beside the kitchen phone . It 's not Vangie 's parents ' number , we know that . We thought we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , gave some of her plans . The other thing is that she tore that dress she was wearing on a prong sticking out from the shelf in the garage . " " What do you mean the dress she was wearing ? " Scott demanded . " The dress she was found in . You could n't miss it . It was a long job with one of those madras print designs . " " Where are the clothes she was wearing ? ' Scott asked Richard . ' The lab probably still has them , " Richard said . " We were going over them on a routine check . " Scott picked up the message pad Charley had handed him and tossed it to Katie . " Why do n't you dial this now ? If it 's a woman , you might get more out of her . " Katie dialed the number . There was a pause and then a phone began ringing . " Dr. Salem 's office . " " It 's a doctor 's office , " she whispered , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end she said , ' Perhaps you can help me . I 'm Kathleen DeMaio from the Valley County , New Jersey , Prosecutor 's office . We 're conducting a routine inquiry into the death of Mrs. Vangie Lewis last Monday , and she had the doctor 's phone number on her pad . " She was interrupted : " Oh , that is a coincidence . I just hung up with Captain Lewis . He 's trying to reach the doctor too . As I explained to him , Dr. Salem is on his way to New York right now to the AMA convention . You can reach him later in the day at the Essex House Hotel on Central Park South . " " Fine . We 'll do that . " On a chance , Katie added , " Do you know anything about Mrs. Lewis ' call ? Did she speak with the doctor ? " " No . She did not . She spoke to me . She called Monday and was so disappointed that he was n't going to be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her on Wednesday because he was going right out again . She said she had to see him . " " One last question , " Katie said : " What kind of doctor is Dr. Salem ? " The woman 's tone became proud , " Oh , he 's a prominent obstetrician and gynecologist . " " I see . Thank you . You 've been very helpful . " Katie hung up the phone and reported the conversation to the others . " And Chris Lewis knew about the appointment , " Scott said , " and he wants to talk to the doctor now . I ca n't wait to get at him tonight . We 'll have a lot of questions for him . " There was a knock at the door and Maureen came in without waiting for a response . She was carrying a cardboard tray with inserts for coffee cups and a bag of sandwiches . " Katie , " she said , " that call from Boston about Dr. Fnkhito is just coming in . Do you want to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the phone , holding it out to her . As she waited for the call to be switched , Katie became aware of a slow , persistent headache . That rap against the steering wheel had n't been hard enough for a concussion , but she realized that her head had been bothering her the last few days . I just am not operating on all cylinders , she thought . So many things were teasing her mind . What was she trying to recall ? Something . Some impression . When she explained her credentials , she was quickly switched to the head of personnel at the University of Massachusetts Medical  | School . The man 's voice was guarded . " Yes , Dr. Fukhito graduated from U Mass in the first third of his class . He interned at Massachusetts General and later became affiliated with the hospital and also had a private practice . He left the hospital seven years ago . " " Why did he leave ? " Katie asked . " You must understand this is a police investigation . All information will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any factors in Dr. Fukhito 's past that we should be aware of . " There was a pause ; then the informant said , " Dr. Fukhito was asked to resign seven years ago , and his Massachusetts license was suspended for a period of one year . He was found guilty of unethical behavior after he unsuccessfully defended a malpractice suit . " " What was the cause of the suit ? " Katie asked . " A former patient sued Dr. Fukhito for inducing her to have a personal relationship with him when she was under psychiatric treatment . She had recently been divorced and was in great emotional difficulty . As a result of that relationship she bore Dr. Fukhito 's child . "  | MOLLY BUSTLED AROUND HER KITCHEN rejoicing in the fact that all the children were back in school . Even twelve-year-old Jennifer had been well enough to go this morning ; in fact , had pleaded to go . " You 're just like Katie , " Molly had scolded , " when you set your head to anything . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too cold . I 'll drive you . " Bill was not going into New York until the afternoon . He was planning to attend one of the seminars at the AMA convention . They were enjoying a rare chance to chat in peace as Bill sat at the table sipping coffee and Molly sliced vegetables . " I 'm sure Katie and Richard and the Berkeleys will enjoy each other , " Molly was saying . " Jim Berkeley is bright and he 's a lot of fun . Why is it that most people in advertising really are so interesting ? " " Because their stock in trade is words , " Bill suggested . " Although I must say I 've met some that I would n't spend time looking up again . " " Oh , sure , " Molly agreed absently . " Now , if Liz just does n't spend the whole evening talking about the baby . . . Although I must say she 's getting better about that . When I phoned to invite her the other day she only spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . which , incidentally , is to blow her oatmeal all over the place as she 's being fed . Is n't that cute ? " " It is if it 's your first baby and you waited fifteen years to have  | one , " Bill commented . " I seem to remember every time Jennifer blinked you recorded it in her baby book . " Molly began slicing celery . " Remember your aunt gave me a baby book to keep for the twins . I do n't think I ever got the wrapping paper off it . . . . Anyhow , it should be fun . And even if Liz does rave about the baby , maybe a little of it will sink in on Katie and Richard . " Bill 's eyebrows rose . " Molly , you 're about as subtle as a sledgehammer . You 'd better watch out or they 'll start avoiding each other completely . " " Nonsense . Do n't you see the way they look at each other ? There 's something smoldering  --  better than smoldering  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if Katie was here and then wanted to know if there was something the matter with her . You should have heard how worried he sounded . I tell you he 's crazy about her , but just is smart enough not to show it and scare her off . " " Did you tell him about the operation ? " " No . Katie gave me hell the other morning when I asked if she had told him . Honest to God , the way most people let everything hang out these days . . . Look , why ca n't she just say to Richard , I 've got this problem , it 's a nuisance , Mother had it and had to have a D-and-C every couple of years , and it looks like I 'm built like her ' ? Instead , the poor guy is obviously worried that it 's something serious . I do n't think it 's fair to him .

She reminds me of the last scene in Gone with the Wind when Rhett says to Scarlett , I gave my heart to you and you broke it . Then I gave it to Bonnie and she broke it . I 'll not risk it a third time . ' That 's something of Katie 's problem . But frankly , I think she 's got to work it out herself . Your hovering over her like a mother hawk is n't helping her . I 'd like nothing better than to see her get together with Richard Carroll . He 'd be good for her . " " And he plays golf with you , " Molly interjected . Bill nodded . " That too . " He picked up a stalk of celery and nibbled on it . " A word of advice . If Katie does n't want to tell Richard about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fair to her . If he 's  | persistent in being concerned about her , it has to make some sort of statement to her . You 've gotten them together . Now " Now bug off , " Molly sighed . " Something like that . And tomorrow night when Katie goes into the hospital , you and I are going to the Met . I got tickets for Otello months ago and I do n't plan to change them . You be there when she comes out of the recovery room Saturday morning , but it wo n't hurt her any to wish she had someone with her . Friday evening maybe she 'll do a little thinking . " " Go into the hospital by herself ? " Molly protested . " By herself , " Bill said firmly . " She 's a big girl . " The telephone rang . " Pray it is n't the school nurse saying one of the kids started with the virus again , " Molly muttered . Her " Hello " was guarded . Then her tone became concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me you 're going to cancel on me tonight . " She listened . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , bring her along . You have the folding carriage .... Sure , we 'll put her up in our room and she 'll be fine . . . . Of course I do n't mind . So if she wakes up we 'll bring her down and let her join the party . It 'll be like old times around here .... Great . See you at seven . Bye . " She hung up . " Liz Berkeley 's regular baby-sitter had to cancel and she 's afraid to leave her with someone she does n't know , so she 's bringing the baby along . " " Fine . " Bill looked at the kitchen clock . " I 'd better get out of here . It 's getting late . " He kissed Molly 's cheek . " Will you quit worrying about your little sister ? " Molly bit her lip . " I ca n't . I 've got this creepy feeling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | WHEN RICHARD RETURNED to his office , he stood for a long time staring out the window . His view was somewhat more appealing than the one from Scott 's office . Besides the northeast corner of the county jail , a distinct section of the pocket-sized park in front of the courthouse was visible to him . Only half aware of what he was seeing , he watched as a flurry of sleet weighted snow pelted the alreadyslick frozen grass . Wonderful weather , he thought . He glanced up at the sky . Heavy snow clouds were forming . Vangie Lewis ' body was being flown into Newark from Minneapolis on a two-thirty flight . It would be picked up at seven and brought to the morgue . Tomorrow morning he 'd reexamine it . Not that he expected to find anything more than he already knew . There were absolutely no bruise marks on it . He was sure of that . But there was something about her left foot or leg that he had noticed and dismissed as irrelevant . He pushed that thought aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Vangie had obviously been hiply emotional . Could she have been induced to suicide by Fnkhito ? If Vangie was carrying Fukhito 's child , he must have been panicked . He 'd be finished as a doctor if he were found to be involved with a patient again . But Chris Lewis had a girlfriend  --  a good reason for wanting his wife out of the way . Suppose he had learned of the affair ? Apparently even Vangie 's parents had n't known she was planning to  | come home to Minneapolis . Was it possible Vangie hoped to be delivered of the baby by the Minnesota obstetrician and keep quiet about it ? Maybe she 'd say she 'd lost it . If she wanted to preserve her marriage , she might have been driven to that . Or if she realized a divorce was inevitable , the absolute proof of her infidelity might have weighed in the settlement . None of it rang true . Sighing , Richard reached over , snapped on the intercom and asked Marge to come in . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not collected his messages . She hurried in with a sheaf of slips in her hand . " None of these are too important , " she informed him . " Oh , yes , there was one right after you went to Mr. Myerson 's office . A Dr. Salem . He did n't ask for you by name ; he wanted the Medical Examiner . Then he asked if we had performed the autopsy on Vangie Lewis . I said you were the M.E. and that you 'd performed it personally . He was catching a plane from Minneapolis , but asked if you 'd call him at the Essex House in New York around five o'clock . He sounded anxious to talk to you . " Richard pursed his lips in a soundless whistle . " I 'm anxious to talk to him , " he said . " Oh , and I got the statistics on the Westlake obstetrical patients , " Marge said . " In the eight years of the Westlake Maternity Concept , sixteen patients have died either in childbirth or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marge repeated with emphasis . " However , the practice is huge . Dr. Highley is considered an excellent doctor . Some of the babies he 's brought to term are near miracles , and the women who died had all been warned by other doctors that they were high pregnancy risks . " " I 'll want to study all the fatalities , " Richard said . " But if we ask Scott to subpoena the files from the hospital , we 'll alert them , and I do n't want to do that yet . Have you got anything else ? " " Maybe . In these eight years two people filed malpractice suits against Dr. Highley . Both suits were dismissed . And a cousin of his wife 's came in and claimed that he did n't believe she 'd died of a heart attack . The Prosecutor 's office contacted her personal physician and he said the cousin was crazy . The cousin had been the sole heir before Winifred Westlake married Dr. Highley , so that may be why he wanted to start trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician ? " " Dr. Alan Levine . " " He 's a top internist , " Richard said . " I 'll have a talk with him . " " How about the people who filed the malpractice suits ? Do you want to know who they are ? " " Yes , I do . " " I figured that . Here . " Richard looked down at the two names on the sheet of paper Marge handed him . Anthony Caldwell , Old Country Lane , Peapack , N.J. , and Anna Horan , 415 Walnut Street , Ridgefield Park , N.J. " You do nice work , Marge , " he said . She nodded . " I know . " Her tone was satisfied . " Scott is in court by now . Will you leave word for him to call me when he gets back to his office ? Oh , and tell the lab I want Vangie Lewis ' clothes available to put on her first thing tomorrow morning . All tests have to be finished on the clothing by this afternoon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk . It was after four before Scott returned the call . He listened to Richard 's decision to interview the complainants against Dr. Highley and was clearly not impressed . " Look , today there is n't any doctor , no matter who he is , who is n't hit by malpractice suits . If Dr. Schweitzer were still alive , so help me , he 'd be defending himself against them in the jungle . But go ahead on your own if you want to . We 'll subpoena the hospital records when you 're ready for them . I am concerned about the high number of obstetrical deaths of mothers , but even that may be explainable . He does deal in high-risk pregnancies . " Scott 's voice deepened . " What I 'm most interested in is what this Dr. Salem has to say . You talk with him and get back to me and then I 'll get in on the act . Between you and me , Richard , I think we 're going to pull a tight-enough circumstantial case around Captain Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that his movements are unaccounted for on Monday night , when his wife died . We know Edna Burns called him Tuesday night . We now know that the funeral director left him before nine on Tuesday night . After that he was alone and could easily have gone out . Suppose he did go down and see her ? He 's handy . Charley tells me he 's got sophisticated tools in his garage . Edna was almost blind drunk when she called him . The neighbor told us that . Suppose he drove there , slipped the lock , got into the apartment and shoved that poor  | dame before she knew what hit her ? Frankly , that 's the way my gut sees it , and we 'll have him here tonight to tell us all about it . " " You may be right , " Richard said . " But I 'm still going to check these people out . " He caught Dr. Alan Levine just as he was leaving his office . " Buy you a drink , " Richard suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They agreed to meet at the Parkwood Country Club . A midway point for both of them , it had the virtue of being quiet on weekdays . They 'd be able to talk in the bar without worry about being overheard or having people drop over to say hello . Alan Levine was a Jimmy Stewart  --  at  --  fifty-five look-alike ? a fact that endeared him to his older patients . They enjoyed the easy cordiality of professionals who respected each other , enjoyed a drink together if their paths crossed , waved to each other on the golf links . Richard came directly to the point . " For various reasons we 're interested in Westlake HospitaL Winifred Westlake was your patient . Her cousin tried to insinuate that she did not die of a heart attack . What can you tell me about it ? " Alan Levine looked directly at Richard , sipped his martini , glanced out the picture window at the snow-covered fairway and pursed his lips . " I have to answer that question on a couple of levels , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . For years she 'd had a near-ulcer . Specifically , she had all the classic symptoms of a duodenal ulcer , but it never showed up on X-ray . When she 'd periodically experience pain , I 'd have the usual X-rays done , get negative results , prescribe an ulcer diet , and she experienced relief almost immediately . No great problem . " Then the year before she met and married Highley she had a severe attack of gastroenteritis which actually altered her cardiogram . I put her in the hospital for a suspected heart attack . But after two days in the hospital the cardiogram was well within the normal range . " " So there might or might not have been a problem with her heart ? " Richard asked . " I did n't think there was . It never showed up in the standard tests . But her mother died of a heart attack at fifty-eight . And Winifred was nearly fifty-two when she died . She was older than Highley by some ten years , you know . Several years after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly complaining of chest pains . The tests produced nothing significant I told her to watch her diet "  | " And then she had a fatal attack ? " Richard asked . The other doctor nodded . " One evening , during dinner , she had a seizure . Edgar Highley phoned his service immediately . Gave them my number , the hospital 's number , told them to call the police . From what I was told , Winifred keeled over at the dining-room table . " " You were there when she died ? " Richard queried . " Yes . Highley was still trying to revive her . But it was hopeless . She died a few minutes after I arrived . " " And you 're satisfied it was heart failure ? " Richard asked . Again there was . the hint of hesitation . " She 'd been having chest pains over a period of years . Not all heart trouble shows up on cardiograms . In the couple of years before she died she was suffering periodically from high blood pressure . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . I was satisfied at the time . " " At the time . " Richard underscored the words . " I suppose the cousin 's absolute conviction that something was wrong about her death has troubled me these three years . I practically threw him out of my office when he came in and as much as accused me of falsifying records . Figured he was a disgruntled relative who hated the guy who took his place in the will . But Glenn Nickerson is a good man . He 's coach at Parkwood High , and my kids go there now . They 're all crazy about him . He 's a family man , active in his church , on the town council ; certainly not the . kind of man who would go off half-cocked at being disinherited . And certainly he must have known that Winifred would leave her estate to her husband . She was crazy about Highley . Why , I never could see . He 's a cold fish if ever I met one . " " I gather you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't like him at all . And have you caught the article about him in Newsmaker ? Just came out today . Makes a little tin god of him . He 'll be even more insufferable , I suppose . But I 've got to hand it to him . He 's an excellent doctor . " " Excellent enough to have chemically induced a heart attack in his wife ? " Dr. Levine looked directly at Richard . " Frankly , I 've often wished I 'd insisted on an autopsy . " Richard signaled for the check . " You 've been a great help , Alan . " The other man shrugged . " I do n't see how . What possible use is any of this to you ? "  | " For the present , it gives me insight when I talk to some people . After that , who knows ? " They parted at the entrance to the bar . Richard fished in his pocket for change , went over to the public telephone and phoned the Essex House Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was the jabbing sound of a hotel phone ringing . Three , four , five , six times . The operator broke in . " I 'm sorry , but there 's no answer there . " " Are you sure Dr. Salem has checked in ? " Richard asked . " Yes , sir , I am . He called specifically to say that he was expecting an important phone call and he wanted to be sure to get it . That was only twenty minutes ago . But I guess he changed his mind or something . Because we are definitely ringing his room and there 's no answer . "  | WHEN SHE LEFT SCOTT 'S OFFICE , Katie called in Rita Castile and together they went over the material Katie would need for upcoming trials . " That armed robbery on the twenty-eighth , " Katie said , " where the defendant had his hair cut the morning after the crime . We 'll need the barber to testify . It 's no wonder the witnesses could n't make a positive identification . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't look the same . " " Got it . " Rita jotted down the barber 's address . " It 's too bad you ca n't let the jury know that Benton has a long juvenile record . " " That 's the law , " Katie sighed . " I sure hope that someday it stops bending backward to protect criminals . That 's about all I have for you now , but I wo n't be coming in over the weekend , so next week will really be a mess . Be prepared . " " You wo n't be coming in ? " Rita raised her eyebrows . " Well , it 's about time . You have n't given yourself a full weekend off in a couple of months . I hope you 're planning to go someplace and have fun . " Katie grinned . " I do n't know how much fun it will be . Oh , Rita , I have a hunch that Maureen is upset about something today . Without being nosy , is there anything wrong that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakup with her fiance ? " Rita shook her head . " No , not at all . That was just kid stuff , and she knew it . The usual **44;1154;TOOLONG , an engagement ring the night of the prom . They both realized by  | last summer that they were n't ready to get married . He 's in college now , so that 's no problem . " " Then why is she so unhappy ? " Katie asked . " Regret , " Rita said simply . " Just about the time they broke up she realized she was pregnant and had an abortion . She 's weighted down with guilt about it . She told me that she keeps dreaming about the baby , that she hears a baby crying and is trying to find it . Said she 'd do anything to have had the baby , even though she would have given it out for adoption . " Katie remembered how much she had hoped to conceive John 's child , how furious she 'd been when after his death someone commented that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life is so crazy , " she said . " The wrong people get pregnant , and then it 's so easy to make a mistake you have to live with for the rest of your life . But that does explain it . Thanks for telling me . I was afraid I 'd said something to hurt her . " " You did n't , " Rita said . She gathered up the files Katie had assigned her . " All right . I 'll serve these subpoenas and hunt for the barber . " After Rita left , Katie leaned back in her chair . She wanted to talk again with Gertrude Fitzgerald and Gana Krupshak . Mrs. Fitzgerald and Edna had been good friends ; they 'd often lunched together . Mrs. Krupshak had frequently dropped into Edna 's apartment at night . Maybe Edna had said something to one of them about Dr. Fukhito and Vangie Lewis . It was worth a try . She called Westlake Hospital and was told that Mrs. Fitzgerald was home ill ; requested and got her home phone number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice was weak and shaking . " I have one of my migraines , Mrs. DeMaio , " she said , " and no wonder . Every time I think of how Edna looked , poor dear ... " " I was going to suggest that we get together either here or at your home , " Katie said . " But I 'll be in court all day tomorrow , so I guess it will have to wait until Monday . There 's just one thing I would like to ask you , Mrs. Fitzgerald . Did Edna ever call either of the doctors she worked for Prince Charming ' ? " " Prince Charming ? " Gertrude Fitzgerald 's voice was astonished . " Prince Charming ? My goodness . Dr. Highley or Dr. Fukhito ? Why would anyone call either of them Prince Charming ? My heavens , no. , , " All right . It was just a thought . " Katie said good-bye and dialed  | Mrs. Krupshak . The superintendent answered . His wife was out , he explained . She 'd be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was four thirty . " Do you think she 'd mind if on my way home I stopped to talk to her for a few minutes ? I promise I wo n't be long . " " Suit yourself , " the man answered shortly , then added , " What 's going on with the Burns apartment ? How long before it gets cleared out ? " " That apartment is not to be entered or touched until this office releases it , " Katie said sharply . She hung up , packed some files in her briefcase and got her coat . She 'd have just enough time to talk to Mrs. Krupshak , then go home and change . She would n't stay late at Molly 's tonight . She wanted one decent night 's sleep before the operation . She knew she would n't sleep well in the hospital . She was just ahead of the evening traffic , and Mrs. Krupshak was home when she rang her bell . " Now , is n't that timing ? " she exclaimed to Katie . The shock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman , and clearly she was beginning to enjoy the excitement of the police investigation . " This is my bingo afternoon , " she explained . " When I told my friends what happened they could hardly keep their cards straight . " Poor Edna , Katie thought , then realized that Edna would have been delighted to be the center of an active discussion . Mrs. Krupshak ushered her into an L-shaped living room , a mirror image of the unit Edna had lived in . Edna 's living room had been furnished with an old-fashioned velour couch , matching straightbacked fireside chairs , a fading Oriental rug . Like Edna , the apartment had had its own innate dignity . The superintendent 's wife had an imitation-leather couch and club chair , an oversized cocktail table topped by an exactly centered plastic flower arrangement and an orange-toned autumnal print over the couch that picked up the wildly vivid shade of the carpeting . Katie sat down . This place is ordinary , she reflected . It 's unimaginative , yet it 's clean and comfortable and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsociable , Gana Krupshak is a happy woman . Then Katie wondered why she was suddenly so concerned with defining happiness . With a mental shrug she turned to the questions she wanted to ask . " Mrs. Krupshak , " she said , " we talked last night , but of course , you were so shocked . Now I wonder if you would go over with me  | very carefully what happened last night : how long were you with Edna ; what did you talk about ; did you get the impression that when she spoke to Captain Lewis she made an appointment with him . " Gana Krupshak leaned back in her chair , looked past Katie , halfclosed her eyes and bit her lip . " Now , let 's see . I went over to Edna 's right at eight o'clock , because Gus started to watch the basketball game and I thought , To hell with the basketball game , I 'll pop over to Edna 's and have a beer with her . " " And you went over there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Edna had made a pitcher of Manhattans and they were about half gone and she was feeling pretty rocky . You know , like , sometimes she 'd get in moods , kind of down , if you know what I mean , and I thought she was in one of those . Like , last Thursday was her mother 's birthday and I stopped in then and she was crying about how much she missed her mother . Now , I do n't mean she 'd take it out on you , no way , but when I popped over there Thursday she was sitting with her folks ' picture in her hands and the jewelry box on her lap and tears rolling down her cheeks . I gave her a big hug and said , Edna , I 'm going to pour you a nice Manhattan and we 'll toast your maw and if she was here she 'd be joining us . ' So if you know what I mean , I kind of kidded her out of the blues and she was fine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather I figured she really was n't over the lonesome spell . " " Did she tell you she was still depressed Tuesday night ? " Katie asked . " No . No . That 's it . She was kind of excited . She talked in a sort of rambly way about this patient who had died , how beautiful she 'd been , like a doll , and how sick she 'd been getting and how she ? Edna , I mean  --  could tell the cops a lot about her . " " Then what happened ? " Katie asked . " Well , I had a Manhattan , or two , with her and then figured I 'd better get home because Gus gets in a snit if I 'm still out when he , goes to bed . But I hated to see Edna drink much more , because I knew she 'd be feeling real bad in the morning , so I got out that nice canned ham and opened it and cut off a few slices for her . " " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I told you last night . " " And she talked to Captain Lewis about Prince Charming ? " " As God is my witness . " " All right , but one last thing , Mrs. Krupshak : do you know if  | Edna kept any articles of clothing of her mother 's as a sentimental keepsake ? " " Clothing ? No . She did have a lovely diamond pin and ring . " " Yes , yes , we found those last night . But  --  well , for example , my mother used to keep her mother 's old black felt hat in her closet for sentimental reasons . I noticed an old moccasin in Edna 's jewelry drawer . It was quite shabby . Did she ever show it to you or mention it ? " Gana Krupshak looked directly at Katie . " Absolutely not , " she said flatly .  | THE NEWSMAKER ARTICLE was on , the stands Thursday morning . The phone calls began as soon as he went to his office after delivering the Aldrich baby . He instructed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the comments . They were beyond his expectations . " Doctor , when can I have an appointment ? My husband and I have longed for a baby . I can fly to New Jersey at your convenience . God bless you for your work . " The Dartmouth Medical School phoned . Would he consider a guest lecture ? An article writer for Ladies ' Home Journal wanted to interview him . Would Dr. Highley and Dr. Fukhito appear together on Eyewitness News ? That request troubled him . He 'd been careful to give the Newsmaker reporter the impression that he worked with a number of psychiatrists , in the same sense a family lawyer might have his clients consult with any one of a dozen counselors . He had clearly suggested that the program was entirely under his control , not a joint effort . But the reporter had picked up Fukhito 's name from a number of the safe patients he 'd given her to interview . Now the reporter credited Fukhito as the psychiatrist who seemed to be primarily involved with Dr. Edgar Highley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by the publicity . That was why he 'd been chosen . Fukhito had to keep his mouth shut even if he ever started to get suspicious . He was in no position to allow a breath of scandal to hit Westlake . He 'd be permanently ruined if that happened .  | Fukhito was becoming a distinct liability . It would be easy enough to get rid of him now . He was giving a lot of time on a voluntary basis to the clinic at Valley Pines . He could undoubtedly become staff there now . Probably Fukhito would be glad to scramble for cover . Then he could start to rotate psychiatrists ; he knew enough of them by now who were n't competent to counsel anyone . They 'd be easy enough to dupe . Fukhito would have to go . The decision made , he signaled for his first patient to come in . She was new , as were the two scheduled after her . The third patient was an interesting case : a womb so tipped that she 'd never be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phone call came at noon just as he was leaving for lunch . The nurse covering the reception desk was apologetic . " Doctor , it 's a long-distance call from a Dr. Emmet Salem in Minneapolis . He 's in a phone booth at the airport now and insists on speaking with you at once . " Emmet Salem ! He picked up the phone . " Edgar Highley here . " " Dr. Highley . " The voice was icy cold . " Dr. Highley from Christ Hospital in Devon ? " " Yes . " A chill , sickening fear made his tongue heavy , his lips rub- , bery . " Dr. Highley , I learned last night that you treated my former patient , Mrs. Vangie Lewis . I 'm leaving for New York immediately . I 'll be at the Essex House Hotel in New York . I must tell you that I am planning to consult with the Medical Examiner in New jersey about Mrs. Lewis ' death . I have her medical records with me . In fairness to you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Doctor , I 'm troubled by your tone and insinuations . " Now he could talk . Now his own voice hardened into chips of granite . " My plane is boarding . I 'll be checking into room 3219 of the Essex House Hotel shortly before five o'clock . You can call me there . " The connection was broken . He was waiting in the Essex House when Emmet Salem emerged from the cab . Swiftly he disappeared into an elevator to the thirtysecond floor , walked past room 3219 until the corridor turned in a right angle . Another elevator stopped at the floor . He listened as a  | key clicked , a bellman said , " Here we are , Doctor . " A minute later the bellman emerged again . " Thank you , sir . " He waited until he heard the elevator stop at the floor for the bellman . The corridors were silent . But that would n't last long . Many of the delegates to the AMA convention were probably staying here . There was always the danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the chance . He had to silence Salem . Swiftly he opened his leather bag and brought out the paperweight that only forty-eight hours ago he had intended to use to silence Edna . Incongruous , impossible  --  that he , the healer , the doctor , was repeatedly forced to kill . He slipped the paperweight into his coat pocket , put on his gloves , grasped the bag firmly in his left hand and knocked on the door . Emmet Salem pulled the door open . He 'd just removed his suit jacket . " Forgot something ? " His voice trailed off . Obviously he 'd expected the bellman had come back . " Dr. Salem ! " He reached for Salem 's hand , walking forward , backing the older man into the room , slipping the door closed behind him . " I 'm Edgar Highley . It 's good to see you again . You got off the phone so abruptly that I could n't tell you I was having dinner with several colleagues who are attending the convention . I have only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear up any questions . " He was still walking forward , forcing the other man to retreat . The window behind Salem was wide open . He 'd probably had the bellman open it . The room was very hot . The window was low . His eyes narrowed . " I tried to phone you , but your extension is out of order . " " Impossible . I just spoke to the operator . " Dr. Salem stiffened , his face suddenly cautious . " Then I do apologize . But no problem . I 'm so anxious to go over the Lewis file with you . I have it in my case here . " He reached for the paperweight in his pocket , then cried , " Doctor , behind you , watch out ! " The other man spun around . Holding the paperweight in his fist , he crashed it on Salem 's skull . The blow sent Emmet Salem staggering . He slumped against the windowsill . Jamming the paperweight back into his pocket , Edgar Highley cupped his palms around Emmet Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . Christ , please ! " The half-conscious man slid out the window .  | He watched dispassionately as Salem landed on the roof of the extension some fifteen floors below . The body made a muffled thud . Had it been seen ? He had to hurry . From Salem 's suit coat on the bed , he pulled out a key ring . The smallest key fitted the attache case on the luggage rack . The Vangie Lewis file was on top . Grabbing it , he shoved it into his own briefcase , relocked Salem 's bag , returned the keys to the suitcoat pocket . He took the paperweight from his pocket and placed it in his own bag with the file . The wound had not spurted blood , but the paperweight was sticky . He closed his own bag and glanced around . The room was in perfect order . There was no trace of blood on the windowsill . It had taken less than two minutes . He opened the door cautiously and looked out . The corridor was empty . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone in Salem 's room began to ring . He did not dare be seen getting on the elevator on this floor . His picture was in the Newsmaker article . Later people might be questioned . He might be recognized . The fire-exit stairway was at the end of the corridor . He descended four levels to the twenty-eighth floor . There he reentered the carpeted corridor . An elevator was just stopping . He got on it , his eyes scanning the faces of the passengers . Several women , a couple of teen-agers , an elderly couple . No doctors . He was sure of that . At the lobby he walked rapidly to the Fifty-eighth Street exit of the hotel , turned west and then south . Ten minutes later he reclaimed his car from the park-and-lock garage on West Fifty-fourth Street , tossed his bag into the trunk and drove away .  | Cmus ARRrVEn at the Twin Cities airport at ten minutes of one . He had an hour to wait before his plane left for Newark . Vangie 's body would be on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of nothing except that coffin in the hold of the plane . He 'd held on to some semblance of normality by reassuring himself that soon it would be over . He had to see Dr. Salem . Why had Dr. Salem been so upset ? Tonight when he got off the plane at Newark , the Medical Examiner 's office would be waiting for Vangie 's body . And the Prosecutor 's office would be waiting for him . The certainty haunted Chris . Of course . If they were suspicious in any way about Vangie 's death , they were going to look to him for answers . They 'd be waiting to bring him in for questioning . They might even arrest him . If they 'd investigated at all , they knew by now that he 'd returned to the New Jersey area Monday night . He had to see Dr. Salem . If he was detained for questioning he might not be able to talk to him . He did not want to talk to the Prosecutor 's office about Dr. Salem . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Molly was Katie DeMaio 's sister ? They were good people , honest people . He should have trusted them , talked to them . He had to talk to someone . He had to talk to Joan .  | His need for her was a hunger . The minute he started to tell the truth , Joan became involved . Joan , who in this sleazy world still held such inviolate principles , was about to be dragged through the mud . He had the phone number of the stewardess with whom she was staying in Florida . Not knowing what he would say , he went to the phone , automatically gave his credit-card number , heard the ring . Kay Corrigan answered . " Kay , is Joan there ? It 's Chris . " Kay knew about him and Joan . Kay 's voice was concerned . " Chris , Joan has been trying to phone you . Tina called from the New York apartment . The Valley County Prosecutor 's office has been around asking all kinds of questions about you two . Joan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 's over at the new apartment now . It does n't have a phone . From there she has to go to the company personnel office in Miami . She wo n't be here till about eight tonight . " " Tell her to stay in and wait till I call her , " Chris said . " Tell her I 've got to talk to her . Tell her . . . " He broke the connection , leaned against the phone and pushed back a dry sob . Oh , God , it was too much , it was all too much . He could n't think . He did n't know what to do . And in a few hours he 'd be in custody , suspected of killing Vangie . . . maybe charged with killing Vangie . No . There was another way . He 'd get the flight into LaGuardia . He could still make it . Then he 'd be in Manhattan and able to see Dr. Salem at almost the same time he reached the hotel . The Prosecutor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight until six o'clock . Maybe Dr. Salem could help him somehow . He barely made the LaGuardia flight . The coach section was full , but he bought a first-class ticket and was able to get on the plane . He did n't worry about his luggage , which was checked through to Newark . On the plane he accepted a drink from the stewardess , waved away the food and listlessly thumbed through Newsmaker magazine . The page opened to SCIENCE AND MEDICINE . His eye caught the headline : " Westlake Maternity Concept Offers New Hope to Childless Couples . " Westlake . He read the first paragraph . " For the past eight years , a small privately owned clinic in New Jersey has been operating a program called the Westlake Maternity Concept which has made it possible for childless women to become pregnant . Named after a prominent New Jersey obstetrician , the program is carried on  | by Dr. Edgar Highley , **25;1200;TOOLONG , who was the son-inlaw of Dr. Franklin Westlake ... " Dr. Edgar Highley . Vangie 's doctor . Funny she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist . " Dr. Fukhito and I talked about Mama and Daddy today . . . he said it was obvious I was an only child . . . . Dr. Fukhito asked me to draw a picture of Mama and Daddy as I visualized them ; it was fascinating . I mean it really was interesting to see how I visualized them . Dr. Fukhito was asking about you , Chris . " " And what did you say , Vangie ? " " That you worshiped me . You do , do n't you , Chris ? I mean underneath that put-downy way you have with me , are n't I your little girl ? " " I 'd rather you thought of yourself as my wife , Vangie . " " See , I ca n't talk with you about anything . You always get nasty . . . . " He wondered if the police had talked to either of Vangie 's doctors . This last month she had looked so ill . He had suggested that she have a consultation . The company doctor would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to suggest someone from Lenox Hill . But of course , Vangie had refused to have a consultation . Then on her own she 'd made an appointment with Dr. Salem . The plane landed at four thirty . Chris hurried through the terminal and hailed a cab . One of the few breaks of this rotten day was that he 'd be ahead of the five-o'clock rush . " The Essex House , please , " he told the driver . It was just two minutes of five when he reached the hotel . He headed for a lobby telephone . " Dr. Emmet Salem , please . " " Thank you , sir . " There was a pause . " That line is busy , sir . " He hung up . At least Dr. Salem was here . At least he 'd have a chance to talk to him . He remembered he 'd written Dr. Salem 's extension in his notebook , opened it and dialed " 3219 . " The phone rang . . . again . . . again . After six rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the line had been busy only a few minutes before , he asked the operator to try it for him . The operator hesitated , spoke to someone , then came back . " Sir , I just gave this message to another party . Dr. Salem checked in , contacted me to say that he expected an important call and be sure to  | reach him and then apparently stepped out . Why do n't you try again in a few minutes ? " " I 'll do that . Thank you . " Irresolutely Chris hung up the phone , walked over to a lobby chair facing the south elevator bank and sat down . The elevators opened and dislodged passengers , filled again , disappeared in a streak of ascending panel lights . One elevator caught his attention . There was something vaguely familiar about someone on it . Dr. Salem ? Quickly he scanned the passengers . Three women , some teen-agers , an elderly couple , a middle-aged man with a turned-up coat collar . No . Not Dr. Salem . At five thirty Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five past six he heard the whispers that ran through the lobby like a flash fire . " Someone jumped from a window . The body spotted on the roof of the extension . " From somewhere along Central Park South the wail of an ambulance and the yip-yip of police cars were frantic explosions of increasing sound . With the certainty of despair , Chris went to the bell captain 's desk . " Who was it ? " he asked . His tone was crisp , authoritative ; suggested he had a right to know . " Dr. Emmet Salem . He was a big shot in the AMA . Room 3219 . " Walking with the measured gait of an automaton , Chris pushed through the revolving door at the Fifty-eighth Street entrance . A cab was cruising from west to east . He hailed it , got in and leaned back in the seat closing his eyes . " LaGuardia , please , " he said ; " the National Airlines terminal . " There was a seven-o'clock flight to Miami . He could just make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to get to Joan , try to make her understand before he was arrested .  | TWELVE-YEAR-OLD JENNIFER threw open the door as Katie came up the walk . " Katie , hi . " Her voice was joyous , her hug sturdy . The two smiled at each other . With her intense blue eyes , dark hair and olive skin , Jennifer was a younger version of Katie . " Hi , Jennie . How do you feel ? " " Okay . But how about you ? I was so worried when Mom told me about your accident . You sure you 're okay now ? " " Let 's put it this way : by next week I 'll be in great shape . " She changed the subject . " Anybody here yet ? " " Everybody . Dr. Richard is here too .... You know what his first question was ? " " No . " " Is Katie here yet ? ' I swear he 's got a case on you , Katie . Mom and Dad think so too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you got a case on him ? " " Jennifer ! " Half laughing , half irritated , Katie started up the short staircase toward the den in the back of the house , then looked back over her shoulder . " Where are the other kids ? " " Mom shipped them off with a baby-sitter to eat at McDonald 's and then to a movie . She said the Berkeley baby would never sleep if the twins were around . " " Good thinking , " Katie murmured . She started down the foyer to the den . After leaving Gana Krupshak , she 'd gone home , showered and changed . She 'd left the house at quarter of seven thinking , Very  | soon Chris Lewis will be in Scott 's office being questioned ... . ' What explanation could he give for not admitting that he was in the New Jersey area Monday night ? Why had n't he volunteered that im-mediately ? She wondered if Richard had spoken to the Minnesota doctor yet . He might have cleared up a lot of questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Driving over , she had resolved to put the case out of her mind for the rest of the evening . Maybe not thinking about it for a while would help her to follow up the elusive threads that kept escaping her She reached the den . Liz and Jim Berkeley were seated on the couch , their backs to her . Molly was passing hors d'oeuvres . Bill and Richard were standing by the window talking . Katie studied Richard . He was wearing a navy blue pin-striped suit that she 'd never seen before . His dark brown hair had touches of gray she 'd never noticed . His fingers on the stem of the glass he was holding were long and finely shaped . Funny how this past year she 'd seen him as a composite , never noticing details . It seemed to her that she was like a camera that had been locked into one position and was just beginning to focus again . Richard looked serious . His forehead was creased . She wondered if he was telling Bill about the Lewis fetus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment Richard turned his head and saw her . " Katie . " His smile matched the pleased tone in his voice . He came hurrying over to her . " I 've been listening for the doorbell . " So often in these three years she 'd entered a room where she was the outsider , the loner , amidst couples . Now here tonight , Richard had been waiting for her , listening for her . Before she had time to consider her feelings , Molly and Bill were saying hello , Jim Berkeley had stood up and the usual confusion of greetings was taking place . On the way to the dining room she did manage to ask Richard if he 'd reached Dr. Salem . " No . Apparently I just missed him at five , " Richard explained . " Then I tried again from my place at six , but there was no answer . I left this number with the hotel operator and with my answering service . I 'm very anxious to hear what that man has to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lewis suicide until dinner was almost over . And then it came about because Liz Berkeley said , " What luck . I have to admit I 've been holding my  | breath that Maryanne would n't wake up and be fussy . Poor kid , her gums are so swollen she 's in misery . " Jim Berkeley laughed . He was darkly handsome with high cheekbones , charcoal-brown eyes and thick black eyebrows . " When Maryanne was born , Liz used to wake her up every fifteen minutes to make sure she was still breathing . But since she 's teething , Liz has become like every other mother . " He imitated her voice , " Quiet , dummy , do n't wake up the baby . " Liz , a Carol Burnett type , with sinewy slenderness , an open , pleasant face and flashing brown eyes , made a face at her husband . " You have to admit I 'm calming down to being normal . But she is a miracle to us . I 'd just about given up hope and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't babies . Especially with the two of us in our late thirties , they told us to forget it . And then Dr. Highley . He 's a miracle maker , that man . " Katie watched as Richard 's eyes narrowed . " You genuinely think that ? " Richard queried . " Positively . I mean , Dr. Highley is n't the warmest person on earth ? " Liz began . " What you mean is that he 's an egocentric son of a bitch and as cold a fish as ever I 've met , " her husband interrupted . " But who gives a damn about that ? ' What matters is that he knows his business , and I have to say he took excellent care of Liz . Put her to bed in the hospital almost two months before the delivery and personally checked on her three or four times a day . " " He does that with all his difficult pregnancies , " Liz said . " Not just me . Listen , I pray for that man every night . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even begin to tell you ! And do n't let this one fool you " ? she nodded in the direction of her husband : " he 's up ten times a night to make sure that Maryanne is covered and that there 's no draft on her . Tell the truth . " She looked at him . " When you went up to the john before , did n't you look in on her ? " He laughed . " Sure I did . " Molly said what Katie was thinking . " That 's the way Vangie Lewis would have felt about her child . " Richard looked at Katie questioningly and she shook her head . She knew he was wondering if she 'd told Molly and Bill that the Lewis baby was Oriental . Deliberately Richard pulled the conversation from Vangie . " I understand that you used to live in San Francisco , " he said to Jim . " I grew up there . In fact , my father still practices at San Francisco General .... "  | " One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back there in a minute , would n't we , Liz ? " As the others chatted , Katie listened with half a mind , contributing enough to the conversation that her silence was n't noticeable . She had so much thinking to do . These few days in the hospital would give her time for that too . She was feeling light-headed and fatigued , but did not want to make a move too soon for fear of breaking up the party . Her chance came as they left the table to go into the living room for a nightcap . " I 'm going to say good night , " Katie said . " I have to admit I have n't slept well this week and I 'm really bushed . " Molly looked at her knowingly and did not protest . Richard said , " I 'll walk you to the car . " " Fine . " The night air was cold , and she shivered as they started down the walk . Richard noticed immediately and said , " Katie , I 'm worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par . You do n't seem to want to talk about it , but at least let 's have dinner tomorrow night . With the way the Lewis case is breaking , the office will be a zoo tomorrow . " " Richard , I 'm sorry . I ca n't . I 'm going away this weekend . " Katie realized her tone was apologetic . " You 're what ? With all that 's happening at the office ? Does Scott know that ? " " I . . . I 'm committed . " What a lame , stupid thing to say , Katie thought . This is ridiculous . I 'm going to tell Richard that I 'll be in the hospital . The driveway lights were on his face , and his expression of mingled disappointment and disapproval was unmistakable . " Richard , it 's not something I 've talked up , but ... " The front door was thrown open . " Richard , Richard ! " Jennifer 's shout was rushed and excited . " Clovis Simmons is on the phone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she the actress on that soap opera ? " " Yes . Oh , hell , I was supposed to call her and forgot . Hold on , Katie . I 'll be right back . " " No . I 'll see you in the morning . You go ahead . " Katie got into the car and pulled the door closed . She fished for the ignition key in her handbag , found it and inserted it into the lock . Richard looked irresolute for an instant , then hurried into the house , listening as Katie 's car drove away . Hell , he thought , of all the times . His " Hello , Clovis " was brusque .  | " Well , Doctor , it 's a shame I have to track you down , but we did discuss dinner , did n't we ? " " Clovis , I 'm sorry . " No , Clovis , he thought , you discussed dinner . I did n't . " Well , obviously it 's too late now . " Her tone was cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted to apologize in case you 'd kept the evening . I should have known better . " Richard glanced at Jennifer , who was standing at his elbow . " Clovis , look , let me call you tomorrow . I ca n't talk very well now. , , There was a sharp click in his ear . Richard hung up the phone slowly . Clovis was angry , but more than that , she was hurt . How much we take people for granted , he thought . Just because I was n't serious about her , I did n't bother to think about her feelings . Tomorrow he could only call and apologize and be honest enough to tell her that there was someone else . Katie . Where was she going this weekend ? Was there someone else for her ? She 'd looked so troubled , so worried . Was it that he 'd been misreading her all along ? He 'd put her reticence , her lack of interest in him to the probability that she was living in the past . Maybe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much a fool about her feelings as in a different way he 'd been with Clovis ? The possibility sheared away the pleasure of the evening . He 'd make his excuses and go home . It still would n't be too late to try Dr. Salem again . He went into the living room . Molly , Bill and the Berkeleys were there . And swathed in blankets , sitting straight up on Liz 's lap , was a baby girl . " Maryanne decided to join the party , " Liz said . " What do you think of her ? " Her smile was proud as she turned the baby to face him . Richard looked into solemn green eyes set in a heart-shaped face . Jim Berkeley was sitting next to his wife , and Maryanne reached over and grabbed his thumb . Richard stared at the family . They might have posed for a magazine cover : the smiling parents , the beautiful offspring . The parents handsome , olive-skinned , brown-eyed , square-featured ; the baby faircomplexioned , red-blond , with brilliant green eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Richard thought . That child has to be adopted .  | PHIL CUNNINGHAM AND Charley Nugent watched in disgust as the final stragglers filed through the waiting room at Newark Airport 's Gate ii . Charley 's perpetually mournful expression deepened . " That 's it . " He shrugged . " Lewis must have figured we 'd be waiting for him . Let 's go . " He headed for the nearest pay phone and dialed Scott . " You can go home , boss , " he said . " The Captain did n't feel like flying tonight . " " He was n't on board ? How about the coffin ? " " That came in . Richard 's guys are picking it up . Want us to hang around ? There are a couple of indirect flights he might be on . " " Forget it . If he does n't contact us tomorrow , I 'm issuing a pickup order for him as a material witness . And first thing in the morning , I want you two to go through Edna Burns 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . He turned to Phil . " If I know the boss , I 'd say that by tomorrow night at this time there 'll be a warrant out for Lewis ' arrest . " Phil nodded . " And after we get Lewis , I hope we can hang something on that shrink if he was the one who made that poor gal pregnant . " The two men wearily started down the stairs to the exit . They passed the baggage area , ignoring the people clustered around the carousels waiting for their luggage . A few minutes later the area was  | deserted . Only one unclaimed bag circled forlornly on the ramp : a large black carryall , properly tagged , in accordance with airline regulations , CAPT . CHRISTOPHER LEwIS , No. 4 , WINDING BROOK LANE , CHAPIN RIVER , N.J. Inside the bag , placed there at the last minute , was the picture Vangie 's parents had pressed on Chris . It was a nighclub photo of a youthful couple . The inscription read , Remembrance of my first date with Vangie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chris .  | RICHARD PHONED THE Essex House Hotel as soon as he reached his apartment after leaving the Kennedys ' . But once again there was no answer on Dr. Salem 's number . When the operator came back on the line , he said , " Operator , did Dr. Salem receive my message to phone me ? I 'm Dr. Carroll . " The woman 's voice was oddly hesitant . " I 'll check , sir . " While he was waiting , Richard reached over and flipped on the television set . Eyewitness News had just begun . The camera was focusing on Central Park South . Richard watched as the marquee of the Essex House Hotel was featured on the screen . Even as the telephone operator said , " I 'm connecting you with our supervisor , " Richard heard reporter Gloria Rojas say , " This evening in the prestigious Essex House Hotel , headquarters for the American Medical Association convention , a prominent **25;1227;TOOLONG , Dr. Emmet Salem of Minneapolis , Minnesota , fell or jumped to his death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay , what time did he say he 'd phone ? " she asked . Her voice trembled , and she bit her lip . The other young woman looked at her with concern . " I told you , Joan . He called about eleven thirty this morning . He said he 'd be in touch with you tonight and that you should wait in for his call . He sounded upset . " The doorbell rang insistently , making them both jump from their chairs . Kay said , " I do n't expect anybody . " Some instinct made Joan run to the door and yank it open . " Chris  --  oh , my God , Chris ! " She threw her arms around him . He was ghastly white , his eyes were bloodshot , he swayed as she held him . " Chris , what is it ? " " Joan , Joan . " His voice was nearly a sob . Hungrily he pulled her to him . " I do n't know what 's happening . There 's something wrong about Vangie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us about it is dead too . "  | HE HAD PLANNED to go directly home from the Essex House , but after he drove out of the parking lot and started up the West Side Highway in the heavy traffic , he changed his mind . He was so terribly hungry . His stomach had been empty all day . He never ate before operating , and this morning the call from Salem had come just before he would have left for lunch . He did n't want to take the time to prepare food tonight . He 'd go to the Carlyle . Then if the question ever arose as to his whereabouts tonight , he could truthfully admit he had been in New York . The maitre d ' would emphatically reassure the police that Dr. Edgar Highley was a valued and frequent patron . He would have smoked salmon , vichyssoise , a rack of lamb .. . His mouth salivated in anticipation . The sudden , terrible depletion of energy now that it was over needed to be corrected . There was still tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . But her former gynecologist had retired and moved away . No one would loom from the past with old medical records to challenge him . And then he 'd be safe . Right now , all over the AMA convention , doctors were probably discussing the Newsmaker article and the Westlake Maternity Concept . Their remarks ' would be tinged with jealousy , of course . But even so , there would be offers for him to speak at future AMA seminars . He was now on the path to public fame . And Salem , who might have stopped him , was finished . He  | was anxious to go through Vangie 's medical history in the file he 'd taken from Salem . He 'd incorporate it with his own records . That history would be invaluable in his future research . The last new patient this morning . She would be next . He parked on the street in front of the Carlyle . It was nearly six thirty . Parking would be legal at seven . He 'd just wait in the car until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . His bag was locked in the trunk . Vangie 's file , the paperweight and the shoe were in it . How should he dispose of the shoe and the paperweight ? Where should he dispose of them ? Any one of the overflowing trash baskets in this city would do . No one would fish them out . They 'd be collected in the morning together with the tons of garbage that accumulated every twenty-four hours in this city of eight million , lost in the smell of decaying food and discarded newspapers ... . He 'd do it on the way home , under cover of darkness , never noticed . A sense of buoyancy at the anticipation of how well it was going made him suddenly straighten up in his seat . He leaned over and looked into the rearview mirror . His skin was glistening , as if with perspiration about to burst through the pores . His eyelids and the skin under his eyes were accumulating fatty tissue . His hairline still showed no sign of receding , but the dark sandy hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age . The subtle change that began in the mid-forties was happening to him . He was forty-five now . Young enough , but also time to become aware of the swift passage of years . Did he want to remarry ? Did he want to father children of his own ? He 'd wanted , expected them from Claire . When they had n't come he 'd checked his own sperm count , found it surprisingly low , secretly blamed himself all those years for Claire 's inability to conceive . Until he learned that she 'd made a fool of him . He would not have minded having a child by Winifred . But she was virtually past childbearing years when they married . After she became suspicious of him , he did n't bother to touch her . When you are planning to eliminate someone , she is already dead to you , and sex is for the living . But now . A younger woman , a woman unlike Claire and Winifred . Claire , haughtily demeaning him with her sneering comments about his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charities . Now he needed a wife who would not only be socially at ease , but also like to entertain , to travel , to mingle .  | He hated those things . He knew his contempt showed . He needed someone who would take care of all that for him , soften his image . One day he would be able to carry out his work publicly . One clay he would have the fame he deserved . One day the fools who said his work was impossible would be forced to acknowledge his genius . It was seven o'clock . He got out of the car and carefully locked it . He walked to the entrance of the Carlyle , his dark blue suit covered by a blue cashmere coat , his shoes shined to a soft luster , his silvertipped hair unruffled by the biting night drafts . The doorman held the door open for him . " Good evening , Dr. Highley . Pretty bad weather , is n't it , sir ? " He nodded without answering and went into the dining room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ' quickly switched the expected diners to another table and led him to it . Wine warmed and soothed him . The dinner gave him the strength he was anticipating . The demitasse and brandy restored him to total balance . His mind was clear and brittle . He reviewed each step of the procedure that would lead Katie DeMaio to death by hemorrhage . There would be no mistakes . He was just signing his check when the maitre d ' came to his table , his footsteps uncharacteristically hurried , his manner agitated . " Dr. Highley , I 'm afraid there 's a problem . " His fingers gripped the pen . He looked up . " It 's just , sir , that a young man was observed prying the trunk of your car . The doorman saw him just as he got it open . Before he could be stopped , he had stolen a bag from the trunk . The police are outside . They believe it was a drug addict who chose your car because of the MD license plates . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like an X-ray machine he mentally examined the contents of the bag : the bloodstained paperweight ; the medical file with both Vangie and Salem 's names on it ; Vangie 's moccasin . When he spoke , his voice was surprisingly steady . " Do the police believe that my bag will be recovered ? " " I asked that question , sir . I 'm afraid they just do n't know . It might be discarded a few blocks from here after he 's taken what he wants from it , or it might never show up again . Only time will tell . "  | BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED , Katie packed an overnight bag for her stay in the hospital . The hospital was halfway between the house and the office , and it would have been an unnecessary waste of time to return home for the bag tomorrow . She realized that she was packing with a sense of urgency . She 'd be so glad to get this over with . The heavy sense of being physically out of tune was wearing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoyant setting out for Molly 's . Now she felt depleted , exhausted , depressed . It was all physical , was n't it ? Or was the nagging thought that maybe Richard was involved with someone contributing to the feeling of depression ? Maybe when this was n't hanging over her , she 'd be able to think more clearly . It felt as though her mind were being plagued by halfcompleted thoughts like swarms of mosquitoes , landing , biting , but gone before she could reach them . Why did she have the sensation of missing threads , of not asking the right questions , of misreading signals ? By Monday she 'd be feeling better , thinking straight . Wearily , she showered , brushed her teeth and hair and got into bed . A minute later she pulled herself up on one elbow , reached for her handbag and fished out the small bottle Dr. Highley had given her . Almost forgot to take this , she thought as she swallowed the pill with a gulp from the water glass on her night table . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERTRUDE FITZGERALD wearily let the water run cold in the bathroom tap and opened the prescription bottle . The migraine was beginning to let up . If it did n't start in on the other side of her head , she 'd be all right by the morning . This last pill should do it . Something was bothering her . . . something over and beyond Edna 's death . It had to do with Mrs. DeMaio 's call . It was so silly , asking if Edna had ever called Dr. Fukhito or Dr. Highley Prince Charming . Perfect nonsense . But Prince Charming . Edna had talked about him . Not in relation to the doctors , but somehow in the last couple of weeks . If she could only remember . If Mrs. DeMaio had asked if Edna had ever mentioned him , it might have helped her remember right away . Now it was eluding her , the exact circumstance . Or was she imagining it ? Power of suggestion . When this headache was finished , she 'd be able to think . Really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into bed . She closed her eyes . Edna 's voice sounded in her ears . " And I said that Prince Charming wo n't . . " She could n't remember the rest .  | AT FOUR A.M. RICHARD gave up trying to sleep , got out of bed and made coffee . He had phoned Scott at home about Emmet Salem 's death , and Scott had immediately alerted the New York police that his office wanted to cooperate in the investigation . More than that it had been impossible to accomplish . Mrs. Salem was not at home in Minneapolis . The doctor 's answering service could only supply the emergency number of the doctor covering the practice and did not know how to reach his nurse . Richard began writing notes . 1 . Why did Dr. Salem phone our office ? 2 . Why did Vangie make an appointment with him ? 3 . The Berkeley baby . The Berkeley baby was the key . Was the Westlake Maternity Concept as successful as had been touted ? Or was it a cover-up for private adoptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry babies to term ? Was the fact that they were being put to bed in the hospital two months before the supposed delivery nothing but a cover-up for what would become an obvious nonpregnant con-dition ? Babies were hard to adopt . Liz Berkeley had openly admitted that she and her husband had tried that route . Suppose Edgar Highley had said to them , " You 'll never have your own child . I can get you a child . It will cost you money and it will have to be absolutely confidential . " They 'd have gone along with it . He 'd stake his life on that .  | But Vangie Lewis had been pregnant . So she did n't fit into the adoptive pattern . Granted she was desperate to have a child . . . but how the hell did she expect to pass off an Oriental baby on her husband ? Was there any chance that there was Oriental blood in either family ? He 'd never considered that . The malpractice suits . He had to find out the reason those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . His office would have her medical records . That would be a place to start . Vangie 's body had come back on the plane that Chris Lewis did not take . It was in the lab now . First thing in the morning he 'd review the autopsy findings . He 'd go over the body again . There was something ... It had seemed unimportant at the time . He 'd brushed over it . He 'd been too involved with the fetus and the cyanide bums . Could Vangie have simply spilled the cyanide on herself ? Maybe she 'd been frantically nervous . But the glass would have had more prints . She 'd have picked it up , refilled it ; there 'd be something  --  an envelope , a vial  --  that she 'd have used to hold more cyanide . It had n't happened like that . At five thirty Richard turned out the light . He set the alarm for seven . At last sleep came . And he dreamed of Katie . She was standing behind Edna Burns 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching her .  | As sirs BOOKKEEPER , Edna had kept meticulous records . When the search team headed by Phil Cunningham and Charley Nugent descended on her apartment on Friday morning , they found a simple statement in the old-fashioned breakfront ; Since my one blood relative never bothered to inquire about or send a card to my dear parents in their illness , I have decided to leave my worldly goods to my friends , Mrs. Gertrude Fitzgerald and Mrs. Gana Krupshak . Mrs. Fitzgerald is to receive my diamond ring and whatever household possessions she cares to have . Mrs. Krupshak is to receive my diamond pin , my imitation fur coat and whatever household possessions Mrs. Fitzgerald does not wish to have . I have discussed my funeral with the establishment that handled my parents ' arrangements so beautifully . My $1o,000 insurance policy less funeral expenses is assigned to the nursing home which took such fine care of my parents and to whom I am still financially indebted . Methodically the team dusted for fingerprints , vacuumed for hair and fibers , searched for signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the windowsill plant in the bedroom caused the crinkles around Phil 's eyes and forehead to settle into a deep frown . He went around the back of the apartment building , thoughtfully scraped a sample of frozen dirt into an envelope and with his fingertips pushed  | up the bedroom window . For an average-sized person , it was low enough to step over . " Possible , " he said to Charley . " Someone could have come in here and sneaked up on her . But with the ground so frozen , you 'd probably never be able to prove it . " As the final step , they rang the doorbells of all the neighbors in the courtyard . The question was simple : had anyone noticed any strangers in the vicinity on Tuesday night ? They had not really expected success . Tuesday night had been dark and cold . The untrimmed shrubbery would have made it possible for anyone who did not want to be seen to stay in the shadows of the building . But at the last apartment they had unexpected success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch . He heard the question asked of his mother . " Oh , I told a man which apartment Miss Bums lived in , " he reported . " You remember , Ma , when you made me walk Porgy just before I went to bed , right after Happy Days ... " " That would be at nine thirty , " the boy 's mother said . " You did n't tell me you spoke to anyone , " she said accusingly to her son . The boy shrugged . " It was no big deal . A man parked at the curb just when I was coming back down the block . He asked me if I knew which apartment Miss Bums was in . I pointed it out . That 's all . " " What did he look like ? " Charley asked . The boy frowned . " Oh , he was nice-looking . He had sort of dark hair and he was tall and his car was neat . It was a ' Vette . " Charley and Phil looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ON FRIDAY MORNING , Katie got into the office by seven o'clock and began a final review of the case she was trying . The defendants were eighteen- and seventeen-year-old brothers accused of vandalizing two schools by setting fires in twelve classrooms . Maureen came in at eight thirty carrying a steaming coffeepot . Katie looked up . " Boy , I 'm going all out to nail those two , " she said . " They did it for kicks  --  for kicks . When you see the way people are struggling to pay taxes to keep up the schools their kids go to , it 's sickening ; it 's more than a crime . " Maureen reached for Katie 's coffee cup and filled it . " One of those schools is in my town , and the children next door go there . The tenyear-old had just finished a project for the science fair . It was fantastic  --  a solar heating unit . Poor little kid worked on it for months . It got burned in the fire . There was just nothing left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her opening statement . " That gives me some extra ammunition . Thanks . " " Katie . . . " Maureen 's voice was hesitant . Katie looked up into troubled green eyes . " Yes ? " " Rita told me that she told you about . . . about the baby . " " Yes , she did . I 'm terribly sorry , Maureen . " " The thing is I ca n't seem to get over it . And now this Vangie Lewis case . . . all the talk about that ... only brings it back . I 've been trying to forget .... " Katie nodded . " Maureen , I 'd have given anything to have had a  | baby when john died . That year I prayed I 'd get pregnant so I 'd have something of him . When I think of all the friends I have who elect never to have children or who have an abortion as casually as they have their hair set , I wonder about the way life works out . I just pray God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will too , of course , and we 'll both appreciate them because of not having the ones we wanted before . " Maureen 's eyes were filled with tears . " I hope so . But the thing about the Vangie Lewis case is ? " The telephone rang . Katie reached for it . It was Scott . " Glad you 're in , Katie . Can you run over here for a minute ? " " Of course . " Katie got up . " Scott wants me now . We 'll talk later , Maureen . " Impulsively she hugged the girl . Scott was standing by the window staring out . Katie was sure he was not seeing the barred windows of the county jail . He turned when she came in . " You 're on trial today  --  the Odendall brothers ? " " Yes . We have a good case . " " How long will it take ? " " Most of the day , I 'm sure . They 're bringing character witnesses from their kindergarten teacher on up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Katie . Have you heard about Dr. Salem yet ? " " You mean the doctor from Minneapolis who called Richard ? No , I have n't spoken to anyone this morning . I went straight to my office . " " He fell  --  or was pushed  --  out a window in the Essex House last night a few minutes after he checked into the hotel . We 're working with the New York police on it . And incidentally , Vangie Lewis ' body arrived from Minneapolis last night , but Lewis was n't on the flight . " Katie stared at Scott . " What are you saying ? " " I 'm saying that he probably took the flight that went into LaGuardia . It would have gotten him into New York about the time Salem checked in . I 'm saying that if we find he was anywhere in the vicinity of that hotel , we may be able to wrap this case up . I do n't like the Lewis suicide , I do n't like the Edna Burns accidental death and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " " I do n't believe Chris Lewis is a murderer , " Katie said flatly . " Where do you think he is now ? " Scott shrugged . " Hiding out in New York , probably . My guess is  | that when we talk to his girlfriend she 'll lead us to him , and she 's due in from Florida tonight . Can you hang around this evening ? " Katie hesitated . " This is the one weekend I have to be away . It 's something I ca n't change . But I 'll be honest , Scott . I feel so absolutely lousy that I 'm not even thinking straight . I 'll get through this trial . . . I 'm well prepared ; but then I will leave . " Scott studied her . " I 've told you all week that you should n't have come in , " he said , " and right now you look paler than you did Tuesday morning . All right , get the trial over with and clear out of here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . We 'll go over everything Monday morning . You think you 'll be in ? " " Positively . " " You should have a complete checkup . " " I 'm going to see a doctor this weekend . " " Good . " Scott looked down at his desk , a signal that the meeting was over . Katie went back to her own office . It was nearly nine , and she was due in the courtroom . Mentally she reviewed the schedule of the pills Dr. Highley had given her . She 'd taken one last night , one at six o'clock this morning . She was supposed to take one every three hours today . She 'd better swallow one now before going down to court . She washed it down with the last sip of coffee from the cup on her desk , then gathered her file . The sharp edge of the top page of the brief slit her finger . She gasped at the quick thrust of pain and popping a tissue from her top drawer wrapped it around the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as with the rest of the people in the courtroom , she rose to acknowledge the entrance of the judge , the tissue was still wet with blood .  | EDNA BURNS WAS BURIED on Friday morning after an eleveno'clock Mass of the Resurrection of St. Francis Xavier Church . Gana Krupshak and Gertrude Fitzgerald followed the coffin to the nearby cemetery and , holding hands tightly , watched Edna placed in the grave with her parents . The priest , Father Durkin , conducted the final ceremony , sprinkled holy water over the coffin and escorted them back to Gertrude 's car . " Will you ladies join me for a cup of coffee ? " he asked . Gertrude dabbed at her eyes and shook her head . " I really have to get to work , " she said . " I 'm taking Edna 's place until they find a new receptionist , and the doctors both have office hours this afternoon . " Mrs. Krupshak also declined . " But Father , if you 're on your way back to the rectory , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her way . " " Of course . " Gana turned to Gertrude . Impulsively she said , " Why do n't you come by for dinner with us tonight ? I have a nice pot roast I 'm cooking . " The thought of going back to her own solitary apartment had been upsetting Gertrude , and she quickly accepted the offer . It would be good to talk about Edna tonight with the other person who 'd been her friend . She wanted to express to Gana what a crying shame it was that neither of the doctors had come to the Mass , although at least Dr. Fukhito had sent flowers . Maybe talking it out  | with Gana would help her to think clearly and she 'd be able to get a handle on that thought which kept buzzing around inside her head ? about something that Edna had said to her . She said good-bye to Gana and Father Durkin , got into her car , turned on the ignition and released the brake . Dr. Highley 's face loomed in her mind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been nice enough to her Tuesday night , giving her the pill to calm her down and what-have-you . But there was something funny about him that night . Like when he went to get her a drink of water , she 'd started to follow him . She did n't want him waiting on her . He 'd turned on the water tap , then gone into the bedroom . From the hall she 'd seen him take out his handkerchief and start to open Edna 's night table drawer . Then that nice Dr. Carroll had started to walk down the hall and Dr. Highley had closed the drawer , stuffed the handkerchief in his pocket and backed up so it looked like he was just standing in the bedroom doorway . Gertrude had let Dr. Carroll pass her , then slipped back into the living room . She did n't want them to think she was trying to overhear what they were saying . But if Dr. Highley wanted something from that drawer , why did n't he just say so and get it ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief over his fingers ? Certainly he did n't think Edna 's apartment was too dirty for him to touch . Why , it was immaculate ! Dr. Highley always was a strange man . Truth to tell , like Edna , she 'd always been a little afraid of him . No way would she agree to take over Edna 's job if it was offered to her . Her mind decided on that point , Gertrude steered the car off the cemetery road and onto Forest Avenue .  | THE LIFELESS BODY OF Vangie Lewis was placed on the slab in the autopsy room of the Valley County Medical Examiner . His face impassive , Richard watched as his assistant removed the silk caftan that was to have been Vangie 's burial robe . What had seemed soft and natural in the gentle light of the funeral parlor now resembled a department-store mannequin , features with a total absence of life . Vangie 's blond hair had been carefully coiffed to flow loose on her 1 shoulders . Now the hair spray had begun to harden , separating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that St. Francis Borgia had given up a life at court and entered a monastery after viewing the decaying body of a once-beautiful queen . Sharply , he pulled his mind to the medical problem at hand . He had missed something about Vangie 's body on Tuesday afternoon . He was sure of that . It had something to do with her legs or feet . He would concentrate his attention there . Fifteen minutes later he found what he was seeking : a two-inch scratch on Vangie 's left foot . He had dismissed it because he 'd been so involved with the cyanide burns and the fetus . That scratch was fresh . There was no sign of healing skin . That was what had bothered him . Vangie 's foot had been scratched shortly before her death , and Charley had found a piece of the cloth from the dress she was wearing when she died protruding from a sharp implement in the garage . Richard turned to his assistant . " The lab is supposed to be  | finished with the clothes Mrs. Lewis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them and dress her in them again . Call me when she 's ready . " Back in his office , he scribbled on a pad : Shoes Vangie was wearing when found . Sensible walking shoes , cut fairly high on sides . Could not have been wearing them when foot was scratched . He began to examine the notes he 'd made during the night . The Berkeley baby . He was going to talk to Jim Berkeley , get him to admit that the baby was adopted . But what would that prove ? Nothing of itself , but it would begin the investigation . Once that admission was made , the whole Westlake Maternity Concept would be exposed as a gigantic fraud . Would anyone kill to prevent that fraud from being exposed ? He needed to see Dr. Salem 's medical records on Vangie Lewis . By now , Scott must have reached Dr. Salem 's office . Quickly , he dialed Scott . " Have you spoken to Salem 's nurse ? " " Yes , and also to his wife . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of high blood pressure or dizziness . No personal problems , no money problems , a full schedule of lecturing for the next six months . So I say , forget both the suicide and the accidental-fall angles . " " How about Vangie Lewis ? What did the nurse know ? " " Dr. Salem asked her to get out Vangie 's file yesterday morning in his office . Then , just before he left for his plane , he made a long-distance phone call . " " That might have been the one to me . " " Possibly . But the nurse said that he told her he had other longdistance calls to make , but he 'd use his credit card from the airport after he checked in for his flight . Apparently he had a thing about getting to the airport with a lot of time to spare . " " Is she sending Vangie 's file to us ? I want to see it . " " No , she 's not . " Scott 's voice hardened . " Dr. Salem took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attache case . That case was found in his room . But the Lewis file was n't in it . And get this : After Dr. Salem left , Chris Lewis phoned his office . Said he had to talk to Salem . The nurse told him where Dr. Salem would be staying in New York , even to giving him the room number . I 'll tell you something , Richard : by the end of the day I expect to be swearing out a warrant for Lewis ' arrest . "  | " You mean you think there was something in that file that Chris Lewis would kill to get ? I find that hard to believe . " " Someone wanted that file , " Scott said . " That 's pretty obvious , is n't it ? " Richard hung up the phone . Someone wanted the file . The medical file . Who would know what was in it that might be threatening ? A doctor . Was Katie right in her suspicions about the psychiatrist ? What about Edgar Highley ? He 'd come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name respected in New Jersey medical circles . Impatiently , Richard searched on his desk for the slip of paper Marge had given him with the names of the two patients who had filed malpractice suits against Edgar Highley . Anthony Caldwell , Old Country Lane , Peapack . Anna Horan , 415 Walnut Street , Ridgefield Park . Turning on the intercom , he asked Marge to try to phone both people . Marge came in a few minutes later . " Anthony Caldwell is no longer at that address . He moved to Michigan last year . I got a neighbor on the phone . She told me that his wife died of a tubal pregnancy and that he filed suit against the doctor , but it was dismissed . She was anxious to talk about it . Said Mrs. Caldwell had been told by two other doctors that she 'd never conceive , but that as soon as she started the Westlake Maternity Concept program she became pregnant . But she was terribly sick all the time and finally died in her fourth month . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard said . " We 're going to subpoena all the hospital records . What about Mrs. Horan ? " " I caught her husband home . He 's a law student at Rutgers . Says she 's working as a computer programmer . Gave me her phone number at the job . Shall I get her for you now ? " " Yes , please . " Marge picked up Richard 's phone , dialed and asked for Mrs. Anna Horan . A moment later , she said , " Mrs. Horan , one moment please . Dr. Carroll is calling . " Richard took the phone . " Mrs. Horan . " " Yes . " There was a lilting inflection in her voice , an accent he could not place . " Mrs. Horan , you filed a malpractice suit last year against Dr.  | Edgar Highley . I wonder if I might ask you some questions about that case . Are you free to talk ? " The voice on the other phone became agitated . " No . . . not here . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for you to stop by my office after work today and talk with me ? " " Yes ... all right . " Clearly , the woman wanted to get off the phone . Richard gave the office address and offered directions , but was interrupted . " I know how to get to you .... I 'll be there by five thirty . " The connection was broken . Richard looked at Marge and shrugged . " She 's not happy about it , but she 's coming in . " It was nearly noon . Richard decided to go  --  to the courtroom where Katie was trying the Odendall case and see if she 'd have lunch with him . He wanted to ventilate his thoughts about Edgar Highley . Katie had interviewed him . What had her reaction been ? Would she agree that maybe there was something wrong about the Westlake Maternity Concept  --  either a baby ring or a doctor who took criminal chances with his patients ' lives ? When he got to the courtroom , it was deserted except for Katie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her notes , she barely looked up when he came over to her . At his suggestion of lunch , she shook her head . " Richard , I 'm up to my eyes in this . Those skunks have retracted their confession . Now they 're trying to say someone else set the fires , and they 're such convincing liars I swear the jury is falling for it . I 've got to work on the cross-examination . " Her eyes went back to her notes . Richard studied her . Her usually olive skin was deadly pale . Her eyes when she 'd looked up at him had been heavy and clouded . He noticed the tissue wrapped around her finger . Gently , he reached over and unwound it . Katie looked up . " What . . . oh , that darn thing . It must be deep . It 's been bleeding off and on all morning . I needed that . " Richard studied the cut . Released from the tissue , it began to flow rapidly . Pressing the tissue over the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the cut . " Leave this on for about twenty minutes . That should stop it . Have you been having any clotting problems , Katie ? "  | " Yes , some . But oh , Richard , I ca n't talk about it now . This case is running away from me and I feel so lousy . " Her voice broke . The courtroom was empty except for the two of them . Richard reached down and put his arms around her . He hugged her head against his chest and put his lips on her hair . " Katie , I 'm going to clear out now . But wherever you go this weekend , do some thinking . Because I 'm throwing my hat in the ring . I want you . I want to take care of you . If there 's someone you 're seeing now , tell him he 's got stiff competition , because whoever he is , he 's not watching out for you . If it 's the past that 's holding you , I 'm going to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now go ahead and win your case . You can do it . And for God 's sake , take it easy this weekend . Monday , I 'm going to need your input on an angle I see developing in the Lewis case . " All morning she 'd felt so cold  --  so desperately , icy cold . Even the long-sleeved wool dress had n't helped . Now , so close to Richard , the warmth of his body communicated itself to her . As he turned to leave , she impulsively grasped his hand and held it against her face . " Monday , " she said . " Monday , " he agreed , and left the courtroom .  | BEFORE THEY LEFT the garden apartment complex where Edna had lived , Charley and Phil rang the Krupshaks ' doorbell . Gana had just returned from the funeral . " We 're finished with our investigation in the apartment , " Charley told her . " You 're free to enter it . " He showed her the note Edna had left . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that stuff is n't worth a thousand dollars , so my guess is that we 'll return that jewelry to you , and you and Mrs. Fitzgerald can divide it and the furniture . At least , you can look it over and decide it between yourselves ; but do n't remove anything yet . " The two investigators returned to the office and went directly to the lab , where they turned in the contents of the vacuum bag , the plant that had been on the windowsill and the traces of earth they had removed from the ground . " Run these through right away , " Phil directed . " This stuff gets top priority . " Scott was waiting for them in his office . At the news that Chris had been in the vicinity of Edna 's apartment on Tuesday night , he grunted with satisfaction . " Lewis seems to have been all over the map this week , " he said , " and wherever he 's been someone has died . I sent Rita over to New York this morning with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being in the lobby of the Essex House around five o'clock . I 'm putting out an APB for him and swearing out a warrant for his arrest "  | The phone rang . Impatiently , he reached for it and identified himself . Then his expression changed . " Put her on , " he said quickly . Holding his hand over the speaker , he said , " Chris Lewis ' girlfriend is calling from Florida . . . Hello , yes , this is the Prosecutor . " He paused . " Yes , we are looking for Captain Lewis . Do you know where he is ? " Charley and Phil exchanged glances . Scott 's forehead furrowed as he listened . " Very well . He 'll be on the plane with you arriving in Newark at seven P.M. I 'm very glad to know that he 's surrendering voluntarily . If he wishes to consult with a lawyer , he may want to have one here . Thank you . " He hung up the phone . " Lewis is coming in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . "  | THROUGH THE LONG , sleepless night , Edgar Highley rationalized the problem of the stolen bag . It might never show up . If it had been abandoned after the thief went through it , the odds were he 'd never see it again . Few people would take the trouble to try to return it . More than likely they 'd simply keep the bag and throw out the contents . Suppose the bag were recovered intact by the New York police ? His name and the address of the hospital were inside it . If the police phoned him , they 'd probably ask for a list of the contents . He 'd simply mention some standard drugs , a few instruments and several patients ' files . A medical file with the name VANGIE LEWIS on the tab would mean nothing to them . They probably would n't bother to study it . They 'd just assume it was his . If they asked about the shoe and the bloodstained paperweight , he would deny any knowledge of them ; he 'd point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be all right . And tonight the last risk would be removed . At five A.M. he gave up trying to sleep ; showered , standing under the hot needle spray nearly ten minutes until the bathroom was filled with steam ; wrapped himself in a heavy ankle-length robe and went down to the kitchen . He was not going in to the office until noon , and he 'd make his hospital rounds just before that . Until then , he 'd go over his research notes . Yesterday 's patient would be his new experiment . But he had n't yet chosen the donor .  | AT Four o'CLocK , Richard , Scott , Charley and Phil studied the body of Vangie Lewis , now dressed in the clothes in which she had died . The scrap of flowered material that had been found on the prong in the garage exactly fitted the tear near the hem of her dress . The panty hose on her left foot showed a two-inch slash directly over the fresh cut . " No trace of blood on the hosiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her foot caught on the prong . " " How high was the shelf that prong was on ? " Scott asked . Phil shrugged . " About two feet from the floor . " " Which means that someone carried Vangie Lewis in through the garage , laid her on her bed and tried to give the appearance of a suicide , " Scott said . " Without question , " Richard agreed . But he was frowning . " How tall is Chris Lewis ? " he asked . Scott shrugged . " He 's a big one . Maybe six feet four . Why ? " " Let 's try something . Wait a minute . " Richard left the room , returning with a ruler . Carefully , he marked the wall at heights of two , three and four feet from the floor . " If we assume Chris Lewis was the one who carried Vangie in , I suggest that she would not have been scratched by that prong . " He turned to Phil . " You 're sure the shelf was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within an inch . " Charley nodded in agreement . " All right . I 'm six feet two . " Gently , Richard put one arm under  | the dead woman 's neck , the other under her knees . Picking her up , he walked over to the wall . " Look where her foot touches . She was small . It would n't have been grazed by any object lower than three feet on the shelf if she was carried by a tall man . On the other hand . . . " He walked over to Phil . " How tall are you . . . About five feet ten ? " " Just about . " " All right . Chris Lewis has over six inches on you . Take her and see where her foot falls when you hold her . " Gingerly , Phil accepted the body and walked by the wall . Vangie 's foot trailed against the first mark Richard had made . Quickly , Phil laid her back on the slab . Scott shook his head . " Inconclusive . Impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold her away from him . " He turned to the attendant . " We 'll want those clothes as evidence . Take good care of them . Get some photos of the cut , the stocking and the dress . " He walked with Richard back to his office . " You 're still thinking about the psychiatrist , are n't you ? " he asked . " He 's about five ten . " Richard hesitated and decided not to say anything until he had spoken with Jim Berkeley and the woman patient who had pressed the malpractice suit . He changed the subject . " How 's Katie doing ? " Scott shook his head . " Hard to say . Those bums are blaming the vandalism on one of their friends who was killed on his motorcycle last November . Their new story is they took the rap for him because they felt sorry for his folks , but now their minister has persuaded them for the sake of their own family they have to tell the truth . " Richard snorted . " The jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott said , " It 's out now . Listen , no matter how hard you try to pick your jury , there 's always one bleeding-heart on it who will fall for a sob story . Katie 's done a great job , but it could go either way . Okay . I 'll see you later . " At four thirty , Jim Berkeley returned Richard 's call . " I understand you 've been trying to reach me . " His voice was guarded . " Yes . " Richard matched the other man 's impersonal tone . " It 's important that I speak with you . Can you stop in my office on your way home ? " " Yes , I can . " Now Jim 's voice became resigned . " And I think I know what you want to talk about . "  | EDGAR HIGHLEY turned from the girl on the examining table . " You may get dressed now . " She had claimed to be twenty , but he was sure she was n't more than sixteen or seventeen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are very definitely pregnant . About five weeks , I should think . I want you to return tomorrow morning and we will terminate the pregnancy . " " I was wondering : do you think I should maybe have the baby and have it adopted ? " " Have you told your parents about this ? " " No . They 'd be so upset . " " Then I suggest you postpone motherhood for several years at least . Ten o'clock tomorrow . " He left the room , went into his office and looked up the phone number of the new patient he had chosen yesterday . " Mrs. Englehart , this is Dr. Highley . I want to begin your treatment . Kindly come to the hospital tomorrow morning at eight thirty and prepare to spend the night . "  | WHILE THE JURY WAS DELIBERATING , Katie went into the courthouse cafeteria . She carefully chose a small table at the end of the room and sat with her back to the other tables . She did not want anyone to either join or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt fatigued and weak , but not hungry . Just a cup of tea , she thought . Mama always thought that a cup of tea would cure all the ills of the world . She remembered coming back to the house from John 's funeral , her mother 's voice concerned , gentle : " I 'll make you a nice hot cup of tea , Katie . " Richard . Mama would love Richard . She always liked big men . " Your dad was a skinny little one , but oh , Katie , did n't he seem like a big man ? " Yes , he did . Mama was coming up for Easter . That was just six weeks from now . Mama would be so delighted if she and Richard got together . I do want that , do n't I ? Katie thought as she sipped the tea . It 's not just because I 'm so aware of loneliness this week . It was more than that . Much more . But this weekend in the hospital , she 'd be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat for nearly an hour , absently sipping the tea , reviewing every step of her summation . Had she convinced the jury that the Odendall boys were lying ? The minister . She 'd scored there . He 'd agreed that neither boy was a churchgoer ; that neither boy had ever consulted him for any reason before . Was it possible that he was  | being used by them to bolster their story ? " Yes , " he agreed . " It is possible . " She had made that point . She was sure of it . At five o'clock she returned to the courtroom . As she entered , the jury sent word to the judge that it had reached a verdict . Five minutes later , the foreman announced the verdict : " Robert Odendall , not guilty on all counts . Jonathan Odendall , not guilty on all counts . " " I do n't believe it . " Katie was n't sure if she had spoken aloud . The judge 's face hardened into angry lines . He dismissed the jury curtly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lucky , " he snapped , " luckier than I hope you 'll ever be again in either of your lives . Now clear out of my courtroom , and if you 're smart you 'll never appear before me again . " Katie stood up . No matter if the judge clearly felt the verdict was erroneous , she had lost the case . She should have done more . She felt rather than saw the victorious smile the defense attorney shot at her . A thick , hard lump burned in her throat , making it impossible to swallow . She was within inches of tears . Those two criminals were about to be released on the streets after flouting justice . A dead boy had been labeled a criminal . She stuffed her notes into her briefcase . Maybe if she had n't felt so lousy all week she 'd have conducted a better case . Maybe if she 'd had this hemorrhaging problem taken care of a year ago instead of delaying and putting it off with this crazy , childish fear of hospitals , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will the State please approach the bench ? " She looked up . The ' judge was beckoning to her . She walked over to him . The spectators were filing out . She could hear delighted squeals as the Odendalls embraced their gum-chewing , braless girlfriends . " Your Honor . " Katie managed to keep her voice steady . The judge leaned over and whispered to her : " Do n't let it get you down , Katie . You proved that case . Those little bastards will be back here in two months on other charges . We both know it , and next time you 'll nail them . " Katie tried to smile . " That 's just what I 'm afraid of , that they will be back . God knows how much damage they 'll be doing before we can nail them . But thanks , Judge . " She left the courtroom and went back to her office . Maureen looked up hopefully . Katie shook her head and watched the expression change to sympathy . She shrugged . " What can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office . " Mr. Myerson and Dr. Carroll are in a meeting . They do n't want to be disturbed . But of course , you can go in . " " No . I 'm sure it 's the Lewis case , and I 'd be of no use to them or anyone else right now . I 'll catch up on Monday . " " All right . Katie , I 'm sorry about the Odendall verdict , but try not to take it so hard . You really look sick . Are you all right to drive ? You 're not dizzy or anything ? " " No , really , and I 'm not going far . I 'll be driving just fifteen minutes and then I wo n't budge till Sunday . " As she walked to the car , Katie shuddered . The temperature had gotten up to about forty degrees in the afternoon , but was dropping rapidly again . The wet , damp air penetrated the loose sleeves of her red wool wraparound coat and pierced her nylon hose . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How great it would be to be able to go there now , to just go to bed with a hot toddy and sleep the weekend away . At the hospital , the admitting office had her completed forms waiting . The clerk was briskly bright . " My goodness , Mrs. DeMaio , you certainly rate . Dr. Highley has given you the bedroom of Suite One on the third floor . That 's like going on a vacation . You 'll never dream you 're in a hospital . " " He said something about that , " Katie murmured . She was not about to confide her fear of hospitals to this woman . " You may be a bit lonesome up there . There are just three suites on that floor , and the other two are empty . And Dr. Highley is having the living room of your suite redecorated . Why , I do n't know . It was done less than a year ago . But anyhow , you wo n't need it . You 'll only be here till Sunday . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buzzer . The second-floor nursing station takes care of both the second- and third-floor patients . They 're all Dr. Highley 's patients anyhow . Now , here 's your wheelchair . If you 'll just get into it , we 'll whisk you upstairs . " Katie stared in consternation . " You do n't mean I have to use a wheelchair now ? " " Hospital regulations , " the admitting clerk said firmly . John in a wheelchair going up for chemotherapy . John 's body shrinking as she watched him die . John 's voice weakening , his wry , tired humor as the wheelchair was brought to his bed : " Swing low ,  | sweet chariot , coming for to carry me home . " The antiseptic hospital smell . Katie sat down in the chair and closed her eyes . There was no turning back . The attendant , a middle-aged , solidly plump volunteer , pushed the chair down the corridor to the elevator . " You 're lucky to have Dr. Highley , " she informed Katie . " His patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buzzer for someone and you 'll have a nurse at your beck and call in thirty seconds . Dr. Highley is strict . The whole staff trembles when he 's around , but he 's good . " They were at the elevator . The attendant pushed the button . " This place is so different from most hospitals . Most places do n't want to see you until you 're ready to deliver , and then they shove you out when the baby is a couple of days old . Not Dr. Highley . I 've seen him put pregnant women to bed here for two months just as a precaution . That 's why he has suites , so people can have a homelike atmosphere . Mrs. Aldrich is in the one on the second floor . She delivered by cesarean yesterday and has n't stopped crying . She 's that happy . Her husband 's just as bad . He slept on the sofa in the living room of her suite last night . Dr. Highley encourages that . Well , here 's the elevator . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They glanced at Katie curiously . Observing the magazines and flowers they were carrying , she decided they were obviously visitors . She felt oddly re- . moved from them . The minute you become a patient you lose your identity , she thought . You become a case . They got off at the third floor . The corridor was carpeted in a soft green shade . Excellent reproductions of Monet and Matisse paintings enhanced by recessed framing were scattered along the walls . In spite of herself , Katie was reassured . The volunteer wheeled her down the corridor and turned right . " You 're in the end suite , " she exclaimed . " It 's kind of far off . I do n't think there 's even any other patients on this floor today . " " That 's all right with me , " Katie murmured . She thought of John 's room . The two of them wanting to absorb each other , to stockpile against the separation . Ambulatory patients coming to the door , looking in . " How 's it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Mrs. DeMaio ? " And she , lying , " Indeed he does . " Go away , go away . We have so little time . " I do n't mind being alone on the floor , " she repeated .  | She was wheeled into a bedroom . The walls were ivory ; the carpet , the same soft green as the corridor . The furniture was antique white . Printed draperies in shades of ivory and green matched the bedspread . " Oh , this is nice , " Katie exclaimed . The attendant looked pleased . " I thought you 'd like it . The nurse will be in in a few minutes . Why do n't you just put your things away and make yourself comfortable ? " She was gone . Somewhat uncertainly , Katie undressed , put on a nightgown and warm robe . She put her toilet articles on the vanity in the bathroom and hung her clothes in the closet . What in God 's name would she do for the long , dreary evening that stretched before her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Molly 's dinner party . And when she 'd arrived , Richard had been waiting for her . She realized she was swaying . Instinctively she reached for the dresser and held on to it . The light-headed feeling passed . It was probably just the rushing , and the aftermath of the trial and  --  Let 's face it , she thought : apprehension . She was in a hospital . No matter how she tried to push away the thought , she was in a hospital . Incredible , childish , that she could not overcome her fear . Daddy . John . The two people she 'd loved best in the world had gone into the hospital and died . No matter how she tried to intellectualize , rationalize , she could not lose that terrible feeling of panic . Well , maybe this stay would get her over it . Monday night had n't been that bad . There were four doors in the room . The closet door , the bathroom door , the one leading to the corridor . The other one must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced in . As the admitting clerk had told her , it was pulled apart . The furniture was in the middle of the room and covered with painter 's drop cloths . She flicked on the light . Dr. Highley surely was a perfectionist . There was nothing the matter with the walls that she could see . No wonder hospital costs were so outrageous . Shrugging , she turned off the light , closed the door and walked over to the window . The hospital was U-shaped , the two wings parallel to each other at right angles behind the main section . She 'd been on the other side Monday night , exactly opposite where she was now . Visitors ' cars were beginning to fill the lot . Where was the parking stall she 'd dreamed about ? Oh , of course ? that one , over to the side , directly under the last light post . There was a car parked there now , a black car . In her dream it had been a black car . Those wired spokes ; the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , Mrs. DeMaio ? " She spun around . Dr. Highley was standing in the room . A young nurse was hovering at his elbow . " Oh , you startled me . I 'm fine , Doctor . " " I knocked , but you did n't hear me . " His voice was gently reproving . He came over to the window and drew the drapery . " No matter what we do , these windows are drafty , " he commented . ' We do n't want you catching cold . Suppose you sit on the bed and let me check your pressure . We 'll want to take some blood samples too . " The nurse followed him . Katie noticed that the girl 's hands were trembling . She was obviously in awe of Dr. Highley . The doctor wrapped the pressure cuff around her arm . A wave of dizziness made Katie feel as though the walls of the room were receding . She clutched at the mattress . " Is there anything wrong , Mrs. DeMaio ? " The doctor 's voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a touch faint . " He began to pump the bulb . " Nurse Renge , kindly get a cold cloth for Mrs. DeMaio 's forehead , " he instructed . The nurse obediently rushed into the bathroom . The doctor was studying the pressure gauge . " You 're a bit low . Any problems ? " " Yes . " Her voice sounded as though it belonged to someone else , or maybe as though she were in an echo chamber . " My period started again . It 's been dreadfully heavy since Wednesday . " " I 'm not surprised . Frankly , if you had n't scheduled this operation , I 'm quite sure you 'd have been forced to have it on an emergency basis . " The nurse came out of the bathroom with a neatly folded cloth . She was biting her lower lip to keep it from quivering . Katie felt a rush of sympathy for her . She neither wanted nor needed a cold compress on her forehead , but leaned back against the pillow . The nurse put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt freezing water run down her hairline . She resisted the impulse to brush it away . The doctor would notice , and she did n't want the nurse to be reprimanded . A flash of humor raised her spirits . She could just see telling Richard , " And this poor , scared kid practically drowned me . I 'll probably have bursitis of the eyebrows from now on . " Richard . She should have told him she was coming here . She wanted him with her now . Dr. Highley was holding a needle . She closed her eyes as he drew  | blood from a vein in her right arm . She watched him put the bloodfilled vacu-tubes on the tray the nurse held out to him . " I want these run through immediately , " he said brusquely . " Yes , Doctor . " The nurse scurried out , obviously delighted to get away . Dr. Highley sighed . " I 'm afraid that timid young woman is on desk duty tonight . But you wo n't require anything special , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Katie realized that she had not taken the thee-o'clock pill and it was now after six . " I 'm afraid I skipped at three o'clock , " she apologized . " I was in court and everything but the trial went out of my mind , and I guess I 'm overdue for the last one . " " Do you have the pills with you ? " " Yes , in my handbag . " She glanced at the dresser . " Do n't get up . I 'll hand it to you . " When she took the bag from him , she unzipped it , fished inside and brought out the small bottle . There were just two pills in it . The night table held a tray with a carafe of ice water and a glass . Dr. Highley poured water into the glass and gave it to her . " Finish these , " he said . " Both of them ? " " Yes . Yes . They 're very mild , and I did want you to have them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty jar into his pocket . Obediently , she swallowed the pills , feeling his eyes on her . His steel-rimmed glasses glinted under the overhead light . The glint . The spokes of the car glinting . There was a blur of red on the glass as she laid it down . He noticed it , reached for her hand and examined her finger . The tissue had become damp again . " What 's this ? " he asked . " Oh , nothng . Just a paper cut , but it must be deep . It keeps bleeding . " " I see . " He stood up . " I 've ordered a sleeping pill for you . Please take it as soon as the nurse brings it . " " I really prefer not to take sleeping pills , Doctor . They seem to cause an overreaction in me . " She wanted to sound vehement . Instead , her voice had a lazy , weak quality . " I 'm afraid I insist on the pill , Mrs. DeMaio , particularly for someone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | anxiety without it . I want you well rested in the morning . Oh , here 's your dinner now . " Katie watched as a thin , sixtyish woman carrying a tray came into the room and glanced nervously at the doctor . They 're all petrified of him , she thought . Unlike the usual plastic or metal hospital tray , this one was made of white wicker and had a side basket that held the evening newspaper . The china was delicate , the silverware gracefully carved . A single red rose stood in a slender vase . Double loin lamb chops were kept hot by a silver dome over the dinner plate . An arugula salad , julienne string beans , small hot biscuits , tea and sherbet completed the meal . The attendant turned to go . " Wait , " Dr. Highley commanded . He said to Katie , " As you will see , all my patients are served fare that compares favorably with the food in a first-class restaurant . I think one of the abiding wastes in hospitals is the tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' families bring in CARE packages from home . " He frowned . " However , I think I would prefer if you did not eat dinner tonight . I 've come to believe that the longer a patient fasts before surgery , the less likelihood she will experience discomfort after it . " " I 'm not at all hungry , " Katie said . " Fine . " He nodded to the attendant . She picked up the tray and hurried out . " I 'll leave you now , " Dr. Highley told Katie . " You will take the sleeping pill . " Her nod was noncommittal . At the door he paused . " Oh , I regret , your phone apparently is n't working . The repairman will take care of it in the morning . Is there anyone you expect to call you here tonight ? Or perhaps you 'll be having a visitor ? " " No . No calls or visitors . My sister is the only one who knows I 'm here , and she 's at the opera tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night , Mrs. DeMaio , and please relax . You can trust me to take care of you . " " I 'm sure I can . " He was gone . She leaned back on the pillow , closing her eyes . She was floating somewhere ; her body was drifting , drifting like . . . " Mrs. DeMaio . " A young voice was apologetic . Katie opened her eyes . " What . . . oh , I must have dozed . " It was Nurse Renge . She was carrying a tray with a pill in a small paper cup . " You 're to take this-now . It 's the sleeping pill Dr. Highley ordered . He said I was to stay and be sure you took it . " Even with Dr. Highley gone , the girl  | seemed nervous . " It always makes patients mad when we have to wake them up to give them a sleeping pill , but that 's the way it works in the hospital . " " Oh . " Katie reached for the pill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her carafe . " Would you like to get settled in bed now ? I 'll turn down your covers for you . " Katie realized she 'd been sleeping on top of the spread . She nodded , pulled herself up and went into the bathroom . There she removed the sleeping pill from under her tongue . Some of it had already dissolved , but she managed to spit out most of it . No way , she thought . I 'd rather be awake than have nightmares . She splashed water on her face , brushed her teeth and returned to the bedroom . She felt so weak , so vague . The nurse helped her into bed . " You really are tired , are n't you ? Well , I 'll tuck you in , and I 'm sure you 'll have a good night 's sleep . Just push the buzzer if you need me for anything . " " Thank you . " Her head was so heavy . Her eyes felt glued together . Nurse Renge went over and pulled down the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to change to rain . It 's a wicked night , a good night to be in bed . " " Open the drapes and raise the window just about an inch , wo n't you ? " Katie murmured . " I always like fresh air in my bedroom . " " Certainly . Shall I turn off the light now , Mrs. DeMaio ? " " Please . " She did n't want to do anything except sleep . " Good night , Mrs. DeMaio . " " Good night . Oh , what time is it , please ? " " Just eight o'clock . " " Thank you . " The nurse left . Katie closed her eyes . Minutes passed . Her breathing became even . At eight thirty , she was not aware of the faint sound that was caused when the handle on the door from the living room of the suite began to turn .  | GERTRUDE AND lti KRUPSRARS lingered over Gana 's pot-roast dinner . Gratefully , Gertrude acceded to Gana 's urgings to have seconds , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't usually eat this much , " she apologized , " but I have n't swallowed a morsel since we found poor Edna . " Gana nodded soberly . Her husband picked up his coffee cup and dessert plate . " The Knicks are playing , " he announced . " I 'm gon na watch . " His blunt tone was not ungracious . He settled himself in the living room and switched on the dial . Gana sighed . " The Knicks . . . the Mets . . . the Giants . . . One season after the other . But on the other hand , he 's here . I can look across the room and there he is . Or if I come home from bingo , I know I 'm not going into an empty place , like poor Edna always had to . " " I know . " Gertrude thought of her own solitary home , then reflected on her oldest granddaughter . " Gran , why not come to dinner ? " or " Gran , are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say hello . " She could have it a lot worse . " Maybe we should go in and take a look at Edna 's place , " Gana said . " I do n't want to rush you . . . I mean , have more coffee , or another piece of cake ... " " No . Oh , no . We should go in . You kind of hate to do it , but it 's something you ca n't avoid . " " I 'll get the key . "  | They hurried across the courtyard . While they were at the table , the wet , cold combination of snow and rain had once again begun to fall . Gana dug her chin into her coat collar . She thought of Edna 's lovely imitation-leopard coat . Maybe she could take it home tonight . It was hers . Inside the apartment , they became quiet . The fingerprinting powder the detectives had used was still visible on the tabletops and door handles . Inadvertently , they both stared at the spot where Edna 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radiator , " Gana muttered . " Gus 'll probably repaint it . " " Yes . " Gertrude shook herself . Get this over with . She knew her granddaughter 's taste . Besides the velour couch , Nan would love those matching chairs , the tall-backed ones with mahogany arms and legs . One was a rocker , the other a straight chair . She remembered Edna 's telling her that when she was a child , they 'd been covered in blue velvet with a delicate leaf pattern . She 'd had them redone inexpensively and always sighed , " They never looked the same . " If Nan had them re-covered in velvet again , they 'd be beautiful . And that piecrust table . Altman 's had copies of that in the reproduction gallery . Cost a fortune , too . Of course , this one was pretty nicked , but Nan 's husband could refinish anything . Oh , Edna , Gertrude thought . You were smarter than most of us . You knew the value of things . Gana was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last year , " she said . " I was going to a social with Gus . I love it . " It did not take them long to finish sharing the contents of the apartment . Gana had little interest in the furniture ; what Gertrude did not want she was giving to the Salvation Army ; but she was delighted when Gertrude suggested she take the silver plate and good china . They agreed that Edna 's wardrobe would also go to the Salvation Army . She had been shorter and heavier than either of them . " I guess that 's it , " Gana sighed . " Except for the jewelry , and the police will give that back to us pretty soon . You get the ring , and she left the pin to me . " The jewelry . Edna had kept it in the night-table drawer . Gertrude thought of Tuesday night . That was the drawer Dr. Highley had started to open . " That reminds me , " she said : " we never did look there . Let 's make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it open . She knew  | that the police had removed the jewelry box . But the deep drawer was not empty . A scuffed moccasin lay at the bottom of it . " Well , as I live and breathe , " Gana sighed . " Now , can you tell me why Edna would save that thing ? " She picked it up and held it to the light . It was out of shape ; the heel was run down ; white stains on the sides suggested it had been exposed to salted snow . " That 's it ! " Gertrude cried . " That 's what had me mixed up . " At Gana 's mystified expression , she tried to explain . " Mrs. DeMaio asked me if Edna called one of the doctors Prince Charming . And that 's what confused me . Of course she did n't . But Edna did tell me how Mrs. Lewis wore terrible old moccasins for her appointments . Why , she pointed them out to me only a couple of weeks ago when Mrs. Lewis was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The left shoe was too loose , and Mrs. Lewis was always walking out of it . Edna used to tease Mrs. Lewis that she must be expecting Prince Charming to pick up her glass slipper . " " But Prince Charming was n't Cinderella 's boyfriend , " Gana protested . " He was in the Sleeping Beauty ' fairy tale . " " That 's what I mean . I told Edna that she had it mixed up . She just laughed and said that Mrs. Lewis told her the same thing , but that her mother told her the story that way and it was good enough for her . " Gertrude reflected . " Mrs. DeMaio was so anxious when she asked about that Prince Charming talk . And Wednesday night  --  I wonder : could Mrs. Lewis ' shoe be what Dr. Highley wanted from this drawer ? Is that possible ? You know , I 've half a mind to go to Mrs. DeMaio 's office and talk to her , or at least leave a message for her . Somehow I just feel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus , who would n't have his eyes off the set until nearly midnight . Her acquisitive desire for excitement surged . She 'd never been in the Prosecutor 's office . " Mrs. DeMaio asked me whether Edna kept her mother 's old shoe for sentimental reasons , " she said . " I 'll bet she was talking about this moccasin . Tell you what : I 'll drive over there with you . Gus 'll never know I 'm gone . "  | JIM BERKELEY parked his car in the courthouse lot and went into the main lobby . The directory showed that the Medical Examiner 's office was on the second floor in the old wing of the building . He had seen the expression on Richard Carroll 's face last night when he 'd looked at the baby . Anger and resentment had made him want to say , " So the baby does n't look like us . So what ? " But it would have been stupid to do that . Worse , it would have been useless . After several wrong turns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . The secretarial desk was empty , but Richard 's door was open , and he came out immediately when he heard the reception-area door snap shut . " Jim , it 's good of you to come . " Obviously , he was trying to be friendly , Jim thought . He was trying to make this seem a casual meeting . His own greeting was reserved and cautious . They went inside . Richard eyed him . Jim stared back impassively . There was none of the easy humor of last night 's dinner . Obviously , Richard got the message . His manner became businesslike . Jim stiffened . " Jim , we 're investigating Vangie Lewis ' death . She was a patient at Westlake Maternity Clinic . That 's where your wife had the baby . " Jim nodded . Richard was obviously picking his words carefully . " We are disturbed at some problems that we see coming out of our investigation . Now , I want to ask you some questions  --  and I swear to you  | that your answers will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to us , if ? " " If I tell you that Maryanne is adopted . Is that it ? " " Yes ! ' The anger drained from Jim . He thought of Maryanne . Whatever the cost , she was worth having . " No , she is not adopted . I was at her birth . I filmed it . She has a small birthmark on her left thumb . It shows in those pictures . " " It is quite unlikely for two brown-eyed parents to have a greeneyed child , " Richard said flatly . Then he stopped . " Are you the baby 's father ? " he asked quietly . Jim stared down at his hands . " If you mean would Liz have had an affair with another man ? No . I 'd stake my life and my soul on that . " " How about artificial insemination ? " Richard asked . " Dr. Highley is a fertility expert . " " Liz and I discussed that possibility , " Jim said . " We both rejected it years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not told you ? It 's not that unusual anymore . There are some fifteen thousand babies born every year in the United States by that means . " Jim reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet . Flipping it open , he showed Richard two pictures of Liz , himself and the baby . In the first one , Maryanne was an infant ; her eyes were almost shut . The second was a recent Kodachrome . The contrast between the skin tone and eye color of the parents and the baby was unmistakable . Jim said , " The year before Liz became pregnant , we learned that it was almost impossible for us to adopt . Liz and I discussed artificial insemination . We both decided against it , but I was more emphatic than she . Maryanne had light brown hair when she was born , and blue eyes . A lot of babies start out having blue eyes and then they turn the parents ' color . So it 's just the last few months that it 's become obvious that something is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . " He looked at Richard . " My wife wo n't even tell a social lie . She 's the most honest person I 've ever known in my life . Last month I decided to make it easy for her . I said that I 'd been wrong about artificial insemination , that I could see why people went ahead with it . " " What did she say ? " Richard asked . " She knew what I meant , of course . She said that if I thought she  | could make a decision like that and not tell me , I did n't understand our relationship . " I apologized to her , swore I did n't mean that ; went through hell trying to reassure her . Finally , she believed me . " He stared at the picture . " But of course , I know she was lying , " he blurted out . " Or else she was n't aware of what Highley did to her , " Richard said flatly .  | DANNYBOY Duxr zigzagged across Third Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parked . The woman had missed her wallet just as he got on the escalator . He 'd heard her scream , " That man , the dark-haired one  --  he just robbed me . " He 'd managed to slide through the wall of women on Alexander 's main floor , but that bitch came rushing down the escalator after him , shouting and pointing as he went out the door . The security guard would probably chase him . If he could just get to the car . He could n't ditch the wallet . It was stuffed with hundred-dollar bills . He 'd seen them , and he needed a fix . It had been a good idea to go into Alexander 's fur department . Women brought cash to Alexander 's . It took too long to get a check or credit card cleared . He 'd found that out when he worked as a stock boy there while he was still in high school . Tonight he 'd worn a coat that made him look like a stock boy . Nobody had paid any attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open pocketbooks ; she 'd held it by one strap as she rummaged through the coat rack . It had been easy to grab her wallet . Was he being followed ? He did n't dare look back . He 'd call too much attention to himself . Better to stay against the sides of the buildings . Everyone was hurrying . It was so lousy cold . He could afford a fix ; plenty of fixes now . And in a minute he 'd be in the car . He would n't be a man run-  | ning in the street . He 'd drive away , over the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge , and be home in Jackson Heights . He 'd get his fix . He looked back . No one running . No cops . Last night had been so lousy . The doorman had almost grabbed him when he broke into that doctor 's car . And what did he get for his risk ? No drugs in the bag . A medical file , a messy paperweight and an old shoe , for Christ sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Ten lousy bucks . He 'd barely been able to get enough stuff to tide him over today . The pocketbook and bag were in the back seat of the car . He 'd have to get rid of them . He was at the car . He opened it , slipped in . Never , never , no matter how bad off he was , would he get rid of the car . Cops do n't expect you to drive away . If you 're spotted , they check the subway stations . He put the key into the ignition , turned on the engine . Even before he saw the flashing dome light , he heard the siren of the police car as it raced the wrong way up the block . He tried to pull out , but the squad car cut him off . A cop , his hand on the butt of his pistol , jumped out . The headlights were blinding Danny . The cop yanked open his door , looked in and removed the ignition key . " Well , Dannyboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? Do n't you never learn any new tricks ?

She was holding his hand tightly , but he knew it had nothing to do with flying . Joan was absolutely fearless in a plane . He 'd heard her argue the point with people who hated to fly . " Statistically , you 're much safer in a plane than in a car , a train , a motorcycle or your bathtub , " she 'd say . Her face was composed . She 'd insisted they have a drink when cocktails were served . Neither one of them had wanted dinner , but they 'd both had coffee . Her expression was serious but composed . " Chris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except thinking that because of me Vangie committed suicide . Do n't worry about dragging me into this . You tell the truth when you 're questioned and do n't hold anything back . " Joan . If they ever got through this , they 'd have a good life together . She was a woman . He still had so much to learn about her . He had n't even realized he could trust her with the simple truth . Maybe he 'd gotten so used to shielding Vangie , from trying to avoid arguments . He had so much to learn about himself , let alone Joan . The landing was rough . Several passengers exclaimed as the plane bounced down . Chris knew the pilot had done a good job . There was a hell of a downwind . If it kept up , they 'd probably close the airport . Joan grinned at him . " The stewardess must have brought us in .

And he 'll tell you everything he knows . "  | MOLLY SETTLED BACK as the orchestra began the few bars of music that signaled the beginning of Otello . Bill loved opera . She liked it . Maybe that was part of the reason she could n't relax . Bill was already totally absorbed , his expression serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed as usual . Their seats were excellent . They should be . Bill had paid seventy dollars for the pair . Overhead the chandeliers twinkled , glistened and then began to fade into silvery darkness . She should have insisted on going to see Katie in the hospital tonight . Bill did n't , could n't understand Katie 's dread of hospitals . No wonder . Katie was ashamed to talk about it . The awful part was that there was a basis for her fear . Daddy had n't gotten help in time . The old man who was in the room with him had told them that . Even Bill admitted that a lot of mistakes were made in hospitals . With a start she heard applause as Placido Domingo descended from the ship . She 'd heard nothing of the opera so far . Bill glanced over at her , and she tried to look as though she were enjoying herself . After the first act , she 'd phone Katie . That would help to reassure her . Just hearing Katie 's voice that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hospital early in the morning before the operation and make sure Katie was n't too nervous . The first act seemed interminable . She had never realized it was so long . Finally , intermission came . Impatiently refusing Bill 's sugges-  | tion of a glass of champagne from the lobby bar , she hurried to a phone . Quickly , she dialed and jammed in the necessary coins . A few minutes later , white-lipped , she rushed to Bill . Half sobbing , she grabbed his arm . " Something 's wrong , something 's wrong . . . I called the hospital . They would n't put the call through to Katie 's room . They said the doctor forbade calls . I got the desk and insisted the nurse check on Katie . She just came back . She 's a kid , she 's hysterical . Katie 's not in her room . Katie 's missing . "  | HE LEFT KATIE 'S ROOM and a smile of satisfaction flitted across his face . It was going very well . The pills were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her blood was no longer clotting . He went down to the second floor and stopped in to see Mrs. Aldrich . The baby was in a crib by her bed . Her husband was with her . He smiled aloofly at the parents , then bent over the child . " A handsome specimen indeed , " he proclaimed . " I do n't think we 'll trade him in . " He knew his attempts at humor were heavy-handed , but sometimes it was necessary . These people were important , very important . Delano Aldrich could direct thousands of dollars of research funds to Westlake . More research . He could work in the laboratory with animals , report his successes . Then , when he publicly began work with women , all the experimentation of these years would make immediate success inevitable . Fame deferred is not necessarily fame denied . Delano Aldrich was staring at his son , his face a study in awe and admiration . " Doctor , we still ca n't believe it . Everyone else said we 'd never have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was her anxiety that had been the main problem . Fukhito had spotted that . Muscular dystrophy in her father 's family . She knew she might be a carrier . That and some fibroid cysts in her womb . He 'd taken care of the cysts and  | she 'd become pregnant . Then he 'd done an early test of the amniotic fluid and had been able to reassure her on the dystrophy question . Still , she was a highly emotional , almost hyperactive personality . She 'd had two early miscarriages over ten years ago . He 'd put her to bed two months before the birth . And it had worked . " I 'll stop in in the morning . " These people would be fervent witnesses for him if there was any question that Katie DeMaio 's death was suspicious . But there should n't be any question . The dropping blood pressure was a matter of hospital record . The emergency operation would take place in the presence of the top nurses on the staff . He 'd even send for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a good man , the best . Molloy would be able to tell the family and Katie 's office that it had been impossible to stop the hemorrhaging , that Dr. Highley had headed a team working frantically . Leaving the Aldriches , he went to Nurse Renge 's desk . He had carefully manipulated the schedule so that she was on . A more experienced nurse would check on Katie every ten minutes . Renge was n't that bright . " Nurse Renge . " " Doctor . " She stood up quickly , her hands fluttering nervously . " I am quite concerned about Mrs. DeMaio . Her blood pressure is in the low normal limit , but I suspect the vaginal bleeding has been heavier than she realizes . I 'm going out for dinner , then will come back . I want the lab report on her blood count ready . I did not want to distress her  --  she has a lifelong fear of hospitals  --  but I should not be surprised if we have to operate tonight . I 'll make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I persuaded her not to eat dinner , and if she requests any solid food , do not give it to her . " " Yes , Doctor . " " Give Mrs. DeMaio the sleeping pill , and do not in any way intimate to her that emergency surgery may be necessary . Is that clear ? " " Yes , Doctor . " " Very well . " He made a point of speaking to several people in the main lobby . He 'd decided to have dinner at the restaurant adjacent to the hospital grounds . It was n't bad . One could get a quite decent steak , and he wanted to be able later to present the image of a conscientious doctor . I was concerned about Mrs. DeMaio . Instead of going home , I had  | dinner next door and went directly back to the hospital to check on her . Thank God I did . At least we tried . And another important point . Even on a dismal night like this , it would not be unusual to walk over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long he 'd been gone . Because while he was waiting for coffee to be served , he 'd take the last necessary step . He had left Katie at five past seven . At quarter of eight he was in the restaurant . Katie was going to be given the sleeping pill at eight o'clock . It was a strong one . Thanks to her weakened condition , it would knock her out immediately . By eight thirty it would be safe for him to go up to the back stairs to the third floor , go into the living room of the suite , make sure Katie was asleep and give her the shot of heparin , the powerful anticoagulant drug which combined with the pills , would send her blood pressure and blood count plummeting . He 'd come back here and finish coffee , pay his bill and then return to the hospital . He 'd take Nurse Renge up with him to check on Katie . Ten minutes later Katie would be in surgery . She had made it so easy by not having visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that possibility . He 'd have slipped the heparin into the transfusion she 'd be receiving during the operation . That would have been just as effective , but riskier . The steak was adequate . Odd how hungry he became at times like this . He would have preferred waiting until after it was over to eat , but that would be almost impossible . By the time Katie 's sister was reached it would be well after midnight , since she was at the opera . He 'd wait at the hospital for her , to console her . She 'd remember how kind he 'd been . He would n't get home until two or three . He could n't fast that long . He permitted himself one glass of wine . He 'd have preferred his usual half-bottle , but that was impossible tonight . Nevertheless , the one glass warmed him , made him more alert , helped his mind to rove over the possibilities , to anticipate the unexpected . This would be the end of the danger . His bag had not shown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eliminated . The papers reported his death as " fell or jumped . " Edna was buried this morning . Vangie Lewis had been interred yesterday . The moccasin in Edna 's drawer would mean nothing to the people who disposed of her shabby belongings . A terrible week . And so unnecessary . He should be allowed to openly pursue his work . A generation ago artificial insemination was  | considered outrageous . Now thousands of babies were born that way every year . Go back hundreds of years . The Arabs used to destroy their enemies by infiltrating their camps and impregnating their mares with cotton soaked with the semen of inferior stallions . Remarkable genius to have planned that . The doctors who had performed the first successful in vitro fertilization were geniuses . But his genius surpassed them all . And nothing would stand in the way of his reaping the rewards due him . The Nobel Prize . Some day he would receive it . For contributions to medicine not imagined possible . He had single-handedly solved the abortion problem , the sterility problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Copernicus he would be considered a criminal . " Did you enjoy your dinner , Doctor ? " The waitress was familiar . Oh , yes , he had delivered her some years ago . A boy . " Very much indeed . And how is your son ? " " Fine , sir . Simply fine . " " Wonderful . " Incredible this woman and her husband had met his fee , giving him the money saved for a down payment for a home . Well , she 'd got what she wanted . " I 'd like cappuccino , please . " " Certainly , Doctor , but that will take about ten minutes . " " While you 're getting it , I 'll make some phone calls . " He 'd be gone less than ten minutes . Now the waitress would n't miss him . Through the window he noticed that the snow had stopped . He could n't , of course , take his coat from the checkroom . Slipping out the side door near the hallway with the telephones and rest rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit at his face , but he scarcely noticed it . He was planning every step . It was easy to keep in the shadows . He had his key to the fire exit in the rear of the maternity wing . No one ever used those stairs . He let himself into the building . The stairway was brightly lighted . He turned off the switch . He could find his way through this hospital blindfolded . At the third floor he opened the door cautiously , listened . There was no sound . Noiselessly he stepped into the hall . An instant later he was inside the living room of Katie 's suite . That had been another problem he 'd considered . Suppose some-  | one accompanied her to the hospital : her sister , a friend ? Suppose that person asked to stay overnight on the sofa bed in the living room ? The Westlake Clinic openly encouraged sleeping in if the patient desired it . By ordering this living room repainted , he 'd effectively blocked that possibility . Planning . Planning . It was everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory . This afternoon he had left the needle with the heparin in a drawer of an end table under the painter 's drop cloth . The light from the parking lot filtered through the window , giving him enough visibility to find the table at once . He reached for the needle . Now for the most important moment of all . If Katie woke up and saw him , he 'd be exposed to danger . Granted , she would probably fall back asleep immediately . Certainly she 'd never question the injection . But when he returned with Nurse Renge later , if she was by some chance still conscious , if she said anything about the shot , it would be a risk . Oh , it would be easy enough to explain : she was confused ; she meant when I took the blood samples . Even so . Better if she did n't wake up now . He was in the room , bending over her . He reached for her arm . The drapery was partly open . Faint light was coming into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned from him . Her breathing was uneven . She was talking in her sleep . He could not catch the words . She must be dreaming . He slipped the needle into her arm , squeezed . She winced and sighed . Her eyes , cloudy with sleep , opened as she turned her head . In the dim light he could see the enlarged pupils . She looked up at him puzzled . " Dr. Highley , " she murmured , " why did you kill Vangie Lewis ? "  | Scorn MYERSON WAS more tired than angry . Since Vangie Lewis ' body had been found Tuesday morning , two other people had died . Two very decent people  --  a hard-working receptionist who deserved a few years ' freedom after supporting and caring for aged parents and a doctor who was making a real contribution to medicine . They had died because he had not moved fast enough . Chris Lewis was a murderer . Scott was sure of that . The web drawing around Lewis was unbreakable . If only they had realized immediately that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought Lewis in for questioning immediately . They might have cracked him . And if they had , Edna Bums and Emmet Salem would be alive now . Scott could n't wait for the chance to get to Lewis . Any man who could murder his pregnant wife was capable of any cold-blooded murder . Lewis proved that . He was the worst kind of criminal . The one who did n't look or sound the part . The one you trusted and turned your back on . Lewis and his girlfriend were landing at seven . They should be here by eight . Lewis was cool , all right . Knew better than to run . Thought he could brazen it out . Knows it 's all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence can be a lot better than eyewitness testimony when properly presented in court . Scott would try the case himself . It would be his pleasure . At seven fifty , Richard walked into Scott 's office . He did not waste  | time on preliminaries . " I think we 've uncovered a cesspool , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maternity Concept . " " If you 're saying that the shrink was probably playing around with Vangie Lewis , I agree , " Scott said . " But I thought we decided that this afternoon . Anyhow , it 's going to be easy enough to find out . Get blood samples from the fetus and we 'll bring Fukhito in . He ca n't refuse to have his blood tested . If he does , it 's an open admission of guilt , and he 'd be finished with medicine if another paternity case was proved . " " That 's not what I 'm talking about , " Richard broke in impatiently . " It 's Highley I 'm after . I think he 's experimenting with his patients . I just spoke to the husband of one of them . There 's no way he 's the baby 's father , but he was present at the birth . He 's been thinking that his wife agreed to artificial insemination without his permission . I think it goes beyond that . I think Highley is performing artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're able to produce miracle babies under his care . " Scott snorted . " You mean to say you think Highley would inject Vangie Lewis with the semen of an Oriental father and expect to get away with it ? Come on , Richard . " " Maybe he did n't know the donor was Oriental . Maybe he made a mistake . " " Doctors do n't make mistakes like that . Even allowing your theory to be true . . . and frankly , I do n't buy it . . . that does n't make him Vangie 's murderer . " " There 's something wrong with Highley , " Richard insisted . " I 've felt it from the first minute I laid eyes on him . " " Look , we 'll investigate Westlake Maternity . That 's no problem . If there 's any kind of violation there , we 'll find it and prosecute it . If you 're right and he 's inseminating women without their consent , we 'll get him . That 's a direct violation of the Offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that later . Right now Chris Lewis is my first order of business . " " Do this , " Richard persisted . " Go back further with the check on Highley . I 'm already looking into the malpractice suits against him . Some woman , a Mrs. Horan , will be here shortly to tell why she pressed a suit . But the Newsmaker article says he was in Liverpool , in England , before he came here . Let 's phone there and see if we can find any trace of impropriety . They 'll give you that information . " Scott shrugged . " Sure , go ahead . " The buzzer on his desk sounded . He switched on the intercom .  | " Bring him in , " he said . Leaning back on his chair , he looked at Richard . " The bereaved widower , Captain Lewis , is here with his paramour , " he said .  | DANNYBOY DUKE SAT IN the precinct house hunched miserably forward in a chair . He was perspiring ; his nerves were on edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another thirty seconds he 'd have been away .

He can identify you . But who 'd you hit with that paperweight , Danny ? Tell us about it . And what about that shoe , Danny ? Since when do you save beat-up shoes ? Tell us about that . " " It was in the bag , " Danny whispered . The two detectives looked at each other . One of them shrugged  | and turned to the newspaper on the desk behind him . The other dropped the file he had been examining back into the bag . " All right , Danny . We 're calling Dr. Salem to find out just what he had in this bag . That 'll settle it . It could go easier if you 'd cooperate . You 've been around long enough to figure that out ? The other detective looked up from the paper . " Dr. Salem ? " His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the file . Oh , I see . The nameplate says Dr. Edgar Highley . Guess he had a patient 's file from some other doctor . " The younger detective came over to the table carrying the morning Daily News . He opened the file and examined the sheaf of papers with the name EMMET SALEM , M.D. printed across the top . He pointed to page three of the News . " Salem 's the doctor who was found on the roof of the Essex House extension last night . The Valley County Prosecutor is working with our people on that case . " The police officers looked at Dannyboy with renewed interest and nar owed , suspicious eyes .  | HE WATCHED AS Katie 's eyes closed and her breathing became even . She 'd fallen asleep again . The question about Vangie had come from somewhere in her subconscious , triggered perhaps by a duplication of her mental state of Monday night . She might not even remember asking the question , but he could n't take the chance . Suppose she talked about it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operating room before they anesthetized her ? His mind groped for a solution . Her presence at the window last Monday night could still destroy him . He had to kill her before Nurse Renge made her check , in less than an hour . The heparin shot would act to anticoagulate her blood immediately , but it would take several hours to complete the procedure . That was what he had planned . Now he could n't wait . He had to give her a second shot , immediately . He had heparin in his office . He did n't dare go near the hospital dispensary . He 'd have to go down the fire stairs to the parking lot , use the private door to his office , refill the hypodermic needle and come back up here . It would take at least five minutes . The waitress would start to question his absence from the table , but there was no help for that . Satisfied that Katie was asleep , he hurried from the room .  | THE TECHNICIAN IN the Valley County Forensic Lab worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to compare all microscopic samples from the home of the presumed suicide Vangie Lewis with all microscopic samples from the home of the presumed accident victim Edna Bums . Carefully he had sifted the vacuum-bag contents of the Lewis home and the Burns apartment and painstakingly searched for substances that might be out of the ordinary . The technician knew he had a superb instinct for microscopic evidence , a hunch factor that rarely failed him . He was always particularly interested in loose hair , and he was fond of saying , " We are like fur-bearing animals . It 's astonishing how much hair we are constantly shedding , including people who are virtually bald . " In the exhibits from the Lewis home he found an abundance of strands of the ash-blond hair of the victim . He 'd also found medium brown hair , a fair quantity of it , in the bedroom . Undoubtedly the husband 's , since those same hairs were in the den and living room . But there were also a number of silverish-sandy hairs in the victim 's bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strands of hair could easily come from a visitor or deliveryman , but the bedroom ? Even in this day , there were few non-family members who were invited to enter the bedroom . Shafts found there assumed special significance . The hair had come from a man 's head . The length suggested that automatically . Some of the same strands were on the coat the victim had been wearing .  | And then the technician found the connection Richard Carroll had been seeking . Several sandy hairs with silver roots were clinging to the faded blue bathrobe of Edna Bums . He placed the samples of hair under powerful microscopes and painstakingly went through the sixteen points of comparison check . There was absolutely no doubt . One person had been close to both dead women ; close enough to have held a head near to Edna Bums 's chest and to have brushed a head on Vangie Lewis ' shoulder . The technician reached for the phone to call Dr. Carroll .  | SHE TRIED TO wake up . There was a click : a door had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm hurt . Dr. Highley . She dropped off . . . . What had she said to Dr. Highley ? Katie woke up a few minutes later and remembered . Remembered the black car and the shiny spokes and the light on his glasses . She 'd seen that Monday night . Dr. Highley had carried Vangie Lewis to his car Monday night . Dr. Highley had killed Vangie . Richard had suspected something . Richard had tried to tell her . But she would n't listen . Dr. Highley knew she knew about him . Why had she asked him that question ? She had to get out of here . He was going to kill her too . She 'd always had nightmares about hospitals . Because somehow she 'd known that she would die in a hospital . Where had Dr. Highley gone ? He 'd be back . She knew that . Back to kill her . Help . She needed help . Why was she so weak ? Her finger was bleeding . The pills he had given her . Since she 'd been taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were making her bleed . Oh God , help me , please . The phone . The phone ! Katie fumbled for it . Her hand , weak and unsteady , knocked it over . Shaking her head , forcing her eyes to stay open , she pulled it up by the cord . Finally she had the receiver at her ear . The line was dead . Frantically she jiggled the cradle , tried dialing the operator . Dr. Highley had said the phone was being repaired . She pushed  | the bell for the nurse . The nurse would help her . But the click that should have turned on the light outside her door did not happen . She was sure the signal was n't lighting the nurse 's panel either . She had to get out of here before Dr. Highley came back . Waves of dizziness nauseated her as she stood up . She had to . Vangie Lewis . The long blond hair , the petulant , little-girl eagerness for a child . Dr. Highley had killed Vangie , killed her baby . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , holding on to the footrail . The elevator . She 'd go down in the elevator to the second floor . There were people there  --  other patients , nurses . From nearby a door closed . He was coming back . He was coming back . Frantically Katie looked at the open door to the corridor . He 'd see her if she went out there . The bathroom door had no lock . The closet . He 'd find her there . Through sheer willpower she managed to stumble to the door leading to the living room , open it , go inside , close it before he came into the bedroom . ' Where could she go ? He 'd look for her immediately . She could n't stay here . If she tried to go out into the foyer , she 'd pass the open door of the bedroom . He 'd see her . She had to go down the foyer and turn left , then down the long hall to the elevator . She was no match for him . Where could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the bedroom looking for her . Should she try to hide under the drop cloth ? No . No . She 'd be trapped there . He 'd find her , drag her out . She bit her lips as dizziness clawed at the space behind her eyes . Her legs were rubbery , her mouth and skin spongy . She stumbled to the door of the living room , the one that led to the hall . There was another door there , the fire exit . She 'd seen it when she was wheeled in . She 'd go down that to the second floor . She 'd get help . She was in the hall . In a minute he 'd be behind her . The door to the fire stairs was heavy . She tugged at it . . . tugged again . Reluctantly it gave way . She opened it , stepped inside . It closed so slowly . Would he see it closing ? The stairs . It was so dark here , terribly dark . But she could n't turn on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running down the corridor toward the elevator . If he did that , she 'd have an extra minute . She needed that minute . Help me . Help me . She grabbed onto the banister . The stairs were steep . Her bare feet were silent . How many stairs in a flight ? Thirteen . No , that was a house . There was a landing here after eight steps . Then another flight . Eight more steps , then she 'd be safe . Seven . . . five  | ... one . She was at the door , tried to turn the handle . It was locked . It opened only from the other side . From upstairs she heard the third-floor door open and heavy footsteps coming down the stairs .  | CHRIS REFUSED TO call a lawyer . He sat opposite the Prosecutor . He had been so worried about this encounter , so afraid they would n't believe him . But Joan believed him ; Joan had said , " It just makes sense that they 'll be suspicious of you , Chris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Bible , The truth shall make you free . ' " Chris looked from the Prosecutor to the two detectives who had met him at the airport . " I have nothing to hide , " he said . Scott was unimpressed . A bookish-looking young man carrying a stenographer 's pad came into the room , sat down , opened the pad and took out a pen . Scott looked directly at Chris . " Captain Lewis , it is my duty to inform you that you are a suspect in the deaths of Vangie Lewis , Edna Burns and Dr. Emmet Salem . You may remain silent . You are not required to answer any questions . At any point you may refuse to continue answering questions . You are entitled to the services of a lawyer . Any statement that you make can be used against you . Is that perfectly clear ? " " Yes . ' " Can you read ? " Chris stared at Scott . Was he being sarcastic ? No , the man was deadly serious . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a copy of the  | Miranda warning you have just heard . Please read it carefully . Be sure you understand it and then , if you are so disposed , sign it . " Chris read the statement swiftly , signed it and handed it back . " Very well . " Scott pushed the paper to one side . His manner changed , became somehow more intense . Chris realized the formal questioning was about to begin . Funny , he thought , every night of your life , if you wanted to , you could watch some form of cops-and-robbers or courtroom drama show and you never expect to get involved in one yourself . The Prosecutor obviously believed that he had killed Vangie . Was he crazy not to have legal counsel ? No . The Prosecutor was talking . " Captain Lewis , have you been in any way ill-treated or abused ? " " I have not . " " Would you care for coffee or food ? " Chris rubbed his hand over his forehead . " I would like coffee , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even so , he was not prepared for Scott 's question . " Did you murder your wife , Vangie Lewis ? " Chris looked directly at him . " I did not murder my wife . I do not know if she was murdered . But I do know this . If she died before midnight Monday night , she did not kill herself in our home . " Scott , Charley , Phil and the stenographer were startled into unprofessional astonishment as Chris calmly said , " I was there just before midnight Monday . Vangie was not home . I returned to New York . At eleven the next morning I found her in bed . It was n't until the funeral director came to the house for clothes to dress my wife for burial and told me the time of death that I realized that her dead body must have been returned to our house . But even before that I knew something was wrong . My wife would never have worn or even tried to put on the shoes she was wearing when she4as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes she could wear were a pair of battered moccasins a cleaning woman had left . Her right leg and foot were badly swollen . She even used those moccasins as bedroom slippers .... " It was easier than he had expected . He heard the questions coming at him : " You left the hotel at eight P.M. Monday night and returned at ten . ' Where did you go ? " " To a movie in Greenwich Village . After I got back to the motel , I could n't sleep . I decided to drive home and talk to Vangie . That was shortly after midnight . "  | " Why did n't you stay and wait for your wife ? " And then the one that was a hammerblow to his stomach : " Did you know your wife was carrying a Japanese fetus ? " " Oh , my God ! " Horror somehow mingled with a sense of release flooded Chris 's being . It hadn't. been his baby . A Japanese fetus . That psychiatrist . Was he louse enough to do that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , the poor kid . No wonder she was getting so frightened to give birth . That must have been why she called Dr. Salem . She wanted to hide . Oh , God , she was such a child . The questions came : " You were not aware your wife was involved with another man ? " " No . No . " " Why did you go to Edna Bums 's apartment Tuesday night ? " The coffee came . He tried to answer . " Wait , please  --  can we take this just the way it happened ? " He began to sip the coffee . It helped . " It was Tuesday night , just after I realized that Vangie had died before she was brought home , that that woman , Edna Burns , called . She was almost incoherent . She rambled on about Cinderella and Prince Charming , said she had something for me , something I 'd want to have , and she had a story for the police . I thought she might know who Vangie had been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to admit that I 'd been home Monday night . I wanted to keep Joan out of this . " He set down the coffee cup , remembering Tuesday night . It seemed so long ago . Everything was so out of proportion . " I drove to Miss Burns 's housing development . Some kid was walking his dog and pointed out her apartment to me . I rang the bell and knocked on the door . The television was on , the light was on , but she did n't answer . I figured she 'd passed out and there was no use trying to talk to her , that maybe she was just a crank . I went home . " " You never went in ? " " No . " " What time was that ? " " About nine thirty . " " All right . What did you do then ? " The questions , one after another ; he drank more coffee . Truth . The simple truth . It was so much easier than evasion . Keep the future in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a life together . He thought of the way she 'd looked at him , thrown her arms around him last night in her apartment . For the first time in his entire life , he 'd known there was someone he could go to in trouble ;  | someone who would want to share it with him . Everyone else  --  Vangie , even his parents  --  had always leaned on him . For better , for worse . It would be better for them . Joan , my darling , he thought . He took a deep breath . They were asking about Dr. Salem .  | RICHARD SAT AT Katie 's desk as he waited for the staff director of Christ Hospital , Devon , to answer his phone . Only by emphasizing the urgency of his need to talk to someone in authority who had been at the hospital more than ten years had he been given the man 's private number . While he waited , he looked around . The table behind Katie 's desk was filled with files she was working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time off after her accident . But no matter how busy , she should have stayed home . This afternoon she 'd looked lousy . And losing that case today must have upset her terribly . He wished he 'd seen her before she left . The phone continued to jab . The guy must be out or asleep . Maybe it could wait till morning . No . He wanted to find out now . There were snapshots in a frame on Katie 's desk . Katie with an older woman , probably her mother . He knew the mother lived in Florida somewhere . Katie with Jennifer , Molly 's oldest . Katie looked like Jen 's big sister . Katie with a group of people in ski outfits . These must be the friends she stayed with in Vermont . No picture of John DeMaio . But Katie was n't the kind to subtly remind people at work that she was the widow of a prominent judge . And there certainly were plenty of pictures of him around that house . The phone continued to ring . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to note that there were no pia  | tures of any other guy either . He 'd been analyzing his reaction to Katie 's announcement that she 'd be away for the weekend . He 'd tried to make it look as though he were surprised that she would n't be available with a big case breaking . Hell . That had nothing to do with it . He was worried that she was with some other guy . " Yes . " An angry , sleepy voice had answered the phone . Richard straightened up , tightened his grip on the receiver . " Mr. Reeves ? Mr. Alexander Reeves ? " " Yes . " Richard went directly to the point . " Sir , I apologize profusely for calling you at this hour , but the matter is vital . This is a transatlantic call . I 'm Dr. Richard Carroll , the Medical Examiner of Valley County , New Jersey . I must have information about Dr. Edgar Highley . " The sleepiness vanished from the other man 's voice . It became intense and wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have just spoken with Queen Mary Clinic in Liverpool and was surprised to learn that Dr. Highley had been on staff there a relatively short time . We had been led to believe otherwise . However , I was told that Dr. Highley was a member of the Christ Hospital staff for at least nine years . Is that accurate ? " " Edgar Highley interned with us after his graduation from Cambridge . He is a brilliant doctor and was invited to become staff , specializing in obstetrics and gynecology . " " ' Why did he leave ? " " After his wife 's death he relocated in Liverpool . Then we heard he had emigrated to the United States . That 's not uncommon , of course . Many of our physicians and surgeons will not tolerate the relatively low pay structure of our socialized medicine system . " " There was no other reason for Dr. Highley 's resignation ? " " I do n't understand your question . " Richard took a chance . " I think you do , Mr. Reeves . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't waste time being discreet . I believe that Dr. Highley may be experimenting with his pregnant patients , perhaps even with their lives . Is there any justification that you can offer to support that possibility ? " There was a long pause . The words that came next were slow and deliberately enunciated . " While he was with us , Dr. Highley was not only a practicing physician , but was deeply involved in prenatal research . He did quite brilliant experiments on embryos of frogs and  | mammals . Then a fellow doctor began to suspect that he was experimenting with aborted human fetuses  --  which is , of course , illegal . " " What was done about it ? " " It was kept very quiet , of course , but he was being watched very carefully . Then a tragedy occurred . Dr. Highley 's wife died suddenly . There was no way we could prove anything , but the suspicion existed that he had implanted her with an aborted fetus . Dr. Highley was asked to resign . This is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shred of proof , and I must expect that you treat this conversation as inviolable . " Richard absorbed what he had heard . His hunch had been right . How many women had Highley killed experimenting on them ? A question came into his mind  --  a wild , long-shot possibility . " Mr. Reeves , " he asked , " do you by any chance know a Dr. Emmet Salem ? " The voice warmed immediately . " Of course I do . A good friend . Why , Dr. Salem was visiting staff here at the time of the Highley scandal . "  | SILENTLY KATIE RAN down the stairs to the main floor . Desperately she grasped the knob , tried to open the door . But it would not give . It was locked . Upstairs , the footsteps had paused . He was trying the second-floor knob , making sure that she had not escaped him . The footsteps started again . He was coming down . No one would hear her if she screamed . These heavy doors were fireproof . No hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door , there were people : visitors , patients , nurses . Less than six inches away . But they could not hear her . He was coming . He would reach her , kill her . She felt heavy , dull pain in her pelvic area . She was flowing heavily . Whatever he had given her had started the hemorrhaging . She was dizzy . But she had to get away . He had made Vangie 's death look like suicide . He still might get away with that . Wildly she began rushing down the staircase . There was one more flight . It probably led to the basement of the hospital . He 'd have to explain how and why she 'd gotten there . The farther she got , the more questions would be asked . She stumbled on the last stair . Do n't fall . Do n't make it look like an accident . Edna had fallen . Or had she ? Had he killed Edna too ? But she 'd be trapped here . Another door . This one would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the mid landing . Dark as it was , she could see movement , a presence rushing down at her .  | The door opened . The corridor was dimly lit . She was in the basement . She saw rooms ahead . Quiet . It was so quiet . The door snapped closed behind her . Could she hide somewhere ? Help me . Help me . There was a switch on the wall . She pressed her hand on it . Her finger smeared it with blood . The corridor disappeared into blackness as a few feet behind her the door from the stairwell burst open .  | HIGHLEY WAS SUSPECTED of causing his first wife 's death . Winifred Westlake 's cousin believed he had caused Winifred 's death . Highley was a brilliant researcher . Highley may have been experimenting on some of the women who were his patients . Highley may have injected Vangie Lewis with the semen of an Oriental male . But why ? Did he hope to get away with it ? Undoubtedly he knew Fukhito 's background . Would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident ? Had he used the wrong semen ? Or had Vangie been involved with Fukhito ? Was Dr. Highley 's possible experimentation only incidental to Vangie 's pregnancy ? Richard could not find the answer . He sat at Katie 's desk twirling her Mark Cross pen . She always carried this . She must have rushed out of here this evening and forgotten to pick it up . But of course , she 'd been upset . Losing that case must have rattled her badly . Katie would take that hard . Katie took a lot of things hard . He wished he knew where she was . He wanted to talk to her . The way her finger bled . He 'd have to ask Molly if she knew whether or not Katie had a low platelet count . That could be a real problem . A chill made Richard 's fingers stiffen . That could be a sign of leukemia . Oh , God . Monday , he 'd drag Katie to a doctor if he had to tie her up to do it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Her eyes were emerald green , large and oval . Beautiful eyes . Beautiful kid .  | " Dr. Carroll . " " Maureen , I 'm sorry I asked you to stay . I thought Mrs. Horan would be here long ago . " " It 's all right . She did phone . She 's on her way . Something came up at work and they needed her . But there are two women here . They 're friends of the Miss Burns who died . They wanted to see Katie . I told them she was gone , and one of them mentioned your name . She met you the other night when you were at the Burns apartment ; a Mrs. Fitzgerald . " " Fitzgerald ? . . . Sure . Mrs. Fitzgerald is a parttime receptionist at Westlake Hospital . " As Richard said " Westlake , " he stood up . " Tell them to come on in . Maybe you 'd better call Scott . " " Mr. Myerson is absolutely not to be disturbed . He and Charley and Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll talk to them . Then if it 's anything much , we 'll make them wait . " They came in together , Gana 's eyes snapping with excitement . She had regretfully decided not to wear Edna 's leopard coat . It just seemed too soon . But she had her story ready to tell . Gertrude was carrying the moccasin in a paper bag . Her neat gray hair was every inch in place . Her scarf was knotted at her throat . The good dinner had faded into memory , and now more than anything she wanted to get home and to bed . But she was glad to talk to Dr. Carroll . She was going to tell him that the other night in poor Edna 's apartment , Dr. Highley had been pulling open the night-table drawer . There was nothing in that drawer except the shoe . Did Dr. Carroll think that Dr. Highley wanted to get that shoe for any reason ? Mrs. DeMaio had been so interested in that Prince Charming business . Dr. Carroll might want to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in Monday . Dr. Carroll was looking at them expectantly . Gertrude leaned forward , shook the bag , and the shabby moccasin fell onto Katie 's desk . Primly she began to explain , " That shoe is the reason we are here . "  | SHE ZIGZAGGED DOWN the corridor . Would he know where the light switch was ? Would he dare to turn it on ? Suppose there was someone down here ? Should she try to scream ? He knew this hospital . Where would she go ? There had been a door at the end of the hall . The farthest door . Maybe he 'd try the others first . Maybe she could lock herself in somewhere . She might miss the doors on the side . But if she ran straight , she 'd have to touch that far wall . The door was in the middle . Her finger was bleeding . She 'd try to smear blood on the door . When the nurse made her rounds , they 'd start to search for her . Maybe they 'd notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening for her . Would he see a shadow when the door opened ? Her outstretched hand touched a cold wall . Oh , God , let me find the door . Her hand ran down the wall . She touched a doorframe . Behind her she heard a faint squeaking sound . He had opened that first door . But now he would n't bother to look in that room . He 'd realize he had n't heard that squeak , that she had n't tried that door . Her hand found a knob . She turned it deliberately , grinding her cut finger against it . A heavy formaldehyde smell filled her nostrils . From behind her she heard rushing feet . Too late . Too late . She tried to push the door closed , but it was shoved open . She stumbled and fell . She was so dizzy , so dizzy . She reached out . Her hand touched a pants leg . " It 's all over , Katie , " Dr. Highley said .  | " ARE You SURE this is your wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am absolutely certain . This is the one that was so loose on her . . . the left one . " " When Edna Burns phoned you , did she tell you she had this shoe ? " " No . She said she had something to tell the police and that she wanted to talk to me . " " Did you get an impression of blackmail . . . of threat ? " " No , drunken garrulousness . I knew she was from Westlake Hospital . I did n't realize then that she was the receptionist Vangie used to talk about . She said Edna was always kidding her about her glass slippers . " " All right . Your statement will be typed immediately . Read it carefully , sign it if you find it accurate and then you can go home . We 'll want to talk with you again tomorrow morning . " For the first time Chris felt as though the Prosecutor had begun to believe him . He got up to go . " Where is Joan ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Oh , one thing : what impression do you have of Dr. Highley ? " " I never met him . " " Did you read this article about him ? " Scott held up Newsmaker magazine . Chris looked at the article , at the picture of Dr. Highley . " I saw this yesterday on the plane into New York . "  | Memory jogged . " That 's it , " he said . " That 's what I could n't place . " " What are you talking about ? " Scott asked . " That was the man who came down in the elevator at the Essex House last night when I was trying to reach Dr. Salem . "  | HE SWITCHED ON A light . Through the haze she could see his fullcheeked face , his eyes protruding as he stared down at her , his skin glistening with perspiration , his sandy hair falling untidily on his forehead . She managed to stumble to her feet . She was in a small area like a waiting room . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrank back against the door . " You 've made it so easy for me , Mrs. DeMaio . " Now he was smiling at her . " Everyone close to you knows about your fear of hospitals . When Nurse Renge and I make rounds in a few minutes , we 'll assume you left the hospital . ' We 'll call your sister , but she wo n't be home for several hours , will she ? We wo n't start looking for you in the hospital until much later . Certainly no one will dream of looking for you here . " An old man died in the emergency room tonight . He 's in one of those vaults . Tomorrow morning when the undertaker comes for his body , you 'll be found . It will be obvious what happened to you . You were hemorrhaging ; you became disoriented , almost comatose . Tragically , you wandered down here and bled to death . " " No . " His face was blurring . She was so dizzy . She was swaying . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her through it , held her as she slid down . She had fainted . Kneeling beside her , he injected the last shot of heparin . She probably would n't recover consciousness again . Even if she did , she could n't get out .
