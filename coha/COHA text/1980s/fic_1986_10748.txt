Gallia from what would have been a ruinous barbarian attack . We have taken the lead in rebuilding defenses throughout the peninsula . Commerce begins to revive as the risks diminish . Folk should soon start reconstructing what 's been destroyed . Maximus must be a madman to wish this changed ; and he is not . That 's the more so when he still has to reckon with the untamed Germani and Alani and , it may be , his fellow Emperors in the South and East . Far from helpless , Ys is in an excellent bargaining position . " I 'd liefer not brag , but this and more we have done under my guidance . And I have been not only your King , but also the prefect of Rome . " Then be glad if we can renew our ties to Rome the Mother ! " There was some discreet applause , some reservation , several faces that stayed troubled . Hannon Baltisi scowled , cleared his throat , and rasped : " Well and good , 0 King , save for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need I recall to you how they mock the Gods there , violate temples , smash images , hound worshippers ? Will Christdwell in peace with the Gods of Ys , those Gods who alone hold Ocean atbay ? " Mumbles and whispers passed among the forty-two . The legionaries who formed Gratillonius 's honor guard kept still , but he could virtually feel resentment radiate from most of them at such a denunciation of their faith . He weighed his reply carefully . The old man 's travels , in his days as a sea captain , had if anything reinforced his fanatical hatred of the Church ; but persons more moderate were uneasy , and for cause . " This is a question among many that I hope to take up with the Augustus , " Gratillonius said . " It touches me too , not only in my royal office but in my heart . " He congratulated himself on the subtlety of this reminder that he was a Mithraist . Before ground could be broken for the temple of his dreams , foundations must be laid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact is that the Empire continues full of people who are not Christians , a number of them in high positions . Maximus knew my beliefs when he appointed me your prefect . " Clergy are few and far between in these parts . The Augustus should be satisfied with a new minister here for the Christians among us , just as we had before . That was a harmless man . Fate willing , I 'll have a voice in choosing his successor . Rest assured , ' twill be no Ambrosius ! " Bodilis and three or four others recognized the name of the forceful bishop of Italian Mediolanum , and smiled . Relief spread visibly through the rest . Gratillonius pursued his advantage . " To that end , I may have to search a while , " he warned . " Also , ' t would be well that I make myself familiarp361with conditions throughout Lugdunensis , aye , and in Aquitania  --  " he saw Bodilis kindle , and tipped her a wink  --  " so that we 'll be ready to cope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be absent at the equinox and mayhap at the winter solstice , as well as other occasions . Yet I 'll leave the city in order , fully able to steer itself that long . Surely the Gods will take no offense , when this is for the well-being of Their people . " He knew himself for a hypocrite . But his ultimate purpose was honest , and as a soldier he had never objected to ruses . He sat down on the throne , resigned to a theological dispute . Bodilis and Lanarvilis were primed to conduct it for him . Afterward would come practical topics . What should he say and seek in Treverorum ? He sincerely wanted suggestions . If need be , let discussion go on for a few days . Only a few , however . He must not keep the Emperor waiting . It chanced that this was his night to spend with Innilis . Knowing how he felt , and remembering the mother , his wives tried to shift custody of Dahut so that he could see her when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not , since strict rotation was impossible . He might be preoccupied , perhaps out of the city altogether , in the hinterland or on the water or standing his monthly Watch at the Wood . He might have been working hard or late , and in sheer weariness bedded down alone at the royal palace . For her part , a Queen might likewise be overbusied , or having her courses , or sick . Pregnancies and childbirths had been interveningtoo , and bade fair to increase . Forsquilis was now fruitful , Guilvilis was again , and Maldunilis had finally decided to trouble herself about it . Moreover , the two Gallicenae with whom he did not sleep , aged Quinipilis and aging Fennalis , claimed a share in the upbringing of Dahilis 's daughter , which for the sake of harmony could not be denied them . Fortune did have Dahut at Innilis 's house when King and Queen arrivedon that evening . " Oh , my lord , my lady , how good you 're back ! " exclaimed the maidservant Evar as they entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw such a tantrum I feared she 'd hurt herself , I did , and restrained her . " Dread struck . " Is she ill ? " Gratillonius demanded . " Nay , lord , I think not . Like a crazed ferret she 's been , for dashing about and throwing things  --  oh , my , ferrets do n't throw things , but myp362lord knows what I mean  --  ' T is but that kids are troublous in their third year . Well , she 's not quite in that yet , is she ? But ever so far ahead of her age , already speaking , and so much alive . With my lady gone all day  --  Does my lord want to see her ? " " I do . " He brushed past the woman and strode to the room that had been designated a nursery . When he opened the door , he saw the debris of small destructions strewn about , a broken toy chariot , stuffing ripped out of a rag doll , general chaos . The chamber pot stayed upright ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The child was curled on the bed , brooding over her wrongs . She had stripped off her clothes . Sunset light , striking through a windowpane , turned her skin to ivory , hair to gold , eyes to lapis lazuli. 0 Mithras , how she recalled Dahilis ! She gathered her limbs beneath her , again like a cat . " Father , " she hissed . " Ah , " he blustered , " we 've been having a mutiny , have we ? What for ? Why have you been such a bad girl ? " She struggled for words . " I wos . . . wos . . . me . " Did she mean " all alone " ? How could he tell ? He hunkered down and spread his arms . " Well , well , little rebel , let 's make it right again , hey ? " She uncoiled and sped to him . He hugged her withy-slimness . How sweet she smelled ! " You must n't do this , you know , " he said into the warmth between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your Mamas , or their poor servants who have to look after you . " " You di'n ' come , " she gasped ; but she shed no tears , she hardly ever did . " Oh , you were awaiting me ? I 'm sorry . Your Papa had work to do . Let 's get you nicely dressed , and then before Evar brings you dinner we 'll play horse and I 'll sing you a song  --  because you 're the single human being who does not flinch when I sing , and too soon will that end . "  --  Innilis ate lightly and simply . Gratillonius liked the fare her kitchen offered , after the frequently elaborate meals he got in Ys . She had learned to give him portions of adequate size . Ordinarily they made small talk over the table and retired early , for although she often showed him affection , they had few interests in common . This evening she spoke earnestly . The glow of beeswax candles lay over the delicate features and in the big eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could barely hear . " There is something about her . " He harked back to a night on Sena , and a day when a seal had saved the child from drowning , and incidents more fugitive . It took courage top363reply , " Mayhap we see the beginnings of a destiny . Or mayhap not . Who can say ? I 've scant faith in astrologers or fortune tellers . Let 's take each day as it comes . We must anyhow . " " Oh , I thought not of the occult . I meant only  --  well , I 've fretted about this , and talked with Vindilis  --  Vindilis and others  --  Do we do right , shunting her from household to household , with never a den where she can snuggle down ? Is this why she 's wild ? " He frowned . " I know not . How could I ? She 's my first-born . " Unless he was the casual begetter of a brat or two in Britannia , of which transgressionhe hoped Mithras had absolved him . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has not the Sisterhood always shared in the raisingof a princess whose mother died ? " " Aye , but I think never like this . You are different . And Dahut is . I can not put it in words , I 'm too weak and stupid to understand it , but Vindilis says  --  You are the bringer of a new Age , and you did father Dahut . " Different , he thought , indeed different . The daughter of Dahilis is so spirited , so intelligent and beautiful.  --  After Innilis miscarried , he had agreed with Vindilis that henceforwardshe should use the Herb . The next stillbirth could kill her , or the next live birth give another pitiful Audris . Six fertile Queens were ample . She had not asked him to refrain from making love to her . He had found his way to what was best : much kissing and caressing , then much gentleness , for a single time . About half such joinings seemed to give her pleasure , and the rest no distress . At least , she cuddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was unusual . He could feel how she tensed and faintly shivered against him . " What vexes you ? " he asked . When she grew evasive , he pressed the query . In the end she confessed : " Oh , you , Grallon , fear about you . " She seldom gave him his proper name any more but , like an increasing number of Ysans and Osismii , softened it . " You 're bound away . " " I 'll return , " he said . She drew a ragged breath . " Aye , since you 've promised it . But how long will you stay ? You surely yearn back to your homeland . " He lay for a spell , unspeaking . The question haunted him too , but nobody else had raised it . He was astounded that this meek person should . And what in Ahriman 's name was the answer ? Of course there was a great deal yet to do in Ys , and he hated leaving a task unfinished . The challenge here called him beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddled and never really complete ,  |p364unlike  the making of a thing in woodcraft . Just the same , the satisfactions bore no comparison to each other . He had shaped history and law , he had raised bulwarks for the lives of people . . . . What would come of it all ? A barbarian wave had broken itself against Ys , but the tide of barbarism was still at the flow , over land as well as sea . Could he abandon the defenses he had been building ? And yet , never to have a son , if it was true what chronicles and belief said . To abide among aliens until the last death-fight in the Wood made an end of himAnd meanwhile , would those duties truly have been so important ? Once the rule of Maximus was firm , his peace would soon reach this far . Likewise , in due course , would his law . What then would be left for the King of Ys ? Ceremonies ; routines ; judgments that made a difference to the parties concerned but were yawnfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else . Even now , calm was descending . Though northern Britannia seemed again troubled , the rest of that diocese lay secure . Communications had redeveloped to the point where Gratillonius had had three letters from his father , and sent back replies . To visit the villa once more ! Not that he 'd accept the wretched curial existence of his free will ; but he should n't have to . Given the tiniest hint , Maximus Augustus ought to confer senatorial rank on a man who had served him well . And mighty work remained to do in the outer world , reform of the state , subjugation of the barbarians , binding of wounds upon Mother Rome , winning of fame immortal . Was that his wish ? If not , why not ? Ys would never consentingly let its King depart for good . In the past he had wondered about cutting his way free , he and his legionaries or a rescue expedition from outside . But that thought was obsolete  --  which gladdened him , because he recoiled from any idea of killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a pretext for another journey , and fail to return . II would n't hurt the city 's institutions too badly . Precedents existed ; not every king had died in the Wood . The Suffetes would get somebody  --  until , no doubt , the Christians came to power here also , and made an end of those bloody successions . Three years hence , let us say , what reason would Gratillonius have to dwell in Ys ? Well , status , friends , his wives , or certain among them , and Dahut , whom he could smuggle out but would that be the best thing for her ? Innilis nestled against him , weeping most quietly . " Nay , I will abide , " he said , and wondered how much of a liar he was , " as long as the Gods allow . "  | " Again the tuba , the tuba calling : Come , legionary , get off your dui ' The hobnails rising , the hobnails falling , We 're bound for glory , or some such stuff . Farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulp a beaker before we go . The Lord on high knows how we will miss you , So give us memories that will glow . " It was one of the old , interminable , nonsensical songs that men had sung as they marched from Pontus to Hispania , from Egypt to Caledonia , and beyond , in the service of Rome . Footfalls crashed rhythmically beneath its beat . Words rang into the woodlands bordering the highway , until they lost themselves among trees and shadows . This was mostly secondgrowthforest , beech , elm , hornbeam , though here and there gloomed a huge oak , hallowed perhaps since before the first Caesar , until cultivation died away a hundred or more years ago . Leaves were still thick , full of greenish-gold light , but some had begun to turn color . The air below was windless , cool , scented by damp earth . Overhead were fewer wings than last month ; many birds had , by now , departed south . Riding at the front of his two dozen infantrymen and their pack animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a dim distance , it went from sight in one of those curves that had been the engineers ' reluctant concession to terrain . Behind him lay turbulent CondateRedonum , where soldiers of his had nearly gotten into a fight with members of the Frankish garrison . Ahead , he had been informed , was the Liger valley , rich and well populated as of yore . At Juliomagus he would swing east and follow the great river for a while . His route was not thep366shortest possible , but almost entirely , it followed roads like this . Spared slogging through mud in the wet season , and most often spared the toil of preparing a walled and ditched camp  --  because well-secured official hostelsstood along the way , near which they could simply pitch their tents  --  the men should make their best time to Augusta Treverorum . They were eager too . While they had all become fond of Ys , and several had formed strong ties , the hankering to be back among things Roman was only natural . That had been a large part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nobody else . As for the rest of his reason , he was n't quite sure , but he had a notion that Magnus Maximus would not take kindly to a spokesman native to witchy Ys . Otherwise his feelings were happy . He also was bound home to his people . " I 'm getting old and my joints are creaky , The lentils grumble within my gut , My tentmates snore and the tent is leaky , And come a combat , I might get cut . But never mind , we have got our orders . So cheer up , fellows , for I do thinkWhen we have crossed over foreign bordersThere will be wenches , and lots to drink ! " " ' O-old ! " Adminius cried . The deputy could bring a surprising volumeout of his narrow chest . " Battle ranks ! " Gratillonius heard clatter and scramble . He drew rein . Gravel scrunched to silence on the shoulder where he rode . Glancing back , he saw the vexillation quickly bring the animals together and themselves in position either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training . Adminius trotted over to him . " Being cautious , sir , " he said . " Wot does the centurion want we should do ? " Gratillonius peered ahead . No danger was obvious in the mounted man who had come around the curve and was galloping their way . As he spied them , he waved and shouted frantically , and kicked his horse to go faster . The beast was sweaty but not yet lathered ; it had n't carried him far . The man was portly , with black hair cut short and a close-cropped fringe of beard in the Roman style , but tunic and trousers showed him to be a Gaul . Soon Gratillonius made out a dull-red splotch on his left thigh , from which edges of cloth flapped back . A flesh wound . That went with the condition of the horse . " No pursuit , " Adminius deemed . " ' E 's escaped . Did n't seem worth chasing , I s'pose . " He squirted a gob of spit from a gap between teeth . Hisp367thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't know anybodylike us was anywhere near , eh , sir ? " Beneath Gratillonius 's calm went an ugly thrill . " We 'll wait and hear what he 's got to say . " The Gaul halted in front of them . For a moment the only sounds were the whickering breath of the horse and the man 's gasps . His eyes rolled . At length he got out , " Romans ! Legionaries ! God be praised ! Quick , and you may yet save us ! " The Latin was fairly good , with an accent that Gratillonius recognized as that of the Namnetes . He had come as far south as their seaport two years ago , when he was trying to link the cities of the littoral in cooperationagainst barbarians and neutrality in the civil war . " The sooner you make sense and tell me what the matter is , the sooner we may be able to do something about it , " he snapped . " Bacaudae  --  " The man groaned . " That 's no news . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mastered himself in some degree . " My wagon train . . . goods out of Armorica and Britannia . . . left Redonum . . . . Bishop Arator and his attendants joined us there , bound for a conference in Portus Namnetum . We 'd been told the route was safe . I b-b-brought guards anyway , of course . But now , in th-th-this forsaken stretch . . . suddenly , there they were , scores of the vilest robbers springing out of the woods and  --  " He plucked at Gratillonius 's wrist . " God aided me to flee , because I found you . Do n't delay ! It 's only two or three leagues . The guards will fight . You can get there in time . God calls you ! " The centurion spent a flash considering . His mission took primacy . However , his squadron should be a match for any plausible number of outlaws ; banditry required suppression ; and if word got about that he had been less than zealous in the cause of a prelate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the consequences to Ys . " On the move ! " he barked . Adminius shouted commands . Metal gleamed as the formation reshaped itself and started off . The Gaul kept his horse alongside Gratillonius 's . " Ca n't you go faster ? " he pleaded . The centurion shook his head . " Three or four miles at a dead run in full armor would n't leave the boys fit for much . We 'll do what we can . I promise nothing . We may find everybody in your convoy lying throat-cut , and your merchandise gone with your animals . In that case , I ca n't pursue . We 're on urgent business of the state . I can only ask the garrison commander in Juliomagus to try for vengeance . "  |p368He  felt no great excitement . If he could save yonder folk and kill marauders , that was fine . It depended on how long the guards could hold out . The steady , relentless tramp at his back had carried Rome 's eagles across the world . " Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what strength did you have ? " The merchant swung his hands and sometimes keened over the loss he might suffer , but piece by piece , the tale came forth . He was one Florus , a dealer in fabrics . With money what it was these days , he most commonly traded rather than bought and sold , which meant he handled a variety , not just cloths but leathers , furs , raw materials . " This trip my best acquisitionwas a consignment of those wonderful weavings they do in Ys , that have scarcely been seen for many years , oh , priceless . . . . " The train consisted of four mule-drawn wagons ; their drivers ; the reverend bishop with two priests and four deacons ; Florus himself ; and six guards , toughs who hired out for this kind of duty despite the law frowning on it . Two were Gauls , three were Frankish laeti , and one was a brown-skinned person who said nothing about himself but might well be a deserter from the army . " We take what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The guards had sword or ax , plus a few spears . Their armor amounted to boiled leather jackets , cheap kettle helmets , shields of barbarian type . Then , to be sure , the muledrivers possessed knives , cudgels , whips . And three of the deacons were young and sturdy , equipped with stout walking staffs . " They should be able to fend off the evildoers a while , do n't you think ? But hurry , hurry ! " " How did you get away ? " Gratillonius inquired . " Oh , I was mounted , by the mercy of God , and when they swarmed out it was clear what they intended , and by God 's grace they did n't close a line across the road to the north before I 'd gone past . They almost did . You can see where a spear hurt me . Do you have a surgeon with you ? Or at least poultices ? This kind of injury inflames so readily . It hurts me abominably . " " We 're not stopping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One more man defending might make all the difference . " " But I had to get help . God saw to it that I could get help . " Florus 's voice sank to a mutter . " That means the goods will be safe , does n't it , 0 Lord ? You 'd not let Your faithful servant be ruined , almighty God Who delivers us from evil . " Gratillonius snorted and sent his horse a little ahead . Slowly the tumult became visible from afar . Noise drifted thin . Gratilloniussignalled for double time . He was tempted to speed in advance for a better look . It was getting hard to see any distance as the sun declinedp369and dusk began to seep out of the earth . He resisted the impulse . He had no right to take unnecessary risks . Solitary heroics were for barbarians and fools . Yonder they grew aware of his approaching force . He saw the struggle die down , like a wave that smashed itself on a reef outside Ys , recoiled in foam , and dwindled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and jumped to the ground . The men saw his intention and needed but a minute to tether the horses . " You , keep out of the way ! " he told Florus . He unslung his shield from the harness , slipped the retaining strap over his neck , gripped the handle , drew blade , and took his place as leader . The squadron advanced . Nearing , he saw that the battle was almost done . The travelers had given a good account of themselves . Somehow they 'd gotten three wagons on the sides of a square , cutting loose the mules , which might well panic . There had n't been time to bring the fourth around , it stood off where the robbers must have led it , but a crude little fort existed . While three guards held fast at the open side , their comrades and certain of the other men repelled foes who sought to climb over the vehicles or crawl underneath . Yet they could not long keep off assailants whom Gratillonius estimatedto number thirty . As he guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  only because the bandits lacked proper training and discipline . After being cast back with losses , the outlaws milled around , none wanting to be the first to meet that steel again . They tried to bargain . Gratillonius learned afterward that the bishop had strengthened the will to resist , calling on divine help , while he cleverly strung the talk out . At length the brigands lost patience and made a fresh charge . It failed likewise , though at heavy cost to the defenders . After that , the attackers resorted to slings . Kept up , the bombardment would have done its job . The travelers took wounds and a couple more deaths . However , they had enough protection to be difficult targets , and eventually the supply of missiles was exhausted . Yet the defense was now so weakened that the bandit leader could egg his men on to a third assault . It broke through and was in among the wagons when the legionariesarrived . Gratillonius took his troop toward chaos . The outlaws were Gauls , in ragged , filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever else came to hand . Hair and beards were matted , greasy manes , out of which glared faces gaunt , scarred , weatherbeaten . Shoes were agape , rudely mended , or mere bags of skin stuffed with grass . The barbarians who raided Britannia were better off . Weapons were spears , knives , pruning hooks , firewood axes , a few swords acquired somehow . The wieldersp370screamed hatred and defiance at the Romans . At the same time , those on the fringe were pulling back , making for the trees , in disorderly fashion . They knew that if they stood their ground they 'd be butcher 's meat . Which was exactly what they ought to be . " Right and left ! " Gratilloniuscalled . " Circle them ! " He leading a detachment , Adminius its mate , his men hastened to bag as many as they could . Those inside the laager could not readily disengage from opponents who , heartened , fought furiously . It had never been a proper battle at all , but more like a riot . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them tripping over each other . Somebody fallen but alive might grab at an ankle or cling to a spearshaft . Wrestlers on the ground further impeded everyone . First from the soldiers went the terrible flight of javelins . Meant for use against shields , here they struck unprotected flesh . Men fell , writhed , shrieked . Those who tried to help them to safety were themselves delayed . And then the legionaries were upon them . A fair-haired youth with downy whiskers attempted to dodge past Gratillonius . The centurion gave him the sword between rib cage and pelvis , forcing the blade right and left to make sure of the liver . Flesh resisted softly , heavily , helplessly . The lad went down . Before Gratillonius could pull his weapon free , a full-grown man was at him , weeping , howling , belly wide open as he swung his arms back for an ax blow . Gratillonius rammed the boss of his shield into the solar plexus . Breath whooped from the Gaul . He dropped his ax and fell to his knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's temple . The Gaul crumpled . Gratillonius had delivered a knockout blow he hoped was n't fatal . He wanted prisoners to bring to Juliomagus for beheading , or whatever the judgment would be  --  examples . He withdrew his sword . Blood pumped forth . A stump end of gut protruded past the tattered shirt . " Mother , " the youth wailed , over and over . Gratillonius went on . The whole episode had taken just a minute or two , scarcely interrupting the rhythm of onslaught . He saw a cluster of men pass under the trees , disappearing amidst boles and brush . They bore along a figure robed and struggling . He had no chance to think about it . He only had a fleeting perception of one who seemed in charge , slender , swift of motion , uniquely well-clad . After that , Gratillonius was busy finishing the engagement.  --  The legionaries had suffered no harm worth mentioning . Of the travelers , besides Florus , there survived , slashed and battered but reasonably hale , two Frankish men-at-arms , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay stretched out on the roadside , blood wiped off as best might be , dead or dying . The clergyman had already prayed over them . And Bishop Arator was missing . As for the robbers , a full twelve had fallen in battle or , hopelessly wounded , received the mercy stroke . Their bodies were stacked on the opposite side of the road . Nobody had cleansed them , closed staring eyes or tied up fallen jaws , but the kindly shadows were well on the way to covering them . Six captives sat bound to the wagons . Nobody said much . Most of the survivors were still too stunned . Now and then pain made somebody moan . Otherwise they huddled , shivered , looked emptily before them , clutched the bread and wine that had been passed out . The soldiers were in full self-possession but occupied with making a safe camp , since they would spend the night here . An occasional sentence , grunt , oath sounded beneath the thud of axes , the sucking noise as spades turned wet humus . Gratillonius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from the dead , wounded , captured , the thickening blood puddles . As yet , the sky and the crowns of trees were bright overhead . A few rays slanted golden through the westside gloom . Only a hint of chill was in the air . Crows cawed . " But the bishop is gone , " Florus wailed . " A holy man , a lord of the Church , borne off by a gang of sacrilegious murderers ! I 'll never live down the scandal , never . And my mules , my well-trained carters , lost ! Why could you not make better speed ? " " I told you , " Gratillonius said wearily . " If you mean to complain at the garrison , spare your breath . Any competent officer will understand . Be glad we saved what we did and can help you finish your journey . " His command would have to do that . The chances of some other group coming along , whom he could dump the chore onto , were slight , as feeble as traffic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a dozen outlaws were still at large . The delay in his own progress would be excused him . Though the Christians would be aghast at what had happened to a veritable bishop " Hs-s-s , " whispered from the brush . " Roman , listen . " Gratillonius spun about . He saw nothing but tangled green , murk behind it . Helmetless in the aftermath of battle , the breeze cool upon his brow , did he hear a rustling ? " Hs-s-s , " went the voice again . " Hark'ee . " " What 's this ? " yelped Florus . " Are the murderers back ? Help ! To arms ! " Gratillonius caught him by the nape and squeezed till he whimpered.  | " Be still , " the centurion said , never looking away from the forest . " Go back to your wagons and say nothing . I'lll handle this . " " But  --  you ca n't  --  " " Begone and shut up , or I 'll have you flogged . " He let go . Florus stumbled off , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The Bacauda chief . Make no move , if you want your bishop back alive . " Something eased in Gratillonius . He heard himself chuckle . " Very well , " he said . " Now how shall we go about bargaining ? " The centurion 's tent was large enough for two men to sit in , on its floor which kept out the dampness of the soil . Its walls likewise withstood autumnal cold . Outside , a wind had arisen after nightfall , to rush through branches , whirl dead leaves away , rattle the leather of the tent and make its poles tremble . Within , a lantern threw dull highlights onto faces , against monstrous shadows . " Your price is high , " Gratillonius said . Rufinus shrugged and grinned . " One bishop for six Bacaudae . Take it or leave it . Myself , I think I 'm being swindled . " Gratillonius peered at him . His invited visitor was young , about nineteenor twenty he guessed , though the spirit behind the green eyes seemed as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of it in his legs , and wirily built . Features otherwise sharp and regular were marred by the scar of a cut , poorly treated , puckering his right cheek and giving his mouth the hint of a perpetual sneer . Though his beard was still scanty , he kept it trimmed in an unconventional fork . His black hair was also short , and reasonably clean , as were the rest of his person and his clothes . Faded , many times patched or darned , shirt and breeches were of stout material . A deerskin jerkin gave additional protection , and he had doffed a cowled cloak . His footgear was clearly from no shoemaker 's shop , but just as clearly made to his measure with a degree of skill . At his belt were a pouch , a knife , and a Roman sword . " You put me in a cleft stick , " Gratillonius said . " Unless I let dangerous bandits go free , what will become of the bishop ? " " He 'll be butchered like a hog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the boys will use him . "  | " What ? " " Well , we seldom see a woman , you know . Though in this case , it 'd be revenge more than lust . I would n't want that withered prune . " Fury thickened in Gratillonius 's throat . He could barely stay where he was , and not assail the other . " You rotten snake ! " Rufinus lifted a palm . " Hold on , " he said . " I 'm only warning , not threatening . I 'd forbid such a thing if I could . But I 'm no army officer . We 're free men , we Bacaudae . We choose our leaders ourselves , and followtheir orders if and when we want to . My gang is enraged . If they do n't get their friends back  --  if , instead , those fellows go off to death , maybe first to torture  --  I ca n't stand in the way of their justice . They 'd kick me aside . " He leaned forward . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and idioms strange to Gratillonius . " As is , " he said , " I 'll hear curses aplenty when they learn they wo n't get a ransom besides the exchange . I wonder how you dare hold back stuff that could make you sure of your holy man . " Gratillonius returned a grim smile . " He 's not my holy man . I 'll have to answer for whatever happens . Leave me this much to show . If you wo n't , well , I need just report that no meeting took place . " He did n't know if he could bring himself to that . Certainly he could not if put under oath . However , he need n't reveal his vulnerability . " Besides , think . You 'll have to go far and fast , before the garrison comes after you . This wood is n't too big for them to beat . Four of our prisoners are too hurt to walk much . They 'll encumber you enough , without adding boxes of goods . " Rufinus laughed . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . I did hope for some solidi , but you win . " He grew serious , with an underlying liveliness that never seemed to leave him . " How 's this sound ? We meet at sunrise . You keep your men in camp . We 're woodsrunners ; we 'll know whether you 're honest about that . We 'll show up half a mile south with the bishop . One of us 'll stand by him  --  me  --  ready to kill if anything goes sour . You release our four disabled buddies and give time for us to carry them well away . Then two of you bring our two hale down the road . You can have their hands tied and leashes on them , and you can have swords , but no javelins . We stop a few yards apart and let our hostages go , both sides . The bishop 's slow on his feet , so I 'll release him first , but you 've got to release ours while he 's still near enough for me to dash up and stab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind if I play you false . We scamper off into the woods and you return to camp . Satisfied ? " Gratillonius pondered . This was a quick intelligence he dealt with.  | " The leashes will be long , so your fellows ca n't bolt off after we let go , " he decided . " When they reach you , you can cut the cords . " Again Rufinus laughed . " Done ! You 're a workman , Gratillonius . Be damned if I do n't like you . " In his relief , the centurion could n't help smiling back . " Are n't you damned already ? " Mercurially , the Gaul turned somber . " No doubt , if it 's true what the Christians say . But then I expect the fire for me wo n't be so hot as what they keep for the great landowners and senators . Do you really know the masters you serve ? " Memories crowded on Gratillonius . He scowled . " Better them than outright banditry . I 've seen enough places looted and burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and oldsters killed for fun , that I 've no lost no sleep after striking down what reavers I could  --  be they barbarians or Romans . " Rufinus gave him a long look before murmuring , " You are n't from hereabouts , are you ? " " N-no , I 'm a Briton . But these past two years and more I 've been in Armorica . Osismiic country , that is . " " I do n't believe there 're any Bacaudae that far west . " " There are n't . Most of it 's been picked too clean . Ys alone has stayed well off , because it 's got ways to keep the wolves out . " Rufinus sat straight . His eyes caught the lantern light as they widened . " Ys , " he breathed . " You 've been there ? " " I 've operated in the area . " Gratillonius 's instinct was to reveal no more to an enemy than was unavoidable . " Now I 'm on a different mission . I planned no fight with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've suffered , blame yourselves . " " Ys , the city of fable  --  " Rufinus broke off , shook himself , spoke sharply . " I 've never been yon way , of course , but I can guess what kind of wolves ' you 're thinking of . Saxons and Scoti for the most part , hey ? And some Gauls who took the chance to go looting around after everything was wreckage  --  though I 'll bet a lot of those were driven to it by hunger . Where was the Roman state that taxed them and ordered them about , where was it when they needed it ? But anyhow , they were not Bacaudae . " " Do you mean you 're something else than marauders ? " " I do . " With bitterness : " You would n't care to listen . I 'll go now . See you in the morning . " " No , wait ! " Gratillonius thought for a moment . " If you 'll stay a while , I 'll hear you out . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had gotten up . His movements were apt to be quick , nervous , but deft . " Well , you see , " Gratillonius explained , " I am a Briton , and my time in Gallia has all been at the far western end , except for a march there from Gesoriacum . But I may be , well , in future I may be having business elsewhere . I can handle it better if I know how things are . All I know of the Bacaudae is that they 're vagabond gangs of runaway serfs , slaves , every sort of riffraff . I mean , that 's all I 've heard . Is there more to it ? " Rufinus stared down at the big , blunt-featured , auburn-haired man . " You 're a deeper one than you make out , " he said low . " I 'd give a bit to learn what your business really is . But  --  Look here . What I 've got to tell wo n't please you . It 'll be the truth , but the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't want any either . Say what you will , and if I get angry , I 'll hold it in . I may or may not believe you , but . . . I 've had worse foes than you . " Rufinus 's smile glistened forth , bad though his teeth were . " The same right back at you , Gratillonius ! Let 's . " He lowered himself . The centurion rose in turn . " How about some wine to help our tongues along ? "  --  The tale came out in shards . Sometimes Rufinus japed , sometimes he struggled not to weep . Gratillonius plied him with drink and questions , and meanwhile tried to fit events together in his mind . Later he would try to understand . Rufinus was born to a smallholder near the latifundium of Maedraeacum in the canton of the Redones , about twenty miles northwestof Condate Redonum . Albeit impoverished , the family was closeknitand had its joys . Rufinus , the youngest , especially liked herding swine in the woods , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet even before his birth , the vise was closing . The best of the land had been engulfed by the manors . Imperial regulation made needed goods costly when they were available at all . Such transactions were generally furtive , while farmers had no choice but to sell their produce openly , under strict price control . Meanwhile taxes climbed out of sight . Rufinus 's father more and more sought refuge in the cup . Finally , his health destroyed , he coughed himself to death one winter . Rather than let children of hers be sold into slavery for back taxes , the widow conveyed the farm to Sicorus , owner of Maedraeacum , and the family became his coloni  --  serfs . They were bound to the soil , compelled to deference and obedience , required to do labor for their lord and , after working for themselves , pay more than half the crop over to him . Theirp376grain they must have ground at his mill and at his price . There were no more forest days for Rufinus . Thirteen years old , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashake with weariness . The following year his pretty older sister Ita became the concubine of Sicorus . She could not be forced , under the law . However , he could offer easements for her kin  --  such as not assigning her brothers to the most brutal tasks  --  and for her it was a way out of the kennel . Rufinus , who adored her , stormed to the manor house to protest . The slaves there drove him off with blows . He ran away . Sicorus coursed him down with hounds , brought him back , and had him flogged . The law permitted chastisement of contumacious coloni . For another year , he bided his time . Whispers went along the hedges and in the woodlots ; men slipped from their hovels to meet by twilight ; news seeped across this narrow horizon . It came oftenest on the lips of wanderers who had made their lifework the preaching of sedition . The Empire had rotted to worthlessness , they said ; Frankish laeti at Redonum sacrificed human beings to heathen Gods ; raiders harried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East . Meanwhile the fat grew fatter , the powerful grew ever more overbearing . Had not Christ Himself denounced the rich ? Was not the hour overpast to humble them and take back what they had wrung from the working poor ? The Last Day drew nigh , Antichrist walked the world ; your sacred duty was to resist him . Righteous men had sworn themselves to a brotherhood , the Bacaudae , the Valiant ... . Ita 's death in childbed was the last thing Rufinus endured . After that , he planned his next escape carefully , and found his way to the nearest Bacauda encampment.  --  " We 're no saints , oh , no , no , " he hiccoughed . By then he was fairly drunk . " I learned that soon enough . Some amongst us are beasts of prey . The rest 're rough . I give you that . But the most of us , the most of us , we only wanted to live in peace . We only wanted to till our plots of ground , and keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . " " How do you live ? " Gratillonius asked . He had matched the Gaul stoup for stoup , but he was larger and not half starved . " Oh , we hunt . What a pleasure that is , when we know we 're poaching ! We raise a little garden truck in the wilds . We rob when we can , from the rich , like that flittering smug trader today , but we swap the loot in honest wise for what we need . And merchants who pass through sections , regular-like , where we are , they pay toll . They 're not s'posed to , but they do , undercover , and save ' emselves trouble . And our own people , serfsp377who 've not fled and what few small freehold farmers are left , they help us out , for love . " " For love . Indeed . " Gratillonius made his voice heavy with sarcasm . " I 'm a farm boy myself . I know farmers . What you say sounds exactly like them . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's only right for them to pay their share . Food , clothes , that sort of thing . Besides , we protect ' em against bandits . " Gratillonius shrugged . He could well imagine what their protection consisted of . Cotters who declined it were apt to find their roofs ablaze or their throats slit . Rufinus read his thought and said defensively , " It can be for love . How d' you think I got this outfit of mine ? " By charm , Gratillonius imagined . This young man had an abundance of that . Let him enter the drabness that was the life of some isolated , poverty-stricken wife  --  in and out of it , like bursts of sunshine when wind drove clouds across heaven , like an elf by moonlight  --  If every Bacauda were as glib , the band today would have looked a great deal less scruffy . Still , said Gratillonius 's stubborn mind , Rufinus was in fact as neat and clean as possible in his kind of existence : which revealed something about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . " Well , then , have you Bacaudae a secret kingdom that considers itself at war with Rome , the way the Persians usually are ? That does n't square with what I 've heard . But tell me . " " M-m , no , not really , " Rufinus admitted . " We do have emperors  --  an emperor for each region  --  but he does n't do much except lead his own group and be at the head of the gatherings , when several groups meet . We call the head of any other band its duke . " His sardonic tone implied that the title did n't mean " leader " but was a deliberate parody of Roman organization . " I 'm the duke of mine . " " A bit young for that , are n't you ? " " There are no old Bacaudae , " Rufinus said quietly . Gratillonius rememberedAlexander of Macedon . For that matter , he himself was twenty-five when he became King of Ys . " We do make our deals , " the Gaul went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his head . " I 've heard of bargains struck with Scotian or Saxon . Our folk 'd guide ' em to a manor , they 'd sack it but in return let the serfs be . And I got friendly with a Scotian  --  fled his homeland , he did , on account of a feud , and came to us  --  he told me ' bout Hivernia , where Rome never ruled , where they 've always been free  --  "  |p378Rufinus  started , stiffened , once more shook himself . " I 'd better not go on , " he said . " I might let too much slip out . You 're a good fellow , Gra  --  Gra  --  Gradlon . But I ca n't let you in on any secrets of the brothers , could I , now ? " He picked up his cloak and lurched to his feet . " G'night . I wish we could be friends . " " I 'll take you past the sentries , " the soldier offered , rising too . He would have liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might suddenly make this two-legged wildcat lash out , and his duty was to get the bishop back unharmed . They walked together into the windy dark , mute . As they parted , they clasped hand to arm.  |p379About  fifteen miles west of Augusta Treverorum there was an official hostel where Gratillonius decided to spend the night , even though sundownwas still a couple of hours off . This was doubtless the last such place till he reached the city . Starting at dawn , with nothing to do except swallow breakfast and strike tents , the soldiers should reach their destinationearly enough next day that he would have no trouble getting them settled in and word of his arrival borne to the Emperor . Besides , he might find no suitable campground between here and there . The hills roundaboutwere largely given over to vineyards , with scant room between rows . Hazed and dreamy under the declining sun , this country seemed to lie in a different world from Armorica , as did most of what he had passed through . It was as if wars , brigands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmares . As was common , the hostel maintained an open space for military parties . Having seen his established and supper cooking , Gratillonius sought the house . The dignity of his mission required that he avail himself of it , whether or not it was the kind of fleabag he had found too often along the way . A man stood outside . He had come forth when the legionaries arrived and watched them set up . As Gratillonius neared , he lifted a hand and said , " Greeting , my son . Peace be with you . " His Latin had an odd accent ; he could not be a native Gaul , though it shortly turned out that he used Gallic idioms with ease . Gratillonius halted . Dignity also required he return courtesy , no matter how poor and unkempt the person was who offered it . This one did n't cringe or whine , either . He stood straight , spoke levelly , and looked youp380square in the eye . " Greeting , uncle . "  --  what soldiers usually called an elderly man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . The stranger smiled . " Ah , that takes me far back . I was in the army once . Let me compliment you on the smartness of your squadron . Sadly rare these days . Not many units of old-fashioned regulars left , are there ? " " Thank you , " Gratillonius looked closer . The other carried his years well . While slenderness had become gauntness , the shoulders were wide and unbowed , and if his gait was no longer lithe it remained firm . A snub nose marked a face pallid , lined , and gaptoothed , which you barely noticed after meeting its brilliant blue gaze . Puzzlement rose in Gratillonius . Why should somebody like that , clearly well-educated , go in a coarse dark robe , hardly fit for a slave , belted with a rope underneath a camel-hair cloak  --  when his footgear was stout though well-worn , bespeaking many leagues of use ? Had he fallen into poverty ? Then he should at least have had the pride left to keep himself clean . Streams , ponds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact laved hands and feet , but Gratillonius could smell him . Pungentrather than sour , declaring that he spent much time in the open , the odor nevertheless demeaned him . . . did it not ? He shaved , but probablyseldom , for white stubble covered jaws and cheeks . Likewise it bristledover the front half of his pate . Behind , hair rose wildly ; it would have waved in the breeze if he had washed it . " Well , you 'll want to inspect your quarters before we eat , " he said . " Shall we go in ? " Gratillonius stared . " You 're lodging here ? " The old man smiled . " I 'd rather sleep under God 's stars or the roofs of His poor , but  --  " he shrugged  --  " a bishop traveling a main highway is n't allowed that . " Gratillonius stood a moment in his neat Roman outfit , confronting the beggarly figure , and wondered whether he had heard aright . Arator had been bedraggled when the Bacaudae released him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take him long after reaching Juliomagus to reappear bathed , barbered , and resplendent . " A bishop ? " " Unworthy though I be . Martinus of Caesarodunum Turonum , at your service . May I ask your name , my son ? " Gratillonius stammered it forth , together with his rank and his legion , scarcely hearing himself . His head was awhirl . " You are a long way from your home base , eh ? I think we shall have considerable to talk about . Come . " Martinus took him by the elbow and led him inside . While he changed clothes in his room , Gratillonius tried to put hisp381thoughts in order . Only recently had he first heard of yonder person , bu what he had heard was extraordinary . Passing through the Liger valley , he had observed that the small pagal temples that elsewhere dotted the landscape were absent , or made int ( heaps of stone and charred timber . Occasionally he went by the stump o a tree that had been huge and ancient ; occasionally he spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hilltop which must have been a sacred site where now a single man dwelt . Curious , the centurion had inquire ( among people he met when he stopped for a night . He learned that thi bishop of Turonum and a troop of monks had been going about for years not only preaching their Christ to the rural population but destroying the halidoms of the old Gods and rededicating these to the new . " A great and wonderful work ! " cried devout young Budic . At last hi faith was marching out of the cities . " Hm , " said Gratillonius . " The wonder is that the people stand for it . ' Well , he reflected , this Martinus did have the Imperium at his back Gratillonius himself was technically violating the law when he wor shipped Mithras . Had the heathens killed the churchmen , they woul ( have risked terrible punishment . Still , they might have resisted in other ways . Gratillonius well knew how stubborn and sly rustics could be . It seemed as if Martinus overwhelmed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure how much belief to give stories of miracle : wrought by the holy man . They said he healed the sick , the lame , and th ( blind by his touch and his prayers , that he had even recalled a dead boy t ( life . They said that once , demanding a hallowed oak be cut down , he hac accepted a challenge to stand , bound , where it would fall ; as it toppled , h ( lifted his hand and it spun about and crashed in the opposite direction narrowly missing and instantly converting the clustered tribesfolk . Mayb ( so . Gratillonius had seen strange things wrought by his Gallicenae . He thought , though , most of the force must lie in Martinus himself The bishop was humble as well as strong . He dwelt outside the city , in community of like-minded men whom his reputation had drawn to him Mainly they devoted themselves to worship and meditation . When the went forth evangelizing , Martinus never ranted or threatened . People tol ( Gratillonius that he spoke to them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorous . They told of an incident : he and his fol lowers had torched a Celtic temple , but when the flames were about t ( spread to the landowner 's adjoining house , the bishop led the firefighting effort . He had never desired his office . When it fell vacant , a trick brought hin from his peaceful monastery elsewhere , and a crowd fell upon him an (  |p382carried  him off , willy-nilly , to be consecrated . That was the second time he had been conscripted . The first was long before , he a lad in Pannonia who only wanted to enter the Church , borne away at the instigation of his pagan father and enrolled in the army . Not until the twenty-five-year hitch was up could he give his oath to his God . Thereafter he had been clergyman , hermit , monk  --  Had that God chosen this means of training him for his mission ? Or was it only , or also , that the Gods of the land were failing , that in some secret way folk knew they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forsquilis had said in Ys ... . He re-entered the main room as the kitchen help were bringing out supper . Martinus 's entourage sat at table . They amounted to four men , younger than their leader but tonsured and dressed like him . The bishop sat offside , on a three-legged milking stool he had evidently taken along , and ate from a bowl on his lap . The food he had ordered for them consisted of vegetables , herbs , and a few scraps of dried fish stewed together . Prayers preceded the repast . A reading from the Gospels , by a brother who fasted that evening , accompanied it . Gratillonius ate his robust fare in silence . Afterward Martinus beckoned him over , proffered a bench , and said cordially , " Now , centurion , do you care to tell us what you 've been doing ? You must have many curious adventures under your belt . " Gratillonius dug in his heels against liking the man , found himself dragged toward it anyhow , and settled down . " I am . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I thought so . And we are bound home after business with him . Maybe we can help each other , you and I. " " Sir ? " " I can give you an idea of what to expect . There 's been trouble at court , a most cruel strife . God willing , it nears its end , but you 'll do best to avoid certain topics . For my part , I 'd be very interested to learn more about how things are in Armorica . . . and Ys . " Martinus laughed at Gratillonius 's startlement . " Obvious ! " he continued . " In Treverorum I heard incidental mention that Maximus Augustus'sprefect at the mysterious city was coming . Who else would you be , you who identified yourself as belonging to a Britapnic legion ? Take your ease , have a fresh cup of the excellent local wine , and yam to us . " He and his companions did not join in , sipping merely water , but Gratilloniusgot from them a sense of cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard task . He used his own call for more drink to buy time for thought.  |p383How  much dared he relate ? He had shaded his dispatches to the Emperor , omitting details of religious and magical practices . He had spenl hours on the road rehearsing in his mind how he should reply to various possible questions . He would not give his commandant any falsehood . But if he provoked outrage and cancellation of his commission , what then ? " Well , " he said , " you must be aware that we 're getting matters under control in our part of the country . We 'd like to help with that over a wider range . " The tale of his brush with the Bacaudae and the deliverance of Bishop Arator , augumented by the exclamations and thanksgivings of the monks , took a usefully long while . He went on to remarks about the revival of trade that was beginning , and finished quickly : " But it 'll soon be dark , and I want to start off at daybreak . You mentionedthings I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martinus frowned . " The full story would take longer than till bedtime , my son . " " I 'm a simple roadpounder . Ca n't you explain enough in a few words ? " The ghost of a smile crossed Martinus 's lips . " You ask for a miracle . But I 'll try . " He pondered before he started talking . Nonetheless Gratillonius was bewildered . He could only gather that one Priscillianus , bishop of Avela in Hispania , was accused of heresy and worse . The centurion knew that " heresy " meant an incorrect Christian doctrine , though it was not clear to him who decided what was correct and how . In a vague fashion he was conscious of the division between Catholics , who held that God and Christ were somehow identical , and Arians , who held that They were somehow different . Mithraism was an easier faith , its paradoxes a part of the very Mystery and in any event nothing that directly concerned mortals . This Priscillianus preached a canon of perfectionism which Martinus felt went too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace . Yet Martinus also felt that this was no more than an excess of zeal . Certainly it spoke against those charges of fornication and sorcery that the enemies of Priscillianus brought . There might have been no large stir had not people by the hundreds and perhaps thousands , despairing of this world , flocked to the austere new creed . As was , Bishop Ambrosius of Mediolanumgot the then co-Emperor Gratianus to issue a rescript banning its adherents . They scattered and concealed themselves . Priscillianus himself and a few followers went to Rome to appeal to the Pope . Among them were women , including two friends of the consul Ausonius . This gave rise to nasty gossip . The Church had adopted a rule that when internal disputes arose , thep384final appeal would be to the bishop of Rome . Pope Damasus refused to see Priscillianus . The accused proceeded to Mediolanum , where through an official who was an enemy of Ambrosius they got a rescript restoring them to their churches . Then they took the offensive , getting charges of calumny levelled against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Treverorum and found an ally in the praetorian prefect . Intrigues seethed . Maximus revolted and overthrew Gratianus . Ambrosius traveled north to help negotiate the treaty that divided the West . Ithacius brought his allegations against Priscillianus before the new Augustus . Maximus ordered a synod convened at Burdigala to settle the matter . Much ugliness ensued , rumors of immorality , a noblewoman stoned by a rabble . In the end , Priscillianus refused to accept the jurisdictionof the synod and appealed to the Emperor in Treverorum . Prelates flocked to the scene , Martinus among them . While he did not say so , Gratillonius got the impression , which later conversations confirmed , that he alone did not fawn on Maximus . Rather , he argued stiffly for what he held to be justice . When the Augustus had him at table and ordered the communal wine cup brought first to him , Martinus did not pass it on to Maximus , but to the priest who was with him ; and the Augustus accepted this as a righteous act . Ithacius saw his religious accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , criminal charges of sorcery and Manicheanism . Martinus took the lead in disputing these . He won from Emperor Maximus a promise that there would be no death penalties . However much the Priscillianists might be in error , it was honest error and deserved no worse than exile to some place where they could meditate untroubled and find their way back to the truth . Gladdened , Martinus started home . The whole wretched business had caused him to neglect his own flock far too long.  --  " Wretched ' is the right word , " Gratillonius muttered . " What ? " asked Martinus . " Oh , nothing . " Gratillonius 's glance went to a window . Deep yellow , the light that came through it told him that it was time for his sunset prayer to the Lord Mithras . Besides , after what he had heard , he needed a few lungfuls of clean air . " Excuse me if I leave , " he said , rising . " I 've duties to see to before nightfall . " The monks took that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held him in place like a fishhook before murmuring , " Duties , my son , or devotions ? "  |p385Gratillonius  felt his belly muscles tighten . " Is there a difference ? " " Enough , " said Martinus . Was the motion of his hand a blessing ? " Go in peace . " The squadron entered Augusta Treverorum by one of two paved ways passing through a gate in the city wall . That gate was a colossus of ironboundsandstone blocks , more than a hundred feet wide and nearly as high , with twin towers flanking two levels of windows . Behind it , structureswell-nigh as impressive showed above roofs closer to hand , basilica , Imperial palace , principal church ; and approaching , the men had noticed an amphitheater just outside that was like a shoulder of the hill into which it was built . Facades reared grandly over streets , porticos gleamed around marketplaces , where people in the multiple thousands walked , rode , drove , jostled , chattered , chaffered , exhorted , quarreled , postured , pleaded , vowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thudded , wheels groaned , hammers rang . The noises were a veritable presence , an atmosphere , filled with odors of smoke , food , spice , dung , perfume , wool , humanity . Litters bore a senator in purple-bordered toga and a lady  --  or a courtesan ?  --  in silk past a Treverian farmer in tunic and trousers , a housewife in coarse linen carrying a basket , an artisan with his tools and leather apron , a porter under his yoke , a guardsman on horseback , slaves in livery and slaves in rags , a pair of strolling entertainers whose fantastical garb was an extra defiance of the law that said they must remain in that station to which they were bornGratillonius had seen Londinium , but it could not compare with this . Abruptly Ys seemed tiny and very dear . He got directions and led his soldiers in formation , giving way to nobody . Before their armor the crowds surged aside in bow waves and eddies . Space was available at the metropolitan barracks . Maximus kept a large household troop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn from border garrisons as well as from Britannia . However , more men , auxiliaries among them , had departed for the South with Valentinianus . Thus total Roman strength in Gallia was much reduced . Echoing rooms and empty parade grounds , in the midst of civilian wealth and bustle , roused forebodings in Gratillonius . The Mosella had only about a hundred miles to flow from here before it met the Rhenus ,  |p386and  east of that great river laired the barbarians . Many were already west of it . He made arrangements for his men . Several whooped joyously when they recognized acquaintances from Britannia , and everybody was chafingto be off into town . " Keeping them taut wo n't be easy , " Gratillonius warned Adminius . " Temptations right and left , starting with booze and broads , leading on toward brawls . " The deputy grinned . " Do n't you worry , sir , " he answered . " I 'll let ' em ' ave their fun , but they 'll know there 's a ' and on the tether . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being overbold , maybe the centurion 'd like ' is own bit o ' fun ? I 'll soon find out where that 's to be ' ad . " " Never mind , " Gratillonius snapped . " Remember , I want you reporting to me regularly at my lodging . " He proceeded alone to the government inn where he would stay . Temptation  --  aye , he thought , it simmered in him too ; and he realized he had been thinking in Ysan , while certain of his wives stood before him , unclad and reaching out , more vivid than the walls and traffic around . The room he took was clean and well-furnished , if a little time-faded . He unpacked and got busy . First he must notify the palace of his arrival . He had already prepared a note to that effect  --  writing never came easily to him  --  and now tied it together with a commendation that Bishop Arator had given him . That letter was embarrassingly fulsome , but explainedhis not coming sooner and , well , should do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished in Ys , if ever he wasHe did n't want to pursue that vision . Hastily , he sought the manager of the house , who dispatched a messenger boy for him . As Gratillonius then stood wondering what to do , a uniformed centurionentered from the street , stopped , gaped , and shouted his name . " Drusus ! " he roared back at the stocky form  --  Publius Flavius Drusus of the Sixth , whose unit had side by side with his fought its way out of a Pictic ambush . They fell into each other 's arms , pounded each other 's backs , and exchanged mighty oaths . " I 'm staying here too , " Drusus explained , " waiting to deliver a report . Since we won his throne for the Augustus , my vexillation 's been stationed at Bonna . Reinforcement for the Fifth Minervia . The war whittled that legion pretty badly , not so much through casualties as because most of it stuck with Valentinianus . The Germani got so uppity that at last we made a punitive expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; pretty good . Come , we 've daylight left , let 's go out on the town . "  | " I 'm supposed to report , like you , " Gratillonius demurred . " I 'd better be here when they call me . " Laughter rattled from Drusus . " Your heels will freeze if you just sit waiting , old buddy . I thought today I 'd finally gotten my summons , but no , they told me there the Emperor was suddenly too busy again . You 'll be lucky if you 're called inside this month . And if the word happens to come when you 're out , no sweat . Everything 's scheduled hours and hours in advance , because whenever some backlog of state business can get handled , there 's so much of it . Enjoy while you 've got the chance . I 'll go change clothes and be right with you . " Gratillonius sat worrying till his friend returned , and asked as they went forth : " What 's happened ? Maximus did n't allow this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Drusus replied . " You remember how he alwaysoversaw as much as possible personally . Well , he 's the same now that he wears the purple . And it worked for a while . Name of Christ , how we sliced through Gratianus 's ranks ! But being Emperor is different , I guess . He keeps getting interrupted by new problems . " " Why does he want a direct account of a border clash ? " Gratillonius wondered . " M-m , do n't quote me . I could get in trouble . " " I would n't do that to you , Drusus . D' you imagine I 've forgotten that day in the rain ? All the puddles were red . " Hand squeezed shoulder . " I remember too . Well , nobody 's told me anything officially , understand , but when a smell comes downwind I can usually tell whether it 's from a rose or a fart . After Gratianus died  --  and he was murdered , make no doubt of that , murdered when he 'd been promised safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Drusus glanced about . They were anonymous in a throng of people intent on their own lives . " Maximus put the blame on his cavalry commander , but never punished the man . . . . Anyway . While negotiations were going on afterward , Maximus got the Juthungi to invade Raetia . He had connections to them . Pressure on Theodosius to make a settlement . Valentinianus is only a kid , under the thumb of his mother . But her Frankish general in his turn got the Huns and Alani to harry the Alemanni so close to the Rhenusthat Maximus had to move troops to that frontier . " Which is why I 'm still posted yonder , and the Augustus is anxious about whatever the barbarians may be up to , and why . They 've gotten a taste of playing us Romans off against each other . " Gratillonius raised a dam against the words that rose in his throat.  |p388What  was this fellow saying about their Duke , the man who rolled midnightback from the Wall ? Gratillonius told himself that a commander could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidably had its dirty side , and Drusus was a solid sort who might be misled but who should be heard out before any arguments began . " Well , however that is , " he said , " why are n't things better organized here ? It does n't sound a bit like Maximus . Ca n't he get competent officers any longer ? " " It 's the Priscillianus mess , " Drusus answered . " Before then , we had a pretty smooth mill running . But since that rift spread this far  --  " He paused before he sighed and added , " I do n't understand any miserablepart of it . This town 's full of jabber about the First Cause , the Sons of God and the Sons of Darkness , Spiritual Man , mystical numbers , and I do n't know what else , except I was there when a man got knifed in a tavern ruckus that started over whether or not the age of prophecy is over . I think Priscillianus has to be wrong when he says men and women should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says . I do n't know . But why all these fights about it ? I wonder if Christ in Heaven is n't weeping at what they 're doing in His name . Sometimes I almost envy infidels like you . " They had wandered down toward the river . Through an open portal they saw the bridge across it , and vineyards and villas beyond . A fresh dampness blew off it . Leaves blazed with autumn . Gratillonius rememberedBodilis reading to him a poem Ausonius had written in praise of this stream ; the author had sent her a copy . Like a girl-child playing with her hair before a mirror , fisher lads sport with shadowy shapes underwater . Sudden laughter welled up in him and he pitched away the cares of the world . They 'd climb back onto him soon enough . " Not our department , " he said . " How about we find us a place where we can have a drink and swap brags ? " Four days later he was in the presence of Maximus Augustus , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Emperor , who had promised clemency for the Priscillianists , was rehearing the entire case . Bishop Ithacius withdrew as prosecutor . It was said that he feared the wrath of such powerful colleagues as Martinus and Ambrosius.  |p389Earlier  , the bishop of Mediolanum had come back this far north , ostensiblyto see the bones of Gratianus returned to Italy for burial , actually to attend the first trial . Maximus refused him a private audience but received him in consistory , where he in his turn declined the Emperor 's proffered kiss of peace and accused the latter of being a lawless usurper . Maximus responded in the course of proceedings with a denial that Valentinianus was his equal ; if nothing else , the boy-Emperor and his mother were known to have strong Arian leanings . Though Ambrosius had since gone home , the qualms of Ithacius were natural . In his place , Maximus appointed Patricius , an advocate for the treasury . Did the Augustus want the property of the heretics ? Gratillonius found a military tribune who was a reliable conduit of information , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church perturbed him less than what he learned about Maximus . How long must he hang around this cursed city ? Most of his time he spent sightseeing , or talking with chance-met men . They were a varied lot , many of them trading up and down the rivers or overland . There grew before him a vision , clearer than ever , of the Empire , how vast it was and how troubled . The detachment came for him toward evening , when he had lately returned to the hostel after a day 's ride in the hinterland . A vintner had hailed him and invited him home for a cup and a gab ; there the pretty daughter of the house smiled upon him . Now he sat in the common room prior to supper , more content than he had been , thinking back over the small experience . The door opened . Four soldiers in combat gear tramped through , and at their head a centurion . " We seek Gaius Valerius Gratillonius , of the Second Legion Augusta , " that man announced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as fast as his body . " In the name of the Augustus , come . " " At once . I 'll just outfit myself  --  " " No . Immediately . " Gratillonius stared into faces gone hard . A prickling went over his scalp . " Is something wrong ? " he asked . The centurion clapped hand to sword . " Silence ! Come ! " Household staff gaped , shrank aside , and saw their guest depart surrounded by armed men . Folk outside likewise fell silent as the group strode down the streets to the basilica . Guarded gates led to a cloistered courtyard where dusk was rising : for the sun had gone below the outer walls . Light still glowed on the upper courses of brick and red sandstone that made up the great buildingp390within , and flared off glass in its windows . Numb , Gratillonius accompaniedhis escort into this citadel of his hopes , past several checkpoints and thus at last to the audience hall where the Emperor was . The soldiers clanked to a halt and saluted . Gratillonius did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne , the same Hispanic hatchet features and lean body though purple be wrapped around and a golden wreath set above . He hardly noticed the splendor of the room or the several councillors who sat or stood beneath their master . The officer waited for the Imperial nod before reporting that he brought the person required . " Ah , Gratillonius , " Maximus said low . " Step forward . Let us look at you . " The King of Ys posed for what seemed a long while , until he heard : " Know that we have been told such evil of you that we have ordered your arrest . What have you to stay for yourself ? " Despite foreknowing he was somehow in danger , Gratillonius felt as if clubbed . " Sir ? " Breath sobbed into him . He braced his knees , gave Maximuseye for eye , and declared , " My lord , I have served you and Rome to the best of my ability . Who 's spoken ill of me ? " Maximus straightened and clipped , " Your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them liars ? Do you deny having trafficked with Satan ? " " What ? Sir  --  my lord  --  I do n't understand . My men  --  " " Silence . " Maximus nodded at a pinch-lipped person in a drab tunic . " Calvinus , read the report . " That one took up a set of papers and began what soon became a singsong , like a chant to his God . It developed that he was high in the Imperialsecret service . His agents were everywhere , in every walk of life , with instructions to keep alert for anything the least suspicious and follow it up until they had sufficient clues to warrant full investigation . As if across a sea , Gratillonius heard how his legionaries , innocently talking in barracks and around town , had spoken of him . There was no need to interrogate any of them ; all were ready to boast about their leader and about the wonders of Ys . Gratillonius heard how he , in a pagan ceremony where the images of devils were brought forth , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had accepted and openly borne the emblems of a sea demon and a demon of the air . He had sent forth a spirit in the form of a bird to spy upon his enemies . He had ordered magic to raise a storm . He had betrodden an island that was from time immemorial the site of the blackest sorceryCourtiers shivered and made signs against malevolence . Lips moved inp391whispered prayer . The squad that had taken Gratillonius kept martial stiffness , but sweat came forth ; he saw it , he smelled it . At the end , Maximus leaned forward . " You have heard the charges , " he said . " You must realize their gravity , and the necessity we are under of finding the truth . Sorcery is a capital offense . The powers of darkness have reached into the very Church ; and you are a defiant unbeliever , who bears upon himself the mark of it . " What mark ? He had left the Key of the gate behind in Ys , as being too vital to risk anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was closecroppedlike a Roman 's . He did wear his hair in Ysan male style , long , caught at the nape to fall down in a tail .... He clawed out of his bewilderment and thought Maximus must refer to the brand of Mithraic initiation on his brow , though it had faded close to invisibility and  --  and Mithraists were loyal Romans . " You may speak , " the Emperor said . Gratillonius squared his shoulders . " Sir , I 've practiced no wizardry . Why , I would n't know how . The Duke  --  the Augustus always knew what my religion is , and it does n't deal in magic . They believe differently in Ys , true . Well , given my job , how could I keep from showing respect to their Gods ? I did  --  I did ask help from whatever powers they might have , but that was against barbarians who menaced Rome . As for that time on Sena , the island Sena , I was n't supposed to set foot on it , but my wife  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat locked on him . His eyes blurred and stung . " You may be honest . " Maximus 's tone was steady ; and did it hold a slight note of regret ? " We had cause for confidence in you , and therefore entrusted you with your mission . But if nothing else , you may have been seduced by the Evil One . We must find out . God be praised , now that the Priscillianus matter nears an end , we have had a chance to hear this news of you . And we have given it prompt consideration as much for your sake  --  Gratillonius , who did serve valiantly on the Wall  --  as for Rome 's . We will pray that you be purged of sin , led to the Light , saved from perdition . " Abruptly the old military voice rang forth . " If you remain a soldier , obey your orders ! " He issued instructions . The squad led Gratillonius away.  |p392In  the early morning he was brought from the cell where he had spent a sleepless night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met a procession under heavy guard . At its front walked a gray-haired man , skeletal , eyes fixed luminous upon another world . Four men came after , and a middle-aged woman and a younger who held hands . All were in coarse and dirty garb . They moved stumblingly , because they had not only been half starved but severely tortured . They stank . Lanterns burned smoky in the dank air around them . Hoarsely , they tried to sing a hymn . " The heresiarch and those followers of his who 've been condemned , " said one of Gratillonius 's guards to him . " They 're off to the chopping block . Have a care , fellow , or you 'll be next . "  --  Light was dim also in the interrogation chamber . Gratillonius could just identify scenes of the Christian hell painted on its plaster . How neatly the instruments and tools sat arranged . This could have been an artisan 's workshop . Nothing felt quite real , except the chill . Two men waited , the first skinny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief tunic , ready for action . They studied the prisoner impersonally . He heard through a buzzing in his head : "  --  by command of the Augustus . Cooperate , and this may be the only session we 'll need . Otherwise we will be forced to take strict measures . Do you understand ? We 're coping with none less than Satan  --  " Surprised at his meekness ( but resistance would have been of no avail , when he was so alone ) , Gratillonius undressed . His nudity made him feel twice helpless . The torturer secured him in a frame so that he stood spread-eagled and took a lead ball off a shelf . It dangled at the end of a thong . Meanwhile the questioner continued talking , in an amicable voice . "  --  your duty to help lay bare the work of Satan . We do not wish to harm you . Simply as a warning  --  " Snapped by an expert hand , the ball smote Gratillonius 's elbow . Agony went jagged up that arm . He strangled a scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , in your own words  --  " Whenever he resisted or equivocated , not that he meant to play games but often he was n't sure how to respond , the blow landed , on joints , belly , the small of the back , until he was a single slab of pain ; and worst was that the next attack might come between his sprangled thighs . Weirdest was that , from time to time , the proceedings would stop , they wouldp393bring him water , the torturer would sponge the sweat off him while the questioner chatted about everyday things . Mithras , Who hates a liar , give me to cling to the truth ! "  --  I did n-n-no such deed , ever . Others may have , I do n't know about that , I 'm just a soldier , but it was for Rome , everything I did was for Rome . " " He might want a taste of the hook , " said the torturer thoughtfully . The questioner considered . " Once . " When the barbs went into his thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be raped . " But I can not tell you more ! " " You 've said a good deal already , boy . " " All I could . All . " And never screamed , Gratillonius thought blurrily . Never screamed . That much pride is left me . But I do n't know if I can keep it after my arms and legs crack out of their sockets on yonder rack , or when he starts hitting me in my manhood . " Well , " said the questioner with a smile , " that will do for today . Please remember how much the state needs your cooperation , you , a soldier ; and think what it means to your salvation . " The torturer fetched salves and bandages and set about dressing open wounds . " You have n't suffered any permanent damage , you realize . I pray God you do n't , dear soul . " The questioner stroked the prisoner 's wet hair . " But that depends on you . " He called the guards to bring Gratillonius back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing happened except diminishing soreness and horrible expectations , suddenly he was brought forth . The person in charge was unctuous though uncommunicative . Gratillonius would see the Emperor ! First he must needs be bathed , groomed , properly attired ... . This time Maximus sat in a room small and plainly furnished , himself simply clad , behind a table littered with papers and wax writing tablets . Apart from two soldiers at the door and the two that led Gratillonius in , he was unattended . Gratillonius gave him a salute , noticing with faint annoyance how awkward it was in his condition . " Sit down , " the Emperordirected . Gratillonius lowered his weariness onto a stool . Maximus observed him closely before saying , " Well , centurion , how are you today ? "  |p394Something  grinned within Gratillonius . Aloud he answered , " All right , thank you , sir . " " Good . " Maximus ruffled the beard over his craggy chin , stared into space , and proceeded : " You came through interrogation rather well . We 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your rescue of Bishop Arator argues in your favor , too . Not being of the Faith , you failed to see the wiles of Satan before you . Meditate on that ! But your intentions were patriotic . I expected they 'd prove to be . You understand we had to make certain . " Gratillonius spared himself a reply . It would have been too much effort , for no clear purpose . " Now . " Maximus 's gaze swung back to stab at him . " Let us hear what you have to relate about Ys . " Surprised , Gratillonius stammered , " The Augustus . . . has my dis-patches  --  " " If those sufficed , I need n't have brought you here . " Maximus barked a laugh . " Since time is lacking , and you 're in no shape to take the initiative , I must . Listen well and answer clearly . " His questions were shrewd . At the end , he nodded and said , slowtoned : " Aside from your mistakes  --  and we pray you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done a creditable job . We 're minded to keep you at your post . But . " He raised a finger . " But we set restrictions on you . You will not further abet the practice of sorcery in Ys . Do you hear ? You will not . Instead , you , as the prefect of Rome , will do everything in your power to suppress what is diabolical . " A smile quirked his lips . " I know that wo n't be easy . You 're set among pagans , and they seem to be especially obstinate . I 'm not sure any Christiancould handle them at all , and certainly I 've no Christian officer availablewith anything like your capabilities . " He sighed . " I must use whateverGod sees fit to send me . " He grew stem : " We shall not let witches live . Once the last of this Priscillianist obscenity is behind us  --  we 'll be sending agents to Hispania to root it out , down to bedrock  --  once that 's done and the West is secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stewardship . Therefore be zealous . To drive the lesson home , you 'll be led from here to receive five strong lashes , one for each wound that Our Lord suffered upon the Cross . No more , and with an unweighted whip . We are disposed to be merciful . " Gratillonius mustered strength to say , " I thank the Augustus . " " Good , " replied Maximus . " Thereafter you may return to your quartersand recuperate . Use the time well . Think about your errors , seekp395counsel , pray for the grace of the Holy Spirit . Then , whenever you are fit to travel , you may do so . " Dulled though Gratillonius 's mind was , a flickering went through it . He dared not wonder if he was being wise before he said , " Augustus , "  --  how weakly his voice resounded in his skull  --  " you tell me to get advice .. . from learned men . Well , may I search for it elsewhere than here ? " " What ? Where else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Caesarodunum Turonum . They 're devout there , but you might become confused about certain things . " " I meant farther south , sir . To Lugdunum , Burdigala , places where ... where many sages live . " " Are you quite right in your head ? You 're no student , to sit at the feet of philosophers . " " The Augustus knows . . . we need a new Christian minister in Ys . That calls for searching . Not just anyone will do . " Maximus fell into thought . " His appointment is not yours to make , " he said at length , " but the Church will take your recommendation into account , I suppose . You may prove mistaken . Still , the idea is to your credit . " Again he paused . " And as for your personal request  --  well , why not ? It should do your soul good to see more of the Empire , of Christendom , than this Northern fringe . And clergymen who were not involved in the affair here , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You may travel freely , provided you stay within Gallia , conduct yourself properly , and take no longer than , oh , six months until you return to duty . My secretary will prepare a written authorization . " Wistfulness brushed him . " After all , " he said , " we were soldiers together , you and I , soldiers on the Wall . Go with God . " " Thank you , sir , " Gratillonius made himself utter . Maximus 's glance went back to the documents before him . " Dis-missed . " Gratillonius 's guards led him off to the whipping post . Four-and-twenty legionaries , fully encountered , marched out of the rain into the common room of the hostel . They shooed the help away and came to attention , ranked , before the couch where Gratillonius lay on his side to spare his back . Lamplight made their metal gleam against thep396shadows that had stolen in with eventide . As one , they saluted . " Hail , centurion ! " rolled forth . He sat up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he demanded . " By your leave , sir , " Adminius replied , " we 're ' ere for yer judgment . " " What do you mean ? " The deputy must wrench the words out : " We ' eard wot ' append , and ' ow it was our stupid fault . Word 's got around , you see . Sir , w-w-we wants ter make it good , if we can . Only tell us wot ter do . " Budic 's lip quivered . Uncontrollable tears ran down his cheeks . " That I should have betrayed my centurion ! " he nearly screamed . " Quiet , you , " Adminius snapped . " Bear yerself like a soldier . Sir , we await yer orders . If you ca n't tell nobody ter flog us , we 'll do it ter each other . Or anything you want . " " We have n't yet found out who hurt you , " said Cynan starkly , " but when we do , they 're dead men . " Shocked , Gratillonius got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed . " I 'll have none of that . They did their duty , under orders , as Rome expects you will . If anything rates punishment , that notion of yours does . Kill it . " A part of him noticed that he had n't gone dizzy this time , rising . Anger was a strong tonic . But he was recovering pretty fast , too . That knowledgewent through him in a warm wave . He looked upon his men in their misery , and suddenly had to blink back tears of his own . " Boys , " he said with much carefulness , " you 're not to blame . I never instructed you to keep silence , because I never expected trouble myself . Who would have ? And let me say , this show of loyalty damn near makes me glad of what happened . It has n't done me any real damage anyway , aside maybe from a few extra scars . Give me three or four days more , and I 'll be ready for the road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gratillonius shook his head . " Not at once . " " Well , wherever the centurion goes , all ' e 'll need is ter whistle us up . Eh , lads ? " The squadron rumbled agreement . " I 'm not likely to require much of a troop in the South , where I 'm bound , " Gratillonius said , " and as for Ys  --  Shut in here , I 've had time to think . Some of you are very likely homesick , after all your while in foreignparts . I can probably dispense with a Roman cadre , the way things are now set up in Armorica . Before leaving Treverorum , I can try to arrange reassignments for you , to your proper units in Britannia . "  | " Wot , sir ? No ! "  --  " Not me. "  --  " Please , I want to stay . "  --  " We 're your men , sir . " " You 're Rome 's men , " Gratillonius reminded them sharply . Behind his mask of an officer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to their chieftains . Was the Empire breeding its own barbarians ? He thrust the chilling question aside . He could not penalize love . Also , he could not be entirely sure that there would be no further use in Ys for these roadpounders of his . " Well , think it over , and quickly , " he said . " I told you , I 'm starting off soon , and whoever comes with me will be gone a long time . " He drew breath . " Thank you for your faithfulness . Dismissed . " " ' Bout face ! " Adminius barked . " Off ter barracks . I 'll follow shortly . Want a private word with the centurion first . " When the rest had tramped out the door , Gratillonius reseated himself and looked up at the thin face . He saw brashness abashed . " Well , deputy , what do you want ? " he asked . " Um , sir , I do n't mean ter get above myself , but  --  could I speak freely , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gratillonius . He smiled . " Go right ahead . If you overstep , I 'll simply tell you . " " Well , urn  --  " Adminius wrung his hands and stared downward . " Well , sir , " he said in a rush , " the centurion is a man , very much a man , but ' e 's been through a ' ard time , after driving ' imself so ' ard , and now means ter begin again , sooner than wot a medic might call wise . It 's not for me ter tell yer ' ow ter be'ave . But we in the troop do worry about yer . You 're getting your strength back , seems . But where 's any pleasure ? A man ca n't go on forever with no fun , no little rewards ter ' imself . Not unless ' e 's a flinking saint , ' e ca n't . Could I , or anybody , ' elp the centurion to a bit of re-cre-ation ? I 'd be that glad , I would . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food and drink are tolerable in this place , and  --  I am a marked man , who 'd better watch his step . Enough . " " No , not enough ! Listen , sir . I know it would n't do ter bring a woman in ' ere , or anything like that . But if you go out , would a spy follow ? I do n't think so . " Gratillonius chuckled . " I have n't made your acquaintance with the sort of house you have in mind . " " No , sir , you 're a very serious-minded man . But listen , if you would like a bit of sport , let me recommend the Lion 's Den inn at the end of Janus Way . Ca n't miss it . It 's safe , draws a nice class of customer , thep398drinks and the games are honest , the girls are clean , and right now they 've got the damnedest bank of musicians you ever ' eard . That 's if you want , of course . I 've said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , goodnight , sir , and do be good to yerself . " Adminius saluted and bolted . Gratillonius laughed . He had n't done that since his arrest . It was a grand feeling . What a dear bunch of mother hens he led ! At that , he thought , the deputy had a point . Before setting off on what was , after all , business of the most serious , he 'd be well-advised to refresh his spirit , get out of this dull dwelling , to where winds could blow the lingering horrors from his head . A vintner who 'd been hospitable , and his pretty daughterThe girl was doubtless chasteGratillonius felt the stirring in his loins . And that had not happened either , following his imprisonment , until now . Fear about it had begun to nag him . . . . By Hercules , but he 'd been long deprived ! And he 'd spend additional months before coming back to his wives . Into his wives . The visions flamed up . Oh , he 'd been told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ys to possess any but the Gallicenae . That was in Ys , though , hundred of leagues away at the far , lonely end of Armorica , Ys whose Gods he had in his heart forsworn and Who were fading away into myth . What power had They left Them ? As he recalled the comfort that lay in a woman 's arms and breasts , the forgetfulness of self that lay between her legs , his rod lifted fully . When he regained his feet , it stayed firm . He cast hesitation aside , fetched his cloak , and went forth into a fine rain that he thought really should steam off his flesh.  --  She was a big young blond whose guttural accent somehow excited him the more . He did n't quite make out her name , but she told him she was from east of the border . Hard pressed these days , many half-civilized Germani drifted across the Rhenus in search of employment , and often women trailed along . Roman authorities usually looked the other way , what with a labor shortage acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the cup of mead he had bought her , her left began to explore his person . He paid the fee for two turns and they went upstairs . None of his Queens would ever know if he could help it , but if perchance they found out , surely most would understand that a man has needs . A couple of tallow candles burned in the cubicle where her bed was . Their rankness was exciting too , like animals in rut . His memberp399throbbed . She pulled off her gown and stood smiling at him . Her bosom was heavy above a rounded white belly and a patch that the wan light shaded but that gave off brass glints . He scrambled out of his clothes . Then he felt the coldness and the shriveling . His knees shook , his pulse rattled . They lay down and she tried this and that . Nothing availed . Finally she said , " Yell , too bad , but I got to go vork , you know ? " He sighed and nodded . There was no mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward the hostel . It had been foolish not to carry a lantern . The rain fell heavier than before , with a wind to dash it into his eyes and hoot between the walls . Chill sneaked under his cloak . So , he thought . I am once for all the King of Ys . Anywhere I may be , as long as we both shall live . Despite himself , he smiled a bit . Then maybe they 're not mistaken about other things in Ys , he thought . Maybe the soul of Dahilis is still somewhere thereabouts , waiting for me . He could almost believe that something of hers had watched over him . He was in search of the highest consecration to Mithras . His hypocrisy before Maximus still tasted nasty in his mouth , necessary though it had seemed . At least now he was , like it or not , free of any further impurity.  |p400Even  without the need to make fortifications each afternoon and demolishthem next morning , the march to Lugdunum took half a month . It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completerecovery . He had seen what could happen when men overtaxed their healing bodies . Also , he had been unable to obtain sufficient rations for his squadron in Treverorum , but must needs get them piecemeal at way stations . Several were out of commission , which meant delay while soldiers searched and dickered . Maximus 's war had caused some of the damage . More was due to incursions of Franks and Alemanni . The Romanshad succeeded in driving those barbarians out ten years ago , then lacked funds and labor for complete restoration . The countryside was beautiful , but autumn traveled south with the troop , bearing downpours and shivery winds . Journey 's end and roofs overhead felt good indeed . Gratillonius gave his soldiers and himself a few days to rest , see the great city , and take what pleasures were available . He knew they would be close-mouthed , and in any event he had not confided his real purpose to them , except for Adminius . The deputy 's Christianity was nominal , and his boyhood in the Londinium slums had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it best to keep his own inquiries about Mithras worshipincidental to those about possible clergy for Ys . The latter questions were the merest token . He knew full well that such an appointment could only be made in the North . However , if secret agents demanded a report on him , this should satisfy them . Whatever guilt he felt had left him as he sat hour by hour in the saddle or lay alone in his tent at night . It was Maximus who was the betrayer . He had not strengthened the Empire , he had split it asunder as Romanp401slew Roman . He had not given it peace and prosperity , he had raised persecution and fear . He had broken pledge after pledge , to Gratianus , to Martinus , to poor old Priscillianus , to the Senate and the People of Rome ; how long would he keep his to Valentinianus ? He proposed to violate the ancient compact with Ys . Gratillonius disliked practicing deception , but such knowledge about his commandant had eaten away his resistance to it . Seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stately public buildings , baths , theater , and , outside its walls , sculptured tombs , magnificent aqueducts , an artificial lake for mimic sea battles . While many warehouses stood hollow , commerce still flowed along rivers and roads . Though poverty lurked in tenements and alleys , joviality flourished in taverns , foodstalls , bawdyhouses , odeions , the homes of the well-to-do . Few folk seem to worry about much besides their private lives , unless they be devout Christians intent on the afterworld . No Mithraeum survived here , but presently Adminius heard that one was left in Vienna , some twenty miles south . Gratillonius 's spirits lifted . He ordered departure the following day . None of the twenty-four asked why , or what else he had in mind . A considerably lesser city on the left bank of the Rhodanus , Vienna nevertheless possessed its splendors , including a large circus and a temple that Claudius Caesar had erected four hundred years ago . More to the point , military accommodations and civilian amenities were adequate . The troop might be staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and location of Lucas Orgetuorig Syrus , a wine merchant . Walking thither the day after his arrival , Gratilloniusfound a house with a moderately prosperous shop . Syrus proved to be an old man whose features , despite generations of intermingling , bore traces of his family 's Asiatic origin . When Gratillonius gave him the initiate 's grip , his dim eyes widened , then filled with tears , and he came near collapse . Rallying , he took the newcomer to a private room , where Gratillonius made the signs of reverence before speaking those secret words that identified his rank in the Mysteries as Persian . " Be welcome , oh , very welcome , my son , " Syrus quavered . " It 's been so long since any of the faithful appeared who were young and strong . Are there more like you ? " Gratillonius nodded . " Three , Father , men of my company . Two have the rank of Occult . The third joined us a couple of years ago . He 's only a Raven , of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advancement should be swift , when we are so few , so few  --  " The voice trailed off.  | " How can it be , Father , with none superior to me where we 've been ? That 's why I 've sought you , that , and the hope of your blessing . " " The blessing you have , my son , but . . . but let us be seated . I 'll call for refreshment and we 'll talk . Or am I being selfish ? Should I first send for Cotta ? He 's our Runner of the Sun , he deserves to hear . Oh , I must share these glad tidings with him . " " Later , Father , I beg . " Gratillonius assisted the frail form to a bench . " Did you wish drink ? Permit me to call a servant . " Conversation went haltingly . Syrus had not lost his wits , but they were apt to wander , and twice he dozed off for a few minutes as he sat . Gratilloniuslearned this congregation existed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of proselytization . It might have been banned altogether , as the Imperial decree required ; but Syrus 's family had money and his son carried weight in civic affairs . Although himself a Christian , the younger man did not care to see his father 's heart broken . Death would close down the Mysteries soon enough . Gratillonius explained his desire as best he could . " I know it 's a great deal to ask , such a promotion , especially when I ca n't stay here long . It may be impossible . If so , I ask forgiveness for presuming . But if it can be done  --  if I can be raised to your rank , Father  --  why , Ys will have a temple of the God , and full celebration of His rites , proper instruction for the young , elevation of worshippers . The faith will live ! " " A wonderful vision , my son , " Syrus whispered . " Foredoomed , I fear , but wonderful . Mithras , sentry at the frontier of the dark  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " I must think , study , pray . It is irregular . But , but I wish  --  how I wish  --  Can you come to services tomorrowsundown ? Bring your fellow believers . It will be a common rite , they too may take part , and welcome , welcome  --  " Gratillonius gave him an arm and upbore half his weight when he shuffled off to bed.  --  Mithraeums had never been large . The one in Vienna consisted of a single room in Syrus 's house . Its windows had been boarded up and plastered over to simulate a cave . Benches along the walls left just a strip of aisle between . A cord at the entrance end marked off the vestibule . Neither font nor image of lion-headed Time stood there , only a basin for holy water . At the sacrificial end , the Bullslaying and the Torchbearers were merely painted above a table that did duty for an altar . Nothing was squalid ; wax candles gave light , incense sweetened the air . But of the handful of regular attenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feverish chatter beforehand had stopped and men entered this sanctuary , solemnity brooded over it . The lesser members took stancep403behind the cord and made reverence as the higher  --  two Lions , two Persians ( Gratillonius the second ) , the Runner of the Sun , and the Father , all in minimal vestments  --  passed by . The offering was simply wine raised before the Tauroctony . The re-enactment by the two seniors  --  of Mithras overcoming the Sun , then crowning Him to be forever after the Unconquered  --  wasbare-bones simple . The liturgy was brief . Subsequently those forward reclined on the benches while Ravens , Occults , and Soldiers brought the sacred meal and served them . That food , at least , was of the best , within the limits of prescribed austerity . Gratillonius savored it , as being like a sign unto him of the soul 's ascent Heavenward . . . when he had tasted nothing holy but prayers for nigh on three years . Thoughts tumbled through him . Why was he doing this , why was he feeling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no spiritual kin to , say , Martinus of Turonum . Well , but what else had he to cleave to ? The Gods of Achilles , Aeneas , Vercingetorix were dead : phantoms at most , haunting glens and graveyards and the dusty pages of books . The Gods of Ys were inhuman . Christ was a pallid stranger . Rome the Mother was a widow , her husband the Republic and their tall sons long since dead in battle , herself the booty of every bandit who came by . Mithras alone stood fast , Mithras all alone . When they consecrated Gratillonius a Father , he felt weariness drop off him like a cloak of lead unclasped , and himself momentarily victorious . There had been too much he must learn , in too brief a span . He had no gift for acquiring doctrine , words , gestures , arcana ; he must hammer them into his head , toiling till dawn grizzled his window and he fell into a few hours of sleep wherein his dreams gibbered . Meanwhile he must ever strive to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , requiring little more than exercise , cleanliness , and temperance . But his mind was a maniple of barbarian recruits , raw , rebellious , slouching off every which way the instant that the drillmaster 's glance strayed off them . He should have had years for his undertaking and done it openly , while the rest of his life went on in everyday wise . Instead , he rammed his way through the teachings , hoped for godliness , and took precautions against the authorities . Probably no one would ever denounce him . He had entered Vienna quietly , stayed inconspicuous , responded to questions with evasivep404phrases about a confidential assignment . His men knew nothing and ' were content to enjoy themselves  --  aside from Maclavius , Verica , and Cynan , his fellow Mithraists , and Adminius . Those would not give him away . Syrus 's congregation had learned silence . However , somebody else might notice how often Gratillonius visited that particular house . No matter ! he told himself . By the time such gossip reached Treverorum , if it did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his establishmentof a Mithraeum there as an act of rebellion , which it was , but could scarcely do anything about it for another two or three years , during which anything might happen . Live each day as it comes , like a soldier in the field . They raised him to Runner of the Sun and he concelebrated the Mysterywith Syrus . In his exhaustion , he felt only that he had passed a mark on an endless uphill road . But when Syrus and Cotta together had finished the rite that made him Father , and for the first time he  --  with his own hands , farmer 's , soldier 's , woodworker 's hands  --  lifted the chalice before the Tauroctony , and drank the blessed wine  --  then abruptly , blindingly , the sacredness of it came upon him . Did the Sun lift out of the night in his spirit , to blaze in terrible majesty from his heart ? He knew not . As he spoke the words , he wept . Everyone embraced him . " The grace of Mithras be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was impossible , of course . After he left the sanctum , he was merely Gratillonius . What had happened within , he could barely remember . Maybe You will reveal Yourself to me again , God of my fathers , he thought . Or maybe not . I am unworthy of this much . But I will serve You as steadfastly as lies in the power of mortal flesh and grimy soul.  --  The Birthday was not far off . Syrus asked Gratillonius to join him in honoring it . The old man cried a little when he heard that that would be unwise . The legionaries had lingered suspiciously long as it was and must be off straightaway . Gratillonius gave him the kiss of peace , and received it . In the morning the squadron started west toward Burdigala . Gratilloniushad another promise to redeem.  |p405Decimus  Magnus Ausonius smiled . " You show me the lady Bodilis as still more fascinating in person than in correspondence , " he said . " You see , she 's had so many questions for me that I failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard her as a brilliant human being , but one condemned to existence in a stagnant backwater . My mistake . What you have had to tell makes me wonder if Ys may not hold the world 's highest civilization . Were I capable of the journey , I would accompany you there , Gratillonius , and explore it . Oh , that Jupiter might restore to me the years that are fled ! ' " His quotation and the sigh that followed were rueful , though quite without self-pity . " But I talk too much , " he went on . " Better to listen . In a sense , Ys is more distant than the farthest land we know of . That mysterious force which has worked for centuries to erase its name from our chronicles  --  You can remain a while , ca n't you ? Please . " " I should be returning soon , sir , " Gratillonius answered . " You are restless . You hunger for achievement . Well , let us work some energy off you before we dine . " Ausonius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly . Inclement weather had kept people indoors these past two days , during which he  --  after getting his men barrackedin the city  --  had stayed with the poet . Not that he had n't enjoyed himself . Ausonius was delightful company . Still erect and lively in his mid-seventies , he had been more than a famous teacher of rhetoric ; he had been tutor to ill-fated Emperor-to-be Gratianus in Treverorum , afterwardprefect of Gallia , Libya , and Italy , eventually consul . In retirement since Maximus took the throne , he remained active among colleagues , students , civic leaders , a large household and its neighborhood , while from his pen streamed verses and epistles to friends throughout the Empire . Nevertheless it was a special pleasure to step forth on the portico of the rural mansion , flush lungs with fresh air , and look widely around . Rain and sleet had yielded to sunshine which , although slanted from the south , gave January a pledge of springtime . Grounds swept darkling with moisturedown to the bank of the Garumna ; mist smoked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vineyards beyond . On a paved path that the men took , doves moved aside from the sapphire arrogance of a peacock.  | " A slave told me you have several scrolls in your baggage , " Ausonius said . " May I ask what the texts are ? " Gratillonius hesitated . They were from Syrus , aids to his memory of doctrine and rites that a Father must know , and none of lesser rank . When he had no more need of them in Ys , he was to destroy them by fire , with certain prayers . " I 'm sorry . It 's forbidden me to tell . " Ausonius gave him a close regard before murmuring , " You 're not a Christian , are you ? " " I follow the Lord Mithras . " " I suspected as much . Well , I 'm Christian myself , but hold that to be no grounds for scorning the ancients or any upright contemporaries who believe otherwise . Surely God is too great to be comprehended in a single creed , and we mortals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens . " Gratillonius recalled poems of Ausonius that Bodilis had shown him . They were concerned with everyday matters , sometimes humorous , sometimesgrave , sometimcs as when he mourned the death of his wife or a child  --  moving , in a stoic fashion . " Gather you roses , girl , whilst they and you are in flower , remembering how meanwhile time flies from you .... " Hoofbeats drummed . The men turned to look . Up from the riverside galloped a mud-splashed horse , upon it a boy of eight or nine years . " Why , yonder comes Paulinus , " the rhetor exclaimed happily . Gratillonius had met the lad , Ausonius 's grandson , born in Macedonia but now here to get the finest possible education . Being shut in by the rain had made him miserable , despite the elder 's unfailing kindliness . The ride had evidently refreshed him , for he drew rein at his grandfather 's hail and greeted the men in seemly wise . " Are you ready to go back to your books ? " Ausonius asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more first ? " Paulinus begged . His Latin was heavily Greek-accented . " Bucephalus , he 's just getting his second wind . " " Discipline , discipline , you must break yourself to harness before you dare call yourself a man . . . . But in indulging you I indulge myself . Go as you will . Good speed to your young valor , boy ! So shall you mount to the stars ! ' " Ausonius quoted with a chuckle . " Meditate upon that line . It should make Vergilius more interesting to you . " " Thanks ! " Paulinus cried , and was off in a spatter of wet earth . Ausonius clicked his tongue and shook his head . " I really must become stricter with him , " he said . " Else a rhetorician of considerable potential could go to waste . But it is n't easy when I remember his father at that age . " Gratillonius thought of Dahilis and Dahut . " No , it is n't easy , " he saidp407through sudden , unexpected pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . He may well find need for a set of muscles . " " Oh ? Why ? We moderns do n't revere athletes like the Greeks in their glory . His career should resemble mine , writing , teaching , public office . " Gratillonius 's gaze went eastward , toward the Duranius valley through which he had come on his way to Burdigala . Those thickly wooded steeps and hollows lay no great distance hence . Yet little traffic moved there any more , for fear of the robbers who haunted them . " How long do you suppose that sort of life will stay possible ? " he asked harshly . " Why , already  --  when was it ?  --  about twenty-five years ago , the barbarians cut the aqueducts of Lugdunum itself . " Ausonius nodded . " I remember . It caused the taxes to fail that year . " " Did n't it mean any more to you than that ? " " Oh , these are troublous times , admittedly . " The furrows of the old countenance turned downward in sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and daughter met their fate at the hands of the tyrant Maximus . " Ausonius gripped the arm of Gratillonius . " You 've intimated that you were a witness to the evil done in Augusta . If you 've spoken no more about it , I can understand . But the martyrs are safe in heaven  --  we must believe  --  and a measure of justice has since prevailed . " " Really ? " asked the centurion , surprised . " How ? " " You have not heard ? . . . Well , I suppose you scarcely could have , on the road as you were . " ( Or immured in Vienna , Gratillonius did not add . ) " I have received letters , including one from a colleague who is in correspondence with Martinus , the bishop of Caesarodunum . " Gratillonius 's pulse quickened . " I 've met that man . Tell me what hap-pened . " " Why , Martinus was on his way home when he learned of the executionsof the Priscillianists , a breach of Maximus 's promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Augusta and demanded to see the Emperor . That was denied him . But Maximus 's wife , a pious lady , grew terrified , begged Martinus to dine alone with her and discuss it . They say he had never done that with a woman , but consented , and she laved his feet with her tears and dried them with her hair . The upshot was that Maximus did hear Martinus out , a thunderous denunciation , and agreed not to send inquisitors to Hispania , heretic-hunting , as he had planned . In exchange , Martinus celebrated Communion with the bishops who had been active in the prosecution . So you see , civilization , tolerance , common decency won in the end . "  |p408A  glow awoke in Gratillonius . " By Hercules , " he exclaimed , " that Martinus is a soldier yet ! " At the back of his mind went the thought that this boded better for Ys , and for the hopes he cherished , than hitherto . " Be less pessimistic , " Ausonius urged . He gestured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broad , fertile , well-cultivated acres ; flourishingcities ; law and order , which reach into the very palace of the usurper . True , the Empire has its difficulties . But the life of the mind goes on , and that is what matters . That is what is eternal . " The mood of the younger man changed as he listened . He wanted to be away , immediately , back into action . He curbed himself . Best he abide a few days more , for his own sake as well as Bodilis 's , maybe also for the sake of Ys and Dahut . Let him gather what roses he could and bring them home . If ever he returned here , the flowerbeds might well lie trampledby the hoofs of warriors ' horses.  |p409Ever  was there something strange about Mumu , something apart from the rest of Eriu . To this southernmost of the Fifths , it was said , the Children of Danu withdrew after their defeat by the Children of Ir and Eber ; now their King dwelt within the Mountain of Fair Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave more sacrifices to Goddesses than to Gods , and believed that by mortal men certain of These had become ancestresses of their royal houses . Female druids , poets , and witches practicedtheir arts as often as did males , or oftener . Here above all it was terrible to be out after dark on the eves of Beltene and Samain , when the doors between the worlds stood open  --  so swarmed the dead and every other kind of uncanny being . Highlands walled Mumu off . Traffic did go back and forth , but less than elsewhere , and war with men of Condacht , Qbiget Lagini , or Mide seldom became more than a season of skirmishes . The Ulati were far in the north ; one scarcely even heard of them . The men of Mumu bore ample spears against each other . At the same time , safe harbors brought about overseas trade in a measure unknown to the neighbor realms . Romangoods arrived from as far as Aquitania : wine , oil , glass , earthenware , in exchange for gold , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ys . Scot 's Landing , below that city , took its name not from pirates out of Eriu but from the frequent , peaceful visits of Mumach fishers . The Christian faith got its first foothold on the island among their kinfolk , who claimed that some of the Lord 's own apostles had been there . Missionaries had not yet reached the rugged country about the Mountainof Fair Women when Lugthach maqq Aillelo was king over its allied tuaths . Afterward poets told how Fedelmm , daughter of Moethaire of thep410Corco Ochae , fought him . Not only did she have warriors at her beck , she was a mighty witch . The story went that she had a friend in the female warrior Bolce Ben-bretnach from Alba . Perhaps as a way to making peace , Bolce sought out Lugthach and laid upon him the demand that he bed her . He could not refuse one with her powers , and thus Conual maqq Lugthaci was begotten . At the birth , the father was away but Fedelmm was present , and to her the mother gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next night a coven was to meet in her house . Lest harm befall him , she hid Conual in a hole beneath the hearthstone . One of the witches sniffed him and said , " I do not destroy anything save what is under the cauldron . " At that , the fire flashed downwardand burned the ear of the boy . From this , some say , came his nickname Corcc , the Red ; but others say that was the color of his hair . He also became known as Conual maqq Larech , because his foster mother bore the nickname Lair Derg , the Red Mare . To her came a seer , who read the child 's hand and told him : " Always set free any captives you meet , if you are able . Do this , and your race will grow great and your fame endure . " Conual could scarcely have understood , then , but throughout his life he strove to obey the commandment . So went the stories . They did not say why Fedelmm soon gave the fostering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad to be free of the dark forces around herself . Torna was the foremost poet of his day , a man who saw deeply into things and knew promise when he found it . Already he wasiraising Niall maqq Echach , son of the King of Mide . He had rescued the child from the murderous spite of the King 's new wife , Mongfind , the witch-queen out of Mumu . Conual was only three or four years old when Torna deemed Niall of an age to return to Temir , show that he was not dead as everybody there believed , and claim his rights . Mongfind could wreak no further harm upon him . However , after his father died , she succeeded in having her brother Craumthan maqq Fidaci hailed King . A better person than his sister , on the whole he reigned well . His grief was that he was childless . When he heard about Conual , who was his cousin , he sent for the boy , meaning to make him an adoptive son . Torna let Conual go , counselling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon a worshipful friend of the older Niall and , when big enough , accompanied him to war . Fighting in Q6iget Lagini , they took a prisoner who proved to be a learned man . On that ground , Conual persuaded Niall he should be released without ransom.  |p411The  closeness between the princes aroused all of Mongfind 's malignancy . Niall was by then too strong , with too many handfast men , for her to seek his overthrow . It would take very little to break the uneasy peace and let him avenge the wrongs she had done him and his mother Carenn . But she could poison Craumthan 's mind against Conual , word by sly word . At last , sick of soul , the king decided he must be rid of the youth . He could not well have his fosterling slain at home . Instead , Mongfind whispered , he should entrust Conual with a message for a Pictish chieftainin Alba who was tributary to him . As a leavetaking gift , Craumthan gave Conual a shield whereon stood words engraved in ogamm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the North Channel and being wearied , he made camp on the beach . Who should chance by but the scholar he had set free ? Conual welcomed him , and presently fell asleep . The guest read what was on the shield , as the Pictish lord would also be able to do . The bearer was to be killed . The scholar changed the inscription . Hence , when Conual reached his destination , he was lavishly received , and soon got a daughter of the chieftain in marriage . Thus the story , and few men would be so rash as to gainsay a poet . Yet naked truth may be garbed in many different words . This tale might be a profound way of relating that Conual Corcc got in trouble at Temir and perforce departed with what small following he could muster , but won high standing in his exile . Of Niall , the poets told that he became King in Mide after Craumthan and Mongfind destroyed each other with an envenomed drink . Erelong he was warring abroad as well as in Eriu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with his wife among her people . He gathered men sworn to him and led them in battle through the great onslaught Niall masterminded and Magnus Maximus repelled . Afterward he brought them and their women down to the country of the Ordovices and Silures . A good many Scoti had settled there as Roman power ebbed out of the hills . Slowly that tide turned . Before leaving the Wall , Maximus had sent an ally , Cunedag of the Votadini , to take charge in that part of Britannia . Between him and the Second Legion , stationed at Isca Silurum , the Scoti found that they could no longer seize land as their numbers increased , but must fight to keep what they had . Conual Corcc became a leading war chieftain of theirs , who often raided deep into regions the Romans had supposed were safe . Loot made him wealthy . Yet he was , in his way , a thoughful man . Torna may have put that into him . Wherever he went , he looked keenly at things , and he turned thep412memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the farms , manors , towns , fortresses  --  the tools , machines , books , laws , the sense of a dominion and a history vaster than they could imagine in Eriu . Captives whom he let go spoke well of him upon returning home . In the course of time , truce and trade with Conual became just as possible as war . When he visited a Roman center , he asked endless questions ; and to Romans who ventured into his purlieu on peaceful business , he gave hospitality and protection . It was not that he had any wish to become a subject of their Empire . He understood too well what it was doing to itself . Besides , more and more he yearned for his homeland . But the riches and the knowledge he was gaining here would let him return in strength . It was noon when the legionaries again saw Ys . Sun and sky stood winterwan , but light gleamed off the few clouds and many wings aloft . Grass on the headlands was , as yet , sere above their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ran in amethyst , beryl , flint , silver . Its noise growled through a shrillness of wind , air alive with salt , kelp , and frost . And there between the steeps rose turreted ruddy walls , soaring and flashing towers . At high tide the sea gate was closed , surf battering under the battlements , and that too was utterly right , a part of coming home . The soldiers raised a cheer . Riding in front of them , Gratillonius signalledfor double time . Hobnails crashed on paving . Westbound along Aquilonian Way , the men saw ahead to the end of Cape ach , where the pharos loomed beyond clustered tombs . But soon their road swung north and downward , into the valley . Folk began to spy them and flock forth shouting from homes , farms , orchards nestled in the hills . Sentinels observedafar and sounded their trumpets . Aquilonian Way turned west again at the amphitheater , whose walls barred sight of the sacred grove . Thence the track ran straight between smithies , tanneries , carpenter shops , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until it entered High Gate . " The King , the King ! " Crowds jubilated . Gratillonius 's eyes stung . He swallowed hard . Did they truly love him like this ? He recognized an occasional face among those that swirled around , Herun the navy man , Maeloch the fisher , several marines who 'd been escorts of his or fighters against the Scoti , a wineseller for whom he had once gotten restitutionp413from a swindling wholesaler in Condate Redonum , a woman whom he had once given a judgment against an abusive husband , lesser Suffetesthemagnates would seek the palace for a more formal reception  --  " Companydismissed ! " he rapped . His men broke formation and flung themselves into the throng , searching for comrades and sweethearts . Gratillonius rode on . An impromptu guard formed , burly commoners who cleared his way for him , genially if not always gently . The press eased off as he turned from Lir Way into the crookedly rising streets along which the wealthy had their houses . Nobody was forbidden to go there , but most Ysans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity he had never encountered elsewhere . At the main entrance to the palace he dismounted , gave his horse over to the excited servants , and strode in his armor through the gardenwinter-bare , but trees and shrubs awhisper in the wind  --  to the modestsizedbuilding . Up its staircase he went , between the sculptured boar and bear , under the gilt eagle on the dome , the creatures of Taranis . Bronze doors , intricately figured , were flung wide for him , and he passed the entryroom and came into the atrium . There they stood , his Queens and their daughters  --  and Dahut , next to Quinipilis , 0 Mithras , how the child had grown , and how solemnly she stared from under a golden mane ! Also present were the men of the Council , attendants hovering in the background . He halted with a militarystamp and clang , raised his palm , intoned , " Greetings , my ladies and worthies , " while his heart thuttered and he forced his eyes to swing around , away from the girl who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Not yet . But what of the Gallicenae ? Bodilis smiled at him in unchanged serenity . Tears shimmered on the thin cheeks of Innilis , who huddled close to expressionlessly saluting Vindilis . Lanarvilis 's ceremonial gesture showed more warmth . Maldunilis squealed in delight ; she was very pregnant . The gaze of Forsquilis smoldered out of her Athene countenance above the infant she bore , whose age must be about two months . How Quinipilis had grown old , the hands trembling that clutched the staff on which she leaned , flesh dried away from the knotted , painful bones , though her grin crinkled wicked as ever . Fennalis too seemed less plump than erstwhile , like an apple that has begun to wither . Guilvilis stood timidly to the rear , her own newest babe clutched to her bosom , her older daughter by Gratillonius clinging to her skirt . Three stepped forward and confronted him : Soren Cartagi , Speaker for Taranis ; Hannon Baltisi , Lir Captain ; Forsquilis , whom the Nine serving Belisama must have chosen to be their voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ys , your city , " they said together . " May you henceforthlong abide in our midst . " " I thank you , " said Gratillonius out of an unreasonably dry throat . Seeking to lighten the atmosphere : " And I so intend . You seem well prepared for my arrival . " Forsquilis nodded . Her glance caught his . He nodded back . On the previous three nights , when his band made camp for lack of other accommodation , a great owl had ghosted by . " How have you and the city fared ? " he asked . Soren shrugged . " There 's little to tell , save that  --  No matter now , no large matter at all . " " What mean you ? " Gratillonius demanded . " Ah , we 'd not spoil this hour , " Hannon said . He was seldom that cordial . " It can wait . You 're the one with the real news , whatever it be . " " News indeed , " Gratillonius drew breath . " Too much for telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll agree my journey 's borne fruit we had need of , knowledge , though some of it be bitter on the tongue . Bodilis , I did visit Ausonius . " She grew radiant . " As for the rest of what I have to convey , it will require much time and thought of us . Best we wait until tomorrow or the day after . " Soren opened his mouth as if to protest , but Forsquilis cut him oil . " We understand , " she said . " With no immediate danger , ' t would be foolish to rush into complexities . Come , let 's proceed to the banquet we 've prepared for our King . " When the others departed after the festivities , she stayed . In his secret self , Gratillonius had hoped for that . After celibate months , the Bull ramped through his blood . A phantom went there as well , memory of failure in Treverorum , fear of new punishment for his sin . Forsquilis was both the most passionate and the most artful of the Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of extravagant admiration , bent over the cradle of little Nemeta . ( After all , he had been unable to keep from hugging Dahut . ) The mother ended that herself , pouncing and clutching , purring and mewing . They well-nigh ripped the clothes off each other . Her beauty flamed atp415him . He never knew whether he cast her down or she pulled him down . He entered her with a roar , and her hips surged beneath him like the sea . After the second time they were satisfied to lie talking while strength regathered itself . He half sat , propped on pillows against the headboard that was usual on Ysan beds . She lay curled in the curve of his left arm , her hair spilling amber-brown across his chest . The odor of her was warm and wild . " Ah , " she crooned , " I 've missed you , Grallon . " " And I you . " His free hand strayed over her breasts . Milkful , they jutted proudly from her slenderness . How golden the light was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " she answered , " especially after  --  " The words turned into a laugh . Appalled , he felt her fingers on his lips . " Nay , we need speak naught of that . Stallions will be stallions , for which I thank our Lady of the Lovetime . " " Is there aught you do n't know , you witch ? " he gusted in his relief . She sobered . " Much . The politics of men and their God  --  " Her look sought a shuttered window . . . the night wind beyond ? " You have returneda sadder man than you went , my darling . Why ? " Strangely , it was not strange to blurt to this cat-female , as if she were a man or wise Bodilis : " Maximus , Emperor Maximus , I misjudged him . He lives not for Rome but for power , and for power not only over bodies but souls . " From him stumbled the story of what he had seen and endured . Forsquilisheld him close . " So you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are , your whole Sisterhood . He means to destroy what he calls witchcraft , rip it out by the roots and cast it on the fire . " " And you 're to do his weeding for him , eh ? " she said low , again lookingelsewhere . " I wo n't . I am the King of Ys , as . . . I finally , truly discovered on this faring . . . . But I can not rise against Rome ! " he yelled . That roused Nemeta , who began to cry . Forsquilis flowed from the bed , took up the babe , soothed and nursed her , the eidolon of young motherhood , while she asked coolly , " What then do you propose to do ? " " I know not . " Gratillonius smote fist into palm . " I 've thought and thought . I suppose we have two or three years ' grace . Maximus must secure his frontier along the Rhenus and make a lasting settlement with Valentinianus  --  aye , still more with Theodosius in Constantinople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling down at her child , " much can happen . "  |p416He  nodded violently . " ' T is my hope . Already Ys is central to the defense of Armorica . If we can weave such a net of alliances that we are vital , with so many powerful friends in the Empire that he must keep his hands off us  --  " " I was thinking of what might happen to Magnus Maximus , " she said . A shiver went through him . Forsquilis straightened and gave him a level regard . Her tone turned brisk . " Well , these things can await the morrow . We 've a third celebration to carry out , I trust , you and I. It should be soon , for you 'll need a good night 's sleep . " Her words roused fresh lust and gladness . " Oh , we can lie abed late . " She shook her head . " Nay , that would not be meet . You must be up betimes , 0 King . Too long has your duty been undone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no large task . ' T is only that postponing it further would dishonor Taranis . " The Queen frowned . " Hm , I 'd forgotten , we never told you . Well , soon after you departed , a challenger arrived at the Wood . We 've perforce housed him there , fed him , supplied him with harlots and amusementsand whatever else befits one who might become King , these past months . High time to end the farce . " Gratillonius sat upright . His muscles tautened . " A fight to the death ? " Forsquilis laughed anew . " Nay , merely a chore , albeit a sacral one . This is a pitiful shrimp of an Osismian . Clear ' t is , he heard the King would be long away , and knew what a challenger is entitled to , and came to take advantage , with the intent of sneaking off ere you returned . But I divined as much and warned Soren , who ordered a surreptitious watch kept on him . When news of your advent blossomed today , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning you 'll kill him , and there 's an end of the business , aside from the rites that follow . " She tenderly laid her babe , now drowsy , back in the cradle ; turned about ; glided toward the bed , arms wide . " I believe you are ready now . " she whispered . " Come , let 's make love . A long , long love . " Rain blew up during the night . By dawn its chill drizzle engulfed sky , sea , hills . At the Wood of the King , it dripped off bare oak branches and runneled down trunks and made soggy last year 's leaves on the earth . Thep417blood-colored house at the border of the grove was dulled , as if the blood were starting to clot . There waited Soren in his sacerdotal robes , together with six marines , their horses and hounds . They were the guards over Hornach , who had dared strike the Hammer to the brazen Shield that hung in the yard outside . His centurion 's battle gear moved easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portico . Grotesque idol-shaped columns grinned at him . Underneath the roof lay shadowiness through which he peered at his opponent . Hornach was not quite the weakling of Forsquilis 's comtempt , but he was scrawny ; the mail into which they had stuffed him draped limp over knocking knees , the helmet threatened to slide down his nose . Even in this cold , his fear stank . " Hail ! " boomed from the seven men and the household staff to the King . Hornach reached out . " Oh , please , " he croaked , " please , I 've made a horrible mistake , I 'll surrender , abase myself , do anything  --  " " Shall we accompany you , sir ? " asked a marine . " Would n't do to make you chase him . Heh ! " he snickered . " Nay , that were unseemly . ' T is never been done thus , " Soren declared . " We 'll put a leash around his waist for you to hold , my lord . " A snarl : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood to die as Taranis wills . " " I have an old mother , sir , I 've been sending her coins from here , she 'll starve without me , " blubbered the Osismian . A trouser leg darkened and clung to the shin ; he was dribbling piss . Gratillonius had expected a straightforward fight against somebody like a Bacauda  --  had deceived himself into expecting it , he suddenly understood . His gullet thickened . " This is no combat , ' t is butchery , " he got out . " Unworthy of the God . I accept his surrender . " Hornach went on his knees , weeping , and scrabbled to hug the King 's . His guards yanked him back . " That may not be , lord , " said Soren , shock clear to see beneath his implacability . " This creature issued the challenge . Worse , he did so in falsehood . Strike him down , in the name of the God . " Gratillonius remembered Priscillianus . But he was the King of Ys , and here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " he said , " let it at least be quick . " After praying to Taranis , they hitched a cord around the waist of Hornach . Gratillonius led him on his wabbling way through the brush , until they stood alone in a glade . Rain mumbled in the trees around , washed away tears , sought past armor . Dead leaves squashed underfoot.  |p418Gratillonius  undid the leash , stepped back , drew sword and brought up shield . " Make ready , " he said . Hornach shuddered , once . His blade jerked forth . It was of the long Germanic sort , and either he had refused a shield  --  unlikely  --  or no one had thought to offer him it , or he in his terror to voice the request . " Have at me , " Gratillonius invited . Do ! screamed within him . " You might win , you know . You might become the next King of Ys . " He gagged on his lie . " Let me go , " Hornach pleaded . " I meant no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Gods will love you . " Not the Gods of Ys , Gratillonius thought . In a moment 's confusion : But I in my heart give Them no honor any longer . Why should I do this thing ? Iron answered : Because I will destroy myself , my Kingship , everything that is left me to care about , if I openly flout Their will . Hornach wailed and half turned to run . Get it over with ! thought Gratillonius , and advanced . His opponent twisted around , raised sword , chopped wildly . Gratillonius caught the feeble blow on his shield . The other throat was open to him . He smote . The trouble then was that Hornach did not die . He flopped on the ground , spouting blood and screams . When Gratillonius bent down to give a mercy stroke , hands tried to wave it off . Abruptly Gratillonius must vomit . When he had finished , Hornach lay still . Gratillonius stood in the rain , plunging his blade into the earth , over and over , to cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have hadto tell makes me wonder if Ys may not hold the world 's highest civiliza-tion . " I am no knacker ! he cried into the nothingness and the cold . I am a soldier . Threefold Gods Who robbed the world of Dahilis , will You not send me honest enemies ? If You make sport of me , why should I pour out blood for You ? Taranis , Lir , Belisama , be warned . I am calling on Mithrasto come end Your day , Mithras , Lord of Light.  |p419U|p  from the South wandered spring , and as she breathed upon naked boughs and wet earth there leaped forth blossoms , leaves , new grass , tender herbs , across the length of Armorica . Sunbeams and cloud shadowspursued each other , with rainsqualls and rainbows , till the wind lay down to rest and whiteness brooded huge in the blue . Lambs , calves , foals explored meadows , amazed by brilliance . Wives reopened their homes to air while they scrubbed away winter 's grime ; farmers hitched ox to plow , mariners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the house of Queen Vindilis , unless it be a certain bleak freshness . When Fennalis arrived , she gave her brief greeting and led her straight through the austerely ornamented atrium to the privateroom . Refreshments did wait on its table , nothing more than wine , bread , cheese , and , to be sure , oysters in their opened shells . Having closed the door , the women made reverence before the image that occupied a niche , Belisama in Her aspect of the Wild Huntress . " Be seated , " said Vindilis then . " Avail yourself . How fare you ? " " Oh , you know my rheumatism plagues me in changeable weather , and we get so many bad colds among people at this season that I 've scarce had time to think . " Fennalis was much in demand as a healer , second only to Innilis . She lacked the Touch that sometimes came to the latter , but she had the sympathy , together with more practical skill . She lowered her dumpy form to the couch , reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 've not asked me here to put polite questions . " Humor died away as she looked up at the one who stood over her . As usual , Vindilis was plainly clad for a person of rank in Ys : today a gown of pearl-hued wool bordered with a procession in blue of the Goddess 's cats and doves , a massive garnet brooch at her throat . Hair drawn back inp420tight , coiled braids made doubly vivid the white streak through its blacknessand emphasized the aquilinity of her features . In the greenish light from the window , her eyes seemed enormous , full of night . " I thank you for coming , " she said , with no softening of her tone . " I believe you 'll agree ' t is on a matter of moment . " Fennalis 's pugnosed countenance registered puzzlement . She ran fingersthrough the snowy mane that bristled out of the pins and comb wherewith she sought to control it . " Why me ? I 'm not wise or strong or , or anything . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try . " " I am with child , " Vindilis told her . Fennalis half rose , slopping wine from cup . " What ? Why , wonderful ! " " That remains to be seen . Yesterday Innilis examined me and confirmedwhat the signs had said . The birth should come about winter solstice . " Fennalis sank back and was quiet a while before replying low , " Why are you troubled ? ' T was your choice to leave off using the Herb . Aye , you 're not youthful , but you 've kept yourself as fit as a lynx . Fear not . " Vindilis snapped forth a laugh . " Does the smith who is forging a sword fear it will cut him down ? Nay , what frets him is that it may prove weak in the wielder 's hand . " " What mean you ? " Fennalis asked , not quite steadily . Vindilis began pacing , to and fro before the couch . Her skirts whispered . She stared before her as she said : " I confide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you are neither weak nor foolish , Fennalis , underneath those flustery ways of yours . Six children have you borne to three different Kings , and all are still alive . Under Colconor , you could have drawn yourself into the background  --  he had little yen for you  --  but instead you stood up to him , again and again , took his abuse , fended the worst of his cruelties off Dahilis as well as your own daughters . And in the end , if you were not the first , neither were you the last who dared call on us to curse him . Since then  --  " Fennalis waved her hands . " I am not hostile to King Grallon . " Vindilis laughed anew . " Nor intimate of his , either . You made no secret of your displeasure when he would not truly take you for his wife , and in Council you 've opposed more than one proposal of his . " Fennalis sighed . " That 's past . He 's true to his faith , and so meant me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly gone away . I am content . " " Are you ? " Vindilis swung about and stood confronting her . " The rest are , more or less , aye . Think them over . Bodilis is his favorite , his . . .  |p421his  friend . Lanarvilis has her disagreements with him , but not very often any more . To her , he is Rome , the Roman virtue and the Roman peace she imagines once existed . Quinipilis surely has her doubts , but she enjoys his company and is , anyhow , too old and weary for dispute . To Maldunilis , he has a big cock and is kindly . Guilvilis is his adoring brood mare . Forsquilis  --  who can ever tell what Forsquilis thinks ? I dare not yet be frank with her . That leaves you . " " And Innilis . " " Innilis . . . will follow my lead . " Suddenly the voice of Vindilis had a lullaby sound . " But what shall it be ? She also looks on him as a good man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lady forbidthat I ever put Innilis in danger or distress . " She signed herself . " If you are embittered , why are you bearing his child ? " Fennalis asked as softly . Vindilis smiled slightly . " I am not aggrieved . He slew horrible Colconor . He does his best for Ys and for his Queens , and his best is generally excellent . " She drew breath . " ' T is not his fault that Innilis and I can snatch only stolen , secret moments . ' T is not his fault , even , that that aborted get of his almost killed her . Nay , we could be far worse off . I doubt we could be better off . " " But still you oppose him . " " Because he is what he is ! " Vindilis cried . " I 've not come lightly to this . I 've watched , questioned , listened , pondered . I 've prayed to the Mother of Stars for guidance . No clear answer came to me , but  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-foam and heard in the sea-wind , all seemed to call me forward . " Fennalis occupied herself as prosaically as might be with slicing the cheese . " At last you decided to have his child , " she said . Vindilis nodded . " What other hold on him can be mine ? " She went to the window and stood staring into it , as if able to see clearly through the small , leaded panes , out beyond the city and across Ocean . " ' T was no easy decision , " she said to the woman at her back . " A wish for this was never vouchsafed me . In my vestalhood I meant to renew my vows and become a minor , virgin priestess . What hopes I cherishedran toward things like founding a gymnasium for girls . Understand , Fennalis , I do not hate the minds or the deeds of men . ' T is their sweaty , hairy bodies that repel me  --  that , and their supposition that because of what 's between my legs , I should forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom that most Ysan women enjoyed . " I remember , " she said . " The Sign came upon you and  --  You were lucky that Hoel was King then . He too was decent . "  | " Just the same  --  did you know ?  --  ' t was Quinipilis , my mother , who forced me to open my womb to him . Forced me , I say , by endless argumentsand browbeatings and  --  " Vindilis shrugged , grinned . " She was a formidable character in her day , she was . At last I gave in and produced the grandchild she wanted . One . You know well I never paid Runa more heed than I absolutely must . Poor little brat . I hope I 'm shrewder these days , more in control of myself . " There was a silence , apart from a whoo-oo of springtime wind under the eaves . " Why do you tell me this ? " Femialis asked at length . Vindilis turned about . " Is it not clear ? I want your counsel , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older woman put aside the food with which she had toyed and took up her wine instead . It was more fitting . " You want influence on Grallon beyond your mere persuasions . " " Aye . I need it . We all do . " Vindilis resumed her caged pacing . " Think , " she said . " Because he has done so well , authority flows more and more to him . Now he 's put the final seal on his Kingship , his halidom , by slaying a challenger in the Wood . That wipes out , from the minds of the people , any last fear that he may not yet have settled his account with the Gods . And he 's young , strong , skilled . Surely he 'll make short work of any future contestants . " But he is a Roman ! p " What about this new Emperor Maximus , who sent him to us ? " " Grallon explained he wo n't let Maximus in , " Fennalis ventured . " So he says . Belike he means it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanswithout the help of our Gods ? And in spite of the outcome of that fight , I do not believe he is friends with Them . Why , he intends building a temple to his Bullslayer . What will Taranis feel when His priest and avatar bows down to Mithras ? " " That may  --  I know not  --  " Vindilis pressed on , like a hunted toward wounded quarry : " Also , what may happen , what will he do , when next the Sign descends ? Have you never lain awake wondering , you whom he refused because Lanarvilis is your daughter ? Quinipilis has few years left her  --  mayhap only hours . Which of the vestals will the Gods then choose ? " " It could be any . " " Are you so hopeful ? " Vindilis compressed her lips . " Myself , I doubt They will make the matter easy for him . I think They will give him a daughter of one of us . And not your Amair . Not when They have Lanarvilis 's Miraine and Boia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be of marriageable age ; and not long after that , Bodilis 's Semuramat or my Runa . The Gods have Their sport with us , do n't They , Fennalis ? You 're old too , after all . Or any of us could die unexpectedly . What then ? " I say to you , whatever peace is between Grallon and the Gods is as uneasy as peace between Rome and Ys ; and it will erelong be put to the test . We Gallicenae must make ready for that , as best we are able . ThereforeI am bearing the King a child . A lure , a hostage , a talisman ? I know not . Help me , my Sister . " The energy seemed to go from Vindilis . She lowered herself to a chair opposite the couch , lifted a wine cup , drank , and stared into emptiness . " I see , " Fennalis breathed . " Yours is a noble soul . " " Nay , " Vindilis mumbled . " Only one that would fain stay free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , you 're right . We must seek to steer the King away from what he might otherwise do . I mean all the Nine , once you and I have found the ways to explain this to them . And , yea , motherhood does confer power , if used wisely . " Vindilis nodded . " As small a touch as proposing a name . " " What ? " Fennalis asked . She considered , and nodded in her turn . " Aye . Though ' t was he who wanted the three Roman tags we have . " " Our Sisters were clever enough not to speak against it . " What they thought of were not Maldunilis 's Zisa , Guilvilis 's Sasai , or Forsquilis 's Nemeta . The custom was that the first-born of a Queen should carry her mother 's vestal name onward . But Guilvilis now had Antonia , called after a sister of Gratillonius afar in Britannia ; and Lanarvilis had borne Julia , honoring his mother ; and Bodilis had Una , though whom that commemorated had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion , " Vindilis said . " What is it ? " " Augustina . From the legion that was his . " In the two years following his disaster at Ys , Niall maqq Echach waged war over and over in his own land of Mide . Tuaths that thought him weakened , or in disfavor with the Gods , would refuse him his due , and take arms when he fared to demand it . The first several such battles were desperate , for he had indeed suffered heavy loss , the finest of his warriors . Yet he blazed his way through , won victory , made stern terms of peace ,  |p424brought  heads and hostages back to Temir . As word got around , rebelliousnessslacked off , while a new crop of young men began dreaming of glory and booty to be gained in the host of this lord . It was Endae Qennsalach , King over the Lagini , who had egged on much of this revolt . Bad blood was ancient between his folk and Niall 's . Some three hundred years before , Tothual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it out of Laginach territory . Nevertheless , the King of the latter wedded a daughter of Tothual  --  but , wearying of her , confined her in a secret place , gave out that she was dead , and got her sister 's hand . When the second wife chanced to discover the first , both died of the shame this incest had put on them . Tothual thereupon raged through Q6iget Lagini , slaying , plundering , burning , till he got abject surrender . His price was the paying , every second year , of that tribute which came to be called the Boruma . So vast was this sum of cows , pigs , cloaks , bronzeware , and silver that it would have beggared the Lagini . Hence the time was not long until they refused . Since then , those Condachtach and Mide Kings who had the claim seldom got it satisfied , and only by collecting it at sword 's point after a bitter war . Thus did hatred build up over many lifetimes . Endae , always a maker of trouble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring ruin on his enemy . In the third summer , Niall came looking for revenge . The armies met south of the River Ruirthech . That was a dly when clouds blew like smoke , low above the valley , underneath a sky the hue of lead . Rainshowers rushed out of them , drenched men , washed their wounds and their dead , passed away on the keening wind . All colors were dulled except those of blood and gold . Shouts , horn calls , hoofbeats , footfalls , clamorous wheels , clash and rattle of weapons , were somehow muffled . But blows fell as heavy and sharp as always . Niall 's chariot boomed ahead . Grass was thick but slippery beneath its iron-shod fellies ; it took all the skill Cathual the driver owned to keep onward full tilt . Behind him the King stood cat-balanced against the rocking and jouncing . Niall roared , stabbed with his spear , smote with his blade , lifted their reddened points on high for a sign to his followers . He himself was a banner , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beard fell primrose-yellow from the helmet , seven-colored cloak fluttered back from the wide shoulders , gold and amber shone upon the saffron tunic . The handsomeness of his face was twisted into battle fury , wherein eyes glinted lightning-blue , teeth bone-white . Hounds ran alongside , to leap , bay , slash , tear , howl . He seemed as much beast as they , as much war-god as Lug come to earth . Many a brave man saw what approachedp425and fled , casting his arms from him , wailing the same blind panic into his comrades . Withal , Niall remained a leader , a part of him watchful and aware . He kept track of the other chariots in his van , right and left . Nearest was that of Domnuald , son by the second of his Queens . This was the lad 's first combat , he no more than fifteen summers of age . Hard practice rewarded itself ; Domnuald poised easily and struck keenly . Hair like his father 's hung wet down cheeks still girlish . 0 Brigit , Mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niall 's arms outside the wall of Ys ! Older sons drove in the wings , themselves already blooded men , restlessas stallions , toplofty as eagles . Several nobles had chariots too . More chose to come behind afoot , leading their tenants , with swords , spears , axes , bills , slings , while bows twanged and arrows hissed . The din cut through wind and rain , on up to the hasty clouds . There cruised scaldcrowsand ravens , birds of the MOrrigu , gathering at Her feast . Before Niall , and soon around him , the Lagini fought back . They were equipped and marshalled like his men , and maybe numbered the same . Most of them battled wolfishly well . But they could not make headway . They could not even hold fast . Day had not much dwindled when they were all fled , or captive , or sprawled and emptily staring corpses . Endae sent a herald to ask for truce . Niall received him as was fitting for one whose person was sacred , and sent him back with word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battleground , a house of the king of the tuath that lived thereabouts . While they waited , Niall and his chieftains took it over and made merry . Dark as the afternoon was , they burned lamps and links without stint . Breaths smoked white athwart shadows crouching , dancing , changing shape , filling every corner and the smoky spaces under the roof . Highlights gleamed , an eye , a smile , a lifted beaker . This was no mead hall , with benches along the walls and a flock of servants . The highest ranking men sat on stools , the rest on the clay floor , and drink passed from hand to hand . Nonetheless , merriment rang . " Have you a song for us , Laidchenn , dear ? " Niall called . " I have that , " answered the poet . As was the custom , he had accompaniedthe army to watch what happened and afterward put it in words . That was as honorable as to fight , or more so ; for what was the use ofp426mighty deeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them travel afar ? " But I ask leave to wait a while . " " How is this ? " wondered Niall . The buzz of talk died away until rain sounded loud on the thatch overhead . Laidchenn gestured . He was a burly man with fiery , bushy hair and beard , carelessly dressed , but a man to command awe  --  chief singer to the King , former pupil of Torna Eces in Mumu . " You know that I , like you , have brought a young son of mine along for the experiencing of his first war , though Domnuald is to become a valiant fighter whereas Tigernach is studying my art under myself . Would you be so kind as to hear the lad 's piece ? A maiden effort , but burning within him it is , and I think not unworthy of you . " " He is very welcome , " said Niall graciously . Tigernach stood up . He was about the same age as Domnuald , and growing toward his father 's body form . Brown-haired , his countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzz of whiskers . He did not shake a chiming rod , for he was , after all , a novice in the craft . Yet melody rippled clear and true from his harp , and boldness  --  brashness , almost  --  rose in his tones . " Lord who harried Lagini , Star-brilliant in the battle  --  " His verse lacked subtlety , the tropes were sparse , and older men winced a bit at its fulsomeness . However , it was properly composed and showed high promise , as spirited as it was . Niall thanked him and gavel him a silver brooch . Tigernach blushed so it could be seen in the dimness , mumbledhis own thanks , and sat down . Laidchenn glowed with pride . Of course , there was no comparison to the father 's words . They soared , they cried , they sent ghosts shivering up and down backbones . Tears rolled over leathery visages , fists clenched , eyes stared outward beyond the world , as Laidchenn wove his magic . Meanwhile King Endae drove up with a dozen well-born attendants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward given . A youth at Endae 's side protested . " Hush , " said the King . " This is meet and right . Never show disrespect to a druid or an ollam poet . That is a gess upon all men . " He stared glumly into the gloomy day . Rain and mist made vague the encampment of the invaders , though he heard their boisterousness loudly enough . Closer by , servants of the dispossessed labored at the cookhouse to prepare a magnificent meal , or at the pens to feed cattle that would doubtless be herded away . At last the guards let the newcomers in . When E ' ndae 's champion an/nounced him , and the Laginach King himself entered , Niall did not rise , nor even lift a knee . However , he did in seemly words offer a few seats he had reserved , and call for full cups that the guests be refreshed . Attendantsbore off their overgarments and brought dry cloaks for them to wrap themselves in against the chill . " Well , " said Niall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall there not ? " " That we must see , " answered Endae . He was a lean man , gray of hair and beard . " Let us begin by knowing each the other , " Niall said , and beckoned Laidchenn to name the Mide men on hand , with their honors . " No such show have I this mournful day , " Endae said , " but myself I will tell you who accompanies me . " He gestured . " Here are my sons  --  " He came to one about the same age as Domnuald and Tigernach , also clearly a war-virgin until now : slim , comely , intensely black of hair , white of skin , blue of eye . " Eochaid , youngest who has followed me ; but younger still are brothers he has at home , and they growing . " " Why , that is the name my father bore , " Niall said with a smile . " Well met , Eochaid , I hope . " He got back a glower . Cruel it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Endae hastened on with the introductions . " Now , then , " he concluded , " the Gods this day have seen fit to grant you the victory , Niall maqq Echach ; but you will be acknowledging that it was dearly bought , and the valor of the Lagini abides . What offer do you make us , that we swear peace with you ? " Niall tossed back his bright locks . " No offer , Endae Qennsalach . Why should I pay for that which I have won ? Henceforward you shall keep your spoon out of my stewpot ; and , obedient at last to oaths given long ago , you shall deliver the Bbruma . " Breath hissed between teeth , but men sat still , not altogether surprised  --  save young Eochaid , who leaped to his feet and howled , " What , would you gnaw us bare , you maggots ? Never ! " His voice cracked across , which enraged him the more . " We 'll pull you from our flesh and stamp you flat ! " " Quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son 's sleeve . " You disobey . " Eochaid was unaware . " Maggots , blowflies , beetles you are ! " he raved . " Wait , only wait , and we 'll seek your nests and smoke you out ! " Laidchenn surged erect . The bulk of him loomed huge in the flickering gloom , a touch of flame in his beard . He rang his poet 's chimes . Men shrank into silence . " Have a care , boy , " he warned . " Overwrought or no ,  |p428you  slander honorable foes , like some mad crone in a ditch . Behave your-self . " Eochaid wept . His arms flailed . " Crone , am I ? Go back to your sheepfold , old ewe , and let the rams tup you again ! " Horror ran around the room . Before anyone else could rally the wit to speak , Laidchenn 's son Tigernach was up also . In him , fury was a winter storm . " You fling filth like that at my father , at a poet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " He made a twin spike of the first two fingers on his left hand and thrust it toward Eochaid . As if something inside him had foreseen , brooded , prepared , the verses snarled from him : " Listen , you light-witted youth ! For that you thus dared speaking Words unwise and without truth , We shall soon hear you shrieking . " Bellowing your bluster out As if you 'd gnawed a nettle , You 'd be shrewder not to shout But kick an empty kettle . " Shame there shall be on your face . It is of your own earning . Curs will cringe when in disgrace . May likewise you be learning ! " Eochaid screamed , stumbled backward , fell to his knees , clutched at his head . On cheeks and brow three great blisters were springing forth , blood-red , sleet-white , mould-black . He groaned in his pain . Toward sundown the rains blew over and the wind lay down to rest . Laidchenn and his son walked from the house , away from others who likewise came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deepening blue . Light , pouring level through the valley , reached to a rainbow . Grass drank those rays and gave them back in glitter and green glow . They made treetops smolder , water glimmer . The air was cold and quiet , save as shoes scuffed and slithered over wet/ness or voices came faint across distance . Most of those cries were sounded by carrion birds , scared into darkling clouds by men who searched the battlefield for kin and comrade . " You should not have done it , " said Laidchenn softly . " I did not reproachyou then , for that would further have undermined King Niall ; but now I tell you , a satire is a weapon more fearsome than knife or poison . " Stubbornness made Tigernach thrust out his lower lip , though it quivered . " How did it harm our King , if one who behaved thus in his presence suffered punishment ? " Laidchenn sighed . " It was too harsh for a grieving , bewildered boy . His insults diminished none but himself . Surely his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance to do . Now  --  The blisters will heal . They may or may not leave disfiguring scars . But the wound in the soul will fester for aye . Niall saw this  --  I could tell  --  and softened his demands . Else the damaged , unappeased honor of the Lagini would have forced them into war to the death . After Ys he can , as yet , ill afford that . You have cost him dearly , my son . " Tigernach 's will broke . He shuddered , covered his eyes , wavered on his feet . " If the King wants my head for that , " he choked , " here it is . " " Not so . " Laidchenn squeezed the shoulder beside him , and kept his hand on it as the two walked along . " We understand each other , himself and I. His feelings were clear to me from his glances my way and the words he used . Folk should certainly avenge injuries done their darlings . He is not angry because of your anger on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he did win the day ; he did exact good terms ; the Bbruma was really too much to hope for , unless in some later year . " Still Tigernach sorrowed . " Indeed , my heart , " Laidchenn went on after a moment , " none was more surprised than me at what happened . Who would have thought that you , as far as you are from being an ollam poet , that you could already cast a destructive satire ? Did a God seize you , or do you have it in you to become at last as powerful as Torna ? Whichever , clear is to see that you have been marked for a fate that will touch many lives . " Tigernach drew an uneven breath and straightened . Laidchenn gazed toward the river . Mysterious flittings and rustlings went through the reeds along the bank . " Beware , " he said . " Henceforwardbe always careful , and never use your art but on those occasions when you feel sure you must . This day you have made us an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Your fate will be famous , but perhaps it will not be happy . "  |p430At  high summer , the rain sometimes fell nearly warm through unmoving air . It was heavy upon the day when Queen Lanarvilis received Lir Captainand the Speaker for Taranis . Sight quickly lost itself in that ironcoloredcataract ; it found no more sky , no more sea , only dim walls along streets where water rushed and gurgled . What filled the world was the noise of the downpour on roofs and paving , and below this , remote and eternal , waves a-crash against the rampart of Ys . The men gave their hooded cloaks over to the servant who admitted them and proceeded directly to the room where the priestess waited . For them , its numerous candles did not truly fend off gloom , nor its **34;14632;TOOLONG offer comfort . She had attired herself in a loosely cut dress of white silk whose folds and drapes joined with a silver headband to make a timeless dignity . The visitors were in plain civil tunic , trousers , half-boots . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to draw notice on their way here . " Welcome , " she said , touching her breast in the salutation between equals . The gaze of Soren Cartagi followed that hand . " Be seated , pray . I 've naught set out but wine and water , for your message asked I receive you on grave business . Gladly , though , will I call for better fare , and afterward have you be my guests at supper . " Taking the couch that faced her chair , Hannon Baltisi shook his craggy head . " I thank you , my lady , but best we not linger , the Speaker and me , " he said . " Folk might wonder why , and this needs to be secret . " Soren joined his companion . For a moment , play of light tricked the eye , and Soren 's hair and beard seemed as gray as Hannon 's . As he settled down , they regained their darkness around his broad , beak-nosed visage . It was just the scattered white in them , more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgetting that a third party was present , until she said slowly : " This concerns the King , does it not ? " " Who else ? " Soren growled . Her voice wavered a little . " What 's wrong ? I read trouble , anger on you , but but he 's done naught that he should n't . " Flushing , compelling herself to look steadily into the faces , both the faces : " It happens he spent last night with me . After three years wedded to him , I 'd have known if aught was awry . Did it touch the city , he 'd have told me . " " What had he to say , then ? " Soren asked impulsively . The color mounted in her cheeks . " No affair of anyone else ! " She regained self-possession ; she had had much practice at that . " Oh , mainly small talk . We played a while with Julia , and he babbled about the latest wonderful thing Dahut has accomplished , and we went on to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain the same that he set forth at the Solstice Council . " Hannon nodded . Tension gathered in his lank frame . At that meeting he had led the opposition to the King 's proposal to make yet another circuit about western Armorica and down to Portus Namnetum , weaving tighter his web of alliances . Gratillonius had been far too much away , neglecting his sacral duties to the point of contumely before the Gods . In the end , a compromise had been reached . Gratillonius would go , but not until after the equinox , and he pledged himself to have returned by winter solstice . Before Hannon could speak , Soren did : " I beg my lady 's pardon . No intrusion  --  no discourtesy intended . The more so when we are here to seek your counsel and help . " Lanarvilis leaned back in her chair and let her hands lie quietly crossed on her lap . " Say on . " " T is this , this temple of his foreign God Mithras he means to build . " Soren choked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Reluctantly by a number of Suffetes , aye . But when we , the Gallicenae , having searched our hearts , our books , and our dreams , could find naught forbidding it , as long as he stays dutiful toward the Gods of Ys  --  " " How long will that be ? At the combat in the Wood  --  " Soren curbed himself . " No matter that . ' T is Lir Captain who bears the word today . I simply came along to give my support , my own plea for yours . You and I have worked together often over the years , Lanarvilis . " He hunched where he sat . The older man 's voice rolled forth as if once again he trod the deck of a ship . His look commanded , too.  | " Forgive me if I 'm curt , my lady . You know ' t is my way . " Ill did Grallon 's wish strike me . Bad enough having a Christian priest mewling amongst us again . The King ca n't help that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ull pay any heed . But this Mithras , now  --  well , in my seafaring days I learned somewhat about Mithras . Mind you , he 's no bad God like you Christ . He stands for uprightness , manliness , and He 'll let other Gods abide . But He is the Bullslayer , the Comrade of the Sun . He sets Himself above the rest and lays a law of His own on His worshippers . Remember how Grallon must needs refuse the crown after he won Kingship . Not a great thing in itself , maybe , but a sign of . . . what else ' ? " In storm , in fog , in dead calm and sea-blink through endless silences : I have known the Dread of Lir , my lady . Ys lives on His sufferance . No disrespect to Belisama or Taranis , nay , nay . We live by Them too . But the Pact of Brennilis made Ys forever hostage to Lir , did it nay ? " Quietness deepened until the rainfall sounded torrential . Lanarvilis nodded and signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears no human face , " Hannon said . After a heartbeat , he went on : " Well , Grallon aims to take a warehouse down by the harbor , unused since trade went to hell ere we were born , he 'll take that and make it into a temple of Mithras . You remember this was after the Council would n't let him buy land and dig a cave out in the hinterland . " They could barely hear Lanarvilis : " The earth is Belisama 's . And Mithraswill have no women devotees . " " Taranis makes fruitful the earth , " rumbled from Soren . " Therefore Grallon needs a house in town , " Hannon said . " Now that arrangement seemed to me just as wrong . What gave it Lir for Ibis honor , Lir Who 's so quick to wrath ? " He paused , filled his lungs , stared past the Queen . " Well , " he said , " people do n't pray to Lir , you know . We sacrifice , we obey , but He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His sea is already salt enough . " And yet  --  well , sometimes He does make His will known , ' stead of whelming those who go against it . He did for Brennilis , long ago . If now we 're at the end of the Age she birthed , might He again ? I went forth by myself , in a boat , beyond sight of land . I fasted , I thirsted , I held myself sleepless , till  --  " He surged to his feet . " Nay , no vision , no voice , only a remembrance . But when I uttered it aloud , soon there came a breeze blowing me back home , and seals and dolphins gamboled all about under the moon . " He placed the big , scarred sailor 's hands on his hips , stood astraddle next to the second servant of Taranis , looking down at the high priestessp433of Belisama , and said : " This is my simple thought . That Lir be honored , let the temple of Mithras also be hostage to Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come so high as they do today . In the seaward towers are rooms which 're below the waves , abandoned on that account . I 've been to see , and one at the bottom of the Raven Tower would do fine . ' T was never meant for more than a storage cellar ; no windows . Dripping wet , but that can be fixed . ' T is lower than anything he could dig ashore , so ' t is a cave , better than trickery with a warehouse . And  --  I met Mithras folk when I was young , abroad  --  the raven is a holy bird to them . What happier sign could Grallon ask for ? Or we ? " Again silence , but for the rain . Air slithered , candle flames guttered . " I see , " Lanarvilis finally murmured . Her head was bowed ; Soren could no longer read her face . " You understand , do n't you ? " the Speaker asked eagerly . " If Gratilloniuswill accept this , every faction should be satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She lifted her glance to confront his . " You want my help , " she said , flat-voiced , " because you know he is no fool . He 'll know that this means placing Mithras under Lir . " " Nay , not really . A gesture of respect , and should there not be respect between Gods ? Lir gives Mithras this fine site . Mithras , in turn , acknowledgesthat Lir , that the Three are the patrons of Ys . " Soren leaned forward . Impetuously , he reached across the table betweencouch and chair . Blindly , Lanarvilis did likewise . Their hands met and clung . Hannon sat back down , folded his arms , rested like a reef outside Sena . " You want me to . . . persuade the King , " Lanarvilis said . " First , we suppose , persuade your Sisters , " replied Soren . " Make the Gallicenae work together on Gratillonius till he agrees . " " I expect we can , " Lanarvilis said . " You can do so much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The power that lies in women ! " She withdrew her hands , sat straight , and told him , " Most of that power comes from patience , Soren , from endurance . " He snatched a cup and half emptied it in a gulp , though the wine had not been watered.  |p434Some  thirty miles east of Ys lay the head of navigation on the River Odita . Thence the stream flowed south for about ten miles to the sea . These were birdflight distances ; it was longer for a man , whether he went by land or water through the winding valleys of Armorica . There a Romanveteran had taken the lead in founding a colony , three hundred years ago . It was actually a little below the farthest north a ship could reach when tide was high ; that point was just above the confluence of the Odita with the lesser Stegir . He chose the site because of its handiness to a Gallic settlement and hill fort on the heights behind . Those had long since been abandoned , leveled by man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced them , though for the most part Mons Ferruginus was unpeopled , a woodland through which a few trails wound . The Roman named the colony Aquilo , from the Aquilonian district of Apuleia in Italy whence he hailed . Sufficiently inland not to fear surprise attack by pirates , it became a minor seaport . Here entered wares of metal and glass , olives , oil , textiles . Out went mainly products of the heavily forested hinterland , hides , furs , nuts , pigskin , preserved meat , tallow , honey , beeswax , timber  --  but also salt , beneficiated iron ore , preserved fish , garum sauce , and the marvelous things they wrought in gold , silver , ivory , shell , and fabric in Ys . The fortunes of Aquilo waxed and waned with those of the Empire . However , its leadership stayed in the hands of the founderis descendants . These Apuleii intermarried with their Osismiic neighbors and folk of other cantons until by blood they were almost purely Armorican . In their lives they stayed Roman , even claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sent their elder sons to be educated at such centers of learning as Durocotorum , Treverorum , and Lugdunum . Eventuallythey won elevation to senatorial rank . As such , they were no longer supposed to engage in trade ; but they had ample relatives to serve as their agents while they devoted themselves to civic and  --  increasingly of recent decades  --  military affairs . Gratillonius had passed through three years before , on his mission of keeping the western end of the peninsula quiescent while Maximus warred . Now , when he returned , Apuleius Vero made him heartily wel/come . They had struck it off at once , in spite of the host being a devoted Christian . After all , the centurion served Rome too ; he had fascinating things to tell of the city in his charge ; he was making possible a revival of commerce . For his part , Apuleius was well-traveled , well-read , experienced in the ways of the world . After his student days in the South he had dreamed of a public career , and begun by becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father laid on him the duty of coming back and taking over a post in which Gratillonius considered him wasted . Likely Apuleius would have agreed , save that Roman virtue and Christian piety both forbade him to complain against fate . " You wish to strengthen further the ties between Ys and the Gauls ? " he asked when they were alone . " Why ? Not that the resumption of dealings has n't profited everybody . It has , and nowhere more than in my poor Aquilo . However , the Empire is again tranquil , and the barbarians have drawn in their horns since that disaster the Scoti suffered . Can trade not grow of itself ? " He was a slender man in his mid-thirties , of medium height , darkhaired , straight-nosed , clean-shaven , with large hazel eyes whose nearsightednesscaused him to wear an appearance of intense concentration . Somehow he seemed to Gratillonius more Hellenic than Roman , perhaps because in his quiet fashion he took pride in a bloodline going back to Magna Graecia . As the man sat , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts they had been enjoying . She was young , comely , the daughter of an Osismiic headman . Since their marriage two years ago , Apuleius had been teaching her the manners of a senatorial matron ; but she had never lacked inborn gentility . They had a single child thus far , a girl , and another swelled within her . Gratillonius weighed his reply . He had rehearsed it in his mind , for he would need it repeatedly , but this was the first time . " I 'm afraid that tranquility is only on the surface , and ca n't last much longer , " he said . " You 've heard of the Priscillianist business last year ? " Apuleius grimaced . " Ugly , from what little I know . Unworthy of the Faith . But it 's behind us now , praise God . Is n't it ? " " I 'm not sure . " Gratillonius frowned into a lampflame . The floor of the house was warm from a hypocaust , but the air kept a chill , and outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays divided , and it and the Empire are woven together . Maximus accuses Valentinianus of heresy . It may be just a pretext . But what a dangerous pretext ! No , I do n't think we 've seen the end of civil war . "  | " God help us , " Apuleius said sorrowfully . " But what can we do , you and I ? We 're nothing but minor officers of the state . How can you bypass the Duke of the Armorican Tract ? " Gratillonius smiled . " You think I might take too much on myself ? Well , I am the prefect of Rome , not of Maximus Angustus but of Rome , in Ys , which is not a province but a sovereign ally and has made me its King . I read that as meaning I 've got discretion to act in the public interest as I see it , and answer for my actions afterward . . . to the proper authority . " " That would be the Duke , would n't it ? How will he feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be cocky , Apuleius , but I 'm not crazy . I wrote and got his leave to , m-m , do what seems best to develop further those good relations between Ys and the Roman communities on which a start has lately been made . ' The Duke 's no dunderhead either . He recognizes the facts , no matter how he has to gloss them over . First , he 's necessarily most concerned with the eastern and inland parts of the peninsula . I can do in the west what he can not , and he knows it . Second , he never was happy about Maximus 's rebellion . He hinted pretty strongly , in writing to me , that my aims please him . " " I see . . . . But what are they ? " " This : that western Armorica , and as much else of it as I can reach , not get embroiled in any new fighting . That we refuse demands on us to come help kill our fellow Romans , in anybody 's cause . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gratillonius nodded . " I think , if we do stand together in this resolution , I think he 'll know better than to order us to break it . Later , if he prevails  --  well , at least we Armoricans will be strong enough to have some say in what happens to us . And he might not prevail . " " Valentinianus is weak , " Apuleius mused , " but if Theodosius should take a hand  --  " A tingle went through Gratillonius . " It could be . Who knows ? In which case Armorica might expect quite favorable treatment . A daydream , maybe . I do n't tell myself any nursery tales about us making the difference in what happens . I just think our chances will be better , and Rome will be better served , if Armorica looks after its own , unitedly . " " Under Ysan leadership . " Gratillonius shrugged . " Who else is taking the initiative ? Besides , Ys is the natural leader of this whole region . " He grew earnest . " Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor  --  I 've no ambitions for myself . " Inwardly , fugitively , he wondered . The world groaned in its need for ap437man who could set things right . Why could nobody else see what must be done ? It was so simple . Government firm , just , obedient to its own laws ; military reforms and the taming of the barbarians ; honest currency ; reductionof taxes , of every burden that was destroying the productive classes ; liberation of the individual man from bondage to the estate to which he was born ; religious toleration  --  nothing else , really , than what he had hoped Maximus would enact . But Gratillonius had no legions to hail him Emperor . He would do well if he could save Ys for Mithras and Dahut . If he was very fortunate , he might save Armorica . Give him that and he would lie down contentedly on his deathbed , knowing he had been a good son of Rome . Apuleius considered him a while before saying , " I think I 'll believe you . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you and I really know  --  " a hint of bitterness  --  " in these backwaters where we sit ? " " I 've been out , " Gratillonius replied . " Last year , for months , over much of Gallia . I spoke with men as various as Maximus himself in Treverorum and Ausonius  --  well , an old , learned man in Burdigala . " Apuleius sat straight . " What ? " he exclaimed . " Ausonius ? Why , I studiedunder him . How is he ? " Gratillonius gladly let conversation go in that direction . Apuleius 's admiration for Ausonius was not unalloyed . Arriving in Burdigala while Julianus the Apostate still reigned , himself at the vulnerable , combative age of twelve , he had  --  as he wryly admitted  --  changed from an indifferent to a prayerful Christian largely in reaction against the coolness or outright paganism he encountered everywhere around him . Ausonius , he felt , was a man of antiquity , born out of his time , who accepted Christ with the same impersonal politeness he would earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ausonius had such riches to give ... . The evening ended a trifle drunkenly and altogether cheerily . Morning was lucent . Gratillonius made it an excuse for staying another day . He would take advantage of the weather to do what he had not had time to do on his previous visit , ride around the countryside and get a little familiarity with it  --  for purposes of military planning if that need should arise , he told Apuleius . His host smiled , and declined to accompany him . Apuleius was no outdoorsman . He kept fit with methodical exercises , as a duty , but gavep438his leisure to his books , correspondence , religious observances , family , and whatever intelligent conversation came his way . He offered to assign Gratillonius a guide , but the latter refused in his turn and rode off alone . The fact was that he wanted solitude , as a man does now and then . It was hard to find when he must always be either the King of Ys , the prefect of Rome , or a centurion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were escorting him , to take their ease with the Aquilo garrison . This consisted of some infantry recruited mostly among the local Osismii and a few horsemen . Younger men of the civil populationformed a reserve that would augment it in times of emergency . The Duke had never felt that more strength was needed here . True , pirates often ravaged the estuary  --  a few years ago they wrecked the lovely villa of the Pulcher family  --  and occasionally rowed upstream ; but to date they had always been driven off short of the city . Ruinous though Vorgium was , the main force in these parts continued to be stationed there . Gratillonius was soon out of Aquilo . On the left bank of the Odita , it amounted to a few hundred homes  --  cob , timber , brick , the elegant but small town house of the Apuleii  --  together with such establishments as a church , a smithy , a marketplace , and a couple of warehouses down by the harbor . Smoke seeped from thatch roofs or curled out of holes in tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip ; wheels creaked ; an anvil rang . This late in the year , no merchant vessels lay docked , and Gratillonius did not go out that gate and over the bridge to the west . Instead , he took the eastern portal . The walls around the city were of the old Gallic sort , earth over interlocked logs reinforced with rubble , wooden blockhouses at the corners . On his right , as he followed a dirt road upstream , was a narrow strip of lowland , behind which rose that long , high hill called Mons Ferruginus . Dwellings dotted it , well-nigh lost to view among the reds , bronzes , golds of autumnal woods . Most migratory birds had departed but heaven was bewinged by crows , sparrows , robins , a falcon afar . After a short distance , he saw the lesser Stegir flow from the north and join the Odita on the opposite side . Past that was a bridge to cross , whose planks boomed underhoof . On the farther shore the land rolled gently . He left behind him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent south , and took a rutted road paralleling the Stegir . It led him through cultivated land , the estate of the Apuleii . He saw the cottages of three tenant families . Beyond them he passed the manor house . Its owner used it mostly as a retreat . Sere weeds and brambles filled much former plowland , with saplings as outrunners of the wildwood in the offing . Lack of markets , lack of labor  --  how much of this had he come upon !  |p439His  spirits revived after the road , becoming scarcely more than a path , took him into the forest . That began about where the channel of the Stegir shifted west . It walled in the farmland on two sides . Mainly it was oak , though beech , maple , ash , and other trees made it at this season a storm of color . There was scant underbrush ; deer kept that down , as well as the swine that boys herded . The ground was a softness of soil and old leaves , with fallen boles on which moss grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vision faded off into sun-spattered shadows . The air was cool , moist , smelling like mushrooms . He rode on for a timeless time , letting his thoughts drift . And then , abruptly , a stag stepped into view ahead of him , a glorious beast with a mighty rack of antlers . He reined in . It stopped and stared down the path at him . He had brought a bow along in case of such luck . His hand stole down to unsling it , take an arrow , nock , aim . The stag bounded off . The shaft missed . " Harroo ! " Gratillonius shouted , and urged his mount into gallop . A while the chase thundered over the ruts . Gratillonius 's big gelding narrowed the gap . The stag veered and went off among the trees . Gratilloniusfollowed . Of course it was in vain . He dared not keep on at full unheeding speed where a root or a burrow might cause his horse to snap a leg . The quarry soared now right , now left , until presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mount whickered , breathed hard , stood sweating . The man 's oath was good-natured . He had n't really expected to take the prey . The challenge had merely been irresistible , and he 'd gotten a grand run . Best he return to his route . He wanted to reach cleared countryon the far side of the woods and survey it before he must start back . He had ridden for a spell when it came to him that he should already have been on the road . How could he have missed it ? Every direction looked the same , and a haze had drawn over the sky to obscure the sun . What he sought was no spear-straight Roman highway but a track that twisted to and fro like the ancient game trail that doubtless underlay it . He could cast about for hours , randomly seeking a random goal . He swore with more feeling . The anger was at himself . He had imaginedthat in the past few years he had learned to control a quick temper , an impulsiveness , that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing was not dead in him ; it had been lying low , biding its chance to spring forth . " Gone astray , lured off by a deer , like a chieftain in a folk tale , " he muttered . " I 'll never hear the end of this . "  |p440To  be sure , if he could get back before dark , he need n't confess ... . When he studied the sky carefully , bearing in mind the time of day and year , he established which way was south . The Stegir was certain to be somewhere yonder . Having reached it , he could follow it till it met the Odita . The quest proved long . The forest floor was only partly clear . Often he must work through or around brush , logs , or pools . When at last he found the stream , the going along it was no better . The sun went out of sight . Murk and chill welled from the earth . He realized that night would overtake him . To struggle on would be foolhardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable as possible while he waited for dawn . He had taken with him just a piece of bread and cheese , long since eaten . His belly growled . The Stegir gurgled around a thicket . Having passed this , he suddenly came upon a hut . A trail , narrow but clear , went thence , doubtless toward the road . Gladness jumped within him . He would still have to spend the night , but here was shelter , and a quick journey come morning . He drew rein and dismounted . His horse 's head drooped , as exhausted as the poor beast was . The hut was tiny , a cylinder of wicker and clay , moss-chinked , under a conical thatch roof . A hide hung from a stick in place of a proper door . He had seen better housing among the Picti . However , the oak whose boughs arched above was magnificent . " Hail , " he called . " Is anybody home ? " The gloomy depths around blotted up his voice . The hide crackled aside and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of gauntness . A crag of nose and headland of chin jutted from a long , hollow-cheeked face ; the black eyes were set deep under shaggy brows ; the stiff black hair and beard , roughly haggled , were shot with white . He wore a coarse linsey-woolsey robe , belted with a rope . The bare feet were calloused and begrimed . Clearly he had not bathed at any recent time , if ever , although an outdoor life made his odor pungent , a bit smoky , rather than sour . " Peace be with you , " he said in Latin . His voice was rather harsh . " Are you lost ? " He smiled , showing large teeth . " You seem to be a stranger to these parts , and at this hour I doubt you 've come for counsel . " " I am Gratillonius , a soldier , and I have certainly missed my way . Is Aquilo very far ? " " No , but too much for you to reach before nightfall , my son . May I offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermit . " The man looked up between boughs to gray-purple heaven , sniffed the air , and nodded . " We 'll have rain in a while . At least my roof is tight . "  | " Thank you . " Gratillonius hesitated . He did n't want to impose on poverty . " Could I , in return , help or  --  or make a donation ? " " You may make an offering to the Church if you wish . I myself have no needs that God and these two hands can not fill . " Corentinus regarded him . " You must be famished . It 's not my habit to eat more than once a day , but I 'll prepare you something and  --  " the laugh rang  --  " he would be a rude host who did n't share with his guest . " Gratillonius led his horse to drink , unsaddled and rubbed it down , tethered it nearby to graze on some herbage that kept a few withered leaves . Meanwhile he cast mind back over what he knew about hermits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have originated in Egypt , was spreading northward through Europe , devout Christians going off to be alone with their God , away from the temptations of the world and even the distractions of the Church . Believers , including otherwise pagan countryfolk , often sought out such holy men , who must surely have wisdom and powers beyond the ordinary . This Corentinus did n't seem quite to fit the picture . If nothing else , he looked too robust ; and he must once have been fairly well educated . Turning from his chores , Gratillonius saw him , robe hiked over knobblyknees , squatting in the burn . Its iciness made no visible difference to him . He murmured  --  a prayer ?  --  and reached underwater . After a moment he rose . A large trout lay in his hands . Lay ! Eeriness touched Gratillonius . The fish was alive ; its sheen in the fading light showed it to be healthy ; but it did not flop , and it had come straight into that grasp . " God provides , you see , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut . Half stunned , Gratillonius followed . The interior was dark , save for a small , banked fire on the dirt floor , which gave just enough light to work by if you knew where everything was . Corentinus took a knife that rested on a slab with a few other objects . " Be you blessed , little brother , " he said , " and be God thanked for His manifold mercies . " With a deft motion he sliced the flesh from one side of the trout and tossed the piece down . Gratillonius sucked in a breath of astounded outrage . He had never condoned cruelty to animals , and this was wanton . Yet the fish only waved its tail . Before Gratillonius could speak , Corentinushad gone back out . Gratillonius came after , automatically . The hermitcast the half filleted creature into the stream and signed the air with the Cross . Gratillonius gasped again . The trout was swimming off as if unharmed  --  and was it in fact whole , healed ? He grew aware that Corentinus had laid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone : " Fear not , my son . What you beheld is nop442sorcery . It happens daily , unless I am fasting . Thus God keeps me fed . Why He should vouchsafe such grace to me , a wretched sinner , I know not , but He surely has His purpose . Now let 's go settle ourselves and talk . You look like a man with good stories in him , and I must admit that in my weakness I can grow weary of seeing nobody except an occasional rustic . " Gratillonius mustered will . He had witnessed things stranger than this , in and around Ys , and some of them had been malignant , whereas Corentinusseemed wholly benign . " Remarkable , " he heard himself say . " A miracle . " Corentinus waved . " And yet is not all Creation a miracle ? Look around you , my son , and think . " He led the way inside and urged his guest to take the stool that was his single item of furniture . In quite everyday fashion he laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkered down to roast it above the coals . " It 's better baked , " he said , " but as hungry as you must be , I wo n't make you wait for that . You 'll find hardtack in yonder box . Dried peas and things too , but , again , I do n't want you to endure the time it would take to cook them . No wine or ale available , I fear . " He grinned . " Who dines with a hermit must take short commons . " " You are . . . very kind . " The fire , poked up into sputtering flames , picked sights out of shadow . He saw a towel , a spare robe , a blanket hung from pegs in the sooty wall . No bed . Well , he had his horse blanket and cloak , with the saddle for a pillow . The implements he glimpsed were of the crudest , except for that excellent sharp knife . ( Corentinus must not want his wondrous fish to feel pain at being carved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass basket , a couple of wooden bowls and spoons  --  No , wait . As far as possible from the hearth was a second slab . Upon it , wrapped in fine linen , rested what Gratillonius recognized as a book , doubtless a Christian Gospel . Through the smoke-tang he began to smell cooking meat . His mouth watered . Corentinus looked across at him and grinned anew . Highlights traced the big bones of his face , ruddy amidst murk , and the whiteness of his teeth . " Brace up , lad , " he said . " We 'll soon have some cargo down your hatch . " The Latin had turned accented and ungrammatical , commonerspeech . " How long have you lived here ? " the centurion asked . Corentinus shrugged . " Time ceases to have meaning after a few seasons of seeking eternity . " Again he talked like a schooled man . " Um-m . . . five years ? " " I had n't heard of you , though I visited Aquilo three years ago . "  | " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more interesting , Gratillonius . " " What , when you can do magic like this ? " Corentinus scowled . " Please ! I said it is no sorcery , no pagan trick . I do n't do the thing . When I had first fled my sinfulness , an angel of the Lord appeared to me in a dream and told me of the divine favor I was given . I did n't know what it meant , I was bewildered and frightened . After all , the Devil had come in the same guise , no , in the guise of the very Christ , to my holy father Martinus , and tried to deceive him . " His tone softened . " Oh , I had to rally my nerve , I can tell you . But what could I do except obey ? And behold , my little brother swam quietly into my hands , just as you saw ; and I understood that God 's mercy is infi-nite . " Gratillonius wrestled with his honor and lost . He cleared his throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm no Christian myself . " " Oh ? " Corentinus seemed no more than mildly surprised . " You , an officer who goes around on what must be important missions ? " " Well , I  --  All right , sir . I follow the Lord Mithras . " Corentinus looked long at him . " It 's well for you that you did n't dissemble , my son . I do n't matter , but God does n't like false pretenses . " " No . My God does n't . . . either . " " You may wish to reconsider , after what you 've seen this evening . " Gratillonius shook his head . " I do n't deny your God has powers . But I will not deny mine . " Corentinus nodded . " I 'd begun to suspect you were not of the Faith . Your behavior , your stance , everything . I knocked around in the world before coming here . " " If you do n't want me under your roof , I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corentinus raised his free hand . " God forbid ! You 're a guest . A most welcome one , I might add . " He smiled a bit wistfully . " I 've no hopes of converting you in a single night , and know better than to try . Let 's just swap yarns . But . . . you spoke of making me some return for hospitality . If you really mean it , then what you shall do is think . Look around you at God 's world and ask yourself how it could have come to be and what this life of ours is all about . Think . " He paused . " No , I 'll not ask that you pray for guidance . You could n't , if you 're as true a worshipperof Mithras as you seem to be . I do ask that you open your mind . Listen . Think . " After a brief silence : " Well , I believe supper is ready ; and you have n't yet gotten out the flatbread ! " He insisted Gratillonius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a token of friendliness . There was nothing but water to drink . Regardless , the two men soon fell into talk that lasted through the rain till the sunrise . Corentinus took fire at what Gratillonius told about Ys . He had been there once , as a crewman on one of the few outside ships that called ; he had toured its wonders and , he admitted without breast-beating , its resortsof sin . That Ys was coming back into the Roman sphere struck him as a happy portent . Indeed , despite his isolation , he was astonishingly well-informed . Mentionof Priscillianus grieved but did not surprise him ; he had known . It turned out that he still got occasional letters from his mentor Martinus . As for his past , he was the son of a Britannic immigrant to Osismia , born on the fundus of a well-to-do , thoroughly Romanized family . There he received a good basic schooling , though he was more interested in ranging the woodlands or galloping the horses . ( He and Gratillonius found kindred memories to chuckle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the general ill health of commerce , the depredationsof the barbarians , and the grinding down of the curials . ( Now the two could be grim together . ) At the age of fifteen , Corentinus got out from under the ruin and went off on his own . Through what connections remained to him he obtained a berth on a ship , the law being winked at , and spent the next several years as a sailor , a rough man in a rough life . Finally a storm blew his vessel so far out to sea that the crew despaired of winning back . Most perished miserably in the attempt , in spite of forgetting whatever Christianity was theirs and making horrid sacrifices to other Gods . Corentinus saw visions in his delirium . When at last he reached the Liger mouth , once he had regained strength he made his way to Pictavum , where Martinus then was , Martinus of whom Corentinus had never before heard from any human mouth . This man gave him instruction while he settled into the monastic community . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , and was delighted to accompany Martinus when the latter went to Turonum ; to take baptism at the hands of Martinus after Martinus became the bishop ; to aid in the effort to evangelize the countryside  --  until he fell from grace with a heathen woman . Aghast at himself , he asked leave to seek forgivenessthrough penance , and returned to Osismia to become an anchorite . There it was revealed that , despite everything , God had not cast him off.  --  Gratillonius re-entered Aquilo full of thought.  |p445As  closely as it followed winter solstice , the Birthday of Mithras at Ys gave a glimmer of daylight , barely more than six hours , in a cavern of night . Before sunrise , walls on either side made the pomoerium brim with darkness . Air was bitterly cold . Beyond the rampart growled the sea , and above it skirled the wind . Yet Gratillonius dared hope he saw a good omen in the stars flickering overhead . Lanterns bobbed , brought faces half out of shadow , made grotesqueries flutter across stone . Buskins clicked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession up the stairway . The Raven Tower bulked foursquareout into the surf , its battlements like shields raised against heaven . Sentries , who had been told what to expect , saluted and stepped aside . Lantern-glimmer showed awe on one countenance , misgiving on another , stiffness on the third and fourth . The door stood open . Gratillonius and his followers entered the turret . A stairwell gaped before them . They mounted , came forth on top , looked across the parapet to the dawn . It whitened above inland hills , turned their ridges hoar , crept down the valley , while stars went out . The towers of Ys caught it in a flash of copper , gold , and glass . The roofs of Ys rose from murk like whales from the sea . Beyond them Point Vanis reared and brightened . Closer by , Cape Rach thrust ruggedly forth . Shifting illumination made it seem as if the old dead were stealing back to their sleep in the necropolis . The pharos smoked briefly  --  its keeper had snuffed the flame  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off reefs , out to Sena and on across the curve of the world . Drifts of kelp darkened it here and there ; seals tumbledabout in the waves . There were a few minutes to wait . Men stood contemplative or talked in low voices . Gratillonius and his father drew aside , until they looked down on the finger of sea that reached between headland and city wall , east toward Aurochs Gate . Thus confined , the water dashed noisily against stone and a strip of beach . Gloom still dwelt in that gap , but glints went like fire . " The moment draws near , " said Marcus Valerius Gratillonius . " At last , " answered Gaius his son . Marcus smiled one-sidedly . " I never believed those historians who put ringing periods in the mouths of leaders when a great event is about to happen . Real people mumble words worn smooth of meaning . "  | " Well , we can keep silence . " Gaius 's gaze strayed west toward the seals and Sena . Did the shade of Dahilis really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus summoned resolution . " Except for this . It 's not too late to turn back . Not quite . " Gaius sighed . " It always was . I 'm sorry , father . " Since a delegation of Ysan marines , and the legionary Cynan for spokesman , sought him out at the villa in Britannia this past summer and brought him here in the royal yacht , Marcus had questioned the wisdom of establishing a Mithraeum  --  so lavish , too  --  in this of all cities . True , the King had overcome opposition , but he had not quelled it in many hearts , and those were only the hearts of men . Nonetheless Marcus had accepted the instruction and ultimately the consecration that raised him to Runner of the Sun . How strange it felt to Gaius , to be the guiding Father over this man who had brought him into being . " I understand , " Marcus said , almost meekly . He had aged much in the past few years . " Forget my croakings . We 'll build Him His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day was advancing . " Good for you , sir ! " Gaius blurted . Marcus plucked at the sleeve of the hierophantic robe . " Afterward we 'll have time for ourselves , wo n't we ? " he whispered . Gaius squeezed the bowed shoulder . " Of course . I promise . " Between royal and Roman duties , the King had had small opportunity thus far to be with his palace guest , and then it had mostly gone to preparing the latter for his role this morning . Fortunately , Marcus had been glad to explore the city and enjoy his grandchildren , Dahut the foremost . Come spring , he must return home , lest that home crumble from the hands of the family . He and his son did not suppose they would ever meet again . But first they could lighten the Black Months for each other . That was why Gaius had sent for Marcus . He could more readily have elevated somebody else . Soon he must do so . By issuing invitations during the year , he had gained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two Occults , a Lion , two Persians . Additionally , he had seen Cynan through to the rank of Soldier , Verica and Maclavius to Lion . That was all he had . Light flared . The sun rose over the hills . Gaius Valerius Gratillonius led his men in hymn and prayer . Before they went below , he raised a hand in salute to Point Vanis , where rested the bones of Eppillus.  |p447Candles  in holders of gilt bronze waited inside the tower . With these the party descended . The uppermost room was a watchpost and rain shelter , the next pair were given over to storage . Farther on they echoed empty ; those times were past when the treasures of Ys had overflowed into them . Walls sweated , air grew dank , flames streamed smoky , as the stairs went down below the surfFinally came a space refurbished . Hidden ducts ventilated the fires of a hypocaust that kept it warm and dry . Statues of the Torchbearers flanked a doorway . A mosaic floor in black and white showed emblems of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed frescos of the tree that nourished infant Mithras and of His reconciliation with the Sun . Benches stood beneath , and a table bearing food , drink , and utensils for the sacred meal . A new wall with its own door shut off the sanctum . With holy water sprinkled off pine boughs , with incense of pine cones , with wine and honey upon each tongue , the Gratillonii led the dedication . Thereafter it was time to go back above and hymn the noonday sun . It glimmered wan , low in the south . Clouds were gathering , wind shrilled , seas ran white-crested . The men returned to the Cave of Mithras . Only Father , Runner , Persians , and Lions passed through to the sanctuary ; the rest had their lesser devotions to perform in the pronaos . The King of Ys could well honor the God from the East . Here the Dadophori were sculptured again , in their faces , eyes , postures something not quite Greek or Roman , fluid and sleek , like a wave or a seal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The font was the carven calyx of a flower . The four emblems in the floor led the gaze onward , past benches above which glistened symbols of the planets , to the twin altars at the far end , where Mithras arose from the Rock , and to the high relief of the Bullslaying that filled yonder wall . The ceiling was deep blue , with golden stars . Candles stood ready in sconces , lamps in niches , to give brightness once they were lit . Soon here , too , resin sweetenedthe air , along with incense . Pater and Heliodromos trod forward . Together they led the rites . Afterward came the Sacrifice , for all initiates . On this unique occasion it began with blood . Cynan , having been duly purified , brought in a caged dove which he had gone to fetch in the course of exercises outside . MarcusGratillonius took it forth and held it tight while Gaius cut its head off with a clean slash and let it bleed into a golden bowl . Cynan bore this and the remains into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravens would immolate them . Meanwhile the Gratillonii enacted the subjugation and coronation of the Sun by Mithras.  |p448Finally  they officiated over the divine meal which the lower ranks served the higher , a foretaste of the soul 's ascent after death . Upon this great occasion it was fare less frugal than was customary : beef , subtle seasonings on the vegetables , honeycakes , the best of wines drunk from silver cups . When it was finished , Gaius Valerius Gratillonius gave benediction , and the men departed for the upper earth . Weather hid the sunset . Nevertheless they said their prayers atop the Raven Tower before they bade one another farewell . Gratillonius made his voice hearty as he did . Inwardly there remained a wistfulness . He had seen the Spirit enter certain of the worshippers ; from Cynan it had fairly flamed . Nothing had touched him akin to the divine fire that lighted his consecration . Or had it ? The God revealed Himself in forms as infinitely various as the forms and signs of love . Was the feeling of completion , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Well done " to His soldier , while also reminding him that the establishment of a lonely outpost was not in itself any victory ? Night fell upon son and father as they made their way back to the palace . Wind yelled , drove rain and scud before it , filled streets with chill . Under the sea wall , tide ramped and snarled.  |p449The  equinoctial gales blew out of Ocean like longings , to wake the soul from winter drowse . When a milder air had borne Marcus off , Gaius Gratillonius felt a redoubled need to be away himself , in action . Luckily  --  perhaps  --  there was a call upon him that neither Gallicenae nor Suffetescould deny was urgent . A letter from Maximus had scathingly denouncedhim for founding a new temple of Antichrist ; it had been inevitablethat word of that would eventually reach Treverorum . Were it not for pressing demands on his attention , the Augustus wrote , he would recall his prefect , occupy Ys , and extirpate demon worship . As it was , he must content himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The centurion had an idea of what those demands were . Indeed he had better mend fences , both temporal and ghostly . Writing to the Duke of the Armorican Tract , he requested a conference . The reply was that that high official would be in Caesarodunum Turonum for the next several months , and receive him there . It was the civil if not military capital of Lugdunensis Tertia ; the Duke doubtless had fence mending of his own to do . With a few soldiers at his back , all mounted , Gratillonius set forth . He allowed himself and them two days ' rest at Aquilo . Otherwise they pushed hard , down to Portus Namnetum and up the Liger valley . That was lovely country , freshly green and blossomful . Riding through , he felt cheer reborn in him . Why yearn for the barracks in Britannia or hope for a precarious prominence in the Empire ? Ys was his home . Its people had become his people . He could see his work on their behalf grow beneath his hands . If he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient and then some ? If none of them could bear him ap450son , did he not have Dahut ? The little darling was so bright , so headstrong . She might very well grow up to be another Semiramis , Dido , Cartimandua , Zenobia , but happier fated ; her father would lay the foundationfor that ! And , of course , his other daughters were sweet . Danger prowled around Ys , but so it did everywhere in the world . As Quinipilis was fond of saying , to borrow trouble was stupid , considering the interest rate on it . Crossing a bridge from the military highway to the left bank , his party passed through the gate of Turonum and found quarters . He was both relieved and perturbed to discover that the civil governor was absent , summoned to the Emperor along with his counterparts throughout Gallia . At least now he could confer straightforwardly with the Duke . They got along well at their first meeting . It was privately agreed that neither would send forces to any internecine conflict . They would explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . As for Gratillonius 's need of a clergyman , the Duke recommended him to Bishop Martinus . " He comes into town once a week , usually , from that monastery of his , to lead services at the main church . M-m-m , I know what you are , but it 'd be wise of you to attend them then . " Always scout ahead if you can . Gratillonius went for a preliminary look , and was shocked . The church was larger than most , and rather handsome for a building erected in recent decades . However , it was filled with madmen  --  the sick of mind and feeble of mind , ragged , filthy , some roaring , some shivering , some posturing , some taking attitudes absurd or obscene , while mutters went through the dimness . " San , san , san . . . . I am Jupiter , but they have me locked in hell . . . . Fintharingly and no , no . A deacon explained upon being asked that this was at the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wandered starveling , shunned for fear of the demons supposed to possess them , when they were not whipped off with curses , beaten , tormented , sometimesraped or killed . Martinus decreed that they be fed and sheltered in the house of God . Each Saturday he came in among them , clad in sackclothand smeared with ashes ; he lay full length on the floor in their midst , and hour after hour implored mercy for them or wrestled with the Fiend who afflicted them . His touch and his prayers had seemingly freed a number to return to the human world . The rest adored him in their various weird fashions . Gratillonius thought of his Gallicenae . They too , Innilis especially , had had a measure of luck in coping with insanity . But when they failed , thep451law of Ys was that the sufferers must be expelled . " It 's well done of the bishop , " he said . " Oh , his is a loving soul , sir , underneath the strictness , " replied the deacon . " He served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent twenty-five years before he could have the baptism he longed for , but never did his charity falter . When he was stationed at Samarobriva , I 've heard  --  not from him  --  how one freezing day he saw a near-naked beggar . He 'd already given away most of what clothes he had , but he drew sword , cut his cloak across , and let this man have half . No wonder he has power to heal . Of course , he had been a military physician . " Gratillonius decided it would be politic to absent himself until Sunday . Besides , the idea of a man groveling among the crazy repelled him . He hired a boat and went fishing . On the Lord 's day , after sunrise prayers to his own Lord , he was early at the church . This would be far from the first Christian ceremony he had watched , but he wanted to observe everything he could . The energumens were gently but firmly guided out onto the porch , where a couple of priests with the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they gave no trouble . Meanwhile the interior was cleaned and made ready . The congregation arrived piecemeal . A comparative few went inside , most of them middle-aged or elderly , the baptized . Catechumens occupied the porch ; of these , a majority were women . There was no objection to those excommunicated for sin or to unbelievers like Gratillonius , if they behaved themselves . Who knew but what the scales might fall from their eyes ? Solemnly , the bishop led his priests and deacons in . Martinus had changed little in a year and a half , save that he was freshly barbered , his sallow face smooth aside from the many furrows , his hair standing white  --  unkempt still  --  behind the ear-to-ear frontal tonsure which made his brow seem cliff-high . He wore the same slave-like garb , and went barefoot . His attendants were as humbly clad , and for the most part equally gaunt . Folk knelt while the ordained led a prayer . There followed a reading from the Prophets. "  --  Shall not the land tremble for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises up like a flood of Egypt and is cast back and drowned ?  --  " The people joined in singing a short response : "  --  Glory unto God omnipotent  --  " Standing , they heard the bishop read from an Epistle : "  --  The natural man does not receive what the Spirit of God teaches ; to him this is foolishness ; he can not know it , because it is only knowable by the spirit .  --  " A choir sang a psalm . Martinus preached the Gospel . He was no orator . In terse soldierly words , he discoursed on thep452centurion whose servant Jesus had healed . "  --  Lord , I am not worthy for You to come under my roof  --  " Gratillonius wondered about that text . For all his devotions and meditations , yonder fellow kept uncommonly aware of what went on around him . " Silence , " enjoined a deacon . While bishop and priests prayed , the offerings of the faithful were brought forth in processional , goods and money . Some were earmarked  --  for the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deacon read aloud the names of those beneficiaries , and Martinus included them in his prayer . It was the dismissal . Those in the porch left at its end . The doors behind them drew shut . What came next was the Communion service , for the baptized only . Well , Gratillonius thought , we bar our lower ranks from the highest Mysteries of Mithras . He sought an exorcist , who was helping shepherd the energumens . " I have to see the bishop , " he said , and gave his name . " Will you tell him ? I 'll be at the Imperial hostel . " " He receives supplicants  --  " " No , this has to be a private talk . Tell him it 's with the King of Ys . " The priest gaped and gulped . However , the man before him , big , healthy , well-clad , was not obviously a lunatic . To be sure , standing aside as a spectator , he had revealed himself a pagan . But Martinus dealt with many a heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for some hours yet , sir , not till he 's finished his Church business , and afterwardhis charities and austerities . Expect word about sunset . " Briefly , Gratillonius bristled ; then he eased off and laughed . Maybe Martinus washed the feet of the poor , but be damned if he toadied to the mighty ! The message that evening , carried by an awestruck boy who had memorizedit , was : " The bishop will return to the monastery immediately after worship tomorrow sunrise . He will be glad to meet you at the western city gate and have you accompany him . It will be afoot . "  --  On this side of the river , the road was unpaved . Rain had fallen during the night , and morning was cold and damp , though warming as the sun climbed . Mist smoked above the water . Dew glittered on grass and young leaves . The hills reached silvery with it . Birds twittered ; high and high , a lark chanted its " bi-bi-bi . " Few people were abroad . While Martinus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow down . A few monks who had come with him followed at a respectful distance . For a time conversation went lively between the leaders . Martinus was ardent to learn everything Gratillonius had done , seen , heard , planned ,  |p453since  their last encounter . But when talk turned to the future , his mood darkened. "  --  And so I 've got to have a minister of your faith for Ys , soon , " Gratillonius finished . " Please do n't look on it as a political move . I am what I am . From your viewpoint , too , would n't it be best we get a reasonable man like old Eucherius ? " Martinus peered afar . Somehow his thin , snubnosed countenance came to resemble a Caesar 's . " God rest Eucherius . " His tone was steely . " From what I 've heard , he did his pious best . He was weak , though . We require an evangelist there , who will take up arms against Satan . " " But not one who 'll , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause ? Give me somebody I can work with . " " Despite your own paganism . " Martinus gentled . " Oh , I understand . Yours is a sore dilemma . " " Never mind me . I 'm thinking of Ys . And Rome . What good will it do Rome if your man provokes the people into throwing him out ? Maximus would  --  Well , remember what the Priscillianus business cost . " Martinus 's knuckles whitened above his staff . " I can never forget , " he said low . Presently : " Let me confess to you . " He wrenched the words out . " For we must indeed try to understand each other , you and I , for the sake of the souls in your worldly care , and  --  and Rome . " Maximus did agree to call off his inquisitors , and to give the surviving Priscillianists in his dungeons light sentences . However , on this he put a price . As a sign of blessing , I must help celebrate the consecration of Felix as bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine man . " Martinus caught his breath . " But to share the Eucharist with Ithacius , the persecutor  --  Well , in the end , perforce , I did . " On the way home , I walked through midnight of the soul . It seemed to me that whatever powers of well-doing had been granted me by God must be gone , because of this covenant with evil . Then an angel of the Lord appeared to me and said I had done what I must and was forgiven . " He said that almost matter-of-factly , before he grew stark again : " Nevertheless , I have seen Satan at work within the Church itself . I will never attend another synod of bishops . " They trudged on in silence until Gratillonius had marshalled words : " So you realize how careful we need to be , choosing . . . a trustworthy servant of God for Ys . " Martinus had recovered calm . " I do . A man devout , learned , civilized , but also virile , familiar with the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general welfare and . . . resistance to tyranny . " He gusted a sigh. , " Do you know any such paragon ? I wish I did ! " Gratillonius 's heart leaped . He had spent a great many hours thinking about this . " Maybe I do . " By then they had nearly reached their goal , about three miles downstreamfrom Turonum . Sheer hillsides , honeycombed with caves and burrows , curved backward to wall in a broad , grassy flatland . Primitive huts covered the low area , wattle-fenced gardens among them . Although the community was said to number well over a thousand , most dwelling in the caves , few were in sight , nor did smoke rise from any but two or three shacks . This was the Greater Monastery that Martinus had founded , to which men flocked who had despaired of the world and would seek salvation beyond it . Women came too , but were housed in the city ; the bishop clove husband from wife as ruthlessly as he split away fleshliness from himself . Mostly the monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned entirely over to the Church when they enrolled . What food they grew , what fish they caught , were mere concessions to the body 's need of some recreation . They shared a single meal a day , of the simplest kind . Nearly all their waking hours they passed in prayer , contemplation , mortification , reading of Scripture , attendance on the preachingof their master . Gratillonius could not comprehend how any human being would seek such an existence . Yet as he beheld it , the power of it sent a chill through him . " Whom have you in mind ? " Martinus asked . The centurion hauled his mind back to realities . " You know him . One Corentinus . We met last year , he and I , when I blundered onto his hermitage , and hit it off . On this trip , I stopped at Aquilo mainly so I could go back there and talk with him again . It went even better . I think he 's right for Ys  --  since we must have somebody  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Hm-m . " The bishop pondered , while his feet and staff ate the distance to sanctuary . " It may be . It may be . An old seaman , posted to a seafaring folk . . . . I must think . It 's clear God has marked Corentinus for some high mission . You know about the miracle of the fish , do n't you ? Well , then  --  " More silence , apart from the scrunch of sandals , the song of birds . " I must think , and pray for guidance . But it does seem as though  --  He 'll have to return here , get instructed , be consecratedchorepiscopus . That may take months . However , I could write to Maximus that it 's in train . "  | " I 'm afraid he wo n't be willing , Corentinus , " Gratilonius warned . " What he wants to do is sit in the woods and beg forgiveness . " Also , those woods had been full of flowers , fragrances , peace . Martinus laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued him . Stay a while , you . Let 's talk this over at length . You 're a soldier ; you can survive our hospitality . If my decision is positive  --  and I suspect it will be  --  I 'll give you a letter you 'll convey to Corentinus on your way back . " Gratillonius bridled . " Sir , I am the perfect of Rome and the King of Ys . " Martinus laughed louder . " Why should you not also be God 's messengerboy ? " Early summer brought a spell of calm , light , warmth . It had prevailed for days when Quinipilis 's turn to have Dahut came , and she took the girl out on the water . " I promised her this , the first chance we 'd get , " she snapped when her manservant expressed qualms . " Would you have a high priestess break her word ? A promise to a little kid is the most sacred kind there is . And nay , we 'll not want the royal yacht or any such cluttered-up thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scot 's Landing . So get off your arse ! " As he left , the man grinned to himself . The old lady had a rasp for a tongue and a lump of butter for a heart . Maeloch was quick to arrive from the fisher hamlet under Cape Rach . His Osprey was under repair after storm damage . Meanwhile he welcomedextra earnings , and this would be a pleasant job . When he entered the Queen 's house he found woman and child on the floor playing with little animals that King Grallon had carved in wood . " Here he is , sweetling , " Quinipilis said to her charge . " We can go now . " " Oh , go , go , go ! " sang Dahut , and soared to her feet . She was taller than most three-year-olds , wand-slim , wind-swift . Beneath flaxen billows of hair , her eyes were huge , deep blue , in an exquisitely sculptured face . " We go sail ! " " The airs willing , princess , " Maeloch said . " Else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , black mane and beard , rumbling voice , caused her no alarm . It did not seem that anything had ever frightened Dahut.  | " Well , help , me up , oaf , " Quinipilis ordered with a nearly toothless smile . As he did , she caught a sharp breath . " Does something hurt , my lady ? " he asked . " Of course something does . What d' you think ' t would do , in this wreck of a body ? Like always having feet in a boiling kettle , if you must know . Let 's begone . " " Uh , better if my lady stays home . I 'll take good care of the princess , believe me . How I do remember her mother . " " Nonsense ! Should I deny me a pleasure because of some verminous twinges ? Fetch me my staff . ' T is in yon corner ; are you blind or only drunk ? Give me your arm . " Quinipilis leered . " I want all Ys to see I can yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipped with them down the winding street . Folk they met , mostly servants in livery , gave deferential salutation . Many recognized Maeloch as well as the Queen . He was not only a fisher captain , frequenterof taverns and sometimes joyhouses like most sailors ; he was a Ferrier of the Dead . " Why d'ye go in this wise ? " he wondered . " On Dahut 's account , " Quinipilis explained . " She 's ever been wild about the sea . Ca n't get close to it , or out on it , enough . " A grimness crossed Maeloch 's weathered countenance . He knew where and how the child had been born . Should that not have left a dread of the realm of Lir within her ? Instead , it was as if He had touched her then , and was forever after calling her . " Her dad takes her when he can , " Quinipilis went on , " but he has scant free time , poor fellow . And then ' t is in his yacht . The notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small boat . " Maeloch could not keep his forebodings while the bright small presence who already look so much like Dahilis skipped beside him . " We could land on a skerry I know and spend a while , " he suggested . " Might get hungry , though . " " I 'm not quite in my dotage ! We 'll have provisions aboard . " Thereafter Quinipilis must save her breath for walking . " Wan ' a ' hear a song ? " Dahut asked the man . Her hand lay tiny in his . She pointed at the woman , who smiled as if receiving an honor . " 01 ' Mama taught me . " She lifted a voice clear and true : " Starfish , starfish , what have you seenDeep in the water , deep in the green ? I saw the darkness , far from the day , Where the seals go to hunt and play . ' "  |p457From  the Forum , broad and busy Lir Way brought them through Lowtown to Skippers ' Market and the triumphal arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide had drawn the sea gate open ; but on this mild day , the basin curved almost waveless beneath the city wall . Shallops cruised back and forth , a merchant ship was standing out , more vessels lay docked , bustle went over the stone arc of the quay . Trade was reviving under the reign of Grallon . A well-stocked boat waited at a slip as Quinipilis had ordered . They went aboard . Maeloch cast off , put oars in tholes , rowed powerfully . They passed between the awesome doors of the gate . He found sufficient breeze that he could step and stay the mast , set sail , pole it out for a broad reach , and merely steer . It whispered , the breeze , cooling the brilliance that flooded from above and dusted diamond-sparkle across the sea . It stirred , the sea , in low waves that somehow moved as one , like a single huge being gently breathing in its sleep . Today whiteness did not shatter on the cliffs or the strewn reefs , only swirled and murmured . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kelp bed rocked , or a swimming gull or cormorant . Such birds wheeled aloft in their multitudes , seldom crying . Dahut 's gaze winged out among them , on past the dim streak that was Sena , to the line where vision met worldedge and lost itself in sky . Her heed returned when a seal drew near . There were always many of the beasts around Ys , they being protected . Most were plunging through the water or basking on rocks . This one met the boat and swam alongside , a few feet away . Often it looked at Dahut , and she looked back , losing her earlier excitement , becoming mute and motionless though appearing very happy . " That 's strange , " Maeloch said after a while . His voice , which could outshout storms , was hushed . " Dolphins 'll play thus with a craft , but scarce ever a seal . " Quinipilis nodded . " I think I ken it , " she answered as low . Clear sight remained to her . " Yon particularly beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those big eyes . Could be the same as was there when the babe went overside . You 've heard ? I glimpsed it . And a few times since on the beach  --  " " A seal saved me and my crew once . Guided us home through a fog , when else we 'd sure have run aground . " Quinipilis nodded . " We 're both wont to signs of the Otherworld , nay ? As close as we are to it , in our different ways . " She glanced at Dahut . " Sea child . " The girl returned to playfulness when Maeloch dropped sail and rowedp458to that skerry he had mentioned . It was large of its kind , an islet , bare rock but strewn with weed , shells , bleached and contorted sticks of driftwood . Tidepools gleamed on its lower ledges . She clapped her hands and caroled . Maeloch lay to , hung out rope bumpers , jumped ashore with the painter and made fast to an upright thumb of stone . " Come ye , sweetling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . ' Twould n't do having the barnacles cut those wee feet . " He assisted Quinipilis , then brought a chair and parasol carried along for her , then set out luncheon , while Dahut scampered round and round , shouting at each new marvel she discovered . After they had all refreshed themselves he led her by the hand , explaining things as best he could . Quinipilis watched , smiled , sometimes talked in an undertone to nobody he saw . At last he said , " Well , Princess , best we be starting home . " Dahut 's face clouded . " Nay , " she answered . " We must . The tide 's turning . That 'll help your poor old Uncle Maeloch , for the wind 's down and he 'll have to row a lot . But if we wait too long , the tide 'll close the gate , and we 'll have to make for Scot 's Landing , and your poor old Aunt Quinipilis ca n't get up the cliffs there . " The child stuck out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay . I b'long here . " " Not the way the sun 's putting a flush in that white skin of yours , ye do n't . No mutiny , now . Ye can play till I 've stowed our gear . " Dahut whirled and sped from him . When Maeloch returned to Quinipilis he found she had dozed off in her chair , as the aged do . He left her alone while he loaded the boat . Always he kept half an eye in Dahut 's direction . She had gone down to the water and become quiet . The rock sloped in such wise that could see merely the fair top of her head . Having finished his task , he gave Quinipilis a slight shake . She drew a rattling breath and blinked confusedly . " Dahilis  --  " she mumbled . Her senses steadied . " Oh , my , such eldritch dreams I was having . " Painfully , she hobbled to the boat and got in with Maeloch 's assistance . The sailor went after Dahut . " Time to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledge beneath him , the girl was side by side with the seal . Maeloch saw that the animal was female . Her narrow , earless head ( how much the head of a seal called to mind a human corpse ) had brought muzzle against cheek , through a tumble of tresses . The fishy breath seemed to give no offense . Did a murmur , a hum or a tone , resound from the long throat ? " Dahut ! " Maeloch bellowed . " What the thunder ? "  |p459The  two started , rolled apart , exchanged a look . The seal slithered into the water and dived below . Dahut leaped up . The wet body had soaked her gown so that it clung to the curves of her , which were not yet a woman 's curves but slender as if to cleave waves . Calming , she walked toward him without protest . Maeloch squatted to inspect her . " Ye 're not hurt ? " he grated . " Damnation , whatever happened ? Do n't do that sort o ' thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saw ye nay its teeth ? " " She came and sang to me , " Dahut answered like a sleepwalker . " Sang ? Huh ? Seals do n't sing . They bark . " " She did so . " Sheer willfulness brought the girl back to herself . " She sang ' bout the sea ' cos I wan'ed she should . " Turning , she called across the luminous , moving miles : " I 'll come again ! I 'll al'ays come again ! " The mood flitted from her . She gave Maeloch an impudent grin , a wink , and her hand to hold . What could he do but lead the daughter of Dahilis to the boat and take her home to her father ? He knew he would never understand what he had seen ; but he , who dealt with the dead as his forebears had done before him , need not be daunted by a mystery as tender as this . " She sang , did she ? " he asked . " She did , she did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bout my sea . " " What did she tell you ? " " I ' member . You wan ' a ' hear ? " The treble that lifted toward the gulls was childish , but the words no longer were , and the melody ebbed and flowed . It was not a song that had ever been heard in Ys . " Deep , deep , where the waters sleepAnd the great fish come and go , What do they dream in the twilight gleam ? The seals will always know . " Far , far , from the evening starComes the storm when the wind runs freeAnd the cloud that lours with the rain that pours . The seals will always see . " High , high is the evening sky , Deep is the Ocean swell . Where foam is white in the changing light , The seals will always dwell . "  |p460For  the past three years , except when it was impossible , Gratillonius had given a day every month to open court . Anybody was free to enter the basilica during those hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trouble  --  dispute , complaint , need  --  that lower authorities had failed to resolve . Turn by turn , he heard them out , and rendered judgment with military briskness . He had neither time nor patience for subtleties , though he strove to be fair . In doubtful cases he generally found for the humble . They had less to fall back on than the well-off . The setting was impressive . Tiered benches looked down toward a dais on which the King sat enthroned , the Wheel embroidered in gold on his crimson robe , the Key hanging out in view upon his breast , the Hammer across his knees . At a table to his left sat a recorder whose pen ran as fast as words were uttered , on his right a jurist with scrolls containing the laws of Ys before him . Behind the seats four legionaries in full battle gear stood at attention ; and behind them loomed the eidolons of the Three , Taranis the Father , Belisama the Mother , kraken that represented inhumanLir . On that day , a rainstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber with its susurrus . Candles in wall sconces and lamps on the desks cast their small glows , uneasy in the drafts . More people than usual had come to observe , for a notorious case was to be heard . The smell of wet wool garments gave sharpness to the air . Gratillonius heard pleaders in order of arrival . Nagon Demari registeredoutrage , but Donnerch the wagoner guffawed , when they must wait for several of the lower classes . An elderly woman stated that she did not want the charity of the Gallicenae , for her son 's widow could perfectly well pay her - support as the son himself had done ; having obtained the figures , Gratillonius so ordered . A man found guilty of theft brought friends , whom the magistrate had ruled unreliable , to declare he had been with them on the night of the crime ; Gratillonius released him on grounds of reasonable doubt , but warned that this would be taken into account if there was another accusation . A sailor declared that his captain did wrong to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay compensation for the injustice ; after several of the crew had testified , Gratillonius said , " You were lucky . I 'd have given you nine . " Thereupon it was time for Nagon Demari , Labor Councillor among thep461Suffetes , and Donnerch , son of Arel , carter . Nagon spoke at length about his beneficence in organizing the longshoremen of Ys into a guild , now that trade was improving , thanks to wise King Grallon . He made a mouth as he said that : a stocky , cold-eyed man who despite aristocratic blood had been born poor and scrabbled his way up in the world till he sat in the Council . " Spare me this and get to the point , " Gratillonius snapped . I Nagon looked indignant but explained that handling cargo obviously involved carrying it inland , wherefore carters should belong to the guild , pay its dues , require its fixed charges for their work , and perform such services for the guild as its leadership needed . Donnerch had not only refused these requests , made for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had brutally assailed two of the brotherhood who sought to persuade him . Three newcomers entered the hall . Gratillonius drew a quick breath and raised his hand . " A moment , " he interrupted . Louder : " Thrice welcome , honored sir ! " with the same repeated in Latin . Corentinus made salutation . A letter had declared he was coming , but Gratillonius had not looked for him quite this soon . He must have ridden hard , he and the two strong young men who must be deacons assigned him . The new chorepiscopus of Ys had shed much of the forest hermit . Nose , chin , cheekbones still jutted , deep-set eyes still smoldered under tangled brows , but hair and beard were neatly clipped and he had evidentlybathed at hostels where he overnighted . His head was bare , the tonsured locks drenched and matted ; but the paenula hanging from his shoulders to his knees , off which water dripped , was of good quality , and beneath it the long shanks displayed Gallic breeches tucked into boots . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell those who stood before him . " Nay , " said Corentinus . He used Osismian , but already he could throw in enough Ysan words that he was intelligible to every listener . How had he learned them ? " We have arrived early , and God forbid it be in pride . Let us abide your leisure . " He folded his height down on a rear bench . Stiffly , the deacons joined him . Donnerch answered the question in Gratillonius 's mind . " Why , I know that fellow , " he exclaimed . " Hoy-ah , Corentinus ! " He waved . The clergymansmiled and made a responding gesture . " I got as far as Turonum , trek before last , " the wagoner said , " and he heard about me being from Ys and paid me for a few days of language teaching . I earned it , lord.  |p462How  he worked me ! " He was a big young man , yellow-haired , frecklefaced , ordinarily cheerful . " May we get on with our business , 0 King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick about it , " Gratillonius replied . Presently Donnerch said : " By Epona , but he lies , him ! Hark'ee , lord . I 'd no reason for paying into his mucky guild and doing his mucky will , did I ? And so I told my fellow independent carters . Then this pair of toughs came to call on me . When they started talking about two broken arms , I snatched my mule whip off the wall . I have the cudgels they dropped on their way out , if the King wants to see ' em . Aye , they had me hauled up on charges of assault , but the magistrate did n't believe ' em , though he dared not call ' em perjurers either . So here we are . " " Perjurers ? " shouted Nagon . " Lord , I 've come on their behalf because their injuries are too cruel , too grievous , after that barbaric attack  --  " " Silence ! " Gratillonius commanded . " Think you the King is blind and deaf ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been much else for me to do , and it did seem you 'd bettered the lot of your workers somewhat . But darker stories have grown too many of late . This is only the newest of them . " " Two honest men swear , against this known drunkard and brawler , that he fell on them with a dangerous weapon , unprovoked . Poor Jonan lost an eye . Cudgels ? Donnerch could find two cudgels anywhere . " " Getting hurt is a hazard of building empires , " Gratillonius said , " and I warn you to stop trying to build yours any bigger . Free carters are not longshoremen . Henceforth , leave them alone . And . . . Donnerch , mayhap you were needlessly rough . Tell your friends that next time something like this happens , there will be a full inquiry ; and whoever has taken arms against a man without real need , he 'll know the scourge or the ax . Dismissed . " Donnerch barely suppressed a whoop , Nagon did not conceal a glower . Gratillonius wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . He needed all the support he could call on , when he must protect not a mild Eucherius but a forceful Corentinus . Luckily , just two more cases were left , and those minor . He adjourned before any further petitioners could arrive . In a rear chamber he exchangedhis robe for everyday tunic , trousers , hooded cloak . The Key felt momentarily chill against his skin . Returning , he ignored everybody else that lingered , to greet the chorepiscopus properly and have the deacons introduced to him . Those seemed like vigorous and dedicated men , but well under control of theirp463leader . " It 's good to see you again , " Gratillonius said in Latin , quite sincerely in spite of awaiting difficulties . " I hope you 'll like Ys . " " I do , " the minister answered . " Too much . As I rode in , what memoriescame back . " He squared his shoulders . " My friend , I do n't know whether you 've done me the greatest service or the scurviest trick ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must suffice me . Will you show us to the church ? " " Why , you 're here too soon . Nothing 's properly ready . I 'll quarter you in the palace till then . " Corentinus shook his head . " No , thanks . The fewer fleshly comforts and temptations , the better . To tell the truth , a reason I pushed hard on the road was fear that you , in mistaken kindness , would outfit our dwellingluxuriously . " " Well , come look , but I warn you , the place has lain neglected since Eucherius died . " " The more merit to us , " Corentinus said almost merrily , " as we make it into a fortress of God . " Gratillonius thought of his Mithraeum , also an outpost lonely and beleaguered . Let Corentinus settle in , get some rest , begin to find out for himself what Ys was  --  not only a seaport with the usual gaiety , unruliness , swindlings , sorrows , vices , ghosts , dreams . . . though in Ys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city of wealth , power , beauty , industry , corruption , vanity , arrogance , like others .. . though in Ys these flourished as they had not done elsewhere since the high days of Rome  --  but a whole society with its own ways and Gods which were not akin to those of any other , ancient , pervasive , and enduring . He , Gratillonius , had not yet fully come to terms with Ys , and he was no Christian . He hoped Corentinus would not break his heart , battering against what the evangelist must needs perceive as wickedness . They went out into the Forum and the rain . Wind sent the water at a slant , silver that glinted cold across the mosaics of dolphins and sea horses , and downward from basin to basin of the Fire Fountain at the center . The wind hooted and plucked at clothes . It bore a sound and a smell of Ocean . Hardly a soul was in sight . Gratillonius led the way across to the former temple of Mars . " Sir  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . The speaker was young Budic , who as a legionary of his had today taken a turn in the honor guard at the palace . " Sir , an Imperial courier brought this . I thought I 'd better get it to you right away , and you 'd be here-abouts . " " Well done , " said the centurion of the Second , and took a scrollp464wrapped in oiled cloth . He kept impassive , though his heart slugged and his throat tightened . Budic stood staring as he walked on . In the portico of the church he said to Corentinus : " Let me read this at once . I suspect it 's something you should know about too . " The chorepiscopus traced a cross in the wet air . " You 're probably right , " he replied . The letter was clearly one sent in many copies through Gallia , Hispania , and perhaps beyond.  --  Magnus Clemens Maximus , Augustus , to the Senate and the People of Rome , and to all others whom it may concern , charging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties laid upon them by Almighty God and the state . . . .  --  After four years of patient negotiation , it has become clear that accommodationwith Flavius Valentinianus , styled Emperor , is unattainable . . . .

The cleansing of the state , even as Our Saviour drove out money changers and demons .. . .  --  Therefore we most strictly enjoin the people and those in whose care the people are , that they remain loyal and orderly , obedient to those whom God has set above them , while we lead our armies into Italy and wherever else may prove needful , to the end that the Western Empire , harmoniously with our brother Theodosius of the East , again have tranquility under a single aid righteous ruler . An autumn storm roared , whistled , flung rain and hail , throughout one night . It made doubly comforting the warmth of Bodilis 's bed and body . By morning the weather was dry but the gale still ramped . Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other through the dimness , shared a kiss . Desire came back . He laughed , low in his throat . " There 's no call on me today , " he said , drawing her closer . That was not true . There was always something to clamor for the attention of the centurion , the prefect , the King . Only the day before , news had arrived from beyond the Alps , via the Duke of the Armorican Tract : Maximus was firmly in possession of Mediolanum and Valentinianushad fled eastward out of Italy . Gratillonius then made an excuse to visit the wisest of his Queens , out of turn , for her counsel and afterward her solace.  |p465Nevertheless   --  " Just you and me , " he said in the Latin she wanted to maintain for herself . " Later , let 's breakfast with Una , hm ? " " M-m-m , " she responded , and in other ways as well . He often thought that if he could have his wish , she would be his sole wife . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maldunilis , dumb eagerness to please of Guilvilis ; somehow , in her enough of each was alloyed . She was handsome rather than beautiful , and the years were putting gray into the wavy brown hair , crow's-feet around the blue near-sighted eyes , wrinkliness under the throat , sag in the breasts . But she was no crone , and good bones would endure . Though her monthly courses had not ended , it did not seem she would bear him more children , ever . Well , he had plenty now , and Una was a darling second only to Dahut . Before all else was the wholeness of her . She knew things , thought about them , gave him her judgments , submitted to nothing save the truth as she saw it . She was his friend , such as he had not had since Parnesius on the Wall ; and she was his lover . They met ; together they went beyond themselves ; presently they lay at peace with the universe . Outside , the wind hooted , rattled shutters , carried a noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King had barred the gate and locked it with the Key that he alone bore , lest the waters fling it open and rage into Ys . He did not expect to free those doors for a while ; and few vessels would come thereafter . As winter neared , Ys drew into itself , even as he and his Queen did this day . She chuckled . " What 's funny ? " he asked . " Oh , you , " she said . " Dutiful you , hiding away from work like a boy from the schoolmaster . It 's good to see you taking your ease , dear , merely enjoying yourself . You should do it oftener . " Reminded , he sat up . " I forgot my morning prayer ! " She arched her brows . " For the very first time ? " " Uh , no . " " I 'm sure your Mithras will understand , and overlook it . Belisama does . " Bodilis 's glance went to the figurine that occupied a niche in her otherwise plainly furnished bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hooded cloak , it showed the Goddess as a woman of middle age , serene , an enigmatic smile on Her lips . I could adore a deity like that , he thought , if this were Her only aspect . Putting solemnity aside , " We spoke of breakfast  --  " he began . A knock on the door interrupted . " My lord , my lord ! " called the voice of Bodilis 's chief manservant . " Forgive me , but a soldier of yours is here . He says he must see you this instant . " " What ? " Gratillonius swung feet to floor . His immediate feeling was ofp466resentment . Could they never leave him alone ? He took a robe off a peg and pulled it over himself . Bodilis rose too , with a rueful look for him . His deputy Adminius waited in the atrium , wearing civil Ysan garb that he had donned with unmilitary hastiness . He saluted . " Begging your pardon , sir . " The lean , snaggle-toothed countenance was full of distress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , anyway , though I 'm sure the centurion can ' andle the matter . " Gratillonius dismissed whatever happiness had still been aglow in him . " Speak . " " You got a challenger , sir . At the Wood . One o ' the lodgekeepers came asking where you was , and I thought you should ' ear it from me . " It was as if the wind came in off the street and wrapped around Gratillonius . " Do you know more ? " " No , sir . Should I go look ? I can tell ' em I could n't find yer right away . " Gratillonius shook his head . " Never mind , " he said dully . " Let me gel shod . " He turned back toward the bedroom . Having covered her own nakedness , Bodilis had followed him and heard . She stood at the inner doorway , the color drained from her face . " Oh , no , " she whispered . The hands that groped across his were cold . " Not already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brushed past her . Returning with sandals and cloak , he found she had not stirred . Those widened eyes struck remorse into him . He stopped , clasped her by the shoulders , and said , " I 'm sorry . I forgot how terrible this must be to you . A total stranger , who may be another Colconor or , or anything . Do n't be afraid . " It might be kindly of him to change from Latin to Ysan : " Nay , fear not , heart of mine . I 'll smite the wretch ere he can slice a hair off my knuckle . For your sake . " " I dare not pray , " she whispered . " This thing lies at the will of the Gods . But I 'll hope , and  --  and weep for you , Grallon , who so loathes this need laid upon him . " He kissed her , quickly and roughly , and went forth with Adminius . The wind shrilled , sent dead leaves scrittling along the street , roused little breakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making light and shadow sickle over roofs , half veiling the towertops . Rooks winged dark on the blast . The garments of such folk as were out flapped as if they too were about to fly away . " You 'll take ' im , sir , same as you did the last ' un , " Adminius avowed . " ' E'll 've ' ad a scant night 's rest in the wet . ' E ca n't be very smart , or ' e'd 've waited till later ter arrive . "  |p467Gratillonius  nodded absently . The rule that the King must respond at once to a challenge , unless absent from the city , was doubtless meant for more than the immediate gratification of Taranis ; it gave him an advantage . Frequent changes were undesirable , even when the monarch was a political nullity . " And if perchance you do n't win , God forbid , w'y , ' e wo n't last out the day ' imself , " Adminius went on . " Yer lads 'll see ter that . " Shocked before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No legionary will raise a finger against him . That 's an order . " " But , but yer the prefect o ' Rome ! " " The more reason to maintain law . Including this damnable law of Ys . We ca n't have the city fall into disorder . Do n't you see , it 's the keystone of everything I 've worked to build in Armorica . " Gratillonius considered . His mind had become as bleakly bright as the sunbeams . " If I fall , report to Soren Cartagi . He 'll be the effective governor for at least a while . Remind him of the need to continue my policies , for the good of Ys . Give him whatever help he requires . When he can spare you , bring the legionariesto the Duke and put them under his orders . " Anguish asked : " Wot about yerself , sir ? " " Let them burn me and scatter the bones and ashes at sea . That 's what Ys does with her fallen Kings . " And I shall go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold their own rites for me . " Gratillonius stiffened his neck . " Enough , " he said . " I do not plan on getting killed . Forward march ! On the double , soldier . " At Dragon House he donned his centurion 's armor . All twenty-four of his men formed ranks and followed him out High Gate , battle-arrayed . By then word had spread and the streets were aswarm , ababble . Where Processional Way started north out of Aquilonian Way , a squad of marinesformed a line to hold back the crowd . Through the wind , Gratilloniusheard shouted wishes for his victory . That warmed him a trifle . He had much to live for , and live he proposed to do . This challenger would scarcely be another pitiable Hornach , but rather some sturdy rogue prepared to take his chances . Quite possibly he was a barbarian . It would be almost a pleasure to kill a Frank , say . In any case , a fair fight which Gratillonius had not provoked was no butchery . As always , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do so would merely weaken him . The road bent east , under sere hills , and the Wood of the King loomed ahead . The gale had torn off nearly all the leaves that earlier turned it bronze . Now trunks and boughs were winter-gray , though shadows stillp468made a cave of the depths beneath them . Twigs clawed at the sky . Timber creaked . Wind eddied about , wailed and mumbled . Half a dozen more marines had reached the courtyard of the Shield and Hammer . They saluted the King . Tethered nearby stood their horses , and leashed hounds whined impatient . If either contestant fled , he would be hunted down and brought back for the death stroke . Red-robed , Soren emerged from the blood-colored house when an attendantcalled . He had been delayed by no need to equip himself ; his was only to lead the ceremonies , before and after . " In the holy name of Taranis , greeting , King of Ys , " he said . For the sake of Dahut , Bodilis , Rome , Gratillonius bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would understand . " The challenger has chosen his weapons and is prepared , " Soren said . Nothing in his heavy visage bespoke how he wished the combat would go . He was the instrument of Taranis . Turning , he cried : " Come forth , 0 you who would be King of Ys ! " A wiry , long-legged young man stepped from the gloom within , onto the porch and down the stairs . His movements were quick , suggestive of tension , but there was no hesitancy in them . A forked black beard , well trimmed , decorated clear features marred by poor teeth and a scar puckeringthe right cheek to pull that corner of his mouth into the hint of a sneer . From the oufits available he had chosen a nose-guarded helmet , knee-length chainmail coat , thick cross-garters over the breeches to protectcalves , small round shield , long Gallic sword in a sheath , a javelin in his free hand . Plainly , he meant to make the best of agility against a larger opponent . Plainly , too , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gait and clarity in the green eyes . Browned skin gave a clue . This was an outdoorsman , skillful to contrive shelter and sleep soundly on the wildest of nights . He would be dangerous as a panther ; and well he knew it . He approached across the flagstones , peered , and halted . In RedonicaccentedLatin he cried , " Are you the King ? But you 're the centurion ! " And Gratillonius knew him . " Rufinus ! " Rufinus , leader of those Bacaudaewhom the legionaries had driven from their prey on the road to JuliomagusThe young man lifted spear and shield . Laughter whooped from him . " Why , you rascal , you never told me ! I 'd not 've bucked you elsewise . Better to 've asked for a place in your command , hey ? " He sobered , apart from a savage grin . " Too late now , I suppose . Right ? Pity . " " What 's this ? " Soren demanded . " Know you each other ? "  |p469  " We 've met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts . " He 'll withdrawhis challenge if I ask . " " Impossible , as well you remember , " said the Speaker for Taranis . " Let us pray . " Rufinus glided close to Gratillonius . The smile kept flickering as he murmured , " I 'm sorry , centurion , truly I am . You 're a decent sort , I think . But you should 've told me , that night in your tent . " They knelt at the royal oak . Soren signed them both with holy water and invoked the Father God . Wind boomed . A raven flew low overhead . " We go off by ourselves , " Gratillonius said bluntly . Rufinus nodded . " They 've explained . " Side by side , the two men pushed through snickering underbrush to the opening , out of sight from the house , where Gratillonius had killed Hornach and Colconor . Strange that underfoot were rain-sodden leaves and humus ; this earth should be gory red . His mood had not caused him to lose wariness . However , Rufinus attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , " This is too bad . It really is . " " What made you come ? " Gratillonius wondered . Rufinus barked laughter . " I wish I could say a mischievous God , but it was just chance  --  and myself  --  though it did seem , one midnight , moonlighthour , that stag-horned Cernunnos danced His madman 's dance before me , to egg me on . . . . Well , " he proceeded in a level tone , " you roadpounders gave us brethren a nasty setback , you know . Not just our dead and wounded . You hit our spirits in the balls , and we skulked about for a long spell , living more off roots and voles than plunder and , hm , donations . My standing as duke was in danger , not that it meant much any more . Bit by bit , I rallied the boys , we got new recruits , till at last I had the makings of a fresh band . What it needed next  --  you 'll know what I mean  --  what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the news ran this summer , civil war begun again and the Emperormarched off south with his army . I remembered Sicorus . Do you ? My landmaster , who debased my sister till she died whelping his get . " Fury went like lightning over the face and through the voice , and vanishedas swiftly . " We all had things to avenge on Sicorus . The upshot was , one night we came and ringed Maedraeacum manor house in . We let women , children , harmless slaves go out , free ; I told the boys that whoevertouched them in anything but helpfulness would answer to my knife . Then we pushed Sicorus 's overseers in to join him , and set fire to the building . That damaged the loot , of course , but next day we still picked a grand amount of gold and silver from the ashes . "  |p470Rufinus  sighed once more , shrugged , and finished : " My mistake . I reckoned the Empire would be too busy with its own woes for doing much about this . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turns out Emperor Maximus has driven his enemies before him right handily . The Roman  --  the Armorican Duke , is that what they call him ? My fellow duke  --  I reckon he decided he could spare the troops to make an example of us . They scoured the woods for a month or more . Most of my Valiant are dead , the rest are fled . Me , I remembered a centurion who reminded me about wonderful Ys , and decided I 'd scant to lose . So here we are , Gratillonius . " Wind brawled , swirled under armor , made the Wood groan . Gratilloniussaid slowly : " Too late , you thought of asking me for a berth in my service . How could I give you any , after what you did ? " " At Maedraeacum ? " answered pride and reason . " Had I no right to bring Ita 's ghost peace ? Every ghost that Sicorus squeezed out of life ? Has n't Rome made friends of her foes , like you Britons or us Gauls ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man of my hands . And . . . My own Bacaudae may be gone , but I know many more , up and down the valleys and off in the hills . Outlaws ; but they could be useful scouts , messengers , irregular fighters , for a King who showed them a little kind-ness . " Gratillonius realized he must not listen . " Try that if you overcome me , " he said . " But remember that Rome is the Mother of us all . And be gentle to the Nine Queens and  --  and their children . " For the first time , he saw complete calm on Rufinus . It was eerily like the peace he himself had felt this dawn after he and Bodilis made love . The wanderer traced a sign with his spear , in the wind . " I promise , " he said low . Thereupon he dropped into a feline crouch and asked , " Shall we have at it , friend ? " " We must , " said Gratillonius . They circled about the glade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bough , croaked hoarsely ; fallen leaves squelped . Rufinus moved his buckler to and fro while his arm stayed cocked , ready to cast the javelin . Gratillonius kept his big Roman shield in place and squinted across its upper edge , the sword poised in his right hand . Glances met and held fast . It was always a peculiar feeling to look into the eyes of a foeman , not unlike looking into those of a woman in bed , an ultimate intimacy . They stalked , he and Rufinus , each in search of an opening . Now andp471then the Gaul made tentative movements of his spear . Gratillonius remainedstolid . The wind blew . Abruptly Rufinus cast . Immediately he snatched for the sword scabbardedacross his back , and charged . The Roman missile should have sunk its iron head into the Roman shield and hung there , its shaft dragging in the earth . Gratillonius was ready for it . His blade flipped it aside . It spent its malice in a rotten log . Rufinus was upon him . The Gallic sword crashed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His own weapon snaked forward . Rufinus sprang back . Blood from his left thigh darkened that trouser leg . He 's mine , Gratillonius knew . But let it be quick . Let it be merciful . Rufinus gave him a wry grin and , again , circled , alert for a chance to pounce . Man for man , outlaw and centurion should be equal . It was not individual Romans but the Roman army that had broken the Gauls . Rufinus , though , had taken a wound not mortal but deep ; and whatever carnivore skills he had picked up , he was untrained in the science of killing . Gratillonius let him attack , over and over , wear himself down , retreat with more blood running out of him . Two or three times he got through the defense , but the injuries that the hare inflicted on the tortoise were minor slashes . The end came all at once . Gratillonius maneuvered Rufinus up against a thicket , which blocked retreat . Rufinus hewed . By that time the long sword was weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panted , while blood soaked his breeches and footsteps . Gratillonius'sshield stopped another blow . His short , thick blade knocked the weapon from his opponent 's grasp . A moment Rufinus stared , until his laughter cried out . " Good work , soldier ! " He spread his arms , while he swayed on his feet . " Come , what 're you waiting for ? Here I am . " Gratillonius found he could not move . " Come , come , " Rufinus raved . " I 'm ready . I 'd 've done for you if I could . " " Pick up your sword , " Gratillonius heard himself say . Rufinus shook his head . " Oh , no , you do n't , " he crowed . " I bear youno ill will , buddy . You won , fair and square . But be damned if I 'll let youpretend  --  Roman  --  you 're still in a fight . Make your offering . " To Taranis , Who deigned to be Colconor . And Lir had slain Dahilis . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " said Rufinus , feebly now as the loss of blood swept him furtherp472along . He staggered . " I only . . . want you . . . to stop playing games with yourself . . . and whatever Gods are yours , Roman , " He lurched , sank to hands and knees , crouched gasping . Mithras forbade human sacrifice . It was as if Bodilis were suddenly there in the wind and the wet , Bodilis whom Gratillonius would seek back to as soon as he was able . Not losing time in cleaning it , he sheathed his sword . " I can not kill you , helpless , " he said , dimly amazed at his own steadiness . " Nor can I let you lie there . Not if you surrender to me , altogether . Do you understand ? I think I can save you if you 'll declare yourself my prisoner , Rufinus . " " I could have worse masters , " muttered back around the reborn grin . Gratillonius knelt and set about stanching the wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lanarvilis the Queen had held many a private meeting . None was as grim as this . The gale had died away , but seas still crashed against the wall and gate of Ys , spume flying higher than the battlements . Their sound went undergroundishlythrough the whole city , as if earth responded to that anger . Starless dark engulfed heaven , save for what towertop windows glimmeredalone . Lights and luxury in the room where Lanarvilis received her visitor could not really stave off night . Motionless in a high-backed chair , she watched him pace to and fro before her . Flamelight sheened on her russet gown and silver fillet . It flickered within her eyes , making them demonlike , though on her face was only compassion for him . He wore his red robe of office , the talisman of the Sun Wheel hung on his breast  --  so fateful did he think this occasion  --  but had removed his miter on entering the house . In the uneasy illumination , his hair and beard seemed largely gray . " Aye , thus it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came back upholding the bandit . Said he 'd bed him down in the Lodge . Ere I could shake off stupefaction and protest , Gratillonius declared himself winner in the combatand that that sufficed ; no good would come of slaying a captive . Instead , he would give Taranis a hecatomb of beasts , bought out of his own purse . " Lanarvilis nodded . " The Gallicenae have heard that much , of course , " she said softly . " He sent a written account among us  --  written by Bodilis , with whom he stays closeted in the palace , his Roman soldiers standingp473by . They 've brought the Gaul there too . That is all I know thus far . His words to us were few and hard , no matter that Bodilis tried to milden them . " " I 'll give you the rest . " Soren 's feet thudded on the carpet , a drumbeat above the sea-noise . " I shouted my outrage . Ys lives by Her Gods , Who require Their ancient sacrifices . He replied that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yield must take their hazard of death ; but he would not believe the honor of any God was served by  --  he called it murder ! " Soren struggled for breath . " Stand aside , ' he said , and began to help the scoundrel to the house . " I called on the marines to kill the challenger , since this traitor King would not . Be still , ' Gratillonius said  --  oh , how quietly . It is not meet that anybody die here . ' His Romans trod closer , hands on hilts . Yet IElissa , Lanarvilis  --  I saw it was not they that stayed the marines . Our guards too were shaken , but ' t was the King they would obey , this king who scorns the Gods That raised him up . " Soren ground fist into palm . " I swallowed vomit , though it burned my throat , " he related . " After the injured man was at rest and a Roman  --  not our standby physician for a wounded victor , but a soldier with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gratillonius returned and I sought to reason with him . Whatever his beliefs , I said , surely he could see that this  --  blasphemy , violation of the Pact  --  this would make him hated and undermine all he has done for his Rome . He answered that he thought not . " " I fear he was right , " Lanarvilis said . " Aye , " Soren groaned . " Have you heard ? Late in the day , when that Rufinus was somewhat recovered , Gratillonius brought him to the city . Beforehand , he had sent for heralds and told them to proclaim his intent . Folk were packed along Lir Way . He entered High Gate at the head of his marching men and , and a squadron of our marines , he riding , with Rufinus tethered at his saddlebow  --  Do you understand ? He gave himself a Roman triumph ; and the people cheered ! " " I heard , " Lanarvilis said . " I was not surprised . " " He has won them over . In spite of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , in spite of everything , he 's their dear King Grallon , for whom they 'll take arms against anybody . How long before the Gods take arms against them ? " " Have you thought , Soren , " she asked low , " that we may in truth be at the end of the Age that Brennilis began ? That mayhap Ys is once more offered the cup of youth , and if she will not taste of it must soon grow old and die ? "  |p474He  halted . He stared . " You too ? " he breathed at last . She shook her head . " Nay , my darling . Never would I betray you . But my Sisters and I  --  other than Bodilis , though she laid certain words of wisdom in that letter  --  we had Maldunilis brought back from Sena and spoke together . I knew you would seek me out . " His bulk trembled . " What did you decide ? " " It may be that Gratillonius will satisfy Taranis with his hecatomb . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart . " Lanarvilis shivered likewise . " Wait and see . Taranis did not cast athunderbolt this day . But if the Gods are indeed wrathful  --  Their revengeis often slow , but always cruel . " Soren traced a sign , braced himself , and said , " I 'm concerned that all Ys not suffer because of a single man 's wickedness . Might you Gallicenae curse him , as you did Colconor ? " Lanarvilis made a fending motion . " Nay ! How could we ? He may be mistaken , but evil he is not . A curse without passion behind it can no more fly to its target than an arrow from a stringless bow . " " And anyhow , several of you would refuse . " " The whole Nine would , Soren . " " So be it , " the man said . " Well , Ys has been saddled in the past with Kings about whom something must be done . I mean not those who were . .. simply bestial , like Colconor , for to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation  --  but some who posed a threat to the whole city . We 'll send our agents out through Armorica , bearing gold and promises . Gratillonius will have challenger after challenger , month after month , till one of them cuts him down . " Calm had descended on Lanarvilis . " We guessed that idea would be broached , we Gallicenae , " she said , " and we forbid it . " " What ? " " Some of us love him . But put that aside . We too can lay our hearts on the altar when it must be done . Think , though . You and I are the politic persons , the worldliest among those who serve the Gods . Is it not really Ys we serve , Mother Ys ? " Think what Gratillonius has done and is doing . He has strengthened us , within and without our wall . He has quickened our stagnant trade . He has reconciled the high and the low . He has kept us free . Who else has the least hope of holding Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scoti and the Saxons learned to fear ? Why , his very Mithras is a counterbalance to that Christ Who would take from us our Gods . " Dare you imagine that some filthy barbarian or runaway slave canp475replace him ? I say to you , Soren Cartagi , and if you are honest you will concede it  --  ill shall Ys fare if she loses King Grallon . " Silence followed , apart from the subterranean thunder of Ocean . Finally Soren dragged forth : " I am . . . aware of this . I awaited that response of yours . I have even begun talks with my colleagues . Hannon is bewildered with horror , but I should be able to talk him over , along with the rest . We will not rebel , not conspire , but bide our time . Let the Gods work as They will . " He stood quiet for a space before adding , " Yet we , Their worshippers , can not sit passive . They make us what we are , our unique selves , Ys . How shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done Them ? " " The Nine have thought upon that , " Lanarvilis replied gravely . " We , his wives , know what stubbornness is in Gratillonius . But patience , endurance , that is woman 's weapon . " Therefore we will lay the foundations of the future , that ineluctable morrow when he has fallen and we are done with mourning him . We will take triple care that our daughters grow up in the awe of the Gods . First and foremost will we instill devoutness in Dahut , child of Dahilis , whose nurturing we share . Forsquilis senses fate within that girl . Its form is unknown , but its power waxes year after year . We Nine will set upon her brow the sigil of the Three . " Again Soren signed himself . " It is well , " he said , took up the wine cups that stood on the table . handed Lanarvilis one and took a long draught from its mate . Thereafter , soothed a little , he sat down opposite her , ventured a smile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Thank you . " She smiled back . " Nay , you let it off yourself . " " Well , mayhap , but first you loosened the bonds holding it fast . Ever have you been kind to me . " " How could I be aught else . . . to you ? " she whispered . They withdrew from the edge of that . " Well , " he suggested , " can we spend a while talking of small things ? How have you fared since last I saw you ? What will you share with me ? " " All I am permitted to , " she said.  |p476Winter  's early night had fallen when three Romans entered an alehouse in the Fishtail district . The first was well known there : Adminius , deputy commander of the legionaries . The second had come occasionally , young Budic ; he , who carried a lantern , now blew it out and put it down on a remnant of mosaic . The third was a tall , craggy-boned , middle-aged man , clad in ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front half of his scalp . This taproom had been the atrium of a fine house  --  long ago , before sea level began to rise , driving the wealthy to higher ground and eventually forcing construction of the great wall . Bits of relief sculpture and hints of frescos peered out of soot and grease . Tables and benches on what was mostly a clay floor were rough wood , though themselves time-worn , haggledby generations of idle knives . Tallow candles guttered and dripped on the boards , enough light to see by after a fashion . Shadows curtained every corner , flickered across peeled plaster and thin-scraped membrane stretched over windows , parodied each movement . The stench of burning fat mingled with odors of cooking from the kitchen , of sour wine and worse beer . Withal , it was a rather cheery place . About a dozen fishers , merchant sailors , wherry oarsmen occupied two of the tables . They drank heartily , jested roughly , laughed loudly . A woman sat with one group , teasing them while she sipped what they bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the hallway beyond . He grinned in lazy wise and secured his belt . The rest gave him a ribald cheer . " Did your ram sink that hull for good this eventide ? " shouted someone . " Nay , " he replied , " you know Keban better than that . She 'll soon bob back to surface . Me , I 'm thirsty . Mead , potboy , none of your horse pissp477but good , honest mead ! " He was young , strong , ruddy of close-trimmed beard and queue-braided hair . Adminius and Budic recognized him . " That 's Herun , of the navy , " said the younger soldier in his diffident way , and the deputy whooped , " ' Oy , there , ' Erun , come drink it with us ! " Their companion shook his head . " Poor , forlorn soul , " he murmured in Latin . " Has he no wife , that he couples with a whore ? " Budic flushed . " W-w-we warned you , sir , what kind of place this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A smile . " It 's not as if I did n't recognize the surroundings . " Herun trotted over . " We got a guest ' ere , " Adminius said . " Coren-tinus . " The mariner halted , squinted through the murk , responded slowly : " Aye , now I know him . Every sennight he preaches at the Forum , from the steps of the old Mars temple . What would a Christian priest among us ? " Corentinus smiled again . " Naught to frighten anybody , " he said in Ysan that had become fluent though heavily accented . " I hope to grow better acquainted with folk . These men kindly offered to show me where sailors hang out . After all , I 'm a sailor myself . " " Indeed ? " " Or was . ' T is another kind of sea I ply nowadays . If I pledge not to evangelize , will you let me drink with you ? " A staring , listening stillness had fallen . " ' E 's a right sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sanctimonious , if you take my meaning . Nobody minds Budic or me or most of us soldiers being Christian , so why mind Corentinus ? " Herun recovered himself . " Welcome , " he said , a bit grudgingly . " Shall we sit ? " He joined the three at a separate table . " Only the mead here is fit for aught but swine and Saxons , " he warned , becoming more genial , " but ' t is pretty fair stuff at the price . " The potboy brought a round . Corentinus watered his . " How like you our city ? " Herun asked him . " Oh , dazzling , a whirlpool of wonders , " the chorepiscopus replied " I 've never seen aught to rival it , and I 've been widely about in my time . ' Adminius laughed . He waved a hand around . " This ' ere 's ' ardly an palace , " he said . " Nay , " Corentinus agreed . " But see you , I 've had my fill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of most wealthy homes in Ys anc its hinterland . Beautiful , as I said ; but my flock numbers few , and the poor and lowly . "  |p478  " Get ye no Christians in summer ? " growled a man at an adjacent table . " I 've met ' em aplenty whilst faring to Roman harbors . " " Aye , aye . They attend services . But my true ministry is to Ys . " Corentinuschuckled and shrugged . " Not that my sermons on the steps  --  my rantings , some call them  --  draw large audiences . So I thought I would go forth among ordinary folk and get to know them well enough that , God willing , I can find what words will appeal to them . " Herun frowned . " You 'll find us a tough lot , " he said . " For see you , ' t is by the favor and power of her Gods that Ys lives . Else would the sea overwhelm us . " " God , the true God , He has power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand . " Belay that , lad . You mean well , but I did promise no preaching this night . Can we not just spin yarns ? Or continue whatever else your pleasure is . " " What is yours ? " purred a female voice . They glanced up . The harlot Keban had tidied herself after Herun and come back downstairs . She was pleasant to look upon , in her close-fitting gown over a buxom figure and her deliberately tousled hair . She drooped her eyelids and smiled . " Care for a bit of fun , you ? " she went on in Corentinus 's direction . He shook his head . " Not Tor me , thank you . " She looked about , " Anybody ? . . . Not yet , anyhow ? . . . Well , who 'll buy a girl a drink ? " " Allow me , " said Corentinus , and gestured her to sit beside him on the bench . " Huh ? " muttered from another table . " Keban , do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can seduce him , " she said impudently , and settled down . Corentinus laughed . " Or I you ? We 'll see . What 'll you have ? " " Wine . " She stuck out her tongue at Herun . " Despite what you say ' bout it . " To the pastor : " I 'm surprised . I truly am . I thought somebody like you would hate me . " Again he shook his head . " Nay , " he told her solemnly . " I must hate what you do , but never you , poor child . Tell me , do you never weary of being a thing ? Do you ever think what becomes of old whores ? " She defied him ; forlornness lay underneath : " What else have I got , unless to be a scullion in some household where the master and , and all of them 'll hump me anyway ? " Budic was appalled . " Why , Keban  --  " he began , and stopped . " You 've been sweet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He withered under Corentinus 's sardonic look . The pastor , though ,  |p479merely  declared to the woman : " ' T is never too late for God 's grace , while life remains . Did you choose to accept His mercy , I would for my part undertake to find you a decent situation . In due course , my church may found a home for those who were lost aforetime . " The outer door creaked . Boots thudded under the weight of a bearsolidman , roughly clad , who snuffed the link he had been carrying by scrubbing it against the clay and tossed it down . As he approached through the gloom , first Herun , then the soldiers and most of the marinersrecognized his rocky visage . " Maeloch ! " cried one . " What brings ye hither ? " The fisher captain spouted a laugh . " What d'ye think ? A bumper of mead , and  --  Ah , two girls on hand , I see . Hoy , Keban , Sills , which of ye 'd fain be first ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwontedly silent , but the second , merry , asked , " What , are you that well-heeled tonight , Maeloch ? " " Aye , and horny as a narwhal , " he said , striding close to rumple her locks . " Been outside o ' town this past month , helping Kadrach the cooper . " No boats like his , and few ships , put far out to sea at this time of year . Maeloch sobered . " And now I 'm done , well , looks to me like a spell o ' calm weather ahead , after the blows and high seas we 've been getting . Belike there 'll soon be a summons for the Ferriers . I 'll enjoy myself here , for I 'd better be home tomorrow night . " Mirth had retreated as he spoke . Several men drew signs . " Lackwits ! " Maeloch said amiably . " Why shrink ye when I bespeak yon duty ? Would ye liefer the ghosts spooked about ashore , for aye ? " Since other benches were crowded , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Keban , and Corentinus . He peered past sputtering candles . " But ye be the Christian priest ! " he exclaimed . " Not precisely my title , " the chorepiscopus replied . " No matter . I 've heard talk of you , if I mistake me not . " He offered his hand across the board , for a clasp in the manner of Ysans who were equals . Maeloch ignored it , scowled , said harshly , " Why d'ye pester honest men at their hard-won ease ? " " My son , I came not to pester , only to make acquaintance . And ever since I heard of your strange task , I 've wished to talk with one among those who do it . Somehow the chance has not come . " " Nor likely will . " Maeloch grabbed his mead from the servant and swilled deep . " We be no puking preachers , we be plain working men , but this duty we have from our fathers , ' t is holy , and we 'll not speak of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd mock it . "  |p480  " Oh , but I would never mock , " said Corentinus quietly . " You have right , ' t is far too sacred a matter . I wish to understand what happens on those nights . " " That ye may scuttle it ? " fleered Maeloch . He drank more , snorted , grinned . " Enough . I seek no fight . Keban , honey , are ye ready to frig ? " The woman looked downward . " I do n't  --  sudden-like , I do n't feel so well , " she mumbled . " I 'm sorry , but could I just sit a while ? " Maeloch stiffened . " Next to the priest ? What 's he been feeding ye ? " " Let her be , " Corentinus snapped . " Yonder 's a wanton for you . " His tone sharpened . " Or is it unthinkable you seek the wife that I suppose you have ? " Rage flared . " What business of yours , shavehead ? I 've heard ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennilis , in the Forum ; and I 've heard the sea growl in answer at the gate . No more ! Get out ! " " Now , wait a bit , " Adminius urged . Maeloch scrambled to his feet and around the table , to stand behind Corentinus and ask , " D'ye leave on your own shanks , or do I frog march ye forth ? Quick ! " Corentinus rose , stepped over the bench , looked down an inch or two into the malachite eyes ? " Are you that afraid of me ? " he murmured . Maeloch snarled and seized the right wrist of Corentinus . Instantly , the pastor jerked between thumb and forefinger and freed himself ; and somethinghappened with an ankle and a shove ; and Maeloch sprawled on the floor . Men swarmed up and around . " No brawl , hoy , let 's ha ' no brawl ! " " God forbid , " said Corentinus mildly . As the fisher climbed back up : " Maeloch , friend , I know you 're awearied , overwrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my intent . I humbly beg your forgiveness . May I stand you a drink ? " What could a sailor do but accept ? A fresh beaker , drained , had him asking where a priest had learned such a trick for a tussle . " Well , that 's a bit of a story , " Corentinus said . " Care to hear ? Later I 'll be happy to teach you the art , if you like . " Men crowded around . Corentinus leaned back , laid ankle over knee , and began : " ' T was from a Sarmatian , on the south coast of the Suebian Sea , back when I was a deckhand . He was a wanderer himself , an outrunnerof those Sclavonic and other tribes that 're pushing in , now when the Goths and their kindred have pulled out . My ship was adventuring in hopes of getting amber at the source , ' stead of overland . First , you may know , we had to round the Cimbrian Chersonese and pass through the straits to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jutii ,  |p481Dani  , not really German although they claim the royal houses of the German tribes stem from them ; and they have some mightily curious customs  --  " Keban , too , listened . Silis sat apart ; she had no interest in geography . One hand cradled her cheek , the fingernails of the other drummed the table . Merowech the Frank and his grown sons had been in Condate Redonum buying slaves . They did this four times a year  --  a healthy young male shortly before equinox and solstice . Everybody in the city knew why ; nobody dared speak about it . A few times the Roman authorities had , in private talks , offered to supply condemned criminals free . The Frankish headmen spurned it . They would give their Gods nothing but the best . Merowech always obtained the victim , using money collected from the laeti , because the sacred grove stood on his land . It was he who speared the naked body that sprattled strangling from a rope flung over a bough . ( The corpse was left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stacked on that hill where the midsummer bonfire burned . ) To other leading men of the neighborhood fell the honor of poleaxing and bleeding the animals that were also sacrificed , drinking some of the blood and sprinkling the worshippers with the rest . Afterward the carcasses went to Merowech 's cookhouse , and everybody feasted in his hall . Thus nourished , Wotan and His sky-riding war band ought to grant victory in battle . For the vernal equinox an additional purchase was required , a young woman . While the slain kine roasted , the men took her to a newly plowed field nearby . There Merowech swived her , followed by as many more as wished to call Fricca 's blessing on their crops and their wives . She then went to work for the household whose turn it was , if she survived . Often she did not . This day was glorious . Throughout the forest , buds had swelled and burst into leaf , blossom , a tumble of tender colors leading off toward reaches where sunlight speckled shadowiness , a whispering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser birds jubilated . Overhead passed the great migrators , homeward bound . Regardless , Merowech , Fredegond , Childeric , and Theuderich rode in helmets and ringmail , weapons at hand . Their dignity demanded it .
