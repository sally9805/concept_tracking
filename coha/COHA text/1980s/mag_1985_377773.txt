When Stanley Watras , a Bechtel Group engineer assigned to the Limerick nuclear-power plant in Boyertown , Pa. , set off radiation monitors last winter , that in itself was unusual . Nuclear-plant workers rarely come into contact with radioactive substances during their daily routine . What disturbed Watras even more was that he tripped the detectors not while he was leaving the nuclear complex but when he was entering it . As a result , he requested that Limerick 's owner , Philadelphia Electric Co . ( PECO ) , check radiation levels at his house in Colebrookdale , Pa. , a few miles from the plant . <P> Five days later , PECO technicians took air samples at the Watras home and discovered extraordinary concentrations of radon , a radioactive gaseous element that can cause cancer . The technicians were so startled by their finding that they ran their test a second time . The result was the same : the samples showed the house contained what turned out to be the highest concentration of the colorless , odorless , tasteless gas ever found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in the radon-tainted environment for one year , Watras , 34 , and his wife Diane , 33 , had been exposed to the equivalent of 455,000 chest X rays , which increased their risk of contracting lung cancer by 13% to 14% . The Watrases immediately vacated the house . Two weeks ago , after the completion of a $32,000 PECO-sponsored cleanup operation , they moved back . <P> Stunned by the discovery , the bureau of radiation safety at the Pennsylvania environmental resources department dispatched half of its 25-person staff to the Boyertown area , where during the past five months they have tested 1,800 local dwellings for radon . Their finding : 40% of the homes have unacceptably high levels of the gas . Says Kay Jones , 40 , who lives with her husband Richard and their children in a contaminated house across the street from the Watras ' : " Where am I going to go ? Our life savings are in our home . " <P> The problem , however , extends far beyond Boyertown . Says Bruce Dallas , spokesman for the environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the iceberg in terms of impact . Radon could be anywhere . " The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a million American homes may be contaminated , and in May a federal interagency task force reported that indoor radon exposure may cause as many as 30,000 deaths from lung cancer in the U.S. every year . <P> Discovered in 1900 , radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium , which in turn is a product of the radioactive breakdown of uranium . The gas has long been recognized as a health threat to uranium miners , who suffer abnormally high rates of lung cancer . But as a gas , radon can flow for miles underground , often rising to the surface through faults and porous rock far from any source of uranium . In fact , the Watras house is located in a region called the Reading Prong , from which larger-than-normal quantities of radon rise . The region stretches from Reading , Pa. , eastward across northern New Jersey and into New York State , High levels of indoor radon have also been found in Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Carolinas , Georgia , Texas , California and Washington State .
