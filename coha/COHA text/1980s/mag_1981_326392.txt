" Billyball " is winning games and drawing fans for the A 's <P> When Billy Martin 's Oakland A 's climbed from last place in 1979 to second in the American League West last year , critics insisted that Martin 's magic could not last . He was , after all , using mirrors- often platooning eight mediocre players , for instance-to create the illusion of an infield . Certainly Oakland 's starting pitchers were impressive , setting a modern record by completing 94 games in 1980 . But , it was argued , the strong arms would weaken with overwork . In any event , the league was wise to the wiles of Billyball , as Martin 's harumscarum tactics became known . Surely no catcher would fall for the double steal in 1981 after being burned so often last year , and of course pitchers were now alert for the attempted steal of home , the hit-and-run , the ubiquitous bunt and other hallmarks . <P> With the new season just 2 weeks old , the A 's have delivered an emphatic answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Oakland won its first eleven games , breaking the ten-game record held by three teams . Throughout that remarkable span , the A 's starting pitchers completed all but one game and compiled a miserly 1.27 earned run average . At week 's end Oakland had won 15 of 16 games , opening a full ten-game lead over the defending champion Kansas City Royals . <P> As for Billyball , it was still leaving opponents faked out of their flannels . On opening day , the A 's choked off a Minnesota Twins rally with the ultimate schoolyard sucker-play-the old hidden-ball trick . Martin 's merry men helped mount the season 's first major brawl , a bench-emptier with Seattle during Oakland 's record-setting eleventh win . There is even a shortstop , Mack " Shooty " Babitt , who sprints to first base when he draws a walk and , occasionally , slides in . <P> Martin 's most remarkable achievement has been to infuse his pitching staff with the skill and confidence to become winners . Under his goading and the tutelage of Pitching Coach Art Fowler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong young arms suddenly became awesome . In 1979 none of the five starters won more than a dozen games or had an earned run average below 4.22 . Last year they had the league 's top team ERA and Ace Mike Norris ( 22-9 ) finished second to Baltimore 's Steve Stone in Cy Young balloting . Look at them now : Norris , 4 wins , 0 losses , 1.64 ERA ; Rick Langford , 2-1 , 3.00 ; Steve McCatty , 3-0,1.28 ; Brian Kingman , 2-0 , 0.82 ; Matt Keogh , 3-0 , 0.33 . So far this year , Oakland 's relief pitchers are the most underemployed crew in baseball . In the first 16 games , they worked a grand total of 7 ? innings . Says Righthander Jeff Jones of life in the bullpen : " We eat a lot of sunflower seeds . "
