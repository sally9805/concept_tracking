Wolves roam through our racial memory , howling beyond the firelight , scaring the hell out of us . But they no longer roam in Yellowstone National Park , except as rare transients , prowling south from Canada . The last resident wolves in the big park were exterminated by Government hunters by the late 1920s . That was a time when animals were thought to be good ( elk and bison , for instance ) or bad . Wolves had been pursued in the West as if they were not merely bad , but evil . Cattlemen lost entire herds to harsh winters , then spent enormous , irrationally large sums of money taking vengeance on wolves . Barry Lopez , in his haunting book Of Wolves and Men , tells of wolves drenched with gasoline and set afire , wolves pulled apart by horses . You ca n't dismember an April blizzard . <P> Should the gray wolf , today an endangered species in most of the U.S. , be re-established in Yellowstone ? An old stockman at a meeting at Laramie , Wyo. , shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reintroducing smallpox . But to wolf partisans , the bedrock argument is a brooding , circular truth : without wolves , there are no wolves . These complex , mysterious animals are their own justification . Beyond that , biologists see predators as balance wheels in ecosystems . No wolves mean too many elk , which is what Yellowstone has now , starving by the thousands in winter die-offs . <P> Yellowstone can seem grand and wild , or it can resemble a big , hokey theme park , an example of what happens when man meddles too much with nature . Policies shift with political winds , and under former National Park Service director William Penn Mott , a wolf enthusiast , Yellowstone officials pushed hard for the wolf 's reintroduction . Now Mott has been replaced by fence-sitter James Ridenour , and political pressure is reaching Yellowstone . Two weeks ago , a traveling Park Service slide show on wolf reintroduction was canceled . An elaborate study asked for by Congress seems certain , when it is released at year 's end , to recommend the return of wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary environmental-impact statement . The major national environmental groups support wolf reintroduction , and one , the Defenders of Wildlife , is raising $100,000 to reimburse stockmen in the northern Rockies for livestock the wolves might kill . Last month Defenders agreed to pay $1,700 to cattlemen for kills by a wolf pack that had migrated from Canada into Montana . <P> Natural migration probably can not restock Yellowstone , which is why the political jostling goes on . Big , burly Dave Mech , widely accepted as the world 's leading authority on wolves , says Yellowstone is ideal for Canis lupus . Alston Chase , the cantankerous philosopher who wrote Playing God in Yellowstone , thinks the U.S. has a moral obligation to return wolves to the park . But the wolves ' most effective ally may be Renee Askins , 30 , of Moose , Wyo. , a wildlife ecologist who stumps for an advocacy group she founded called the Wolf Fund .
