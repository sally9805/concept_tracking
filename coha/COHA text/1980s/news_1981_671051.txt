And so the Bills , not the Jets , will be in Cincinnati next Sunday as the Super Bowl playoffs continue . But for followers of the Jets , the outcome should not diminish what occurred at Shea Stadium . For more than two decades , the Baltimore Colts ' 23-17 overtime victory against the Giants for the 1958 National Football League championship had been billed as the greatest football game ever played . But for sustained theater , yesterday ' s was better. // The game was what the N.F.L. is all about - two quality teams snarling and slashing for 60 minutes , beginning with the opening kickoff , on which Bruce Harper fumbled and the Bills had a 7-0 lead after only 16 seconds. // In the end , those 7 gift points made the difference . Those points stunned the Jets into a stupor that contributed to the Bills ' 24-0 lead . Those points will haunt the Jets until they report to training camp in July , but at his locker Bruce Harper discussed those points with the clinical detachment of a surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even know how it happened , " he was saying . " I really don ' t know . " Just then one of the reporters around him dropped a pen. // " Like that , " Bruce Harper said , smiling . " It happened just as quick as that . " Ervin Parker , a Bills linebacker , had tackled Bruce Harper , and the loose ball took one bounce and hopped up into the hands of the cornerback Charles Romes , who dashed untouched 26 yards for one of the quickest touchdowns in N.F.L. postseason history. // " I ' ve fumbled a kickoff before , " Bruce Harper was saying now . " But nobody ever ran one in on me before. " // Bruce Harper acknowledged that he had been stunned by the quick touchdown , as all the Jets had . But then he talked about how " I just forgot about it ; I ' ve returned enough kickoffs not to worry about one fumble , even if they did run it in - not to let something like that mess my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten about it . But in the next few months he ' ll remember it . Often. // " That touchdown on the kickoff took the wind out of our sails , " the defensive tackle Marty Lyons had said earlier . " But no one man cost us the game . We lost as a team. " // As a team , the Jets simply made too many mistakes . That was their problem early in the season , when they plodded to an 0-3 start , and yesterday they had that same problem . Other than Bruce Harper ' s fumble , their most obvious mistake was Wesley Walker ' s failure to catch what would have been a 42-yard touchdown pass when the Bills had a 7-0 lead. // " I lost it in the lights , " he said . " I didn ' t really see the ball . " Wesley Walker later dropped another pass that , had he caught it , might have put the Jets in position to narrow the Bills ' 14-0 lead . " His hand was across my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s an easy catch . " Wesley Walker would catch three of Richard Todd ' s passes for 24 yards . But the two he didn ' t catch will haunt him now , those two that would have put the Jets back in the game quickly. // " Got to be able to depend on me , " Wesley Walker was saying now . " I couldn ' t come through . " With the game on the line in the closing seconds , Richard Todd couldn ' t quite come through , either . But that should not detract from what he had almost accomplished . It ' s one thing for a quarterback to complete passes when his team is ahead or in a tight game . It ' s quite another to complete 28 of 51 passes for 377 yards when his team is behind and the opposing defense knows that he ' s going to be throwing on almost every play. // " It was a great comeback , " Richard Todd was saying now , his bruised left shoulder in a sling , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t finish it. " // The Jets weren ' t able to finish it because the Bills ' defense made the big play when it had to be made - the interception by Bill Simpson , the free safety , at the 1-yard line. // " I didn ' t see Simpson until he caught the ball , " Richard Todd said . " If I had , I wouldn ' t have thrown it. " // The big play . In the Jets ' 10-2-1 record over the last 13 games , the defense had prevented the big play , except for the 57-yard touchdown pass from David Kreig to Steve Largent that gave the Seattle Seahawks a 27-23 victory three weeks ago . But yesterday the Jets were stung by two big plays - Joe Ferguson ' s 50-yard touchdown pass to Frank Lewis and Joe Cribbs ' s 45-yard touchdown run. // On defense , the Bills also made big plays that twice forced the Jets to settle for a field goal instead of a touchdown . Of a possible 14 points in those two situations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , was the key . In the second situation , they had third-and-goal at the 1-yard line midway in the third quarter with the Bills ahead , 24-10 . Then Richard Todd was pounced upon by Mike Kadish and Mike Humiston at the 2. // " We were going to go for the touchdown on fourth down if we hadn ' t lost that yard , " Coach Walt Michaels said later . " In that situation , 2 yards is a lot more than 1 yard. " // " They played it well , " Richard Todd said of the sack on that play . " You can second-guess everything . I ' m not going to secondguess anybody for sending in that play. " // Not far away , a blue wooden stage with a beige curtain was empty . That was the platform where the Jets were to have been interviewed on TV if they had won . But they lost . Between them , the Jets and the Bills played one of the best games in N.F.L. history , but the Jets didn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mike Hickey , the director of player personnel , " it ' s never a great game . " Not true . But only the Buffalo Bills appreciate it . Only in Buffalo will it be remembered for what it was. //
