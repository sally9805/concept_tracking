ON JANUARY 28 , 1981 , after less than a week in office . President Ronald Reagan announced that he was bringing an immediate end to the price controls that had governed American oil for almost ten years , speeding up a process already set in motion by President Carter . With that simple act , the energy crisis of the 1970s ended . You would have hardly known it from reading the newspapers . Reporters , making their rounds of the usual reliable sources , asked only one constituency consumer groups ? what they thought of the decision . The consumer groups put up their usual howl , complaining that it would only mean higher prices . Thus the Associated Press report of the story , the next day , began like this : WASHINGTON ( AP ) ? American motorists can expect to pay even more at the gasoline pumps in the next few days as a result of President Reagan 's first major economic decision . Reagan is making good on a campaign promise to remove immediately the remaining price and allocation controls on petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rise by 8 to 12 cents per gallon over the next few weeks as a result of the decision . There was not the slightest suggestion of what the long-term effects of the decision might be . Nor has there been since except for a few scattered editorials in the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times . So the news is told . When President Reagan asked for a review of the situation this summer , his advisers told him that the decision to scrap price controls had effectively ended the energy traumas of the 1970s . Consumption was declining , domestic drilling was skyrocketing , imports were down , and OPEC was starting to fall apart . His response was reported to be : " Why does n't anybody tell me these things ? " It was a legitimate question . Apart from a few economists , probably no more than a handful of people have yet realized that the current collapse of world oil prices is the direct result of the American people 's decision finally to face reality . We have already swallowed the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody has even realized it yet . L ET US TAKE a look at what has happened since President Reagan decided last January to accelerate President Carter 's 1979 decision to remove oil price controls by fall 1981 , and thus to end , with one stroke , the long-drawn-out attempt to protect consumers from reality . For a few weeks , oil prices did rise , just as consumer groups had predicted . Within a month , gas prices at the pump had climbed by about ten cents a gallon . Heating oil also went up by about the same amount . Domestic oil prices , freed from constraints that had kept them at about twenty-nine dollars a barrel , quickly jumped to around thirty-six dollars a barrel ? a change that should have reflected a rise of about fourteen cents at the pump . It looked as if consumers might be in for a rough time . But then strange things started to happen . As late as December 1980 , the Department of Energy had been predicting that world oil supplies would remain tight " indefinitely , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the range of $45-50 per barrel . But by March the major oil companies suddenly found themselves with growing inventories on their hands . By May , refineries had a 20 percent oversupply of oil products , and were starting to worry about storage problems . They did the only sensible thing . They started to cut prices . By the end of May , heating-oil prices were down throughout the country by four or five cents . Gas prices at the pump fell below their January levels . The national average of gasoline prices across the country fell to its lowest level in two years . Sporadic price wars broke out in various areas . By midsummer , competition between two service stations in Cincinnati had lowered the price of gasoline to seventy-three cents per gallon at one point , and cars were once again lining up outside filling stations ? this time to buy the new cheap gas . Before very long , these events started to have repercussions on the world market . By early summer , every major OPEC nation found itself with growing stockpiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost 60 percent of its customers between April and August because it refused to lower its prices . Nigeria also had large surpluses . OPEC production as a whole has now fallen 30 percent since 1979 . What happened in Mexico was tragicomic . In June , the nation found itself unable to sell its oil at the premium price of forty dollars a barrel anymore . The minister for oil , Jorge Diaz Serrano , faced with a collapsing market , lowered the price of Mexican oil by four dollars . Mexican public opinion , however , accustomed to high prices , was outraged at the decision and demanded that the old price be restored . Jorge Diaz Serrano , till then considered the favorite to succeed Lopez Portillo to the presidency next year , was forced to resign from office , his political career ruined . But the oil still could not be sold at $40 a barrel , and subsequent oil ministers have now lowered the price by $3.90 ? holding back the last ten cents apparently in an effort to avoid Jorge Diaz Serrano 's fate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the oil glut by pumping 10 million barrels of oil a day instead of its previous 8 million , in order to " discipline " other OPEC members and end up with a uniform price of around thirty-four dollars a barrel . Yet many observers are skeptical of this interpretation . They point out that Saudi Arabia has already committed most of its oil revenues , and with prices falling , will not find it easy to cut back to production of 8 million barrels a day again . In any case . OPEC 's attempts at an emergency August meeting to reach agreement on a price , and regain " control " of the market , were a failure . Not only were the members unable to compromise on a unified price of $34-36 a barrel , but their subsequent actions showed that the OPEC countries themselves are now at the mercy of the market . Two days after the meeting fell apart , Nigeria voluntarily lowered its oil price from $40 to $36 per barrel . It was the largest price reduction an OPEC nation has ever imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit bottom yet . The golden age of OPEC is over . How did this sudden reversal occur ? There are many reasons , but the crucial one ? both for its timing and its effect ? is the Reagan administration 's decision last January to end price control . It is now possible to examine the related upheavals of the 1970s and put them in perspective . The oil crisis was nothing more than a self-inflicted wound . With the exception of five months in 1973-74 when the Arab states stopped sending oil to the West in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel , no event of the 1970s that we labeled under the rubric of " the oil crisis " was anything more than America 's refusal to pay the proper price for its own oil . It was certainly not an oil-company plot or a sign that we were " running out of resources . " Oil was the only commodity in the entire economy that was never freed from President Nixon 's temporary wage and price controls imposed in 1971 . This created an inevitable gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by importing snore oil , leaving us vulnerable to all the foreign shocks and international intrigues that followed . Here is the way it happened . Dependence on foreign oil T HE BEGINNING of the oil crisis of the 1970s can be traced to 1968 and the first stirrings of the environmental movement . At the time , though few people remember it , the country was operating under the Oil Import Quota system set up by President Eisenhower in 1959 . The policy limited the country 's imports to no more than 12 percent of its total consumption . It was honored more in the breach than the observance , however , and imports actually hovered around 19 percent throughout the 1960s . The original rationale for the quota system was national security . It was argued that if we became too dependent on foreign sources for such an important commodity as oil , we might become vulnerable to cutoffs in time of war or national emergency . The effect of the program , on the other hand , was to give some protection to the small domestic oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are not the oil giants like Exxon , Gulf , Texaco , and the rest of the Seven Sisters . They are the hundreds and hundreds of entrepreneurs who live off small and medium-sized oil holdings ? and produce about 60 percent of our own oil . A great deal of the confusion that existed in the early years of the 1970s arose from the failure to distinguish between these small companies and the giants . The import quotas protected the small companies from the dirt-cheap competition in the Middle East , where oil could be pumped out of the ground for less than ten cents a barrel . Domestic oil was selling at about $1.90 a barrel in 1969 . But even with the import quotas , the price to consumers had been steadily falling over the previous twenty years . The oil giants , on the other hand , were slightly hampered by the import quotas , although they never made too much fuss about it . They were prevented from importing great quantities from the Middle East , but , on the other hand , were afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by selling Middle Eastern oil to Europe , and did not press much for abolition of the U.S. import restrictions . The trouble began when environmental groups decided that newly discovered low-sulfur oils in North Africa and Indonesia were just what was needed to clean up air pollution . Before Lyndon Johnson left office , environmental groups in California and New York had wrung concessions out of Interior Secretary Stewart Udall ( who administered the quota program ) to allow more cheap , low-sulfur crudes to be imported from Libya and Southeast Asia as a substitute for coal in utility boilers . A number of incentives were introduced , and imports began to rise . . Then an odd thing happened . Consumer groups , suddenly aware of all the cheap oil being pumped around the world , began to argue that scrapping the import quotas would produce a consumer bonanza as well . In 1970 , Ralph Nader 's task force on air pollution ( one of the first incarnations of " Nader 's Raiders " ) published a book called Vanishing Air , which questioned the " national-security " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would solve both environmental and consumer problems . They suggested that the quotas were a " protectionist wall " that " creates a domestic price for petroleum substantially in excess of the world price . " It was " estimated to cost American consumers five to eight billion dollars a year . " After the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969 created new concerns about offshore drilling , the environmentalists ' urgings to lift the import quotas became much louder . In 1972 the Sierra Club published a book on coal strip-mining called Stripping , which concluded that scrapping the import quotas would cut down on strip-mining , reduce offshore drilling , clean the air , and solve just about every other environmental difficulty . Criticizing a decision of the Nixon administration not to give up the quotas , the author , John F. Stacks , wrote : The scrapping of the import quota task force recommendation to abolish that system will pile more costs onto the consumer , who has already paid more than $30 billion to subsidize the oil industry through quotas and tax giveaways . Soon the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental circles . NNOTICED , however , was that the real turning point in America 's energy situation had already passed . In 1970 , our domestic oil production peaked at 9.6 million barrels a day , after a century of steady increases . We had run out of " easy oil . " Older wells were playing out , and all the new oil lay in environmentally troublesome areas offshore , in Alaska , and in deeper , unexplored regions of the earth 's crust . Americans faced a difficult choice . Either we had to accept a steep rise in American oil prices , to pay for the higher costs of drilling and encourage wiser use , or we had to open our doors to more imported oil . For a long while the Nixon administration resisted making a decision . Task forces were assigned to the problem , and most of them came back with the recommendation that we might as well import more oil . Nixon personally resisted the idea , however . He was still impressed with the national-security argument , and leery of making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this position was obviated by a decision in August 1971 to impose an across-the-board temporary wage and price freeze . The controls had an enormous impact on the oil market . Prices should have been climbing rapidly . Production from old wells was leveling off and the development of new sources was proving expensive . A clear signal was needed to tell consumers that the time had come to start conserving . Instead , the price controls seriously distorted the situation . The artificially low price of domestic oil discouraged expensive new exploration . But it also allowed consumers to go on guzzling oil as if nothing had happened . Consumption rose in 1971-73 at 4 percent per year ? a straight-line projection from the old days of falling prices in the 1960s . Nobody noticed that domestic oil was harder to find . And so , in order to make up for this growing gap between domestic supply and demand , we turned to the solution that was to become the characteristic pattern of the entire decade . We imported more oil . The holes that the environmental movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All sorts of incentives had been set up allowing refiners bonus quantities of imported crude if they cleaned it of sulfur . The program was easily manipulated so that imported crudes became the stock for other uses as well . By 1973 we were importing close to 30 percent of our oil , an unprecedented foreign dependence . By the time the quotas were scrapped , they were useless anyway . Without even noticing it , we were at the mercy of world events . The reason for shortages HE INEVITABILITY of price controls for the benefit of consumers creating shortages of goods is a cardinal point understood by nearly all economists and only a handful of members of the public . I have searched for a metaphor for this phe-nomenon. and finally found one in an expe-rience a friend of mine had in the Peace Corps . He and his colleagues were trying to teach Indian village women the rhythm meth-od of birth control by giving them a string of thirty beads that represented the days of their menstrual cycle . The eight days representing their fertile period were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each day they were to move one bead , refraining from intercourse on the red days . After a while , however , they found the system did n't work . When the dangerous days of the month arrived , the women would simply move all the red beads across the string at once . They assumed that this act of magic would prevent them from getting pregnant . We do the same thing with prices . The market price of a commodity is nothing more than a reflection of its scarcity relative to its demand . When goods become harder to obtain , the price goes up . But we assume that by artificially lowering the price ? asking the government to intervene with price controls , that is ? we can make a good less scarce . Instead , the opposite results . With prices artificially low , consumers try to buy more of the commodity , while suppliers reduce production because they can not recover their costs . The result is an artificial shortage , where goods are scarcer than at the beginning . Our confusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we hoped to avoid . As President Nixon 's 1971 price freeze remained in place , the American economy became increasingly characterized by a series of surpluses and shortages . With prices held at rigid , artificial levels , the gaps between supply and demand became unavoidable . By 1973 , steel , concrete , aluminum , and dozens of other basic commodities were becoming unobtainable on the market . The situation coincided with the Club of Rome 's jeremiads and the popular conception that we were quickly hitting the bottom of the barrel on resources . Newsweek ran a cover story showing Uncle Sam holding up an empty horn of plenty under the caption RUNNING OUT OF EVERYTHING ? Apparently , nobody at Newsweek realized that we were only experiencing the inevitable results of price controls ( no one , that is , except Milton Friedman , who continually pointed it out in his columns ) . But by the middle of 1973 the price controls had been phased out , and these shortages quickly solved themselves . Oil , however , was an exception . So much pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress became afraid to let the market go where it would . It was obvious that the days of twenty-five cents a gallon for gasoline were over . Yet Congress shunned the cure for America 's falling domestic production . Oil became the only exception to the general abandonment of price controls ; protection was extended through 1975 . M EANWHILE , barely noticed events in the Middle East were beginning to indicate that " cheap foreign oil " was n't going to remain cheap for very long . In 1969 , a colonels ' revolt in Libya overthrew the pro-Western monarchy . The new military regime , under Colonel Muammer Qaddafi , soon realized it was supplying both Europe and America with low-sulfur oil that could hardly be matched anywhere else in the world . In 1970 , the new government imposed a twenty-cent price increase on its concessionaires . The oil companies fussed and fumed , but soon realized that there were no American Marines or strategists for the Central Intelligence Agency waiting in the wings to correct the problem . ( In the last such incident , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , the attempt by Mohammed Mossadegh to nationalize Iran 's oil concessions and impose a price increase on Western consumers had resulted in a coup masterminded by the CIA , and the installation of the shah . On the eve of the Arab oil boycott , President Nixon was still publicly reminding the Middle Eastern states to beware the " lesson of Mossadegh . " ) Finally , the oil companies accepted the price increase ; they had no choice . Soon a moribund debating society , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , founded in 1960 at the instigation of Venezuelan oil minister Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso , was meeting in earnest in Vienna . By September 1973 . OPEC members were presenting a solid front to the oil companies and negotiating for an across-the-board price increase of fifty-three cents to match Libya 's efforts . The oil companies protested and said it was impossible . In truth , though , they were n't sure . When the negotiations finally broke down , Sheikh Yamani , the Saudi Arabian OPEC minister , said that the producing nations might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while American consumers remained oblivious . Blinded by the continuing price controls , we went on guzzling gas in ever greater amounts as if nothing had happened . Few people were aware that we were importing any of our oil , let alone 30 percent . British journalist Anthony Sampson , whose book The Seven Sisters describes the events leading up to the boycott , says that an " air of unreality " began to enshroud those American businessmen and politicians who could actually see what was happening . In 1972 we set an all-time record for oil consumption , and were headed for another in 1973 . When several oil companies formed a delegation to try to warn Nixon administration officials of 32 the growing restiveness in the producing countries , they were politely ignored . On the day Sheikh Yamani and the OPEC ministers broke off negotiations with American oil firms in October 1973 , no American newspaper carried the story . w HAT HAPPENED next , of course , is history . The Arabs realized their growing market leverage and exercised it in the oil boycott during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption was the first of the " gas shortages . " But the boycott was over by March , and gas lines ended well before that . Far more important was that the producing nations ? to their surprise ? found they had a stranglehold on the Western oil market . They quickly raised prices to seven times their 1970 levels , setting in motion what was later called " the greatest and swiftest transfer of wealth in history . " Over the next year , some $112 billion flowed out of consumers ' pockets and into the coffers of the oil-producing nations . What should we have done ? Obviously , we should have increased domestic production and cut consumption . The formula for this was not really very difficult . Domestic oil price controls were already artificially discouraging production and stimulating consumption . Getting rid of them would have been the easiest step of all . Then , had we been really serious , we could have done what the Europeans and Japanese have done for decades and taxed consumption , particularly consumption of foreign oil . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he began his state-of-the-union address by asking Congress to abolish price controls and impose a two-dollar-a-barrel tax on foreign oil . He promised that reducing imports would be the first priority of the administration . Had the nation been willing to give President Ford a hearing , we might have avoided some of the turmoil that followed . Congress , however , had its own ideas . T HE BATTLEGROUND became the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act ( a political euphemism if ever there was one ) . At first , Congress seemed willing to go along with President Ford 's assessment : foreign dependence was a problem , and price controls were only making things worse . But then a suburban rebellion began in the House of Representatives . Congressmen Andrew Maguire ( N.J. ) , Richard Ottinger ( N.Y. ) , and Toby Moffett ( Conn. liberal Democrats representing the three wealthiest suburban counties in the New York area ? began a campaign to extend oil price controls . Joined by figures such as Edward Kennedy ( Dem. - Mass . ) , Howard Metzenbaum ( Dem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , and Henry Jackson ( Dem. - Wash. ) in the Senate , these legislators eventually succeeded in getting through a decision to extend price controls all the way through 1979 and possibly beyond . Not only that , the Energy Research and Development Administration was instructed to lower the price of domestic oil in February 1976 in order to punish the oil companies . It was Congress 's election-year present to the nation for 1976 . It worked well . Large Democratic major ? ities were returned to Congress at the end of the year , with a new Democratic president to lead them . Consumers were already celebrating by surging back to big cars , and guzzling gas again as if the boycott had never happened . Everything seemed fine . Yet the oil price controls remained a time bomb ticking away in the American economy . It finally exploded in 1979. and perhaps helped to carry away the Democratic administration with it . OPEC 's short . happy life EW PEOPLE seem to realize that OPEC 's monopoly of the market lasted only about three years . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . From 1974 to 1977 , the relatively few oil-producing countries probably could have charged any price they wanted to Western consumers . Europe , in particular , had long been accustomed to easy access to Middle Eastern oil . and had few alternatives . But , as always , the success of a monopoly was also its undoing . The new high price of oil sent geologists scurrying out all over the world looking for new reserves . Britain and Norway developed the fields under the North Sea , the American oil companies were allowed to finish the Alaskan pipeline , and dozens of other small countries began to find and develop deposits . Mexico , it turned out , had had oil all along , but had n't wanted to reveal its resources for fear of being exploited , as the Arabs had been for decades . In addition , the old patterns of ever increasing consumption were quickly reversed . Yale economist Paul MacAvoy has calculated that OPEC 's price distortions only lasted from 1974 to 1977 . By that time , the market forces had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the wise and efficient use of resources everywhere . Everywhere , that is , except the United States . Here , unfortunately , events had taken a different turn . Almost from the day in February 1976 when Congress had instructed that the price of domestic oil be lowered , Americans had once again rushed back to their old pre-embargo habits . Over the next twelve months , big-car divisions of the three major auto companies broke sales records in every month of the year . Small cars were left sitting in the lots , and even huge rebate programs failed to win back the public to conservation . Gasoline consumption also resumed its pre-embargo climb , surpassing the 1973 record in 1977 , and breaking it again in 1978 . We were headed for even higher consumption in 1979 , until events in Iran put a stop to it . Domestic producers , on the other hand , could not begin to hope to make back their money from drilling for new oil . They sat on their hands or put their money into real estate . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no time between 1976 and 1979 that motorists could n't get gas . How did we do it ? The answer is the same . We made up for our self-inflicted domestic shortages by importing still more oil . From the crack of the gun in February 1976 , our imports once again took off , climbing from 33 percent to almost 50 percent by mid-1979 . In fact , it 's a good thing the Iranian revolution happened when it did . Had things gone on any longer , the eventual crash , whatever form it took , would have been far worse . Just about everything Congress did to solve the energy crisis in the 1970s was aimed at one thing ? keeping cheap gas flowing to the consumers . Washington was filled with liberal congressmen singing the joys of conservation and wringing their hands about foreign dependence . Yet not one of them was ever willing to accept the simple formula that would have ended the whole dilemma ? paying a market price for our own oil . I T IS COMMONLY assumed that the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 finally curbed the nation 's appetite for foreign oil . That is not quite correct . Redoubled international oil prices and the resulting rise in the cost of gasoline certainly reminded people of the realities of the world oil situation . But the effect would probably have been temporary once again , had not the second gas shortage finally convinced President Carter that domestic price controls werea self-defeating policy and should be abandoned . Carter bravely announced in late 1979 that he would phase out price controls by the fall of 1981 . Incredibly , even at this late date , congressmen howled , and consumer groups moaned , that the president was abandoning his apparent constitutional responsibility to provide Americans with cheap energy . Yet the payoff came almost immediately . Within one year , U.S. oil imports fell by 25 percent , back to their 1975 level . Oil drilling increased as never before although oil is still getting harder to find ) , and consumers finally began demonstrating hitherto unsuspected capabilities for conserving energy . President Reagan 's January decision , which accelerated Carter 's schedule by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new oil has increased by 50 percent in the last six months . Consumption has dropped another 20 percent . Domestic oil production is holding steady , and consumers ? finally deprived of the " protection " of Congress ? seem permanently set on a conservation course . The unanticipated ? though predictable ? result of this new realism has been that energy prices are now falling on the world market . Throughout the 1970s , our energy policy was to prop up world oil prices by creating a domestic shortage and then making up for it by buying in the world market . Without our support , OPEC would have been defunct by 1977 . Now it is falling apart anyway . Americans are buying 2.2 million barrels a day less than we were before President Carter launched the repeal of the price controls in 1979 . This is the exact amount of the current world glut . Left to the mercies of supply and demand , OPEC is finding it can do nothing more than set its prices where the market tells it to . The Seven ( weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps not entirely . We still import just over 30 percent of our oil , which is about where we were in 1973 just before the embargo . What we could do now is to put a modest tax on imported oil ? perhaps two dollars a barrel ? in order to pay the costs of building a strategic petroleum reserve ; this would be a fair measure of the risks we incur by importing some of our oil . Both Europe and Japan have long used high government taxes to discourage consumption , which is why they were much less affected by the Iranian events than we were , even though they import nearly all their oil . 34 Yet all these wise and conscientious measures would still have to run the gauntlet of shortsighted " consumer protectors . " There are still enough Toby Moffetts and Edward Kennedys in Washington to put on a magic show of preaching conservation with one hand while subsidizing consumption with the other . W HERE DO the oil companies fit into all this ? Those Enemies of the People , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1975 it probably did n't seem a bad guess to predict that they would have been nationalized within a few years . It is easy enough now to see what happened to the oil companies in the 1970s , and why we hated them so much . The problem was that the oil companies were getting weaker . During the 1950s and ' 60s , they had bullied their way through the producing countries , robbing them for the benefit of Europeans and Americans and bringing home the goods at ridiculously low prices . When things got difficult , there were always the Marines and the CIA to hold up our interests . But in the 1970s all that changed . The oil companies found themselves up against a more firmly knit cartel with better control over the resources than they had . What could we do but hate them ? They had failed us miserably . As Eric Hoffer said of revolutions , it is usually when the public feels the government weakening that it expresses all its hidden resentments . The oil companies have now lost their preeminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the transactions between the producing and consuming countries . Now they handle only about 40 percent . More and more , the consuming countries are dealing directly with the producers . In addition , the OPEC nations are building their own refining operations , buying tankers , and moving " downstream " in the oil business . The future for the oil companies , of course , is not bleak . The value of their remaining oil resources has increased enormously . Their profits have risen by 20 percent per year since 1973 . They are still the world 's specialists in exploration and drilling technology . hi addition , they are diversifying into other fields and energy technologies . They will probably do as they have always done ? quite well . Is the energy crisis over , then ? Not quite . Unfortunately , we still have a forty-year-old hangover to deal with ? the chaotic state of resources , created by government intervention in the natural-gas industry . The havoc is almost too complicated to delineate . ( For an excellent account . read Tom Bethell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , June 1979 . ) Price controls were originally imposed in 1938 because of a supposed " monopoly . " Actually , there was no monopoly at all . Consumers had a choice of several other fuels , and gas drilling is one of the most decentralized industries in the country . One out of every two hundred Americans owns interest in a natural-gas well . In 1954 , one producer tried to raise the price of gas from three to four cents a thousand cubic feet . This ridiculously low price had originally been granted only as an open invitation for the pipeline companies to build their connections into the oil fields . Before that , the producers had flared off their gas as a waste product of oil drilling . But a Wisconsin state consumer authority , reacting to this insignificant price increase , forced the Federal Power Commission to extend its control back to the wellhead price as well . The decision was upheld in the courts , and Congress has never mustered the will to change it . The results have been utterly perverse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one was ever encouraged to go out and find more . The only gas we have used is the " waste product " now Source : Department of Energy associated with oil deposits . Yet all indications now are that there are staggering amounts of natural gas ? perhaps as much as 200 years ' supply at current prices ? in different kinds of formations in the earth . The situation finally reached a crisis with the " natural-gas shortages " of the winter of 1977 . These " shortages , " again , were nothing but the result of price controls . The law had never extended federal control over pricing within the producing states themselves . By 1977 , gas prices in the intrastate market were four times the price in the interstate market . Most producing states , like Texas , Louisiana , and Oklahoma , which collect large royalties , simply refused to send any more gas north , where consumers were still paying 1960s prices ; hence the shortages . The hopelessness of government efforts to anticipate market prices can be seen in the 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived as a victory over the consumer advocates . Toby Moffett and the gas-guzzling suburbanites once again tried to ensure their constituents cheap energy at other people 's expense . They failed , in that the Carter administration finally decided on a phased program ending in complete decontrol in 1985 . It is said that when the vote against continuing price controls was finally taken , Representative Moffett left the House , fell against a tree , and wept . He could have saved his tears . Congress , in its wisdom , decided to anticipate the future by allowing natural-gas prices to rise to the 1978 level of oil prices ? equivalent to $15 a barrel ? by 1985 . Then they could go where they would . Yet in less than a year that price was already hopelessly out of date . Taking inflation into account , natural-gas consumers are once again paying 1960s prices for energy . ( Because of the resulting shortages , industry and utilities are rapidly being squeezed out of the market , and consumption of natural gas is now concentrated almost entirely in home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed that all gas found below 15,000 feet could be free from price controls . Previously , most gas had been found at 5,000 feet . This spurred new exploration , which started turning up gas reserves no one had ever dreamed possible . It is now clear that there are probably huge reserves between 5,000 and 15,000 feet as well . But the owners of gas deposits below 15,000 feet have now become opponents of decontrol . They fear that they will be undersold by all the gas that obviously exists between 5,000 and 15,000 feet . This does n't promise a very orderly development of resources . In a final irony , the pipeline owners themselves have become a principal opponent of deregulation . They are paid according to the amount of gas that flows through their pipelines . They fear , quite reasonably , that if prices are decontrolled , people will start conserving gas . That will cut down on their pipeline transmission , and lose them money . Thus , as always , the regulated have ended up falling in love with their regulations . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decontrolling the price of natural gas intolerable . Yet there is hardly any choice . In fact , removing price controls right now ? as the Reagan administration is beginning to propose ? would be even easier . There is no time like the present for getting rid of price controls . The medicine would be only slightly harder to swallow than our current decontrol of oil prices , which people have hardly noticed at all . The only alternative is that natural gas will be a resource that we simply do n't use . Once again one may ask : if we are creating artificial shortages by controlling the price of natural gas , where are we making them up ? And once again , the answer is the same . We are importing more oil . It is estimated that between one and two million barrels per day of our current oil imports are the result of our failure to use our own natural gas . The subsidy of natural-gas consumers is also delaying the introduction of rooftop solar energy . Decontrol would unquestionably mean higher natural-gas prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the price of oil and the introduction of new technologies . People are never going to conserve , or use solar energy in home heating , as long as they are paying fifteen-year-old prices for natural gas . But without the foreign oil needed to make up for the natural-gas shortage , OPEC would be about as important to the American economy as a Turkish bazaar . HE ENERGY CRISIS , then , is half won . We have ended OPEC 's dominance of the market within a few short months by swallowing what turned out to be a relatively mild pill and accepting a market price for our own oil . All we have to do now is decontrol our natural-gas prices . and we will be home free . There will be another mild period of adjustment , and soon we will be on a firm , stable , and innovative energy course . Are we up to it ? Can Americans tackle the energy problems of the 1980s ? Stay tuned .                @ @ @ @ @
