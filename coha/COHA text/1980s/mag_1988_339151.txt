This is the first in a series of articles that will attempt to stimulate debate by examining the issues facing the next President , exploring solutions and analyzing how the candidates are dealing with them . <P> An appalling number of America 's schools are atrocious . <P> Study after depressing study confirms what has been painfully obvious to millions of parents , teachers , prospective employers and students . Every year our schools turn out more than a million young adults who can not keep up with the intellectual demands of an increasingly technological economy or with their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan . In addition to the 700,000 who , despite twelve years of what passes for formal education , have such poor reading skills that they can not digest a newspaper or fill out a job application , an identical number drop out , forfeiting whatever educational benefits might be osmotically obtained from simply showing up for class . <P> Far too many inner-city schools are less centers of learning than custodial institutions complete with wardens ( principals ) and guards ( teachers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some so preoccupied with the three Cs  --  crack , crime and casual sex  --  that they have no time for the three Rs . But the educational blight is not confined to underclass ghettos and barrios . Despite efforts to upgrade the math skills of U.S. students , a recent survey indicates that nearly half of American 17-year-olds can not perform simple calculations that are normally learned in junior high school . Other surveys have documented equally dreary student performance in reading , writing and critical thinking . So ill equipped is the current crop of high school graduates that U.S. corporations spend $25 billion a year for remedial * training programs for new employees on whom state , local and federal agencies have already lavished $130 billion in an attempt to teach them to read , write and cipher . <P> As the Department of Education warned in 1983 , a foreign power scheming to weaken America could not have concocted a more insidious plot than the debasement of public education . The threat to U.S. security ranges from the fact that nearly a quarter of military recruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students in science and engineering . At the dawn of a new era of international competition , less than one-quarter of public high school students are currently enrolled in a foreign-language course . The bulk of American students can not locate the world 's most important nations on a map if their lives depend on it , which , in a sense , they do . <P> Each new revelation of the flunking performance of many U.S. students provokes a loud outcry for tougher standards , better instruction , classroom innovations . So far , all the noise has had shockingly limited impact on what actually goes on in the schools . Most high schools still do not require students to meet widely accepted standards for math and science . On the average , a student takes only 2.3 credits in math and 2 in science to graduate , instead of the 3 credits in each subject recommended by the National Commission on Excellence in Education .
