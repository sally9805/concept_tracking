The little man ran around the carpeted floor of the biggest living room in America as if he were a windup toy whose mainspring suddenly had gone haywire . His arms were pumping , his head was down . His feet hit the ground in an uneven pace , one spiked shoe and one waffle-soled special , but even he didn ' t notice . He was going too fast . " Home plate , " Joe Morgan was thinking . Home plate all the way . In any other ballpark in America , that wouldn ' t even have been a consideration , because he hit the bejeebers out of that ball , and in any other ballpark , everyone would have been standing and clapping and an informal reception line would have been forming at the plate . In the biggest living room in America , though , he had to run . This was the Houston Astrodome , and Joe Morgan knows how life is lived in the Houston Astrodome . The ball just doesn ' t go over the fence here . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodgers , the Phillies , the Pittsburgh Pirates , any of ' em - in our ballpark , and you ' ll see what happens , " he explained later yesterday afternoon . " You ' ll see what happens to their big statistics . Nobody hits home runs here . " So Joe Morgan ran , and while Philadelphia Phillies ' right fielder Bake McBride made a not-good-enough reach and the ball whacked off a San Fracisco Giants ' logo above the 390-foot mark on the wall , and while the throw and the relay came back to the infield , Joe Morgan ran some more and finally held at third base . He was thinking home plate , but when coach Don Leppert held up his hands , the little man settled for third . Third was good enough . It had to be . " I wanted to go all the way , I was thinking all the way , because even with no outs , you never know what ' s going to happen in a game here , " he said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The result , of course , of Joe Morgan ' s triple to lead off the 11th inning yesterday simply was the Houston Astros ' 1-0 win . There were the two intentional walks that followed , and there was the sacrifice fly to left that brought in the run , and there was the explosion of Texas happiness that followed that . The result , of course , was the Astros ' 2-1 lead over the Phillies in this best-of- five National League playoff series that could be ended this afternoon . Only someone like the little man himself could find any fault at all with the finish . " The ballpark , " he said again . " The ballpark hurts us . Do you know why we have to win ? We have to win to show people we have some terrific players here . Nobody knows us . Nobody knows what we can do . We just don ' t have the stats that these other teams have , and the ballpark is the reason . " Get us in the World Seies . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this team play . " The fierceness of the little man is almost evangelical . He is a Sunday morning sermonizer , talking about the Astros . He is a door- to-door salesman , the most earnest of voices . He is a leader . There is not that much that he has to prove about himself - he is 36 years old and has won just about everything one player can win in this game , personally and collectively - but he is out to prove how good his team really is . What is it that he always says ? " You guys came close last year by yourselves , and now I ' m here to bring you the rest of the way . " It is half joke , half boast , but he will be damned if he won ' t try to make things happen that way . " We have to know how good we really are , " he said . " It ' s like the situation in Los Angeles . We went out there and lost three in a row and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the locker room before the game and talked to everybody . " I felt it was my job , part of what I ' m supposed to do . I said that we shouldn ' t be putting our heads down , that we earned the right to lose those three games by the way we played all season . We hadn ' t lost anything . We had earned the right to lose three and we had earned the right to play a playoff . " And we did . We just blew ' em away in that final game , didn ' t we ? " The success of the Astros this season has been tied directly to Morgan ' s success . He came to the team in the spring as a free-agent question mark , an older guy who was coming off a bad year at the end of so many good ones at Cincinnati . He was given a one-year contract , " just to see what he can do . " Even he was not so sure about what would happen . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finished . He said he was not stupid . If pitchers kept getting him out , then he had to worry about his future . " It took me all of last year and then half of this year to find out what was wrong , " he said . " I looked at films and more films , just to see what I was doing . Finally , a month and a half ago , I saw it . A simple thing . A little thing . I was holding my bat about three inches farther back than I did when I was going well . I saw that . I made the change . I started hitting overnight . I hit .320 the rest of the season . I bet I would have 25 homers if I weren ' t playing in this park . I was able to help . The team needed me , and I was able to help . " The help has arrived at just the right time . Just the way he promised it would . When J.R . Richard left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the game yesterday dragged on and on , scoreless , as Cesar Cedeno left with an injured ankle and there weren ' t but one or two long-ball hitters left in the lineup , Joe Morgan was there . He started with this team when he was just a kid , was traded to Cincinnati and became a star . He is back now , purchased on a marked- down basis , but doing what he is accustomed to doing . There is a problem with his right knee , but he runs " faster than just about everyone else on this team . " There is the big ballpark , but he hits just as fast as he can . He hits . He continues to win . " I made some statements when I left this team in 1971 , " the little man said yesterday . " I told guys to go back and look ' em up . I said that I was going to come back and win this team a pennant . " I ' ve always felt I owed this team something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed me when nobody else was looking to sign a 5-foot-7 , 140-pound second baseman . There ' ve been a lot of teams who have been interested in me since I became a star , but the Houston Astros were interested first . " I figure I owe this team something , and if we win that one more game this season , I figure the debt is paid . . . "
