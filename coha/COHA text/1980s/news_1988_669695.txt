' ' Forthcoming chemical agents with selective man-stopping power will put into the hands of an assailant a weapon with which he can not be attacked. ' ' // New research held out ' ' the possibility of great innate differences in vulnerability to chemical agents between different populations. ' ' // The title , in two chilling words , captured the essence of Swedish Prof. Carl Larson ' s article : ' ' Ethnic Weapons. ' ' // Had the treatise appeared in a science fiction journal , it might have been easy to dismiss as fantasy . But it appeared in Military Review , an official journal of the United States Army Command General Staff College , at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. // // This 1970 article is one of the few indications that military strategists have seriously contemplated the implications of ethnic weapons - chemical or biological agents that could be targeted against a racial or ethnic group by exploiting a distinctive genetic characteristic. // There is no hard evidence that any country has tried to produce such a substance , even for defensive research. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible to design a weapon that can kill one set of persons and leave the others unharmed , ' ' says Erhard Geissler , a researcher at the Central Institute for Molecular Biology in East Berlin. // But other researchers suggest there is no fundamental scientific reason why such a weapon couldn ' t be produced. // Thinking the unthinkable // ' IF you have cellular characteristics that occur in a particular ethnic group . . . and you could target these , obviously it would work , ' ' says Lars Beckman , a geneticist and president of the University of Umea , Sweden. // ' ' We don ' t lack the fundamental knowledge , ' ' he says . ' ' The possibility has long been there . It just hasn ' t been exploited yet. ' ' // Dr. Beckman and others interviewed expressed abhorrence at even the idea of an ethnic weapon. // ' ' That ' s something we don ' t even think about , ' ' says Lt. Col. David Huxsoll , commander of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t know anything about it . And I don ' t care to know anything about it , ' ' he says , growing visibly agitated . ' ' Nothing in my knowledge suggests that anyone is interested in producing them - even our adversaries. ' ' // In Moscow , the response is the same. // ' ' If I am against biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons , I am a million times more against this weapon , ' ' says Prof. Nikolai Enikolopian , director of the Soviet Institute of Synthetical Polymeric Materials in Moscow. // His revulsion is deep-seated and personal . ' ' I am an Armenian . . . What if someone developed a weapon that could kill the Armenians and do no harm to the Turks ? ' ' // Professor Enikolopian acknowledges , however , that genetic research is developing at such a rapid pace that even a single cell can now provide abundant information about a person. // ' ' We ' ve seen nothing to date that looks like ( ethnic weapons are ) a credible possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical Defense Establishment at Porton Down . ' ' But look at what genetic science is doing today in comparison to what it was doing five or 10 years ago , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s a burgeoning science. ' ' // Indeed , researchers have already acquired a substantial body of knowledge about genetic variations between racial and ethnic groups in the course of routine medical research. // ' ' The obvious example is sickle cell anemia , ' ' a disease prevalent among blacks , Colonel Huxsoll says. // A weapon in a glass ? // PROF . Jorma Miettinen , a chemical weapons expert at the Department of Radiochemistry at the University of Helsinki , says researchers have already discovered ' ' an ethnic weapon , in a way . ' ' It is a substance that would , for example , sicken 10 percent of the Africans who drink it , but would leave Finns and other Scandinavians unaffected. // The substance ? Milk. // Most children in Scandinavia are born with an enzyme that allows their bodies to utilize the lactose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enzyme is lacking in substantial numbers of the population. // Enzymes have long been spotted as one of the more vulnerable links in the life chain . Nerve gas specifically attacks enzymes , leading to a loss of control of body functions and , potentially , death . An ethnic weapon might , for example , attack certain kinds of enzymes and leave others alone. // These genetic differences have not escaped the notice of the Pentagon . Documents indicate that over the last three decades , the Defense Department has either conducted or funded research on diseases and disorders that occur more frequently among American blacks and American Indians. // In the 1950s , says Rutgers University faculty associate Leonard Cole , Pentagon researchers exposed dock workers at a naval installation in Norfolk , Va. , to organisms meant to simulate a fungus disease that might affect blacks more than whites . There is , however , no evidence that the research yielded any practical results - or that it formed the basis for any experiments with offensive weapons. // A weapon of disinformation // ' EVERYTHING that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as disinformation . . . to form additional moral distaste for the subject , ' ' says Joseph Douglass , a Pentagon consultant who has written extensively on chemical and biological warfare. // In fact , ' ' ethnic weapons ' ' have become a staple of Soviet propaganda . A favored tactic is to place a story in a friendly news outlet in the third world , then replay the story in the official Soviet news media . Radio Moscow ' s domestic service , for example , replayed a story in 1985 from the official Angolan government newspaper , claiming that white-ruled South Africa maintained a ' ' top-secret center for biological research ' ' in the Transvaal provincial town of Louis Trichardt . The report claimed that ethnic weapons aimed at ' ' the extermination of Africans and Asians ' ' were under development at the facility , with the help of the ' ' CIA and the Pentagon. ' ' // Have such ' ' disinformation ' ' efforts halted since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power ? // ' ' No , not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job it is to counter Soviet disinformation efforts. // At first blush , South Africa seems the only place where such munitions might have any conceivable utility . But one Pentagon official says that overlooks another obvious trouble spot. // ' ' I would think ( the Soviets ) would have an incentive to develop them - against the Chinese , ' ' says Prescott Ward , biotechnology chief in the research division at the Army ' s Chemical Research , Development , and Engineering Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground , Md. // A ' whole new line ' of agents // ' FROM what I ' ve read , ( ethnic weapons are ) more on the level of a ' possibility , ' ' ' says Nikita Smidovich , a Soviet diplomat in the Foreign Ministry ' s Department on Peaceful Use of Outer Space and Nuclear Energy . ' ' But my scientists have told me we have no more than five years before the life sciences make a breakthrough , and we have a whole new line of agents. ' ' // That , Mr. Smidovich says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological and chemical warfare to ensure that such weapons remain in the realm of speculation. <> <> // Revulsion at the concept of ' ethnic weapons ' is almost universal . But that ' s where the consensus ends. // Neither scientists nor military personnel agree on whether it ' s possible to make such weapons . A Swedish geneticist says the ' fundamental knowledge ' to produce ethnic armaments exists . A British counterpart says such weapons are not yet a ' credible possibility , ' though genetics is a ' burgeoning ' science . Others dismiss all talk of such weapons as disinformation. // The fact is , routine medical research has already produced substantial knowledge about genetic variations among racial groups. // //
