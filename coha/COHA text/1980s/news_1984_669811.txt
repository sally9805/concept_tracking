PARIS  --  Nothing is more important to the French Socialist Party than class struggle . Only the economic crisis forced the left last spring to make a radical switch from a Keynesian policy to austerity measures . But this new-found pragmatism shouldn ' t fool anybody . Socialist doctrine , which is based on the assumption that the French Revolution didn ' t finish the job , wants equality through social change more than anything else . The economy sneaked up on the Socialists , forcing them to take notice . But the Socialists ' real concern is the democratization of French society . And they have used the electoral system to do it . In hospitals , universities and the national health program , administrators formerly appointed must now stand for election . The comites d ' enterprise that oversee major companies must now have union representatives elected by workers . Candidates are proposed by the various unions . In local government , members of the regional councils previously appointed are now elected . This explains why decentralization was one of the Socialist ' s first major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not administrative . The Socialists were convinced that they would win the elections to the regional councils by destabilizing the local elites . Ironically , these elections have backfired on the Socialists . In all the professional elections , and especially in the national health sector , conservative labor groups have , for the past two years , won absolute majorities . In local elections , the traditional elite class did not fold , and a new generation of economically conservative leaders has emerged to counter the Socialist-Communist alliance . The Socialists have had some success . For example , the requirements for admission to the Ecole Nationale d ' Administration  --  the prestigious institution that trains the country ' s top civil servants  --  have been modified to permit the enrollment of labor leaders and local officials whose background and lack of formal education credentials would have otherwise excluded them . In 1983 , 21 of the 25 openings were awarded to members of the Communist and Socialist allied unions . Paradoxically , the most spectacular and unexpected reaction against democratization in the ENA came from the professional staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously protested the use of elections to choose ENA administrators , for they see it , and rightly so , as tantamount to the union taking control of the university . The Socialists have effected a great many changes in French society during their two and a half years in office . The opposition parties haven ' t really thought about how to counter this phenomenon , content to criticize the left ' s performance and results , without coming up with an alternative . The French right , true to form , fears ideas and fears ideology . It believes that the left ' s mistakes are Table ough in themselves to return the conservatives to power , without their having to advance a social plan or clarify their principles . It isn ' t clear whether a new conservative administration would only reflect the values of the old right  --  canceling out the Socialists ' reforms  --  or whether they would come up with a new conservative ideology attacking traditional French statism . <> Following the broad appeal of the Reagan and Thatcher experiences , conservative and classic liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians remain wary of this new brand of conservatism that thrives on anti-statist and populist ideas . They have long been attached to classic institutions that hold the central government supreme . This is particularly the case in the opposition parties that recruit members more from the top echelons of the civil service than from private industry . One element of leftist policy presents particular obstacles for the right : Mr. Mitterrand is the strongest Atlanticist to occupy the Elysee Palace in a long time . In spite of some pro-Third World rhetoric , Mr. Mitterrand is more committed to the U.S. than any of his predecessors . The reason is that he is a pessimist and is convinced that world leaders are usually crooks , especially those of the Soviet Union . Unlike Valery Giscard d ' Estaing , Mr. Mitterrand does not believe gentle diplomacy is the answer to the world ' s problems , and he shares the U.S. view that the only way to check Soviet expansion is through a show of force . This explains French interventions in Chad , Lebanon and against Iran . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be characterized as a neat split between right and left . On the left , anti-Soviet Atlanticists share power with an overtly pro-Soviet Communist Party . Also on the left are advocates of a new industrial revolution , fascinated by advanced technologies , economic revival and tax cuts . On the right , advocates of centralization , statism and neutralism are in bed with strongly Atlanticist neoconservatives . A new pattern of bipolarization can ' t be excluded : realistic modernists on one side and nostalgic statists on the other . This could be favored by the new voting rules , based on proportional representation , the government is working on  --  rules designed in part to benefit the Communists by gaining them access to the controlling bodies of various state institutions . For the rightwing opposition parties to take advantage of this unintended opportunity , they will need to enter a new ideological era . They still have a long way to go.  --  - Mr. Sorman is author of " La Revolution Conservatrice Americaine. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
