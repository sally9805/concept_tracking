A Senate panel cuts spending even more than the President did <P> The 21 men and one woman seated around tables pushed together to form a hollow square called out numbers in what seemed a mystifying code . Aides chalked the figures on blackboards , erased them almost instantly , then chalked new ones . A horse-betting parlor ? Commodities trading pit ? No , the meeting room of the Senate Budget Committee , which last week gave a flying start to Ronald Reagan 's plan to slash federal spending . <P> In a mere four days , the committee voted to reduce planned expenditures in fiscal 1982 , which starts Oct. 1 , by $36.4 billion-actually $2.3 billion more than Reagan asked * Combining bluster and blarney , Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico easily held his eleven fellow Republicans together against all attempts by the ten Democrats to narrow reductions in social programs . Frustrated and divided , the Democrats in the end joined in a unanimous vote for the full package .

Last week 's vote , they cautioned , must be upheld by a long series of further actions in the Democratic-controlled House as well as the G.O.P.-dominated Senate . Also the comparatively low approval rating the President now has in polls ( see box ) might make those forthcoming fights harder to win .

An effort by members of Reagan 's kitchen cabinet to launch a lobbying campaign for budget and tax cuts fell apart last week . The Coalition for a New Beginning , which was to organize the grassroots effort , disbanded after some of Reagan 's corporate supporters complained that they felt they were being dunned for contributions .

That , to put it mildly , would not help boost the President 's poll ratings . <P> Despite such concerns , Reagan easily quelled a potential bipartisan congressional rebellion against his budget plans before it ever really got started . When the President journeyed to Capitol Hill for a meeting with Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday , he had to contend with two bits of bad news . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had just predicted that federal spending might soar as much as $25 billion above Reagan 's forecast for the next fiscal year , and that the deficit might consequently balloon to a record $70 billion , vs. $45 billion projected by the White House . Reason : the CBO doubted that inflation and interest rates will come down anywhere near as rapidly as the Administration expects . Partly because of this gloomy forecast , Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee agreed during a six-hour meeting Monday night to support a move to trim cost-of-living increases scheduled next year in Social Security pensions and veterans ' benefits , two programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
