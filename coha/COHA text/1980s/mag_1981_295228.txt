WARLOCK by Jim Harrison <P> Delacorte ; 262 pages ; $13.95 <P> If Henry Miller , S.J. Perelman and Walt Whitman had holed up in a Michigan roadhouse to concoct a mystery yarn , the resulting melange of cosmic erotica , snappish humor and hirsute lyricism might resemble this send-up of the " tecs " by Poet and Novelist Jim Harrison ( Farmer , Legends of the Fall ) . His mock hero , Johnny Lundgren , nicknamed Warlock , is a reluctant Swedish-American gumshoe who has been fired from his job as a foundation executive . He flees to the comforting semi-poverty of rural northern Michigan where irrelevance turns to comic Scandinavian angst . Trysts in his overheated Subaru prove difficult ; his forays at gourmet cooking are disasters ; insolvency threatens . Then , in the nick of time , Lundgren 's wife Diana gets him a job with Dr. Rabun , a prosthetic Edison who designs sexual aids that imitate the motion of swimming porpoises . The doctor 's problems : his extensive investments in timber and real estate are being skimmed , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warlock 's assignment : remove the bad apples from the barrel . <P> Lundgren sets out with the family Airedale , a dim , stubborn beast named Hudley who drinks by submerging his head and opening his mouth . An uncertain backwoods cunning helps the make-believe p.i . collar the lumber rustlers , so it 's on to Florida to deal with Dr. Rabun 's wife and son . <P> A series of manic bumbles follows . A naive disguise of clipped hair , a new mustache and a tanning parlor 's efforts almost gets Lundgren expelled from a " straight " bar in Key West as a gay tourist . Ever the optimist , Lundgren reflects : " Rare , indeed , is a woman or man so sullied that they ca n't be rebaptized with a few drinks , a pizza , and a shower . " Disdaining the private eye 's code of resisting advances by female suspects , Warlock goes on an erotic tear . Mrs. Rabun , an art gallery owner , lures him with cocaine , and her friend Laura Fardel offers the glandular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far from being the homosexual his father said he was , is a tough fishing guide who nearly leaves a spluttering Lundgren for the sharks . <P> Drowning might have been better than enlightenment . Rabun , the relatives disclose , is a nasty pervert and financial highwayman robbing them of rightful trust funds . From the home front , Lundgren learns that Diana and Rabun have been carrying on in his absence . His cinematic version of revenge brakes just short of disaster . <P> Harrison 's humor in Warlock puts the wrong man in the trench coat . Lundgren is a poet , not a flatfoot , a satyr trying his hoof at logic and deduction . Like most literary fools since Don Quixote saddled up Rosinante , Lundgren is redeemed by his own goodness . Harrison 's taste for the bat ty sometimes cloys : " He really was n't so much a fool as he was giddy about still being alive . " Lengthy erotic descriptions tend to become postcoital arias . But Har rison scores well on the firing range : his humor usually strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the mystery novel fun to read . War lock demonstrates that it is equally enjoy able to spoof.
