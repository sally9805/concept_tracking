When Nancy Reagan entered Bethesda Naval Hospital two weeks ago , her plight , like that of Betty Ford 13 years ago , focused national attention on breast cancer . The affliction is the No. 3 killer of American women , after heart disease and lung cancer . The First Lady 's case underscored the importance of early detection : her tumor was discovered during an annual mammogram , which is recommended for older women . But her choice of treatment caused some consternation and puzzlement in the medical community . <P> Mrs. Reagan 's decision to have a modified radical mastectomy  --  the removal of the entire breast and underarm lymph nodes  --  struck some doctors as extreme . The reason : her tumor was just a quarter-inch in diameter  --  small enough to have been safely excised by a less disfiguring operation called a lumpectomy , in which the tumor is removed along with a minimum of surrounding tissue . The First Lady also chose to have the surgery immediately after her breast was biopsied . According to prevailing medical wisdom , it is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thoroughly examined and several treatment options considered . <P> " It 's my opinion that she probably was overtreated , " says Dr. I. Craig Henderson , director of the Breast Evaluation Center at Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute . Henderson notes that several studies have shown that lumpectomy , followed by radiation treatment , is every bit as effective as mastectomy for even average-size breast tumors . In both procedures , women with early-stage cancers have a more than 90% chance of surviving at least five years after surgery . Modified radical mastectomy , however , remains the choice of most surgeons for women with large tumors . <P> Mrs. Reagan 's decision to go from biopsy to surgery without pause was equally disturbing to many physicians . A complete biochemical evaluation of the excised tissue takes a few days , contends Radiation Therapist Robert L. Goodman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine . The additional time gives patients a chance to seek second opinions and discuss the treatment with loved ones . Says Henderson : " Months or years later , they may become depressed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Even so , there are good reasons why the First Lady may have proceeded as she did . For women with small breasts , lumpectomy may not offer a significant cosmetic advantage over mastectomy . And some women feel safer if the entire breast is removed . Says Goodman : " There are women who fear they will spend 23 hours a day worrying that the cancer may have returned if their breast is left intact . " <P> Will other women be more inclined to choose mastectomy , following the First Lady 's example ? Dr. Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh , a leading proponent of lumpectomy , thinks not . Most women are aware of the alternatives , he says . Indeed , eleven states have laws requiring doctors to inform breast- cancer patients of all treatment options . Last week , as Mrs. Reagan convalesced , it was already apparent that her battle with cancer was having at least one positive effect : radiologists around the country reported that appointments for mammograms were up sharply .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
