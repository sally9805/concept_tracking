At 80 , Anthony Powell has earned his position as the " doyen " of English letters many times over . Probably the most amusing British novelist of substance writing since the death of Evelyn Waugh , his brilliant 12-volume series , " A Dance to the Music of Time , " chronicles over half a century of English high  --  and low  --  life with grace and subtlety . Its vast gallery of comic and serious characters rivals Dickens and Thackeray , scaled down and stripped of Victorian bathos and overstatement . But , as Valentine Beals , the character who serves as the third-person narrator of Mr. Powell ' s new novel , " The Fisher King " ( Norton , 256 pages , $15. 95 ) , remarks in another context , " As with all truly original productions , it is impossible to describe them . " What makes Mr. Powell ' s writing so enthralling is his ability to shade , tune and tint in his own way . Even a barroom encounter with Mr. Jack , a classic drunken bore , becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Beals was fully aware of what was happening , he was listening to an anecdote about a baronet ' s widow , with whom Mr. Jack had found himself alone in Theodoric ' s Mausoleum at Ravenna , while conducting a tour . Beals . . . then found himself entrapped by the common enough bore ' s decoy of apparently having something of further interest to say . When Mr. Jack moved on to the statement that an aunt of his had been briefly mistress to Frank Harris , Beals nibbled the bait , the trap closed , and he had to listen to a series of verbal vignettes illustrating Mr. Jack ' s picaresque life-style : the girl with the stutter picked up in Bruges , where the two of them lay in bed listening to the carillon ; something about a married woman and a fire-escape in Buffalo , halfway through which Beals managed to extricate himself . " An accomplished art historian , Mr. Powell ' s verbal portraits and landscapes are dazzling and precise , but always leave just enough to the reader ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader that is the litmus test of intelligent writing . Mr. Powell ' s keen musician ' s ear weaves sound , dialogue and actual musical fragments into the fabric of narratives that might otherwise seem a bit tweedy and even ragged at the edges . His love of the language , which only occasionally intoxicates him , is a joy to share . Gentle laughter , mild melancholy and a measured sense of the mystical combine to render the most prosaic acts or conversations subtle and interesting . Unlike his character Beals , a writer of solid , workmanlike historical potboilers , Mr. Powell is undaunted by the paradox that " writing romantic fiction consisted largely in transforming imaginary improbable events in a manner to make them appear realistic . That ruled out most of the far more improbable events of real life . " " The Fisher King " is a shimmering jewel . While hardly his masterpiece , it forms a graceful finial to a massive literary edifice . It will go down best as an after-dinner drink rather than an aperitif . But readers new to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into " A Dance to the Music of Time " ( all of which is now available in paperback ) before trying to taste " The Fisher King . " The new book ' s setting is at once routine and mythic  --  a present-day North Sea cruise touching on ancient historic sites along the British coast such as Hadrian ' s Wall , where the spirits of Roman legionnaires and ancient druids hover among the ruins and runes along with staid , uppermiddle-class tourists . The central character , a sardonic , grotesquely maimed photographer named Saul Henchman , reminds Valentine Beals of a misty figure from Arthurian legend , the Fisher King , who was crippled and condemned to impotence by a curse . Circling round Henchman are his beautiful companion , Barberina Rookwood , a promising ballerina who , having given up the dance to serve Henchman , is now having second thoughts ; two admirers of Barberina ; and a series of entertaining secondary characters who , even when sitting motionless in the lounge of the good ship Alecto ( the name , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Mr. Powell ' s intertwining of the everyday and the allegorical ) , are capable of sprightly dialogue . The novel functions simultaneously on three levels : as a comedy of modern manners ( one might almost call it a sitting-room comedy transferred to a cruise ship ) ; as a suspense story about the real-life mysteries of human ties ; and as ancient allegory applied to a contemporary and seemingly trivial setting . By the time the plot resolves itself  --  with just enough uncertainty remaining to make it plausible  --  one almost feels physically present at the final scene , under an ominous Norse sky where " the rain had abated a little , though not altogether . In spite of foul weather there was exhilaration in the northern air . The leaden surface of the loch was just perceptibly heaving in the wind , still blowing from time to time in fairly strong gusts . On the far side of the waters , low rounded hills , soft and mysterious , concealed in luminous haze the frontiers of Thule : the edge of the known world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond which the fearful cataract of torrential seas cascaded down into Chaos.
