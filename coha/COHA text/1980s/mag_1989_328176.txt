It was a weird political moment , even by Australia 's raucous standards . There was Prime Minister Bob Hawke on national television last week , wiping a tear from his eye and telling his countrymen that yes , he had been unfaithful to Hazel , his wife of 33 years . In a paroxysm of soul baring , he reviewed his boozy past ( Hawke was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for beer drinking ) and his decision nine years ago to go cold turkey . " It was getting to the stage where , at the end of the day , I was looking forward too much to a drink . " <P> None of this was news to Australians  --  or anyone who has read Blanche d'Alpuget 's frank biography of the gregarious trade unionist whose back- slapping mateyness helped make him Australia 's most popular politician . But why did Hawke choose this moment to make a prime-time confession ? Supporters think Hawke was trying to make up for insulting media play of his wife 's recent face-lift . Opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect rising interest rates and a soaring deficit have had on his standing in the polls .
