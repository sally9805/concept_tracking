In addition , the tall , thin youth was found guilty of second-degree murder in the rifle slaying of another bank officer who was also lured to the former Jenkins family farm last Sept. 29. // The 18-year-old , who will spend at least his next 18 years in prison , appeared impassive as the twin guilty verdicts were read in the tense courtroom here in rural southwestern Minnesota . But when his bail was revoked and sheriff ' s deputies moved in with handcuffs , Mr. Jenkins broke into tears and clung to his weeping mother . After several minutes they were gently pried apart. // " One can not feel exultant in any case like this , " said Thomas L. Fabel , Minnesota Deputy Attorney General . " It is the sad culmination of a tragedy for three separate families that began last Sept. 29 and we can only hope now that the families can begin to put their lives back together again . " <> <> Jury Meets 10 Hours // // The verdict from the panel of seven women and five men came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , in a small , sparsely furnished , yellow jury room on the third- floor of the Lincoln County Courthouse in this small rural community 560 miles northwest of Chicago . The case and the two-and-a-half-week trial have been closely watched across this agricultural region where frustrated farmers experience mounting financial difficulties , as do their main creditors , the small-town local banks. // An appeal to the State Supreme Court is virtually certain . And Mr. Jenkins still faces charges of attempted murder in adjacent Rock County for firing at a pursuing police officer after the shootings. // But , for now , the verdict in the Fifth District Court murder trial , the county ' s first this century , seemed to provide an emotional release for many here . Spectators , court workers and relatives of the victims and the convicted stood around afterward wiping tears away , smoking furiously , talking solemnly or sitting quietly in remote corners. // It brought to an end , for the moment , a story that included a nationwide manhunt and began on a rainy Thursday morning last fall when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had always wanted to own a small-town bank , took Deems Thulin , his 37-year-old loan officer and a Vietnam veteran , to the former Jenkins farmhouse. // <> <> Bank Tried to Sell Farm // Their bank , the Buffalo Ridge State Bank in Ruthton , had been trying to sell the overgrown 10- acre plot since Mr. Jenkins ' s father , James L. Jenkins , a dairy farmer , abandoned it in 1980 as his marriage crumbled. // Mr. Blythe had received a phone call Sept. 28 from a man identifying himself as Ron Anderson . He professed interest in buying the farm and sought a 10 A.M. appointment for the next day . However , the bankers arrived early , finding the Jenkins truck . Mr. Blythe ' s wife , Susan , was dispatched to summon the authorities. // Seconds later , according to a police reconstruction , Mr. Thulin was shot in the throat , dying instantly from a bullet from Steven Jenkins ' s . 30-caliber M-1 carbine . Mr. Blythe , wounded in the back , fled around the house , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Easy Target // But his bright yellow rain slicker made an easy target . And , the jury found , he was quickly stalked by the younger Jenkins , an excellent marksman trained by a military veteran friend. // Mr. Blythe was shot four times and died in a ditch . The incident left four children fatherless. // Mr. Jenkins and his 46-year-old father were seen fleeing the scene by a part-time police officer . Three days later Steven Jenkins , who for years fashioned himself in dress and action as a junior commando with a shaved head , turned himself in to a police dispatcher in the small north Texas town of Paducah . His father was found on a trail outside town , an apparent shotgun suicide. // Much of the trial centered on marksmanship and guns in a rural area where both are so common that even self-service gas stations stock several shelves of ammunition . For the prosecution , Mr. Fabel and Michael Cable , county prosecutor , contended that because Mr. Jenkins , the diabetic father , had deteriorating eyesight and was unfamiliar with Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such accurate shooting. // Witnesses also testified that shortly before the shootings Steve Jenkins had inquired locally about buying dynamite and what caliber shell would pierce a bank ' s bulletproof windows . The father and son had recently returned from Texas and sought to restart their dairy operation . But bad credit references from Mr. Blythe ' s bank thwarted that plan. // <> <> Defense Blamed Father // The defense , presented by Allan Swen Anderson , contended Steven was at the scene of the shooting merely obeying his father , that the youth was hiding behind a garage the entire time and that he succeeded in dissuading his father from killing others on a list of perceived enemies. // This morning , however , the jury sent out questions regarding a definition of premeditation , indicating they had rejected less serious felony murder charges . Then at 11 : 29 A.M. , Lee A. Smith , the court clerk , read the guilty verdicts . Mr. Anderson clutched Steve ' s hand . Mr. Thulin ' s widow , Lynnette , gasped . And Mr. Blythe ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter H. Mann set sentencing for May 22 . For first-degree murder , Mr. Jenkins faces a mandatory life sentence with no parole possible for 18 years . For second-degree murder the sentence is 10 years , which could run concurrently or consecutively. // With his hand firmly on Mr. Jenkins ' neck , Deputy Vernon Dahl lead the youth away to jail through a crowd of sobbing friends , curious onlookers and jostling televison camera crews . Mr. Jenkins was placed in a patrol car precisely on the spot where last fall authorities had parked the bloody Blythe vehicle. // //
