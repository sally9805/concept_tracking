With $6.7 billion in sales , state lotteries help pay the bills <P> The lines snaked for blocks around neighborhood drugstores and newsstands earlier this month as hopeful New Yorkers waited to place their bets . Among them : Governor Mario Cuomo , who stood in the rain for 20 minutes in Manhattan to buy $5 worth of chances . " There 's something going on in this state , " he said . " It 's called greed . " No wonder . Fed by three successive drawings that failed to produce a big winner , New York 's lottery jackpot had ballooned to a record $22.1 million , the highest ever in North America . ( The world 's largest : Spain 's El Gordo , " the Fat One , " which in 1983 amassed a $73 million pot . ) In the final days before the drawing , tickets for the outsize prize were selling at the frenzied rate of a million an hour . <P> The four winners-a housewife , a machinist , a manicurist and a hospital maid-are understandably elated : each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax bite , for the next 21 years . Shortly after hearing that she had won , Weonta Fitzgerald , 64 , quit her job as a cleaning woman at Benedictine Hospital in Kingston , N.Y . " I was broke , now I 'm rich ! " she exulted . But the biggest winner by far did not have to wait in line : New York State , which stands to reap an estimated $11 million in education funds from that one giant jackpot alone . In fact , ticket sales are so brisk that this year the state figures to rake in $520 million in profit from $1.14 billion in lottery bets . <P> Squeezed by balanced-budget requirements and wobbly tax bases , a growing number of states are turning to lotteries . Since 1963 , when New Hampshire started the trend , 16 other states and the District of Columbia have legalized such games ; at least nine others are considering them. * The Public Gaming Research Institute , Inc . ( P.G.R.I. ) , projects that lottery ticket sales in 1984 will total $6.7 billion ( an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ) , up more than 26% from the 1983 sales record of $5.3 billion . About $2.1 billion of last year 's take remained in state treasuries , $2.6 billion was distributed in prizes , and more than $600 million was spent on administrative costs . <P> The games seem to have something for everyone : jackpots for the winners , commissions for the ticket sellers , and a politically safe way for legislators to raise revenue without raising taxes . In most states , lottery proceeds are channeled directly into the general fund . Typically , the largest share goes for education . Ohio 's Democratic Governor , Richard Celeste , for example , last week endorsed a bill that would earmark lottery profits for schools . <P> In Colorado , the most recent state to start a lottery , 40% of the take is allotted to a conservation trust fund . In Massachusetts , a share of the profits from the state 's high stakes Megabucks game is designated for the arts . Explains P.G.R.I. President Duane Burke : " If the choice is added taxation or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voluntary method . "
