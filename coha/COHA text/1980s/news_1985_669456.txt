To help them run as quietly as rustling leaves , these huge missile subs can use ' ' natural circulation ' ' nuclear reactors . Cooling water is sucked into the reactor , not by thumping pumps , but with currents created by engine heat. // Such technological tricks are what give the US an edge in the shadowy war beneath the seas . The US submarine fleet is still almost invulnerable , Navy officers claim - despite any secrets passed to the Soviets by the alleged Walker spy ring. // // ' ' There is no indication the Soviets have broken the code about how to detect our ( missile ) subs , ' ' says the Chief of Naval Operations , Adm . James D. Watkins. // US subs rely on sophistication because , as in most aspects of military power , they are outnumbered by the Soviets . The undersea fleet of the USSR consists of 357 combat vessels ; the US had 134 operational subs at the beginning of this year , according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. // The huge Trident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of US sub . Tridents carry 24 nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles aimed at the USSR , as well as torpedoes . Four Tridents are now on patrol , with two more in sea trials . The Navy plans to field 15 of these behemoths. // The sea leg of the US nuclear triad is rounded out by 31 smaller missile submarines of the Lafayette class , each of which carries 16 ballistic missiles. // The Navy also has four subs outfitted with cruise missiles and a grab bag of 95 attack subs . The attack subs , in wartime , would protect US ships and chase Soviet surface ships and subs ; to upgrade this force the Pentagon is now designing a futuristic fast-attack boat , the SSN-21 , for deployment in the 1990s. // The US undeniably has fewer subs than the USSR . But in undersea warfare numbers are not the only things that count. // The size gap ' ' is bad , but I think we tend to overplay the numbers too often , ' ' admitted Adm . Kinnaird R. McKee , director of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing on March 21. // For one thing , the US Navy plans to use attack subs as lone wolves , sent out to tie up concentrations of enemy forces . If a US sub ' ' isn ' t outnumbered , he has gone to the wrong place , ' ' said Admiral McKee. // And while the newest Soviet subs are faster , and dive deeper , than US counterparts , US subs are far more quiet . To US naval officers , stealth is the most important virtue a submarine can have. // US sub turbines are mounted on rubber shock absorbers . Some pumps , such as those on the Trident reactor , have been augmented by ' ' natural circulation , ' ' which requires advanced alloys able to stand sudden temperature extremes. // On patrol , US subs even avoid predictable patterns . They make random turns literally dictated by throwing dice , or a random-number generator. // How safe does this make them from Soviet detection , especially in light of the fact that the USSR may now be privy to some sub communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends ' ' much effort ' ' on trying to determine if sub patrols are detected , and that as far as the Navy knows , the Soviets can ' t do it effectively. // A government source with experience in antisub warfare claims privately that even US sonar planes , far more advanced than their Soviet equivalent , find it ' ' impossible ' ' to locate US subs. // In general , antisubmarine warfare is a difficult , sometimes baffling business . It emphasizes electronics and delicate sensors , things the US builds better than the USSR . But the vagaries of the deep still have a way of confounding the most expensive computer. // ' ' I ' ve always said sub tracking is more art than science , ' ' says an Navy antisub officer now serving a Pentagon tour of duty. // The mainstay of US antisub defense is the venerable P-3 , a turboprop plane jammed with more electronics than a small computer trade show. // Navy P-3s patrol the oceans from bases all over the world . They drop patterns of sonobuoy listening posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that give a sub away . When they think they ' ve pinpointed a sub , they dive down low to try for a positive reading with the magnetic-field detectors sticking out of their tails . In wartime , they would drop depth charges or torpedoes at an identified enemy. // The Navy also uses antisub , sonar-equipped ships and helicopters and has an officially secret string of listening posts on the seabed at such key choke points as the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap . Navy P-3 pilots pride themselves on being able to detect not only that a submarine is around but which particular submarine it is . Oscilloscope patterns can show a pattern from a distinctively unbalanced propeller , for instance. // But ocean conditions can play havoc with readings . Water layers of differing temperatures can distort sound waves , making a submarine 100 miles away sound nearby. // Typhoon-class subs are apparently equipped to operate through soft spots in the Arctic ice . If they do become floating bastions operating north of the Arctic Circle , the US can find them only be sending other subs after them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-ice operations . Two US subs , the Gurnard and the Pintado , operated under the polar icecap for seven weeks last year , according to recently released congressional documents. // The chancy game of sub tracking may be aided in the future by nonacoustic methods , add experts , such as blue-green lasers , and satellite detection of the minute surface ripples caused by passing submarines . **22;42450; <> **44;42474; **42;42520; **42;42564; **42;42608; **42;42652; <> **76;42696; **48;42774; US and Soviet combat submarine fleets <> <> **76;42824; **28;42902; **48;42932; US <> **48;42982; USSR <> <> **76;43032; **28;43110; **28;43140; Diesel <> **28;43170; Nuclear <> **28;43200; Diesel <> **28;43230; Nuclear <> <> **76;43260; <> <> **76;43338; <> Ballistic-missile <> **26;43416; 0 <> **26;43444; 35 <> **26;43472; 14 <> **26;43500; 65 <> <> **76;43528; <> Cruise-missile <> **26;43606; 0 <> **26;43634; 4 <> **26;43662; 18 <> **26;43690; 49 <> <> **76;43718; <> Attack <> **26;43796; 4 <> **26;43824; 91 <> **26;43852; 136 <> **26;43880; 75 <> <> **76;43908; <> <> **76;43986; <> Total combat <> **26;44064; **26;44092; <> **76;44120; <> force <> **46;44198; 134 <> **46;44246; 357 <> <> **76;44294; <> Percent nuclear- <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> **26;44554; 52. 9% <> <> <> <> <> Source : International Institute for Strategic Studies// //
