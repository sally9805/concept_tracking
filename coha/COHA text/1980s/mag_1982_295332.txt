Reagan says that he may compromise , but not very much <P> " Suggest something and we 'll take a look at it . " So said Ronald Reagan at his press conference last week , in what seemed a conciliatory , almost inviting gesture . For members of Congress traumatized by the prospect of enacting the President 's fiscal 1983 budget , which projects a $91.5 billion deficit despite more politically painful spending cuts , Reagan 's coy hint of compromise was in welcome contrast to his previous " put up or shut up " attitude toward critics . Nonetheless , the President insisted , there should be no tampering with his plan to add $34 billion to defense spending and to cut $91.6 billion in taxes next year . <P> Reagan was steadfast on these two points . Said he : " We can not back away on national defense without sending a message to the world that would be very unwise . " As for the supply-side tax cut : " To abandon our tax policy now would be to give up the very fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thus seemed to retract some of the flexibility suggested by Budget Director David Stockman in testimony to the House Budget Committee two days earlier . Stockman rejected proposals that the Pentagon budget could be cut by more than $20 billion , but he gave no direct answer when asked about the feasibility of a $10 billion reduction . The Budget Director also recommended that Congress " take a second look " at other elements of the tax cuts passed last August. * <P> The President remains amiably unfazed by the deficit shock felt on Wall Street and Capitol Hill . He said that unfounded fears about fiscal policy were partly to blame for the high interest rates that are the main cause of the current economic crisis . He tried to allay Wall Street worries that the Administration wants to subvert the Federal Reserve Board 's policy of keeping a tight rein on the money supply , and thus refuel inflation . After a meeting with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker , Reagan used his press conference to call a halt to recent White House carping about the Reserve Board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have confidence in the announced policies of the Federal Reserve Board . The Administration and the Federal Reserve can help bring inflation and interest rates down faster by working together than by working at cross purposes . " <P> The White House hopes that dismay over the size of the deficit will keep pressure on Congress to cut domestic programs further . In order to hold the deficit to less than $100 billion in fiscal 1983 , which begins Oct. 1 , the Administration has requested $25 billion more in budget cuts . Reagan insisted last week that this well is far from dry . Said he : " The amount of money in the budget for ' 83 for all human and social affairs is a 4.5% increase over the 1982 budget . " This is not the case . According to Reagan 's budget , outlays for programs other than defense and interest on the national debt would fall from $438.7 billion this year to $424 billion in 1983.                    @
