In the absence of a good flow of orders from investors , securities dealers said the credit markets were dominated by the increase in the Federal funds rate to 16 1/2 percent during the afternoon . " The market seemed to focus on the higher funds rate and the large volume of Treasury securities to be sold next week , " commented Maury Harris , an economist at Paine Webber Inc . " Everyone is ignoring signs that would encourage higher bond prices , such as a slowdown in the economy and less inflation. " // In the Treasury bill market the higher funds rate helped increase the average rate for new three-month and six-month bills to about 14. 19 percent and 14. 04 percent , respectively . Last week the average rates were 13. 55 percent for three months and 13. 62 percent for six months. // // New Rate on Certificates // Starting today , the top rate that banks and savings institions may pay on new six-month money market savings certificates is 14. 29 percent , up from 13. 87 percent last week. // Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely this year . The three-month issue , for example , has ranged from 15. 6 percent in mid-January down to 12. 5 percent in late March. // The higher rate for Federal funds - overnight loans between banks - was worrisome to securities dealers because it is a signal that the Federal Reserve wants to make credit less available in the banking system to slow the growth of the money supply . The basic money supply , M-1B , consisting of currency and checking accounts , grew at an annual rate of 26 percent over the latest month. // Analysts were uncertain if the Fed would make reserves so scarce that the funds rate would rise above 16 1/2 percent , but several noted that excessive growth of the money supply could remain a problem for several weeks . Even if the money supply declines during the rest of April , they warned , the timing of Social Security payments could result in a large increase in the week ended May 6 . <> <> Reaction by Fed Seen // " The Federal funds rate is not as meaningful as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , " said Morgan Stark , a senior vice president at the Chemical Bank . He said the increase in the funds rate - from 13 1/2 percent in the week ended March 18 to 15. 55 percent in the April 22 week and about 16 percent recently - was " not an accident. " // Mr. Stark called the higher funds rate " a specific reaction by the Fed to rapid money supply growth in March and early April . " Analysts explain that in the weeks following rapid money supply increases , the banking system ' s need for reserves , or credit at the Federal Reserve , also rises . When the Fed is unwilling to supply the additional reserves , a higher Federal funds rate results as banks bid more aggressively for the money. // Besides a higher funds rate , dealers said , the Fed ' s desire to make bank reserves scarcer was shown by a drop in the level of nonborrowed reserves over the latest month and a slight increase in bank borrowings at the Fed discount window . <> <> Effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s willingness to let the funds rate increase was " encouraging for the long bond market " since it showed the central bank ' s determination to curb inflation by slowing money supply growth . Yesterday , however , they said few investors seemed encouraged enough by the Fed to buy bonds despite record high yields. // " Investors are confident that high yields are not going to disappear soon , " and they are willing to wait until next week , when the Treasury will sell up to $8 billion of new notes and bonds , one salesman said. // The dearth of long-term bond buyers was illustrated by the $250 million issue of Aaa-rated Michigan Bell Telephone Company ' s 15 3/4 percent debentures due in 2021 , which underwriters led by Goldman , Sachs plan to offer today at 98 7/8 to yield 15. 93 percent . Just a week ago , underwriters offered the Aaa-rated 15 1/8 percent debentures of Pennsylvania Bell at a 15. 25 percent yield. // Analysts noted that , although both issues are rated Aaa , the Pennsylvania issue is regarded as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markets // In the Treasury bond market , the bellwether 12 3/4 percent bonds due in 2010 closed at 95 3/8 to yield 13. 38 percent , just 3/8 point higher than the low for that issue. // In the corporate bond market , underwriters led by Merrill Lynch said they were offering $150 million of Aaa-rated Citicorp notes due in five years at a price of par with a 15. 3 percent coupon. // In the tax-exempt market , dealers doubted that California would receive any acceptable bids at tomorrow ' s auction of $150 million of bonds due in 1982-2006 because the state ' s interest rate limit of 9 percent is below current market interest rates . In the secondary market , analysts estimated that double-A state bonds due in about 15 years would yield around 10 percent , with higher yields for longer maturities. // Following are results of the Treasury ' s three-month and six-month bill auctions : <> <> ( 000 omitted in dollar figures ) 3-Mo .
