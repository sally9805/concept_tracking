The daring May 5 rescue of 22 gendarmes and a magistrate held hostage in a jungle cave by New Caledonia separatists was at first hailed as a brilliant coup for French security forces . Then came a dramatic reversal . Last week Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement , a Socialist , announced he had launched an investigation of charges that soldiers involved in the rescue operation had murdered two hostage takers and failed to provide medical care to a third , who later died of his wounds . All 23 hostages came through the ordeal unscathed . <P> The minister 's announcement came in the midst of campaigning for the first round of two-round legislative elections in France and triggered instant counterattacks from conservatives . " I find it absolutely lamentable that they want to use the army as a scapegoat , " said Jacques Toubon , secretary-general of the Rassemblement pour la Republique , headed by former Premier Jacques Chirac , who authorized the rescue operation before he left office in early May .               @ @ @ @ @ @
