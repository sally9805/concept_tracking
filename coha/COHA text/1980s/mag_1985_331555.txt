For the past 2 1/2 months , in a rolling offensive , the Vietnamese army has been hammering away at the Kampuchean resistance . Last week Hanoi 's forces laid siege to a key guerrilla redoubt in the Phnom Malai mountains . The Vietnamese fielded an estimated 36,000 infantrymen backed by artillery and armor against some 17,000 lightly armed Khmer Rouge fighters . <P> In response to the Khmer Rouge 's deteriorating situation , five members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , Singapore and the Philippines ) , which backs the Kampuchean resistance , demanded that the Soviet Union curtail its military aid to Viet Nam , estimated at $6 million a day . Prince Norodom Sihanouk , the nominal head of the resistance coalition government , warned that China , which invaded Viet Nam in 1979 , would teach the Vietnamese " a second lesson " if the guerrillas are pushed to the wall .
