DOCTORS ' ORDERS IN 1979 Brownfield Regional Medical Center , a small hospital in West Texas , lacked an obstetrician ? but when it tried to recruit one , the town 's five doctors angrily protested . With 80 percent of the county 's mothers forced to give birth elsewhere , the doctors did n't dispute the need for an obstetrician . They objected to the hospital 's plan to put the new physician on salary , which they called " socialized medicine . " ( Doctors in Brownfield and elsewhere have traditionally billed patients separately for each service , which tends to be more lucrative . ) To subvert the plan , the physicians wrote to the recruit , threatening to bar him from the local medical society if he came . He stayed away . They also threatened the hospital administrator with a boycott if the deal went through . The Federal Trade Commission learned of the doctors ' behavior and charged them with illegal restraint of trade . Only ' then did Brownfield 's physicians agree to abandon their threats . Doctors and dentists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical societies have traditionally dictated policy on business practices to hospitals , insurance companies , governments , and individual consumers alike . These dictates have covered all aspects of the business , ranging from how much doctors charge for their services to whether they can have offices in shopping centers . The doctors ' control has made health care one of the least competitive sectors of the economy and brought them great financial gain . Until the 1970s , this private rule was seldom officially challenged . Over the past decade , however , the F.T.C. has actively exercised its authority to prosecute restraint of trade and other illegal business practices in the industry , including price fixing , illegal boycotts , kickbacks , and deceptive advertising . But Congress may soon bring such prosecutions to an abrupt halt . Prodded by the lobbying and campaign contributions of organized medicine , Congress is considering an amendment to the F.T.C. reauthorization bill that would grant " professionals " an exemption from F.T.C. prosecution . Although the exemption , introduced by Representatives Thomas Luken , Democrat of Ohio , and Gary Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a term that has not yet been defined ) , the debate has focused on those pushing for it : doctors and dentists . Both the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association have supplemented their pleas with heavy campaign spending . During the 1982 Congressional campaign , the A.M.A. 's political action committee alone contributed more than $1.7 million directly to candidates , which was the highest of any PAC contribution . A Congress Watch study of campaign donations from January 1 , 1979 , when lobbying for the exemption began , and July 30 , 1982 , showed that the A.M.A. and the A.D.A . combined had directly contributed more than $2.3 million to House members , a figure that does n't include late-season spending sprees or indirect spending on behalf of candidates . Seventy-two percent of that money was given to co-sponsors of the exemption . Of the 219 Luken-Lee co-sponsors , 213 have received money from either the doctors or dentists . O RGANIZED MEDICINE 's brazen attempt to duck the authority of the F.T.C. is being fought from all sides . Even some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Journal , stress the need for its continued work in the health care industry . The very diversity of groups going to bat for the F.T.C. testifies to the costly anticompetitive effect an exemption would have . Fearful of rising health care costs , business groups , including a lobbying organization that represents 200 of the Fortune 500 firms , are fighting the exemption . So are labor unions and consumer groups . Opposition to the exemption is coming from inside the health care industry as well as from outside of it . Societies of nurses , medical technologists , optometrists , social workers , psychologists , and others all support the F.T.C. 's work . Given President Reagan 's zeal for curtailing federal agencies , one might expect the current Administration to support the A.M.A. 's attack on the F.T.C. But Vice President George Bush and other top officials have written Congress to oppose the Luken-Lee amendment . Even James C. Miller III , the Reagan-appointed F.T.C.chairman who has asked that his agency 's budget be cut and its powers restricted , opposes this reduction in F.T.C. authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the exemption is a terrible idea , " he says . " It would create a special privileged class of persons seemingly above the laws that apply to everyone else . " rr HE A.M.A. ARGUES that overzealous F.T.C. offi- cials have imperiled the quality of American health care by telling doctors how to practice medicine . The implication here is that scalpel-wielding bureaucrats have invaded the nation 's operating rooms to dictate surgical procedure . But judging medical competence is the job of state licensing boards . The F.T.C. has examined the medical profession 's business affairs , not its operating room conduct . The economic significance of health care should not he underestimated . In 1981 Americans spent $287 billion , close to 10 percent of the G.N.P. , to cure what ailed them , making health care the nation 's second largest industry . Given the potential for abuses of power , surely an industry of this magnitude should not be left to regulate itself . The F.T.C. 's activities in the health care industry fall into two main categories : antitrust enforcement and consumer protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has prosecuted cases involving anticompetitive restraints of trade . Until 1979 , for example , the American Society of Anesthesiologists deemed most forms of salaried employment unethical , keeping prices higher by forcing anesthesiologists to bill patients separately for each service performed . The F.T.C. brought charges against the A.S.A. , and the doctors changed their code . The F.T.C. also brought charges against the Michigan State Medical Society for threatening to boycott the state Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Medicaid plans in order to gain fee increases . The F.T.C. judge who heard the case estimated that the extra fees amounted to several million dollars . ( The medical society is appealing the F.T.C. 's findings in court . ) But the F.T.C. 's impact on the industry can not he judged by case histories alone , for like all law enforcement agencies , the Commission derives much of its effectiveness from its powers of deterrence . As a consumer protector , the Commission has monitored deceptive advertising and restrained health care costs by conducting market studies and issuing trade rules designed to increase competition . After a 1978 study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state statute that allowed drug stores to substitute generic drugs for name brands , at cheaper prices . About a dozen states later adopted such laws . The Commission also opened the way for cheaper eyeglasses when it issued a rule requiring eye doctors to give their patients written prescriptions so they could shop comparatively . Market analysts note that the F.T.C. ruling , combined with the technological developments it may have helped spur , account for a 20 percent drop in the price of glasses . Citing the F.T.C. 's record in both antitrust enforcement and consumer protection , chairman Miller dismisses the A.M.A. 's charge that the F.T.C. endangers the doctors ' ability to practice medicine : " For the life of me , I fail to see how bringing cases against price fixing , kickbacks , boycotts , fraud , and deception can be construed as actions that lessen the quality of care . " M UCH OF THE A.M.A. 's wrath toward the F.T.C. no doubt stems from the Commission 's victory in a recently concluded court case . In 1975 the F.T.C. filed restraint of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent doctors from advertising and from working as salaried employees of health maintenance organizations ( H.M.O. ? ) , prepaid medical programs designed to provide cheaper health care . Both A.M.A. restrictions kept prices higher by restraining competition . The case ended last spring in a four-to-four Supreme Court decision that upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the F.T.C. Throughout the court battle , the A.M.A. argued that the Commission lacks legal jurisdiction over the professions . Having failed to convince the courts , the A.M.A. is now pressing its case in Congress . The A.M.A. argues that it does n't object to antitrust enforcement per se , but the evidence suggests otherwise . Consider its specific argument . The doctors say that the F.T.C. 's antitrust enforcement threatens the quality of care since the Commission lacks medical expertise . Yet they also argue that they are willing to accept enforcement of the same laws by the Justice Department and the state attorneys general . But why would these agencies pose any less of a threat to the quality of care than the F.T.C. , since they too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.T.C. is least qualified to take action , but that it is most likely to do so . State law enforcement officials are too busy chasing thieves and murderers to worry about antitrust violations . And they lack the political independence to challenge powerful state medical lobbies . Although the Justice Department theoretically could take over the F.T.C. 's antitrust duties , a traditional division of labor between the two agencies has left the F.T.C. with more experience in the field . And neither the states nor the Justice Department possess the F.T.C. 's rulemaking and market-study authority . Forty-nine of the fifty state attorneys general signed a letter to Congress opposing the exemption , as did the head of the Justice Department 's antitrust division and five of his predecessors . The A.M.A. revealed its real intent ? antitrust immunity ? when it passed a resolution last spring that outlined a plan to seek changes in all antitrust laws , Lawyers argue that , if adopted , the changes would make antitrust cases against doctors almost impossible to pursue . The A.M.A. has both its own considerable political strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In. today 's political climate , federal powers in general , and those of " regulatory " agencies like the F.T.C. in particular , are held in low esteem . The Corn-mission , which greatly expanded its activities in the 1970s , recently has become the object of conservative backlash . Between the time of the F.T.C. 's creation in 1914 until 1979 , exemptions were rarely granted , and usually given only because other federal agencies ( the Civil Aeronautics Board , for example ) were established for monitoring purposes . But in the last three years , many special interests have successfully petitioned either for partial restrictions on F.T.C. authority , or total exemptions . If the doctors win , they 'll join soft drink bottlers and funeral directors in the F.T.C. alumni club . By riding this tide of antiregulatory sentiment , the A.M.A. has sold the exemption as legitimate deregulation , which it is not , In fact , much of the F.T.C. 's work might more accurately be called " law enforcement " than " regulation . " Rather than regulate , in the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deregulatory force , sweeping away the private restrictions of medical societies , such as the ban on advertising . Barring the F.T.C. from the health care industry would not deregulate the field , as supporters of the exemption suggest . It would simply return the market to an anticompetitive form of self-regulation . F.T.C. chairman Miller , a free market advocate who has spent his career fighting government regulation , points to the false billing . " I think I recognize deregulation when I see it , " Miller says . " Ladies and gentlemen , this ai n't it . " Although the bill 's chances of passing are strong , Congressional support may not be as solid as the 219 names listed as co-sponsors suggest it is . Some of the original Luken-Lee endorsers now say the bill was misrepresented to them and are withdrawing their support . Representative Dennis Eckart , Democrat of Ohio , is among them . " I signed as a co-sponsor because the bill was represented as being sound regulatory reform that would eliminate inefficient and duplicative regulation between the F.T.C. and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation would not protect consumers against abusive price-fixing and other anticompetitive and antitrust violations . " M ANY OF THOSE who originally backed the Luken-Lee amendment have shifted their support to a compromise offered by conservative Representative James Broyhill , Republican of North Carolina . Broyhill is no F.T.C.-lover . Like Miller , he has consistently advocated less government regulation . His plan is designed to assuage doctors ' fears of the F , T.C. overstepping its authority by specifying in law that the F.T.C. 's jurisdiction applies to business practices only , and that the state licensing hoards govern matters of medical competence . While it is true that questions involving business practices and those involving medical competence may sometimes intersect ( disputes over what procedures nurses are allowed to perform fall into this category ) , the Broyhill bill fixes the respective domains of the F.T.C. and the states in a way that gives state boards , and the doctors , the benefit of the doubt . The F.T.C. supports the plan . But although the Broyhill bill addresses what organized medicine claims to he its concerns , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complete market autonomy . The current battle over economic power is not a new one . In fact , the continuity between organized medicine 's behavior in the past and in the present is striking . In 1938 the Justice Department brought an antitrust suit against the A.M.A. for harassing H.M.O. employees . At that time , the A.M.A. responded by arguing ( unsuccessfully ) before the Supreme Court that antitrust laws did not apply to doctors . In 1979 the F.T.C. brought chargesagainst the doctors of a Pittsburgh hospital for the same kind of harassment of H.M.O. employees that had taken place decades earlier . And the A.M.A. is still making pleas for antitrust exemptions . With health care costs skyrocketing , it is important not to lose sight of what this debate is ultimately about : money . Removing the F.T.C. from the health care industry means a less competitive marketplace , and a less competitive marketplace means higher prices . That 's a move that American consumers can ill afford .                 @ @ @ @
