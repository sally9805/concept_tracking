The right not to work is upheld <P> And they shall beat their swords into plowshares . <P> - Isaiah 2:4 <P> To Eddie Thomas , a Jehovah 's Witness , his new job seemed " a grave contradiction . " He had been a steelworker in East Chicago , Ind . But in 1975 his employer , the Blaw-Knox Foundry &; Machinery Co. , eliminated his job and transferred him to an assembly line turning out tank turrets . Jehovah 's Witnesses are not strict pacifists , but they believe in taking up arms only in a holy war for Jehovah . Since the firm had no nonmilitary jobs to offer , Thomas felt obliged to quit . Until he could find other work , to support his wife and four children he applied to the state for unemployment benefits . A review board denied him a stipend , ruling that he had left his job " without good cause . " Thomas took his case all the way to the Supreme Court , and last week , after a five-year fight , he was vindicated . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana 's action violated the First Amendment 's guarantee of religious freedom . Forcing a worker to forgo a government benefit when he has acted on his religious principles is unconstitutionally " coercive , " wrote Chief Justice Warren Burger . " While the compulsion may be indirect , the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial . " The precedent cited by the majority was a 1963 case that upheld a Seventh-day Adventist 's right to unemployment benefits after she left a job that began requiring work on Saturday , her Sabbath . <P> Since one of Thomas ' co-workers was a Jehovah 's Witness who stayed on the job , reasoning that tank making was too indirect a form of taking up arms to be immoral , the court could have concluded that Thomas took advantage of the situation . Instead , the Justices defended Thomas ' broad view . " In this sensitive area , " wrote Burger , " it is not within the judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow worker more correctly perceived the commands of their common faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , Thomas , 41 , who now works for U.S. Steel , becomes eligible for $1,055 in benefits for the seven months he was out of work . The money will come in handy , since his family has expanded to eight children , but he insisted that the principle was the main issue : " I wanted to focus attention on individuals who are hurt when a company tells them to do something else . They can put you anywhere they want . Sometimes you ca n't work at a new job with a clear conscience . "
