WASHINGTON  --  The House , backing away from what some lawmakers called the " Vietnam syndrome , " voted to repeal a nine-year-old prohibition on U.S. aid to rebels fighting the leftist government of Angola . The action , which came on a 236-185 vote last night , represented the first time the Democratic-controlled House voted to repeal the amendment . The original measure had been passed amid concerns about American military and Central Intelligence Agency involvement in struggles in emerging nations . The Senate , which recorded its objections to the amendment as early as 1981 , last month added to the State Department authorization bill a measure to repeal the restriction . The House vote came as the legislators worked on a $12. 6 billion foreign-aid authorization bill . Final action is expected this week on the bill , which would restrict the administration ' s flexibility in Central America and would make military and economic assistance to Jordan contingent on that nation ' s willingness to enter into negotiations with Israel . The 176 Republicans who voted to repeal the Clark amendment , named for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined by 60 Democrats to forge what some legislators viewed as an important symbolic action . " It ' s time to trust the president of the U.S. , " said Rep. Robert Dornan ( R. , Calif . ) . Rep. Samuel Stratton ( D. , N.Y. ) , who sponsored the effort to repeal , said , " Why is it that only in Angola can American aid not be given ? " Repeal of the amendment would permit the U.S. to provide aid to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , known as UNITA . Under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi , UNITA has waged a 10-year struggle to topple the Cuban-supported Angola government . " It ' s time we stood up for UNITA and black freedom fighters , just as we have stood up for the freedom fighters in Afghanistan , " said Rep. Mark Siljander ( D. , Mich . ) . Democrats who opposed repeal argued that the action symbolized what Rep. Howard Wolpe , the Michigan Democrat who heads the Africa subcommittee , described as " further evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . " An American effort to win the withdrawal of more than 30 , 000 Cuban troops from Angola and to secure the independence of nearby Namibia was stalled after South Africa mounted a raid into Angola on May 21 . Republicans repeatedly have said that the Reagan administration hasn ' t any current plans to provide assistance to the rebels , but have argued for repeal to remove restrictions on the president ' s options . The Clark amendment , said Rep. William Broomfield ( R. , Mich. ) , " cripples our ability to work within the diplomatic arena . " Earlier , the House voted to allow the president to withhold the annual U.S. contribution of about $50 million to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities if he determines that China , a beneficiary of the fund , is practicing coerced abortion and sterilization or infanticide as part of a population-control program . The action came on a 289-130 vote . " Nobody wants to bash anybody , but this House isn ' t reticent about pointing out human-rights violations in other places , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should we be so genteel and concerned about ruffling feathers over the coerced abortion and coerced sterilization going on in China ? If something is evil , let ' s call it evil . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
