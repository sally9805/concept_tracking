 | Eight daughters who were tapped by their fathers to run the family business reveal the rewards and pitfalls of following in Dad 's footsteps . Although the boss 's son was once considered the only heir apparent to the family business , some daughters have lately begun to edge out their brothers in the race for power and success . In fact , one leading authority predicts that within 10 years , one half of all company ownerships passed on to family members will go to women . How are the bosses ' daughters faring as company heads ? Some admit their jobs are booby-trapped by loneliness , personal sacrifice , and mixed messages from Dad , who may be saying , " Take care of my company , but do n't forget to have grandchildren . " And those who worked in other jobs before  | going on the family payroll say their fathers are tough compared to former bosses . Success is earned , they say . There are no free rides . There are , however , many fringe benefits , and the eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reach the top faster in a family owned business than she can elsewhere . As the boss 's daughter , a woman is also better able to implement new ideas . She and her father may not always agree ? but at least she has his ear . Motherhood and heading the family company may not always be compatible . While five of the women we interviewed are married , only two have children of their own ? and one of them became a mother before entering the business . Since most majored in college courses unrelated to business , it seems their plans to join forces with their fathers were not made early in life . Another common denominator appears to be their attitude toward their jobs : They work hard , putting in an average of nine to 10 hours a day , and are wholly committed to company goals . But those who say their fathers are or were workaholics see the need for a more balanced life-style for themselves . Husband and family come first in their hearts , they say , then the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives perspective to their careers . MARCY SYMS , president and chief operating officer of the $230 million Syms Corp. , outdistanced three brothers who now work as vice presidents for her . The New Jersey-based retail clothing chain of 17 stores in five states was founded by Marcy 's father , Sy Syms , who serves as chairman and chief executive officer . " If a woman is lucky enough to have a parent who has created a successful business , she ca n't put her ambition on hold because she has brothers waiting in line , " Marcy says . Armed with a master 's degree in communications and apprenticeships in a variety of jobs including media buyer for a radio station , Marcy joined her father 's company in 1977 . Her talents were channeled into advertising , customer relations , personnel , merchandising , and the selection of new sites . She spearheaded a first for Syms ? the simultaneous opening of two stores in the Boston area , allowing the company to get double mileage from its marketing efforts . It was a big success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of a self-imposed five-year trial period , she was named president . Married to a senior analyst with a brokerage firm , Marcy , 35 , believes the way for a woman to succeed in a family  | business is to do her homework , be slow to recommend change , and realize it 's she , not her father , who must make adjustments in the relationship . " My father and I never had any real difficulties in business , " she says , " probably because we 've always communicated well and have respected each other 's privacy . But I had to learn patience . It took a while before he 'd accept my suggestions for change . In other words , I had to earn credibility first . " CAROLYN JOHNSON , president of United Welding Supplies of Houston , Inc. , joined her father 's company eight years ago out of necessity rather than ambition . A recent divorcee with two sons to raise , she realized she 'd probably be working the rest of her life ? and the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired her to handle inside sales for the same salary she was making as a secretary ? and he considered it too high . " We had conflicts in those days , " Carolyn admits . " 1 thought I 'd have more time to spend with my boys . My father argued that the business would have to come first . In the end , we compromised ? but it took time . " Carolyn 's father , Derrick Alsworth , retired five years ago when she became president . He remains active as chairman of the company that distributes high-pressure cylinders for industry , netting $2 million a year . Now 40 , Carolyn has remarried . Her husband works for a company that leases office equipment . Her 23-yearold son has joined her in the family business , and her younger son , 17 , also shows signs of becoming involved . The biggest problems for her have revolved around issues of divided loyalties . She says she has always been reluctant to take time off because she feels as if she 's taking money out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another company . A year ago , for instance , when her younger son was seriously ill and her time was split between his needs and her work , she felt guilty on both counts . " If I had n't felt I was responsible for upholding my father 's dream , I might have just chucked the job , " she says . " Sometimes I 'm plagued by the fear of failure and what that would do to my father . After all , this company is his baby . He raised it and did well by it . And now it 's in my hands . " KATE MEARNS is n't company president yet , but she 's being groomed for the job . For now she 's learning from the ground floor up by working as regional sales manager for her father 's Cleveland-based Security Products Company . It 's with chagrin that she admits she once sat in her father 's office and cried because he criticized her work . " I could have accepted criticism from another boss , " says 28-year-old Kate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take . " The disappointment apparently was short-lived . Her father , Bud Jones , chose Kate to open a Williamsburg , Va. , office , which generates East Coast business for the company that nets $3 to $5 million in sales of industrial fire- and burglar-alarm systems . Kate has no competition from her brother , a pilot . However , the younger of her two sisters works in the family business . " I suppose we could get into a power struggle at some time , " Kate says . " It 's not likely because I think we 're both comfortable with our roles in the company . Maybe it 's one of those things , like divorce , that you do n't want to think about unless you have to . " Kate and her husband , a financial planner and organizer of athletic media events , have been busy decorating their new house and expect their first child in May . She admits it has n't always been easy separating business and family , but she works at it . Kate started working for her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a prolonged postcollege bike tour of Europe , she joined the firm with the idea that she would ultimately handle the reins of the company . She says she thinks a boss 's son generally has an easier ride , and that , as a woman , she must constantly prove herself to clients . But she admits it 's fun to see their doubts fade when she comes up with the right answers to their questions . Kate believes she 'd be more goaloriented in another job ? on the lookout for the right move , financial reward , and important title . " Here , I ca n't get caught up with immediate prestige , " she says . " My goals are long-term , they change a lot , and they are based on whatever seems best for the company ? because , in the end , that 's what 's best for me .

Life could n't get much better ? right ? " Well , I 'm not complaining , " she laughs . " But I work hard for those fringe benefits . " Paula learned marketing in college and the chemical process of wine making at home . After a year of working for a veterinarian in Kenya , Africa , she settled into the family business . Although her brother , still in college , will some day join the firm , it is Paula who is destined to head it . She owes her edge to being the firstborn , but counters that her father probably thought it would be her brother who would take over . The moment of truth for Paula and father Hanns came after his stroke a few years ago . While he remains head of the company , his illness forced Paula into the front lines . " Until then , Dad thought of my job as a stopover in my life , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let go , and that he could depend on me . It hit me suddenly too ? the knowledge that he was n't immortal , that it would be up to me to carry on with his plans . " Paula 's management style differs from her father 's , and that , she says , can create conflict . She once brought it to her father 's attention that they had been using the same labels for 32 years and it was time for a change in design . Hanns had to agree . " He knew I was right , " she says . " But still , in a way , I was attacking his identity . The label was terribly symbolic . It was a learning process for me , changing that label in a way that would be respectful of everything my father stood for . " Paula looks forward to marriage and motherhood some day . " I grew up in this winery , and I do n't see any problem about doing my work with children underfoot . I can see myself changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . My mother did it , so I guess I can do it too . " MARSHA MARSON , vice president of New Can Company , Inc. , a Bostonarea company that grosses $12 to $15 million in sales of industrial filters , expects eventually to head the company . She went to work for a major accounting firm after finishing college , but soon became dissatisfied , wanting more control over her future . So , five years ago , she approached her father , David Marson , president of New Can . " Dad offered me a spot in the family business , " she says . " Of course , I had the idea , but I wanted the suggestion to come from him . " During her years with the company , Marsha , now 30 , has been trained in all aspects of the business . Her most difficult hurdle ?  | " It sounds silly , I know , " she admits , " but in the beginning I anguished over referring to my father as ' Dad ' instead of David . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings , I 'd be sure to make direct eye contact , so I would n't have to use his name . " Aware that men often are intimidated by a woman who will one day run a successful company , Marsha says marriage is n't in the immediate future . She says she sometimes thinks her father has mixed emotions about her role at New Can . " He has faith in my ability and I know he 's excited about my opportunities in the company , " she says . " But then , he looks at the burdens he 's carried all these years ? the struggles that go with heading a company ? and he does n't want to pass them on to me . " NANCY ( NANA ) LAMPTON RAY , 44 , is chairman of the $8 million-a-year insurance firm where her father , Dinwiddie Lampton , Jr. , still serves as president . Twenty years ago . when she first came to work for her father at American Life and Accident Insurance Company of Kentucky , it was difficult for her to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nana saw her chance , not only to succeed in the enterprise founded by her grandfather , but to make her mark on Louisville 's future as well . She quickly graduated from opening mail and making coffee to jobs with more responsibility and , before long , a vice presidency . But there were troubles along the way . " My father did n't think I had to be taught the business , " she says . " He expected me to cut out my own niche . And yet when I did , he was n't necessarily pleased because it was my way , not his . " Through the years Nana has expanded American 's role in the community , serving on the board of directors of a local bank , raising money for the opera and other cultural projects , and spearheading a mammoth " re-creation " of Louisville that draws on the talents of civic leaders . " Dad knew what he was doing , pushing me to prove myself , " she says . " 1 became American 's link to the community ? thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company . " Nana 's two brothers were once active in the company , but both eventually chose to go into other businesses . On the whole . Nana believes women may be better suited than their brothers for involvement in the family business . " The entrepreneurial nature is such that it 's difficult for anyone to give up the reins of a company he has guided for a lifetime , " she says . " Somehow daughters seem to accept the paradoxical situation of being both in control and not in control . " Married to an attorney , Nana has two stepsons . She admits she has fought hard to retain her private life , and that her first marriage suffered because of family-business pressures . She 's fortunate now , she says , to have an understanding husband who is not threatened by her divided loyalties . All in all , she believes the family business has been good to her . " I suppose I 've given up a chance to say I 've done it all on my own , " she surmises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for me , a happily balanced life . " MARILYN KELLEY , 34 , is the president of a Chicago , Ill. , company that sells flour and dried dairy products to bakeries , netting $5 to $10 million annually . Her father , Donald M. Kelley , is chairman of the board . Just seven years ago Marilyn was in California , working for an educational-films company . When she realized it was n't she but the boss 's daughter who was in line for the top spot , she started talking to her own father about joining the family business back home . " I think I shocked him with the suggestion , " Marilyn admits . But we did n't rush into anything . In fact , we talked it over for nine months . " At the end of that time , Marilyn joined Kelley Flour as vice president ? but not before insisting on a written agreement detailing the lines of responsibility . Marilyn says she never had conflicts with her father because neither ever personalized their business disagreements . Although her brother and sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is she , as president and major stockholder , who is heir to the business founded by her grandfather . Still single , she wonders how she would juggle family and career . A maternity leave would be impossible , she says . But she strongly believes a woman can have it all and that , in her case , she might arrange child care in the office or set up an office in her home . But child care is not an immediate problem . " A woman in my position is vulnerable on two counts , " she says . " Certainly many men are threatened by women they consider too powerful . But there are other men whose interest may be motivated by dollar signs . Fortunately , they do n't account for the entire male population , but they do limit choices . " Explaining that one of the disadvantages of her job is that she ca n't take long vacations , Marilyn also realizes she has more personal freedom than she could expect at another company . For me , " says Marilyn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , and taking responsbility for them . " CYNTHIA ROSS TROTTER , now sales manager of Ross Equipment Corporation in Cleveland , expects one day to replace her father at the helm of the near $3 million-a-year company . Claiming that being a daughter in a family business is rough on marriage , 31-yearold Cindy appears to have found the perfect solution : She 's married to a man who works with his father in a carleasing business . " It helps that he understands the dynamics , " she says . " But it 's still difficult for any husband to contend with the intense relationship that develops between a father and daughter in business . " An only child , she went to her father , Gregory Ross , eight years ago and asked him for a job . " I was working in a travel agency at the time , " she recalls , " watching people go off on exotic vacations when I could n't afford the bus fare to Dayton . " Convincing her father she could sell cranes was one of the toughest sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on his role as a protective father , " she says . " He was afraid I would n't be accepted because this is a male-dominated business . " Gregory Ross remains president of the company , and Cindy believes he will continue some involvement until she takes over . " I should have moved into administration long ago , " she admits . " But I love sales . " That 's one of the advantages , she feels , of working in a family business . In another company , she 'd be sabotaging her career by avoiding a loftier title . But in her father 's firm she can remain at the head of the sales team , while developing spin-off companies and expansion to other states . Cindy says her father is more critical of her than of others in the company . In the beginning , she interpreted that as his way of saying he did n't want her there . But she came to learn he was judging her by the high standard he had always set for himself . She sometimes wishes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father . " 1 can remember trying to make a point by quoting my economics professor , " she says , " And Dad would remind me that my professor never ran a crane company . "
