Before they ever left the locker room , the Cincinnati Bengals threw the challenge to the surfers from the West Coast , the guys accustomed to playing their football wearing short sleeves in San Diego . " Once we saw the weather and the wind , " said Bengal defensive coordinator Hank Bullough , " we decided to take the wind and give the Chargers the ball ( on the coin toss ) and see what they could do with it . " The answer turned out to be virtually nothing . The Chargers , the most explosive team in the NFL , the team that had scored at least 17 points in every game they ' d played this season , literally froze in the AFC championship game yesterday . In the second-coldest playoff game in NFL history ( minus-9 degrees , with a wind-chill factor that reached minus-59 ) , the Bengals proved the tougher team in every way , bouncing the Chargers out of the playoffs , 27-7 , before 46,302 zany loyalists who had the heart to show up at Riverfront Stadium . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing their team play nearly perfect football to earn its first trip to the Super Bowl . " To beat Cincinnati , " said San Diego defensive coordinator Jack Pardee , " you have to make their offense turn the ball over with fumbles or interceptions . We didn ' t do that . Teams that beat them this year did so by creating turnovers . We just never did it , and they got some big ones from us . " In a way , this game came down to a man-to-man confrontation between the quarterbacks : the Chargers ' Dan Fouts vs. the Bengals ' Ken Anderson . Anderson won the duel as he directed his team flawlessly , never losing his poise under pressure . Fouts did not display the same composure . He killed two straight San Diego scoring bids by throwing interceptions - one into the end zone and another to the Cincinnati 5 . " Those two interceptions hurt us the most , " said Fouts , who completed 15 of 28 attempts for 185 yards . " With this wind today , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t be sure where the ball was going . " Fouts , who had been the trigger man for the Chargers ' record- setting offense all year , really didn ' t do a thing to help his team this time . The San Diego score came when Kellen Winslow ran 33 yards with a Fouts screen pass in the second period , but Winslow ' s running , not the pass , made the play work . Before and after this isolated burst , Cincinnati was in charge . " They jumped on us at the beginning , " said Charger coach Don Coryell , " and we never really did get back into the game . We kept making critical mistakes . We are capable of playing a lot better than we did today , but give them credit - they played the much better ballgame . " Coryell pointed to an unusual occurrence in the first period that he felt helped Cincinnati take a quick 10-0 advantage . " We had to go into the wind ( gusting up to 26 mph ) , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of the field open , " he said . " That made it all the tougher . I ' m not saying that someone intentionally left that door open , but when we faced the same thing in the second half , the officials stopped the game until it was closed . " The Bengals shut the door on San Diego in a hurry . On this frigid afternoon - only the Dallas-Green Bay playoff on Dec. 31 , 1967 , had been played under colder conditions - they showed they meant business right from the start , driving for a 31-yard field goal by Jim Breech and a 3-0 lead on their first possession . San Diego ' s James Brooks promptly fumbled the ensuing kickoff , and Cincinnati ' s Don Bass smothered it at the Charger 12 . On second down , Anderson hit M.L. Harris over the middle for an 8-yard TD and a 10-0 lead . Now came the lone San Diego scoring thrust of the day , pulling the Chargers within 10-7 . " I think the key point in the game came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We took the ball going into the wind and drove for a score . It was one of the better drives we had all year . " Certainly none was more important . It started when rookie David Verser returned the kickoff to his own 45 . It ended seven plays later when fullback Pete Johnson banged in from the 1 for a 17-7 Cincinnati advantage . Anderson set up the score with consecutive passes of 15 yards to Charles Alexander and 12 yards to Cris Collinsworth . Then Fouts tantalized San Diego followers by twice driving the Chargers close before making fatal mistakes . Throwing deep from the Cincinnati 33 , he fired the ball to Cincinnati ' s Louis Breeden at the Bengal 5 . On the very next drive , this time to the Cincinnati 21 , Fouts ' pass into the end zone was hauled in by the Bengals ' Bobby Kemp . Cincinnati finished off the Chargers in the second half . Breech kicked his second field goal , a 38-yard shot with the wind at his back in the third quarter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth period to lock it up . Afterwards , there was as much talk about the weather as there was about the game . " No championship game should ever be played under these conditions , " said Chargers owner Gene Klein . " I ' m going to try to see to that from now on , these conference championship games are played at neutral sites . " " We didn ' t let the weather bother us , " countered Bengals linebacker Reggie Williams . " The coach ( Gregg ) talked to us before the game and told us not to let it become a factor , and we didn ' t . " Perhaps nobody could appreciate the conditions more than Gregg . He was an All-Pro offensive lineman at Green Bay under Vince Lombardi , who once said , " Weather is all in the mind . " " I played in that real cold game we had with Dallas for the championship ( in ' 67 ) that everyone still talks about , " said Gregg . " I think that game was tougher to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ( actually , the temperature in Green Bay was 13 below ) , but the field here today was in much better condition . The field in Green Bay that day was frozen . I thought both teams executed well under the conditions . They ( the Chargers ) just made more mistakes than we did . " In contrast , Anderson made no mistakes . He completed 14 of 22 passes for 161 yards , and for the second week in a row , he did not throw an interception . " His scrambling hurt us , " said Pardee . " He ran some when they beat us earlier in the year in San Diego , but he hurt us more ( five carries for 39 yards ) today with it . " Naturally , the Chargers beefed about the weather . But they headed back home knowing one thing . They lost in San Diego on a beautiful day , 40-17 , during the regular season . They lost yesterday in this Midwest Arctic , 27-7 . When the margins are 23 points and 20 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the Super Bowl . " Football , " said Coryell , " has always been a game to be played under any conditions . Today was no different . "
