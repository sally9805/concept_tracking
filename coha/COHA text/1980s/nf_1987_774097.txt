Suddenly , at twenty-eight , the already obese young man with a tinge of Negroid ancestry in his features , found himself the day 's most celebrated dramatist , ranked with his great friend Hugo . Indeed the two were often feted together as the " two rivals . " After both political and literary ups-and-downs , the dizzying success of Antony inflated Dumas 's inherent self-confidence . He had charming manners , was well-set up , very much a dandy , and by no means as gross in appearance as he was to become . He had a thick head of hair and non-African blue eyes which twinkled above his cocky mustache . He triumphed with countless women after he abandoned his mistress Melanie Waldor .

" He managed to gather in his modest apartments Paris 's greatest painters : Delacroix , Nanteuil , and the Boulanger cousins , who were all among his personal friends . Dumas Pere was a famous collaborator and depended heavily on his assistants . His play La Tour de Nesle was received with raves as a fashionable melodrama , but drama , as a form , was leaving the forefront of French literature for the novel : de Vigny 's , Hugo 's Notre Dame de Paris ; Balzac ; Merimee ; Zola . Recognizing this trend , Dumas made a thorough study of the craft of Walter Scott and concluded correctly that there was a fortune to be exploited in the realm of fictionalized French history . Since his experience with the little-known Swede , Leuven , he had found it convenient to work in tandem with other writers and started his new endeavors with the collaboration of Frederic Gaillardet , Jules Janin , and Auguste Maguet ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far his most successful partner ) . He even worked in tandem with the eccentric poet Gerard de Nerval , who sometimes strode the boulevards dragging a lobster on a leash , other times pulling a piglet with the pope 's face painted on its pink behind . The Musketeers series was as well known in Britain as in France and was a favorite of Andrew Lang , William Thackeray , and Robert Louis Stevenson . At the height of his glory , in one year ( 1844 ) Dumas completed a second great romance twelve volumes long The Count of Monte-Cristo . Of all his novels there is no doubt that those he accomplished with Maguet were the p 51 best . Maguet , however , was never alone able to approach his collaborator 's talent . Evidently to satisfy his vanity while at the same time developing an assembly-line method of producing books , Dumas meticulously copied out in his own handwriting all those portions of his manuscripts written by collaborators .

At twenty-eight he was already considered the greatest dramatist of his time , and he was as highly esteemed as the far more talented Victor Hugo . This boundlessly zestful man had no scholastic pretensions , despite the fact that most of what he dealt with pretended to relate fact . " What is history ? " he inquired boastfully . " Oh , it is the nail on which I hang my novels . " In all French literature there is nothing comparable to his quantitative production ( with or without helpers ) during the decade starting with 1845 And most of his works were prodigiously long ; many were continuations of each other ; and some were occasionally repetitious , spanning an intensely active period from the sixteenth century to the termination of the French monarchy .

" And again , two years later : " Put a piece about me in your periodical with the Academie in view . I am not on the next list of candidates , but feel pretty sure that people are surprised that I am not . " He never was accepted ; but neither was that more finely honed talent Zola . Nor , this century , were Proust , Gide , Sartre , Malraux . During the 184os , when Dumas 's career was at its zenith , he made countless enemies among jealous rivals , with his bragging , his flaming waistcoats , his penchant for blazing decorations .

After composing at feverish speed his book based on that name , he Decided to celebrate his triumph by building his own " Chateau de MonteCristo " on a property he had already leased at Saint-Germain-en-Laye to which he had transferred the famous Comedie Franfaise theatrical troupe . Subsequently , he changed his mind and constructed an identically named Renaissance chateau " in an " English park " near Bougival . There he lived like a grand duke .

One listener allegedly said : " But , my dear sir , it was n't like that at all . We were there . " Dumas replied cheerfully : " All I can say , General , is that you did n't pay attention to what was going on . " As both novelist and short story writer Dumas Pere continued his extraordinarily popular " cloak and epee " romances right through the middle of the nineteenth century , piling new intrigue on old intrigue and adventure on adventure , so that his originally youthful daredevil characters gradually aged in print . Even the young gallant d'Artagnan became a mature musketeer officer , and Porthos , one of the famed three musketeers , died heroically .

He was enthusiastic over the 1848 revolution and unsuccessfuly sought an electoral post in the department of the Yonne . In 1853 he established a daily , Le Mousquetaire , devoted primarily to literary and artistic criticism . This was succeeded four years later by Monte-Cristo , another journal . The Goncourts wrote of him :  | Dined yesterday with the Princess ? a company of literary men , among them Dumas . A kind of giant with a negro 's hair now turning " pepper and salt , " the small eye of a hippopotamus , bright , shrewd and forever on the watch even when the lids are half closed , and all this in an enormous face , the features of which are vaguely hemispherical , like those the caricaturists give when they portray the moon with human characteristics .

Old Dumas was still lively enough to conquer a young American actress , Adah Isaacs Mencken . She had been married three times already before she wedded him , contending it was " love at first sight . " Two days later she sailed away and , after a serious illness , died in 1868 . Dumas Pere lingered on three more years . His output had been so prodigious that he was wholly or partially responsible for ninety-one works . He wrote plenty of trash and forgotten , picayune trifles , but his vivid , dashing tales are still devoured by the youth of innumerable lands . It is hard to see how this obese bundle of brash energy had time to tumble from dinner to dinner and bed to bed in perhaps the most brilliant , liveliest Paris of all time .

But how will our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trilby is associated with Paris during the gay , wastral , scandal-ridden Third Republic period , the French-born Englishman , du Maurier , had less talent and less personality than the bumptious , witty younger Dumas . Dumas Fils recalls of his mother : " Happily my mother was a good woman , and worked hard to bring me up . " He also acknowledged his father 's true quality , writing : " By a most lucky chance he happened to be wellnatured and as soon as his first successes as a dramatist enabled him to do so recognized me and gave me my name . " Later , when the generous Marie endorsed this act to help him along the path of fame , she had also to confess she was unmarried in order to make the inheritance deed legally valid under a complex law . Many , many years later , long after the father had deserted his former mistress , who was currently living a model life , Dumas Fils suggested the two old people formally marry . She wisely and modestly refused , writing a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailing and live very simply with one servant . Monsieur Dumas would blow my little flat to pieces . It is forty years too late . " For decades these famous roues , known to each other as well as the entire beau monde of Paris as Dumas Pere and Dumas Fils , shared similar lives and affections despite the age gap between them . The father wrote his offspring : " When you , too , have a son , love him as I love you , but do not rear him as I have brought you up . " The younger said : " My father is a great big child whom I had when I was a small boy . " There were striking similarities between the two writing Alexanders . Both were burly , bloated men with slightly Negroid features . Both bustled with energy and had successes with many of the leading beauties of their time . Both suffered from prejudices : Pere more from the Negritude of his features ; Fils from the broadly advertised stigma of his illegitimate birth . Physically as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic strain from the unlucky general who founded their literary dynasty and was both so muscular and so unfortunate , yet bore up against unwarranted injustice . Dumas Fils , despite an acid wit , had none of the exuberant literary talent of his father . Indeed , had he never met an exceptional beauty of modest upbringing , an actress who called herself Marie Duplessis , one evening when he was seated in a front-row box overlooking the stage , his entire career could well have been otherwise and the world might never have known his talent . p 55 The two were precisely the same age ; both born in 1824 . She had worked at a dressmaker 's ( clearly a Dumas family hunting ground ) and swiftly struck that section of the Parisian audience marked by Parisian rakes : the Contades and Delesserts ; the rich aristocracy and gentry . She possessed graceful , natural manners and had carefully educated herself , reading the fashionable classics and mastering uncomplicated piano compositions . And her beauty was outstanding . Dumas Fils wrote : " She was tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white complexion . She had a small head and elongated eyes which had the enameled look to be found in the women of Japan . But there was in them something that indicated a proud and lively nature . Her lips were cherry-pink , her teeth the loveliest you could have hoped to see anywhere . " Dumas Pere later described how his son introduced him to this ravishing conquest . One evening while attending a routine performance of the Theatre Francaise , he felt a hand reach out of the door of a box , catching his coattails . It was Dumas Fils . " Come in here for a moment , Father , " his son said . " I opened my eyes . An adorable young woman of twenty , or twentytwo , was alone there with Alexander and had just bestowed upon me a far from daughterly greeting . I recognized her from having seen her more than once , in front ' on stage . She was Marie Duplessis , the lady of the camellias . " The father instantly saw that this ravishing girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " She was one of the last of those rare courtesans who had a heart . " But it was evident to his experienced eye that the cost of keeping her in style would ruin his boy , who had little income . Maurois , the excellent French biographer , who commendably leafed through truckloads of dossiers at Villers-Cotterets , assembled many amusing facets of her character . When a friend asked why she had such a passion for lies , she said , " They keep the teeth white . " She was forced by the inescapable law of the courtesan to shift from one wealthy lover to another in order to maintain her wardrobe and her reputation . Dumas Fils wrote her in 1845 : " My Dear Marie ? I am neither rich enough to love you as I would wish , nor poor enough to be loved by you as you would . Let us both , therefore , forget ? you , a name that can not mean very much to you , I , a happiness that is no longer possible for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , it has been said , " she had become so indifferent that she gave no more thought to the day 's love than she did to the morrow 's passion . " She came to know tout Paris , from Franz Liszt to the Comte de Perregaux , whom she married in England . Finally , afflicted with tuberculo sis , she died at the age of twenty-three , amid the frenzy of carnival in 1847 . Two months later the only one among her lovers who had made the name Marie Duplessis famous rented a tiny room outside Paris and reread her letters . Ignoring French literary fashion , which favored recounting love in poetry , Dumas Fils used prose and produced an autobiographical novel . The Lady of the Camellias was a success but only achieved its full acclaim when he rewrote it five years later . Dumas Fils accepted his splendid triumph in a different spirit than his father . Writing came hard for him . Having lost his taste for courtesans , he had an unhappy love affair with Nadejda Knorring , widow of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gossip-prone Paris was delighted . The Goncourt Journals recount : This evening , at the Princess 's , we were treated , for the first time , to a taste of young Dumas 's wit . There is zest in it , somewhat on the coarse side , which nevertheless , always strikes home : ripostes which cut everybody to ribbons without any consideration for good manners : self-assurance which amounts to insolence and gives to all he says a sort of success : most noticeable of all a cruel bitterness . . . but , beyond any doubt , a humor stamped with his own personal mark , mordant , cutting , with plenty of " zip " ? a great deal better to my mind than what he puts into his plays , because of its economy and its improvised sharpness . There was passion but rarely companionship in his sexual relations . He once confessed : " All that adultery amounts to is , for the woman , hatred , and for the man contempt . So what 's the point . . . . The novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those impressions . " These bitter thoughts do not accord with the general impression of champagne bubbles and elegance usually associated with Dumas Fils . Indeed , he held disastrously pessimistic world views . He foresaw an incomparably vast war between West and East . In many respects his visions transcended those of Jules Verne : huge explosions shattering cities ; mines hurling whole landscapes into the sky . Young Dumas was much more profoundly thoughtful than his father . Yet the two remained close , affectionate , and proud of each other . The offspring admired his parent : " He is what he is without realizing it . That is the sign by which one recognizes men of real , natural genius . Even if a lecher who misused his energies was an undoubted aspect of the man , he was a good man and a generous writer . " p 57 There was a congeniality in their opposite personalities . " I find my subjects in my dreams ; my son takes his from real life , " said Dumas Pere . " I work with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he photographs . " To my mind there is no comparison between the best works of Dumas Pere and Fils . Invention , imagination , has to most literary ages ( not our own ) an advantage over acerbity . Although the son had a more acute intelligence than the father , it was unable to compensate for the lack of the ungloried invention possessed by the father . Early in 187o Dumas Pere , an aged and almost forgotten figure , left Paris for the Midi . When he reached Marseille , he first heard of the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War . Maybe because so much of his life had depended on illusion , the news of initial French disasters crushed his soul . Weakened by a stroke , the lovable old man arrived in the Puys de Dome and rang his son 's doorbell . " I have come to you to die , " he said . Dumas Fils , greeting him warmly , reported : " My father was brought to me completely paralyzed . It was a painful sight . Beware of women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A different credo from that upon which he himself had risen to fame . ) There is little doubt that the stronger personality of the pair , Dumas Fils , handled the sad denouement with dignity . On December 6 , 187o , he wrote George Sand : " My father died yesterday , December 5th , at ten o'clock in the evening , without pain . You would not be to me what you are if I did not send this news , first of all , to you . He loved and admired you more than any other woman . " That great mistress of distinguished men answered from Nohant , April 16 , 1871 , the moment postwar communications began to resume on a normal basis : " You are reported to have said about your father : He died , as he had lived , without noticing . ' I do n't know whether you did actually use those words , or whether they have merely been attributed to you : but here is what I wrote in the Revue des Deux Mondes : His was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of death ' ? which means the same . " It is fascinating to speculate about the three generations of this family . Dumas Grandpere might easily have entered history as a great hero , a second Bonapartist Marshal Ney . But misfortune and bad luck twisted him into a mediocrity , something abhorred by Napoleon . Dumas Pere loomed as a brilliant storyteller , but not a literary giant to be compared with Hugo , Balzac , or Stendhal . Dumas Fils was a one-work author ? of the mawkish play and novel The Lady of the Camellias . But he was a charming companion , and the most profound and original thinker of the family .  | ' The Only U.S. Field Marshal : Arthur and Douglas MacArthur Throughout history there have been various kinds of hereditary professions . These have generally been royal and known by the last name or titular seat of the original great chief who founded the lineage : thus , the Habsburg , Hohenzollern , Valois , Ottoman , Orleans , Tudor , and Romanov " dynasties . " But the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applied to extremely wealthy titans : the Rockefeller , Ford , and Mellon dynasties in the United States . On and off for centuries , there have also been military families whose scions were trained to command . Among them have been Prussian Kleists , French Condes , and American Lees and MacArthurs . Of this last category the most famous in the United States ( if but briefly ) was the MacArthur dynasty . Although it included only two members , both generals , father and son , each was renowned for his prowess and his personal valor . The younger MacArthur , Douglas , was certainly one of the most contentious professional soldiers who ever fought . Although sneeringly referred to as " Dugout Doug " by many of his troops , his fearlessness , dash , and sangfroid were remarkable , and he was well known for personally seeking out risk and danger while quite unarmed . He is never reported to have flinched , save at sea ( an element with which he had an inherent physical disagreement ) . It is well to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having escaped to Australia from the Japaneseoccupied Philippines on the specific orders of Washington , halted the enemy advance in Papua and then started his gradual but accelerating sweep back northward to Tokyo as commander of all Allied forces in the southwest Pacific . It was an immense theater. p 59 During this wartime period Churchill invited a young British friend of mine to dine at Chequers , the prime minister 's official country residence . My friend was fascinated by an immense globe of the world , painstakingly marked out and embraced by an intricate glass device that could calculate in miles and fractions thereof all terrestrial measurements . Puffing the glow of his customary postprandial cigar , Churchill showed by the gleam in his eye how pleased he was to glimpse his guest 's puzzled attention . " Remarkable device , " the P.M. said " We could n't get it into Number i o Downing Street , where he officially resided in London , so we brought it here . " With little effort for an elderly man , slightly lubricated by brandy , he then pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny Union Jack . " There , " he announced with a satisfied resonance , " we have the headquarters of Admiral the Lord Mountbatten , in charge of Allied forces in Southeast Asia . " Now have another look , " he said walking carefully around the bulging , rotund map , following the complicated plexiglass circumference machine with its neatly marked-off distances and smoothly moving adjustable gadgetry : " Way down here on the right you can see another little marker . This one is the Stars and Stripes . The flag of the United States of America . Command post of General Douglas MacArthur , Allied chief in the vast arc of the southwest Pacific . " He stared through his spectacles at the magnifier on which emerged the numerals 6,600 . " Sixty-six hundred miles apart , " he announced with satisfaction . " Tell me , do you think that 's far enough ? " There was awed silence at this huge testimonial to Allied might ? and problems between prima donna chieftains ? at the peripheries of what so many thought of as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young guest had been parachuted behind German lines and been killed by a sniper 's bullet . Not only Churchill but many others matched this remarkable pair of rival heroes who barely knew each other , came from different nations and contrasting circumstances , but had about them a genteel and romantic sense of battle , an ability to exploit fate and handle men . Mountbatten ? tall , lithe , and exceptionally handsome , with an enchanting wife and , as far as can be known , few adversaries except the Enemy ? had the inherited advantage of royal blood , close connections with what was then still the world 's greatest empire , and a splendid tradition in Britain 's finest service , the Royal Navy , one of whose destroyers was sunk under his feet . MacArthur had few tangible assets but the personality he was born  |p6o  with . His were the relatively modest ties with the distinguished upper strata of a far-from-jingoistic and socially democratic society . Yet he too was physically well-endowed , a bit shorter than the admiral but lean , fit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular calisthenics regime , he managed to retain almost until death the figure of an athlete ? which he was not . Mountbatten was a dynast by advantage , inheritance , and wealth . MacArthur was a military dynast in a country and era that had largely discarded the old-fashioned " service families , " used to contributing at least one of their sons each generation to fight on because it was the tradition of their upbringing . Yet , outside of Britain , Germany , and Japan the species had largely ceased to exist . The first MacArthur in the United States who distinguished himself as a warrior was Arthur , who earned the Medal of Honor as a lad during the Civil War battle of Lookout Mountain . He was subsequently commissioned in the postwar Union Army in 1900 until discharged as Philippines Commander by Secretary of War Elihu Root . It is odd indeed that both father and son should receive the greatest symbol of glory our nation can give and also eventually be assigned to command the Philippines ; even odder , without doubt , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his immediate superior in Washington and , but a half century later , the son was bluntly eliminated from all and any commands he held , above all in Japan and Korea , by tough little President Harry Truman , who worshiped no dynasts of any variety . Both Arthur and Douglas MacArthur demonstrated during their terms of Filipino office that they understood the Asians they administered and were admired and loved by them in a striking paradoxical way when contrasted with the disputes and debates that ensued among the Americans who had originally posted them there . Both had a rare un-Caucasian lack of racism and were revered by Orientals who were irksomely accustomed to the boorish arrogance of high-ranking whites with their exclusive clubs and assumed air of superiority . Douglas MacArthur was brilliant and versatile : probably the best American general since Robert E. Lee , although the worst presidential aspirant with a military background since Lee 's battlefield adversary , U.S. Grant . He was the only American who ever served as dictator of an entire nation ? the Philippines ? where he was also the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was brilliant , persuasive , and p 61 endowed with magnetic powers to charm . From West Point plebe to five-star general , his record was outstanding . His appearance was dashing , his mind clear and quick . He became absolute ruler of Japan , effective superior to the emperor , and a curious twentieth-century version of the former political system of the shogunate . The reality of his true power was shown when the emperor , Hirohito , claiming divine descent , first called upon the victorious U.S. commander after the war ? not vice versa . But he proved to be a highly benevolent and popular despot . MacArthur understood the Japanese in a strikingly intuitive way , as he also did the Filipinos and the Koreans . Perhaps Douglas had learned something psychological about Orientals when his father , dismissed from Manila , was assigned as an observer in the Far East and wangled a job for him as a traveling aide . But why should the son later dream of becoming president of the United States with three equal powers : executive , legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well but misjudged it , more than once . He imposed democracy on Japan , a defeated power ; yet undefeated America , which was inherently democratic , never took to him politically . An additional paradox is that he , the top enemy , proved himself to be the most popular man in Japan . The very aspirations of his character that won him esteem and affection there were abhorrent to most Americans . In fact , at no moment did he ever stand a true chance of being freely chosen head of the U.S. government . His Asia First policy earned him far less votes than Roosevelt 's Europe First , of which Dwight ( " Ike " ) Eisenhower became the symbol and Marshall the architect . It is unseemly to imagine this of a fine and honorable man ; nevertheless , he was probably at least partially prodded into his lamentable efforts to seek the White House in order to put his thumb in the eye of Truman , who had dismissed him during the Korean War , and in that of his former aide , Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary . I knew Eisenhower well and can vouch that the dislike was reciprocated . The American people in the mass preferred Eisenhower to MacArthur , just as they preferred Eisenhower 's war theater , Europe , to MacArthur 's Pacific . Moreover , there is reason to believe that despite his successful career , Eisenhower was a man wholly untainted by ambition even if this very fact may have jaundiced MacArthur 's view of him . The concept that Ike regarded himself as a civilian in uniform ? both as an army officer and during his eight years in the White House ? won him the  | love of his countrymen more than the theatrical MacArthur 's ostentation and handsome fearlessness . General Ike used to say of the man whom he served as an aide in Manila : " I studied dramatics under him for five years in Washington and four in the Philippines . " If Eisenhower was a grown-up version of Tom Sawyer , MacArthur sought successfully to be his country 's beau ideal as a soldier . A handome , lean youth from the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career . He indulged a taste for elan from those days in World War I when he was America 's youngest general officer , and donned a uniform costume suitable to his aquiline features : muffler flung about his neck , bent wire framework shaping his cap , like that of a World War II fighter pilot . Later he took to stressing the informality of his simple shirts and trousers and to clamping a homely corncob pipe in his firm , clean-cut jaw . Arthur MacArthur , whom Douglas greatly admired , was not bred to be a soldier , although he was descended from a hardy Scottish clan with bellicose traditions . His own father was named a federal judge by President Grant , in 187o , and he served the cause of civilian justice until his death in 1896 . Young Arthur 's call to the colors came through the circumstance of fratricidal war . His northern upbringing placed him in the Twenty-fourth Wisconsin Infantry Division . With this unit , in Tennessee , he was commissioned a first lieutenant when he was only seventeen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year later . From then on , like his more famous son , he was renowned in the army for dauntlessness and superb egotism . In fact , Arthur became so outrageous in his behavior that Secretary of War Root relieved him of all Filipino commands in igoi . Although Root has vanished into anonymity and never had a chance to be president , the circumstances of the dismissals of father and son are indeed striking . Douglas and President Truman were even more different personalities than Arthur and Secretary Root . The theater of the second dismissal , during the Korean War , was on a far vaster stage ; yet both events were tense drama . Douglas MacArthur was a blatantly intelligent man , melodramatic , patriotic , immensely attached to his family . He always said of the night his dad died : " Never have I been able to heal the wound in my heart . " Yet , in fact , his mother probably had more influence on him than did Arthur , and did all in her power to flagrantly advance his career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the military academy.Here p 63 there is a strange , if limited , resemblance between young MacArthur admiring his ambitious father and at the same time asking his lovely mother to further his promotions through influential friends , and the early relations of Winston Churchill with his parents . The general 's maternal plantation forebears and snobbery infected the son , for whom the mother cherished such ambition . She summoned all her social connections to push for his promotion . In 1917 she wrote Secretary of War Baker : " I am deeply anxious to have Colonel MacArthur considered for the rank of Brigadier General . . . . Cordially yours , Mrs. Arthur MacArthur . " When he failed to reply she wrote again : " I believe the entire Army , with few exceptions , would applaud your selecting him as one of your Generals . " She also wrote General Pershing , not an enthusiast for her boy : " emboldened by the thought of old friendship for you and yours and with the knowledge of my late husband 's admiration for you and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am most anxious that my son should be fortunate enough to receive one of these appointments . " Quite clearly Douglas approved of his mother 's servile attempts to advance him by appealing to high authority . Following graduation from West Point and after touring the Far East with his father ( incidentally earning the unhelpful dislike of the subsequent general , George C. Marshall ) , he led a dashing raid on Vera Cruz during the 1914 Mexican-border troubles . He was consequently recommended for his Medal of Honor , which he did n't receive for three decades . During World War I Douglas MacArthur performed with distinction , ability , and inventive audacity , earning more decorations for gallantry than any other U.S. officer . MacArthur proved his cool courage ? and was not simply a competitive , inspiring leader who felt he could get the most out of his men by being seen in front of them . He was wise , without fear , and blessed with great intuitive instinct . But in his younger days , he also displayed a damaging capacity to make powerful enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he undoubtedly suffered from three blazing weaknesses : vanity ( which as Virgil tells us is the root of evil ) ; overweaning confidence in his own judgment at the expense of wisdom proffered by others ; and ? a blemish not uncommonly found in great men ? the tendency to misjudge the value of those he selected to surround him and to advise him . Many of his immediate counselors were a poor lot . Few among MacArthur 's entourage had enough self-confidence to venture to display grade " A " qualities . His staff was larded with odd  | characters who favored a dictatorial government in Washington , and , against this background , one wonders if one should not read deeply into the observation of Ambassador Clare Boothe Luce , no shrinking violet herself : " MacArthur 's temperament was flawed by an egotism that demanded obedience not only to his orders , but to his ideas and his person as well . He plainly relished idolatry . " Indeed few doubted his military genius . Winston Churchill called him " the glorious commander " ; Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war produced , " Viscount Montgomery described him as " America 's best soldier " of World War II . After MacArthur 's Korean crisis , Churchill called the American " a fearless military leader whose daring was feared by those who profited by it . " He suggested that his critics should instead " pay deserved tribute to the legendary service of a great soldier . " Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke , chief of Britain 's General Staff and probably its most brilliant , if acerbic , soldier , confided to his diary that MacArthur " outshone Marshall , Eisenhower and all other American and British generals including Montgomery . " Emperor Hirohito 's staff considered MacArthur 's maneuver into Bataan from beleaguered Manila and Corregidor a " classic , a great strategic move . " General Pershing , whose voice had never been friendly , dubbed it " a masterpiece , one of the greatest moves in all military history . " Pershing added later : " It is not often given to a commander to achieve the ideal of every general ? the surrounding and annihilating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has achieved this three times in the last eighteen months . " Pershing referred to the Kokoda-Milne Bay campaigns , the Bismarck Sea operation , and the operations around Lae and Salamaua as the Americans struck back at the Japanese with deadly venom . Nevertheless , the admiration for MacArthur among Asian leaders and the adulation for him among the Oriental masses tended to exceed that tendered to him by most American leaders and , in political terms , ordinary people . In part this was probably derived from the general U.S. impulse to look toward Germany and Europe as the great threat , even though west of the Rockies , the popular slant perceived greater danger in the Pacific . MacArthur 's achievements in the Orient , considering what he received in the form of limited material and manpower , is miraculous , despite mishandling of his air force when the surprising assault was launched at Pearl Harbor . The latter error was perhaps abetted by the confusion and incompetent communications between Washington and its system of intelligence interpretation and dissemination . p 65 MacArthur 's broad range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swift and well-prepared strategic advantage as well as its ability to select key base positions and seize them before America or its allies were ready for any kind of counterattack . The general 's Southwest Pacific theater was at no time allotted so much as a fifth of the national war effort . Eisenhower 's troops landing in North Africa were provided with fifteen tons of supplies per man , thrice that granted in the Pacific . MacArthur led only twelve percent of all Americans sent overseas to fight . Of course , at the start Allied strategists wholly misled themselves . They considered a Pearl Harbor unimaginable . By June 1942 the Japanese , at war just six months , had wiped out all resistance in the Philippines except a cluster of lesser guerrillas and had actually reached across the Pacific to seize two important islands from American Alaska . Yet , from his new short-lived headquarters in Brisbane , Australia , the unflappable MacArthur had mapped out the course and method of his reactions . In August the First U.S. Marine Division hit the fringe of New Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general had already calculated the formula for his reaction : In Papua ( South New Guinea ) he decreed : " We must attack , attack , attack . " This was to be a war of airborne logistics with planes carrying fighting men , ammunition , and guns . These troops served him immutably to move forward the bombardment line . Through dripping , dank , sweaty jungle , his forces fought their way northwestward , bypassing key points ( like Rabaul ) and thus sealing off the Japanese . During the more than two years that elapsed between MacArthur 's arrival in Australia from his Filipino island fortress of Corregidor and the time of his return to the Philippines , he lost fewer casualties than Eisenhower did in the Normandy invasion . Within two years the Southwest Pacific commander 's soldiers had fought back almost two thousand miles against a tough enemy aided by a jungle-covered , sea-girted , craggy terrain . In Adelaide , Australia , MacArthur had told the press : " The President of the United States ordered me to break through the Japanese lines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American offensive against Japan , a primary object of which is the relief of the Philippines . I came through and shall return . " He did . Ile began this triumph by troubled thoughts in the 1930s as field marshal of the Philippine forces responsible to the Manila government . He was already predicting that within a short time " total war " based on " maneuver and movement " and " command of the air " would face the world .  | his field marshal 's post . This almost doubled in pay and allowances the yearly sum he would henceforth receive from Washington . On May 18 , 1950 , in Tokyo , MacArthur expressed the following views . He obviously did not foresee the Korean War , which came the next month and got near to being global when the Chinese intervened . He told me : The basic reason I have for concluding that there will not be a war soon is because of the changed nature of war . The scientists of the world have developed in such an extraordinary degree the processes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationally a means of settling international problems . Its destructiveness has become so great that there can be no winner . Both sides lose . It is almost a form of mutual suicide . Therefore it is not an acceptable rationalization as a means of settling international quarrels . In this respect you have to remember that war at the beginning was a sort of gladiatorial contest . You might start with the basis of the fight between David and Goliath . From such an individual contest it became a struggle of professional units fighting gradually in more obscure corners of the world . But the results of these military engagements were accepted in peace treaties by the governments represented by these armies , and therefore at least some results were accomplished . However , as the world became more closely integrated , war became a more total concept involving every man , woman , and child and for settling of quarrels . The opinion of the masses of the world is against it . That is a relatively recent development , and it is true of all the masses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , if you look back , you find that international wars were invariably preceded by a period during which one or the other side ? and sometimes both sides ? became prepared and believed that if they were successful in war they would triumph thereby . They looked upon war as a short cut to power . Thus , always one side or both sides were relatively prepared not only in the sense of military force but in a psychological sense ; public opinion approved , and that was of great importance . At the present time that is not the case . The public realizes all too well in terms of the last war that there can be no real  | victory in a future war . Therefore , on neither side is there psychological preparation . The Russian masses are probably just as opposed to a shooting war as the Anglo-Saxon masses . Therefore , many incidents have taken place during the last few years which in the past would have led to war but which have been passed over . I do n't believe that war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor would they be willing to permit it . That goes for both sides . That is the basic reason for my belief that war is not upon the doorstep . A dubious confidence on the verge of the Korean conflict , which became almost global . We know that we do not intend to start an aggressive war . We have no such thought in our national mind , and we are only preparing defensively in case of a tragic emergency . It is quite possible that the Russians are preparing in exactly the same way . Russian propaganda indicates their belief that we are preparing an aggressive action . Therefore the Russian is also arming defensively . But there is no indication on either side of preparations for an aggressive , offensive war . Furthermore , I think it is foolish to assume that the Russian would start an aggressive war now . He is doing so well under the present no-shooting war that he would probably and logically wish to continue the present successful system . It is a rare thing , in sports or anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Soviet is patient . He thinks in terms of decades or centuries . He is not an Occidental but an Oriental . He is white , he is partially located in Europe ; he has our gregarious instincts . But at heart he is a tatar . He is like Genghis Khan . It is an Oriental trait to be patient . They deal in decades or centuries . This is against our nature . When we want a thing done , we want it done right away or tomorrow . But the Russian will lay down a railway that he wants to use in twenty-five or fifty years . We must never forget that Asia includes perhaps 1,250 million people and maybe sixty percent of the assets of the world . Yet it has the lowest standards of living perhaps in the whole  | world . It is manifest destiny that the effort of future civilization will largely be an Asiatic problem devoted to raising the standards of that huge area . I wish there was more effort to face the fundamental problem of doing away with war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the problem of abolishing war . Yet the United Nations continually asks for its own armed forces . It talks of fighting to maintain the peace . That is a ridiculous anachronism . I am a hundred percent disbeliever in war . As is the case with many military leaders , MacArthur carefully cultivated an appearance and personality that would inculcate his ideas of leadership in those he encountered . Of exceptional intelligence , with a mind that showed its finely honed qualities from West Point days onward , he was not only an impressively attractive if , on occasion , autocratic figure but his presence and manner showed an extraordinary and magnetic quality . He always seemed at ease and relaxed ? but in a feline manner , ready to spring . He cultivated an easy informality symbolized by his corncob pipe and clothes that would have been rumpled if less well pressed . He had a sympathetic smile ? although not outgoing or toothy ? and a gentle , thoughtful way of talking in a well-modulated voice . He was always under full control of himself without appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask is extremely difficult to assess . Some have said he was a " Mama 's boy , " referring to the dominant mother . MacArthur seemed to make rather few mistakes in individual human relations , but those he did make were costly ? as , for example , the two I have mentioned : in the instances of Marshall and Eisenhower . His relationships with the public at large were remarkably effective , although some of his own press officers privately disliked him . He successfully cultivated a chosen personality with which to present himself to his armies and to the world ? as did the earlier and more imperious Napoleon and Wellington . Indeed , General Douglas MacArthur made remarkably few mistakes in the immensely grave issues of war and peace itself , and , despite blots , his record was dazzlingly positive . The first vital episode in a negative sense was permitting his air force to be destroyed on the ground by Japanese planes ? nine hours after word had reached his headquarters of the Pearl Harbor disaster in Hawaii . Especially because of his admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery . his second blazing mistake was the total inability to foresee a North p 71 Korean attack in the spring of 1950 . Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes charged that MacArthur had been caught wholly unprepared by that event , a theme later echoed by President Truman . And his final basic miscalculation was that the drive northward to the Yalu River and China 's frontier , after his dazzling Inchon landing in Korea , would not provoke an armed Chinese reaction . Before pursuing the consequences of the last error , it would be wise to recall and to stress again these days the social and economic effects of the revolution he personally imposed on Japan , after he had flown into Yokohama totally unarmed , following the world 's first nuclear bombardments and the total surrender to him and the Allied powers . One year later , in 1946 , a constitution he had devised became the governing law of more than 8o million militant Japanese . MacArthur , regardless of flaws , was a great man , and great men change the structure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese constitution , drafted and enacted under MacArthur 's supervision , class and hereditary privileges were abolished and the militant Shinto religious discipline rejected . Agricultural reforms placed more than ninety percent of the land in the hands of those actually farming it . A formidable new structure of civil liberties , trade unions , and equal rights for women was written into the code of governance . And he did his best to outlaw war effectively by demilitarizing belligerent Japan , a policy later reversed by Washington . Obviously , these good intentions have been modified by ensuing fact , especially in the realm of militarism . As long ago as 1950 , W. J. Sebald , MacArthur 's chief State Department adviser , sniffed that it was unrealistic to think of Japan as an unarmed " Switzerland " of the East and that MacArthur 's was a foolish dream . But , although Japan has started back along the road of newer , better , and more forces and weapons in recent years , as the result of unanticipated American prodding , it has stuck to its antinuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixed ( but predominantly American ) international force . The experiment underscored the difficulties of such commands . President Truman said the objective of the United Nations in Korea was " to restore peace there and to restore the border . " However , a U.N . resolution subsequently called for " the complete independence and unity of Korea " ? quite a different thing , considering that the country was geographically , politically , and ideologically bisected in a de facto sense . Even Secretary of State Dean Acheson , hardly a MacArthur enthusiast , acknowledged that the free world and South Korean forces could n't just  | advance " to a surveyer 's line and stop . " MacArthur himself was inclined to caution . He played the follow-through on his Inchon landings with delicate skill . He well recalled from his young days as his father 's aide that in 1904 Russia had made a Japanese attack across the thirty-eighth parallel ( now dividing the two Koreas ) the casus belli . In fact , he was never given precise orders on what to do . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall 's secret cable to MacArthur ? " feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel " ? with the U.N . commander 's equally secret reply ? " Unless and until the enemy capitulates , I regard all Korea ( North as well as South ) as open for our military operations . " He was still sticking to the limitations fixed by Washington as interpreted by the secretaries of defense and state . He even proposed that South Korean soldiers should remain southeast of the Yalu 's delta , despite the impetus of his remarkable Inchon flanking operation . Yet the General Assembly ordered him to conquer North Korea . To be fair to the general , despite the adulation he had justifiably received for military genius on the road to Tokyo and political vision when charged with governing Japan , he was brought down by confusion . Marshall cabled saying Truman wished to confer with MacArthur in the Pacific that October ( 1950 ) . On modest Wake Island , the general discounted the chances of intervention from China or the Soviet Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman firmly forbade an attack on Chinese bases in Manchuria and rejected MacArthur 's project to widen the war in any way . However , he endorsed the general 's denial of a sanctuary to the enemy across , the Yalu . After the Wake conference , MacArthur prepared an air bombardment to sever the Yalu bridges . On November 6 , 1950 , he was directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington to defer bombing targets within five miles of China 's border . When MacArthur pointed out the military illogic of this instruction and demanded the right of hot pursuit as Chinese troops drove across the Yalu , George C. Marshall , Dean Acheson , and Truman himself approved . But our U.N . allies objected . American policy was reversed , and MacArthur 's career was doomed . He fell back cleverly , minimizing potential losses . The public stormed ? not against the international and national confusion that simultaneously condemned and protected his reputation , but against him . Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen told me MacArthur had " made a terrible mistake " in p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese entry into the war . The brilliant diplomat David Bruce felt the general should have worked for " a fixed line in Korea and a neutral zone . " The argument has lapsed . Many ? including myself ? have shifted from one opinion to another . But Truman really did n't help things , except for proving the authority of civilian rule in America , when he fired MacArthur from all his commands , barking : " The son of a bitch is n't going to resign on me . " And the general foolishly , unsuccessfully sought to challenge the president . In March 1955 I spent an evening in a large circular wooden bathtub in the southern port of Pusan with South Korea 's defense minister , Admiral Sohn Won II ; Foreign Minister Young Tai Pyun ; and General Chung Il Kwon , chief of staff . They all agreed MacArthur had made two crucial mistakes . He split his command so that chaos resulted when the Chinese punched a hole between the halves ; and , refusing to contemplate possible Chinese intervention , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Ridgway , MacArthur 's successor , said the general had misinterpreted intelligence about China and showed bad judgment by predicting the U.N . forces could n't hang on ? as , under Ridgway , they did . Truman complained that any armistice hopes had been wrecked when MacArthur " openly defied the policy of his commander in chief , the president . " But Field Marshal Montgomery observed from the sidelines that generals are never given adequate directives , which had been the case with MacArthur . Shortly before yielding his NATO command to run for the White House , MacArthur 's private bete noire , Eisenhower , told me in Paris : " MacArthur 's recall has served one very useful purpose : it has certainly proved to the Russians that we are not arming with aggressive intentions . They can have no illusions on that score now . " Despite sour remarks among intimates concerning his former boss 's vanity and ambition , Eisenhower always publicly praised MacArthur 's military talents . It was an odd and somewhat pitiful sight to witness the last contest between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political aspirations , but , as the symbol of victory in a " Europe First " and pro-NATO policy thoroughly endorsed by the Democrats and proven victorious in the field , he and his infectious grin plus his natural diplomatic tact made him an obvious candidate for the Republicans , eighteen years out of the White House . MacArthur , carried away by his own glory , was already making less and less of a secret of his final , if supreme , postwar ambition . As  | early as 1943 , Roosevelt 's personal chief of staff , Admiral William D. Leahy , had noted : " If General MacArthur should get the nomination he would be a very dangerous antagonist for anybody , including Roosevelt . " But , despite his enormous appeal abroad , MacArthur never developed a political following at home . Roosevelt once told him : " I think you are our best general , but I believe you would be our worst politician . " This was confirmed in 1952 . Before the Chicago Republican convention , MacArthur boasted to the American Legion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a U.N . seat to Mao Tse-tung . Yet he never got anywhere except with the far-out right . In the Wisconsin primary , MacArthur won only eight delegates against Harold Stassen 's nineteen . When he finally showed up at the convention , he looked tragically old , fumbling , surrounded by little known has-beens who never , in fact , were . He was given the honor of making the keynote speech . I wrote at the time : " He said nothing but sheer baloney . One could feel the electricity gradually running out of the room . I think he cooked his own goose and did n't do much to help Taft " ( Eisenhower 's chief party rival ) . Eisenhower , of course , won both the nomination and the election . Four years later , in 1956 , two Democratic leaders worked hard to get MacArthur 's public backing for Adlai Stevenson against Eisenhower . All he did was say in private : " If Eisenhower is reelected president , it will be the greatest disaster in American history . I know just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf courses and the trout streams of the country , and then he will just disappear . There wo n't be any American government at all . " Later , after Jack Kennedy 's election restored the White House to the Democrats in 196o , he called on MacArthur , who said : " All the chickens are coming home to roost , and you are living in the coop . " In the spring of 1964 , he developed severe kidney and liver failure . His last known act was a plea to President Lyndon Johnson to stay out of Vietnam . Then , on April 3 , 1964 , after having reversed a formula he made famous from an old army song , he first faded away and then , in a peaceful coma , died . The end was sad , bitter , and meaningless for a man who had seen so much triumph and served his nation so brilliantly . But he took great glory to the grave with him and added much luster to the splendid name of his renowned father . Together the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short-lived American empire in Asia . They were excellent soldiers , but only one , the son , ventured into the unknown field of politics ? disastrously.  | Both were splendid generals who were dismissed by civilian officials with whom they had disagreed . Each was admired for his courage and personal independence . Both were involved ( as observer and as enemy ) in the last two major wars of Asia , with Japan against this century 's superpowers : first Russia , then America .  | Two Tudors : Henry VIII and Elizabeth I Henry VIII , most brutal , most flamboyant and most intelligent of the Tudor kings of England , bequeathed his three heirs an extraordinary legacy : the finest education available at a time when the full Renaissance was starting to flourish in the British Isles ; a burgeoning navy ; a nationalistic and divisive religious policy ; and sadly unhealthy constitutions , which may very well have been tainted by hereditary syphilis . Henry was certainly afflicted with that disease . There seems little doubt that his sickly son and heir , King Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1553 ( some alleged it was of consumption ) , had many symptoms not related to tuberculosis , including eruptions on his skin , loss of hair , then of nails , and finally a disintegration of his toes and fingers . There was surely something wrong with Henry 's health , something that could be passed on by heredity , and his children , legitimate and illegitimate , displayed symptoms of an odd and unpleasant sort . Each of them , including the immortal " Virgin Queen " Elizabeth , suffered particular maladies at the normal age of puberty . Mary experienced a false pregnancy after marrying King Philip II of Spain . But , although Henry VIII was an extraordinary , cold , callous , and infinitely licentious man , he was also a monarch of great brilliance who began life with immense hopes . His father , Henry VII , who ended the War of the Roses with his victory at Bosworth Field in 1485 , did his best to heal the wounds and desolation that had riven England , and was far-sighted enough to recognize the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice that , having established his own reign by force , he could well foresee that an improved system of governance over the long term was essential for the health , wealth , and stability of his kingdom .  | Henry V III was the first English monarch to be educated under Renaissance influence , which in itself was an important factor in the development of his own curiously complex and by no means benign character . His tutors included the leading English poet of the time , John Skelton , whose blunt verse displayed unabashed prejudice against the Scots , who were eventually to inherit the United Kingdom when the Stuarts took over in 1603 from the childless Elizabeth . Apart from the brutality and cold wickedness of Henry V III , one must give him credit ( thanks to his father ) for perhaps the best regal education bestowed by a king upon his heir since Philip of Macedon hired Aristotle to teach Alexander the Great . His was really in some ways a personality closer to Macchiavelli 's realpolitik portrait of a " Prince " than the insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later renowned in history for his numerous courtships , six wives , and heartless brutality , it should never be forgotten that Henry VIII , when he came to the throne in 1509 , aged eighteen , was already an omnivorous reader , a linguist fluent in four modern and two classical tongues , a musician and composer , a keen historical scholar , and a determined promoter of institutionalized learning . It is certainly arguable that without this cultural tradition given by his father to Henry VIII , a cruel but versatile and far-seeing monarch , Renaissance England might not have benefited from the works of Hans Holbein ( Henry 's German-born court painter ) and ? under his highly educated daughter Elizabeth ? from John Donne , Francis Bacon , or William Shakespeare . For better or worse ? and there are those who speak for each side of the argument ? Henry allowed his lusty sex life and quest for a legitimate son , added to the concept of Reformation ( which was then an increasingly powerful ideological factor in Europe ) , to incite him to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the Church of England , and in the end to discard the Catholic Catherine of Aragon , daughter of the Spanish king . He then took on successively an astonishing series of official wives ( who were therefore titular queens ) in search of legal male heirs . This maternal marathon , with its contrapuntal theme of beheaded queens who had been discarded , is one of history 's more unpleasant episodes . But the Church of England ( with its overseas branches whose methodology and doctrine differ little from Rome 's even if the sovereign of the United Kingdom is not acknowledged as a religious symbol ) is a vigorous and far-from-stagnant theological force today . Henry was in fact cool to Protestant dogma but was anti-Rome and insistent that state should dominate church .  | The Tudor dynasty was both brief and melodramatic , yet , despite its short duration and its often bestial brutality , its 118 years ? especially those dominated by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I ? are studded with factionalism , violence , gore , theology , naval strategy , and creative artistic genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferment added greatly to the permanent heritage of Britain and the English-speaking world . It is an interesting phenomenon that faction or partisan groupings and opinions should have played an especially powerful role during the short , dynamic Tudor regimes . Lady Margaret Beaufort , mother of Henry VII who won his throne on the battlefield , had strong views on this as described in a great sermon given about her by the Bishop of Rochester , John Fisher . He recalled : " If any factions or bands were made secretly among her head officers , she with great policy did bolt it out , and likewise if any strife or controversy , she would with great discretion study the reformation thereof . " As David Starkey , the British historian , points out : " This , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , is the first use of the word faction ' in English . " And yet Henry VII gained his crown only by employing the strongest factional force to obtain it after royal rule had virtually dissolved under Henry VI , Edward IV , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over , sought to destroy factionalism as a political factor and asserted his central financial influence to weaken the great lords while at the same time maintaining as much distance as possible from individual government and court functionaries . He stood apart as a rather remote spectator from entertainments staged in the royal name . Having seen the dangers of exaggerated factionalism and the example selected by Bishop Fisher , he divided the medley of court servants and then created a powerful Privy Chamber headed by the Groom of the Stool , whose main personal duty was to attend to and watch the sovereign 's performance of excretory needs . This proved to be an effective way of generally insuring royal privacy and keeping the monarch 's distance . Henry VIII roughly terminated this discretion and hauteur . His very first action was to have two of his father 's most trusted ministers beheaded . He then broke up the subtle division of powers his father had arranged to strengthen the sovereign 's position against any scheming rivals and did away with the recently reconstructed past . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of a single , small executive council which almost immediately split into factional disputes between the eager advisers of Henry VII , led by the Bishop of Winchester , and the Earl of Surrey 's bellicose war party . Hs next break with the past came the year after his accession when he  | personally took part in a tournament at Richmond , wounding his opponent . He thus swept away the ban on royal participation in court entertainment . He stuffed his Privy Chamber with personal friends and made the Groom of the Stool a boon companion instead of a semianonymous , menial servant . The upshot of these rapidly accomplished changes was that the king himself became the target and cynosure of factional attention . Henry VIII thus , before he was twenty , accomplished what was simultaneously a political revolution in governance and a social revolution in aristocratic behavior . However , an anxious group , which felt that the king was playing an increasingly unseemly role , too personal and bumptious , successfully aided the quiet rise in influence of Thomas Wolsey , cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second king . " Wolsey succeeded in restraining Henry and restoring some of Henry VIl 's more subtle methods of management , both for the sake of order in England and , to some degree , for Wolsey 's own purposes ; he was not a man wholly lacking in ambition . The cardinal soon showed increasing skill in managing his erratic sovereign while , at the same time , muting pretensions to an executive role of the Chief Council of which he himself was head . This ended the potential danger of factionalism becoming a menace from within the council and , using his position as the monarch 's principal favorite , he tolerated no new rivals within the Privy Chamber . By the time Henry reached his early thirties , the king who had been a strong , bluff , hearty young man , athlete of the Field of the Cloth of Gold , sadly discovered that he was entering middle age ( as was normal in those days ) . He became increasingly obese , more greedy for food and drink , and subject to the jovial influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as young as fifteen , who were known with a touch of a sneer as his " minions " or " pretty boys . " The voracious king continued to exceed in virtually all forms of pleasure and vice . For many years before his death , he was listed medically as suffering from a " sorre legge , " which could have been syphilis rather than gout . By the age of fifty-five , it was evident that his life , despite the exuberant vitality with which it had begun , was drawing to its close . Once a handsome , powerful sportsman , he had become a mass of disgustingly loathsome infirmities : his features bloated , and ( eventually , according to a study by the British Medical journal ) : " so unwieldy in body that he could not pass through an ordinary door and could be moved from one room to another only with the help of machinery and a number of attendants . His legs were swollen and ulcerated and festering sores caused an unbearable stench . Toward the end he could neither walk nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition should pass on physical malignancies to his children would not be surprising had they all been born of one mother and during one brief span . But this was in no sense the case . His first legitimate child , the daughter of Queen Catherine , was born in 1516 , when her father was twenty-five , and lived to rule after her younger brother 's death , earning the unfortunate sobriquet " Bloody Mary " because of her devout loyalty to her mother 's Roman Catholic ties and her persecution of the new Protestant Church of England created by Henry . And physicians today differ on whether a syphilitic father must necessarily infect all offspring after he himself sickens . Following Catherine 's official discard , Henry made Anne Boleyn ? the mistress whom he had flaunted openly before Catherine ? his queen . Henry had had what he wanted of Anne as a bedmate , but he wished a legal wife who could produce a male heir to the throne . Cardinal Wolsey urged him along this course , promising that Pope Clement VII would agree to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clement realized his papacy might fare better if it were linked to the Spanish protection of Emperor Charles V. He reneged on all ideas of seeing a Spanish queen offended in England . Henry thought the pope not worth conciliating ; he brusquely divorced Catherine and married Anne . She produced no male heir but the immortal Queen Elizabeth instead , and then was beheaded for adultery in 1536 . Wolsey was forced out of all his offices and died . The king thus broke with the Roman Church . All monasteries were dissolved , and an English Bible was authorized that moved English religious dogma nearer to the Reformation doctrine of the Ten Articles . Meanwhile , the king again married , this time to Jane Seymour , who presented Henry with the boy baby who became the short-lived Edward VI . Jane died after the effort . Henry then married Anne of Cleves , who had been sponsored by the dubious Thomas Cromwell , successor to Wolsey . Anne proved herself both personally distasteful and politically unnecessary to Henry , who divorced her and had Cromwell beheaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' faction , and beheaded her in 1542 . She was succeeded by Catherine Parr . Henry was an extraordinary and in many respects atrocious personality with his bevies of queens and mistresses , his addiction for the headsman 's axe , his regard for religion as a purely political tool , and his essentially despotic , egotistical character . Yet , especially in his youth when he was handsome , quick , and vigorous , he could prove a most attractive personality . I lis religious reformation was in fact desirable from the viewpoint of most  | Englishmen , and it was thus a fortunate coincidence that his sex life and passion for a male heir ( but feebly satisfied ) coincided with political and ecclesiastical conditions that favored a breach with Rome even though it was stimulated for private and dynastic reasons . His tyrannical supremacy over the Church saved England from the kind of civil war that had been touched off by religion in much of Europe . In a material sense , the immense care Henry took to build up England 's naval power was of signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of a British empire . He also helped cement the unity of England , Wales , Scotland , and Ireland and , strangely enough considering his autocratic temperament , to develop and extend the parliamentary system . Moreover , Erasmus , the great polymath , wrote to Sir Henry Guilford : " The English court contains at present more persons of real knowledge , and ability than any university in Europe . " The one thing none of the Tudors was really able to stamp out for England 's benefit was the continuing tendency toward " faction " first identified by Lady Margaret Beaufort . Her son , Henry VII , was the most successful of his line in opposing this trend , but that is possibly only because the weakness in the prevailing monarchical system was probably at its worst and most permanently rooted when he attained power . He recognized he could n't hold on long if the throne rocked too much . Yet vendettas began to arise again between high personages . They were notable under Henry VIII among the champions of different rivals for the continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boleyns and the Carews , the Somersets and the Northumberlands . There was even a spat between rival high Protestant factions under the ailing Edward VI , which lasted into the early part of Queen Elizabeth 's reign . Individual participants shifted : Walsingham versus Sussex ; Leicester versus Cecil . To a degree , depending upon the factionalists , the sovereigns , and the issues of the moment , it was as John Foxe , author of the Book of Martyrs , wrote of Henry VIII , who was at times far less dynamic than he himself imagined : " King Henry , according as his counsel was about him , so was he led . " And in this critical issue , he showed himself far less discerning and weaker than his father who , with his self-contained strength , had suppressed the worst features of factionalism and distanced himself from the individuals involved . Henry VII appears in the light of history as the most resolute of the Tudor sovereigns . Henry VIII was the gaudiest , vainest , brightest , and a strange mixture of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | insanity , cruelty and wisdom , political myopia and long-range planning . Edward VI was merely a meaningless ( although obstinate and even sometimes fanatical ) semicolon in history because of his increasingly feeble health . Since there was no other legitimate male heir , he was succeeded as sovereign by Queen Mary , who ruled for five years . Yet , although as a girl she was removed by Henry VIII from his court and treated as a bastard , she was later , with the aid of Parliament , re-established in rank after accepting bitterly humiliating conditions and succeeded Edward as sovereign when he died in 1553 . Despite her historical nickname of " Bloody Mary " because of her brutal treatment of unrepentant Protestant leaders , she was , in fact , from the start clement toward those who had taken up arms against her . But she was inexperienced in the art of government and basically innocent in international political affairs . She married King Philip of Spain , restored the Roman religion , and obtained papal absolution for England 's past disobedience to the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era of persecution and public executions started . She began to suffer from the delusion of false pregnancy at forty-two and was perhaps fortunate to have died before things got worse , as , during her five-year rule , the kingdom appeared headed into a chasm . Among historians , those who have sought to defend her point out that she was in no way cruel by nature and certainly kind to the poor of her realm . Her intentions were good , but the majority of her subjects were undoubtedly heretical toward her beliefs and stirred up enmity against her , an enmity that has managed to persist through time . The two outstanding Tudor rulers , as history will have it , do not include the calm , stern Henry VII , who established the dynasty , but that astonishing effigy of personal disintegration , Henry VIII , and his extraordinary daughter , Queen Elizabeth , who may well be the greatest sovereign modern Britain ever had but was certainly peculiar . For the latter quality , one can not fairly blame her . A sensitive , cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder , licentiousness , and horror and was never in a position to be sure of her own life or liberty until she herself came to the throne . By then she had been so toughened by experience ? since girlhood ? that she could lead her country successfully through dangerous battlefields to grandeur . Henry VIII 's children suffered the weirdest and most distorted upbringings imaginable . Catherine of Aragon ( who must have passed on at least some of her observations to her daughter , " Bloody Mary " ) had been compelled to watch her husband courting Anne Boleyn for six or seven years , a good  | of the time under the single roof that sheltered all of them . Before he got rid of Anne , Elizabeth 's mother , Henry had fallen in love with Jane Seymour and moved her into the palace . Then he decapitated Anne and married Jane next morning . When she died , he married Catherine Howard ; later , after cutting off her head , he had two more wives . How could any child remain normal with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives in all , murdered her mother . Then Lord Seymour paid feverish suit ? unsuccessfully ? to the young girl , who did n't know where her real home was or would be or even what faith to practice . For some four years after Seymour was beheaded for his impertinent ambitions , Elizabeth was clearly in bad psychological condition . She had at least two physical and mental breakdowns . All Henry VIII 's children ? and with clear reason ? had their moments of imbalance . The king 's bastard , the Duke of Richmond , died at seventeen after a long period of ill health . Mary , who suffered so much along with her mother , Catherine , was forced to commit perjury as a Catholic when she swore her father was supreme head of the Church and also that she was illegitimate . She consequently became a chronic invalid long before she was twenty : warped , embittered , infirm , and immutably headed for an early death . And I have already mentioned the syphilitic probabilities of King Edward VI 's morbid symptoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia , rotten teeth , a weak heart , and a flaccid constitution with a consequent series of illnesses . What is surprising , however , and here I find disagreement among medical men , is that Edward alone seems surely to have been tainted by venereal heritage while the other children perhaps simply broke down or failed during the approximate period of puberty . Moreover , the sores on Henry VIII 's legs are argued by some to refer simply to bad gout or varicose veins and by others to ordinary and syphilitic boils . There can be little doubt that the once-splendid constitution of young Henry had been wrecked by his middle-age troubles ; apart from the sick children produced by his wives and mistresses , several were simply stillborn . Bloody Mary , the eldest daughter , may have had various miscarriages and what was called ovarian dropsy . Both Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour had grave obstetrical difficulties . That Elizabeth , after such a hellish and abnormal childhood in such warped surroundings and with such precarious health , should have survived to become one of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a pawn in the game of Catholic and Protestant factions ( the sport , on whatever terrain , being the Tudor curse ) , and was preceded to the  | throne by a sick man and a religious fanatic . Yet she triumphed over incredible adversity with her astute bravery and intuitive feeling for survival . Indeed , it was the miserable girl Elizabeth who conceived of the very idea and phrase of " Great Britain , " which became the immense British Empire . It was Elizabeth who demonstrated a remarkable instinct for choosing the best among her courtiers , men like Burghley and Leicester ( the latter having often been dubbed her lover ) , Raleigh , Drake , etc . There is an enduring argument about her sex life . Being descended from the lusty Henry and the lascivious Anne Boleyn , Elizabeth may well have had yearnings , but that hardness of her childhood and the probable malformation of her genes may well have restrained her . Nor do physician-historians all agree on whether she escaped all consequences of her father 's venereal malady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high admiral under Edward VI and is believed to have proposed to Elizabeth a month after her father 's death . But she eluded his power grab , and he turned to Henry VIII 's widow , Catherine Parr , who married him ? and later found her husband in Elizabeth 's arms . The lord high admiral was declared guilty under a bill of attainder and , without trial , met that Tudor familiar , the headsman . Elizabeth had been opposed to marriage as a career since her childhood , and the Seymour experience heightened this prejudice . There is little doubt that she had great distaste for the marital institution after the fate of her mother and of Lady Jane Grey , Henry VII 's daughter , the consequences of her sister Mary 's marriage to King Philip II of Spain , and the extraordinary activity of the executioner throughout the sixteenth century for political , religious , and sexual reasons . Despite the strains , terrors , and uncertainties surrounding her , she displayed genius and a certain egotistical , bold literary ability presented in lovely penmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the education her father had ordered for her by doing quite a few useful translations into Latin , Italian , and French of prayers that had been composed in English by Catherine Parr . Moreover , she kept up this intellectual activity . When she was sixty-four , an ill-advised Polish ambassador addressed a slighting discourse to her , and she astounded him with an angry torrent of Latin in reply . She was not only familiar with the classics but exceedingly fluent in French and Italian . Later she confided to a crone of her acquaintance that as a girl she knew six foreign languages better than her own . Her favorite subject for study was history , although she found time to continue with architecture , astronomy , mathematics , music , and logic . Her  | education had been supervised during girlhood by John Cheke and Roger Ascham , the latter being then England 's outstanding scholar . During the first decade of her reign , foreign policy was her leading state preoccupation . One by one she managed to find her untutored way successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential in terms of diplomatic affairs ) , separate interventions in Scotland and France , a bitter trade dispute with Holland , and a crisis over the seizure of Brill by the Sea Beggars in 1572 , followed by France 's Saint Bartholomew 's Day Massacre , an affront to all Protestants . The ultimate goal sought by Elizabeth and her advisers was to avoid a heightening of tension with Spain . It was clear , judging by hindsight , that an Anglo-Spanish collision was inevitable from 1576 on , but Philip II instructed his statesmen and military leaders to pacify the Netherlands first . England sent mercenary troops to aid the Sea Beggars on the Dutch coast ( under Spanish suzerainty ) , and the French and Dutch churches in London raised funds among their congregations to arm and finance a company of volunteers to fight against the Spanish in Flushing . But despite delays in the sailing of the great naval armada being constructed by Philip 's ship-builders for an invasion ? delays caused by Admiral Drake 's raid on Spanish ports and by Philip 's own parsimonious efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Fleet sailed in 1588 . It was thwarted by Aeolus , the god of winds , rather more than by Drake 's bold and hardy seamanship . It is a matter of great fortune for England that Elizabeth 's worst illness was between 1548 and 1552 , so that she had sufficiently recovered in time to face the terrible crises that racked her realm but eventually led it to its full Renaissance glory . During her bad period , she suffered from melancholia , weeping , headaches , shortness of breath , and difficulty in concentrating . She never became a strong , durable girl ; nevertheless , her willpower and imagination were indomitable , and she regained considerable physical vigor . One commentator wrote that in " 1572 the Queene also herselfe , which hitherto had enjoyed very perfect health , ( for shee never eate meate but when her appetite served her , nor dranke Wine without alaying ) fell sick of the small pox at Hampton Court . But shee recovered again before it was heard abroad that she was sicke . " The same writer added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sound health , by reason of her abstinence from wine , and most temperate diet unlike her father which she often said was the noblest part of physicke , being now in her Climatericall yeere , to wit , the seventyeth yeere of her age , began to be assayled with some weaknesse both of health and old age . "  | Some medical experts who have studied available records of the physical and mental conditions of the legitimate and illegitimate offspring of Henry VIII are of the opinion that Elizabeth 's increasingly pronounced anemia , decaying teeth , and numerous other worsening symptoms of decline may very well be the direct sequels of the lack of a strong constitution , which in turn was the result of a diseased father . It was only by extraordinary intelligence and a formidable will that Elizabeth had managed as well as she did before the inevitable set in . It is known that in late 1562 , aged twenty-nine , four years after she ascended the throne , Queen Elizabeth had smallpox . She later suffered amenorrhea ( absence of menstruation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion of inherited syphilis . It is conceivable that skin diseases from which she suffered resulted from bad diet , but it is also possible they were actually symptoms of congenital venereal taint . But then , some physicians have argued in recent years that there is not even absolute proof that Henry himself suffered from that dreaded disease . The debate is wholly inconclusive . Another disability came over Elizabeth as she grew older : her exquisite talent for calligraphy degenerated into a scrawl . But this could indeed have resulted from bad vision , faulty glasses , or general debility . One simple conclusion by medical historians is that Elizabeth was not robust enough to shake off minor ailments and consequently was needlessly prone to more serious diseases . She was never in blooming good health at any time before 1588 ? year of the famous Armada ? and then , eight years later , she failed badly . But at no point in her life , high or low , is there the faintest hint of anything that precluded active use of her brain and , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts concerning her normal feminine sexual capacities and enjoyment , she was sufficiently athletic to take part in hunts and to dance sedately even at an advanced age . At the time of Wyatt 's unsuccessful rebellion against Catholic Queen Mary , many of Elizabeth 's enemies ? both political and religious ? urged Mary to have her half-sister done away with , and the Habsburg Emperor Charles V sent Mary a special envoy to argue for such a solution . But Elizabeth used her poor health skillfully as a political weapon and persuaded Mary 's physicians she had n't the strength to leave Ashbridge , where she was quartered . She thus delayed her final incarceration in that ghastly fortress , the Tower of London , festooned with the heads and bodies of convicted traitors . And once again Elizabeth , by her combination of wits , luck , and  | astounding reserves of energy , escaped the headman 's axe and the Tower itself , although when she was eventually taken there , she remarked mournfully , " This night I think to die . " In 1554 Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Protestant Elizabeth , hoping thus to thwart the French plot to place Mary Stuart on the English throne should the present incumbent die . When Philip 's suit succeeded , most Englishmen feared the birth of a Catholic heir , and the Spanish Inquisition was installed in Britain , beginning its intolerance and executions . It was after this event that " Bloody " Mary earned her dreadful nickname . But Mary soon demonstrated her latter-day Tudor difficulties in producing a baby . I have taken pains in this essay to stress the physical and sexual aspects of that remarkable father and daughter , Henry VIII and Elizabeth I , who dominated the short Tudor dynasty . Because these physical and sexual aspects were so vitally important to the inner cores of their strong characters , they had a very special influence on the course of European and world history . In a well-known scientific " opinion , " one expert concluded of Elizabeth : " In a medical sense her sexual system was blasted . She had neither the instinct of sweetheart or mother ? for these instincts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her selfishness ? for her crown and her kingdom as much as for herself ? must be sought in her really sexless condition . Elizabeth toyed with young men but one can not conceive more than that . " This is a rather strong opinion in view of the fact that Elizabeth is so often described as an attractive woman ( hard to believe , if one looks at most paintings and miniatures of her ) and that her name was sexually linked by gossip with Seymour , Dudley , Raleigh , Oxford , Blount , Essex , and Anjou , among others and in varying degrees and ways . The Earl of Leicester , a tall , handsome scholar-athlete , was probably the closest friend Elizabeth ever had and , except for Burghley , remained in her intimate counsels the longest period . But there is no doubt Elizabeth was the last true royal autocrat in western Europe . She insisted upon complete and absolute domination until the end of her days because she genuinely believed this was the best thing for her country , and her love for England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was the total boss . She told her Parliament : " I will have here but one Mistress and no Master . " She sent word through her Lord Keeper , Bacon , that parliament should not " meddle with any matters of state . " This made France 's Louis XIV seem almost liberal . Once when the speaker of the House Appeared with the customary  | request that its members be free from arrest , have access to her royal person , and liberty of speech , she replied that liberty of speech existed in the House : " but they must know what liberty they were entitled to ; not a liberty for every one to speak what he listeth or what cometh in his brain to utter : their privilege extended no farther than a liberty of Aye or No . " It was Elizabeth , by the way , who , in 1596 , introduced a formal racial policy in England with a decree requesting the removal of " Diverse blackamores brought into this realm , of which kind of people there are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of a surge of unemployment at the time , was not unusual in Europe of those days when racial prejudice was first starting to stir . In fact , even prior to the white Anglo-Saxon immigration , there had been blacks in England among the soldiers serving in Caesar 's legions and occupying army . Nevertheless , I believe the first document embodying British racism was Elizabeth 's . None of her greatest aides , such as Essex and Burghley , did anything except what they were told to do . They were really the queen 's glorified clerks or secretaries . As the historian Frederick Chamberlin concluded : " The western world has never seen such another absolute monarchy ; and no view that Elizabeth was not the real power , driving force , and brain of her government ever obtained among her contemporaries . Every monarch in Europe so considered her . The Pope said that he and she were the only rulers capable of their tasks . " The two greatest members of the Tudor dynasty , Henry VIII and his youngest legitimate child , Elizabeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting sovereigns of England , even though it may be contended with more than a little validity that Alfred the Great , a largely legendary individual , was the most important . Henry truly introduced to his country the violent , colorful , intellectual excitement of the Renaissance , furnished it with the naval weapon that ultimately gave it an empire " on which the sun never sets , " and for wholly godless reasons sponsored a new religion that matured and endured . All these new developments flourished under Elizabeth I. Hers was the intellectual and cultural Renaissance of Francis Bacon , Marlowe , and Shakespeare ; the era of the great explorers and pirates like Drake and Cavendish , the circumnavigators who made England rich and strong . They stimulated the tough , imaginative , individualistic population to make of their country , hitherto a second-rate European power compared with France and  | Spain , a mighty , aggressive , greedy , imperial agglomerate , exceedingly difficult to invade , and a dominant world factor until the mid-twentieth century . There is no doubt that Elizabeth herself was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feared . Two popes , Pius V and Gregory XIII , excommunicated her . Almost each contemporary tenant of the Vatican throne sought to encourage murder plots against her . Sixtus V , who helped to finance the Spanish Armada 's unsuccessful invasion in 1588 , said of Elizabeth : " What a woman . What a princess . Ruler of half of one small island , she snaps her fingers at the two greatest kings in Christendom Spain and France . " One institution developed under ( and probably by ) the " Virgin Queen " was the magnificent British intelligence service , which is still an important factor in international calculations . There are art students and intelligencers who believe that a symbol of this highly secret but widespread and vital factor in Elizabethan power is allegorically represented in the famous " Rainbow " portrait of Queen Elizabeth painted around 1600 , probably commissioned by Francis Bacon and Robert Cecil with the sovereign 's own knowledge . The artist is not known , but it is believed to be an Anglo-Flemish painter , perhaps Marcus Gheeraerts II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of the Cecil family , marquesses of Salisbury . Experts on various aspects of the Renaissance point out that Elizabeth was the most intellectual monarch of her time and was fascinated by the then fashionable language of symbols and ciphers . This encourages the belief ( described by Dr. Stevan Dedijer of Sweden 's Lund University ) that the portrait was ? as conceived by those who commissioned it ? a deliberately mysterious statement of the policy that made Britain " Great " for so long : scientific , commercial , naval , intellectual , espionage , etc. ? all as depicted in the contemporary language of symbolism . By studying the elaborate patterns of human eyes and mouths woven into the silk of the dress Elizabeth is wearing , one comprehends the attention she personally devoted to intelligence ? so much so that the papal nuncio in Flanders reported to Rome : " The Queen of England , I know not how , penetrated everything . " Mary Queen of Scots wrote the pope that Elizabeth had agents close to him ? and Francis Walsingham , her chief intelligencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . It was Walsingham who stressed that open eyes and ears ( as depicted in the " Rainbow " picture ) were vital to intelligence . One motto of the queen was " Video , Taceo " ( I see , but say nothing ) . In 1582 Britain first recorded an annual secret service budget ( 750  | pounds a year ) . All the most important Elizabethan court figures were given instructions on what to observe before they took off for Europe on the customary Grand Tour . At a festival in 1595 , Francis Bacon cautioned the queen and her chief ministers : " Have care that your intelligence , which is the light of your state , do not go out or burn dim or obscure . " An effort to understand the curious symbolism and intentions of this provocative portrait , which deliberately flatters its subject by depicting her as a lovely , youngish woman when she was already a hag of almost seventy , shows that it is a preconceived boast and not a simple work of art . Therefore it is more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly have understood , in demonstrating to scholars the deliberate plan and methodology conceived by Elizabeth and her principal advisers to produce a huge global empire . In a weird way , Henry VIII , the father , brutally and energetically pushed England 's intellectual , political , and naval Renaissance into flower ( the way Philip of Macedon had built the foundations for a land empire in Greece ) . Elizabeth I utilized and directed these initial efforts to full advantage , producing a situation from which an overseas empire burgeoned that was at least comparable to the far briefer imperial domain of Philip 's son , Alexander .  | A Testament of Beauty : Jacopo , Gentile , and Giovanni Bellini Perhaps the greatest family cluster of painters known to history was produced by the Renaissance family of Bellini in the Most Serene Republic of Venice , one of the richest , greatest maritime powers of all time . It is customary to assume that great painters and great poets , like Athena , should spring suddenly from Zeus 's head ? as in legend ? rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views and theories of modern genetics . There is no more reason to suppose that the harmonious and complimentary ideas of Shakespeare 's or Pushkin 's mother and father were responsible for the superb genius of their sons than to speculate along similar lines in the cases of Duccio , Velasquez , or Leonardo da Vinci . The timing of the artist 's birth and the circumstances of the milieu surrounding him , added to the taste and desires of his generation , the wealth and culture of his surroundings , and the teachings handed on to him are easily of far more importance than the accidental encounter of certain genes . The arrival in the world of painting from the Zeus 's brow of the Venetian republic could be said to coincide with the birth of Jacopo Bellini , believed , without certainty , to have been in 1396 . He lived through almost three quarters of the great fifteenth century . He was the first early Renaissance painter of Venice , and , together with two of his sons , Gentile and Giovanni , fathered a school of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice was a secular power long before Jacopo 's birth . It maintained a fluctuating dominance in the eastern Mediterranean and the Adriatic against formidable combinations of Italian rivals such as Genoa ; Barbary pirates ; the Byzantine emperors and then their successor 's , the Ottoman Turkish sultans ;  | and even those feudal Norman and Frankish lords who set up temporary but fierce independent fiefdoms , primarily in Greece , after the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 and , above all , following that great city 's fall to the Turks in 1453 . The balance of power in the vital strategic and commercial area connecting the Black and Marmora Seas with the eastern Aegean , the Nile delta , Crete , the Dodecanese islands , the Peloponnesus , and the Adriatic was of enormous importance to the economic and cultural exchanges of East and West . Indeed , the Old Port of the tiny island of Spetsais , off the Gulf of Argos , where I lived in Greece for many years , served as the central point of a fierce fight between the Venetian fleet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monemvasia to the Bosphorus and Black Sea for gold ( like the ancient Argonauts ) , wool , wheat , timber , furs . Venice 's success in destroying most of this armada en route to the northeast in the thirteenth-century battle of Sette Pozzi was one of several key encounters of the Middle Ages that helped Venice reaffirm its hardiness and renown . It was this and many other little-known confrontations that enabled the tough , greedy Venetians to become a European power for more than three centuries . How extraordinary that so small a city , situated on an Adriatic isle and with a population of only 160,000 in the sixteenth century , should have shown itself so adept at empire-building . But its inhabitants were intelligent , strong , with the toughness and frequent red hair brought southward by invading Teutonic and Slavonic tribes who overran the earlier Wendish settlers . The Venetians , elated by the respect and homage shown them by other nations , some of which should have been greater and some of which were , developed an original system of government with doges elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially trading and manufacturing community with a high standard of living , and producing a civil service and , above all , a professional diplomatic service that was the envy of contemporaries . The steadily growing wealth of Venice , not seriously damaged by the cupidity of the Slavic Dalmatians across the Adriatic , financed a famous fleet acknowledged by the Golden Bull of the Byzantine Emperor Basil , which traded privileges to Venetian merchants in exchange for emergency availability of the republic 's navy if the Greek ruler needed help when Genoa was disinclined . Despite the jealousy of their constant rivals , the Genoese , the Venetians are said to have numbered about 200,000 in the city on the Golden Horn ? or more than there were in Venice itself . They were reputed to have held a large quarter of the Byzantine capital in terror with their lusty brawls.  | The Italians were scarcely true to the spirit of their accord with the emperor on the Bosphorus . When the Fourth Crusade was proclaimed at Soissons , France , and its leaders applied to the Venetians for troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needed ships until the crusaders first conquered Zara and Dalmatia for the republic . Then , after this blackmail , the fleet sailed . Constantinople was sacked , and Venice , for its double-dealing role , was awarded " a half and a quarter of the Roman empire , " which is what the Byzantines called their domain . They were the eastern offspring of Rome 's twin heirs . It was Venice , as a first-class European power , which dealt out the fiefdoms to Frankish mercenary chiefs more interested in personal gain in Balkan regions than in moving on to the Holy Land . The Venetians knew the value of a quick ducat . They scandalized Christendom by entering into a treaty with the Ottoman Turks and , in seesaw wars with Genoa , the remnants of Byzance , and even the Turks , held onto the eastern Mediterranean and control of the Levant trade . The decline of the republic began at the end of the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth , which is the acme of the Bellini period in painting . Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures as the famous four horses of St. Mark 's Cathedral , brought westward from Constantinople , and the mosaic techniques with which the Turks had lavished the adornment of their magnificent mosques and palaces . The taste for artistic beauty had been deeply instilled . Local craftsmen learned even more from the stolen treasures , acquiring talents which they embellished with their own genius . It is curious to compare the cultural mirrors of the Dutch republic and the Venetian republic , both small but mighty states which had great influence at the height of their political and military fame . When one visits the Mauritshuis in the Hague , perhaps the finest small museum in the world , one sees on its walls the greatest painting ever produced in the Netherlands ? and it mirrors with incredible precision the finest century in Dutch history . From around i600 to around 1700 the array of genius is fascinating ; Vermeer and Rembrandt coincide with a moment when Dutch arms were successfully combatting the great Spanish army and defeating British ships . There is no equivalent museum in Venice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellini clan ? those who ignited the gradual Venetian genius in painting ? one finds that its sunburst rises with empire . And one sees no hint of a strategic decline ( like I Tolland 's ) , only a rising sunburst on the global scene .  | The Minerva from whose body ( a figurative forehead ) Jacopo Bellini emerged at the end of the fourteenth century was Franceschina , the wife of a tinsmith named Niccolo . Since painting was still behind the times in Venice , as compared with Tuscany and other flourishing Italian centers of the immediate pre-Renaissance period , Jacopo 's artistic inclinations evolved early . He studied in his home city under the accomplished Umbrian master Gentile da Fabriano , who had come to Venice in search of work and pupils , of whom he found several . When Fabriano went to Florence , Jacopo followed him and learned still more about classic style and natural grace from Donatello , Ghiberti , Masaccio , and Uccello than his original Umbrian master could ever teach him . By 1429 Jacopo had returned to Venice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented family by marrying a girl from Pesaro named Anna . She bore him at least one son , Gentile ; there is argument about whether Jacopo 's second son , Giovanni , was the child of Anna or another woman . A daughter named Nicolosia was also produced . The atmosphere in which this creative clan lived in the earlier half of the fifteenth century was vigorous . Looking backward , it hinted strongly of the coming full glory of the Renaissance splendor that followed Constantinople 's fall in 1453 , when so many scholars and artists fled to western cities from the Turks , spreading their emigre knowledge and talent . On its own , Venice , through its widespread trade , its fabricating knowledge , and its newly developing painters like Jacopo Bellini , Gentile da Fabriano , and nearby Verona 's Pisanello , was embellishing the republic 's reputation as a cultural center . A large companile or bell tower towered above St. Mark 's Cathedral in the city 's main square . Quaintly-prowed gondolas glided through the canals past stone filigree palaces . And every Ascension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzino d'oro , or " golden bark " ) to perform the ceremony of " wedding the sea , " which sumptuously commemorated the republic 's maritime dominion and specifically recalled Doge Orseolo II 's conquest of Dalmatia . Such splendor could not but dazzle the impressionable minds of young painters . In 1436 Jacopo journeyed to Verona and then southward to Ferrara , where he established connections with the ruling family of Este and the . Malatestas of nearby Rimini . In that city the artistic household dominated by Jacopo was extended when his daughter , Nicolosia , married the famous painter Andrea Mantegna of Padua , later a great master of Mantua . Had the theory of transmission of artistic genes prevailed , there could have been little better possibility for its proof than the children of a Mantegna and a Bellini ;  | but alas , there is no such indication . I believe firmly in my Athena theory of creative genetics . It would seem that Jacopo died around 1470 . ( There is no reliable record , but , in documents now available , Anna began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time of his death , Jacopo , together with Fabriano and Pisanello , had brought the artistic potential of Venice to full maturity . An abundance of his paintings and drawings still exists in museums and album collections of Western Europe . Jacopo 's new achievements in depicting perspective were highly original , and a now-lost book on perspective was dedicated to him by a Paduan scientist . Jacopo was the first of the Bellinis to establish a contemporary and enduring reputation , and he attracted a small group of followers and helpers , although nothing like those who later flocked to his sons , Gentile and Giovanni , who themselves began their careers as their father 's pupils and assistants . From 1466 on , Gentile ( 1429 ? 1507 ) became renowned for his independent ability rather than as a talented member of a family " school " or " collective . " He began to receive important personal commissions , such as his portrait of Cardinal Bessarione , and was also knighted by the German Emperor Frederick III during the latter 's visit to Venice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famous portraitist , and was made official painter for the Most Serene Republic . When Sultan Mohammed II asked Venice to provide him with an outstanding painter , Gentile was sent to Constantinople , where he remained two years , leaving his brother Giovanni to attend to commitments he had already made in Venice . Gentile was dispatched in the galleys of the Most Serene Republic , whose commissioner in Constantinople presented him to Mohammed . Giorgio Vasari reports that : He was treated with much favor as something new , above all after he had given that Prince a most lovely picture , which he greatly admired , being well nigh unable to believe that a mortal man had within himself so much divinity , so to speak , as to be able to represent the objects of nature so vividly . Gentile had been there no long time when he portrayed the Emperor Mohammed from life so well that it was held a miracle . That Emperor , after having seen many specimens of his art , asked Gentile whether he had the courage to paint his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " did not allow many days to pass before he had made his own portrait with a mirror , with such resemblance that it appeared alive . p 99 The Sultan 's portrait is now unfortunately ruined . But many specimens of Gentile 's Turkish voyage remain , including a small watercolor of a scribe and drawings of other types on the Ottoman scene . When Gentile returned home to a warm welcome from his brother , Giovanni , he was awarded a provision of 200 crowns a year for the rest of his life . He then took up his earlier pledged commitments . These included canvases commissioned by the signoria of the republic from several artists : both Gentile and Giovanni Bellini ; Alvise Vivarini ; Carpaccio ; and eventually Titian , Veronese , and Tintoretto . The idea was to glorify Venice , but much of the work was later ruined by salt spray sheeted in by the famous Adriatic bora storms . All the Bellinis seem to have worked feverishly so long as they were alive and well . Gentile , who lived until 1507 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of his death , so his brother , Giovanni , took up the brush and finished the project . Happily , it has been preserved in the Brera Museum of Milan . As the eldest child , Gentile virtually grew up in his father 's shop . Well attuned to the fairy-talelike narrative sensitivity of the late Gothic period , he was attracted by what he heard of his brother-in-law , Mantegna . Nicolosia 's husband was then painting in nearby Padua , whence the fame of his novelties and new approaches had begun to spread . It was surely as a result of this period that Gentile learned to design the doors of the organ in Venice 's St. Mark 's Cathedral , the case for the Byzantine crucifix of Cardinal Bessarione , and the " Annunciation " now in the Lugano collection of the Thyssen family . He developed a dramatic but heavy and unsubtle technique that was later rendered more delicate by painters of the High Renaissance . But his portraiture was superb . He was much sought after : Mohammed II , Queen Catherine Cornaro of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Gallery and Venice 's Correr Museum . Giovanni Bellini , who was four years younger than Gentile and lived until 1516 , also started with his father , but at the age of twenty-four he opened his own studio in San Lio . He continued to collaborate often with his father and brother , as exemplified in the chapel in the Church of St. Anthony in Padua , where all three joined in designing and decorating the chapel for the heroic mercenary leader Gattamelata . This was completed and signed by the two brothers in 1460 , but subsequently lost . After Gentile 's Turkish sojourn , a place had been kept open for him by the republic to resume working beside his brother on a great series of historical pictures illustrating the role of Venice in the wars between the  | Papal States and the Emperor Barbarossa . These were on canvas and in oil , to avoid the destruction to frescoes caused by the city 's stormy climate . Unfortunately , they were destroyed by fire in 1577 . The series depicted the pope standing in St. Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then preparing for war ; the pontiff urging the doge and signoria to equip thirty galleys for battle against the Germans , and then blessing the doge and Venetian senators . Gentile followed the example of his father , Jacopo , in proving that his best talent was in individual portraiture . The severity of the manner he had learned during his time in Padua contrasted strikingly with the increasing luxuriousness of the blossoming Renaissance . Giovanni ( 1430 ? 1516 ) is probably the most renowned of the Bellinis . He also , from an early age , came under the influence of the dry Paduan school of his brother-in-law , Mantegna . This manner seems , on close scrutiny , to have remained a dominant factor until Mantegna transferred to Mantua and the court of the Gonzagas , acclaimed as the most cultured court in Italy . From then on Giovanni produced a considerable series of religious paintings which display an original combination of Paduan severity in drawing , a complex rigidity of drapery , and a particular human pathos specifically attributed to Giovanni himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservator of art in the great ducal palace , but neither his own nor his restored works in that lovely building survived the terrible fire of 1577 . Practically all of his original works are in tempera . In those days Venetian painters made panels rarely , and when they excepted their rule , they only used fir wood brought down by ship from the Teutonic and Scandinavian lands , primarily along the river Adige . Frescoes were risky because of the salty damp from the sirocco and bora winds , and canvas , a strong , easily handled material whose surface could readily accept oil paints , eventually became popular among the artists . It was Giovanni who shifted increasingly from working with tempera to oils , a new medium first introduced to Venice by Antonello da Messina . This brought a more worldly charm and softness to some of his work and encouraged him to introduce groups of singing and viol-playing angels to attend upon his saints . The last dozen years of his life saw him become so popular an artist that he was overwhelmed with commissions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest German painter of the Renaissance , visited Venice for a second time , he described Giovanni as " still the best in painting " and marked by courtesy and generosity to foreign visitors . p 101 Both artistically and in a worldly sense Giovanni 's career has been called : " upon the whole the most serenely and unbrokenly prosperous , from youth to extreme old age , which fell to any artist of the early Renaissance . " His influence was indeed greatly magnified by many remarkable pupils , of whom the most famous were Giorgione and Titian . He has been dubbed " the greatest painter of his age and the father of the age of Titian . " His own independent view of art and the painter 's role was made plain when the Duchess of Ferrara asked him for a detailed symbolic painting whose concept she outlined . He replied that he was used to suiting himself and to giving pleasure without restrictions . Vasari , a sixteenth-century painter and architect of indifferent talent but a famous art historian and critic , was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never did critic wield a milder pen if he chanced to be writing of Florentine art , or a more prejudiced one if he dealt with things of Venice . " Yet he , who wrote more than four hundred years ago , has become a prime sourcebook and influence of current opinions . George Hay 's book on Bellini both cites and balances Vasari , writing : " Giovanni , or Gian Bellini as he is generally called except in Venetian argot , is one of the most fascinating painters of the fifteenth century . He has left many a lovely picture to the world , but alas he was no diarist , he had no Boswell , and there are gaps in the history of his life that will never be filled up . Hay points out that Vasari dealt but briefly with Jacopo Bellini , founder of the dynasty and , according to Vasari , " It is said that the new paganism held more attractions for him than the old faith , and that the majority of his commissions were from the great and flourishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacopo Bellini , Giovanni 's father , painted on canvas , not wood , and in the comparatively rare latter case , it was on fir floated down from Austria and Germany . Vasari apparently felt that Jacopo 's hints of paganism left Giovanni virtually untouched , and it is known the younger son rejected many commissions offered by wealthy patrons with no desire for sacred subjects and did not fulfill others . Hay noted that when Giovanni was born , in 1430 , Venice was " on the road to her ultimate decline . . . and , although Venice had annexed nearly a dozen provinces in half a century , the outlay had been out of proportion to the results . At the same time , the Venetians did not know that their splendid state was on the downward road . " Gian Bellini was a hard worker and serene spirit despite the historically  | critical moment when he lived ; he died sixty-three years after Constantinople 's fall ? the acme of the Renaissance . His pupil Titian found it easy to depict pagan goddesses and the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no concessions to the neopagan age , save a single bacchanalia painted for the Duke of Ferrara . It is an interesting aspect that the family association of the two generations of painters could so benefit the swift artistic changes and techniques that were occurring in the early and mid-Renaissance . Jacopo , having traveled extensively in Italy 's cultural centers , knew Florence at the time of Brunelleschi , Padua where Giotto 's tradition was then still very strong , and brought back to Venice new ideas together with the hint of the revolutionary pagan sentiment introduced . Gian Bellini developed these new ideas to such a degree that they made possible the beauty of his outstanding pupils , Titian and Giorgione . The new learning proceeded hand in hand with the emphasis on personal loveliness which had all too often been relegated to the background by the Church in earlier periods . This can be seen in Giovanni 's pictures , which bring sensuous beauty and emotion to canvas in a degree perhaps previously unknown . The Venice of Gian Bellini 's most active period must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Charles VIII , Philippe de Commynes , arrived in 1494 and recalled a memoir : I was taken along the High Street . They call it the Grand Canal and it is very broad . Galleys cross it and it is the fairest street , I believe , that may be in the whole world , and fitted with the best houses . The ancient onces are painted , and most have a great piece of porphyry and serpentine in front . It is the most triumphant city I have ever seen and doth most honor to ambassadors and strangers . It doth most wisely govern itself , and the service of God is most solemnly performed . George Hay accepts this French diplomat 's emphasis on beauty and triumph , and for him it helps to explain why " Gian Bellini became a lover of the world in its most picturesque aspect , accepting without hesitation the traditional explanation of its creation . . . . " Hay continues : His appeal to the layman is direct and spontaneous . A countryman who has never seen a studio can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children , can feel the charm of the sunshine that fills the air and lights sea and land , can  | recognize the infinite glamor of the roads that wind away into the mysterious distance of the background , can enjoy the rich , almost sensuous , coloring . Although few personal tales of Gian Bellini 's life exist , there is one interesting report that as a young swain he dressed up like a nobleman of Venice seeking a portrait and visited the studio of the popular Antonello da Messina , who understood the commission . Bellini is said to have studied the entire procedure closely and to have learned many technical details . Giovanni 's continued fidelity to the Church despite pagan influences that had been introduced to him through his father is shown in his almost obsessive fascination with altar painting . John Ruskin called his altarpiece in the Church of St. Zaccaria one of the " two finest pictures in the world . " This is no mean tribute even though Ruskin 's opinions are now regarded as frequently flawed . Unfortunately , none of his large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . These included a representation of Pope Alexander III receiving Frederick Barbarossa after the end of the Schism of 1177 , and three others of the same pontiff on ceremonial occasions . They were frescoes and guaranteed by Giovanni to outlast the sirocco and bora winds for at least two centuries , but in less than half that time they were destroyed by fire . Although Gentile had been selected by the republic to visit Constantinople when Mohammed II asked for a Venetian artist , Giovanni had been named official painter to the state and did a portrait of Doge Loredano when he succeeded to that esteemed office in 1501 . This is especially noteworthy because it is known that Titian was already working in Gian Bellini 's studio at the time . Also in 1501 , Isabella , Marchioness of Mantua , sent a representative to Venice to ask Giovanni to paint a secular subject . He was by then an old man , as things were then generally measured , and simply accepted an advance payment and turned to other work . Only three years later , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she proposed to take legal action ) , was the painting accomplished . She asked for a second secular picture , and after much tergiversation he refused . Isabella d'Este , of whom a poet wrote : " At the sound of her name all the Muses rise and do reverence , " was a highly intelligent and also persistent , obstinate woman . She had seen and admired Gian Bellini 's work in Venice before asking a friend named Vianello to obtain for her a pledge from Gian to do a picture .  | The old artist brusquely told Vianello he was busy working for the signory in the Doge 's Palace and was taken up every day from early morning until nightfall . Vianello seems to have been an experienced bazaar trader . When the painter said that nevertheless he might consider altering his schedule should he be paid 150 ducats for a painting , Isabella 's agent haggled him down to ioo ducats , of which an advance of 25 ducats was accepted by Bellini as a pledge . Only after that , according to the extraordinarily rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's papers , did Bellini ask precisely what she wished . Isabella replied with words that would not today be considered to have much precision : she wanted anything antique and , in effect , moralistic in its purport . But the painter kept dodging specifics , went to his estate inland , and showed he could not be located . The marchioness finally lost her temper and told Vianello : " We can no longer endure the villainy of Giovanni Bellini . " She instructed her agent to apply to the doge for Gian Bellini 's imprisonment for fraud . It appears that this stimulated the painter to react . Despite the fact that he held the respect of the doge , Leonardo Loredano , whose portrait he had made , Giovanni was clearly alarmed and hastened to show Vianello a " Nativity , " three-fourths finished . He also sent Isabella an almost ignominious letter of excuses . She graciously replied : " Your Nativity ' is as dear to us as any picture we possess . " It was shortly after this incident that Darer came again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venetians were agreeable companions and " some " of them could paint . But he praised Gian Bellini highly and even offered to purchase one of his pictures . From that point on , the available records have little to report on Giovanni until 1513 . Then , well over eighty years old , his status as official painter to the signory was challenged by his own magnificent pupil , Titian . The latter informed the Council of Ten that he was more interested in fame than profit ( as he had demonstrated by refusing to serve the pope ) and desired the first available vacancy in the German Foundation then existing on the same terms as Zuan Bellini ( the Venetian way of spelling Gian Bellini ) . Bellini , his pupils and his friends were irked , despite the acknowledged and increasing reputation of Titian . ( The same thing happened years later when Tintoretto tried to take over an official position from the older Titian . ) Titian was eventually told by the council that the job could not be his until Bellini 's commission had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project and what had already been accomplished by old  | Giovanni and decided that not enough had been produced for its investment . It was decided there had been too much laxity in supervising expenditures of the Most Serene Republic during the years since the treaty between France , Austria , Spain , and the Papal States had been concluded at Cambrai . Although Venice had been induced to seek aid from the sultans of Turkey and Egypt , earlier losses had been followed by the vanishing of Venetian influence in Lombardy , Verona , Vicenza , and Padua . The republic had not yet regained its force and vigor . In this atmosphere Gian Bellini died in his ninetieth year , November 29 , 1516 . Some years later Vasari commented : " There were not wanting in Venice those who by sonnets and epigrams sought to do him honor after his death as he had done honor to himself and his country during his life . " The last grand Italian master of purely religious subjects had expired . The way had become clear for the advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensue . Moreover , admiration for Gian Bellini 's work shrank continually because of the number of pictures from his studio bearing forged signatures . It was only after the rise in the nineteenth century of studious critics like Crowe , Morelli , and Bernard Berenson that a revival ensued . Giorgio Vasari , whose anti-Venetian bias has already been mentioned , relegated Giovanni Bellini to the group of acknowledged " masters " whom he criticized for having " sought with great efforts to do the impossible in art by means of labor , particularly in foreshortening and in things unpleasant to the eye which were as painful to see as they were difficult for them to execute . " However , since that early and pro-Florentine critic included in the same group Piero della Francesca , Ghirlandajo , Botticelli , Mantegna , and Luca Signorelli , it is easy to mitigate or even ignore such negative views . When Gian Bellini 's death was described by the sixteenth-century critic-historian ( who lived only less than three generations later than his subject ) , Vasari wrote : " Finally , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome by old age , leaving an eternal memorial of his name in the works that he had made both in his native city of Venice and abroad , and he was honorably buried in the same church and in the same tomb in which he had laid his brother Gentile to rest . " Whatever may be said of Vasari 's prejudice in favor of Florence ( where he , a native of Arezzo , studied and worked ) and against Venice , he surely had a soft spot for Gian Bellini . The most reasonable intellectual explanation I have read of the flowering of Venetian Renaissance painting in general and the Bellinis in particular is that of Bernard Berenson , the great American connoisseur , expert , and critic  |p1o6  who amassed the collection of Mrs. Henry Gardner in Boston and who spent the last decades of his long life in his lovely villa , I Tatti , outside Florence . He wrote : The Church from the first took account of the influences of color as well as music upon the emotions . From the earliest times it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its legends . . . . At about the time when Gian Bellini and his contemporaries were attaining maturity , the Renaissance had ceased to be a movement carried on by scholars and poets alone . It had become sufficiently widespread to seek popular as well as literary utterance and thus , toward the end of the fifteenth century it naturally turned to painting ... . We find the Venetian painters . . . more and more intent upon giving the space they paint its real depth . . . . As early as the beginning of the sixteenth century a few of the greater Venetian painters had succeeded also in giving some appearance of reality to atmosphere . The painters of the end of the fifteenth century who met with the greatest success in solving these problems were Giovanni and Gentile Bellini , Cima da Conegliano and Carpaccio , and we find each of them enjoyable ... . It is significant that Venice was the first state which made a business of preserving the portraits of its chief rulers . Those which Gentile and Giovanni Bellini executed for this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mural paintings . . . had on other branches of the art . Berenson referred to Giovanni as " that great but unconscious revolutionary " who developed the method by which color became " the chief if not sole instrument with which his effects were to be produced , " although he had " passed through an initial phase of intense precision of outline . " It was with Giovanni that the genius of the family flickered out . There had existed , indeed , one other painter , almost certainly connected with the family , but not gifted : Leonardo Bellini , who was born around 1425 and apparently remained active well into the second half of the fifteenth century . Some say that he was a nephew and some say that he was a grandson of Jacopo , great original chief of the artist clan . But he was never seen as notable ; indeed , his miniatures appear to be his most considerable contribution to the gaudy burst of Renaissance painting . There is no evidence that he was ever an intimate member of the Rellini family nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great trio of father and sons Jacopo , Gentile , and Giovanni , on the other hand , represented the sperm , the body and the soul of the luminous , long-lasting school of Venetian art . Apart from the enduring greatness of the Bellini clan , its mere existence demonstrates that on rare occasions splendid painters can hand on the torch of their talents by normal genetic vigor as has been demonstrated among families in other fields , such as Philip and Alexander as strategists or the two Dumas as writers . I know of no other cluster of intimately related painters who managed to achieve enduring fame . But there can be no doubt that it was advantageous , for Gentile and Giovanni Bellini , inheriting that flash of genius passed on by their parents ' loins , were able to benefit from the teachings of their father , Jacopo , and perhaps their brother-in-law , Mantegna , to polish their natural genius , and to achieve immortality themselves and through their own pupils , like Titian and Giorgione . Yet , in its conception and form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic talent . My thought throughout has been the juxtaposition of any father with his children and how , if such proved to be the case , one generation 's genius or malevolence ? at any rate , an outstanding talent ? manifested itself in its immediate descendents . Sometimes , as in the case of Philip and Alexander , it has been a furious bonfire of genial explosion . In others , such as Alexander VI and Cesare Borgia , it has been a blazing malevolence . Surely there are many more paired occasions of sire and offspring less melodramatic and therefore less known , when a sturdy , talented , noble stream of goodness and ability has flowed from one bloodstream to its successor ? like the flamboyant but magnificently virtuous Adams family of Massachusetts or the gifted , joy-giving Bellini family in Venice . Jacopo , the first artistic clan chief , bequeathed to his two brilliant sons , Gentile and Giovanni , through his own genes and his personal example , one of history 's few family testaments of beauty .  | Mafia in the Vatican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the famous Sicilian terrorist brotherhood , the Mafia , is known as " the Family " and generally associated with evil and racketeering , in both of which it has customarily displayed great skill and ardor . A considerable number of its members have graduated to positions of wealth , power , and social eminence after the ugliest , most immoral , and most sordid of beginnings . But the taste for lawlessness , avarice , murder , bribery , kidnapping , rape , torture , and every vile aspect of crime had its greatest and ( one must admit , most garish ) familial success in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries when the Hispano-Italo clan of Borgias took over the Holy See and the Papal States under the pope 's secular administration , climbing to the highest degree of Renaissance prestige , holding vast temporal influence , immense wealth , and a political clout that redounded throughout Europe . At the same time , the Borgia clan was undoubtedly the most wicked center of its era and certainly the most wicked that ever gained control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one might argue that it was morally even more wicked than that other Spanish organization , the Inquisition , which applied its widespread sadistic tortures in the name of God to press Catholic orthodoxy 's cause . As Orville Prescott has written : The reasons for the moral decline of the Church in the Renaissance were many and dated back well into the Middle Ages . During the absence of the popes in Avignon and during the Great Schism much of Italy suffered a political state of near anarchy . The distant popes seemed far more'intent on collecting funds 108  | and on imposing their rule by military conquest than on exercising the spiritual leadership of their exalted office . The cardinals and legates they sent from France to Italy did much to debase the reputation of the Church . When the popes returned to Rome from Avignon early in the fifteenth century , conditions in Italy were only a little better . It was plain to all the popes that the papacy as an institution and even their own lives were not safe unless the temporal power of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be absolute rulers of the city of Rome but that wherever possible they should rule the states of the Church directly and not just through nominal vicars . The larger the area the popes actually governed , the safer the Church would be . So all the popes waged wars and some of them ? notably Sixtus , Innocent , Alexander and Leo ? waged them to make their relatives princes under papal supremacy . Everywhere , in all religions , more slaughter has been done in the name of God since the concept of divinity was invented by men in prehistoric times , than in any other name : war , storm , earthquake , greed , territory , gold , sex , or any abstract ideology . Sect has murdered sect ? as in The Thirty Years ' War ? ever since humanity 's dawn . Moslems have slain heathens ; Hindus have slain Moslems , and Buddhists have been slain by Hindus ; Jews have been slain by Christians , and Mohammedans by Jews ? all in the various names of God , be he Allah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jews mowed down Philistines and , centuries later , were incinerated by Nazi neopagans . Among the worst examples I know of cruel death associated with theological creed is the assassination on a diabolical scale of Protestant sects by hired mercenaries in medieval France and the disgusting excesses of satanic murder committed by the family of the Borgia Pope Alexander VI in Rome ? without even vague reference to holiness . Indeed , had it not been for the surfeit of wicked excesses developed by the Roman Church during Alexander 's papacy ? the ostentatious lewdness , the publicly carnal orgies , encouraged by this most diabolical of any pontiff in a diabolical era , the mass sale of indulgences , the murder , torture , and cynical double-crossing in which Church leaders figured prominently ? and if , at approximately the same time , King Henry VIII of England had not yearned to satisfy his pride and royal tradition by producing a legitimate male heir , quite conceivably the Protestant Reformation might never have assumed so violent and widespread a tenor . It could have simply petered out  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the king or the pope and Luther to live up to their sworn responsibilities : an imaginary version of Pope John XXIII in Rome , a neo-Erasmus among the Teutons , and a latter-day male Elizabeth in London after Henry 's divorce received papal approval . Without the almost simultaneous impacts of Alexander and Henry , there might have been no such dramatically extensive a rebellion in Christianity , sponsored by two political superpowers with an indignant inquisitorial reaction . But too vast a storm of outrage against what is today symbolized by the non- or anti-religious activities of a pope and a Christian king broke down the shards of any tradition of unity left in Christendom 's major societies . The collapse of a previously established society was overwhelming Europe on a piecemeal basis as the Turks destroyed Constantinople and eastern Christianity , Spain moved in the direction of unifying the Hispanic states , and France pulled itself together as a great power . But Italian energies were dissipated in fraternal quarrels among the various Italianate governments or external empires . Meanwhile , general morality vanished together with traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style on his way up the ladder of command . He was known for his vigorous personality and untrammeled physique as well as for a dignified and noble presence ? when desirable . No one questioned his perspicacity , astuteness , or ambition , his persuasive ability or his capacity in the management of difficult problems . Throughout his career he was prepared to join Iberian toughness to complete lack of principle , and he made a personal fortune out of his ecclesiastical career before he ever became pontiff . The Borgia family 's initial prominence in the international field came from a methodical jurist in southern Spain , Alfonso Borja ( the Spanish spelling ) who , even before he was a priest , was named a bishop and , in 1444 , a cardinal in payment for his aid in dethroning the antipope . With the assistance of secular chiefs indebted to him , he raised himself to the Holy See in 1455 , choosing the name Calixtus III when he tottered to the throne at the age of seventy-seven . He sought to crown his reign by achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , and raising a great crusade to regain Constantinople from the Moslem Turks . His first objective was soon traditional among Borgia chieftains . During the period of Borgia eminence , the tribe managed to produce two popes , five cardinals , and numerous bishops shoved to power in that most immoral of pI I I times . Later , one modest Borgia , Francesco , was canonized. * The springboard of their distinction was Xativa , a small town near the port of Gandia in Valencia , southern Spain , where the dukes of Borgia ( the Italian spelling ) and their coat of arms , a bull in a golden field , were honored for helping the King of Aragon conquer the Valencians . The second objective was always at auction for a price . The papal secretary of Calixtus ? for a handsome fee ? had the family relationship officially " distanced " between an illustrious French count , Jean d'Armagnac , and his sister so they could " legally " marry . The pope saw to it that one third of the 24 million ducats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nephew Rodrigo ? eventually himself pope as Alexander V I ? for his role in arranging this dirty affair . Calixtus managed to have two nephews , Rodrigo and Pedro Luis , sons of his sister , raised to the cardinalate once they had agreed to accept his surname , Borgia . He set the family pattern in the Holy See by naming Pedro Luis , captain-general of the papal citadel of Sant'Angelo , then governor of a handful of important cities , and finally prefect of Tuscany . Each of these posts went for a price in ducats . Only one single cardinal , the pious Capranica , objected ? utterly in vain . As Alexander VI he had a reputation as a shrewd politician and administrator . He was handsome , eloquent , and wielded an insidious charm ; few influential people caviled at his lack of religious feeling and neglect of ecclesiastical obligations . He at once betrayed the inordinate Borgia passion for family advancement , and in all , five members of the Borgia clan received the red cardinal 's hat during his tenure . Rodrigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of his particular preference for female saints . Already when in Valencia and not yet widely famed , he was renowned for his " gay features and happy air , " which earned him enormous popularity with attractive women . And in the corrupt fifteenth century , when even the Church had been increasingly infected , nobody expected a handsome young cardinal to observe his vows of chastity with serious rigor . Few people saw anything odd in the fact that the young prelate , barely thirty , danced publicly in " dissolute fashion " or amused himself in the same ? Francisco de Borja y Aragon , a sixteenth-century duke ( of Gandia ) who became a Jesuit after his wife 's death , was canonized in 1671 , in all probability because he was backed by the influential Jesuitical order and by Church figures who wished to show that there may have been some maxi in the Borgia mafia .  | licentious way as his seventy-year-old uncle , the pope . Nevertheless , the Mantuan chronicler , Schivenoglia , was depressed at the fact that Rodrigo , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of committing every evil . " Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia clung steadfastly to his hunger for richness and power . At the same time , he displayed intelligence and superb tact when required , as in negotiating the marriage of Ferdinand , King of Aragon , and Isabella , Queen of Castille . He was a pronounced favorite of Ferdinand and became famed for his sumptuous way of life . The only restraint in his taste for excesses , even while pope , was limitation to a simple , restricted diet of food . Even his son Cesare and his nephew Cardinal Monreale subsequently regarded it as a penitence to dine with the Holy Father , Alexander VI . Rodrigo had no taste for literature or poetry but adored music and above all the dance . He was an exceptionally mundane cardinal , even for that epoch , and enjoyed hunting , carnivals , the theater , and licentious public displays . Like most princes of the Church , he was also renowned as a heavy gambler . Cardinal Borgia lived openly and luxuriously in Rome with Vanozza di Catanei , titular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Subsequently , he had the same relationship with Giulia Farnese , known as " La Bella , " titular wife to Orsino Orsini . In both cases ? above all after Rodrigo became " Holy " Father himself ? these menages were acknowledged by everyone . " La Vanozza , " as she was called , mothered his children and thereafter did all in her power to assist their advancement . Rodrigo first met her in Mantua in 1461 and was overwhelmed by her charm and beauty , while Vanozza responded to his handsome magnetism . Their daughter , Lucrezia , famed for her loveliness as well as for the evil spoken of her , was said to have her mother 's straight nose and her father 's strong chin . It is probable as well that Lucrezia inherited her clear blue eyes and long silky golden hair from Vanozza , who also gave her clerical lover three other children : Cesare ; Giovanni , the second Duke of Gandia ( his father , Rodrigo , was the first to hold the title ) ; and Gioffre , prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was simultaneously the mistress of his two brothers ) . As was then the custom , Cardinal Rodrigo started moving Cesare up the road to glory at a precocious age . When only seven , he was named apostolic protonotary and canon of Valencia , rector and archdeacon . Later , Innocent VIII did Cesare 's father a favor by making the son bishop of Pamplona .  | Cardinal Rodrigo , the Spaniard , was elected Pope Alexander VI in 1492 , Spain 's annus mirabili , when Columbus discovered America , and Ferdinand captured Granada and , jointly with his wife , expelled all Moors and Jews . In order to celebrate , Cesare Borgia organized a bullfight before the Vatican . Several other candidates for the papal throne had been backed with huge sums by rival lay potentates seeking political influence ; holiness did n't weigh much in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . What the pope needed more was a strong character , largesse to buy votes , and strategically placed , well-armed friends around Europe . When Rodrigo Borgia , possessing all these attributes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , took the name of Alexander , he was sixty-two years old , yet still a strong , lusty figure of a man . As the gong of the Capitol resounded while his papacy was proclaimed , a huge mob gathered , surging slowly toward the Holy See , and the cardinals gravely formed up to render homage . It was indeed hard for destiny to look ahead . The new pontiff was clever , experienced , a hard worker , a consummate man of the world , a fine diplomat , strong , possessor of unusual charm , dignified , and an eloquent orator . But a great many of those present also knew well the corrupt circumstances and outright purchase which had produced this scandalous choice . Nevertheless , as suitable to Borgia tastes , the prossessio or procession from the Vatican to the Lateran and the papal coronation were unusually splendid and worthy of a handsome , noble Pontiff . A protonotary had written in large letters on an arch erected over his house : " Rome was great under Caesar , now she is greater ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a God . " ( A rather pretentious claim by a highly immodest pseudoclerk on behalf of a man who only called himself Christ 's vicar . ) A witness described Alexander as " worthy of the occasion . He rode a horse white as snow , with a serene forehead and majestic dignity . " A member of the snobbish Porzio family described him as tall , with a skin neither too ruddy nor too pale , black eyes and heavy lips . He was strikingly eloquent . Even in this grand prossession the public for the first time got a hint that the new , less-than-holy father was subject to occasional physical strokes of the type known as syncopes . Despite his vitality and vigor , he suddenly fainted with apparent fatigue at the entrance to the Lateran basilica and had to be supported to the altar by a pair of cardinals until he was brought back to consciousness by dashes of cold water in the face .  | This seems to be the first Roman public display of an embarrassing weakness for an energetic man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aware of this strange fallibility during his days as a cardinal . In subsequent papal processions , he was stricken several times by the same peculiar illness . For that reason the pontiff did his utmost to discourage fatiguing ceremonials . He began his pontificate with what appeared to many to be excellent intentions . Several diplomats reported his desire to reform the papal court , reestablish peace in Italy , and take up his uncle 's expressed quest to march in a crusade against the Turks . But such promise was disappointed . Alexander proceeded to fill the important offices of the Vatican with rich personal clients including what was regarded as an excessive number of Spaniards . During the procession , the young Cardinal Medici murmured into his neighbor 's ear : " Let us flee . We 're in the gullet of the wolf ; he 'll devour us all . " Within days , pious Romans were confiding to each other that Borgia 's elevation was a proof of the anger of God , as the Dominican Friar , Girolamo Savonarola , had foreseen ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravaging troops of France 's King Charles VIII . The Florentine envoy remarked sourly that there was no joy in Rome and added that yet another Spaniard had little chance of becoming popular . No popes of the period were exactly renowned for conforming to the proprieties and behavior suited to that supreme religious post , but Alexander was by far the worst . He demonstrated that a Borgia in the Vatican was a far greater evil than would be the presence of an Al Capone or a Lucky Luciano in the modern American White House . Alexander 's tenure clearly had a malign effect on the position of the Church vis-a-vis the gathering forces of Reformation . Seventeen years after Alexander 's death , Martin Luther wrote of the pontificate : " I do not admit that I owe any obedience to the Pope by then Leo X .... I hate that man of sin and son of perdition , with all his kingdom which is nothing but sin and hypocrisy . " The German said of the Holy See : " It is more scandalous and shameful than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond all counsel and help . " He might have been composing the first electric telegraph message , sent three centuries later : " What hath God wrought ? " The Lutherans began to identify the papacy with the " great whore " and the pope with the Antichrist himself . Alexander displayed an uninhibited taste for nepotism . Cesare was promoted from his modest see in Pamplona to the great bishopric of Valencia , despite the anger of King Ferdinand , who began to recognize  | dangers of his own dynastic position with the growing prestige of his former Borgia favorites . The new pope also named his nephew , Giovanni BorgiaLancol , Bishop of Monreale . Alexander decided to employ the beautiful Lucrezia to further family political advancement , although she was still only eleven years old . Despite her youth , she already knew a surprising amount about sex , having , it was said , witnessed at close hand many of the antics of her holy parent . But the original engagement desired for her by Alexander was deferred . While these proceedings occurred , Alexander 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only papal offspring ever born actually inside the Vatican itself . Shortly thereafter , Alexander 's agents arranged that Lucrezia should marry a Spanish nobleman , the son of the proud Count d'Aversa ; but this proposition also fell through as a result of Alexander 's shifting political ambitions . She was eventually wedded to Giovanni Sforza , Lord of Pesaro in the Romagna , a widower twice the age of his lovely golden-haired wife , by this time thirteen . Because of her youth it was agreed ( for a sum ) that the ceremony would be delayed for one year . When the event finally took place , such were the celebrations which followed that one observer asserted that the pope , then sixty-three , behaved as actively as he had when but a twenty-eight-year-old cardinal . This marriage was eventually annulled and the ravishing Lucrezia was handed on , for dynastic reasons , to Alfonso , Prince of Biseglia . He was subsequently strangled after his father lost his throne as king of Naples . The murderer was Cesare 's most proficient and highly paid assassin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucrezia was married in 1502 to the crown prince of Ferrara and finally died in childbirth , leaving behind a legend compounded of lust , lechery , incest , beauty , and slavish devotion to her evil father . She was almost certainly less wicked than totally feeble and pliable , and it is unlikely that she was , in fact , much maligned by the most exaggerated rumors concerning her tainted morals , and sometimes quietly devilish behavior . Giovanni , said sometimes to be Cesare 's son , sometimes the pope 's own , was given the dukedoms of Camerino and Nephi . Alexander 's grandson , by Iucrezia , became duke of Sermoneta . On September 20 , 1493 , Cesare was made a cardinal , thus further strengthening his own and his family 's position . Alexander used the occasion to make a curious gesture toward propriety , in honor of his own bastard son ;  | he published a bull proclaiming the legitimacy of Cesare as son of Vanozza and her then-husband , Domenico d'Arignano , this formality making him technically more eligible for the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising power among the divided Italian states , the French king , Charles VIII , invaded Italy and stirred up a hornet 's nest of trouble . The French invaders were the first army in Europe to haul a wagon-train of cannon on a long campaign . These frightened the Italians increasingly as they smashed down the strongest stone walls of their citadels . A few years later , the great poet Ariosto was to ask : " How did this infamous and ugly invention ever find a place in human hearts ? " It had been a dismal omen for the pope when his old rival in the Sacred College , the tough , fighting Cardinal Della Rovere , initiated a fruitless negotiation for an alliance with Sultan Bajezet of Turkey against the " most Christian " monarch , Della Rovere 's host , the French king . While still a cardinal , Alexander had employed the Spanish against the French and vice versa . Although mindful of his relative Calixtus III 's hope to raise a new crusade against the Turks , he had continually made secret compacts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by keeping the Ottoman emperor 's brother , Prince Djem , prisoner and charging the Supreme Porte 40,000 ducats a year to support him in customary style . Djem , indeed , was permitted to hold his own Islamic court at the same time as Alexander staged his luxuriously dictatorial orgies or formalities in the Vatican . Bajazet became increasingly alarmed at the possibility Djem might lend himself to some scheme to seize the Ottoman throne , and eventually offered the Holy Father 300,000 ducats , together with what was said to be the tunic of Christ on which the Roman soldiers threw their dice before the cross , to have him murdered . But before Alexander could benefit from the offer , he was forced to dispatch the Turkish prisoner to the King of France , in the great game of treachery . On the last day of 1494 , Charles battered his way into Rome . While Alexander cowered behind the fortifications of Sant'Angelo , armored French knights , artillery , and terrifying regiments of Swiss and German mercenaries paraded unopposed . They stayed for one month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Alexander 's enemies among the cardinals were urging Charles to summon a council to depose the pope , what primarily interested the king was promise of papal backing for his planned projects of further conquest , and Alexander was frightened into agreeing that French forces could cross papal territory on their march southward to Naples .  | For a cardinal 's hat , Alexander suborned Briconnet , Charles 's confidential adviser . As a result , the king 's interest in a council was dropped . However , when Charles marched on to Naples , he took with him Cesare Borgia as a " legate " ? in reality a hostage for his father 's behavior ? and also Prince Djem . Djem died suspiciously soon at Charles 's camp near Naples . The French expedition was doomed to fail . It was not equipped for a continuing occupation and conquest . Charles 's army was immobilized in Naples , a prey to fever ; the Aragonese princes of that southern kingdom eluded him , and the people resorted to guerrilla warfare . Cesare escaped from supervision and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called Holy League , with Maximilian of Habsburg , Ferdinand of Spain , and Milan and Venice . Charles decided to retreat . Alexander VI was no fool ; he was simply a scabrous villain in what should have been the wrong profession . Unquestionably a talented man , he ended up as the most immoral , sexiest , most power-hungry , and vicious pope in the history of the Holy See , intelligent but not wise enough to understand that the antics he encouraged and himself practiced would split tip the Church whose unity he so much desired . His antiprophet was Savonarola , burned in Florence in flames that might better have consumed the Borgia chief . It is far from Alexander 's sole fault that the Catholic Church was in such miserable shape in the late fifteenth century . As the brilliant historian , John Addington Symonds wrote : All the Cardinals , with the exception of Rodrigo Borgia , were the creatures of Pope Sixtus or of Innocent VIII . Having bought their hats with gold , they were now disposed to sell their votes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest , wisest , and most worldly of them all . He ascertained exactly what the price of each suffrage would be and laid his plans accordingly . Yet the gang installed by the ambitious , ruthless new pontiff and headed by his attractive but detestable son Cesare used its new positions and increasing immorality to establish in the name of the Church a hateful , tyrannical rule that exceeded anything hitherto practiced even in the worst-run temporal states of Italy . Cesare personally hunted down the important Varani family and murdered almost all its male members . After capturing Roenza , he publicly insulted and then drowned or strangled its leaders , who were brought to Rome . His agents told him the Bishop of Cetta , in France , had repeated one of  | Cesare 's secrets ; so he had him poisoned . On behalf of his father , he bribed Cardinal d'Amboise in order to maintain Borgia credit with Louis XII , who had succeeded Charles VIII as French king . The combined policy devised by Alexander and executed by Cesare used the pope 's theoretical spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder and assassination , dictated diplomacy , and threats of the most menacing sort against potential personal opponents . Papal pressure sought to dismember nations to the profit of the house of Borgia ? by fraud , blackmail , and sacrilege . No such persistent and widespread evil could endure , even in the lax , immoral licentiousness of cynical Renaissance Italy , and the final knell was sounded , according to common report , when Alexander and Cesare invited themselves to dinner with Cardinal Adriano of Corneto in his vineyard . It was rumored that Adriano 's butler had garnished the affair with goblets of poisoned wine . Either by mistake or with the deliberate connivance of Adriano , the wine was allegedly served to the self-invited guests ? who choked in agony and died . This is the version believed by the well-informed gossip Cinthio . Francesco Guicciardini adds that " all Rome ran with indescribable gladness " to see the papal corpse . There is no doubt that at least the portion of the tale referring to Cesare is untrue . He outlived Alexander by four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1507 . Guicciardini and others believe Alexander actually died a victim of some malevolent illness , a black and swollen mass . The Marquis of Mantua wrote his wife : " In his sickness the Pope talked in such a way that those who did not know what was in his mind thought him wandering , though he spoke with great feeling , and his words were : I will come ; wait yet a little while . ' " This was alleged by gossip to be addressed to Satan . Regardless of the cause of death , Guicciardini , the great sixteenthcentury statesman-historian , summarized accordingly : So ended Pope Alexander , at the height of glory and prosperity about whom it must be known that he was a man of the utmost power and of great judgment and spirit , as his actions and behavior showed . But as his first accession to the Papacy was foul and shameful , seeing he had bought with gold so high a station , in like manner his government disagreed not with this base foundation . There were in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh and spirit ; nor could there be imagined in the ordering of the  | Church a rule so bad but that he put it into working . He was most sensual toward both sexes , keeping publicly women and boys , but more specially toward women ; and so far did he exceed all measure that public opinion judged he knew sexually Madonna Lucrezia , his own daughter , toward whom he bore a most tender and boundless love . He was exceedingly avaricious , not in keeping what he had acquired , but in getting new wealth ; and where he saw a way toward drawing money , he had no respect whatever ; in his days were sold at auction all benefices , dispensations , pardons , bishoprics , cardinalships , and all court dignities : unto which matters he had appointed two or three men privy to his thought , exceeding prudent , who let them out to the highest bidder . He caused the death by poison of many cardinals and prelates , even among his intimates , those namely whom he noted to be rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of seizing their wealth . Guicciardini stressed his brutal cruelty and lust for violent murder : There was in him no religion , no keeping of his troth : he promised all things liberally , but stood to nought but what was useful to himself : no care for justice , since in his days Rome was like a den of thieves and murderers : his ambition was boundless , and such that it grew in the same measure as his state increased : nevertheless , his sins meeting with no due punishment in this world , he was to the last of his days most prosperous . He recounted his personal career : While young and still almost a boy , having Calixtus for his uncle , he was made Cardinal and then Vice-Chancellor : in which high place he continued until his Papacy , with great revenue , good fame , and peace . Having become Pope , he made Cesare , his bastard son and bishop of Pamplona , a Cardinal , against the ordinances and decrees of the Church , which forbid the making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherefore he brought proof by false witnesses that he was born in wedlock . Afterwards he made him a layman and took the Cardinal 's  | dignity from him to qualify Cesare as duke of Valentinois and turned his mind to making a realm ; wherein he fared far better than he purposed , and beginning with Rome , after undoing the Orsini , Colonnesi , Savelli , and those barons who were wont to be held in fear by former Popes , he was more full master of Rome than ever had been any Pope before . With greatest ease he got the lordships of Romagna , the March , and the Duchy ; and having made a most fair and powerful state , the Florentines held him in much fear , the Venetians in jealousy , and the King of France in esteem . Then having got together a fine army , he showed how great was the might of a Pontiff when he had a valiant general Cesare and one in whom he can place faith . At last he grew to that point that he was counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one word he was more evil and more lucky than ever for many ages per-adventure had been any pope before . " Some Roman rumor-mongers asserted that Alexander had bargained with the devil at the time of the cardinals ' conclave that elected him and had sold his soul on the basis that he would retain the Holy See twelve years , and that seven devils were seen in his death chamber as he expired . The pope 's son was an exceptional man , despite his extraordinary wickedness . His personal motto was Aut Caesar aut nihil ( " Either Caesar or Nothing " ) . He was not only well-connected and trained by a master of unscrupulousness , his father , but he was highly intelligent , versatile , and ruled by limitless ambition . He had been born a bastard , illegally legitimized to become a cardinal , and then had his relationship with the Church formally severed to qualify him for a dukedom . He was brave , strong , handsome , most attractive to women , and an extraordinarily fine athlete who could fell an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marksmanship well-honed by shooting down selected convicts in the Vatican courtyard . He would name his target , then choose a fatal point , and slaughter the cowering victim while his father , the pope , and his goldenhaired sister , Lucrezia , looked on in admiration . There is no doubt that even the wise , shrewd , broadminded Niccolo Macchiavelli was dazzled by this lusty prince of the Church , and the Florentine diplomat and scholar Guicciardini somehow managed to obscure to his own moral sensitivity some of the shrewd judgments he made on Cesare . Both writers , contemporaries of their subject , were overwhelmed by their own assumption that , after all , politics was but a means to an end . Macchiavelli , the famous Florentine statesman , political analyst , thinker , and dramatist and writer chose Cesare as a model for his " Prince , " because he foresaw ( perhaps correctly ) that he was the type of leader best suited to unify the eternally quarrelsome , violent and amoral Italian states , neither endowed with the remotest sense of nationhood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what their Roman ancestors had achieved in establishing a splendid empire . Macchiavelli was dispatched on two occasions to seek to stave off the menaces Cesare was concocting against the magnificent city-state of Florence . On the first ( 1502-3 ) , he was impressed if appalled by the ferocious manner in which Cesare dealt with a group of mutinous captains at Sinigaglia . The second time he encountered Cesare was after the death of Pope Alexander VI , followed swiftly by that of his successor , Pope Paul III . Macchiavelli had been sent by Florence to observe events at the conclave which soon elected the dour , martial Julius II . During this last personal view of the historical drama , he witnessed with mounting scorn and deception the inglorious decline of his chosen " Prince . " And when the latter was finally imprisoned by the new powers that were , Macchiavelli commented that this was a fate he " deserved as a rebel against Christ . " His philosophy of history , while sound , had been too much influenced by the evil and corruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Macchiavelli shrewdly observed in The Prince that Cesare 's history showed both the weakness and strength of fate . He wrote : " He acquired his dominion by the aid derived from his father 's position , and when he lost that lie also lost his power , notwithstanding that he used every endeavor and did all that a prudent and able man ought to do in order to plant himself firmly in those states which the arms and fortune of others had placed at his disposal . " The objective of Macchiavelli in stressing these points was to caution his employer-ruler , Lorenzo de ' Medici , against the mistakes that eventually brought Cesare down . Symonds , looking back from the mid-nineteenth century with its more acute appreciation of morality and less willingness to tolerate evil as a means to success , wrote in his Renaissance in Italy : The cruelty of Cesare Borgia was only equalled by his craft ; and it was by a supreme exercise of his power of fascination that he lured the foes who had plotted against him at La Magione into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , duke of Gravina , Vitellozzo Vitclli , and Oliverotto da Fermo were all  | 2 men of arms , accustomed to intrigue and to bloodshed , and more than any one of them were stained with crimes of the most atrocious treachery . Yet such were the arts of Cesare Borgia that in i 502 he managed to assemble them , apart from their troops , in the castle of Sinigaglia , where he had them strangled . Having now destroyed the chiefs of the opposition and enlisted their forces in his own service , Cesare , to use the phrase of Macchiavelli , " had laid good foundations for his future power . " He commanded a sufficient territory ; he wielded the temporal and spiritual power of his father ; he was feared by the princes and respected by the people throughout Italy ; his cruelty and perfidy and boldness caused him to be universally admired . But as yet he had only laid foundations . The empire of Italy was still to win ; for he aspired to nothing else , and it is even probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the principal barrier to Cesare 's design . Louis XII ( successor to Charles VIII ) was at last fearful of the danger , but since Louis had invited the Spaniards into Naples , Cesare possessed a way to rid himself of French control . He turned to Spain , and then played off one monarchy against the other to his own benefit . Then he took four precautions to the great admiration of Macchiavelli : In the first place , he systematically murdered the heirs of the ruling families of all the cities he acquired . By this process he left no scion of the ancient houses for a future Pope to restore . In the second place he attached to his person , by pensions , offices and emoluments , all the Roman gentry , so that he might be able to keep the new Pope a prisoner and unarmed in Rome . Thirdly , he reduced the College of Cardinals , by bribery , terrorism , poisoning , and packed elections , to such a state that he could count on the creation of a Pope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interests . Fourthly , he lost no time , but pushed his plans of conquest on with the utmost speed , so as , if possible , to command a large territory at the time of Alexander 's death . Cesare supplied Macchiavelli with a notable example of the uses of cruelty . Having found the cities of Romagna in disorder , he determined to quell them with a terrifying governor . And he chose Messr . Ramiro d'Orco , " a man cruel and quick of action , to whom he gave the fullest power . " But  | it did not suit Cesare to incur personally the discredit of cruelty . Accordingly , he had him decapitated and exposed to public view to prove his death . Macchiavelli wholly approved this formula : that cruelty should be employed for positive aims , but that the prince should shun the hatred it inspired . Macchiavelli 's ethics were based upon a conviction that men are altogether bad . When discussing the question , he decided : " It is far safer to be feared than loved , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally that they are ungrateful and changeable , dissemblers , apt to shun danger , eager for gain ; as long as you serve them , they offer you everything , down to their very children , if you have no need ; but when you want help , they fail you . " Two crimes supervised by Cesare that his ethically numb father could not forgive were the murder ( by stabbing and drowning ) of his brother , Alexander 's eldest son , the Duke of Gandia , and the stabbing of Perotto , the pope 's personal minion . The reason for Gandia 's assassination seems to have been a combination of jealousy and assurance for Cesare himself of priority in the Borgia family . The pontiff , when he learned the news , broke into a torrent of screaming anger , keeping to his bedroom and howling like a dog . As for Perotto : imagine the head of the Roman Church clasping his homosexual lover as his son , Cesare , sprang out and stabbed the boy so that blood splattered the papal robes as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Giovanni of Gandia , a powerful secular prince who might even aspire to the throne of Naples . But this hope vanished after Cesare 's thugs took care of the pontiff 's favorite , and the gossip marts of Rome filled with rumors that the two brothers had been rivals for the love of their beautiful sister , Lucrezia ( which report shows the destitute condition of Borgia Rome 's morality ) . The pope himself demonstrated that he was so awed by the terrible Cesare that , once his first torrents of rage and frustration had dried up , he suspended the official inquiry into Gandia 's assassination . From then on he labored to advance Cesare 's cause even more feverishly and sought his promotion to a secular principality , thus causing his departure from clerical ranks . In return for papal annulment of France 's King Louis XII 's first marriage and a dispensation for the second , plus tangible gifts , the king assured the pontiff he would no longer oppose papal dominance of Milan and Naples . Furthermore , as a supreme gesture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally with his dukedom of Valentinois ( Cesare became known to Italians as the " Duca Valentino " ) and married him off to the King of Navarre 's sister .  | Having thus completely reversed his policy toward France , Alexander resumed his quest for Borgia lands and power , using Cesare , the new duke , to overrun all Romagna with French weapons and strong mercenary support . The pope and his son pursued their basic strategy to insure possession of conquered areas : they captured the capitals and murdered the ruling princes : at Camerino , Sinigaglia , Bologna , Pesaro , Rimini , and Forli . Alexander VI was the man who made the Borgia family powerful by using all the advantages of his religious and temporal authority in the Church and the Papal States , and benefiting from the astonishing flabbiness of moral standards that prevailed in Medieval-Renaissance Italy . He was a stronger , firmer man than his predecessors and , according to Guicciardini , displayed " craft and singular sagacity , a sound judgment with extraordinary powers of persuasion ; and to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief . " His consuming ambition was to remove leaders who could threaten him and to eliminate their power bases whether in the Papal States , Naples , or Venice . A cynical sinner ( and wholly conscious of the fact ) , he tolerated public perversions that few lay potentates would have allowed even in those extraordinary days . And always he used his Spanish heritage and his own children to further his aims , even placing Cesare in the chief role after the latter had had his favorite oldest scion , the Duke of Gandia , murdered . For decades the entire moral scale of European society and its supposedly holy symbol , the papacy , had been rotting . It had become customary to buy bishoprics for youngsters who were n't even close to being priests , to designate cardinals with an eye to political support in distant parts , to raise huge sums by selling benefices and saintly relics . The saying was coined under Alexander : " He sells the keys , the altars , Christ . Well , he bought them , so he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rise to preeminence were nobles and hired thugs who used murder and poison as their tools . It is reckoned that Alexander 's men poisoned five cardinals and that , for example , on one single day in i 500 twelve red hats were auctioned off to those willing to support the Borgia power game and to pay for the privilege . Clearly , Guicciardini had Alexander VI in mind when he wrote : " In our corrupt times the goodness of a pontiff is commended when it does not surpass the wickedness of other men as Alexander 's did . But the morality of the Church before , after and above all during the pontificate of Rodrigo Borgia smelled like a cesspool. "  | Membership in the College of Cardinals had long become a political purchase , and many cardinals behaved simply like ward-heelers . Prince Alfonso of Portugal was named cardinal at seven ( with the limitation that he could not take office until fourteen ) and Cesare Borgia at eighteen . Macchiavelli ? whose realpolitik occasionally resembled , in some respects , Hitler 's ? wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , Italy has lost all piety and all religion whence follows infinite troubles and disorders ; for as religion implies all good , so its absence implies the contrary . " The primate of Christendom had come to be regarded as a secular potentate ? and of the most vicious , immoral variety . The crimes known to have occurred under Alexander ? the most famous of which were arranged or led by his son , Cesare , equaled only the cynical corruption of the Church itself . During Alexander 's pontificate , eighteen Spanish cardinals were created ? five of them from the house of Borgia . As for the pontiff 's personal behavior : Guicciardini judges him " most sensual toward both sexes . " Rodrigo Borgia was as astute as he was immoral . His most generous bequest to Cesare and Lucrezia , the two children who survived him and whom he adored , was the family power , obtained in true mafia fashion , and a profound legacy of licentious immorality , which they aped with great skill , plus the knowledge that they could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the true faith and blessed by God 's vicar on earth . Their father , the pope , set a gaudy personal example . No wonder they behaved as they did . Cesare was the incarnation of ruthless , sadistic immorality , and Lucrezia was a beautiful zombie prepared to sleep with or poison anyone if Alexander so desired . It would be quite outrageous for any serious person ? historian , statesman , theologian , or patriot  --  to even attempt to argue that Pope Alexander V I was a great churchman or even remotely useful or religious . He was a typically ambitious Renaissance noble , covetous , brave , greedy , licentious during an epoch when such was the accepted if not universally admired habit of that social breed . He was brilliant and he was wicked ; a lecher and a liar , not even true to his beloved family as witness the speed with which he transferred his affections to Cesare Borgia after the latter murdered his elder brother . To conclude , one may say of this two-generation mafia in the Holy City that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by Renaissance Mycenases to the leading artists of their era . Alexander VI has surely earned himself a unique position as the wickedest ixppc of a lot that was far from benevolent or saintly in his time ; and Cesare ,  | his son , became a mistaken literary hero for a moment in the most famous work of the most famous political philosopher of his day , but not before the latter worthy had regretted the character of his choice . Here , in truth , one may say , " Like father , like son . " Were these astounding characteristics acquired or inherited ? Surely ? and blazingly ? both . What a pope ! What a prince ! One conceived by Satan ; the other admired by " Old Nick " Macchiavelli.  | A Magician and His Manager : Leopold and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart On January 27 , 1756 , shortly before the outbreak of the Seven Years ' War , Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart was born in Salzburg . All his life he enjoyed being called Amade , short for " Amadeus " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in his family he was generally known as " Wolferl , " little Wolfgang . He was the youngest of seven children of whom only one other survived , Maria Anna , known as " Nannerl . " His father , Johann Georg Leopold Mozart , was a musician , composer , and teacher employed as a violinist in the establishment of Salzburg 's princearchbishop . Leopold 's musical talent was considerably below his cultivated knowledge of the medium . Leopold took a job as fourth violinist in the prelate 's orchestra and wrote a manual on the violin and how it should be played . He spent most of his life in Salzburg playing and giving lessons . He never rose above the hierarchical rank of deputy Kapellmeister in the archbishop 's establishment and consequently devoted himself to the passionate advancement of his brilliant son 's career . He developed a self-righteous belief that he had sacrificed himself for Wolferl . The little boy 's astounding talents first became evident at the age of three . Leopold had already started giving Nannerl lessons on the clavier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate her . When he was four his father began to teach him as well as his sister . The boy showed he could play various pieces correctly and also started to produce little compositions of his own . His first known attempt was a minuet in G. At four he composed a clavier concerto and also began playing the violin . At seven he asked if he could join a quartet at home as second violinist . His father found  | it difficult to teach the little boy because he already seemed to know everything by instinct . Wolfgang made his initial public appearance at Salzburg University at the age of five , and the following year , along with Nannerl , was taken by Leopold to Munich , where the two children played the harpsichord before the Elector of Bavaria . Leopold , who had failed in his own dream of finding fame and fortune in Salzburg , soon recognized that his own career lay in furthering that of his own children . Nannerl had immense talent ; but she was not a magical genius like Amadeus . Wolferl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infant prodigy only even remotely rivaled by Felix Mendelssohn half a century later ( but Mendelssohn 's adult talent never equaled that of the other boy genius ) . And Leopold had the discernment to recognize that his small son was more than a performing prodigy ; he was , indeed , an amazing creative musician . He trained the small boy to write manuscripts of his compositions in beautiful , orderly patterns . Johann Adolf Hasse , the veteran composer , observed that Leopold , " as far as I can see , is equally disconcerted everywhere . . . . He idolizes his son a little too much . " And the father failed to see the need for sufficient mental and physical rest for Wolferl and Nannerl . He confessed : " Every moment that it more now . You are aware that my children are used to work ; should they learn to make excuses ... my whole building would fall to the ground . Custom is an iron path . " Leopold admonished Wolferl that each moment of his learning time was priceless , equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to know everything before it was taught to him because of his astonishing musical intuition . Leopold was a good father and a thorough teacher . He was also a shrewd manager of the talent he was sponsoring and an excellent publicity man who busily circulated news about his remarkable children . He would surely have been happier if Wolfgang had achieved great renown in Salzburg , which would have brought fame and fortune to his father in encroaching old age . He was , indeed , a calculating opportunist . As he saw the need to extend his son 's renown and horizons , he planned for his conquest of Europe with precision and thoroughness . By the time Wolfgang was twelve , he had been paraded through England , France , Switzerland , and the Low Countries , in addition to the Habsburg cities of Munich and Vienna . In 1769 , when Amadeus was only thirteen , Leopold began devoting an increasing proportion of his time to him at the expense of the public life of Nannerl , who had grown into a tall and beautiful young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had already , despite his youth , written half a dozen symphonies , three piano concerti , and two indifferent operas , apart from other works , and the father at last felt Amadeus was ready for an extended tour of music-loving Italy . At the end of 1769 , father and son journeyed to Italy and crossed from city to city along the extended peninsula . Leopold had obtained a leave of absence from his employer , the prince-archbishop , and set out to establish his boy as a youthful European genius . He steeped the youngster in all forms of Italian music and gave him a grounding enabling him to write operas in true Italian style , later joined in a new form of musical drama by combining it with the techniques of German Singspiel . Wolfgang learned new possibilities of song and the loveliness of varying types of church music . An instance of Wolfgang 's astonishing natural genius occurred when he and his father visited Rome during Holy Week 1770 . They went to hear the Miserere , and the boy listened intently . Afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire piece down from memory . Leopold wrote to his wife : " We have it ! . . . We shall bring it home with us . " Years after the instructive Italian tour , Leopold was to advise his son , by then a youth in Paris : It now depends solely on your good sense and your way of life whether you die as an ordinary musician , utterly forgotten by the world , or as a famous Kapellmeister , of whom posterity will read ? whether captured by some woman you die bedded on straw in an attic , full of starving children , or whether , after a Christian life spent in contentment , honor , and renown , you leave this world with your family well provided for and your name respected by all . At fifteen , Wolfgang had found himself at a relatively loose end , with no brilliant invitation on the horizon , and his thoughts began to turn toward Paris . During a childhood visit to Paris , he had written a concerto at the behest of the Duc de Guines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melchior Grimm , intimate of Diderot and lover of Madame d'Epinay . For this second trip to Paris , Leopold consigned his son to his mother 's care and gave them a long list of introductions to important people including members of the court of Louis XV . The most helpful of these proved to be Grimm , who later was named a baron under the Empire . Wolfgang took care to stay as close as possible to Grimm , heeding Leopold 's diplomatic counsel .  | " Life in Paris , " Wolfgang wrote , " is very different from life in Germany , and the French ways of expressing oneself politely , of introducing oneself , of craving patronage , etc. are quite peculiar ; so much so that Baron von Grimm used always to instruct me as to what I should say . " The trip was arduous as was always the case in those days . Passengers crowded into a coach from dawn to dusk bumping along rutted , dangerous roads and sleeping in dirty inns , filled with vermin . When they reached Paris , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spattering slime and slops . Amade and his mother occasionally traveled in the relative luxury of sedan chairs . Wolfgang unsuccessfully sought a job , but , disdaining his father 's advice , declined one as organist at Versailles . His second visit to France wound up sadly : His mother died in lonely despair ; and a romance he had had earlier with Aloysia Weber , the sister of his future wife , Constanze , had ended unhappily . Wolfgang returned to Salzburg and humbly accepted a modestly paid post as cathedral organist for Archbishop Colloredo . Amadeus was indebted to Leopold for a respectable upbringing , an outstanding education , and a stimulating early development , but Mozart was not nearly so preoccupied as his parent in the prospects of posthumous fame . Unlike his father , he was not keenly aware of the concept of " posterity . " Leopold was capable of communicating his plans and building up visions of the future that seemed to hold little particular meaning for the boy . The father served his family as its head , a major domo , impresario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to join in the journey or not . He arranged accommodation and letters of credit and useful , well-phrased introductions . Some time after Wolfgang 's wedding to Constanze , Leopold wrote his son : " I think you should consider me your best friend rather than your father ; since I have proven a hundred times over that I was more concerned for your good fortune and pleasure than for my own . " He also wrote him : " Consider whether I have not always treated you kindly , served you as a servant his master ; even provided you with all possible entertainment and helped you to enjoy all honorable and seemly pleasures , often at great inconvenience to myself . " When Leopold 's original employer , the old archbishop , died , he was succeeded by Hieronymus , Graf Colloredo . The new prelate was stingy , unpopular , and showed a preference for foreigners in his employ . The father and manager of the prodigious son was a didactic and rather disagreeable man to his family and tended to marked servility toward those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an educated , ambitious man  | who was intelligent enough to be deeply disappointed in himself . But he threw himself energetically into the promotion and management of his son whom he proclaimed a " Wonder of Nature . " Out of a talented , sophisticated boy genius , he had created a perfect musician . But even when the son was living far from restrictive Salzburg , Leopold sought to guide his behavior along unpleasant lines . Thus he wrote to him : " I recommend you to think when at work not only of the musical but also of the unmusical public . You know that for ten true connoisseurs there are a hundred ignoramuses ! Do not neglect the so-called popular style which tickles long ears . " He added subsequently : " Do your best to keep the whole orchestra in good humor ; flatter them , and by praising them , keep them all well-disposed toward you . " Although a cultivated man , Leopold had suffered enough disappointment to consider bowing and scraping a useful habit worthy of his boy 's adoption . For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even doting parent , who preached temperance and respect for virtue in a loose age and a sophisticated environment . He carefully warned Wolfgang against sexual promiscuity , which , he cautioned , almost invariably resulted in disease . Years later when , despite his father 's disapproval , he was engaged to be married , Wolfgang wrote to his father of his intended married life : I simply can not live as most young men do in these days . In the first place , I have too much religion ; in the second place , I have too great a love of my neighbor and too high a feeling of honor to seduce an innocent girl ; and , in the third place , I have too much horror and disgust , too much dread and fear of diseases and too much care for my health to fool around with whores . So I can swear that I have never had relations of that sort with any woman ... . I assure you that I am often obliged to spend unnecessarily , simply because I do not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should manage better with a wife ( on the same income which I have now ) than I do by myself . And how many useless expenses would be avoided ! True , other expenses would have to be met , but ? one knows what they are and can be prepared for them ? in short , one leads a well-ordered existence . A bachelor , in my opinion , is only half alive . She is not ugly , but at the same time far from beautiful . Her  | whole beauty consists in two little black eyes and a pretty figure . She has no wit , but she has enough common sense to enable her to fulfill her duties as a wife and mother . Leopold 's distaste for Constanze ? he had even withheld permission for the marriage to occur ? made for an uneasiness in family relationships . In the end he had given only angry and tardy consent to the marriage . Leopold apparently took grim satisfaction in announcing he washed his hands of all financial responsibility for or aid to the young couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined together both my bride and I shed tears . All present , even the priest , were much moved , and all wept . " Wolfgang was understandably hurt that his father clearly disapproved of the marriage . He must also have been distressed by the frosty behavior of his father and sister when he visited Salzburg with his wife in 1783 . Constanze was given no presents , no appropriate gift , no kindness . Understandably , she never forgave Leopold and Nannerl , just as Nannerl never forgave her for marrying her brother . As old ladies in Salzburg , they lived near each other without ever even seeing one another . The one foreign capital Wolfgang yearned to revisit was London , where he had spent some time as a boy with his family . He had been attracted by the young king , George III , whose taste for plain living had suited his amiable wife , Queen Charlotte , before whom Wolfgang and Nannerl had performed . He had been enamored by the friendliness of the atmosphere , and later , during his wanderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English musicians and actors . The composer often thought of returning . When the great Joseph Haydn departed for England in 1790 , leaving his friend Wolfgang in Vienna , the latter had just declined an invitation from an opera promoter there . Although another was promised to him by Haydn 's mentor , Wolfgang never received it . This was a particular disappointment . In 1786 Mozart had suggested an English voyage to Constanze , but the two small children they now had posed a problem . So Wolfgang wrote his father proposing they leave the two babies with him in Salzburg while they were away . Leopold furiously refused . He wrote caustically to Nannerl : " Not at all a bad arrangement ! They would go off and travel ? might even die ? or stay on in England ? leaving me to run after them with the children . " He was scarcely a nice grandfather when the children involved were not proven geniuses ! Old age , however , did soften several of Leopold 's selfish bigotries . With  | his wife gone , he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own path . When he visited Wolfgang in Vienna he went with him several times , at first reluctantly , to meetings of the Freemasons with whose order his son was affiliated . Leopold finally joined himself , accepting the gentle pledge of brotherly love that was a sharp change from his previous acceptance of uncompromising dictation from the priesthood . On February 16 , 1785 , he wrote to Nannerl , with undisguised pride , that after an evening of chamber music in Wolfgang 's home , Haydn had come up to him and said : " I tell you before God , as an honest man , that your son is the greatest composer I know , either personally or by name . He has taste and moreover the greatest science in composition . " Death came for the grouchy , syncophantic old manager of the vibrant musical magician in the spring of 1787 , at a time when Amade himself had been suffering from bouts of illness and despondency and increasingly fatalistic moods . When he first heard from Nannerl that their father had fallen seriously ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need not tell you how greatly I long for reassuring news from yourself . Indeed I expect it , even though I have accustomed myself to expect the worst on all occasions . Since death , when we come to consider it , is seen to be the true goal of our life , I have made acquaintance during these last few years with this best and truest friend of mankind , so that his image not only no longer has any terrors for me , but suggests , on the contrary , much that is reassuring and consoling ! And I thank my God for blessing me with the opportunity ( you understand me ) of coming to recognize Him as the key to our true blessedness . Wolfgang was referring , of course , to the Masonic teachings that had replaced so many of his earlier unquestioning allegiances to church dogmas . The reflective son concluded : " But should you , against all expectation , be no better , I beg you will not . . . will not conceal it from me , but tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I can come with all human speed to your arms ! " However , when Wolfgang received the news that his father had died on May 28 , he was " neither astonished nor shocked . " His loyalty to his paternal promoter had been notable , but it had suffered a severe blow when Leopold 's selfishness made it impossible for him to go to England . Thus , the old man ? a bitter , prejudice-ridden figure ? died apart from his pride and joy , his   breadwinner . He had been instrumental in developing an uninhibited creative genius , although his bigotry and material greed seemed often to wreck it . Wolfgang had been a small child with weak limbs , a spindly body and an oversized head . He remained small and spindly all his life . But his accomplishments were such that , in an age that worshiped musical prodigies , his fame spread rapidly . At five , he wrote a minuet and a trio for the piano . At six , his father took him and Nannerl to Vienna , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Empress Maria Theresa heard him , she took him on her lap and embraced him . He was seven , " a little man with his wig and sword , " when the great Goethe saw him in Frankfurt . We know of no relations he had with other children save Nannerl , four and a half years older than Wolfgang . But the adult world was at his feet . His childhood was never normal . What one might term his " public life " started when he was five and played the part of a chorister at the Salzburg Gymnasium . From ages six to ten , he traveled constantly with his father and sister and never set foot in a schoolroom or learned anything save from and through his father . He adored arithmetic and scribbled formulas on tablecloths and wallpaper . Starting at six , he produced several short keyboard compositions . He enjoyed playing the violin or the clavier in chamber music ensembles arranged by Leopold . Oddly enough , considering his abnormal life , he was noted for an equable disposition . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve youthful years of arduous travel and public performance . Leopold advertised his children 's concerts abroad accordingly : The little girl , who is in her twelfth year , will play the most difficult compositions of the great masters , the boy , who is not yet seven , will perform on the clavecin or harpsichord ; he will also play a concerto for the violin , and will accompany symphonies on the clavier , the manual or keyboard being covered with a cloth , with as much facility as if he could see the keys ; he will instantly name all notes played at a distance , whether singly or in chords , on the clavier , or any other instrument , glass , bell , or clock . He will finally , both on the harpsichord and the organ , improvise as long as may be desired and in any key , thus proving that he is as thoroughly acquainted with the one instrument as with the other , great as is the difference between them .  | By his elders , he was respectfully treated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Johann Christian Bach , son of the great Johann Sebastian and music master to Queen Charlotte of England . He played before Louis XV of France , whose Versailles court welcomed him . He astounded distinguished audiences by playing perfectly on keyboards covered with a cloth . This was a trick first learned to please the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I. When he was eight and nine , while in London and the Hague , Mozart began the immensely complex job of writing symphonies . Mozart kept on improving the magical abilities with which he was born . At first he developed the ability to imitate proficiently the prevailing musical styles in the capitals to which his father took him ; but soon his creations became profoundly original and imaginative . His gift for the violin , the harpsichord , and the piano was formidable ; he could improvise in various styles , accompany at sight , add a bass to a given theme , and name any note that was sounded . His ear was perfectly attuned . In Rome the pope awarded him the Order of the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating duet with Johann Christian Bach when he was eight . At age eight , he also played for Madame de Pompadour in Paris and when she spurned his effort to embrace her , he piped up : " Who is this that does not want to kiss me ? The empress kissed me . " The arduous upbringing his father had given him produced positive results . When Leopold fell ill in England while the three were on tour , the little boy took advantage of the quiet prescribed and sat down with Nannerl and wrote his first complete symphony ? at age eight . This was followed by three more symphonies and several piano and violin sonatas . The big gap in the young musician 's life was friendships with peers . I le rarely saw people his own age and had the habit of mixing with adults who flattered him enthusiastically . Not until he was thirteen , when he was in Florence , did he meet an English boy of his years , Thomas Linley , also a musical prodigy ( if far inferior ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played violin duets . In his late teens , Wolfgang lost his heart to the half-English Nancy Storace , a fine singer . When he was twenty-one , he struck up a vivacious friendship in Munich with his cousin Maria Anna Thekla , whom he affectionately called by the diminutive for cousin , Basle . %'Wolfgang had a modest share of romantic involvements , and for a time was deeply enamored of Aloysia Weber , the daughter of Mannheim friends , A lovely girl with a beautiful soprano voice . She was quite uninterested . Some time after she had spurned him , the eager young musician courted her  | younger sister , Constanze , a rather attractive girl with whom he shared the rest of his short life . As he matured and became relatively less dependent on his father , Mozart loosened his ties with the straitened life of Salzburg . After a stormy interview , he was discharged by the archbishop , and spent an increasing amount of time in Vienna , despite Leopold 's contempt for that capital as having " no love for anything serious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dances , burlesques , harlequinades . " But it was a musical melting pot and had become an unparalleled home base for many great composers such as Haydn , Beethoven , Schubert , and , of course , Mozart himself . Of these , only Schubert was born there . In Vienna , Amade developed his famous friendship with Haydn , whom he later acknowledged as his equal and dubbed " Papa . " He used to play viola in a chamber music quartet in which Haydn was first violin . Soon after settling in Vienna , Mozart married Constanze , who bore him six children of whom only two survived infancy . But the composer 's family made his life more restrained . Wolfgang was regarded as a sensational pianist for several seasons , but he was not a great popular success as a composer , despite the discerning view of connoisseurs like Haydn . Although he had been brought up as a traveling man , a wanderer , once he settled in Vienna , Mozart 's habits became relatively more fixed . He was given a post as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( his predecessor , who had just died , Christoph Willibald Gluck , had been paid 2,000 ) . The job meant little more than writing dance music for imperial balls , yet he at least had a status in the royal service . He took occasional trips in search of employment or fame , especially to Berlin , where he had an affair with the beautiful soprano Henriette Baranius , and to Prague , which gave him more acclaim than any other metropolitan audience during his career . When Bondini , the manager of the Prague opera house asked Haydn , a few days after Wolfgang had left the Bohemian capital , if he would produce an opera buffa to succeed Mozart 's , Haydn with customary generosity replied : " It would be a risk to put myself in competition with the great Mozart . " It was opera that seemed to fascinate Mozart most in the realms of musical creation . He did not truly come into his own in this field until he found the proper librettist , despite lovely successes in comic opera and Singspiel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal creations , was Emanuel Conegliano , a converted Italian Jew known by his baptismal name , after the bishop who baptized him , Lorenzo l ) a Ponte . Lorenzo had actually been ordained a priest but scarcely ever performed that  | office . He was a literary adventurer who cut a swath in European society and hobnobbed with royalty . He wound up his varied career as professor of Italian at Columbia University in New York . Lorenzo was a friend of the scabrous Giacomo Casanova de Seingalt , and Casanova actually contributed some fragments of verse to the libretto prepared by Da Ponte for Don Giovanni . Don Giovanni was created as a literary character for opera by Da Ponte from a series of Spanish legends deriving from Don Juan Tenorio , who killed his commander after seducing the man 's daughter . The opera was written to order as a commercial product for Bondini in Prague . Both Da Ponte and his friend Casanova had earned scurrilous fame for their amatory exploits in various capitals . It was Da Ponte who also conceived for Mozart the operatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a first-rate theater poet . He said of their collaboration : " As fast as I wrote the words , Mozart set them to music . " Wolfgang had already demonstrated immense versatility by the time he settled in Vienna . He was certainly the Habsburg capital 's finest pianist , despite small hands that remained plump and white regardless of all the use he made of them . He also demonstrated amazing scope as a composer . Before he had teamed up with Da Ponte on what were to be his most famous operas , he had developed what was thought a " Turkish " style with such productions as The Abduction from the Seraglio , the first German comic opera . He proved adept at the Italian opera buffa and also spoken recitatives in Singspiel . Figaro rapidly became immortal in the German repertoire . Don Giovanni was more Italianate , and The Magic Flute was a true and brilliant German Singspiel , or music drama . He produced many concert scores such as the exquisite " Eine Kleine Nachtmusik , " a string serenade , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first in minuet time , took hold of Vienna . And he wrote several symphonies , a form that , like the quartet , he learned from Haydn whom he acknowledged as a master . Yet Mozart never achieved in Vienna , which prided itself on its sophistication , the enormous popularity he knew in Prague , where he was an idol and earned good money . Don Giovanni flopped in the Habsburg capital , and the Emperor Joseph said : " That opera is divine ; I should even venture that it is more beautiful than Eigaro . But such music is not meat for the teeth of my Viennese . " The Emperor Joseph had at first greeted Wolfgang cordially , but he showed no inclination to financial generosity . Indeed , the disgruntled Salzburger wrote : " These Viennese gentry ( by which I mean chiefly the emperor ) must not imagine that I am in the world purely for the sake of Vienna ! There is no  | monarch on the globe I would sooner serve than the emperor ? but I will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer , Antonio Salieri , a man of mediocre talent , saw to it that the royal princess was not taught by Amadeus . Joseph , an enlightened ruler , did not have the judgment to acknowledge Mozart 's true genius . As a consequence , Mozart 's financial situation deteriorated badly , and , as he was no longer in great demand , because of the absence of royal favor , his concert appearances dropped off . He needed funds , and he began to borrow , repeatedly asking his friends for loans . While Salieri was paid a handsome salary for his court functions , Mozart was limited to a pittance . He made some money by teaching , which he did not enjoy ( he even declined the honor of instructing the young Beethoven ) . His joys were limited , and he attended many tavern drinking bouts with chums like Da Ponte and the Storaces as well as enthusiastic Masonic rites with his brothers in the lodge . He had established the agreeable habit of Sunday morning open house where he harmonized with friends , but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber music was his special joy at the Sunday get-togethers ( although he was a master of every known form of composition ) . Wolfgang , while still a young man , was not strong enough to successfully resist the financial , emotional , and professional odds that were mustering against him . He grew thin , nervous and increasingly subject to the minor infections prevalent in an era that knew nothing about sanitation . He caught an illness that some believe was a kidney disease and others think was typhoid . At the end of November 1791 , he was confined to his bed , nursed by Constanze and her youngest sister Sophie . Early December of that year he died . The cause was later diagnosed as rheumatic fever . There has been much argument about the cause of his death . Some have claimed that the fatal disease was uremia , others that he was poisoned by the disagreeable Salieri , still others that he died of syphilis , for which he was being treated with mercury . Dr. Carl Vogel , his physician , reported that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to urinate . " By any standard , his death was premature , as he was but entering into a period that normally would have been highly productive . According to his wife , Wolfgang had been possessed for months by the idea that he was being poisoned : " I know I must die ; someone has been giving me aqua toffana a form of arsenic . " Salieri is said to have proclaimed on his own deathbed : " I did not poison Mozart . It is a pity to lose so great a genius , but his death is just as well for us . If he had lived , not a soul would have given us a crust of  | bread for our work . " Today the most common explanation is that the great composer expired of uremia , following kidney trouble . The great Mozart was buried in a Viennese pauper 's grave at a cost of eleven florins , twenty-six kreutzer , paid by his widow . Emperor Joseph authorized a benefit concert under his patronage and allowed Constanze a life pension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mozart 's manuscripts , she still needed to take in boarders to survive , for the musician had accumulated many debts and had been paid a mere pittance for Figaro , Don Giovanni , and The Magic Flute . The portrait of Mozart handed down through time in the form of letters , diaries and recollections indicate that although he was an extraordinary magician from the moment of birth , he was not a pleasant man . He was jealous , petulant , ungracious , disloyal , irritable , and resentful . But perhaps most unpleasant are the indications that he suffered from coprophilia , which is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as " undue interest in faeces and defecation . " Stefan Zweig , to the dismay of Mozart 's admirers , specifically calls coprophilia a part of Mozart 's erotic nature . It is adduced by those who insist on Mozart 's purity that in the eighteenth century , which he inhabited , the bodily functions and their organs were not called by their Latin names but by their vulgar ones . This may indeed be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to insist on coprophiliac tendencies even in his extensive correspondence . Thus ( translating literally from the German ) he signed a letter to Basle : " Believing and shitting are two very different things " and also , " W.A. Mozart , who shits without a fart . " To Constanze he evoked her " lovable , kissable little ass . " He told his mother , " Keep well my love . Into your mouth your ass you 'll shove . I wish you good night , my dear , but first shit in your bed and make it burst . " He dismissed Salzburg and the prince-archbishop with : " I shit on both of them . " Normal emotional cravings are infrequent in his correspondence such as this letter to Constanze written two years before his death , which describes an erection and adds : " Arrange your dear sweet nest very daintily , for my little fellow deserves it , indeed , he has really behaved himself quite well and is only longing to possess your sweetest .... Just picture to yourself that rascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at me questioningly . I , however , box his cars properly ? but the rogue is simple . . . and now the knave burns only more fiercely and can hardly be restrained . "  | Wolferl 's love for Basle was probably genuine and durable although it was translated from boyish passion to adult warm friendship . His adoration for Aloysia vanished before her indifference , but he persisted in his admiration for her magnificent singing voice . Unlike his friends Da Ponte and Casanova , Mozart does not seem to have had many women in his life . He certainly had abiding affection for Constanze , who displayed sympathy and understanding for his shifting musical moods . But she sometimes was tempted to stray from the path of virtue , and Wolferl wrote to her ( August 1789 ) : A woman must always make herself respected or else people will begin to talk about her . My love ! Forgive me for being so frank , but my peace of mind demands it as well as our mutual happiness . Remember that you yourself once admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know the consequences of that . Remember too the promise you gave to me . Oh , God , do try my love . Be merry and charming to me . Do not torment yourself and me with unnecessary jealousy . Believe in my love , for surely you have proof of it and you will see how happy we shall be . Rest assured that it is only by prudent behavior that a wife can enchain her husband . Adieu . Probably only three of Mozart 's feminine admirers may be conceived as having been his mistress . Apart from Henriette Baranius , there was Nancy Storace , the half-English girl with whom he maintained contact through the years despite the rarity of occasions when they met . She was perhaps the only woman who justified any jealousy on Constanze 's part . She married an English violinist , but separated from him and urged Mozart to come to England . The third , Magdalena Hofdemel , was the attractive young wife of Wolfgang 's Masonic lodge brother and his pupil on the piano . Beethoven once declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great an intimacy had existed between her and Mozart . " It is hard to enumerate and classify his male friends , many of whom were wholly inconspicuous and their existence was not recorded in history 's footnotes . Certainly the most loyal , most noble , and perhaps the most talented was Haydn , who was his faithful and uninhibited admirer for many years . An unknown Viennese named Michael Puchberg loaned him generous sums when he was hard up for money . Lorenzo Da Ponte was a true collaborator and operatic inspirer , and once Mozart had rid himself of the thought that the Italian librettist might be " in league " with the hated Salieri ,  | the two partners were on good terms . Suspicion and disloyalty were facets of Mozart 's character that were not agreeable . Oddly enough for a central European , Wolfgang 's only real circle of foreign friends was English-speaking : the Storaces ; Thomas Attwood , a twenty-year-old organist to whom he gave lessons ; and Michael Kelly , a Dublin-born tenor . Kelly wrote an interesting memoir of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael Kelly , Importer of Wines and Composer of Music . " Mozart wrote to his father in 1782 , after hearing of British naval victories off Gibraltar and off Trincomalee : " I have heard of England 's victories and am greatly delighted for you to know that I am a dyed-in-the-wool Englishman . " In appearance Mozart was decidedly unprepossessing . He was sometimes identified as " the funny little man with the light hair . " He was not more than five feet four inches tall , of slight build and habitually pale . His face had been lightly marked by smallpox . He had a mane of fine fair hair , of which he was proud , a heavy upper lip , and a large fleshy nose with pronounced nostrils . Altogether , he was not handsome . Contemporaries report that when he was playing the piano his expression changed , becoming more serene . His eyes settled into a steady calm gaze , and his muscles conveyed the sentiment expressed by his music . He styled his hair to obscure a strange malformation of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ) , he grew stout and developed a double chin . He showed a tendency to frequent bad company , from which Constanze sought to isolate him . He was restless and given to nervous fiddling with his watch chain or his hat . Music was always on his mind . He composed at meals , while playing billiards , while talking to friends . Usually he did n't even bother to test his ideas on the piano . His wife said : " He wrote down music in the same way as he wrote letters . " He composed the entire overture to I ) on Giovanni on paper the night before its opening performance , so that the orchestra had no chance to rehearse it . One endearing aspect of Mozart 's personality was his love of pets . He had a particular fox terrier bitch named Bimperl , whom he adored . At various times he boasted a pet grasshopper and several canaries . But his best known pet was a starling for which he paid thirty-four kreuzer , a paltry sum , entered in his account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his piano concertos . When it died in its cage , Wolfgang buried it in the garden and composed an elegy for it : A little fool lies here Whom I hold dear ?  | A starling in the prime Of his brief time , Whose doom it was to drain Death 's bitter pain . Thinking of this , my heart Is riven apart . He also owned a horse during his latter years and , on his doctor 's recommendation , took a ride every morning . The only other regular exercise he knew was a " favorite walk " every day . At the age of eleven he had been taught to fence , and it is known that he enjoyed dancing . He adored bowling and playing billiards , and had his own table . Occasionally he smoked a pipe . He enjoyed playing cards ( especially piquet ) and airing Bimperl . But the family diversion was target-shooting using air guns firing darts , a regular Sunday afternoon activity enjoyed with friends . He ate with good appetite , and his favorite dish was liver dumplings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " che gusto " ) and , another time , " a delicious slice of sturgeon . " He liked to drink wine , beer , and punch . He was not a voracious reader ( although he knew the works of Beaumarchais ) , and had little interest in contemporary affairs , paying no heed to the French Revolution . His moods were unpredictable . Karoline Pichler , a Viennese author of historical novels , recalled : Once I was sitting at the piano , playing Non pia andrai ' from Figaro ; Mozart , who happened to be present , came behind me , and my playing must have pleased him , for he hummed the melody with me , and beat time on my shoulders ; suddenly , however , he pulled up a chair , sat down , told me to keep playing the bass and began to improvise variations so beautifully that everyone present held his breath , listening to the music of the German Orpheus . But all at once he had enough ; he jumped up and , as he often did in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , miaowing like a cat , and turning somersaults like an unruly boy . . . . He lived in Vienna during his final years , but he was not as enthusiastic as he might have been because the Viennese and their court paid insufficient respect to his talent .  | Wolfgang had an ill-concealed distaste for France . He and Nannerl were introduced to Paris as children , but did not enjoy the visit , although the Bavarian author and diplomat Grimm had pronounced them " true prodigies " and did all he could to help their father arrange concerts . When Wolfgang returned to the French capital aged twenty-two , he complained : " Paris is greatly changed ; the French are not nearly as polite as they were fifteen years ago . Their manners now border on rudeness and they are detestably self-conceited . " After he gave twenty-four long lessons in musical composition to the daughter of the Duc de Guines , he was dismissed with a payment of three Louis d'or , which he refused . In 1778 , on a subsequent Parisian trip , Wolfgang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duchesse de Chabot : M. Grimm gave me a letter for her , so I drove there . . . . I kept my word and went . I had to wait for half an hour in a large ice-cold , unheated room , which had n't even a fireplace . At last the Duchesse de Chabot appeared . She was very polite and asked me to make the best of the clavier in the room , as none of her own were in good condition . Would I perhaps try it ? I said that I should be delighted to play something , but that it was impossible at the moment , as my fingers were numb with cold ; and I asked her to have me taken at least to a room where there was a fire . " Oh oui , Monsieur , vous avez raison , " was all the reply I got . She then sat down and began to draw . . . . I kept on thinking : " If it were not for M. Grimm , I would leave this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story short , I played on that miserable , wretched pianoforte . But what vexed me most of all was that Madame and all her gentlemen never interrupted their drawing for a moment , but went on intently , so that I had to play to the chairs , tables and walls . Wolfgang was born a Catholic and remained one all his life , but there is no evidence that he was especially religious . His feelings toward his church seem to have been cool but conventional until he became a Freemason . After 1782 he never went to church except to attend performances of his own liturgical works . Even on his Italian journeys he expressed somewhat critical views of the priesthood . He thought of his Masonic brethren not as antireligious but as acceptable to all faiths . However , the priest who had been summoned to his deathbed stayed away because he considered Wolfgang an apostate .  | Mozart was born with more natural talent , I venture to say , than any other artist in history . Many musicians would challenge this statement and claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal as a prodigy . I can only say that , from personal taste , I immensely prefer Mozart , both boy and man . One might claim that the infant painter Giotto matched his brilliance in another art . Such assertions are meaningless , but I venture the personal opinion that this is difficult to prove . To my own taste , Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach are the most superb composers ; and Mozart started out ahead early . His own instrumental gift was striking in its versatility . He played all string instruments . He was a splendid virtuoso on the piano and the clavier , especially before an appreciative audience , a factor that was of particular importance to his sensitive soul . He played and composed for a variety of instruments even including the glass harmonica invented by Benjamin Franklin out of drinking glasses filled with varying amounts of water .

The two men collaborated in three astounding successes : The Marriage of Figaro , Don Giovanni , and Cosi Fan Tutte . Wolfgang loved his Magic Flute ( libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder ) as much as he was pleased by Figaro . Until his end , Mozart , was composing dance music , concertos , Singspiel , serious opera , and sacred music . All told , he produced 626 compositions . After his death , the cities in which he had dwelled raced to capitalize on his former presence . Vienna , which he had disliked because it showed little appreciation for his talent , revived his works . He had detested his birthplace , Salzburg , which nevertheless erected a statue of him and holds an annual festival in his name . Mozart , who was scarcely without vanity , would have been deeply pleased to see how Brahms , Wagner , Berlioz , and Strauss acknowledged their debt to him in their music and also in their words . Haydn and Beethoven had been the first to acknowledge that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfgang was still living , the noble Haydn wrote to a Prague connoisseur : If I could impress upon the hearts of music lovers , especially the great ones , how inimitable are Mozart 's works , how profound ,  | how musically intelligent , how sensitive ( for this is how I understand and feel them ) , then nations would compete to possess such a jewel within their walls . Prague should hold onto the precious man ? and reward him , too . Without that , the fate of great geniuses is sad indeed , and gives posterity but little encouragement to strive further ; unfortunately , this is why so many promising talents succumb . I am angered that this unique man , Mozart , has still not been engaged at any royal or imperial court . Forgive me if I have gotten off the track ; I love the man too much . When his own English publisher expressed an interest in acquiring a collection of Mozart pieces , Haydn said : " Buy it by all means .

" It was also performed following Beethoven 's funeral in 1827 . Thus did one great musician take his leave of another . Soren Kierkegaard wanted to start a sect to revere Mozart . The theologian Karl Barth imagined that angels would play Mozart 's music before the Lord . Napoleon praised his opera Don Giovanni . In a poem , Keats wrote : " Rut many days have passed since last my heart was warm 'd luxuriously by divine Mozart . " And George Bernard Shaw , that famous music critic , wrote in 1893 : " It is as still true as it was before the Eroica Symphony existed that t here is nothing better in art than Mozart 's best .

The Churchill line in England has displayed since the seventeenth century , a continuous energetic strain that retains in it : blood stream a vast potential for genius : but only twice has this exploded into  | full blossom ; John Churchill , the great statesman-general , first duke of Marlborough and , in this century , that versatile Shakespearian genius Winston Spencer Churchill , who led his country to victory in its greatest war .

" The Kennedy dynasty , funded by the great and somewhat ill-gotten wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could boast one tragically short-lived chief of state of striking potential , one important cabinet member , and one senator with an eye long-fixed upon the White House . The two distantly related Roosevelt families each produced a great president whose descendants were political mediocrities . By far the most successful as well as the most honorable of families whose sons were elected to office or appointed to positions of public service generation after generation was and is the Adams family of Massachusetts , which could boast the exceptional distinction of forgoing compromise with honor and principle for the sake of advancement , yet continuing to succeed . The two greatest dynasts of the Adamses were , of course , John , the second U.S. president , and John Quincy Adams , the sixth president , both of whom were singularly intelligent , upright , honorable men who never courted honor but were awarded top distinction by their country . A superb account of this remarkable , talented , and patriotic dynasty has been compiled by the historian James Truslow Adams , himself not connected with " The Adams Family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells of the achievements of the entire Adams tribe from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries . This is not only acute , discerning , and well written , but so magnificently organized that the entire account is unraveled in less than four hundred pages . My own essay deals only with the two outstanding Adamses who became presidents . There is no true civilian equivalent to the Congressional Medal of Honor , top award for battlefield bravery which was granted to one father-son pair , Arthur and Douglas MacArthur . Had such a decoration existed , it would certainly have been more than merited by John Adams and his brilliant son , both fine men and great presidents : scrupulous , honest , and unafraid . There were other remarkable leaders in our early days whose names are so well known they need no mention ; but no such couple of dynasts . And the fact that ever since , generation after generation , their  | descendants continue to play leading parts in our society 's role of honor is a commemorable celebration from which the nation benefits ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many unusual aspects feature the origin of the American dynasts . They started as plain folk . When Henry Adams immigrated to Boston in 1636 with a wife and nine children , there was nothing notable about him . He was of undistinguished English stock and , by the colonial authorities , was granted land to establish a foothold near the Massachusetts town of Braintree . They settled in quietly , the most simple English of what were to become the great American families , and it is a curious comment that during three generations of diplomatic successes in disputes with England , this most English of U.S. clans carried the burden . As the greatest of them all , the pater familias , John Adams confided to his son : " If I were to go over my life again , I would be a shoemaker rather than an American statesman . " English as the Adamses were by antecedence and multiple political convictions , from the moment that the American colonies began to feel the burden of dependence and the impulse toward freedom , they moved with unhesitating sturdiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and with a lack of chauvinism ( a nineteenth-century concept ) , worked unyieldingly for total freedom . Oddly enough , the great diplomatic successes of earlier generations of Adams statesmen ? including two presidents , a secretary of state , and numerous diplomatic envoys were , as I have said , successes against the British . Yet the inherent honesty of the tribe 's character , handed on from generation to generation , never conceived or admitted any version of distorted emotionalism and maintained on both sides of all international arguments a determined , patient , forthright , if discreet , approach . The sculptured strength of the family , as it moved from four generations of obscurity in the tiny seventeenth-century village of Braintree to a leading position within the international eighteenth- and nineteenth-century world , was based on intellect and strong character . Neither John Adams nor John Quincy Adams proclaimed himself an ideologue . Theirs was not an era stuffed with definable " isms , " such as communism , socialism , fascism , naziism , etc . Theirs was a simplified time of monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incipient democracy , as already developed under the crown in England . Even in revolutions such as Britain 's ( seventeenth century ) and France 's ( eighteenth century ) and in the American war of independence , the upheavals generally began in opposition to a person , a group , or to a situation and only later developed their own more precise rationale . The American revolution- ary movement assumed a genuine ideological precision with the Continental Congress and the series of resolutions it passed , all of which led up to the U.S. constitution . It was as a constitutional lawyer and supporter of the struggle between all forms of individualism and corporate authority that the first notable Adams , John , initially made his mark . But neither he nor his eldest son , John Quincy , proclaimed any textbook ideology except freedom in its broadest sense . Both lived and practiced their dogma rather than merely orating about it ; practiced it in years of honorable public service . But what they practiced was the purest , noblest form of true democracy . Not until the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John , of outstanding importance : author , statesman , and political leader . He graduated from Harvard , the local college , and became a conventional school teacher . He confessed in his own diaries to an immense desire to write , and then shifted from education to law as a profession . During the mid-eighteenth century ( as ever since ) , lawyers had risen in eminence , importance , and versatility in the social , business and political worlds . Even so , rather suddenly , the 17505 disclosed new paths to power , usefulness , and influence for members of the bar . And it was as a constitutional lawyer that John influenced the profoundly important events that turned the British colonies in North America , south of the present Canadian border , into an independent nation . It is really quite astonishing , if one looks back to 1756 when John gave up his job as a school teacher in order to study law , to see the comparative scale of importance between Boston , center of Adams 's activities , which was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its great opponent , which boasted a population of 1.5 million . But a moment of immense historical import was invisibly shaping up , and the modest novice attorney was well suited to his forthcoming career as revolutionary , diplomat , politician , and statesman . He was not remarkable looking . Today he would be judged short and stodgy in appearance . Nor did he evince any of the qualities of popular appeal that marked his second cousin , the flamboyant orator Sam Adams . He was often intense and outspoken , sometimes impetuous , but always thoughtful , patriotic , independent-minded , and unflinchingly courageous . His character was not without blemishes . He was modest enough in truth to note in his own diary that he was " puffy , vain , conceited . " Yet he was strangely given to quarrels with great contemporaries like Washington , Jefferson ,  | Franklin , and he unabashedly manifested petty streaks of envy and jealousy during his subsequent career . As a young man , despite the profound earnestness of his character , he considered himself a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vanished after he married , in 1764 , the illustrious , well-connected Abigail Smith , who was to become the most cultivated , strong-minded wife of any United States president , at least before Eleanor Roosevelt . In 1765 , the year after John and Abigail 's wedding , Britain 's parliament enacted the Stamp Act to tax the commercially developing colonies . This provoked mass violence , which , to the intense distaste of John Adams , was fanned by his kinsman Sam 's propaganda . John preferred the calm but more effective recourse to legal action . At the end of the critical year , he delivered a speech before the colony 's governor and council pronouncing the act invalid because Massachusetts , possessing no representative in London 's Parliament , had not assented to the decree . The next ten years were of vital importance . In 1 768 John Adams moved from Braintree to Boston itself . It was becoming increasingly manifest to this overseas " British subject " that a government without the power to levy taxes was no government , and there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to express their views . The only alternative to a lack of such representation was independence . He arrived at this conclusion with icy logic . In 1770 British troops were landed around Boston to tranquilize that restless area . Adams acknowledged the likelihood that this move would inevitably be bound to lead to a physical showdown . The popular resentment against legislation imposed without representation by the citizenry legislated against mounted steadily and perceptibly . John Adams became an intellectual leader of this ever more significant current of thought . On March 5 , 1770 , a fight , dubbed the " Boston Massacre , " broke out between a small crowd and a handful of British soldiers . Four of the former were killed . An English captain and seven other ranks were arrested and charged with murder . Adams and Josiah Quincy accepted the unpopular task of defending the redcoats , recognizing this as their duty . The captain was acquitted together with the majority of soldiers . Two of the latter were found guilty of manslaughter , branded in the hand , and then released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inherent good judgment of the Bostonians that , despite the inflamed state of opinion , his upright conduct was approved by a heavy majority vote electing him to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . That body named him and Sam  | Adams as part of its delegation to a Continental Congress in Philadelphia from all the American colonies of Britain . He remained a member of that body , the country 's protonational administration , from 1774 until late 1777 . In June 1775 , consciously working toward unity and independence from London , he delivered a eulogy on George Washington and seconded Washington 's nomination as a commander in chief of the army of independence . With the Virginian 's unanimous election , North and South were de facto cemented together in a common cause . The idea of liberty was starting to advance . On June 7 , 1776 , Adams seconded Richard Henry Lee 's sonorous resolution that " these colonies are , and of a right ought to be , free and independent states . " The next day he was named together with Jefferson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate a Declaration of Independence . This was principally drafted by Jefferson , who wrote it , and Adams who played an outstanding part in the debate over its adoption . The legislative role of John Adams was primordial . In a debate on foreign affairs he cautioned : " We should separate ourselves as much as possible and as long as possible from all European politics and wars . " He dominated the committee assigned to establish an American navy , and he is even today considered its real father . Adams had by then earned a position of a sort extraordinarily rare in American politics . He was regarded as an honorable , fearless , trusted leader despite personal prejudices that he took no care to hide . By far the worst of these was an undisguised jealousy of the prestige and position of Washington as the revolutionary nation 's number one citizen , a prestige based upon the general 's own great reputation and also upon , to a large degree , Adams 's own recognition of this fact and his insistence upon its cardinal importance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truslow Adams was to write so much later , " the greatest blot upon his own career . " The biographer-historian described this unpleasant trait of John Adams , the statesman , as " compacted part of envy and part of disdain , " the kind of warped relationship that " the thinker has for the man of action and the intellectual for the practical . " It is sad , for those who would romanticize or sentimentalize their own past history , but it became widely known that Adams belonged to the anti-Washington faction , in some respects despising the father of his country , whose reputation he himself had done so much to manufacture and often to acclaim . In 1778 Congress recalled Silas Deane from his diplomatic mission to France and named Adams instead . This was not an assignment coveted by Adams who was well aware that the three colonial commissioners in Paris ? p 155 Deane , Benjamin Franklin , and Arthur Lee ? had been quarreling , and that he was simply being substituted for one of the disputing parties . Nevertheless , Adams dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his ten-year-old son , John Quincy . After his arrival , Adams soon made plain again this peculiar streak of envy he seemed to cherish for outstanding associates , in this case the sly , demure , intelligent , lively philosopher Franklin , who had made a great name both for himself and his cause at the court of King Louis XVI , above all with the principal minister , the Comte de Vergennes . He confided to his other associate , Lee , that while Franklin might be " a great satirist and a great politician , " it was dubious that he was " a great philosopher , a great moralist and a great statesman . " Indeed , it is always possible that Adams 's personal view was more correct than that which was then and subsequently maintained in Paris . Yet there is no doubt it discloses a nasty twist in the honorable Adams character . In 1779 Adams returned to Boston after Franklin was appointed sole American agent . With wearily cynical humor , the latter had suggested the former should remain in Paris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have irked the prim Bostonian . But Congress soon realized it would be useful to have in France its own man solely bearing authority to negotiate with England treaties of peace and of commerce , when such agreements became possible . Adams was selected for the job and , on September 27 , 1779 , named as minister plenipotentiary for this single purpose . The time , however , was not yet ripe . London did not consider conditions appropriate , and Paris suspected Adams correctly of not being maneuverable and also of being overly suspicious of Vergennes . The result of the consequent stalemate was that the young American government was induced to appoint Franklin , Jefferson , John Jay , and Henry Laurens to cooperate with Adams . Jefferson never participated and Laurens played a minimal role . Adams did not like the French , whose finesse had so successfully won over Franklin ( and vice versa ) , and he resented the effort of Vergennes to gain information concerning his own secret instructions from the Congress in Philadelphia . He himself was determined to take a line on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was too clever to hint this to Paris . I however , his venomous dislike for the British forced restraint on his mistrust of the French . And , after all , Franklin was the accredited American minister to Louis XVI 's government ; Adams 's assignment was simply to open negotiations with England when that became possible .  | Despite this restricted position , Adams undiplomatically wrote a long letter directly to Vergennes urging much greater French naval aid to the Americans and also demanding that the French minister should endorse his own mission to the British . Vergennes , accustomed to dealing with Franklin , answered negatively and with evident contempt . At this point , Adams made an unpardonable mistake . He did everything within his power ? unsuccessfully ? to , in effect , supplant Franklin as minister to France because he felt the amiable philosopher was doing his job incompetently . All he managed by this awkward and inexcusable maneuver was to further anger Vergennes and to start a needless and unhappy personal quarrel with Franklin . Adams was never a smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt his worst mistake . Curiously enough , Congress chose that moment to assign two additional negotiating tasks to Adams : one as minister to Holland , and the other to arrange for a series of loans . He was entirely successful in gaining Dutch recognition of American independence and also brought about a much needed set of financial borrowings . In 1785 his diplomatic career was crowned by formal appointment as the first United States minister to the British Court of St. James 's , after heading the brilliant American team that negotiated the victorious peace treaty of Paris ending the War of Independence . His diplomatic task in London was testing and a personal trial . The British were scarcely cordial to a rebel ? above all one who had succeeded ? and Adams found none of the friendly cooperation he had occasionally imagined possible between the two ex-enemies . His wife , Abigail , acutely resented the cold treatment they received . When he first presented his credentials , in 1785 , to King George III , the most personalized enemy of Americans until the German Kaiser Wilhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew Adams had little confidence in France 's government . Adams acknowledged this was true but then bluntly added : " I must avow to Your Majesty that I have no attachment but to my own country . " The sovereign was certainly unaccustomed to such outspoken frankness from diplomats presenting their letters of credence . While in London he published a book many Americans wrongly claimed favored wealth and aristocracy ; this harmed him . In 1788 he resigned and sailed for home . He had been the first of three successive generations of Adamses who acted as minister to England during moments of exceptional strain between the two peoples , a bitter joke by fate at the expense of this " most English " of American families . At the end of the year the new republic of the United States of America  | elected its first president , who was sworn in early in 1789 . The then Republican Party ( in modern terms , equivalent to today 's Democrats ) nominated Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr for the number one and number two positions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , the man with the second-largest vote among all those listed automatically became vice president , making it quite easy to have a chief executive of one party assisted by an emergency replacement from the other . Everyone assumed that George Washington , whose strong character and honorable personality had led the ragged revolutionary forces to victory , would be chosen to head the state . So the vote was really for a vice president . The Federalist Party nominated Adams , ignoring Washington 's brilliant young aide , Alexander Hamilton , and the suavely eminent John Jay . Both were considered too unpopular among the voting public , the first because of his taut financial policy , the second because of a disliked treaty he had negotiated with England . But Hamilton remained the strongest political figure in the Federalist Party , a maker of presidents if not a potential president himself . And unfortunately for Adams , he and Hamilton were outright enemies , a fact that affected their own careers as well as the course of the nation . There was little doubt that Adams , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , was entitled to lead the Federalists , however much Hamilton detested him . He knew Adams was not malleable and wished personally to remain the power behind the party throne . After the electoral votes were counted , it was found that Washington had received all sixty-nine , becoming the new nation 's first chief of state , but none of the other nominees had received a majority for the second position ; Adams , leading all other contenders with thirty-four , thus became vice president . Hamilton 's vindictive interference had produced this unsatisfactory minority solution . However , Adams ( who respected Washington as a commanding general but not as a political leader ) dutifully carried out his two terms as vice president through 1796 , exerting a more powerful influence on Senate votes , as presiding officer , than any of his successors in that office . It became known in 1796 that Washington would not under any conditions agree to stand for a third term . The Federalists therefore again nominated Adams , along with General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , and the Republicans proposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seventy-one to sixty-eight , thus producing a Federalist president and a Republican vice president . The young U.S. government had not yet developed many of its current  | traditions , and the custom of completely changing official advisers when a new president was installed did not apply . Adams therefore retained Washington 's entire cabinet . This meant that some of its leading members believed their prior loyalty was owed to Hamilton , their party boss , and not to President Adams . That unfortunate fact exacerbated the sore already existing between the two Federalists , impinging upon the dignity and judgment of both . Hamilton sought to apply executive rule behind the scenes as party chief and to diminish the real power of the president . Almost from the moment of the national government 's creation and until the end of the Napoleonic wars , including America 's own second conflict with Britain , the War of 1812 , U.S. foreign and domestic politics were dominated by relationships with England and France . The Federalists , who favored strong government , became increasingly friendly to the British monarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they understood it intellectually , were pro-France . In this difficult situation , Adams showed himself commendably impartial . He sympathized with neither of the two great powers but saw correctly that there was no benefit to the United States in tolerating the insults of one more than the other . This was the situation vis-a-vis France , which had just refused to accept General Pinckney as American envoy and which had instituted even more repressive decrees with regard to U.S. commerce than the common enemy , England . Talleyrand , architect of French policy , in addition refused to receive any American mission unless sizable bribes were first paid to individual French officials and America increased a promised loan to Paris . When some members of Congress learned of the bribe proposal , Adams allowed publication of official reports on the matter , substituting the initials X , Y , and Z for the names of the key French agents involved , resulting in the documents henceforth being known as the " X.Y.Z . " letters . They caused a scandalous uproar in the United States . The Federalist Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hamilton , who thought he could use the occasion to conquer the southwest " Louisiana Territory . " This was a huge tract , held at that time by France and previously by Spain . Adams was determined to avoid such a conflict if this could be done with honor . Talleyrand sent word via Holland that Paris would accept a minister to negotiate terms for ending differences between the two countries . The Federalist president accepted this gesture , to the anger of the Hamilton Jingo faction , and extended the olive branch of peace .  | In 1800 Hamilton published an excoriating attack on Adams as unfit " for the station of Chief Magistrate , " but wound up his criticisms in a peculiar way by announcing he would vote for his reelection anyway . The Adams cause was badly damaged with predictable results . At last , the Republican , Thomas Jefferson , was elected president , primarily because the leader of Adams 's own party had pronounced him not competent to lead the nation . The long career in public service of the versatile , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final act before retirement was singularly important : he appointed John Marshall as chief justice of the Supreme Court . Adams had thus played a vital role in preparing the Declaration of Independence , in helping to secure George Washington 's position as military commander , in assisting the formulation of the new country 's foreign policy , in creating its navy , in setting out the lines for avoidance of entanglements in European wars ( soon to be temporarily put aside under a successor , James Madison , when the 1812 conflict erupted ) , and in naming the great jurist Marshall , who established the basis of fundamental American law . The seat of government was shifted from Philadelphia to the newly built town of Washington at the very end of his term . On November 1 , 1800 , Adams became the first tenant of the White House . But very soon thereafter , he rode out of the capital and thus refused to meet the successor he detested , the handsome , red-haired Tom Jefferson . Following years of public service and diplomatic travel abroad , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adams summed up his career accordingly : " In every considerable transaction of my public life I have invariably acted according to my best judgment , and I can look up to God for the sincerity of my intentions . " Even Jefferson , his old rival and political opponent , called him " Disinterested as the Being who made him . " The only truly negative action of Adams 's administration was the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts , which brought discredit to the Federalists and widened the gulf in that party between Adams and Hamilton . This factor combined with Jefferson 's personal popularity to put an end to Adams 's long and varied career . The ex-president preferred the rural life of Quincy , where he was not well liked , to the growing town of Boston . He felt hurt and resentful because of his enforced retirement from public life amid unflattering comparisons with ( korge Washington , his predecessor . And the blemish in his character , which had so long indicated envy of and resentment for the first president , was inflamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own son George Washington Adams . The poor grandson ended up by committing suicide .  | In 1812 the second president admitted that the eleven years he had already spent in Quincy surrounded by children and grandchildren had been most comfortable and he had " never enjoyed so much any equal period . " Moreover , he began that very year , which saw the outbreak of another conflict with England , by writing a letter to President Jefferson renewing their erstwhile but long-lapsed friendship . These resumed cordial relations must have brought much satisfaction to the two old leaders who , by extraordinary coincidence , died the same day , July 4 , 1826 , fiftieth anniversary of their Declaration of Independence . Adams 's last recorded words were : " Thomas Jefferson survives . " However , with amazing simultaneity , Jefferson died at almost that precise moment . The two remaining signers of the Declaration vanished together . As James Truslow Adams wrote of America 's leading family : There has always been in the Adamses a strong tendency toward dramatizing themselves and making themselves imaginatively play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In indulging in this they exaggerate the elements in every such situation , intensifying in their own minds the odds against which they have had to struggle . A competitor is not merely a competitor ; he is a malignant enemy , come from the Devil to destroy the noblest work of God . Circumstances that may oppose their plans are not accidents ; they are damnable efforts on the part of society to thwart an Adams . It is not pleasant to dwell upon this aspect of the family mentality , but it is necessary to understand it , for it has been as continuous a trait as has the great intellectual ability displayed by every generation beginning with John , and in its way , of almost as great an influence upon the family 's history . It is a trait that is characteristic of the early New England divines , who felt that any opposition to their own ideas or wishes were assaults of the Devil upon the Kingdom of God . This is an astute observation and makes for interesting speculation upon the longevity in some families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed on occasion in the life of John Quincy Adams , just as it marred his father 's career from time to time , both in personal and political relationships . John Quincy was born July ii , 1767 , a few months before the family moved to Boston and settled in Brattle Square in what became locally known as the " White House . " Clearly thanks to his . mother 's well-honed features , he  | was a far better-looking boy than his father , and physical distinction became as much a family trait as intellectual ability . In 1778 he accompanied John on the latter 's first mission to Paris and like his father kept a detailed record of his experiences , although he was only ten years old when he began this diary . With remarkable maturity , he described how their frigate captured one British ship and was chased by another . In 1797 John Quincy married Louisa Johnson , daughter of an American father and English mother , who had been brought up in France and was much admired for her beauty . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal . He accepted the post with some embarrassment because his father had already won the 1796 election and was president-elect of the United States . But his assignment was changed to that of the more important post of minister to Prussia after Washington , in his last presidential days , wrote the incoming second chief of state to voice a " strong hope that you will not withhold merited promotion from Mr. John Quincy Adams because he is ? our son . . . . I give it as my decided opinion that Mr. Adams is the most valuable public character we have abroad , and that there remains no doubt in my mind that he will prove himself to be the ablest of all our diplomatic corps . " On the basis of Washington 's admiring opinion , President Adams wrote his son that he should feel no lack of impropriety in accepting the mission . There is no doubt that John Quincy already had much experience and a distinguished record . He studied in Holland after his first arrival in Europe and then , in 1781 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he remained for a year as secretary to the American minister , Francis Dana . As a brilliant boy , he was already starting to develop an austere , cool , diffident manner . I le already spoke French and Dutch and , while in St. Petersburg , studied German , Latin , and Greek . After his tour in Russia , he returned to the Dutch city of Leyden to resume his studies there , stopping in Stockholm en route and announcing after six weeks there that he liked Sweden better than any European country he had visited . In 1785 , remarkably educated and widely traveled , he was offered the post of secretary to his father , whom he had served in Paris and who was by then the first American minister to London . Instead , the youngster made up his mind to return alone to the United States , graduate from I larvard , and then prepare himself for the bar . He wrote in his journal : " I had rather continue some time longer in obscurity and make some provision for fortune before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' l'his sage and prudent decision showed that John Quincy was  | already aware of the need for him to pursue a personal policy free from the influence of any party of special faction . On his twenty-seventh birthday he was named as American minister resident at the Hague , journeying via London to carry confidential dispatches to John Jay , by then minister to Britain . In Holland once again , this time on a significant diplomatic mission , he studied Italian and read continually in four languages . Three years later he married his charming bride , whom he took on to Berlin with him when he was ultimately sent to Prussia . However , he became increasingly eager to return to America , homesick , eager to strike out on a new career , removed from diplomacy , and embarrassed by the fact that he had been appointed to Berlin by his father who would be succeeded in the White House by Jefferson , at that time regarded with extreme dislike by the Adamses , especially by the loyal and devoted Abigail . In 1803 the thirty-six-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was soon to prove himself perhaps the most intelligent of all the Adamses . In Washington , where his social , intellectual , and worldly gifts were less appreciated than in other cities , he was soon made aware of the considerable enmity for his father , which persisted , and the deep , bitter factionalism within the Federalist party . It was quipped that " the Republicans under Jefferson trampled upon the Federalists and the Federalists trampled upon John Quincy Adams . " Thus caught up in political quarrels not of his own making , John Quincy added to the unpopularity he had inherited from his father by displaying an unconciliatory rigidity in personal relationships and a blatant political independence , stressing his refusal to sacrifice his concepts of integrity to party interests . At the end of his first senatorial year he wrote : " The country is so totally given up to the spirit of the party that not to follow blindfold the one or the other Federalist or Republican is an inexpiable offence . " The Massachusetts senator 's position became more and more balanced between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions supporting Jefferson 's Non-Importation Act of i 8o6 , defending the rights and honor of America , this view made his breach with the New England Federalists open and incapable of being healed . In 1807 , when he again backed Jefferson 's policy , Federalist anger with him became unlimited . The Federalist legislature of his home state opposed the president 's trade embargo and improperly elected a senatorial successor to John Quincy Adams nine months before his legal term had ended . I Ie resigned . He wrote : " On most of the great national questions now under  | discussion , my sense of duty leads me to support the anti-Federalist administration and I find myself of course in opposition to the Federalists in general . . . . As my term of service nears its close , I am constantly approaching to the certainty of being restored to the situation of a private citizen . " Both by his actions and by the notations he entered in his diary , we know that John Quincy was ambitious to hold high office . However , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position . When Madison was elected president , he offered John Quincy the post of minister to Russia and Adams accepted . But the Senate , dominated by his enemies , voted that such a mission was not required . Later in the year , Madison repeated the offer , and this time the Senate changed its mind , confirming Adams in the post . The former senator was a highly cultivated man of the world , and he made no secret of his attraction for Europe . However , he regretted having to leave behind his elderly parents and the two of his children still remaining at school in Boston . But with a return to diplomacy , he felt he could indulge his craving for culture , what he personally described as " an eager relish for the pursuits of literature and . . . a taste for the fine arts . " Both John Quincy and his wife spoke excellent French , even today a rare American achievement . French was the lingua franca of the Russian court and society . The American minister was thus easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently at both official and social occasions . Alexander , who was engaged in war with Napoleonic France , offered to mediate the conflict that had broken out between America and England ( the War of 1812 ) , but London spurned the offer . Subsequently , Britain expressed willingness for direct negotiations , and the United States delegated John Quincy and three commissioners to seek a treaty of peace . This was agreed upon in the lowlands city of Ghent in a negotiation of which the Marquess of Wellesley later Duke of Wellington said in the House of Lords that it demonstrated the Americans displayed " a most astonishing superiority over the British . " Adams left Ghent for Paris in January 1815 in the wake of peace . It had been thirty years since he was last in the City of Light , and he settled down with his wife to enjoy himself . He was treated with respect and friendship , and Washington 's old friend Lafayette even came to the capital from his country home to see him . However , very soon John Quincy was appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , renting as headquarters a distant house ? eight miles from I lyde Park corner ? to save money . In 1817  | he returned to Washington when President James Monroe named him secretary of state . The main problem inherited by the great new secretary was the question of Florida . This was combined with the definition of Louisiana 's western boundary and Spain 's patent inability to put down freebooters from Amelia Island and Galveston . These complex matters were intermixed with the United States ' effort to adhere to a neutral position in the various wars between Spain and her Latin American colonies , actions that stimulated threats by other European nations to intervene . The tense situation worsened when General Andrew Jackson marched into Spanish Florida , seized it , captured two Englishmen in the process , and executed them for instigating Indian hostilities . Thus , Washington for a time seemed on the verge of simultaneous wars with Madrid and London . Fortunately , the policy of Britain 's foreign secretary , Lord Castlereagh , basically sought friendship with America and conflict was avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for openly disavowing Jackson . Finally , on February 22 , 1819 , the secretary of state signed a treaty with the Spanish minister to Washington ceding Florida to the U.S. and arranging a precise western boundary for Louisiana . This steady , unemotional diplomacy achieved by Adams alone was a significant personal triumph . During Monroe 's second term in the White House , the greatest success of the secretary of state was his formulation of what came to be known as the Monroe Doctrine ? for the president , rather than the Adams Doctrine , after the man who envisioned it ? and its requirement as a touchstone for American foreign policy . The purpose of the doctrine was to warn off European nations seeking to establish or expand lodgments in the western hemisphere . There had already been difficulties with Russia over North America 's Pacific coast . Adams called in Tuyl , the Czar 's minister , and warned that the United States " would contest the right of Russia to any territorial establishment on the American continent , and . . . would distinctly assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new European colonial establishments . " He won Monroe over to this line , and the president 's message in 1823 declared that Washington would oppose colonization in this hemisphere and regard " any attempt on their the Europeans part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere " as dangerous to U.S. safety and to peace . The doctrine has hitherto had a profound impact upon American diplomacy and strategy , although its validity is being brought increasingly into doubt .  | So impressive had his record as number one cabinet member been that there was much reason to anticipate Adams would succeed Monroe as chief of state when the latter 's second term ended in 1824 . However , the jealousy of political rivals and the vindictiveness of personal enemies spawned a succession of virulent , often scurrilous attacks on his appearance , his honor , and his pride . John Quincy wrote ruefully but philosophically in his diary : To suffer without feeling is not in human nature ; and when I consider that to me alone , of all the candidates before the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of censure by the nation upon my past service , I can not dissemble to myself that I have more at stake upon the result than any other individual in the Union . Yet a man qualified for the elective Chief Magistracy of ten millions of people should be a man proof alike to prosperous and adverse fortune . The results of electoral vote-counting were delayed , although Andrew Jackson clearly had more votes than Adams . Jackson supporters planted a fake news story in the press saying that Henry Clay , whose backing was crucial , would throw his influence behind any candidate who would agree to make him secretary of state . Clay was the obvious candidate for that post in any case . The electoral contest was settled by the House of Representatives . Adams was elected . Clay was soon named to the State Department , and roars of a slanderous nature were heard throughout the country from Jacksonians . Adams remained aloof . He did nothing to help his own cause or reputation . He simply wrote an immediate report to his aged , tottering father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter of the 9th . Never did I feel so much solemnity as upon this occasion . The multitude of my thoughts , and the intensity of my feelings are too much for a mind like mine , in its ninetieth year . May the blessing of God Almighty continue to protect you to the end of your life , as it has hitherto protected you in so remarkable a manner from your cradle . On the date of his inauguration , March 4 , 1825 , John Quincy wrote in his journal : " After two successive sleepless nights , I entered upon this day with a supplication to I leaven , first , for my country ; secondly , for myself  | and for those connected with my good name and fortunes , that the last results of its events may be auspicious and blessed . " It was immediately obvious that the headstrong and popular Jackson would be a strong candidate in the 1828 elections , and he began his fight for the presidency as soon as Adams entered the White House . The old political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became clear that in this competitive flux the ultimate fate of John Quincy 's administration would be negative . Adams would promise nothing as a reward for political support . The Jacksonians promised the moon . Adams proclaimed in his inaugural address : While foreign nations , less blessed with that freedom which is power than ourselves , are advancing with gigantic strides in the career of public improvement , are we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arms and proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our constituents ? . . . Moral , political , and intellectual improvement are duties assigned by the Author of our Existence to social , no less than to individual man . Herein is the kernel of American democratic ideology . Despite the lavish Jacksonian offers of widespread patronage if their champion defeated Adams , the latter removed only twelve office-holders in four years ? each with just reason . He was subjected to endless libelous attacks . Even his vice president , John C. Calhoun , opposed him by refusing , as presiding officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of order . It soon became apparent that , together with his own father , Washington 's successor , John Quincy Adams would be the only other single-term chief of state of the first six elected . One might call this an indifference to political skill or , more justly , a testimonial to the moral honor and independence of the only father-son team to lead our country . The 1828 election was dirty and partisan on both sides ; and Jackson won easily . Primitive populist democracy reigned . The Jackson Administration contained many members , starting with the president himself , who at one or another time had been indebted to Adams for his services or help . But now , with the exception of Martin Van Buren , none even paid the departing leader the customary ceremonial visit . Adams noted : " After fourteen years of incessant and unremitted employment I have passed to a life of total leisure , and from living in a constant crowd to a life of almost total solitude. "  | Rather to his and the national astonishment , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as candidate for the House of Representatives . He agreed but said he would not solicit votes . Nevertheless , he won a smashing victory and courageously returned to Washington , where for so long he had been a national and international star , to serve as a plain Congressman , beginning again " like a boy , " as Clay said sympathetically . This modest step symbolized his commitment to the three interdependent legs upon which the tripod of American democracy rested . As a humble Congressman , Adams continued to try to improve the condition of his countrymen through the development of natural resources , a policy he had insisted upon while president . He also sought to minimize political patronage and encourage able , honest men to seek careers in the civil service . Unfortunately , the new mood of cynical , self-seeking ambition that Jackson had discerned and successfully employed in rising to power , prevailed in the nation and its legislature . Nevertheless , the congressman from Quincy maintained his courage and his dream of moral integrity , stimulated in addition by the crisis over slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . As a fierce old champion of the good , he made more enemies but also earned widespread admiration . He fought stubbornly against the " gag " rule enacted by a heavy majority in the House , which sought to limit debates on the slave issue . In a dramatic speech , he opposed seizure of Texas and thereafter noted that prevention of slavery 's extension " is a cause upon which I am entering at the last stage of life , and with the certainty that I can not advance in it far ; my career must close , leaving the cause at its threshold . " Despite the increasing weight of age , Adams took heart in the constancy of his Massachusetts supporters and persisted in attacks on the unconstitutional " gag . " Finally , when he was almost eighty , the House rescinded the closure restriction in December 1845 . That day his diary terminated : " Blessed , forever blessed , be the name of God . " The following year he had a stroke . Notwithstanding , after a partial recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor the venerable patriot , who had by that time opposed almost every member on one or another occasion . Adams was never strong enough to speak again in the chamber . On February 21 , 1848 , he attempted suddenly to rise from his seat but toppled forward in a coma . The final words he was able to utter were : " Thank the officers of the House . This is the last of earth ! I am content ! " Once again the nation , although its psychological and political moods  | had greatly altered , witnessed the greatness of an indomitable Adams . The father , John , is generally held to be the outstanding member of this distinguished clan . Which of the two was the better president is hard to say . Neither could be termed popular ; both were indomitable . John was on the whole better suited to the popular mood of his period at the helm . Be that as it may ? there can be no doubt of the total absence of pliancy in John Quincy 's presidential record ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public servant has surpassed that of the younger Adams . He was exceedingly cultivated , well read , educated to an unusual degree , far traveled , discreet , careful , a splendid diplomat despite his tendency toward rigidity , a fine negotiator , and a remarkable linguist . It is almost unquestionable that he was the best secretary of state the United States ever had . He was also an uncompromising political champion of the antislavery cause in Congress . His outstanding role in conceiving the Monroe Doctrine , stimulated by his then unique perception of a Russian threat to North America , is probably more acutely pertinent today than at any time since 1823 . Certain marked traits were obvious defects in the unusually noble characters shared by the only father and son to gain the White House . Neither courted popularity ; each accepted office but did n't seek it . Both were subject to the jealousy of their rivals and vindictiveness toward many who disgreed with them . Both were unusually intelligent , simultaneously ambitious and modest , and thought more of serving their country than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these characteristics , marking both men , were inherited by the son from the father or were acquired in boyhood by John Quincy from the example of John . John perhaps achieved more in his life because of the vital and critical situation in which he found himself as revolution burst into flame around him . John Quincy , a remarkable diplomat and statesman perhaps more brilliant and surely more cultivated than his learned father , was even more endowed with enemies . Yet he had vast influence and , like his father , always thought first of his nation , then himself . Neither father nor son was popular . Both were indomitable ? and great ; the most splendidly democratic congeners America has yet produced .  | A Family Enterprise . ' Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi Motilal Nehru , father of India 's first prime minister and grandfather of India 's first woman prime minister , was an interesting , dominating , selfwilled man . He came of Kashmiri Brahmin descent , perhaps the highest layer of the highest caste in India 's complicated class society , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate . But it is a difficult task to alter a complex ancient set of intricate social and religious distinctions . The only successful effort in this respect has been that of Islam . When India 's Moslem conquerors produced the great Moghul Empire , imposing their concepts upon the sub-continent , they eliminated caste differences for all the millions they could convert . The multi-caste heritage stems from the multi-god concept of Hinduism , not the monotheistic concepts of Mohammed . I gathered from personal conversations with both that Motilal Nehru had less influence on his son than on his granddaughter . As one close friend of Motilal said of him and his famous son : " Motilal sat still and expected the world to come to him . Jawaharlal was always running about going to see people himself . " Like his descendents , Motilal was handsome . He was born a refugee from the 1857 Indian Mutiny ( against Britain ) . The stricken family had already fled from Delhi to Agra , seat of the magnificent Taj Mahal . There they were accepted by both Hindus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Islamic-sponsored Hindu Brahmin Pandits ( learned teachers ) . Mrs. ( sandhi , as Prime Minister , inferred to me in 1969 that she had been even more influenced by her grandfather than by her father : " He  | Motilal started with very little ; it was the kind of story you Americans like . Our family has had many ups and downs and also we have always had a very close-knit family system in which a young man may have to support everyone . " My grandfather started poor but he was a very good lawyer and became rich . He saw to it that even all his nephews were educated in Europe . And although we had a disciplined upbringing , he was fond of the good life . He got on very well with the British , but he was always keenly conscious of India 's situation and he fought hard for greater rights . " He joined the Congress party essentially the creation of Mohandas Gandhi early when it was a small middle-class party , and saw Gandhi make it into a mass movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Gandhi . He gave up everything and joined . " Motilal , as was traditional in India , was most ambitious for his son , Jawaharlal . He was determined to win the boy entrance to Harrow , the famous English public school which was attended by Winston Churchill . From there Jawaharlal went to Cambridge . Many of young Nehru 's most intimate friends in England were Moslems , including the brother of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan who , under the inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi , was to become known as the Frontier Gandhi and suffer long imprisonment in Pakistan . Analyzing himself later Jawaharlal saw this period of his life as nebulous : at Cambridge he had drifted on a vague desire to enjoy a pleasing life . He recalled that religion had no appeal for him , he disliked its repression . " I was superficial and did not go deep into anything . And so the aesthetic side of life appealed to me , and the idea of going through life worthily , not indulging it in a vulgar way but still making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted me . " At the same time " risk and adventure " fascinated him . Like his father he was a " bit of a gambler at first with money and then for higher stakes , with the bigger issues of life . " Nehru 's father knew through his own experience that there were various types of British , including the racist snobs and the honorable meritocracy and also that all people must be evaluated according to their merit . His thought was to live by this standard . From his youth Motilal had espoused the cause of Indian nationalism and rejected the taboos of old-fashioned Hinduism as they applied to Brahmins . He saw to it that caste restrictions and privileges were never observed in his own household . But he used the increasing profits of his own  | admired legal talents to comfort with luxuries the loneliness of his distant son in England . He also advised his boy to be sure to wield a cricket bat with skill if he wished to be admired by his English schoolmates . Motilal was , moreover , tolerant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept up by the scientific mysticism then becoming a notable international influence under the sponsorship of Mrs. Annie Besant . He announced to his father that he wished to become a member of her Theosophical Society . Motilal simply laughed , causing the boy to feel his father lacked " spirituality , " but he did not prevent him from carrying out his wish . It was not long before Jawaharlal , lacking the essential Hindu piousness , dropped theosophy while retaining a personal affection for Mrs. Besant . Much insight into the complex character of Nehru is given in an article by a certain " Chanakya " that appeared in 1937 published by a Calcutta review . Later Nehru acknowledged that he had written the piece himself for his own amusement and sent it to a lady friend . The latter passed it on to someone else , who published it . " Chanakya " was , in fact , the name of a counselor of the great Indian Emperior Chandragupta who had talked with Alexander the Great . The piece exposed many aspects both of Nehru the complicated introvert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that within him lay the makings of a dictator . A curious little vanity , that piece ; it exposed sentiments and egocentric traits more than policy ideas . But he pointed out to me that in a decade at the forefront of Indian politics these character weaknesses had not manifested themselves in actions . The best analysis I have heard of Nehru came from the most astute and possibly the least known United States ambassador to New Delhi , the career diplomat and brilliant public servant , Loy Henderson . Henderson was the first American envoy to the newly independent Indian republic after partition and British withdrawal . On April 22 , 1950 , I lunched with him and asked him for his personal summation , above all with respect to Nehru 's anti-American bias , which had already manifested itself . Henderson said : Nehru went down very well with the American people but not very well with the U.S. government during his trip to the New World . He was too vague and theoretical in his talks with Washington officials . He is a curious , vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a way of thinking out loud in a direct and honest planner which he can do to one person or to a large  | crowd and in either case with an astonishing effect of winning support . He also always had a direct mass appeal to the broad masses in India and deliberately cultivated the thinking aloud method which fascinates them . Nehru , however , has certain inner secrets . He is strongly anti-American . This stems from several things . His governess when he was a boy came from the British middle classes and regularly hammered into his head the concept that Americans were vulgar , second-rate people . This , as his sister has confided , had an effect . Whenever an American was invited to the house , the governess would alert the children and then comment on the visitor 's manners afterward in a critical way . Secondly , Nehru is by nature a tremendous introvert and automatically resents the normal extrovert manner of Americans . Furthermore , he tends to look down upon them as cheap and non-intellectual . Nehru has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a strong and perhaps subconscious reaction of pride . All this was reinforced in one way or another by his education at Harrow . Nehru is by conviction a Socialist . He used to be a Marxist but now tends more toward the British form ; Harold Laski had a very strong influence upon him . Nehru does not like the autocratic system of Russia but probably in his heart of hearts he is less anti-Russian than he is anti-American . He is a man of great knowledge and also one who enjoys life . He is more fond of the company of women than of men , probably because he was brought up by and with women . He had a tremendous friendship with Lady Mountbatten wife of the last British Viceroy , which may even have been more than that . Nehru himself admitted to me later that he was " a little timid where sex was concerned . " Henderson 's analysis continued : Nehru is passionately loyal to his friends . Although his wife was from Kashmir and his own ancestors came from there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a devoted personal friend of Sheikh Abdullah , whom he appointed prime minister of Kashmir . In personal conversations Nehru always criticizes the United  | States and never Russia , but privately he says that if India could not be neutral in another world war she would be on the side of Western democracy . Nehru opposes Communist tactics in India but he does not criticize communism in the broad sense , whereas he frequently criticizes the United States in public . He assails America for colonialism , racial discrimination and unequal distribution of resources . He says America has not yet recognized that European colonialism , no matter what its form , is only the domination of colored people by the West . Nehru is obviously a complex personality with great and petty qualities . Henderson had two other comments on the fascinating character of Nehru . The first was that Nehru was essentially a feminine personality . Secondly , Nehru was very vain . For example , he was bald and therefore almost always wore a hat . There seems little question that Nehru did have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked many Americans . In 1955 , Donald Kennedy , the U.S. charge d'affaires told me in Delhi that our collective embassy analysis was that Nehru 's undoubted prejudice stemmed from four sources : Racism ? a resentment of American attitudes about white " superiority " ; imperialism ? the white man stuck with his fellows , and we had supported the French in Indochina ; forthrightness ? Americans tended to be too blunt and outspoken ; and " uncouthness " ? Nehru 's feeling was that most Americans were simply " uncouth . " Our ways irritated him : private investment , advertising , pushiness . And the close advisers around Nehru shared this view and nourished his bias . Not that we ourselves were n't stupid about our expressed attitudes . At a dinner given for Nehru by a group of bankers , during his official visit to the United States in 1949 , the host boasted that so many billion dollars were represented by the people gathered about the table . Nehru shuddered . At a White House dinner he sat on President Truman 's right : Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken up in debate between Truman and Vinson on the relative merits of Maryland ( Vinson 's state ) and Missouri ( Truman 's state ) Bourbon whiskey . If Henderson 's analysis of the psychological influence of Nehru 's English governess on the children was sound ( and I 'm sure it was ) , one can c silt ' see that these irritant seeds fell on receptive soil . I had my first extensive wide-ranging talk with Pandit Nehru on April V6 , loco . IHe received me in his private residence in New Delhi , a large  | comfortable building which used to be the home of the commander-in-chief of the Indian Army during the British raj . We sat in a living room on the second floor in comfortable armchairs . Orange juice and cigarettes were served . I noted then : Nehru was wearing his usual jodhpurs and long coat of linen , but he did not have on his customary Congress cap . His bald head gives him a different appearance from when I saw him last at a reception with his cap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first meeting when he was irked about some dispatches I had written from Pakistan . He had a curious way of speaking . It is indecisive and indirect . You ask him a question and he begins to answer it by talking continually in his famous " thinking aloud " method ; but just when he seems to have reached the climax he stops . I started off by asking what he thought should be American policy in Asia and he replied with the following oblique answer : " Our general approach to all these problems is governed by certain idealistic factors . Essentially it is one of having enough troubles to face at home , without taking up burdens elsewhere . Also it is the realistic approach of not saying something you can not do . " By force of circumstances the United States has an economic responsibility to face . I can only tell you rather generally how we for our part try to act wherever possible . We think that generally speaking the problems of Asia can not be solved by military means . However , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Asia are in a state of acute mental change . They are more politically conscious because of the changeover from the period of colonial rule . Their first national reaction is to expect a betterment of their economic conditions . Primary problems of these undeveloped areas are things dealing with the essentials of life . Other matters are relatively theoretical . Another fundamental urge is what might be called the nationalist urge . This , after the colonial stage , is strong . Moreover , people incline toward any policy or proposition that tends to realize or improve their condition ? whether it does or not is  | another matter . I quote Nehru directly and as a result this sounds confused . " Where the nationalist urge and the economic urge join , that produces a powerful movement . Where they tend to split up , there is weakness . It should be our purpose , therefore , to help and encourage the nationalist urge , plus giving it the economic content of future betterment . " The strongest anti ' feeling in these countries is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colonial forms of control . These are the basic factors out of which we feel policy should grow . " Since Nehru had not answered my question on what American policy should be , I repeated it . He replied : " It means encouraging national elements as such and helping them in so far as possible toward economic advance . These elements are split up . If sufficient incentive is given to national feeling plus economic advance , that would attract many people . " I should imagine most intelligent people do n't regard the Untied States as a colonial power . But I suppose there are plenty of people who have rather vague and undefined suspicions , mainly because the United States is a very powerful country economically and in other ways . Take the relationship of England and India today ; there is not a ghost of a chance of their imposing any policy on us . I am not in the slightest degree afraid of such . But past suspicions remain " I asked him about Russia and he replied , " There has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , chiefly in central Asia , the Soviet Union was a liberalizing force that raised the tone . Partly that was because of the frightfully backward conditions prevailing which gave a relative feeling of appreciation for cultural advances in that area . " There were many people here who admired the cultural achievements of the Soviet Union but who do not like at all the tendency towards the suppression of individual freedom which apparently is growing more and more into what might be called a nationalist expansionist policy rather than the old style concepts of communism . This has created an adverse reaction among many people in India including some who were previously struck by cultural advances of Russia . "  | I asked him if Asia felt squeezed between the blocs of the United States and Russia . He said : " It is very difficult to distinguish between pure black and pure white . Maybe in a moment of crisis one would have to choose . That depends on the nature of the crisis . Naturally every country thinks in terms of its own survival and self-interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair . The prospect of a new war is too terrible to contemplate . Whatever other consequences there might be it would represent the degradation of the world . So one tries to avoid decisions in terms of a crisis , to the utmost . " Obviously at the present moment our contacts , economic and otherwise , are far more with what might be called the Western countries than with others . They are our trade and support . " To a good extent our political ideas and constitution have been derived from the West . To some extent also certain political ideas have been influenced by Socialist trends . " But Nehru made it clear by implication that he did not mean " Stalinist . " He said , " Our constitution may be considered as a kind of epitome of what we have been thinking . Our whole concept has been one of political democracy , but it has been influenced more and more by ideas of economic democracy . " On the subject of Pakistan , Nehru said the two countries were so close in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more closely than two friendly countries like the United States and Canada . Partition had cut up a living entity ? economic , psychological and cultural . Thousands of people on both sides were related to each other . The quarrel had the bitterness of a family quarrel but ultimately there must be developed common policies for economic , defense , transport , communications and irrigation affairs . I inquired what he thought of the chances of Titoism in China . He gave me his usual indirect answer : " Countries like China and India , not only by reason of their size , but also by reason of the essential national characteristics which are deeply imbedded , can hardly be expected to function on behalf of someone else . They may be affected by outside forces but they are bound to find some kind of level in keeping with the national genius . In the long run this is bound to happen . " Nehru said he  | was certain China could not grant prior allegiance to another country ? meaning Russia . He added : The Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansionist policy rather than the old-style concepts of communism . " He said the problems of Asia " can not be solved by military means . " Of Soviet ideology he observed : " Marxism is an analysis of history . The present-day Communists have changed this about a lot . Therefore I take what helps me from Marxism and discard the rest . " He added : " The people of Asia are in a state of acute mental change . They are more politically conscious than ever before as a result of the change-over from the period of colonial rule . Their first reaction is to expect a betterment of their economic condition . I refer to things dealing with the primary essentials of life . " That October in Washington , Dean Rusk , then in charge of Eastern affairs at the State Department , said Nehru , unfortunately , was doing what we did for twenty years : lecturing us upon our faults without participating in world affairs on a responsible basis , just the way we used to traditionally lecture the British on their administration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of what we think of them and not just continue to worry about what they think of us . On October 24 , 1951 , the first United Nations Secretary-General , Trygve Lie , told me he thought the Kashmir dispute the most dangerous quarrel then going on ? outside of Korea . Nehru had admitted to him in the past that his policy was to do nothing about settling the Kashmir question because he was convinced Pakistan can not survive as an independent state and will some day have to come " crawling back " to India . In New Delhi , November 2I , 1952 , Ambassador Chester Bowles ( who apparently got on well with Nehru ) , read me a letter he had recently sent to Secretary of State Acheson requesting the formulation of a long-range policy for India . The letter said : We are not facing up to the fundamental crises in Asia . A free India is vital to world peace and to our own security . We must build a program to meet the requirements of the situation . The choice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no other organized force . It would be   a catastrophe if the present government fails . One-sixth of the world 's population lives here . In the last war India provided an army of three million . A Communist India would help communism to dominate southeast Asia . India has rich mineral resources and a strategically important location . It defends South Asia . In Communist hands it would block the Suez Canal route to the East . India 's loss to the West would cause Moscow 's prestige to soar . Millions around the world would join the Communist bandwagon . Europe 's confidence in us would be deflated and Africa would blow up . The prospect of a free world would be jeopardized . What are the chances of India remaining free ? Paul Hoffman said that India in 1952 is like China in 1946 . This is too simple . There are certain favorable factors . India has a good civil service . Most of its leaders have a western tradition and are nonCommunists . They have an Anglo-Saxon respect for the law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The five-year plan is a good program for growth .

The Communists use this politically . The older leaders are tired . Some of the younger leaders have drifted toward communism . When Nehru dies , the Congress party will splinter . Nehru is the only cohesive force . He can not push through reform because of the complicated situation . There is a great need for land reform and the servicing of the debts of the poor , and the Communists stress these facts . The Indian educational system turns out streams of cynical youths . The caste system causes frustrations . There is a psychopathic fear of colonialism and racism . Furthermore , the Chinese have sold themselves well here . India needs United States aid to accomplish its five-year plan . This should come on the scale of aid to Greece . It would take less than $1 billion to get the five-year plan through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism goes into the villages . And communism is moving in . The youth must be given a sense of participation in progress . But the Congress party is too far removed from the people . The Chinese have given their people a sense of participation . For example , they build their own schools , physically speaking . P 179 We do n't understand the appeal of communism out here . At the lower levels the Communists do a good job of what passes for democratic participation . The people ask , " What shall we do ? " For those with their own political ideas , and therefore oppositional forces , there is the whip . But most people want only to build a better ditch . Their opinion is asked in terms of how can a better ditch be dug . But their opinion is asked for the first time . The Indian universities are turning out Communists . Bowles said Nehru used to be very violently against French colonialism . Now his attitude had grown somewhat softer . In fact , he would have probably been disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nehru was more anxious about nineteenth-century ( British ) colonialism than twentieth-century ( Soviet ) colonialism . Nehru saw new trends in our policy ; an ascendance of Republican belligerency . He thought the outgoing Democratic administration had been influenced by the recent elections . Nehru recognized that China was as hard to deal with as Russia . He admitted that it would take much longer before China broke loose from Russia than he had originally calculated . According to Bowles : India , it may be seen , is being stirred up with a great stick . All types of traditional systems are undergoing change : the caste system ; the educational system ; the old relationship between the landowner and the tenant . A Pandora 's box is being opened and nobody knows what will fly out . For example , as the illiterates are being educated , they learn to read Communist propaganda which unfortunately is better than ours . Nobody can foresee if and when a period of violence will ensue . In the United States when we had 15,000,000 out of work just after the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the workers had food in their stomachs the sit-down strikes started . Old structures are cracking up in India . The minds and the hearts of the population must be filled as well as their stomachs . Obviously the first stage in this great social development will create immense new problems . We must do more than help the Indian people fill their stomachs , we must also influence their minds . India is not a " Socialist " state . Her leaders do not think socialism will work . Thus , for example , India has guaranteed that   three new refineries we are helping to open up here will not be nationalized for at least twenty-five years . But although they are skeptical about socialism , the Indians do n't like British scarcity capitalism . We Americans would like to introduce our own incentive system and high wages rather than the restrictive British system of capitalism . That evening I saw Nehru in his residence . We sat in a relatively small study decorated with carved ivory . The two of us were perched upon a comfortable stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made one feel awkward . He was dressed in a long russet-brown Indian jacket and white leggings . He seemed relaxed and affable . Coffee was served and we smoked occasional cigarettes . But although he was cordial in his curiously diffident way , what he had to say was not of penetrating interest . Furthermore , I had a constant awareness of his mental arrogance and assumed contempt for the intellectual capacities of Americans . Time and again I asked him questions concerning ideologies , Marxism , and so on , and he gave me rather childish and , I thought , contemptuous ? certainly unsatisfactory ? replies . I noted : He is a confused man who is unquestionably enveloped in a cloud of his own egotism , which is obviously kept charged by admirers . That he is sincere , intelligent and potentially dynamic is beyond a doubt . Nevertheless , I had the feeling that he is groping his way through many difficult problems without a very clear idea of where he was going and without any preconceived plan , either moral , political or economic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tied up in the weary process of day-to-day administration that he no longer had a chance to feed a mind which requires the stimulation of continual new intellectual intake . We started off with a discussion of Marxism . He said that when he had read Marx and other books by Soviet leaders , he had been very impressed ; " but it was not the dogma I adopted . " He continued : " Marxism is an analysis of history . The present-day Communists have changed this about a lot . Therefore I take what helps me from Marxism and discard the rest . Socialism as such is   naturally making its way in the world through economic doctrines . Progressively in each country there is more and more social control by the state ? even in the United States . " Thus in India there is a definite tendency for the state to assume increasing control . But this is limited by a paucity of financial resources and of available administrative personnel . The state needs to control the key strategic vital sectors such as transportation . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely state-owned . Air India is one-half state owned although privately operated . " This was a rather vague definition ? if such it may be called ? of socialism , and I remarked as much to Nehru . I asked him if he felt himself socialistically inclined , and whether he considered having the Congress party adhere to the Second ( Socialist ) International . I pointed out that Marshal Tito had just told me he was contemplating having his People 's Front join it . Nehru answered that the Second International was merely a trade union organization . ( Of course , he was wrong there , but I did n't want to get into a debate with him . ) He said , " Our trade unions might some day join it , but the question has never come up . " I asked if India thought of signing any strictly defensive alliances with any powers or joining a mutual defense coalition of a regional nature . He answered , " No alliance is contemplated . After all , what is a strictly defensive alliance ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a military alliance is to deal with preparations for war . We are obviously interested in what happens along the regions near our borders ; his , for example , we are interested in what happens in Burma or Pakistan , but we are not resolved on any concrete policy of what to do . " I asked Nehru if he could explain to me in his own words just what it was that held India together as a state against the various centrifugal forces operating in this newly independent country . He replied : " In one word , it is a certain nationalistic sentiment . This goes deeply into the past . Throughout history you will find that , politically , India was often divided but it remained more or less a unit . The same ideas coursed through India , the same background of culture . The people never attached too much importance to politics . That was for the kings and emperors . Now to this matrix of a common past two or three germs of politics have been grafted . I must say that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | What did he think of the possibility , in long-range terms , of India federating in some fashion with Pakistan and perhaps Burma ? I pointed out that , after all , they shared the same common " matrix " of the subcontinent 's cultural past . He answered : Yes , that common matrix of culture is also applicable to Pakistan . We share the same community of history despite present differences on a purely political level . When Pakistanis and Indians meet ? aside from politics ? they do not meet as nationals from two different countries . They have the same background and speak the same languages . We are often misled by publicity given to extremist opinions in both Pakistan and India . But the masses of the people do not feel this . I do hope that India and Pakistan will cooperate in a very large measure . They should not lose their common tradition . They can not reverse history . They must increase the area of mutual cooperation . Groups of Pakistanis come here ? refugees from the Punjab . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss old memories . In the modern world unless we destroy each other by war , there must inevitably be larger spheres of cooperation ; regional cooperation and ultimately world cooperation . India , Pakistan , and Burma ultimately should cooperate in that way . Perhaps they might form some kind of superfederation but always keeping their identities . However , these things must develop automatically ? not artificially . India is a big country . It is frightfully difficult to define its idea and conceptions in a single phrase . But generally speaking , out approach to problems ? economic , political and so on ? is pragmatic , not dogmatic . Our new five-year plan will soon be out ? in a month or so . It may well be varied considerably from the original project as it is carried out . There are many uncertain factors . We based our five-year plan upon what I might call present advantage . The choice is between present advantage or future development . The Russians , in their five-year plans , have chosen the latter . But to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future but our first requirement is to plan for the present and this makes for a sort of juggling act . We  | must deal with a heavily populated country . There is not enough land to go around as there is in Russia . This , as Nehru indicated , was the reason that India was not planning for heavy investment in capital industry to anything like the degree of Marxist live-year planners such as in Russia and the satellites . Nehru meant that India must satisfy popular requirements for such things as consumer goods and keep the people happy . It was not a monolithic state that could order its helots around as does the Soviet dictatorship . Later , after an inconclusive conversation held standing up , Nehru guided me to the door and shook hands in a rather nervous , diffident way . Going down the stairs , as I passed through one of the salons , I noticed a curious melange of signed photos inscribed to Nehru . Standing on a table side by side were the pictures of the prime minister of Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman was in the middle ? whatever that signified . Nehru , during the agitated days when India was about to be partitioned , was held in jail along with his father as Earl Mountbatten , the last British viceroy , drove along deserted Delhi streets that had changed a great deal since the Pandit 's uncertain Cambridge days . Gandhi had decided that Jawaharlal was to be his heir , and that his Impulsiveness could be restrained . Just before Nehru took over the presidcncy of the Congress party , Gandhi 's faith in him underwent a searing test . ( Nehru was called upon to take part in a huge demonstration staged as a " reception . " He had become the " Jewel of India " to the mass of people , the " embodiment of sacrifice . " lc traveled third-class on trains , rode to villages in bullock carts , often walked vast distances to reach a meeting . He was so persuasive through his thoughts and actions that he had long since induced his Cambridge Moslem friendl , Syed Mahmud , to abandon comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into traveling without his servant . . Jawaharlal was certain that Hindu-Moslem collaboration within Congress and without was the kernel of Indian unity that they envisaged as a secular state . He made no pretense then , or later , of concealing his scorn for Mohammed Ali Jinnah , the proponent of a separate Islamic Pakistan . Isolating himself , Jinnah slowly developed his two-nation theory ? that Moslems formed one nation in India and Hindus another .  | Krishna Menon , the leftist Hindu , maintained : " The only man to lead India into the modern world is Jawaharlal Nehru . Gandhi ca n't do this . Nehru has a modern , scientific mind . " Menon dedicated himself to this man rather than to Gandhi . After his years in jail , Nehru was publicly cherished . But his social and international ideas were little understood by the Congress hierarchy . With many admirers , he still lacked disciples . He found one in Menon . Nehru wrote begging Gandhi to help some of Hitler 's Jewish victims find a new home in India . The Mahatma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ability . " Panditji , as he was more and more called , assessed Churchill , whom he would ultimately meet : " For all his courage and great qualities of leadership , he represents the nineteenth-century , conservative imperialist England , and seems incapable of understanding the new world with its complex problems , much less the future which is taking shape . " Nevertheless Churchill , surprisingly , had sent word through a mutual friend wishing Nehru well on a journey to China . His last word on Nehru would be that he was " fearless and without rancor . " The British had intercepted and arrested Nehru long before partition . He was put on trial in November 3 , 1940 , in the prison of Gorakhpur , where he made one of the great statements of his life . His culminating words were : " I saw the name of this appeasement and how the lamps of liberty were put out by war . " I am convinced that the large majority of people in England are weary of Empire and hunger for peace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with their government ... . With that we have nothing in common . " He said that he had been tried and convicted seven times . An eighth or ninth term made little difference to him . After his defense of humanity , he was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment . Even Churchill was said to have been shocked , and it is said Nehru came to the point where he could say it was " better to die than to live a miserable , hopeless life . Out of death , life is born afresh ... " At first , nobody knew where Nehru and his comrades had been taken . For two years they were never to see a single Indian except each other . Nehru , closed away from the world in Ahmednagar Fort , needed some creative outlet . In April 1944 , he wrote his third and last book , Discovery of India . It was natural that Panditji , with a policy of his own , had no desire that American influence should replace British . Naturally , the United States aimed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the aim  | would be foiled . Nehru 's primary concern was the concept of One World . In Delhi , Nehru was handed power by the British and sworn in as Prime Minister . He began to govern India at midnight on August 14 , 1947 , saying : " Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny , and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge , not wholly or in full measure , but very substantially . . . . A moment comes but rarely in history , when we step out from the old to the new , when an age ends , and when the soul of a nation long suppressed , finds utterance . " Prime Minister Nehru 's faith in the United Nations could not reconcile itself , after Pakistani troops entered Kashmir , to the idea of an Indian army sweeping them back . Either as his own decision , or together with Lord Mountbatten , he insisted the case of Pakistani aggression be taken to the U.N. , where it remained unsolved for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shock at the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi , shot because he had violated Hindu prejudice in asserting the brotherhood of Moslems , Parsees , Hindus , Sikhs , Christians , and Jews within India . The policy of nonalignment was evolved by Nehru and Menon in stages , the first being that of the rather nebulous Third Force . " Nonalignment " subsequently emerged , the designation being devised by Krishna Menon . Nehru explained in 1954 , when nonalignment became a cornerstone of Panchsheel ? coexistence ? that his foreign policy was " not born out of sharp intellect , but is the direct result of the freedom movement . " It was a means of achieving economic assistance from the two Power Blocs . Nehru 's first statement as Member for External Affairs in an Interim Government had said : " In the sphere of foreign affairs India will follow an independent policy , keeping away from power politics of groupings aligned one against the other . " The mode was to serve as a bridge between the two power groups in the hope that hostility between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at heart Nehru came nearer to being an unorthodox Buddhist than anything else . Whatever he derived from his extensive study of Buddhism appears to have been applied to relations between nations in the preamble to the Panchsheel agreement . Five principles were laid out ? among them , mutual noninterference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , and lasting peaceful coexistence . To draw China into the community of nations was a cornerstone of Nehru 's foreign policy . He always insisted that " whether we like that shape and form or not " of the Marxist China which had emerged victorious , " we  | have to recognize that a great nation has been reborn and is conscious of her new strength . " Between mid-summer 1954 and April 1955 , when the Bandung Conference opened in Indochina , Nehru stood out as a unique negotiator . In October 1955 , he accepted Prime Minister Chou En-lai 's invitation to Peking . He returned deeply impressed by China 's economic progress . At a press conference on his return , Nehru said : " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give guarantees or to demand them , but rather to understand , to be impressed and to impress in a friendly way . " Yet his prejudices appeared increasingly . Nehru said he recognized the right of any country to enter into military alliances for its own protection , but NATO appeared to have been molded into a " protector of colonialism " especially in Morocco , Tunisia , and Algeria . Nehru 's anti-colonialism was only directed against the West , never against the Soviet Union . He used the same kind of double-think as Secretary of State Foster Dulles when he argued that India could n't be more " helpful " on Israel because he did n't dare to inflame India 's Moslem minority of 40,000,000 . In February 1957 , when my wife and I were passing through India , Nehru very kindly asked us for lunch , a long meal , two and a half hours sitting under a peach tree with drifting pink blossoms . Marina approached the prospect rather warily , having conceived an innate dislike and mistrust for this famous man ( whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in about thirty seconds our charming host , handsome , courteous , and sensitive , had her eating out of his hand . Nehru was wearing a white Gandhi cap which he later took off , exposing a sudden bald head much paler than his sunburned face . Also white , tight pants and a buttoned , homespun jacket . A rose was inserted in the second buttonhole . He had returned and was going off again on his electoral campaign . Indian elections were very different from those in the United States , where radio and television had assumed such importance . Direct contact with the masses , public appearances , and speeches were the thing in India . Nehru professed astonishment at the interest and patience of people who came out in the thousands , waited for hours in the hot sun , and then listened with great attention . I asked if he tried to discuss local issues , he said no ; he did n't even know them . He left that to others . He talked about broad things : " Even international affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress had a set rule to encourage them : to have 15 percent of the candidates women .  | I asked what in his opinion was holding India together . He said : Culturally we are remarkably united . In a sense it is like the old idea of Christendom in Europe ? but even more intense . Political divisions did n't upset the idea of a common culture here . Our chief places of pilgrimage are widely separated ? south , east and west ; there were constant streams of pilgrims coming and going to them from all over India . Another factor that was very important in the past is Sanskrit . This language has not been spoken since the days of Buddha ? 2,5oo years ago . But it is still the language of the learned . And then , the modern theme of unity was , strangely enough , brought about by Britain . The British enforced their unity . And our opposition to their rule was a unifying factor . The Congress party started seventy-one years ago as a small movement , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectually united against an external danger . But when we get complacent internally then we fall out . When we had finished our enjoyable lunch , Nehru suggested we come and look at his pet pandas . He led the way to a large wire cage under a tree . I noticed he put on a pair of white cotton gloves before opening the cage to try to induce his pets to eat . They ignored his persuasion . " I ca n't get them to mate either , " he remarked in mock disgust . Again he tried to persuade , first one panda and then the other to eat . But neither responded . I watched his face set in stubborn lines as his pets thwarted him . He was determined to bend the white-faced , cuddlesome pandas to his will . When they continued to refuse to oblige him , his lower lip pouted . He had to give up . I le pulled off his gloves , and I noticed his hands . They were not elegant hands to match the rest of his physiognomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to manual work . He had been to Washington and I asked him his impressions of Eisenhower . These were interesting : I was greatly impressed by the President . He is a big man and very frank . That is a great thing . But I do n't understand from a practical point of view what your military policies can lead to . I am not suggesting that a country should be weak . But all that talk of strength and problems . Keeping a country strong is all right ;  | but nevertheless one should n't speak of this strength too much . It is not secret that you are strong . And the Soviet Union is always talking about its strength also ? even in a threatening way . I mentioned all this to President Eisenhower ? with some hesitation . I told him you were giving help to other nations which was a very good thing . But so much of it was in the form of military aid ; and that does n't really help any country . Giving this aid to some countries merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you become associated with that in their public opinion . President Eisenhower admitted as much to me , and he said it was indeed a problem . I remarked to the Prime Minister that in one of our previous talks I had asked on which side India would be in case of war . He had replied reluctantly that in the end it would be with the West because of a common political tradition and a dependence on maritime commerce . He commented querulously : Did I say that ? Really ? Well , most of our economic contacts are certainly with the West ? our intellectual contacts also . And the mere fact of English being used and known here as a language and in our periodicals and books is important . Furthermore , of course , there is the bond of our governmental and parliamentary systems . But in the event of a war ? I just do n't know . We would certainly try and keep out of it . And what developments would lead into ? I do n't know . Geographically we are favorably situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motilal Nehru had said of his son : " He is a jewel of a man and a perfect gentleman . He trusts everybody for he thinks others are like himself . Remember , people will take undue advantage of him . 1 Ie will be duped and deceived often . " After a pause , he concluded : " But he is not to blame . He has led a sheltered life and not seen the seamy side of it . " This was scarcely an accurate assessment . Of course , the seamier realities of Panditji 's life came after his father 's death , although the two had actually served simultaneous jail terms under the British . The great strains , such as the Kashmir crisis , threats of war with Pakistan ( which never broke out while Nehru was alive ) , the mass religious fratricide of partition and the  | actual war with China , all occurred later ; also personal losses such as the death of his dear friend , Lady Mountbatten . In the last months of Nehru 's life , it would frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress sometime in 1955 . It was said that by compromising on the issue of reorganizing state boundaries according to language , he unwittingly opened the door to endless linguistic friction . In 1955 an announcement came that evoked a great deal of discussion and speculation : Mrs. Indira Gandhi was named to join the Congress Working Committee and , therefore , become one of the country 's policy makers . Mrs. Gandhi was an outstanding personality : attractive , intelligent , ambitious , tough . Yet when asked , Nehru said it was very unlikely that his daughter would succeed him . He had certainly not been grooming her to do so . Nobody equaled Indira Gandhi in knowledge of what it meant in terms of responsibility and problems to accept the leadership of India . From 1947 onward , many of the most difficult tasks were assigned to her , or she voluntarily took them up . Less of a natural optimist than her father , possessed of a severely critical mind , Indira Gandhi herself had been conscious for a number of years as to where the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahatma Gandhi , like Mao Tse-tung of China , had devised the method and led the Indian revolution for independence . Her father , Panditji , had guided and organized it like Chou En-lai to the north . It was up to her to shape its strength and maturity . Nehru had been particularly close during his life to his father , to his lovely wife , Kamala , who died of tuberculosis in 1936 , to Gandhi , to Krishna Tenon , and to the beautiful , stimulating Edwina Mountbatten . And of course to his daughter , Indira . Jawaharlal was both delicate and strong , as one could judge from his relatively frail body , well-cut features , and powerful hands . He survived well , living to the age of seventy-five . Ten of those years had been spent in prison . Prison was the only place where he did any writing . To my taste , his writing was undistinguished and not to be compared with his personality , character , conversation , and oratory . Philosophically , he was a tolerant man , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crises . He used to say : " We must   always remember that every Indian to whatever religion he might belong is a brother and must be treated as such . . . . Long ago the Buddha taught us this lesson . From the day of Ashoka , 2,300 years ago , this aspect of our thought has been repeatedly declared and practiced . In our own day Mahatma Gandhi laid great stress on it and indeed lost his life because he laid great stress on communal good will and harmony . " In 1965 he wrote the president of the Indian Buddhist Society : " I do not participate in functions for the propagation of any religion . " A year later he wrote again that " I do not believe in what might be called institutional religion . " From this it might appear that he was relatively more Buddhist than Hindu , the creed of his parents . But that is an unfair deduction . He was simply tolerant of the spiritual beliefs of others . . . . On his bedside table the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was found a verse in his own handwriting that he had copied from the American poet Robert Frost : The woods are lovely , dark and deep But I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep , And miles to go before I sleep . In his will he requested : " A small handful of my ashes should be thrown into the Ganga Ganges . . . . My desire to have a handful of ashes thrown into the Ganga at Allahabad has no religious significance so far as I am concerned . I have no religious sentiments in the matter . I have been attached to the Ganga and the Jumna rivers in Allahabad ever since my childhood and as I have grown older this attachment has also grown . " Indira Gandhi , Nehru 's only child , was the next great figure to rise in the Indian firmament , after inconclusive rivalries between less visionary and more politically obsessed traditional leaders . Indira was undoubtedly a tough , resolute , wily chief of government who knew a great deal about politics before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had the additional advantage of her family 's good looks , with dark , aquiline features , mobile mouth , expressive eyes , and the Indian woman 's inborn gift of seemingly quite unconsciously knowing how to twitch a sari at the shoulder in a fetching and becoming manner . She was undoubtedly a determined and ambitious woman ; ambitious for herself , her country , her special ideas of the world including an increasingly important India , and a strong affection for her somewhat tactless and unscrupulous politician son , Sanjay .   This combination of qualities made for a very complex and interesting personality . She was resourceful and flexible , having recovered from a severe political defeat in defense of Sanjay . Some people at the time compared this with Nixon 's disaster of 1974 . But she was completely restored , never losing her poise and regaining her full power . I found her very " human , " enjoyable to talk with and with at least as much charm as her legendary father . One reason I suspect that she seemed closer , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jawaharlal always made a point of the fact that he was not grooming his daughter to succeed him or to take high office . She was a small woman with dark brown eyes and hair that was black before it grayed . Despite her powers of decision and crispness , on occasion , she was distinctly feminine . I once remarked to her that there must be both advantages and disadvantages to being a woman chief of government . She said : " I do n't think it really makes any difference . Obviously every person has some advantages and some disadvantages on a job like this . For India you can have pluses and minuses in terms of the region you come from or the caste to which your family belongs . Some people say that a woman has n't as much stamina as a man . Of course , I ca n't tell , never having been a man . But I certainly have more physical stamina than anyone else around here . " I observed that , in any case , a woman prime minister might benefit because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said she with only half a smile . " They surely are no more polite . Do n't think that . " I said her father 's ideology had been described frequently as Fabian socialism although I personally thought that a rather fuzzy label . How would she describe her own ideology ? She answered : I do n't think I can be said to have any ideology at all in this vague sense . After all , I have to face specific problems and specific situations . You just have to find the best way of doing things as they arise . Sometimes you just have to compromise with what you would prefer . For example , we did n't want to import food . But we had to ; it was a matter of life and death . Our party wants to use the tool of socialism to raise living standards , but this obviously is n't necessarily the socialism of other countries . Our methods must be fitted to the minds and the backgrounds of our people . Essentially , there are no two ways open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and so backward economically that you ca n't afford to just let things take their course . The people wo n't wait  | that long . The state must take things upon itself . It would just create more problems were we to leave everything to private enterprise . Private enterprise always seeks to make a profit and you ca n't have a profit in all the aspects of the problems facing us , above all with the enormous need for social justice and for welfare . We must be pragmatic . It 's hard to say just what our ideology is . We use the word socialism as the nearest thing . But there is no particular prophet of our socialism . We are seeking a new and middle path . We believe in a mixed economy . Apropos of ideological trends , I asked her what writers or persons had had the greatest influence in shaping her ideology and personality . She replied : I suppose the influences were mostly Indian . I was a very voracious reader and when I was a child I simply devoured books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know Americans would never have heard of the others . My father , of course , exerted an influence , but my mother quite as much . And you must remember that my childhood was right in the middle of our freedom struggle . Therefore , I was impressed at the time by any stories having to do with freedom anywhere . As a small girl I was told about Joan of Arc , about Garibaldi in Italy , and about many others . I got the impression from these remarks and from a later aside on her grandfather that she was n't quite as influenced by her father as many people make out . She wanted to stand on her own feet , to be accepted by and as herself . I said her father had once suggested to me that the next generation of India 's political leadership would suffer the disadvantage of not having been heroes of the revolution and the freedom struggle . She commented : " This is no longer the case . For our younger generation , the years of the freedom struggle no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's not that they are bored ; they simply accept the fact that freedom is here . " I asked if her late husband 's family had any connection with Mahatma Gandhi . She said : " My husband 's family was Parsee , originally from Persia . There was no relationship with the Hindu Gandhis . And the voters are n't in  | the least concerned with the fact that I 'm Nehru 's daughter . After all , I established my own political life . I entered the working committee of the Congress party in 1955 and I had been working at the village level long before . I became president of the party in 1959 . And do n't forget , my husband was very well known at the village level before his death . " I asked whether the essential policy of nonalignment was practical any more in a world where " imperialism " and " colonialism " no longer played a prominent role . She answered that nonalignment remained valid . There was nothing " dogmatic " about it . It just means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or political bloc . In fact , nonalignment is very valid as a concept now because more and more countries are subscribing to it . The world was very sharply divided between Eastern and Western blocs , involved in a cold war , when we started this policy . Only later a period began in which the outlines of this cleavage were more blurred . The cold war is still on in a way but many people are crossing the barriers of alignment into each other 's camp ? on such matters as trade , culture , and other relations . They work more and more with the people of the other bloc than their own . Therefore it is really the concept of alignment that has changed , not the concept of nonalignment . India never wanted to be part of a special bloc for two obvious reasons . First of all , there is our geographical position , our neighbors . And then , if you are aligned , you irritate those who are not in the same bloc . Certainly that 's not worthwhile . I observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were overdependent on Russia because it was so heavily the source of the country 's military equipment nowadays . She said : " That 's the argument of the Swatantra and the San Sangh the extreme right-wing parties . But , in fact , we do n't wish to be dependent on any country or any group . We are now seeking , and will always seek , more diversification in the sources of material and to get things where we can . We want to stand on our own feet and we try our hardest to be self-sufficient . And remember this ? just because we get equipment from a country does n't mean we 'll do what they want . We wo n't do what anyone wants simply because we get hardware there . " I asked if ideology represented any barrier between India and the  | United States . " Not for us , " she said . " What does come up is this sort of thing . When we learned that the CIA was indirectly financing institutions that were helping us there was a wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we have no ideological divisions ; I have none and I hope the majority of us do n't . " Some people in the United States say that we are too close to Russia and that we vote too often on the Soviet side in the U.N . But this really is n't so ; it is only true on such issues as those involving colonialism and racism , and here it is not a question of us following the Russians but a question of the Russians taking the stand that happens to agree with ours . The Russians have simply shown a greater understanding of the needs and mentality of newly freed peoples . And when you are so close to pre-independence times and attitudes as we still are , you remember these things very well . You are a little touchy on some of these matters . It takes time to adjust and to get used to being a country . " I asked how she felt about the " Brezhnev doctrine , " under which Moscow claimed the right to interfere in other " socialist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of all other states to independence . Each country must be free . The only thing in the U.N. , during the debate on Czechoslovakia , was that we did n't want to condemn ' Russia because we had never used the word condemn ' before . But we made every point stressed in the U.N . debate right here in our own parliament , and before these points were made in U.N . I wish to be very clear about that . " Once I asked Mrs. Gandhi if she would agree to tell me a bit about her private life . She nodded amiably and said that , while she did n't have much spare time , " I try to squeeze private things in when I can . Of course , I have no rigid schedule , but I like to see my family when I can . Normally I take my meals with my family . And if I have a moment , I like to go to exhibitions ? sculpture , painting , manuscripts , tapestries , all kinds of things ? on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I rather like classical music ? Bach , but also folk music , also Indian music . " I do my reading mostly while traveling or on weekends . On the whole I prefer reading something that retains my interest . You know , with detective stories I either guess who did it or I look at the end to see . So that does n't really do . " I asked if she actually enjoyed being prime minister . She smiled and said : " You know , I had a very strict training . My grandfather , who died when I was thirteen , brought us up in a most Spartan way . There was n't even any heating for us young people during the winter in Allahabad where we lived . My grandfather told us : You can never do anything well unless  | you enjoy it . If you think a job is boring or a drudgery you will never succeed in it . ' I guess that is your answer . " Indira , who was called " Indu " ( the moon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian youngster , visiting Italy and attending the International School in Geneva . As her family became increasingly engaged in politics , she is said to have dreamed at times of becoming her country 's Joan of Arc . When she finally married ? to the Parsee Feroze Gandhi ? Mahatma Gandhi , no relative of the bridegroom , stood with the family . As India gained its independence and Nehru was chosen prime minister , he asked Indira to become his hostess . She had already been drawn into the political world , having spent a year in prison as a rebel against British rule , and now she was to learn both more about politics and something about the international diplomatic world . Inevitably , Peroze receded into the background to lead a more separate life . Despite periods of conflict , the marriage did not break up . For all Indira 's seemingly retiring quality , she had an imperious temper . She was a boiling cauldron , with a deceptively calm surface . The one person who believed Indu could transcend the insecurities of her youth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , she was no longer a mirror reflecting himself . What he did not grasp , apparently , was the burden of isolation he was willing upon her . She was not akin to her aunts , who enjoyed the fruits of power . Yet she would , without lifting her little finger , be reckoned the most powerful woman in all India , where many powerful women were emerging . During her year in prison she had looked after a woman prisoner 's child to steady herself . As Maria Seton wrote : " Complex facets of her personality emerged : one , intimate , leisurely and provocatively intelligent with the strongest inclination for the company of creative people ; the other side , business-like , cool in appraisal , and with a swift withdrawal to irritability , when interrupted by a member of the staff about some formal arrangement to he made . " When the 1958 Congress party session took place , no candidate for the Congress presidency for 1959 presented himself . Both Mrs. Annie Besant and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu had been presidents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman holding the office . Mrs. Gandhi 's name was put forward . The moment she became Congress president both the sophisticates and opponents of her father became convinced that the Prime Minister had schemed his daughter 's election and had been grooming her to become his successor . She strongly denied this .  | Later when she reached the acme of power as chief of government , she was asked whether the office had been " thrust upon her . " She replied : " It ca n't be thrust upon me if I do not want it . " In her father 's postscript to his letters to her , he had said , " Personal misfortune is of little account in this world of sorrow and strife , which demands from us all our strength in the struggles that convulse it . " He had recounted the history of humanity , its failures and its triumphs with the accent on revolutions . In his letter for her thirteenth birthday he wrote : " You are fortunate , I have said , in being a witness to this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jawaharlal Nehru said of his daughter when she was elected Congress president : " It goes without saying that I have great affection for her . I have known her closely and it is possible my assessment suffers from imbalance . But I have great regard for her qualities and temperament , her energy and her integrity . I do not know what she has inherited from me . I am inclined to think she has derived these qualities from her mother . " Thus , of the three great revolutions that have taken place during the twentieth century , only India 's has been largely a dynastic , family affair ? and that only by chance . Lenin 's Soviet revolution saw its progenitor succeeded by a man who was not only unrelated but of a different race ( not Slavic but Georgian ) and one of whom he disapproved , Iosif Stalin . Mao 's successor in reality was Chou En-lai , a man much more like Nehru , worldly and intellectual . Chou ran the show because Mao was virtually in his dotage during his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Mao and Chou has probably not yet run its course but there is nothing remotely dynastic about it . The hereditary vigor of independent India 's first family is fascinating . Grandfather Motilal , originally a rich and somewhat snobbish Brahmin bourgeois , gave up all for Gandhi 's revolution , went to prison for it , and was chosen president of the Congress party . His son Jawarhalal was an unusually cultivated , stylish man who hid his great strength and energy behind a silken exterior . And his daughter , Indira , had equal charm and culture , enough strength to lead and fight two wars and to stage a wholly unexpected comeback from the ashes of internal political dispute . The leadership strain runs strong . It is sad that the daughter was murdered by Sikh fanatics . Indira 's indicated successor , Sanjay , her older son , died young . His younger brother Rajiv started off well . It is too soon to forecast the result .  | The Drunken Cobbler and His Son : Vissarion Djugashvili and Iosf Stalin The fact that Stalin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy certainly had a profound effect on the youngster 's subsequent life and , therefore , upon the history of Russia and the world . Being beaten was both painful and humiliating , as Stalin discovered , and he relished subjecting his opponents to this double punishment . " Beat , beat and once again , beat , " he commanded the prosecutor of the " Doctors ' Plot " in which confessions were thus extorted from Jewish physicians falsely accused of planning or attempting to murder Soviet leaders . Constant and undeserved , dreadful beating in his youth had given the heartless dictator a very special reverence for this form of brutality , partly because of his own victimization and partly because Vissarion I ) jugashvili , the father , had similarly tortured Iosif 's mother , whom the boy clearly loved and also respected . It is paradoxical but obvious that Djugashvili , the good-for-nothing and virtually illiterate cobbler in Gori , a small town of the Czarist Russian province of Georgia , should , thanks to his cruel treatment of a runtlike son who was to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound influence on world destinies . Georgia is not and was not then the least bit Slavic , much as Stalin himself hated to admit this . He was a non-Slav who became a pan-Slay . Much of his early life was indeed paradoxical and produced unanticipated results . Subconsciously or consciously he applied on an unimaginably vast scale the lessons he drew from his early unhappy provincial experience . His only education was at a parochial school run by the Orthodox Church in Gori and at a Tiflis religious seminary that accented Christian   theology and supposedly prepared the majority of its graduates for the Orthodox priesthood . Yet , for as long as this world survives , Iosif Vissarionovitch Djugashvili , who chose the alias of Stalin ( Russian for " steel " ) by which he is known , will be an object of keen attention . Dozens of studies , memoirs , and analyses of Stalin have already been published in every major language . The great majority of these are exceedingly hostile and unfavorable , with the exception of what has been written in the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with the tight disciplinary approval of an all-extensive censorship . Some of Stalin 's and Stalinism 's enemies managed as " dissidents " to prepare manuscripts of a more objective nature that have been smuggled and published abroad . Other students of Marxist-socialism have passed through pro-Stalin periods of obsession and escaped these to recount their former belief in " The God That Failed . " There are a few odd originals in the collection of authors so far extant on Stalin . First is his only daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva , whose Twenty Letters to a Friend and Only One Year ( the first written in Russian and smuggled abroad ; the second written abroad ) are in many ways contradictory in their impact on a reader , the Letters being far warmer and affectionate in their attitude to her father than the second , perhaps more mature and experienced volume . Another original is Conversations with Stalin by the redoubtable Jugoslav , Milovan Djilas , who became an ardent Communist in his youth , was imprisoned by his country 's royal regime , then was named general in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation forces , rose to the top in the Tito hierarchy , and , as the Partisans ' best Russian speaker ( with others ) , represented it in all conversations with Stalin . He stood firmly by Tito when the latter broke with Stalin and his allies in 1948 , and subsequently broke with Tito himself , became a liberal-socialdemocrat , and was returned to jail for two more long terms ? this time sent by his comrades . To show how powerful and complex a personality Stalin was , I shall quote from a few of those who had a chance to know him personally , even a little . In 1983 Djilas made two devastating remarks in conversations with me : " Stalin was a liar , but he believed his lies ; he was a demagogue who believed his own demagogy . " A few days later ( we were on a fishing trip in Serbia and had ample time to talk ) , he made the extraordinary observation that " Stalin was the worst killer in all history . Even Genghis Khan never killed any Mongolians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Slays . He was worse than Hitler . Hitler exterminated the Jews , but he treated them as a   people having two loyalties and therefore not being totally German . Stalin simply exterminated anybody he felt like getting out of the way . " To me this was somewhat of a non sequitur . Hitler killed many non Jews , including Catholics , Protestants , Communists . Stalin killed many Jews ? and was getting ready to increase the number when he died . In the French edition of Conversations , Djilas writes : " Stalin is a vampire who still influences and will continue to influence the world for a long time . Nobody wishes to be his inheritor , but many derive their strength from him . . . . Khrushchev renounced him , but that did n't prevent him from admiring him . The present Soviet leaders do n't admire him , but they are warmed by the same sun . " " I admit he continues to haunt me , " he added in conversation . Djilas , in Conversations , cites Trotsky as calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which is n't that far off from Lenin 's opinion . As he lay dying , the founder of Bolshevism dictated a letter to his wife in which he said , " Stalin is too brutal " to succeed as boss and should , as Djilas interprets it , be bypassed for someone more loyal , more polite , more patient . Djilas , an exceptionally courageous fighting man , and one capable of being pretty tough to prisoners , wrote that Stalin knew he was one of the cruelest and most despotic personages of history , but it did n't bother him so long as he applied history 's verdicts . " Despite his mass murders , his conscience was never troubled . " , There is no doubt Stalin 's views were cynically realistic . Djilas quotes him accordingly : " This war does n't resemble those of the past . Whoever occupies a territory imposes his own social system . . . . The whole world imposes its system as far as its army can advance . " On February to , 1948 , Djilas headed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visited Moscow . They discovered Stalin was getting ready to put an end to the Greek civil war in which that country 's Communists , aided and armed by Communist Albania , Jugoslavia ( it was just before the break with that land ) , and Bulgaria , were trying to oust the royal government and take over . Stalin asked Kardelj , Tito 's vice premier , what he thought the chances of success were . Kardelj answered he thought good ? " if foreign intervention does n't increase and political errors are n't made . " Stalin interjected : " If ! If ! No , they have no prospect of success at all . What do you think , that Great Britain and the United States ? the United States , most powerful nation in the world ? will permit you to break their line of communication in the Mediterranean Sea ? Nonsense . And we have no navy . The uprising in  | Greece must be stopped , and as quickly as possible . " ( It may be added that Moscow gave no direct aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own satellites did . ) Stalin was frightened about possible adverse consequences arising for the U.S.S.R. and for world communism from the Greek civil war , and every known discussion he had on the subject stressed Soviet naval weakness and Anglo-American naval strength . In 1944 Churchill and Stalin had an argument about Bulgaria when they bilaterally divided up the Balkans in a terse , checked-off working paper . When Churchill kept on emphasizing what jackals the Bulgarians had been during World War II , Stalin said it was improper to base foreign policy upon " motives of revenge . " What should it be based on ? Churchill asked . Stalin : " Upon the calculations of forces . " In the days before Admiral Gorshkov had built a mighty blue-water fleet for the Soviets , and when America had overwhelming nuclear superiority , the balance of forces in the eastern Mediterranean was strongly against Russia . Stalin knew it and acknowledged it . Churchill was more interested in individual human beings than in ideology . On July Io , 1956 , during a day I spent with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : " I think Stalin was a great man ; above all , compared to Khrushchev and Bulganin who had by then come to power , Stalin never broke his word . We saved Greece that way . " ( He was referring to the restoration of independence to Greece when the Germans fled northward ) . " When we went in , in 1944 , Stalin did n't interfere . You Americans did n't help , you know . " What most people say of Stalin is that he was a brutal , murderous despot , but they disagree on whether he accomplished much or helped his nation or its people . De Gaulle called him " this great czar . . . with the shadowy charm . Stalin was a great man . He did something . He was a brutal man but he created a modern state . " Andre Malraux thought Stalin had been a devil , " but a great devil . " Djilas liked Churchill as a " romantic , " yet he acknowledged that Stalin , despite his brutality , was " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stalin had complete control of himself . He knew how to use power . And he had great charm when he wanted to use it , horrible as he was . He was brilliant but he killed as many men as Hitler . Hitler also was brilliant ; but mad and a fanatic . Stalin was cold and clear . " In Communist China everyone seemed to forget that during the last days of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai , when concentration was only on being anti-Russian , Peiping even thought Stalin good compared with his P 20I successors . In 1973 Chang Chi-cheng , a Shanghai ideologue , assured me : " We still think of Stalin as a great Marxist . " But the Soviet ambassador sneeringly told me : " The Chinese still listed Stalin with Marx , Engels , and Lenin only because he was admired for liquidating the kulaks and for building Soviet industry and military strength . " In November 1956 my wife and I attended Governor Averell Harriman 's small birthday party in Albany , N.Y . He told me Stalin was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met . He also said the Russian had a " genuine liking " for both Roosevelt and Churchill ( which I doubt ) . This may have been true ( although at best dubious ) , but as I came to know more about Stalin I learned that a " genuine liking " could be flicked away like an irritating eyelash when such a change suited Stalin 's fancied convenience . It is like Churchill 's recollection : " He never broke his word . " How about the very opening day of the Yalta Conference in February 1945 when Stalin totally called off his Berlin offensive and moved toward the Balkans instead , without even hinting at such a climactic move to his Big Three partners ? Stalin could be ? and often was ? a master of deceit ; a man without adjectives : plain , simple , abrupt . Djilas thought him " perhaps greater than Lenin . " He added : " His basic work , the Foundations of Leninism , published in 1924 from a series of speeches just after Lenin 's life ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said this long after Stalin 's death and disgrace Stalin is underestimated as a theoretician . But after Marx , theory was no longer important ; only practice . " Arvo Tuominen , last survivor of the Presidium of Lenin 's Comintern , said , " Stalin in the name of the Central Committee of the Communist party had practiced the most brutal violation of the socialist law , torture and violence that led , as we have seen , to the slandering and self-accusation of innocent people . " Andrei Sakharov , the eminent nuclear scientist and Soviet dissident , estimates that " no less than fifteen to twenty million Soviet citizens " were destroyed in Stalin 's prison camps . Yet , as Tuominen stresses in his The Bells of the Kremlin : " Stalin used many highly effective forms of propaganda but the most effective may have been the invitation of foreign delegations and tourists to the Soviet Union and their entertainment there , " a propaganda device used with " unique skill . " How long a jump is it from the wide-eyed Lady Astors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently but with equal effect these days ?  | Once I remarked to President de Gaulle that , like Macchiavelli , Stalin had named fear as the principal force motivating man . De Gaulle commented : " One must draw a distinction between the individual and the collective masses . For the individual , it is ambition and a taste for adventure . I think the real motivation , the primordial motivating force of the individual , is ambition ; for the masses it is fear . There Stalin was right . And this applies to the masses of all countries . " Opinions of Stalin , both Russian and foreign , Communist and antiCommunist varied immensely . But few of them , favorable or unfavorable , failed to discern his greatness . Malraux met Stalin only once ? at Maxim Gorki 's house . Stalin told him he adored Shakespeare and never missed a performance . His other hobby was the dance ? watching other people dance ( people like Khrushchev , as the latter acknowledged in his famous debunking speech of 1956 ) . Stalin told Malraux that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odd ? On rare occasions Stalin made evident pro-American gestures . When Harriman called on him at night to inform him of Roosevelt 's death in 1945 , Stalin acknowledged to him that Russia and America must now cooperate strongly . Three days later former U.S. Secretary of War , Patrick Hurley , on a mission as special American envoy in China , passed through Moscow after a London visit on his way to try and bring Mao Tse-tung and Chiang Kai-shek together . Hurley told me ( following a two-hour midnight conversation in the Kremlin ) : " I said I thought freedom was a logical necessary development of history and that any progressive country would face that fact . Stalin disagreed ; he laughed . I continued that , after all , Stalin could only judge by Russia and the Russians . Stalin laughed again . " Hurley curiously maintained that he had far less difficulty selling the idea of a free and united China to Stalin than to Churchill . " I had no trouble with Stalin , " he boasted . " He played ball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head examined . Hurley ought to have known Stalin was then backing Chiang against Mao , as proven in Yalta . ( Harriman cabled Washington asking that Hurley be warned not to believe everything Stalin said . ) Stalin sometimes could not conceal his contempt for the ignorance or inefficiency of foreigners . He told U.S. Ambassador Chip Bohlen that he had been in Germany around 1907 and a secret German Communist Party meeting was convened . The German comrades queued for subway tickets in orderly , tedious fashion ? and never showed up . Louis Joxe , French ambassador to the Soviets in the 1950s , explained to Stalin that the Atlantic Pact was a purely defensive peaceful alliance without  | any aggressive intentions . Stalin laughed and turned to Andrei Vyshinsky , who was there , saying : " If that is the case , why do n't we join , Vyshinsky ? " Joxe must have found the old tyrant in an exceptional mood . When he expressed polite pleasure at being received , Stalin replied like some old Mongol khan : " In this country even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of name for the East Prussian city of Konigsberg ( absorbed by Russia ) to Kalinin , Stalin remarked at the incongruity : " Kalinin ? and a king . " Kalinin was an unimpressive Russian Communist chosen for the unimportant job of president , a purely ceremonial function . Konig means " king " in German . Stalin treated his European satellites to all kinds of cock-and-bull stories . When Edvard Benes , Czechoslovakia 's prewar , president , visited him in 1945 as the war was ending , Stalin assured him earnestly there was " absolutely no thought of setting up any sort of puppet German government ( like the then Hungarian one ) . That only came by armed coup in 1948 . The little Transcaucasian town of Gori situated in the valley of the Liakhvi River in the former kingdom and the present Soviet republic of Georgia ( conquered by pre-Bolshevik czars ) , is famous for but one thing : Gori was the birthplace of Iosif Vissarionovitch Stalin , originally Iosif Djugashvili . Iosif grew up in an impoverished , rickety , rented hut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then on the outskirts of Gori . To honor Stalin , the shack he once called home has been lavishly encased in marble , much as if Abe Lincoln 's original log cabin had been placed within an alabaster palace . The town also contains a Stalin museum . Its principal interest to the contemporary visitor is found in a heavy-lidded , sensual death mask and in pictures adorning the wall , including one of little Iosif Djugashvili dressed as a choirboy . As a youngster Iosif , like his no-good father , was scrawny , small , clever , and obviously tough . He learned the art of survival the hard way . Vulgarity , obscenity , and brutal fights were not unusual in the shoemaker 's rude household . Although his mother loved him , she also beat him ; his father reacted by beating her . The boy then sought to defend her and once threw a knife at the savage little cobbler . Vissarion took out after him hollering , but neighbors hid the recalcitrant son . losif was the only one of four children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly poor . They lived in a neighborhood locally called the " Russian Quarter " because of nearby czarist military  | barracks . At the time of Iosif 's birth , Gori contained less than 9,000 inhabitants . As a youngster he was called " Soso , " which is the usual Georgian nickname for Iosif . Before his marriage , his father , Vissarion , had moved to Tiflis ( now Tbilisi ) where he found a job in a leather factory . When a man named Baramov started a shoe repair shop in Gori , Vissarion returned to his birthplace . There he met and eventually married a much younger woman named Ekaterina Geladze . Their house ? in fact but a hut ? was comprised of two tiny rooms used for sleeping , eating , and working . The cooking was done in a low cellar with a fireplace . Vissarion was thin and wiry , with black hair , beard , and mustache . He was a heavy drinker , gruff , and with a quick , sharp temper . He seems to have beaten both his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright , energetic , and good at games . He had an ear for music , and his high-pitched voice sang in the Gori church choir . He was very small in size , but strong , muscular , and basically healthy . His face was freckled , his nose prominent , and his eyes dark and glittering . Iosif Iremashvili , who knew Soso as a boy , recalled him as unemotional and never seen to cry . " As a child and youth he was a good friend so long as one submitted to his imperious will , " he added . Both parents were Georgian and not averse to violence . It is odd that , despite this background and the fact that he spoke Russian poorly with a marked Georgian accent , Iosif always preferred things Slavic and Russian to any Georgian connection . However , today , dead , he is regarded as a great hero in Georgia and condemned by most Russians . His father 's greatest achievement , before he finally was knifed to death in a drunken bar fight , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory . His mother was more ambitious . She desperately , if unsuccessfuly , sought to guide her boy into the venerated priesthood , thus improving the sordid existence lived both by her son and herself . She was genuinely religious and , still young when her husband was cut down , worked feverishly to support and educate her boy . Stalin 's daughter , Svetlana , indicates he held his mother in devoted esteem all his life . He described her as intelligent , if uneducated . She would smack him when he misbehaved just as she smote his father when be became obnoxiously drunk . Iosif was a hard-boiled , tricky village kid who had more than his share of rows with friends . The only hint of intellectual talent he gave at the seminary was in arithmetic and mathematics : He also liked to sketch crude  | little drawings which fostered a later habit of doodling . It is said he remembered some smattering of seminary Greek almost until his death . Whether this was the archaic spoken version of Orthodox prayers is hard to know . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latent signs of ambition in the boy so that he might climb life 's ladder . But , although theological education was the only formal learning he ever encountered , the church quite obviously had no appeal for him . At seventeen , he encountered and joined a Social Democratic group and began agitating among Georgian workers . In 1902 he was jailed for organizing demonstrations in the Black Sea port of Batum , and the following year he was exiled to eastern Siberia . That was the start of his real schooling . Yet Ekaterina still dreamed religion would triumph . When he called on her in 1936 , shortly before her death , she murmured to him ? the tyrant of all the Russians : " What a pity you never became a priest . " Djilas recalls that Stalin told him she once visited him at the Kremlin and was n't very impressed ; only regretted that he had chosen the wrong career . Had Stalin tended even slightly toward psychological complexes , his might well have been an Oedipal relationship such as Alexander the Great certainly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future dictator 's boyhood friend accordingly : " Iremashvili tells of brutal blows inflicted upon the boy by the frequently drunk Vissarion , and of the gradual growth of an aversion in Soso for his father . . . . He also developed the vindictiveness that would characterize him in later life , and became a rebel against paternal authority in all guises . " There is no doubt his intellectual determination grew under his mother 's urging . He graduated first in his class at the Gori parochial school , and the " Tiflis seminary admitted him on a full free scholarship . But he was poor material ; he had ceased believing in God at the age of thirteen , apparently after becoming acquainted with Darwinism . While still a student , he learned Russian well ( it had recently replaced Georgian and become mandatory for schools ) . However , he read widely among Georgian writers , and in one story about the famous tribal imam Shamyl he came across a literary figure named Koba , a fighter and avenger , and used the name as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . Iosif turned increasingly against the Tiflis seminary , which he saw as " jesuitical " and " in the pursuit of bad ends , " as he told Emil Ludwig , the German author . His hostility engendered the spirit of revolt which had been simmering since the earliest days of his paternal disputes . He even slackened  | his interest in study ? except for logic and secular history : better preparation for a revolutionist than for a cleric . He forsook his liking for games and read , read , read . It was while he was in his first prison camp that he chose his Russian pseudonym ? Stalin . It also started him on the road to Marxism . He ultimately wound up a Bolshevik follower of Lenin instead of becoming , like most other Georgian Marxists , a Menshevik . His ultimate dream was to be another Lenin , one of history 's " heroes . " As Khrushchev was later to depict him in his famous speech to the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet party , Stalin was by nature intolerant of criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered an " enemy " die or suffer , was deeply distrustful and suspicious , thirsted for glory , suspected plots all around him . It is noteworthy that none of these traits necessarily conflict with the first law of the Russian czar : " The Emperor of All the Russians is an autocratic and unlimited monarch . God himself commands that his supreme power be obeyed out of conscience as well as fear . " Stalin believed in limitless autocracy ? under him ; in absolute obedience ; in fear . He clearly did not believe in God . As an obscure worker in the Transcaucasus , Stalin started to revere Lenin as a Social Democratic leader ? a definition no Social Democrat would today accept . He was especially impressed by Lenin 's views on the doctrine of leadership in his pamphlet , " What Is to Be Done ? " It is strange to think of the physically and mentally unappealing Stalin , notable only for his ruthless will and courage , as so attracted by what he considered Lenin 's charismatic and messianic qualities . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear-cut , uncompromising views . Stalin acknowledged : " I was captivated by the irresistible force of his logic . " And he was fascinated that Lenin considered that a revolution in Russia would be but the first of a series of European socialist revolutions . As he read increasingly from the underground revolutionary pamphlets being circulated in Russia , and talked with revolutionists both inside and outside concentration camps , he became experienced in all the conspiratorial techniques of the time : robbing banks to obtain funds for arms and propaganda ; how to hide , change aliases , establish hidden contacts ; the art of escaping the most arduous confinement ; how to write for and edit insurrectional papers like Pravda . He was named to his party 's central committee and fought both the White Russian czarists and the Polish army during the civil war that followed the downfall of Nicholas II ? and then the liberal Kerensky.  | At the outset of the revolution , Stalin 's reputation was not outstanding . He was known as " touchy " and quick to hit anyone for uttering even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it became evident that he was intolerant toward those who disagreed with him and that he craved personal authority . He spread his reading to include Western literature and even wrote some unimpressive poems in Georgian , influenced by the language 's famous classic , Rustaveli 's The Knight in the Panther 's Skin . Marshal Voroshilov later recalled that Stalin had a good memory for quotations . His revolutionary activities steadily increased . Between 1902 and 1913 he was arrested eight times , exiled seven times , and escaped from exile six times . The February Revolution of 1917 freed him the seventh time ? from a remote icebox in the far north . Escapes from internal exile were not infrequent in those days ? before Stalin 's own regime . In his subsequent travels around Transcaucasia , he became wholeheartedly Leninist and also an ardent expert at " expropriations " ? bank robberies to raise party funds . He was sent abroad on brief trips to attend party congresses in Stockholm , Berlin , London , Cracow , and Vienna ? the first such major travel prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Churchill . In 1902 he married Ekaterina Svanidize , whose brother had been a fellow student at the Tiflis Seminary . In 1908 Ekaterina produced Stalin 's eldest child , a son named Yakov , who later died in a Nazi prison Camp . Ekaterina died in 1910 . Iremashvili , who attended the funeral , said Stalin pointed to the coffin saying : " This creature softened my heart of stone ; she died and with her died my last warm feelings for people . " He placed his right hand on his chest and added : " It is all so desolate here inside , so inexpressibly empty . " Yakov was brought up by his mother 's sisters . Following this personal tragedy , which clearly annealed a heart already turned to iron , Koba ? as he was increasingly known in the underground ? began to enjoy in the Transcaucasus the reputation of being a second Lenin , " the best authority on Marxism . " He was vividly attracted by the original Marxist dogma that a hostile proletariat and bourgeoisie were locked in deadly combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stalin 's initial personal contact with Lenin was by letter smuggled from Siberian exile in 1903 . He saw Lenin for the first time in 1905 at the Tammerfors conference in Finland and was greatly impressed . He soon began to try and emulate him , to identify with him , but this proved difficult . Lenin came from the minor bureaucratic nobility , was well educated , and 208 ? C. I. Sulzberger  | gave the impression of being a more intellectual , more normal , and more human personality . Nevertheless , Stalin unhesitatingly aped Lenin 's mannerisms and repeated his thoughts . Neither Stalin nor the Social Democratic element with which he had first associated were successful among Georgian revolutionaries . Stalin blamed Georgia for this , not himself . From then on he stressed more and more the " Russian " element in his spoken and written communications , and in what was to become " Soviet " history . He strongly attacked the " Jewish faction " as against the " true Russian faction " and proposed a pogrom in the party ? something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Djugashvili , representing the oppressed Georgian subject people , joined the Russian " nation " via Bolshevism . He tended increasingly to condemn Georgian nationalism ? a fact seemingly ignored or forgotten by today 's Georgians . As Lenin 's commissar for nationality affairs , he sneered at the " little piece of Soviet territory called Georgia . " As for his anti-Semitism ? it became obsessive , even within his own family circle and among his friends , as Svetlana , his daughter , strongly brings out . During the Bolshevik Revolution which overthrew Kerensky 's shortlived liberal interim government , Stalin spent an increasing amount of time with the Alliluyevas , a Marxist intellectual family that lived on the Gulf of Finland . Stalin eventually married Nadezhda ( " Nadya " ) , daughter of the household , a charming , humane girl who became Svetlana 's mother . Theirs did not prove to be a happy marriage , and in the end she died violently ? almost certainly of suicide , although some of Stalin 's enemies rumored that he had murdered her himself . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally seized power , the first functioning Politburo was created to govern Russia under Lenin , as chairman of the council , and Stalin was charged primarily with nationality affairs . Even before that , during the peak of the hodgepodge fighting , he was named director of food supplies in southern Russia and head of the war council of the north Caucasus military district . At Trotsky 's " categorical " insistence , Stalin was recalled from the Tsaritsyn ( later Stalingrad , then Volgograd ) Front , where things were going badly . Yet he remained Lenin 's deputy on the Revolutionary War Council and was elected to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee . Stalin saw Trotsky as an intruder trying to break up his own special relationship with Lenin ? and he always took pains to emphasize that the brilliant chief of the Red Army was a Jew . But Stalin won little military acclaim in the civil war , while Trotsky climbed upward . Stalin concentrated on continually amassing political influence in the Soviet regime itself . His  | war work , put succinctly , was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power than glory , despite the fact that he was an indifferent organizer and never cut out to be an administrator . What he did understand as well as any man who ever lived was how to dispose of his enemies . Trotsky claimed Stalin said : " The supreme delight is to mark one 's enemy , prepare everything , to avenge oneself thoroughly and then go to sleep . " Stalin prepared a long time and assiduously to inherit the leadership of Russia 's single party as it became increasingly evident that the ailing Lenin was doomed to an early death . He had already carefully read Macchiavelli 's The Prince in his final period of Siberian exile , terminated by the Kerensky Revolution . In that book he studied the Italian 's classic advice for the power-seeker . Once free , he carefully and shrewdly made his way up through the Orgbureau and gained a seat on the center of Communist bureaucracy , the Secretariat . When Lenin and Trotsky came to an ideological and methodological clash in that committee , he avoided opting openly and totally for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this occurred , that Trotsky , who had earned acclaim through his inspiring oratory and his military novelties , first suffered a serious political setback . Numbers of his supporters lost their seats on the Central Committee to avowed Stalinists . This was the first intraparty purge of Soviet history . Stalin did n't revise the existing machinery that had been set up ? but took it over and used it to his advantage . During these maneuverings , his young wife , Nadya Alliluyeva , was an important asset . She was given a variety of secret assignments by Lenin and certainly knew many of the supreme leader 's innermost thoughts , which , presumably , she shared ( to a degree at least ) with her dominating and , when he wished to be , charming husband . Iler background was quite different from the brutal , rough-edged , frequently violent Stalin . Although they were awarded an apartment in the vast Kremlin complex in 1919 , she saw to it that they also took over a country house , and there the family lived and Nadya built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son , Vasily ( who died a drunkard ) , and daughter , Svetlana ( who , for many years , lived abroad as a voluntary emigre ) . Stalin seemed to enjoy this life ? in which he rarely partook because of party and state assignments ? and he increasingly built up his " Russianness " at the expense of his Georgian heritage . Already in 1922 he was identifying himself as " a Muscovite " and commonly using phrases like " we Russian Bolsheviks . "  | After Lenin died and Stalin finally outmaneuvered his rivals and took control , he saw to it that each Central Committee secretary employed numerous assistants , and among them he placed persons he considered loyal to himself . They kept him informed of all state or party intrigues even before they had hatched . At a dinner of principal Soviet dignitaries in 1926 , he said , in a discussion of " collective leadership " : " Do n't forget we are living in Russia , the land of the czars . The Russian people like to have one man standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely a literate human being today who does not know the major events of Stalin 's career as Soviet leader . They marked Russia and the whole world for years to come . They are marking them today . No one will ever be able to calculate the lives lost through Stalin 's maneuvers or by his command . Millions of Soviet citizens died in horrendous concentration camps . Tens of millions died during his elimination of the kulaks ( small farmers ) to enforced collectivization . Tens of millions died in his illprepared , ill-disposed armies until by his own sheer stubbornness and strategic talent , the skill of his generals , Allied help , and the immense bravery of his troops , the tide of war turned from disaster to victory . The " cult of personality " which saw all these appalling disasters ( and I have referred only to the slaughter and destruction of the Russians , not their enemies ) truly began with the elaborately arranged propaganda accompanying Stalin 's fiftieth birthday celebration in 1929 . It kept mounting until Khrushchev cut his image down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in 1956 . In terms of international propaganda and politics , the personality cult was a markedly zigzag affair . Prior to his nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939 , all the right-wingers of the world were violently anti-Stalin , as symbol and boss of communism , while leftists hated Hitler and Mussolini so much that many became at least lukewarm Stalinists . Both factions , right and left , tended to split up into segments or modified their opinions from 1939 until 1941 , when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and came within an ace of smashing it . Stalin , the boss ( or khozyain , as the Russians put it ) , was held responsible for all the accomplishments and failures of that melodramatic period and above all for the limitless cruelty which devastated small farmers ; created needless famines ; wiped out or transported whole peoples such as the Crimean Tatars and the Chechen-Ingush ; ruthlessly shot innocent and harmless individuals as " Trotskyites , " " Fascists , " " Titoists , " " spies " ; constructed and populated enormous new concentration camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and scared everybody , including many officials who participated in these savageries , quite out of their wits . Most analysts agree with his daughter , Svetlana , that Stalin 's evil genius was the secret police boss Lavrenti Beria , a toadlike Georgian who somehow wriggled himself into Stalin 's total confidence . Beria was evil incarnate , a sadist , sex maniac , alcoholic , and ruthless liar with ambitions and a lust for power that vastly exceeded even his wicked abilities . But as the worst of the " Chekist " leaders ( so-called after Cheka , the abbreviation for the first " counterrevolutionary " police created by the Bolsheviks in 1917 ) , he came to symbolize the very worst and most bestial deviltries of the regime , even among its supporters . When Stalin died in 1953 , Beria hoped to gain supreme power ; instead , he was shot in a cellar at the command of the army and , once his demise was announced , with the support of the masses . I was an exceedingly naive young man of twenty-eight when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler had launched his blitzkrieg against the tyrant who had been his ally since August 1939 . I started from Ankara , Turkey , which was then filled with correspondents trying to get to Moscow : men and women of right , left , and center opinions , and representing all sorts of organizations . I worked for The New York Times and had habitually written of Stalin as " Hitler 's partner in depredation , " thus avoiding the label of outright " enemy " or " ally . " But I was the only one of the lot granted a visa . The Soviets desperately wanted a Times man there . My first glimpse of Stalin ? one which was repeated endlessly ? came in the form of long , rectangular posters depicting him in color , a stern yet benevolent-looking tall man in a long army greatcoat down to his ankles and a marshal 's military insignia . It was only much later , when I saw him close up in the flesh , that I realized his stature was diminutive , his face was pockmarked ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming and evidently shifty . My entry trip ? which was by train ? took over a week , so I had time to study that widespread poster frequently . It resembled the original , as I was to discover , as accurately as the khozyain himself resembled Sir Galahad . The best view I ever had of Stalin was from a press box to the right of the seats in the Kremlin hall where the Soviet Presidium met . Stalin was wearing a fawn-colored uniform with the decoration of Hero of Soviet Labor . I was about twenty feet away and at the same level . One could see his facial skin blemishes and the streaks of gray in his full head of hair . His  | mouth was disguised by a slightly drooping mustache ; it was impossible to mask his eyes , but his face was bland and self-satisfied . He seemed to be scribbling on a small pad : undoubtedly the doodles , or what psychologists call " automatic writing , " for which he was known . These included wolves , nooses , lopsided hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to persons who saw them close up in conferences . I could make out nothing except that he had strong , square hands with manicured fingernails . When he arose with the other delegates to applaud ? the subject generally being himself ? I noted his small stature and was surprised to learn later that he was even more diminutive than he appeared ? he was just under five feet five ? being given to wearing a form of elevator shoes . Quite some contrast to the huge poster figure whose features so frequently accompanied me on the bumpy railway tracks north from the Caucasus . I have said earlier that perhaps Stalin was the most successful statesman of his time , but I do not wish that to be taken as fulsome praise . He extended the country 's frontiers to include almost all the areas at one or another time ruled by the czar ? save for Finland , eastern Turkey , and bits of Iran and China . Far more important , he took a ramshackle impoverished land torn by two world wars , revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the two superpowers of the latter twentieth century , militarily perhaps supreme , technically in the foremost rank , with the first earth-girdler , the mightiest missile force , and a navy that became number one , quantitatively at least , after ending the war with only two capital ships , a battleship loaned for the duration by Britain , and a heavy cruiser borrowed from the United States . Soviet scientists , artists , technicians , and athletes are of the first rank , although some , like Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn have benefited less than somewhat from their eminence . The economy and agriculture are still a scrambled mess , but , seeing what the dictatorship has managed to accomplish in other fields , I see no reason to assume it will not master these problems . Popularity and trust are two things it seems unlikely that any Bolshevik regime will ever manage to instill in the patient , intelligent , brave , and durable Russian people , who make up the large chunk of the Soviet Union 's multinational population . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , and perhaps will always be that expressed by Nikolai Alexeivitch Nekrassov in his well-known poem : " Who Can Be Happy and Free in Russia ? " The inferential , deep-rooted psychological problem represented by this  | question and the lack of any kind of faith ? save for a primitive belief in " Russianness " that marked the tenets of the Orthodox Church when it was the official religion ? which attended even the least competent czars , and features Moscow 's interpretation of world Communist parties as its own private tool , is the astonishing absence of faith in humanity and human beings as such that one encounters in the U.S.S.R. Svetlana Stalin herself told George Kennan and Chip Bohlen in the United States that she was staying at Beria 's house on the June night in 1941 when Germany attacked Russia and Stalin telephoned her and ordered her home . Grumpily he asked : " Why at such a moment were you staying with a man I ca n't trust ? " This very question implicitly contains its own answer . During the Great Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including many who thought of themselves as loyal party members , were condemned as overt or covert enemies of the people so that Djugashvili , the little Georgian conspirator , could prove to himself and to the world that he was really Stalin , the man of steel , the great boss of Russia . Stalin had odd habits and few diversions . He rose very late in the day and worked very late at night , completely discomforting the lives of those who had to deal with him regularly . Djilas thought he drank only a little wine but ate enormously for a small man . Others have noted that he drank heavily on occasion and sometimes he even mixed red wine in the same glass as vodka . He liked well-cooked Caucasian and Russian food , but was essentially a man of far simpler tastes than , for example , Brezhnev . His vanity took absurd forms ; like jockeying for a position a step higher than others when photographs were being taken . He was a bad public speaker , whose voice did n't carry , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text , and who , although he deliberately played down his Caucasian origin , talked with a strong Georgian accent . He was enormously ambitious , wholly pitiless , and had been so since youth . In 1918 , during the civil war , he ordered a Caucasus official : " With respect to the Daghestani and other bands who are obstructing the movement of trains from the North Caucasus , you must be absolutely ruthless . A number of their villages should be set on fire and burned to the ground , to teach them not to make raids on trains . " Lenin , his one acknowledged hero ( save , perhaps , Peter the Great ) , produced more than one memorandum urging Stalin 's removal from the job of general secretary in order to reduce the danger of internal conflicts at high party levels . Lenin wrote : " Stalin is too coarse and this fault , though quite tolerable in relations among us Communists , becomes intolerable in the office of General Secretary . Therefore I suggest to the comrades that they think of  | a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to it who differs from Comrade Stalin in only one superiority : more tolerant , more loyal , more polite and more considerate of his comrades , less capricious , and so on . " No liberal himself and tough as leather on his opponents , Lenin preferred not to insult them or injure their self-respect . Stalin , on the other hand , simply sought to break them to his will like unruly horses or to roughly cast them aside . He wished to humiliate and degrade people , and when one realizes that this tendency had become bluntly visible five years before Lenin 's death , one better understands the famous " testament " Lenin dictated to Krupskaya , his wife , recommending that the party should avoid Stalin 's leadership . And this might well have happened had Stalin been less cunning and forceful . Apart from Lenin himself , Trotsky , Zinoviev , Kamenev , Bukharin , and Rykov were far better liked in the party . But Stalin played a cunning game . First of all he detected in his fellow Georgian , the unspeakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to present Stalin as a self-effacing disciple of Lenin with an unassuming exterior and a simple style of dress . At a stormy Politburo session in 1926 , Trotsky pierced these pretenses and proclaimed : " The first secretary poses his candidature to the post of gravedigger of the revolution , " words Stalin would never forget . Stalin ruthlessly hunted Trotsky out of the country and finally had him murdered in Mexico . Stalin was a hardy little man who , despite the sufferings of his various imprisonments and physical beatings , was fiercely courageous . He impressed his nation and the world by remaining in Moscow while it was almost entirely surrounded by the Nazi Wehrmacht in 1941 ( although it was known to but a handful of people that secret , protected headquarters had been prepared for him in Kuibyshev on the Volga , where the rest of the government and diplomats were evacuated by train ) . Arvo Tuominen , last survivor of Lenin 's Comintern , made this rather paradoxical observation : " I attended many affairs at the Kremlin , even rowdy ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even when he was under the influence of alcohol ; he merely became more garrulous than usual , his voice grew slightly louder and he laughed more readily . " Tuominen , however , reports a Christmas party at the Kremlin where : " As soon as we were seated , Stalin to our surprise clinked his glass for silence , rose and spoke ceremoniously in this manner : Comrades ! I want to propose a toast to our patriarch , life and sun , liberator of nations , architect of socialism , omniscient genius he rattled off all the appelations applied to  | him in those days and great leader of peoples , Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin . And I hope this is the first and last speech made to that genius this evening . ' " The adjectives and phrases selected made many of the guests regard each other briefly askance or peer into their plates . According to Tuominen , Stalin designated a committee to write his biography , but the first draft failed to satisfy the subject because he felt it was insufficiently laudatory . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Stalin fulfilled his task as the leader of the people and the party with consummate skill and enjoyed the unreserved support of the Soviet people , Stalin never allowed the slightest vanity , conceit , or tinge of self-praise to impair his work . " Karel Radek , the brilliant editor and writer , was a fine source for jokes against Stalin , although , until he was purged in 1937 , he was a good party member . He apparently originated the following : Stalin calls in Radek and berates him for derogatory jokes when , after all , he is the adored leader of 200 million Russians . Radek supposedly replies : " That is a joke I did n't originate . " In two separate books , Svetlana Alliluyeva , the dictator 's daughter , showed both love and hate for her detestable father . In Twenty Letters to a Friend , she wrote : " I loved my father more tenderly than I ever had before . . . . Yet even the grandchildren who never saw him loved him ? and love him still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this monster . He " always had a fire in the winter . " He had " a good collection of Russian , ( ; eorgian and Ukrainian folk songs . " He was pleasant to servants : " courteous , unassuming and direct with those who waited on him . " She added : " My father never cared about possessions . He led a puritanical life and the things that belonged to him said very little about him . He lived in one room on the ground floor , in fact , and made it do for everything . He slept on the sofa made up at night as a bed and had telephones on the table beside it .... The garden , the flowers and the woods that surrounded the dacha the vacation house near Sochi , where Stalin moved from the Kremlin after Nadya Alliluyeva 's suicide were my father 's hobby and relaxation . " He had an " enduring love of nature and the soil . " She speculates on the effect of her mother 's suicide and wonders : " Was it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all his own friends ? And even had she summoned up strength to leave my father , whom she loved , her fate would have been even worse , because he would surely have taken his revenge . " Svetlana sounds like an emotional , tender , and very confused woman .  | Though she had several good things to say about her father in her first book , Twenty Letters , she more warmly admired her cultivated , educated mother , who filled the house with air and gaiety , while her father was " just the father of a family , " not a " god " or a " cult . " In those days , they lived in a sunny country house at Zubalovo , outside Moscow where Stalin went daily to work . But there was also an apartment in the Kremlin , where a GermanLatvian ran the household on the ration cards customary to upper Soviet bureaucrats . Svetlana wrote that her home was like that of other people . Stalin went hawk-shooting with a double-barreled rifle or stalked hares at night from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking in the woods , and often carried his little daughter in his arms and called her pet names . Her nurse would tell her : " Bring papa some violets . ' In fact , it was a peculiar and far from tranquil family . After he had driven his wife to suicide at only thirty-one , Stalin had a picture of her in a shawl enlarged and hung in all rooms of his Kremlin apartment . Yet , before her death , he kept quarreling with her . At a spat during a banquet celebrating an anniversary of the October Revolution , he ordered her : " Hey , you . Have a drink ! " Svetlana says she shouted : " Do n't you dare hey ' me , " and ran from the table . That night she reportedly shot herself with a German officer 's pistol . Infuriated by a letter she left reproaching him , he neither attended the funeral nor ever visited her grave . During the ensuing decade he made quite a fuss over Svetlana , although he had little use for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vasily at home and signed their regular school exercise books . Stalin was strict with Nadya 's son , Vasily , but could n't bear his eldest , Ekaterina 's boy , Yakov , whom he considered too Georgian for his increasingly assimilated Russian tastes . He played the affectionate " Little Papa " with Svetlana , to whom he addressed numerous letters : " To my housekeeper , Setanka , " " Hello , Setanka ! " or " I give my little sparrow a big hug . " He occasionally soothed his children by singing in a tuneful , high-pitched voice , but it was always in Russian . Vasily complained to his sister : " You know , Papa used to be a Georgian once . " While Nadya was still alive , the family often spent summer vacations in a dacha near Sochi and the fish hatchery on the Mitchesta River . But after her suicide , state bureaucrats under Beria took charge of the household staff and reported to their boss on who was being received , what was being said . Stalin became increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " named Vlasik on how they should be brought up .   He insisted that Svetlana learn English . He scolded Vasily for his bad marks until the latter turned to the military as a career , studied at the artillery school , and then went to the aviation institute . According to his daughter , Stalin 's increasing submission to Beria started in 1938 . She claims that he was " more treacherous , more practiced in perfidy and cunning , more insolent and single-minded than my father . In a word , he was a stronger character . My father had his weaker sides . " ( This seems hard to believe . ) Before that , Svetlana recalls , Stalin would kiss her goodnight and showed the traditional Georgian tenderness toward his children . He took them to special movie showings in the Kremlin , frequently double bills , and then saw to it they arrived at school on time . He often sent baskets of fruit to Svetlana , signed : " From Setanka-Housekeeper 's wretched secretary , the poor peasant , Stalin . " She writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I shall never forget his affection , his love and tenderness to me as a child . He was rarely as tender to anyone as he was to me . At one time he must have loved my mother very much . And he also loved and respected his mother . " He must have inherited his character from her , too , for there was nothing rough or harsh or fanatical about him . Compare these words with Lenin 's famous testament on Stalin . He was n't brilliant , but he was simple , unassuming , hard-working and capable . He had a quiet charm . " These words are so totally different from those written by others on Stalin , even if the writers obviously did n't know him as well as his daughter , that they flabbergast . And they are just as dumbfounding as many other things Svetlana wrote of her father after she had decided to run away to India , to America , to England . In Only One Year , Svetlana writes : " Knowing my father well , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stemmed from the years of struggle for power with Trotsky and his followers , gradually transforming itself from political hatred to a racial aversion for all Jews bar none . " This seems rather oversimplified . During the winter of 1942 ? 43 Svetlana met and fell in love with Alexei Yakovlevich Kapler , a Jew . She writes : " Because of him my relationship with my father was ruined and was never the same . " Kapler was arrested and Hung into Lubyanka , Moscow 's most dreadful prison . He was charged with contact with foreigners . Having known several foreign correspondents stationed in the U.S.S.R. , he did not deny this . On March 3 , 1943 , Stalin strode into his daughter 's room and demanded all letters Kapler had written her . He seized these to read personally .   Svetlana was still a teenage schoolgirl , and when she returned from her classes was ordered to go to the dining room , where her father was awaiting her . He was furiously tearing up Alexei 's letters and photographs and tossing them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even write decent Russian . " Kapler was sent to a northern concentration camp for five years ' heavy labor . Svetlana continues : " In the spring of 1944 I got married . My first husband , Grigory Morozov , was a student at the Institute of International Relations . I had known him from our schooldays together . He was Jewish and my father did n't like it . However , not wanting to go too far again he somehow accepted the marriage . " Stalin proved as obdurately hard-hearted to the daughter he had loved as a child as he was accustomed to being to others . She and Morozov were given a flat outside the Kremlin on condition that Grigory set no foot there . Stalin never even laid eyes on him . Svetlana then produced her first child , a boy named Iosif . After three years the marriage ended , for personal reasons , and Stalin eased his harshness to the extent of displaying some affection for his grandson . In 1947 he invited Svetlana to Sochi and later sent a note concluding : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th , 1947 . " Two years later Svetlana again married , this time to Yuri Andreyevitch Zhdanov , of whose father her own was a friend . After an illness and one more baby , the marriage to Yuri also collapsed . In 1948 Stalin invited Svetlana , little Iosif , and Yakov 's girl , Gulia , his eldest grandchild , to visit him in the south . On December 21 , 1952 , Svetlana saw her father on his seventy-third birthday ? the last time before she was summoned to his deathbed outside Moscow the following year . That was a cruel , bitter event for a sensitive and emotional young woman . All Stalin 's last cronies were gathered together : Beria , Malenkov , Bulganin , Mikoyan . The dictator 's son , Vasily , by then a hopelessly alcoholic air force general , sprawled there drinking and abusing the doctors . Svetlana is by far the more interesting source on Stalin 's personality and habits . Fear , cruelty , unreality , bullying , strangely sudden appearances and disappearances dotted her entire life until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian , to his homeland and from there finally made her way with great resolve to the West . With her , she brought the manuscript of her Twenty Letters , which was written in a village outside Moscow during 1963 . By then , she had legally changed her name from " Staling " to " Alliluyeva , " after the mother she adored , because " I could no longer tolerate the name of Stalin . " It is difficult to assess Stalin as a human being . Tuominen said , //   " Outward modesty was his masquerade costume " and " Stalin undeniably was a highly gifted and above all a highly energetic man . " He had a slight acquaintance with languages , including Georgian and the Latin and Greek he studied in school . Svetlana says he did n't eat or drink much , but some other writers speak of him in his cups and Djilas was astounded by how much so small a man could eat . He liked getting others drunk ( as do so many Russians ) and he adored practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunting and he liked dogs . He was remarkably strong for so small a man , but as he grew old his blood pressure suffered , he became sclerotic , and the elbow he had injured in childhood bothered him increasingly . He could turn on personal charm effectively but had a hot temper which flared up . On more than one occasion he struck his children . He was more easily fooled than he thought . A great fan of motion pictures , he believed what he saw in Soviet films portraying collective farms with tables groaning under loads of geese and turkeys . He did not travel through the countryside or investigate rural conditions himself . In terms of foreign policy , he made an incredible error . He had considered his 1939 pact with Hitler a triumph because it would turn the Germans and French against each other and he could pick up the pieces after their war . But Hitler fooled him . Stalin paid no attention to detailed warnings from British and other intelligence services saying the Nazis were planning a huge and imminent Blitzkrieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of losing . Stalin was essentially a crafty political manipulator and no philosopher . Despite his parochial schooling , he had no feeling for religion , prayers , or the nonmaterial . Realism , mankind 's struggles , not ideals , were his topics of interest . He had a generally low opinion of humanity 's good points . His formal education was very limited , but he acquired considerable technical knowledge . He also seems to have had a natural genius for military strategy and normally knew when to act on intuition . He was fascinated by and knowledgeable in the essentials and importance of different weapons . But he was ignorant and dogmatic on history , sociology , philosophy . In most respects he was personally a simple man . He could n't count money or evaluate it except in old , prerevolutionary terms . If he gave a present , he had no clue to its real value . He never spent any money , and let his salary accumulate in desk drawers . All his needs ? houses , servants , food , clothing ? were paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own accountancy .   The only real luxury he fancied was good Georgian wine ( despite his preference for Russia and things Russian ) . He kept a wide selection of bottles at hand . He was a callously cruel man but in an almost indifferent way . He seemed to forget that close friends or relatives he had murdered ever existed . One of his most virulent strains of evil was the militant anti-Semitism he encouraged ideologically , especially after World War II . He not only endorsed this credo but propagated it as much as he could . This was not difficult in the Soviet Union , which had old Russian roots for this evil ailment . In a great many respects Stalin was an odd man , a mechanical man . There was neither peace nor happiness hidden away inside him . In Only One Year Svetlana summed up her father : Under no circumstances could one call him a neurotic : rather , powerful , self-control was part of his nature . He was neither hot-tempered , nor open-hearted , nor emotional , nor sentimental ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typically Georgian temperament . Georgians are impulsive , kind , easily shedding tears when moved by compassion or happiness or when enraptured by beauty . Aesthetic feelings , music , poetry , plastic art , play a great role in their lives . But not my father . In him everything was the other way round , and cold calculation , dissimulation , a sober , cynical realism became stronger in him with the years ... . I loved and respected him ? until I grew up . It is possible that in a sense there was an element of a Freudian Oedipus complex in Stalin , despite his metallic soul , although this kind of speculation can easily be misconceived by the amateur . As a girl , Svetlana recalls , " I loved him tenderly , as he loved me . He used to say I was like his mother . That touched him , I think . " In her Twenty Letters she writes : My grandmother had principles of her own . They were'the principles of one who was old and God-fearing , who 'd lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity and honor . Changing her life in any way whatever was the furthest thing from her mind . She passed on all her stubbornness and firmness , her puritanical standards , her unbending , masculine character and   her high requirements for herself to my father . He was much more like her than like his father . In Only One Year Svetlana continues : Any tenderness and love remembered from his childhood days was personified in his mother . But he was so removed from her , both geographically and in spirit , that he knew not how to make his feelings felt by her as something real ; they simply never reached her , getting lost in those vast distances between them .... Everyone to whom he had ever been attached , for whom he had ever felt any affection had been connected in his consciousness with his mother . His first wife bore her name ? Catherine Ekaterina . This quiet , pretty girl had pleased the mother and at the mother 's insistence the marriage had been solemnized in church . Stalin said his mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her mind and not her education , since she was hardly able to write her own name . Svetlana writes : " Sometimes he 'd tell us how she used to spank him when he was little and how she used to hit his father when he drank too much . Apparently she had a strict , decisive character . My father was delighted by that . . . . She was about eighty when she died in 1936 . My father was deeply upset and spoke about her for years afterwards . " Apart from his mother and from his second wife , Nadya Alliluyeva , Stalin 's relations with the rest of the family varied between disagreeable and uninteresting . His father was a ratty , nasty little man who could have been invented by a Russian Charles Dickens . Yakov , the dictator 's eldest son ( by his first wife ) , sounds like an unfortunate if pleasant mediocrity . He spoke with a thick Georgian accent that irked his father , and when he unsuccessfully attempted suicide , Stalin mocked : " Ha ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leningrad to live with his step-relatives , the Alliluyevas , until , during the war , he was taken prisoner by the Germans and killed . There is one story that he deliberately died by flinging himself into an electrified barbed wire fence . But I have also been told the Nazis offered to exchange him for Field Marshal Paulus , the captured commander of the vast Axis army at Stalingrad ; his heartless father , however , dismissed the suggestion in a curt rage . Svetlana 's  | womanly warmth and charm emerge in her writings , but she appears more agreeable than remarkable . By far the most horrible ? worse than his grandfather and instinctually perhaps even worse than his father ? was Vasily , the great air force general . Vasily was obviously a bum and a bully from the start . He started in aviation . At just twenty , in 1941 , he began the war as a captain . He finished it at twenty-four as a lieutenant-general . In 1947 he was transferred from East Germany to Moscow and made air commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incompetent alcoholic who could no longer fly a plane . With Stalin 's approval , he was given a vital command and then seized a dacha , unlawfully , filling it with loot stolen from Europe . His father 's toadies passed up the word that he was very capable , but it soon became widely known that the thirty-year-old general had been destroyed by vodka , and he was dismissed . On April 28 , 1953 , he was arrested for carousing with foreigners and eventually sent to a military hospital . He remained there more than six years . Khrushchev , then boss , summoned him . Vasily was given an apartment and a dacha ; his general 's rank and pension were restored ; and he was reinstated in the Communist Party . However , after being again imprisoned , he was released to a hospital with a liver ailment and died March 19 , 1962 , ruined by alcohol at forty-one . He had led a useless life . As Svetlana was to write : " I do not like vodka , with its concomitant slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and ended up a hopeless alcoholic . " The fact that both Vissarion and his son Iosif were unquestionably brave was not a rare virtue in the domain of the czars , where courage was needed simply to survive . The other traits Stalin inherited from his parent or the latter 's actions had far more psychological importance to his development and therefore to world history . Having suffered in his boyhood , he later used the power he gained to make others suffer likewise . His minions followed instructions and applied torture in the name of dogma , but with a sadistic twist like Torquemada 's inquisitorial brutes in Renaissance Spain . The warped application of Stalinist sternness had deep psychological origins . Robert Tucker concludes : " Since all people in authority over others owing to power or seniority seemed to be like his father , there soon rose in him a vengeful feeling against all people standing above him . From childhood on the realization of his thoughts of revenge became the aim to which everything was subordinated . " Vissarion objected to Ekaterina 's efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of parochial school and train him as a shoemaker . Stalin quit school on his own ? and as Tucker recounts : " The parent with whom he identified positively was his mother . . . . It is evident that he formed a strong mother attachment which greatly influenced the development of his personality . The nature of the influence is suggested by Freud 's remark that a man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror , that confidence of success that often induces real success . ' " Had history of contemporary Russia been written with a Freudian twist rather than a Marxist rigidity , we might well have come up with those grandly simplified assumptions : just as Alexander the Great 's personality , molded by mother-adoration , had been in a position to use his father 's military machine and strategic dreams to launch his own huge conquests , Stalin 's personality , profoundly touched by an Oedipal relationship , was perfectly attuned to the modification of Lenin 's visionary methods and an impressive thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald Kennedy John F. Kennedy , one of the most qualified American presidents when h assumed that office , actually received it almost by right of heritage in republic that thoroughly discourages such pseudo-monarchical procedure His father was not chief of state , nor was he himself an eldest son . Moreover the people of the United States , by specified traditions laid down in the nation 's earliest days , have dutifully elected their leader every four years b popular suffrage , which eventually became universal . But Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. , who fathered nine legitimate children including four sons , was a Celtic clan chief in spirit . What he clearly could not obtain for himself , he decided to pass on to his first boy , Joe , Jr. ? an , that was the key to the White House . But young Joe , a courageous , spirite youth who had yet to display any particular wisdom or political talent , wa cut down cruelly during the war when the bomber he was flying explode under German antiaircraft fire . Joe , Sr. , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the millionaire father told friends : " We 'll sell him lik soap flakes . " He did ? and the nation rapidly discovered the young man wa an eminently salable character . It is only fair to any reader of these pages that I should declare my ow personal bias early in this account . I heartily disliked Joe , Sr. , and new knew young Joe . I much liked and admired Jack , but disliked and mistruste Bobby , the third to die tragically before he had made his true mark o history . As for Teddy , the Benjamin , it is needless to recount a viewpoin he has yet to he embraced by destiny . The tragedy of the Kennedys is that fate arranged for a blemished father and a brave brother to fall by history 's wayside before the faltering torch   political fame was seized by ambitious young Jack only , all too soon , to be extinguished in his blood . President Kennedy was an intelligent , attractive political leader on the road that might well have led to statesmanship . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , contained too much of Father Joe , the tribal leader , to depict the myth it sought to make reality . Joseph P. Kennedy , head of the family that had immigrated two generations earlier , developed a passion for and talent in politics which so many compatriots from Ireland showed once they had grown new roots on the Atlantic 's western shores . I once asked Larry O'Brien , President Kennedy 's election expert , why he thought the Irish , who showed little political skill in their Emerald Isle , managed to develop it so remarkably once they transferred to North America . " That 's obvious , " he said . " America is the land of immigrants . But after the original Anglo-Saxon colonial settlement , we were the first minority to arrive speaking English . Like all minorities , we cared for each other , we were bound together by mutual ties of family and friendship , but when we got here we were able to express ourselves in the majority 's native tongue . " Jack Kennedy could boast descent from politicians on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Honey Fitz " ) Fitzgerald , a popular mayor of Boston and controller of a significant bloc of Massachusetts votes . His own father , Joe , had made himself a passionate politician in his quest for power and prestige to offset what he considered the disadvantages of being a Roman Catholic Irish-American in a country where the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant held significant advantages in social , political , commercial , and financial affairs . Joe 's father , Patrick J. , entered the liquor trade , started a profitable saloon , and branched out into Democratic party politics just as the Irish minority was beginning to assert control over Boston voters . As a result of Patrick 's prosperity , Joe was educated at the nation 's most prestigious public school , Boston Latin , and went on to Harvard , its most prestigious university . There he was bruised by snobbery . It kept him from admission to social clubs he wished to join and conceivably hampered his ambitions to be thought a fine athlete . In response to such slights , Joe decided to seek money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way upward in the layered American society and that money was the key to power . During his life , he showed great talent in amassing a fortune in Wall Street banking , movies , real estate , and liquor marketing . He virtually cornered the American outlet for Scotch   whiskey by getting James Roosevelt as his partner in " Somerset Importers , " when F.D.R. , James 's father , was president . Kennedy moved in to acquire U.S. monopolies as soon as he learned through Washington connections that prohibition was doomed . Joe was an unabashed social climber ever since Harvard . He keenly resented exclusion from high society and relished a sardonic satisfaction as , later on , leaders of the exclusive WASP element began to kowtow to his growing fortune . What he had personally resented in the smug Boston Brahmin attitude toward Irish-Catholics he personally repeated vis-a-vis American Jews ; J. P. Kennedy turned openly anti-semitic , and was later quoted favorably in this respect in Nazi diplomatic dispatches . I came to know Joe when he worked in Washington for Roosevelt as chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission . Also , later , in London as American Ambassador , where he was favorably regarded by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement clique . The better I knew Kennedy , the more I disliked him , despite the fact that he initially treated me with the amiable jollity he reserved for newspapermen expected to do his bidding . Knowing I was acquainted with Roosevelt 's new envoy , a widely circulated American magazine asked me to write a piece on him for a generous sum . I called on the Ambassador . He promised to help in all respects . He introduced me to two principal members of his personal public relations unit , Harvey Klemmer , formerly of the U.S. Maritime Commission , and the well-connected Harold Hinton , formerly of the The New York Times in Washington . Kennedy made himself available for as many conversations as I wished . He only requested the privilege of seeing my completed article ( " to avoid errors " ) . He told me : " I do n't expect to live out the ordinary span of life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , I want to quit public life . I know I 'll die young " which he did n't . I want to establish my older sons firmly enough so they can look after the younger children . " Joe always protested to all but intimates that he had no interest in the Presidency himself . This was baloney . He played all kinds of games , courted all sorts of factional spokesmen , in search of support for just such a crown . He did not fail for a lack of trying but for mistakes he made . I inquired among well-placed Washington friends and then noted in my diary : " Kennedy says he has received approaches suggesting he run for the presidency . Claims he will not run because he loves his family too much . His present job is bad enough for the children without absolutely ruining them . "   An influential member of Roosevelt 's government establishment wrote an analysis for me authorizing publication if I did not mention his name : As for Joe Kennedy , you probably know all about him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually reserved for occupants of the White House or the electric chair . So far , he has evinced no public aspiration for either . However , he has received a great number of letters from Americans announcing they will vote for him if he runs for the presidency in 1940 . He has also been sounded out by certain political sources . He told a friend of mine he would n't dream of taking such a job because it would be too tough on his family . He told me : " I 'm not a good candidate . I 'm no good at getting out and asking the public to vote for me . So far , I 've managed to keep hold of my personal independence and I 've never given the presidency a serious thought . I will go back to business when I finish here ( London ) . The last time I went back to public office ( as chairman of the Maritime Commission ) I did n't go back for glory . " Here is what a friend of his says , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an extremely influential person in Washington : " Joe is intensely interested in public affairs but equally interested in his own power , position , and promotion . Generally speaking , he likes to do a spectacular job and move on as he did with the SEC and , less successfully , with the Maritime Commission . I think he had his eye on a Cabinet post in Commerce or , preferably , in the Treasury . " Neither seemed to be available when he was receptive . Then his mind turned to an ambassadorship . He probably sensed the possibility of war and increasing importance and popular interest in foreign developments . The social prestige of the position probably weighed significantly with him . I think he did feel that the position would mean a great deal to his wife and children . Joe seldom plans to stay in any position long . But I do n't know that he has set any time limit on London . That might depend upon his being asked to take up an equal or higher post here Washington . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a good thing to get out as well as sell out when your stock is riding high . Joe has been written about as a possible candidate   in 1940 ; Joe is too smart to get out on a limb . Yet he is smart enough to seize an opportunity if it comes his way . I am by no means trying to run him down . But I think one must make an emotional rather than an intellectual analysis of Joe . And a psychoanalysis of the greatest of men is likely to find explanation in the simplest emotional forces . " Kennedy feels this analysis is unfounded in many respects . " I never thought about an ambassadorship , " he says , " and this offer came as a complete surprise . I was offered the Secretaryship of Commerce but I did n't want it . The only reason I went back to Washington was to tackle the dirty job of starting off the Maritime Commission and we feel that our report on the situation was a good start . When I 'm through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been working hard and I want to get my sons off right in the world . " Joe Kennedy is known as a loyal Roosevelt man and he is personally fond of the President . However , he criticizes some of the chief executive 's left-wing advisers and certain policies , particularly in the realm of taxes . In England , he has occasionally ventured blunt remarks . He told a group of Oxford students that , if United States bonds went down another 10 percent , every insurance company and bank in the country would go bust . When I wrote my article in 1938 , Kennedy was still popular in England and Chamberlain 's friend . The charm and liveliness of an ambassadorial family with nine children captured the English imagination . Only after disaster struck in 1940 , with the fall of France and the naming of Churchill 's war cabinet , did the British intelligence services report to the new prime minister that their taps of Kennedy 's personal and official communications had showed him much more appeasement-minded than Chamberlain . The Churchill government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social lion ( a role he relished ) , was suddenly isolated ; hostesses abruptly ceased inviting him . His sources of official information withered . But none of this had yet happened when I finished my work . I showed the piece to the ambassador as I had promised . He was furious with what he read . I refused to change it despite his blandishments and threats . He then said : " You know , that magazine 's publisher is my close friend . I 'll see to it your piece is never printed . " I stood by my statements and mailed the manuscript home . Weeks later , when I was in Prague , Czechoslovakia 's capital , the proofs were forwarded .  | The piece had been so altered it seemed as if the ambassador himself had written it . All reference to his political views or aspirations was gone . I wired my editor ; no luck , so much time had elapsed that the article was already in print . I first met Joe 's second son , John Fitzgerald , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from London on a trip to familiarize himself with eastern Europe while still a Harvard undergraduate . The American minister to Jugoslavia , to whose care Ambassador Kennedy had confided Jack , asked me if I 'd look after him because I knew Belgrade well and was much nearer his age . He was a nice , friendly , inquiring kid , skinny , intelligent , and eager . After a couple of evenings together , he somewhat timidly asked whether I 'd mind if he called me " Cy . " Little did I suspect I was getting on cozy terms with a future president . Thus , just before the outbreak of World War II , I had the fortune to wind up an acquaintanceship with Joseph P. Kennedy and to begin one with his second son , both significant figures in mid-twentieth-century America . Fortunately , the latter was more significant . Jack was a man of quality , even though the legend he bequeathed was more mythical than real . The father 's cardinal rule in bringing up his clan of nine children was : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second or third ? that does n't count ; but win , win , win . " Joe 's example served as a symbol of success in all but national politics . Roosevelt used him ( and his money ) , but dumped him before he became too much of an embarrassment . He had already made a fortune and succeeded triumphantly in his social climbing . In America , money is far from being the root of all evil . The clan chief taught Jack , his most brilliant pupil , that money could purchase talent . Arthur Krock , the journalist , helped to expand the youth 's Harvard thesis on Britain 's faulty policy before the war into a well-edited book called While England Slept . This succeeded handsomely , assisted by lavish ambassadorial spending on promotion and advertising . Later Jack was to gain a Pulitzer prize of questionable merit ( because the work was so substantially ghost-written by his aide , Ted Sorensen ) for another volume entitled Profiles in Courage . He also earned a reputation as a splendid and effective orator , although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent and liberal Democrat who supported Stevenson but served Kennedy 's administration faithfully as under secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations , wrote in his memoirs :   If it is now part of the mythology that he was a gifted speaker , that is only by contrast to those whom we have since endured . He spoke with a peculiar Bostonian cadence , letting his voice fall just when it should have risen to gain maximum effect . An attractive figure on the platform , easy in manner , armed with eloquently phrased speeches interlarded with questions and poetry , he projected charm but little passion . Though audiences liked him and found him disarming , they were rarely roused as Roosevelt , for example , had roused them . . . . He could not impose his own personality on the events of the day as I had seen Roosevelt do three decades earlier . Young Jack was helped along by his durable bravery in his successful pursuit of the prize glimpsed by his determined father . This was not simply the bravery he displayed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enduring courage of one who suffered excruciating pains from a desperately bad back , further inflamed by athletic and war injuries , and by Addison 's disease and other achingly disquieting maladies . ( Addison 's disease is an adrenal disorder which causes weakness , loss of weight , tnd subjects a victim to easy infection . ) An ordinary man under no pressures would have spent at least half his time on crutches . Young Kennedy used them sparingly . He drove himself to lead a more-than-normal life interlarded with sports ( at which he had some talent ) , and the steadiest flow of ladies since Warren G. Harding 's day passed through the White House . Jack 's , however , were more attractive . Nevertheless , a few who slipped in had unsavory contacts with shady characters or criminals , including a mafia boss . He brought with him to the nation 's highest office some heavy baggage passed on by his father 's prejudices : a brooding concern about gold reserves and a connection with Joe McCarthy , whom he had befriended when in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bobby worked for him until he cast off that besmudged totem to wrap himself in the liberal shroud of Adlai Stevenson . Jack explained he found it difficult to berate McCarthy while his brother worked for him . Yet John F. Kennedy was not wholly swaddled by his father 's prejudices . He had a quick intelligence and could speed-read 1,200 words a minute . 1 le was a pragmatist and avoided Joe 's rabid isolationism , as indeed he had done since his Harvard days . There was nothing pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic in his makeup . Also he clearly held the English in great esteem ,  | which his father only pretended to do early during his London mission . As Ball was to write : " The father 's noxious views had not infected the son . " It is difficult for outsiders to appreciate the force of Joseph P. Kennedy : bitter , ambitious , charming , ruthless , and disappointed . As head of the family , he was tyrannical . During August 1962 I spent a few days with Jackie ; her sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italy . I was struck one day , while Jackie and I passed hours stretched out chatting on the deck of a handsome yacht , to hear her refer to her father-in-law , whenever she mentioned him , as " Mr. Kennedy . " She spoke of the president and the attorney general of the United States as " Jack " and " Bobby . " There is no doubt that Joseph P. had a profound influence on each of his children . Yet a friend of Jack said : " When he spoke I could hear his mother 's voice . She 's the one who put the family spirit in them . " Rose spent much time mothering her brood , reading , shopping , sightseeing , and seeing to their religious life . The father was tough and blunt , intent on climbing psychological ladders , principally his own ; apart from winning a game , he had no interest in it or the rules of fair play . At first Joe 's crude charm worked well in Chamberlain 's England . His anti-Semitism and isolationism hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a round of golf helped greatly . Yet Harold Ickes , Roosevelt 's curmudgeonly interior secretary , wrote : " At a time when we should be sending the best we have to Great Britain we have not done so . We have sent a rich man , untrained in diplomacy , unlearned in history and politics , who is a great publicity-seeker and who is apparently ambitious to be the first Catholic President of the United States . " Joe is quoted as having told Harvey Klemmer : " Roosevelt and the kikes are taking us into war . " When Churchill finally took office in 1940 , he sent William Stephenson to establish headquarters in New York for Britain 's secret intelligence service . Stephenson reported on Kennedy 's pessimistic views concerning Britain 's chance of staving off defeat . Kennedy was in close contact with the America First Committee and congressional isolationists , just as he later cottoned to Senator McCarthy . " I always liked him , " he said of the evil , alcoholic legislator . " He was a pleasant fellow . " Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy . Not only did this spell eventual defeat for Hitler , although the envoy was telling Roosevelt : " Only a miracle can save the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk from being wiped out , or , as I said yesterday , surrender . " It put a finis to Joe , Sr. 's inclinations to personal power , anti-Semitism , and  | isolationism in world affairs . ( He even blamed Roosevelt for the death of his eldest son . Truman later quoted Joe Kennedy as referring to : " That crippled son of a bitch that killed my son Joe . " ) Fed by Stephenson and astute British snooping , the Foreign Office opened a file on the American envoy called " Kennedyana . " Among entries included was this : " Mr. Kennedy is a very foul specimen of double crosser and defeatist . He thinks of nothing but his own pocket . I hope that this war will at least see the elimination of this type . " The foreign secretary , Lord Halifax , initialed this opinion . On January 15 , 1960 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph Churchill twice ? for lunch and again in the evening . He had the following story about Joe Kennedy , Jack 's father ? and he swears he can confirm its truth : In 1933 , Jimmy Roosevelt came over to London just before the inauguration of President Roosevelt , together with his friend Joe Kennedy ( who paid for the expedition ) . Randolph took them to his father 's for lunch , little knowing what the purpose was . He soon found out . They explained that Kennedy had gotten in touch with all the biggest whiskey distillers , told them he had given $50,000 to Roosevelt 's campaign ( before the convention ) , and was in the middle of things . He could assure them Prohibition would shortly end and he wished to line up contracts to represent the best firms . He got a fistful . The next time Randolph laid eyes on Kennedy was after he came over as ambassador in 1936 , to represent Roosevelt at the Court of St. James 's . Word was passed around ( before his arrival ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was invited to house parties , dinners , golf and shooting by dukes and earls . However , war came , and it soon became apparent that Kennedy thought England was dilapidated and done for ; he indicated a private personal preference for the Germans . This became known and the government quietly told the establishment it was no longer necessary to be nice . Suddenly Kennedy found himself isolated and alone . In 1940 , Clare Luce came over to stay with him . The Luces were busily organizing a campaign to prevent Roosevelt from getting a third term.They secretly arranged with Kennedy , who
