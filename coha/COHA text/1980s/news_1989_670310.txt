NEW YORK  --  Stocks slumped after four days of gains , as a spurt of early-year institutional buying showed signs of drying up . After closing the previous three days at its highest levels since the October 1987 crash , the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6. 25 to 2193. 21 . Volume on the New York Stock Exchange contracted to 140 , 420 , 000 shares from 163 , 180 , 000 on Monday . Even the resignation of Wall Street ' s top cop didn ' t help the market . Just after 10 a. m . EST , news came that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New York , the most famous prosecutor in Wall Street history , had stepped down . Stocks fell , probably coincidentally . Mr. Giuliani had been the source of whispering , wisecracks and trepidation among traders during his five-year tenure , in which he headed the criminal cases against Dennis Levine , Ivan Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert . " Some on Wall Street may view it favorably that the pressure ' s off , " said Philip Puccio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I don ' t think that ' s the case . He made his point and now he can pass the ball off to his lieutenants . " Others noted that lower-profile Wall Street investigators such as Gary Lynch , the Securities and Exchange Commission ' s enforcement chief , are still on the job . David Holt , director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities , Los Angeles , said he viewed the session as " a catch-your-breath day " for stocks following their four-session upswing . That streak was the market ' s longest broad-based advance in more than six months ; just before Thanksgiving , the Dow Jones industrials had risen five consecutive times , but other averages didn ' t follow suit . Yesterday all the market barometers fell . Standard &; Poor ' s 500-stock index eased 0. 60 to 280. 38 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 0. 50 to 263. 14 and the New York Stock Exchange composite declined 0. 30 to 157. 85 . Metals stocks generally fared best ; their gains were paced by aluminum issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing tight supplies . Reynolds Metals went up 1 3/8 to 57 , Aluminum Co. of America rose 1/2 to 58 5/8 , Amax gained 3/4 to 24 3/8 and Asarco added 1/4 to 28 . American Barrick Resources outshone other precious-metals issues , rising 1 5/8 to 18 1/4 in response to its plans to spend $365 million over the next three years to boost gold output at its Goldstrike mine in Nevada . Meanwhile , Timberland was the most active declining stock . It fell 3 7/8 to 11 5/8 on 409 , 200 shares  --  18 times its average daily volume  --  in American Stock Exchange trading , after the footwear and apparel company said fourth-quarter sales and earnings were well below earlier projections . Some traders said the market was spooked by fears of a temporary oversupply of stock caused by a major sell program begun Monday by Goldman Sachs ; the firm sold Renaissance Investment Management ' s entire portfolio of blue-chip stocks . Late yesterday , however , Renaissance said its sold-off portfolio included $1. 7 billion of blue-chip stocks , a bit less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Dow Jones industrials once again vaulted the 2200 level  --  a psychological and technical barrier that has become the bulls ' obsession . However , a number of computer-assisted " sell " programs hit the market about a half-hour after the opening and stocks didn ' t regain their opening levels . But program trading was credited with helping the market shave its losses in half later in the day . After the Dow had drifted about 12 points lower by mid-afternoon , buy programs came in to lift blue-chip stocks , traders said . Jay Hohmann , head futures trader at Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , explained that the March Standard &; Poor ' s 500 futures contract rose past an important price level in early afternoon  --  a rise that triggered additional buying of the contract and thus widened the spread between the futures price and the S &; index itself . When this spread widens enough , index arbitragers sell the futures and buy the relatively " underpriced " stocks , sending the Dow up quickly . Big Board decliners outnumbered gainers , 816 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &; Co. told the SEC that financing for the $25 billion buy-out " is proceeding as well as or better than expected . " The stock was the Big Board ' s most active , with 3. 2 million shares traded . Bankers say the first deadline last Friday for banks to sign up for the deal ' s $14 billion in bank financing netted $10. 5 billion to $11 billion in commitments . RJR stock has risen more than four points since major Japanese banks were reported late last week to have committed more than $5 billion . Procter &; Gamble rose 1 1/2 to 88 5/8 amid speculation about the company ' s plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 80 cents a share from 70 cents , which it announced after the close . But blue-chip stocks generally lost ground . International Business Machines slid 7/8 to 121 1/8 , General Motors dropped 1/2 to 85 5/8 , Westinghouse Electric fell 5/8 to 52 7/8 , Du Pont dropped 1 1/4 to 89 5/8 and Coca-Cola Co. eased 1/2 to 44 1/2 .
