A tacky mural of the Lower Manhattan skyline served as backdrop . The band 's version of Theme from New York , New York compensated in decibels for what it lacked in finesse . The ballroom of the thoroughly lived-in Omni Park Central Hotel was too small and too warm for the hundreds crammed together like rush- hour commuters on the A train . But the atmospherics last Tuesday night mattered not at all . Chants of " Duke ! Duke ! Duke ! " alternated with cries of " Let 's go , Mike ! " And when Michael Dukakis paused before speaking , his usually constricted smile was as broad and welcoming as New York harbor . Campaign workers cheered ecstatically at the Duke 's every prosaic line . " I love New York ! " brought hurrahs . " Friends , if we can make it here , we can make it anywhere . " Delirious applause . <P> For once , primary-night hoopla matched reality . After a week of bogus suspense in which it appeared that Jesse Jackson 's insurgent tide might carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 51% to Jackson 's 37% and only 10% for Al Gore . The victory ended any hope Jackson had of fighting Dukakis to a draw  --  an outcome that would have produced chaos at the Democratic Convention in Atlanta . Though Jackson , after a period of uncertain silence , insisted he could still win the nomination , Campaign Manager Gerald Austin conceded that his patron 's prospects had turned " pretty bleak . " Even before the votes were counted , Jackson was retreating to claims of symbolic victory ; then a few of his advisers talked publicly about seeking the vice-presidential nomination . <P> Gore 's latest failure proved terminal : he suspended campaigning Thursday , though he will attempt to hold his delegates together by remaining a nominal candidate . Gore was a star of Super Tuesday just six weeks earlier , but his erratic performance since then seemed to eliminate him even from the roster of vice-presidential prospects . <P> Dukakis ' breakthrough is the sum of math and momentum . New York was the last chance before the June 7 California primary to spike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,070 delegates of the 2,081 needed to nominate . Despite the quirky tendency of Democratic voters to turn against front runners , Dukakis appears assured of capturing at least two-thirds of the 1,000 delegates still to be elected . A majority of the 643 super-delegates  --  public and party officials who are nominally unpledged  --  are also known to favor Dukakis . These recruits , together with scores of delegates now uncommitted or hooked to defunct candidates , will provide the critical mass necessary to settle the issue . <P> Dukakis , the plodding survivor , the paradigm of caution who has launched not a single imaginative political theme , has outlasted seven rivals . Barring acts of God , this candidate described by one of his own aides as an " earnest nerd " will be the nominee . Sighs of relief were audible among much of the Democratic establishment . Because Dukakis evokes wild enthusiasm ? Hardly . A TIME poll last week conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman showed that only 34% of registered voters consider Dukakis an " exciting " candidate ( vs. 66% for Jackson ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest that combined the worst elements of burlesque and trench warfare . Now at last the stable , competent craftsman can begin to build a campaign against George Bush .
