BANJARMASIN , Indonesia  --  The timber industry , one of Indonesia ' s chief foreign-exchange earners , is in deep disarray . Four years ago the government began phasing out the export of whole logs from Indonesia . It also forced sawmills to build plants to make plywood , which earns more than unprocessed logs in foreign markets . By next year , hardwood log exports will be banned completely . At the same time , the government has stopped granting new logging concessions to slow down the depletion of Indonesia ' s forests . But industry leaders contend that government attempts to restructure the industry have backfired . Exact figures aren ' t available , but industry sources and government officials agree that log production has dropped 25% since 1980 . And , though the resulting scarcity has pushed up domestic log prices substantially , foreign-exchange earnings from timber exports in 1982 , the latest year for which statistics are available , were down 44% from 1978 to $558 million , according to the International Monetary Fund . Many foreign logging companies have pulled out of Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s sawmills and plywood manufacturers are threatened with bankruptcy . More than 50 , 000 industry workers have lost their jobs , union officials say . The government doesn ' t have overall job figures for the industry . Besides the closures and layoffs , Indonesia , which only six years ago was the world ' s top producer of tropical hardwood logs , must import logs to keep some of its mills and manufacturers operating . Even though Indonesia isn ' t any longer the world ' s leading hardwood log producer , it remains the largest producer of wood products . The province of South Kalimantan on the island of Borneo has been particularly hard hit . Industry sources say 64 of the province ' s 71 sawmills are on the verge of bankruptcy because they can ' t obtain enough logs to saw to pay their operating costs . Many have ceased production . The situation is similarly harsh in East , West and Central Kalimantan . The government is sticking to its guns . Industry observers say that , under the policy of promoting plywood exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the industry and government don ' t have statistics on how much . They expect Indonesia to become the top plywood supplier in Asia , if not the world , by the end of the decade . But sources in the industry say the move is costing Indonesia dearly . Dozens of foreign logging companies , such as Weyerhauser Co. and Georgia-Pacific Corp. , both of the U.S. , have pulled out of Indonesia rather than sink millions of dollars into plywood plants . Weyerhauser and Georgia-Pacific operations have been taken over by their Indonesian partners , and the other foreign companies have been replaced by scores of new plywood manufacturers that are competing for a dwindling supply of logs . The few sawmills that continue to operate , however , are those with their own logging concessions . Government officials concede that many small mills are being forced out of business , but they say in the long run the restructuring will prove to be in the best interest of the industry and the country . And while big plywood manufacturers with their own logging concessions say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own source of logs say they are operating at a loss . They say the scarcity and inflated costs of logs , plus the low world price of plywood , makes it difficult for them to stay in business .
