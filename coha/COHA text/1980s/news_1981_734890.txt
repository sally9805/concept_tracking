txt food stamps . But most of these changes are intended only to make these programs fairer and more rational . The idea is to count all forms of income in determining eligibility and benefits and . to ensure that households at the same income level get the same amount of help . For AFDC , the income of a. child 's stepparent would be counted as income , as would the money provided through the Earned Income Tax Credit . As it is , a family with 65,000 in income from wages gets less help than a family in which the parent and the step-parent each earn $2.500. even though their disposable incomes are the same . The same effort to rationalize is behind the Proposal to count free school lunches in calculating food stamp benefits . The point is not to punish people who take advantage of federal aid programs , but only to make sure that people of like resources receive like treatment . But there is considerable room for disagreement about how to reduce the cost of these programs . In the food stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income for a family of four from $14,000 to $11.000 . This would reduce costs , but it would also discourage someone with an income of $11.000 from trying to improve his position . The cardinal virtue of the current food stamp program is that it guarantees that anyone who earns an extra dollar of income will not be worse off as a result . This is because benefits are phased out gradually as income rises . By phasing them out abruptly at the $11.000 level , Mr. Reagan will make it more costly for some recipients to work than not to work . Similarly , in the case of AFDC , Mr. Reagan must find a way to make sure that counting step-parents ' income will not discourage stable , two-parent households . lie and his supply-side advisers have made much of how sensitive the behavior of the rich is to changes in marginal tax rates . But they seem to assume that steep marginal tax rates on the working poor will not affect their behavior . Mr. Reagan 's proposals also contain some hefty concessions to various powerful interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he has not been bold enough . His cuts in synthetic fuel subsidies affect only a few projects financed by the Energy Department , leaving untouched that $88 billion monstrosity , the Synthetic Fuels Corporation . Though he reduced dairy price supports . he ignored the $3 billion which will be paid to other farmers in price support programs , deficiency payments , and assorted low-interest loans . He passed up the chance to save $3.8 billion in Social Security benefits by tying cost-of-living raises to actual increases in the wages of current workers . And he refused to tamper with any of the largess provided through veterans ' programs and Medicare . These are conspicuous omissions in a budget that is supposed to make everyone sacrifice . But to complain that some of the programs left intact do n't meet Mr. Reagan 's min standards is to acknowl-edge lust how thorough and tough-minded his administration has been in preparing its spending proposals . : Vs more details emerge . we may find more disagreements . But for now . Mr. Reagan e deserves credit for breaking all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , d Washington may never be the same .
