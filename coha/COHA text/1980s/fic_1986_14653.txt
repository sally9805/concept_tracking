This should all be played real dopey . Enter SMILE , the narrator , in a swallowtail coat and top bat , and an enormous fixed smile that never leaves his face . SMILE Once upon a very long time ago , in a far distant fairytale kingdom in the tiny village of , oh , say , Placeville , there lived a family of jolly bakers . ( Lights up on family group : FATHER , MOTHER , CLARENCE , and CHATTER , a dog ) SMILE There was the jolly father , Mr. Baker FATHER BAKER Pie , bread , cookies , cake , These are the things I like to bake . SMILE His jolly , good-hearted , but somewhat impractical wife , Mrs. Baker MOTHER BAKER The Smiths ordered two loaves of pumpernickel bread , but I threw in a dozen chocolate chip cookies for free because they love them so much and even though we may end up losing money , still , just think how happy the Smiths will be . FATHER BAKER You 're so impractical , dear . MOTHER BAKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatter the dog , who could do something most dogs can't. p. 3 CHATTER ( Digging ) : I could have sworn I buried that bone right here in the front yard ! SMILE He could talk ! CHATTER Or was it the backyard ? Or under the willow by the river ? SMILE But he had a terrible terrible memory . CHATTER ( To SMILE ) : I can talk , ca n't I ? Give a dog a break . SMILE And last , but most important of all , was their son Clarence , who until recently had been a very ordinary little boy , until he discovered that he had a very extraordinary talent . CLARENCE ( Imitating SMILE ) : " Once upon a very long time ago , in the tiny village of , oh , say , Placeville " SMILE He could imitate anyone he met perfectly . CLARENCE " Perfectly . " SMILE Is n't that adorable ? FATHER BAKER You be careful who you make fun of , boy . Not everyone likes to see themselves in a comical light . CLARENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just enjoy seeing people laugh . SMILE Every year , the ruler of the kingdom , the orphaned regent Sad Princess Gladys , would wander from the royal palace for one entire month . ( PRINCESS GLADYS crosses stage singing the first phrase of " Stormy Weather " ) Where she went no one knew , but when she returned , she held a royal feast and each village in the kingdom sent to her table the one dish they made best . For one 's village to send one 's dish was a great , great honor . p. 4 FATHER BAKER Mother , Clarence , Chatter , guess who 's coming to pay us a visit tomorrow ? The Mayor , the Minister , and the Magistrate . MOTHER BAKER The Three Big M 's of Placeville ? But , dear , they would only visit us at this time of year if FATHER BAKER That 's right ! They have agreed to sample our pastries and consider them for the official entry of Placeville at the royal feast of Sad Princess Gladys . If chosen we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Princess will allow us to grovel at her feet , word will spread , our pastry will become famous throughout the land , we 'll open a chain of stores McBaker 's ! Invest in real estate . Diversify . We 'll be rich , rich , rich ! CHATTER I 'm so excited I could bark , if I remembered how ! ( FAMILY sets up table of pastries ) SMILE So all that night the Bakers baked in preparation for their important visitors , and while the town slept peacefully , the dark air filled with savory odors from the Bakers ' chimney : jam tarts and quince tarts and rhubarb pie and veal pie and chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies and blue-berry muffins and egg bread and sesame rolls and strawberry flans and cinnamon doughnuts and honey popovers and cannoli . No , wait , not cannoli . I 'm getting carried away . I just happen to love cannoli . Have you ever tasted it with espresso cof  --  ( Stops ) Never mind . The next morning , when all was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATHER BAKER Now , Clarence , remember , we must do everything in our power to please the Three Big M 's of Placeville , so be polite at all times , speak only when spoken to , and , above all , none of your infernal imitations . The punch , Mother explain . MOTHER BAKER There are two bowls of punch . The one at this end of the table has in it a little something to make our honored guests feel pleasant and look kindly upon our baked goods . The one at this end is plain old punch . Children and dogs drink from this one . The rest of us from the other . CLARENCE Yes , Mother . MOTHER BAKER Chatter ? CHATTER Under the shed ! That 's where I buried it . What ? Oh , yes , I understand . SMILE And with that , the guests arrived . ( Enter MAYOR , MINISTER , and MAGISTRATE , all very self-important ) FATHER BAKER Mr. Mayor , Mr. Minister , Mr. Magistrate , what an honor to have you with us today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : And what a delectable array of the baker 's art you have endeavored to present before us on this hallowed day of sampling and decision . The smell alone arouses within my person elements of compliment which I would hasten to utter if time and circumstances were of a more flexible aspect , but that being not the case , let us eschew becoming lost in the byways of preamble , and to the tasting ! p. 6 MOTHER BAKER Chatter , some punch for the guests . ( CHATTER obeys , putting punch in cups and passing them out ) FATHER BAKER And how do you enjoy the pineapple upside-down cake , Mr. Minister ? MINISTER F-f-f-f-first rate , I m-m-m-must say . MOTHER BAKER Mr. Magistrate , those are the chocolate clairs , one of our specialties . MAGISTRATE Are they not topped with chocolate ? This is visible . Have they not the oblong shape of clairs ? This is patent . So , altogether , are they not chocolate clairs ? Of this I 'm aware . CHATTER ( With two cups ) : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for the Mayor . No , wait . This one right paw , left paw . Which paw do you eat your soup with ? Oh ! I remember now . This one 's yours . CLARENCE ( Drinking ) : Are n't they silly , Chatter . I bet if they could see themselves , they 'd howl with laughter . CHATTER Remember what your father said , Clarence . CLARENCE I know , I know . CHATTER What did he say ? There was something you should n't do . Or was it should ? p. 7 MAYOR Mr. and Mrs. Baker , may I just say that even having concluded a mere fraction of the available sampling here before us , I find myself vigorously propelled towards a favorable reception vis -- vis the fruits of your artistry , if I may put it that way . MAGISTRATE Is the flavor not superior ? This has been experienced . Might our town take pride in such an entry ? This is possible . MINISTER **43;3516;TOOLONG . FATHER BAKER Well , Mother , what do you say to that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( ALL laugh politely ) FATHER BAKER Clarence , would you like to thank our guests ? CLARENCE ( Looking woozy ) : Th-th-th-th-thank you o-o-o-one and all . MINISTER ( Pleased ) : It 's n-n-n-nothing , my b-b-b- . What did he just s-s-s-s-say ? MOTHER BAKER Clarence ! CHATTER ( To himself ) : Left paw , right paw . Uh-oh . MAGISTRATE Was your son not mocking the Minister ? This is suggested . p. 8 CLARENCE And is the suggestion not amusing ? It is . Are we not on the verge of laughter ? We should be . FATHER BAKER Not another word , Clarence . Go directly to your room . MAYOR Am I receiving the impression that your son 's behavioral peculiarity contains within it elements of imitation which could be taken to reflect upon certain members of the company present in the area of this room today ? CLARENCE The behavioral aspects in question contain within their limits only a desire to illustrate to the collected population within the purviews of the area under our roof a certain humorous impression MINISTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making f-f-f-fun of yourself . MAGISTRATE Is my temper not rising at this display ? This is tangible . Am I not about to explode with anger ? This is imminent . CLARENCE Do you not always answer your own questions ? This we 've observed . FATHER BAKER To your room ! CLARENCE Is anyone interested in what you have to say ? This is doubtful . MAYOR How dare you ! Take that ! ( Hits CLARENCE ) And that . ( Hits him again ) And that and that and that . ( THE THREE BIG M 'S pounce on CLARENCE and beat him ) p. 9 MOTHER BAKER Stop , you bullies , he 's only a little boy ! FATHER BAKER Perhaps now he 'll know better than to disobey his father ! MOTHER BAKER Chatter , do something to frighten them off . Bark . Growl . Be menacing . CHATTER ( Pronouncing the words ) : Arf . Arf . Grrr . Grrr . Bark . Rolf . Woof-woof . Something 's lacking . ( The beating stops ) MAYOR Needless to articulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village at the royal feast , this year or ever ! MINISTER P-p-p-p-astries be damned . MAGISTRATE Are we not leaving in a huff ? We are ! ( THE THREE BIG M 's exit in a buff ) MOTHER BAKER Oh , Clarence , darling , are you all right ? CLARENCE Why did they do that , Mother ? I thought they 'd find it funny . FATHER BAKER They 're laughing , all right . And guess who 's the joke ? No meeting with Sad Princess Gladys . No McBaker 's . All our dreams in ruins . Tomorrow you will come with me and apologize to the Three Big Ms of Placeville . We will humble our-selves before them and beg to have our pastry reconsidered ! p. 10 CLARENCE How can I apologize when I did nothing wrong ? FATHER BAKER Are you contradicting me , young man ? MOTHER BAKER Do n't be so hard on him , dear . He only meant to amuse . FATHER BAKER I 'm locking you in your room until you agree to come with me and apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMILE And so , that night , Clarence was locked up alone in his room , while Chatter sat outside the door listening to his beloved friend 's sighs . Oh , dear , this part 's so sad , I can barely bring myself to watch . ( CHATTER and CLARENCE on opposite sides of make-believe door ) CHATTER How ya doin ' , Clar ? CLARENCE Sigh . CHATTER Oh , boy . My screw-up . There I was , one of each punch in separate cups , and then I remembered it 's under the bench in the town square , that 's where I buried my bone . And everything else went clean out of my head . ( Pauses ) Clar , talk to me . ( Pauses ) God , when you did the Mayor I was so near laughing out loud I nearly had to run and find a tree to pee on . Do him again , I really get a kick out of that one . Clar ? p. 11 CLARENCE ( After a pause , trying ) : I I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHATTER The Magistrate , he 's easy , I can almost handle that one myself . CLARENCE ( After a pause ) : It 's no use , Chatter . I try and try , but all I remember is their angry faces and how they beat me , and nothing comes out . CHATTER Bad attitude , Clar . CLARENCE Well , what else am I to think ? CHATTER Try this on for size . " Where there 's life , there 's hope . " And how about " Every cloud has a silver lining . " ( Pauses ) Darn , there 's another one it 's right on the tip of my tongue . " Go for it , " that 's the one . CLARENCE Go for what ? CHATTER Your talent . We 'll venture forth to search for where it went , and we 'll have some adventures , and then we 'll find it and we can all live happily ever after . CLARENCE You 're right , Chatter ! Why did n't I think of that ? But first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to me. p. 12 SMILE And so Chatter , using skills he 'd acquired here and there , picked the lock on Clarence 's bedroom door , and that night two figures could be seen slipping across the shadows of the village square , out past the fields of the surrounding farms , across the river and into the dark dark forest beyond . After what seemed like hours , it dawned on them that they were lost . CLARENCE Chatter , where are we ? CHATTER Well , I 'm over here and you 're over there . After that it 's anyone 's guess . SMILE Now comes the scary bit . I love to be frightened . Like when someone sneaks up behind you and goes " Boo ! " Is n't that great ? Anyway , all around them , the frightened pair heard strange noises from the depths of the dark dark forest . ( Strange animal noises ) CLARENCE Boy , Chatter , there 's sure some spooky noises in the forest . CHATTER That 's not the only spooky thing , Clar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever it is , there 's two of them . A pair of spooky things . ( Enter TWO FROGS , a MALE-M.F. - and a FEMALE-F.F. - bopping ) p. 13 BOTH FROGS Ribbit-ribbit . Ribbit-ribbit . CLARENCE They sound like frogs . CHATTER They sound like big frogs . CLARENCE Try talking to them . CHATTER Clarence , frogs do n't talk . CLARENCE Neither do dogs . CHATTER Good point , good point . Hey , you two . You two frogs ! What 's the deal here ? FEMALE FROG We are enchanted frogs . CHATTER Enchanted frogs , God , what an image . FEMALE FROG You 're here because you think you 've lost your talent , Clarence . But it is n't true . All you have lost is the courage to use it . You must find your courage , and once you 've found it , you must never again let it go , no matter how angry it may make people . CLARENCE But where shall I look ? FEMALE FROG We 're coming to that , take it easy . MALE FROG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kingdom can help you , Clarence , and that is the orphaned regent Sad Princess Gladys . Seek her out , discover what makes her sad , then find a way to bring a smile to her face , for it is written that he who makes the princess smile shall one day be king . p. 14 MALE FROG And being a king is a very big deal . If that does n't restore your courage , forget it . CLARENCE But this is the month the princess disappears , to whence no one knows . How shall I ever find her ? FEMALE FROG You must undergo the following trial . Do exactly as we say and no harm shall come to you . But one mistake and , poof , you 'll both be turned to Dacron . MALE FROG Rock , darling . They 'll be turned to rock . FEMALE FROG Whatever . First , you must walk straight ahead in the direction we point , and for three days and three nights you may not stop , nor may you look to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third day FEMALE FROG And no food . You ca n't eat anything . MALE FROG That 's right . Then , on day three , a great rain will fall , and before a single droplet can touch you , you must say the words " Gladys , where art thou and what makes thee so sad ? " Whereupon you will become tiny enough to walk between the raindrops , and this is very important FEMALE FROG because if you are wet when you reach the Mighty Oak of Oaks , you will be turned instantly into mohair. p. 15 MALE FROG Rock , dear . FEMALE FROG You tell it your way , I 'll tell it mine . Have you both understood ? CLARENCE Are you getting all this , Chatter ? CHATTER You lost me at the raindrops . MALE FROG At the Mighty Oak of Oaks , you will find lying nearby a stick in the shape of a Y. This you must beat against the tree . The rain will stop instantly , a bolt of lightning will strike the oak and render it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds awfully complicated . FEMALE FROG You want to know if there 's a shortcut , sonny ? Of course there 's a shortcut , there 's always a shortcut . CLARENCE Perhaps you could tell us what it is . MALE FROG If we had wanted to do that , we 'd have told you in the first place . We 're enchanted frogs . We call the shots . FEMALE FROG You want to do it your way , go ahead , see what happens , but do n't expect any help from us . And remember , one wrong move , hello mohair . MALE FROG Ribbit-ribbit . ( BOTH FROGS exit ) CLARENCE No , wait p. 16 SMILE As the enchanted frogs leapt away , Clarence realized with growing horror what a desperate situation they were in . CLARENCE Oh , Chatter , now what do we do ? One wrong move and we 'll be fabric . CHATTER Let me think . I 've been in this situation before . CLARENCE You have ? CHATTER Oh , you know , other fairy tales . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in other fairy tales ? CHATTER Did you think I was a one-tale dog ? The thing is , there was always a way out . SMILE Whereupon Chatter , barely knowing why , but over-whelmed with a certainty that he was very close to the bone , set to digging with a frenzy . ( CHATTER digs with a fury ) CHATTER Oh , yes , that smell , that smell . A nice , juicy tibia . And with bits of meat still clinging to the ends , if memory serves . ( Finds something ) I 've got something . This is n't a bone . CLARENCE It 's a diamond , Chatter . It 's the largest diamond I ever saw . CHATTER Just my luck . Go for a meal , end up with a rock . p. 17 CLARENCE Listen , it 's starting to hum . CHATTER Great . A humming diamond , just what I need . Next thing you know , it 'll probably talk . VOICE Who are you two , and what brings you here ? CHATTER What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over there ! SMILE As they turned , they beheld the most beautiful creature they had ever seen . Her lips were like pearls . Rubies , sorry , rubies . Her skin was like pearls . Or alabaster . Also , she looked very sad . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS How did you know where to find the diamond from my missing father 's crown ? CLARENCE We are looking for the orphaned regent , Sad Princess Gladys . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Look no more . CHATTER You do n't understand , lady , we have important business with the woman . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS I am she who you seek . CLARENCE But you you 're beautiful . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS I know . Beautiful and sad . CHATTER ( After a pause ) : Is that it ? Have we done it ? p. 18 CLARENCE First we must learn why she 's sad , then I must make her smile . CHATTER Why ? CLARENCE To get back my courage . CHATTER Oh , right , right . You go ahead , I 'll cover you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or was it a western ? CLARENCE Princess Gladys CHATTER Clar , was I in a western ? CLARENCE Princess Gladys , I 've been seeking you to ask a question . What makes you so sad ? Will you answer ? SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Since you discovered where I buried the largest diamond from my missing father 's crown yes . I will tell you what I 've told no living creature before this day . I am in mourning for my life . No , that 's wrong . I am a seagull . No , that 's not it . CHATTER She 's a real hoot , this one . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS I am forever sad because my mother and father , who others knew as the king and queen because that is what they were , disappeared when I was first born , spirited away by a witch , they say , and by a magic spell turned into creatures of another species . Each year I take a month off to look for them in the woods , petting all the animals I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture , some sign of my heritage . Each year I fail , alas , and then I return to the palace and hold a feast to help take my mind off it . Eating sometimes helps . It 's a form of substitute behavior common among the well-to-do , and I 'm no exception . p. 19 CLARENCE If you were a mere baby when they disappeared , is n't it time to stop being sad ? SAD PRINCESS GLADYS But I do n't wish to stop . And even if I wished to , it would be wrong , terribly wrong . You see , it 's good to be sad . I want everyone in my kingdom to be sad in every part of their body , just as I am . My skin is sad , my hands are sad , my hair is by no , that 's not it . My eyes are sad , my lips are sad , and I could cry until I melt into a warm puddle of salt tears . ( CLARENCE , without realizing it , starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the soil and water all the land until trees grow sad and the grass grows sad and the rivers run sadly through the kingdom SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Are you making fun of me , commoner ? CLARENCE And even then I wo n't be satisfied until the clouds breathe in my tears from the forest and cause the rain to fall sad and the wind to blow sad and the entire world to weep and weep and weep . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS I am a princess . Keep it up and I 'll make a lot of trouble for you . CLARENCE I 'm your subject . Keep it up and you 'll make a lot of trouble for me . ( CLARENCE is now enjoying it ) p. 20 SAD PRINCESS GLADYS One more word and I shall strike you with my royal open palm . CLARENCE But sadly , princess , do it sadly . ( PRINCESS raises her hand to strike . Stops ) SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Is that really the way I look ? CHATTER He 's got you down to a tee , lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's ridiculous . You mean I 've been going around all these years looking like that ? Why did n't someone tell me ? ( Laughs ) I could die with shame if it was n't so funny . CHATTER Hey , Clar , do you realize what you just did ? You imitated her . And she 's laughing ! CLARENCE It just came out . She looked in my eyes , and I do n't know it gave me courage . Is that what love is ? ( Enter FROGS ) FEMALE FROG Look , dear , she 's laughing . MALE FROG If she laughs , the spell is broken . We forgot to say that part . ( BOTH FROGS stand up straight , now the KING and QUEEN ) FEMALE FROG Darling ! p. 21 MALE FROG My dear daughter . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Mother ? Father ? It 's really you . And guess what , I 'm in love . With him . What 's your name ? CLARENCE Clarence . SAD PRINCESS GLADYS Can I marry him , please , please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MALE FROG Welcome , Clarence , to the royal family , ribbit-rib whoops . SMILE And with that , Clarence returned home a hero , and Placeville welcomed him with open arms . ( Enter FATHER , MOTHER , MAYOR , MAGISTRATE , and MINISTER ) MOTHER BAKER My son , the king ! FATHER BAKER Good boy , good good boy . MAYOR We 're pleased and anxious to suck up to certain elements of the newly returned royal personage . MINISTER His **27;3561;TOOLONG talent , in particul-l-l-l-lar . MAGISTRATE A question ? An answer ! SMILE So Mr. Baker got his franchise , Clarence regained his talent forever , and year after year the palace rang with laughter as he imitated everyone in sight . And at long long last , Chatter found his bone . ( SMILE removes bone from inside pocket , or produces it like magic . CHATTER , behind him , approaches the bone , but the moment before he clamps his jaw around it , SMILE remembers something and begins to speak , waving the bone oblivious of CHATTER , who stands right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The moral ? p. 22 ALL The moral . SMILE If you have a talent , do n't be frightened when it upsets people because one day you 'll marry a princess and no one will dare mess with you ! Not very universal , is it ? I 'm terrible at ends . How about let 's see pompous behavior deserves to be laughed at ? Or do n't pooh-pooh large frogs in the forest , they may be royalty . Or this : Anton Chekhov was a great writer , but when you quote him out of context even his dialogue sounds laughable . Or CHATTER Give a dog a break . ( SMILE hands him the bone ) SMILE And they all lived happily ever after . CLARENCE ( Like SMILE ) : Because I commanded it , and I was the king . SMILE The end . ( ALL bow and exit )                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
