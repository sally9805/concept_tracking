After analyzing himself via not just one memory play but a trilogy  --  Brighton Beach Memoirs , Biloxi Blues and Broadway Bound  --  Neil Simon said he wanted to write a play without depth or aspiration , one that was simply funny . So he has turned to old-fashioned , door-slamming , crockery-smashing farce . Given that his third marriage broke up as he was writing , it is not surprising that Rumors , which opened on Broadway last week , concerns the vulnerability of the marital relationship to gossipmongering by friends ready to believe the worst . <P> Any Simon work is eagerly anticipated : Rumors has a box-office advance of more than $2 million . Although preview audiences cheered , in truth the play falls far short of its promise . The plot , which could only have been concocted by a media-shy celebrity , unfolds at a party where the host , a deputy mayor of New York City , lies bleeding from a bullet wound in the earlobe . He is too dazed to talk . His wife and servants are missing . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover-up , avoiding scandal ostensibly for their host but also for themselves . Instead of hewing to the consistent if mad logic of successful farce , the conspirators lurch haphazardly from rationale to rationale . <P> Ron Leibman and Jessica Walter are funny as a crass accountant and his smug wife . Ken Howard and Lisa Banes have striking moments as a would-be state senator and his disenchanted spouse . But the other couples  --  Andre Gregory and Joyce Van Patten as a spaced-out therapist and his oddball wife , and Mark Nelson and Christine Baranski as neurotic lawyers  --  derive from TV rather than life . Gene Saks , who won two Tony Awards directing the trilogy , finds few nuances here . W.A.H . III
