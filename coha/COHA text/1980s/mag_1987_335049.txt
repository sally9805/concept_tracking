Love is not an easy game to play , particularly when the jousters can not decide whether they seek passion or dispassion , rapturous attachment or jaded detachment . In the megalomaniacal gambitry of Les Liaisons Dangereuses , a glittering epistolary novel by Choderlos de Laclos set on the eve of revolution in 18th century France , the only thing more dangerous than a seducer 's assailing a person of virtue is the seducer 's somehow falling in love : the conflict between the rakehell 's manipulative pride and his newly vulnerable passion ignites everything in its path , leaving him and his partners burned-out husks , dead or wishing they were . A novel of letters is not easily transmuted into a cinematic montage of stage action . Yet Les Liaisons has been adapted into an equally brilliant and witty tragedy of manners by Christopher Hampton ( The Philanthropist , Total Eclipse ) for Britain 's Royal Shakespeare Company . The R.S.C. staging , which won the 1986 Olivier award for best play , the West End 's equivalent of the Tony , has been imported intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first glimpse the show speaks in portents . The chief piece of furniture is a preposterously tall highboy , its drawers spilling out cloth and papers and ropes of pearls just as the characters are about to spill out secrets , its surface appearing as unvarnished as the truths to come . Every character with a sexual life is dressed in some variation of off-white  --  and looks cool , stylish and slightly soiled . Two ornate sofas are shrouded with crumpled , much used sheets : this is a world of ceaseless , unsatisfying copulation . Although the sides of the stage are heaped with the bric-a-brac of elegance  --  candelabra , statuary , flowers  --  the characters seem more at home with simple louvered screens , behind which they peep and eavesdrop . The dialogue is fittingly brittle and epigrammatic . " When it comes to marriage , " a much traveled woman says , " one man is as good as the next ; and even the least accommodating is less trouble than a mother . " <P> The central figures in this roundelay are a bewitchingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to self-betrayal by love ( Suzanne Burden ) , a virgin eager to surrender to ecstasy ( Beatie Edney ) and the highborn roue who is their sequential wooer ( Alan Rickman ) . The essence of the roue 's sexual appeal is a chilly , offhand disinterest . Neither kind nor attentive nor particularly virile , he does not so much inspire devotion as command it ; he does not so much arouse ardor as compel his victims to confront their suppressed sexuality . He believes all virtue is fraud , and he delights in destroying women by making them believe so too . He has only one love , the marquise , and she is less a companion than a rival . Rickman and Duncan are at once captivating and appalling . Theirs is a black-widow-spider courting ritual of conquests and abrupt abandonments . <P> But these creatures are not immune to their own venom . Howard Davies ' direction , unobtrusive until the marquise declares war on her erstwhile sparring partner , fills the play 's final minutes with haze and glare and an eerie , slow-motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent survivors . Yet there is no comforting afterglow of justice or even vengeance  --  only the acrid residue of wanton agony .
