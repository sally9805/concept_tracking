The N.H.L. ' s sharpest shooter has just begun to fight <P> Toe Blake knows a little something about scoring goals in hockey games . As a player for the Montreal Canadiens , Blake led the National Hockey League in points ( goals plus assists ) in 1939 . In 13 seasons as the Canadiens coach , he won eight Stanley Cup titles and shepherded the careers of Maurice ( " Rocket " ) Richard , Jean Beliveau and Bernie ( " Boom-Boom " ) Geoffrion . From behind the bench , Blake schemed to stop such high-scoring opponents as Gordie Howe , Bobby Hull , Phil Esposito and Stan Mikita . So when it comes to evaluating hockey 's newest natural wonder , the New York Islanders ' Right Wing Mike Bossy , Blake is succinct : " Why is Mike Bossy great ? That 's easy . He scores goals . " <P> Lots of them . Earlier this season , in only his 244th game , Bossy scored the 200th goal of his career . Thus in slightly more than three years in the N.H.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 123 players . His closest challenger , Richard , required 336 games to reach 200 goals . This month Bossy set an N.H.L. record for hat tricks ( three goals or more in a game ) in a single season , with eight . In his first 49 games this year , Bossy poured in 48 goals , the hottest scoring pace since Richard 's 1945 mark of 50 goals in 50 games . For Bossy , such feats are merely doing what comes naturally : " Nobody sets out to break records . You just play , you score , and they happen . But the 50-in-50 , that 's one I want . Having my name next to Richard would not be too shabby . " <P> Born in Montreal , the fifth often children , Bossy grew up playing with his brothers on a rink set up in the backyard by his father , an industrial engineer . As a peewee and junior , he poured the puck into the net so often that the French-speaking Quebecois adopted Bossy , whose parents are English , as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike , in the newspaper stories extolling his scoring exploits . In four years as a junior player with the Laval Nationals , he scored 308 goals , but was passed over by 14 teams in the amateur draft because it was thought he could not play defense . The Islanders snapped him up , and in his second season he led the league in goals with 69 , a total bested only by Phil Esposito 's 1971 record of 76 . Bossy also won the N.H.L. 's Rookie of the Year trophy . <P> Along the way he learned to forecheck , ride opponents into the boards and otherwise play defense . At 24 , he has become a rounded player . Says Bossy : " I was never asked to do that before , but I want to be more than a goal scorer . " <P> He is still disarmingly in awe of his talent . " It 's hard for me to admit that I have something other people do n't , " he notes , adding , " but I do . " Tony Esposito , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bossy has the knack of hitting the open spot in the net , just like my brother Phil . You ca n't teach that . You have to be born with that instinct for the spot where the goalie isn't. "
