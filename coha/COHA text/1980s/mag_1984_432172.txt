 | When did you last dig into a serving of roasted squirrel poivrade ? How about a plate of smoked buffalo au kiwi ? Never ? Well , your time has come . Once almost solely the preserve of hunters , game cooking is the newest gastronomic trend to hit America 's restaurants , supermarkets and home kitchens . " People do n't order beef , because they can get that anywhere , " says Kevin Dowling , owner and chef of Denver 's Plum Tree Cafe . " I ca n't sell a New York strip steak , but beaver with brown sugar and almonds does very well . " Game has become big business . Denver meat distributor Dale Beier , who deals only in game , says that his annual revenue has jumped from $200,000 to $800,000 in the past two years . Seppi Renggli , chef at New York 's chic Four Seasons restaurant , uses almost 4,000 pounds of venison annually ? six times as much as a few years ago . And there are several new game cookbooks out ? notably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judith Jones . Fantasy : Why the sudden interest in game ? As Washington restaurateur Dominique D'Ermo sees it , diners are bored . " Americans who can afford to eat gourmet food are getting tired of fresh salmon and watercress salad . They 're searching for fantasy ? for something new . " At his restaurant , Dominique , that might include kangaroo bourguignonne , alligator scallopini and moose nose . D'Ermo says he tries to fulfill any reasonable request , although he drew the line when one guest asked him to prepare stuffed monkey . Sniffs D'Ermo : " We have never served anything grotesque . " But diner 's ennui is not the only reason for game 's gains . The fare is , simply , more avail- able now : in the past few years , game-park owners who used to breed deer , antelope and other animals for drive-through zoos decided there was more money to be made marketing the creatures as food . Today , says Tony Berns of the Iron Gate Products meatsupply company , " you can get almost anything that breathes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise them all . " In the process , the animals have lost much of their " gamy " taste . " Personally I have a very difficult time telling the difference " between chicken and domestically raised pheasant , says game distributor Brian Reif . And the young , grass-fed venison you buy today bears little resemblance to the leathery steaks from 20-year-old bucks that spent their lives foraging on sagebrush and tree bark . Also , explains chef Bill Parton of Denver 's Buckhorn Exchange restaurant , the characteristic pungent flavor of game stems in part from the adrenaline that courses through the frightened animals ' systems when they are stalked by hunters . Deer raised on game farms have no such fear . The trick is to lose enough of the wildness to make the meat palatable yet still intriguing to finicky diners . After all , says William Pflug , chef of the American Bar and Grill in Santa Monica , Calif. : " When you bite into wild boar , you want it to taste like wild boar , not like pork loin . " Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for you . Judy Hebbring of the National Buffalo Association points to a South Dakota State University study showing that buffalo has at least one-third less fat and one-third more protein than corresponding beef cuts , and only half the calories . And venison , says Berns , is probably the most healthful meat of all because it has virtually no cholesterol . But game is not for everyone . Some deplore the new cuisine because , says Fund for Animals vice president Lewis Regenstein , " any time you increase the commercial demand for animals , you obviously put more pressure on both them and their environment . " Also , game is wildly expensive ? more so at the market than in restaurants , where the portions are usually very small . Pheasant sells for as much as $7.99 a pound at supermarkets or gourmet shops , and a quail dinner for three will set shoppers back about $18.99 . The more exotic the animal , the higher the cost : whole rattlesnake , which is quite chewy and tastes something like chicken , was recently $9.89 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Va. , while a pound of camel round was a whopping $17.99 . But none of that matters to real game enthusiasts , who are delighted with the new opportunities . One of these is D'Ermo , who regularly takes out an ad in The Washington Post to trumpet his game specials . For some time now , he has hunted for a source to supply him with one " delicacy " that is the key ingredient of an obscure 19th-century recipe . " An elephant 's foot , " he grins , " that would be the zenith . " 79
