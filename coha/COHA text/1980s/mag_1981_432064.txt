 | One unmistakable message comes through loud and clear here in Venezuela , an oil-wealthy nation of importance to the United States : Billions of dollars in oil money have not brought this South American nation social equality or economic stability or the influence that it seeks abroad . With all its oil riches , Venezuela should be sitting on top of the world . Yet the reality is that its flood of oil exports has transformed this country of 15.3 million people into a land of disturbing contrasts . On one side : Dazzling affluence , marked by palatial homes , towering skyscrapers , expensive cars , fancy clothes , luxury hotels and exclusive restaurants jammed with business executives talking of billion-dollar deals . On the other side : Slums , polluted air , shortages of water and electricity , a stagnant economy and a bureaucracy that is inept even by infamous Latin American standards . At the same time , ambitious Venezuelan hopes that soaring oil fortunes would lead to increased leverage in dealings with the U.S. and Third World countries up to now have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is encountering suspicion from Venezuela 's neighbors , but is facing sharp disagreements with the U.S. over trade and foreign policy . Of special concern to Washington are strong differences between the U.S. and Venezuela on how to curb expansion by Communist Cuba within the Hemisphere . Although staunchly anti-Communist , Herrera is convinced that Cuban adventurism can be deterred by stepping up economic assistance ? not military aid ? to nations of the Caribbean and Central America . As a result , Venezuela is giving financial support to the Marxist-led Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and is attempting , with Mexico , to negotiate a compromise between El Salvador 's warring factions . Both moves run counter to Reagan administration policies and could strain relations with the U.S. that had been improving markedly since Herrera came to power more than two years ago . On the surface , Venezuela 's problems seem to pale in comparison with its vast mineral wealth . With oil alone now yielding an estimated 20 billion dollars a year in revenues , the country presents an image of luxurious living that is enjoyed by few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller cars , Venezuelan motorists crowd South America 's most extensive freeway system in eight-cylinder models laden with gas-guzzling gadgets . Venezuela is the world 's largest per capita consumer of Scotch whisky , importing 1.8 million cases last year . Travel abroad continues to climb . Venezuelans spend an estimated 1 billion dollars a year on sightseeing , business and shopping trips to the U.S. alone . In Miami and other cities favored by the Venezuelans , Spanish-speaking merchants refer to the free-spending South Americans as los damedos ( the give-me-two people ) . Airline executives exult that their planes stay full no matter how many more seats are added to accommodate the rush . The most frequent travelers are importers , engineers , bankers , brokers , government officials and families . Black gold . The money for all this flying and buying comes from a treasure trove of minerals : Bauxite , iron ore , diamonds and gold ? but especially oil . State-owned wells in shallow Lake Maracaibo pump 2.2 million barrels daily , 1.8 million for export . About 40 percent of that sold abroad goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American oil  | imports . The 20 billion dollars a year the oil brings in accounts for 95 percent of all export earnings and for nearly half of Venezuela 's total production of goods and services . But for all its wealth , Venezuela remains for many of its citizens a " have not " society . Herrera and his Social Christian Party are under fire from many sides ? the Social Democrat opposition , leftists , elements of the labor , business , religious and intellectual communities ? for failing to distribute the wealth more fairly . Critics contend that 4 out of every 10 workers earn less than $500 a month ? a healthy sum in most Third World countries , but not here because of the high cost of living . Venezuelans need look no further than the slums on hills above Caracas to realize that poverty remains . How many people live below the poverty line is hard to determine . Many are unregistered aliens . It is estimated that at least 2 million Colombians and from 1 million to 2.5 million people from elsewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venezuela 's mineral wealth allows the country to take better care of its poor than most Latin nations . The government spends billions of dollars a year on food and fuel subsidies and sets prices for basic goods such as shoes , lower-quality clothing and food staples . Also in the works are plans to trade oil for foreign know-how in building prefabricated low-cost homes . Economic challenges are not the government 's only problems . Herrera assumed power in March , 1979 , on a platform pledging to improve efficiency , slash red tape and root out the corruption that ran rampant under his predecessor , Carlos Andres Perez . Many feel he has failed to live up to his promises . One criticism that is heard frequently : " The Perez government was the most corrupt in our history . This one is the most incompetent . " " We are badly governed and badly administered , " says one financial leader . " Herrera is neither fighting inflation nor stimulating the economy . " Among specific targets for complaint : The state airline , where 20 flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with more than 100,000 lines that never have been connected ; the steel company , which used 25 man-hours last year to turn out what foreign mills produce in 10 . The armed forces have been especially critical of Herrera 's failure to root out corruption . Military grumbling over dishonesty , plus complaints about the government 's handling of festering border disputes with Guyana and Colombia , grew so strong last year that speculation spread about a coup d'etat . Since then , such talk has faded . Herrera argues that changes take time , particularly because his party failed to win a majority of seats in Congress , and he can not get the other parties to cooperate . But he insists that major improvements are on the way . For the U.S. , Herrera 's program for reform may prove both a boon and a headache . Venezuela bought 5.4 billion dollars ' worth of U.S. goods and services last year . To meet rising needs , imports in 1981 are expected to be higher , notably for food , machinery and engineering services . ' To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seeking to boost oil production , a move that would benefit U.S. firms . Industrial giants such as Exxon , Lummus , Texaco and Bechtel are being tapped to help develop existing fields and to bring trillion-barrel deposits of heavy oil on the Orinoco River into production . America 's Phillips Petroleum has played a key role in enabling the state-owned petroleum company to get all its plants in operation for the first time . Venezuela also hopes to buy 16 to 24 sophisticated , U.S.-built F-16 jet fighters to modernize its Air Force . But Herrera wants more than arms , expertise and technology from the U.S. In effect , Venezuela is convinced that Washington and the U.S. financial industrial community have been calling the shots long enough . Says Foreign Minister Jose Alberto Zambrano : " Comprehension and cooperation are essential ? without confrontation . " " Comprehension , " as Zambrano sees it , means U.S. willingness to accede to a long list of demands . Among them The sale to the state oil company ? at bargain prices ? of a sizable share of U.S. oil-refining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Paying for oil with technology as well as cash . Recognizing that petroleum-producing nations have a right to market their products through a cartel such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . It was a Venezuelan mining minister who thought up the idea of OPEC in the 1950s . Caracas also wants the U.S. to follow Venezuela 's lead in battling Cuba and other extremists by shunning military muscle flexing in favor of economic aid to less developed Latin nations . But even Venezuelans are far from optimistic that the U.S. will give in . Says Mining and Energy Minister Humberto Calderon Berti : " It seems difficult to reach agreement with the United States along those lines . " As a result , Venezuela is pursuing some of those ends on its own by expanding trade with Brazil , France and Italy . Although former President Perez once experimented with industrial diversification , most Venezuelans now agree that oil is the key to the nation 's future prosperity . Bonanza ? This country 's oil reserves total some 18 billion barrels , and there are large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run are Venezuela 's huge reserves of so-called heavy oil , which until recently was too expensive or difficult to develop . Most authorities place potential reserves along the Orinoco at between 1 and 2 trillion barrels . Technology now available , or in sight , would allow commercial recovery of 10 to 12 percent , but continuing improvements in technology promise to yield far more . Even a 15 percent rate would mean the recovery of 150 billion to 200 billion barrels , about the amount estimated to lie beneath the sands of Saudi Arabia . It is this potential oil bonanza that enables Herrera to promise to improve the lot of Venezuela 's poor and to push demands on the United States and other industrial nations . But , in the words of one expert on Latin American affairs : " Pledges are one thing , and progress is another . Venezuelans and Americans remain to be convinced that Herrera really can turn this petrodollar society around . "                    @
