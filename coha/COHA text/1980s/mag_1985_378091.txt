BRING ON THE NIGHT <P> Is Sting the perfect person ? If we are to believe this film , the rock idol comes as close to that status as mortal man may aspire . It chronicles , from early rehearsals through first concerts , the formation of his new band , composed entirely of black American jazz musicians . Sting is convinced that their music and his should cross-fertilize . Besides , he is striking a blow against the " reactionary and racist " music business . Objectively , it has never seemed a dangerous hotbed of those sentiments , but the man 's heart is in the right place . Just watch him being loyal , trustworthy , gutsy and modest . Also creative , wise and sensitive . One could almost imagine Mother Teresa sitting in for a set . But Michael Apted 's documentary is lively and well made and has a saving sense of humor . If Sting is only half as good as the movie makes him out to be , that may still be enough for most earthly purposes.KRUSH GROOVE <P> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blues/ By the bro 's from the Bronx in their burgundy shoes. /And now their story 's on the screen at the Multiplex. / ( Ralph Farquhar wrote the script ; Michael Schultz he directs. ) / And the boys who made the noise are in their very own show : / Run-D.M.C. , the Fat Boys , Kurtis Blow. / Then there 's Blair Underwood , a kind of Poitier hunk , / And Sheila E. ( Prince 's princess ) in her foppery funk. / Now there 've been fights at the Plexes , kids 've got out of hand , / But they must 've spiked the sodas at the popcorn stand/ Because this movie has the innocence of bygone years , / Like the films of Fred ( Rock Around the Clock ) F. Sears. / I mean they even got a deacon who berates the boys/ By sayin ' " That 's not music  --  just screamin ' an ' noise . " / And when Blair and Sheila E. meet romantic-like , Jack , / You can hear the Mantovani sugar up the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you find in the Louvre , / But if you wan na go deaf you ought a rush to Krush Groove.TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. <P> Bad Guy : Why 're you chasin ' me ? T-Man : Why 're you runnin ' ? Bad Guy : Because you 're chasin ' me ! <P> That 's about as complex as the dialogue and characters get in this chic , wanton thriller . To which Director William Friedkin might riposte , " They 're called movies , you know , not chatties or peo-plies . " L.A. does move , notably in a brutal , bloated car-chase sequence pilfered from Friedkin 's nifty The French Connection . In his God's-eye-view shots and acrobatic love scenes , he also pays tribute to the styles of Martin Scorsese and MTV . So the villain , Counterfeiter Willem Dafoe , is no more rotten or less picturesque than the hero , William Petersen . So everybody stinks . It matters not when , like Friedkin , you have fashioned a fetid movie hybrid : Miami Vile .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
