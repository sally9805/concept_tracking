New York  --  Say you are a high-flying West Coast corporate biggie and you ' ve just restored the Art Deco lobby of your headquarters in Redwood City , Calif . Now you need a piece of period sculpture ( vaguely uplifting , nothing naughty or abstract , at least three feet tall ) to display there . Who you gon na call ? A corporate art adviser . Ten years ago the chairman ' s sister-in-law or an interior decorator might have served , but now that corporations have become art lovers ( 60% of the Fortune 500 collects art , says the Business Committee for the Arts ) , they are relying increasingly on professionals  --  like Tamara Thomas . Ms. Thomas , 44 , president of Fine Arts Services Inc. of Los Angeles , acquires $3 million of art a year for banks , real estate developers , law firms and utilities . Though many of her clients  --  Columbia Federal Savings &; Loan , the Gerald Hines Interests , C.J. Segerstrom &; Sons  --  are in the South and West , Ms. Thomas schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent sprinting down 57th Street and through Soho , hitting a few auctions or East Side galleries , looking and comparing and sowing checks . " It would be impossible , " Ms. Thomas said on her most recent expedition , her cab bearing down on 57th and Fifth , " to find this kind of sculpture I ' m looking for in California . " Bob , sculpture , " she announces , bustling into the Schoelkopf Gallery and explaining her latest assignment . " How about a Manship ? " " Perfect , if I could just find one , " Ms. Thomas sighs . Works by Paul Manship , hovering above Rockefeller Center , have been quadrupling in price at recent auctions , and Ms. Thomas may have to settle for a less-known contemporary . Robert Schoelkopf offers a silvery Ceres that ' s too small , a Manship bronze of three bears that ( at $250 , 000 ) is too expensive , a firm-breasted Venus that ' s too . . . nude . Then he produces a slide of a Manship relief of a hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique Greeks . There ' s a lion crouched up here in the pediment . " And , he points out , " this young man is discreetly clothed . " " It has all the right vibrations , " Ms. Thomas considers , squinting at the slide . " A very macho sort of thing . " " Exactly . It would be fabulous . " It would also cost 50% more than her corporate client wants to spend , but Ms. Thomas takes the slide to show the chairman at their next meeting . " They might go for it , " she says . " It depends on what else I show them , what they had for lunch , how the stock ' s doing that day . " Her next appointment is a few doors away at Eastdil Realty , which has two floors of newly renovated offices with blank walls and a president who ' s a private collector . An hour later , Ms. Thomas emerges carrying blueprints and promising to submit a proposal . It will be a small job by her standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s major art consulting firms , requires a minimum expenditure of $50 , 000 and regularly commissions important outdoor sculptures for which developers pay $75 , 000 to $250 , 000  --  and up . " Aesthetic product identification , " Ms. Thomas calls them . Seriously art-minded corporations now spend between 0. 5% and 2% of the cost of new projects on art . A dollar per square foot of office building is merely an " adequate " art budget , she judges . " Nothing to put you on the map . " Pacific Bell , her largest current project , will be on the map . Fine Arts is halfway through the two-year task of acquiring roughly 500 pieces for the company ' s new two-million-square-foot headquarters , now rising amid man-made lakes on 200 acres outside San Francisco . Pacific Bell doesn ' t like abstracts either ( " in corporate environments , there ' s conservative and more conservative , " Ms. Thomas says ) , so the collection will comprise paintings and prints by contemporary realists including , in the main lobby , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weber . It ' s the Weber piece that Ms. Thomas , who commissioned it , now heads downtown to the artist ' s studio to see for the first time . " Spectacular , " she cries , at the two 12-foot panels of canvas blazing with a garden Ms. Weber patterned after Monet ' s at Giverny . " I ' ve put every flower I know in it , " says the artist , more subdued . " I ' m still adding a few lupines . " " Corporations are the patrons of the day , the Medici , " says Marjory Jacobson , whose Fine Arts Planning Group has offices in Boston and New York . Like many of the new specialists , Ms. Jacobson is a former museum hand  --  she was director of exhibits at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ' s Hayden Gallery before she and her partner began advising corporations whose art budgets range from $100 , 000 to $750 , 000 . Like Ms. Thomas , she sometimes feels constrained by corporate tastes . And the mistrust can be reciprocal : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wall decorations . " A really serious artist still wants the professional credibility of being in a major museum , " Ms. Jacobson finds . There are , still , plenty of tacky collections ( Standard Oil of Indiana ' s is " just a joke , " Ms. Thomas sniffs , " green-eyed leopards with green mats in green frames " ) , just as there are hundreds of unqualified art advisers printing up business cards . But with corporations spending serious money and employing more knowledgeable consultants like Ms. Thomas , Ms. Jacobson , Janice Oresman ( who advises Chemical Bank ) and Mary Lanier ( formerly with Chase Manhattan , now consulting with Metropolitan Life and Becton Dickinson ) , all members of the selective Association of Professional Art Advisors , artists and executives are growing chummier . Some collections have attained museum quality : The Riklis Collection of McCrory Corp. , 249 works of geometric abstract art donated to New York ' s Museum of Modern Art , will be the centerpiece of a major exhibit there this fall , a breakthrough for corporate collecting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you ' d never know whom you ' d be hanging next to " ) , now acknowledges that " there are collections out there that are wonderful " and agrees to contribute . Indeed , Ms. Thomas says when word of a major project like Pacific Bell gets out , hopeful artists send up to 20 packets of slides a week to her office . At the moment , however , Pacific Bell for all its scope is proving less troublesome than that sculpture for the California lobby that Ms. Thomas has been pursuing for three months now . Her last cab-hop , before heading for the airport and home , takes her to the Upper East Side to see what the Hirschl &; Adler Galleries can offer from the American Renaissance works being exhibited . She discovers further options , if not a clear choice . A Daniel Chester French bronze of Lincoln , which Ms. Thomas thinks " embodies all the right virtues , " has already been sold for $135 , 000 . She walks regretfully past a nude Diana , pronounces a Saint Gaudens gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there ' s a Daniel Chester French plaster model of a crowned and robed figure affordable at $75 , 000 because it ' s missing one arm . " Hmmm , ' Wisdom , ' that might fly , " Ms. Thomas ponders . " It ' s about the scale we ' re looking for . And right on the budget . " But would they consider an amputee ?
