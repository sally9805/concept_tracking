Kohl makes a quick switch <P> The clocks in Bonn stood at 15 minutes to midnight when Economics Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorff appeared at the office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week to tender his resignation . The outspoken Lambsdorff , 57 , who had spent nearly seven years in the key Cabinet post , is expected soon to be formally charged by the Bonn public prosecutor 's office with accepting $50,000 on behalf of the Free Democratic Party ( F.D.P. ) from the Flick Holding Co. in exchange for allowing the firm generous tax writeoffs . Lambsdorff , who will retain his seat in the Bundestag , insisted on his innocence . " The charges will not hold up , " he declared . <P> Kohl praised Lambsdorff , then moved quickly to replace him . The Chancellor 's choice : Martin Bangemann , 49 , a lawyer and maverick F.D.P . leader from Baden-Wurttemberg .
