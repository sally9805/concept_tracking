In an interview , the chief of the Honduran armed forces , Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez , said the accord , signed Feb. 14 in El Salvador , was reached with the advice and approval of the Honduran military leadership . He said the military would cooperate with civilian leaders in developing a plan within 90 days for removing the contra bases , as required under the agreement. // But General Regalado added that he expected some contra units to use their weapons to resist the disbanding of their camps , even if they are offered the chance to resettle in the United States or other third countries . And he stressed that Honduran troops would accept no role in disarming contra fighters , a problem that he said must be resolved by regionwide diplomacy. // " The problem of the contras is no longer a problem of Honduras alone , " the general said at his office at the General Staff building here . " It is a problem of Costa Rica , Guatamala , El Salvador - of all the countries of Central America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by General Regalado , who wields crucial behind-the-scenes power in Honduran political life , seemed to reflect the wish of many Hondurans to distance their country ' s fortunes from those of the contras. // For Honduras , one of the hemisphere ' s poorest countries with an army of only 15 , 000 troops , the presence of contra forces that at one time numbered as many as 20 , 000 was always a mixed blessing , tolerated in return for large new American grants and loans and the expectation of a valuable new political relationship with Washington. // But with waning prospects that the contras will ever again see combat in Nicaragua , the question of what to do with them has come to dominate local political debate , as Hondurans contemplate the risks they say would be posed if the contra army gradually dispersed inside Honduras , becoming a factor in Honduran political struggles or simply turning to banditry. // American officials who oversee the $27 million in nonmilitary aid that supports the contra camps along the Nicaraguan border say that the rebels ' morale is high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely , using the contras as a permanent army-in-waiting to maintain psychological pressure on the Sandinistas . <> <> A Source of Much U.S. Aid // But many Hondurans do not seem to relish that prospect , either for its internal consequences or for its effect on their country ' s regional standing . The depth of Honduran anxiety over the issue was illustrated when President Jose Azcona Hoyo , apparently without American agreement , signed the accord committing Honduras , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Guatemala and Costa Rica to a plan for dismantling the contra camps in return for open elections and democratic guarantees in Nicaragua. // If the presence of the contras is now a cause of worry for the Hondurans , it has also been a source of considerable aid since the contra war began with a secret Presidential directive in late 1981. // According to the Congressional Research Service , American military aid to Honduras rose from $4 million in 1980 to an average of $64 million a year from 1983 to 1988 . Economic Support Fund assistance , a principal form of American foreign economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $147. 5 million at the height of the war effort . Development aid intended to promote economic growth has also grown substantially. // To the extent that Hondurans have complained about the contras in the past , it has generally been to demand a higher price from the United States for keeping them . Those pressures came to a boil in March 1984 when Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez , who had helped to build the contra force , was dismissed by other officers as leader of the Honduran military , and the Honduran Government tried to negotiate higher levels of American aid . General Alvarez was assassinated in Tegucigalpa on Jan. 25 . <> <> U.S. Move Heightens Concern // Honduran concern over the possible dissolution of the contras gained force last February when Congress refused to approve further military financing for them and in March when the contra leadership signed an interim cease-fire agreement with the Sandinista Government . Although the cease-fire talks broke down over the summer , officials on many sides of the dispute agree that the chances the war will begin again in earnest are very low. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ' s civilian politicians are more anxious to reach some resolution of the contra issue than Honduran military commanders , who tend to be more conservative and who have benefited from the large influx of military aid. // But Western diplomats say that part of the military ' s willingness to support the new accord apparently stems from a conclusion that the United States has little choice but to maintain its high aid levels . After years of joint exercises and the construction of large installations suitable for use by American forces , the close military contact between Honduras and the United States may now be less dependent on the presence of the contra bases. // Many Honduran officers are also said to believe that the dismantling of the contras will in fact produce an increase in American aid by leaving the Honduran military alone as a bulwark against Sandinista Nicaragua. // It also appears that , for all Honduran leaders , a main virtue of the accord reached in El Salvador is that it broadens the responsibility for the contras ' fate to all Central American presidents , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Honduras to stand united with its Central American neighbors in favor of removing the contras while making it clear to all that the final initiative remains in the hands of others. //
