The final draft of the Philippines ' new constitution was presented last week to President Corazon ( Cory ) Aquino at Malacanang Palace . " Democracy is safe with this constitution , " she said after receiving two copies of the 59-page document , one in English , the other in Pilipino . The charter will be put to a nationwide plebiscite on Jan. 23 . <P> One sticking point , though , is a rider to the constitution that grants Aquino a six-year term . Chief among opponents of the clause is Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile , who insists that Aquino should submit to new presidential elections . Enrile argues that Aquino lost her mandate to govern when she abandoned the 1973 constitution , under which the last elections were held . Aquino counters that during last February 's elections , " The people spoke so clearly , the whole world heard them . " Despite Enrile 's opposition , Aquino 's constitution is likely to be adopted .                  @ @ @
