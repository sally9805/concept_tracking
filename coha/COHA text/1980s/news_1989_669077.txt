Homewood-Flossmoor High School became the first high school in Illinois to adopt a program requiring the testing of student athletes for drugs , including alcohol and steroids , as the school board approved details of the plan Tuesday night . " It will work , " a confident Supt. Ed Rachford said . " We designed it that way . " About 15 athletes , chosen at random , will be tested each week . The board voted 5-2 after hearing the results of a parent survey and going over the policy for two hours . Erika Hanson , president of the school ' s parents association , said 79 percent of the 141 parents surveyed said testing should be conducted on all students and staff . Only 7 percent said the testing violated their children ' s rights . One parent wrote on the survey form : " My family is suffering from this problem and many of my friends from high school ( in 1968 ) are among the ranks of the roaming lost souls ' because their brains are fried . This problem will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was in school . " But another protested : " This is a fascist program . My child is an athlete , not a drug user . The program can ruin his/her life and can do him/her no good . " Board President Karen Hoffschmidt said the intention of the program is " not punishing but one to encourage athletes to get help . " The board had voted in September to adopt such a program . On Tuesday it decided exactly how to carry it out . Though the random drug testing will involve only athletes , it still could affect as many as 500 students , or nearly a quarter of the school ' s enrollment of 2 , 100 . The testing will begin in mid-January , after administrators choose one of four hospitals to give the tests . Rachford believes the hospital will be chosen in the next 30 days and said school administrators will take the tests first as part of the program ' s shakedown cruise . The entire cost of the program , said by Rachford to be " around $30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid for by an anonymous donor . " In any case , " he said , " we will never use tax money for this program , no matter what . " Each drug and alcohol test will cost around $38 , with an additional $100 for each steroid exam . Under the procedures adopted Tuesday , 5 percent of each athletic team will be selected for tests each week of that team ' s season . The actual number is expected to be about 15 a week . Those students will be tested for cocaine , marijuana , opiates , amphetamines , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , methadone , methaqualone , phencyclidine and propoxyphene , as well as alcohol . In addition , two of each group of students will be tested for steroids . A student who tests positive must take another test within 30 days . Although Rachford maintains that all such tests will be " completely confidential , " penalties are written into the policy . Any athlete testing positive must meet with a rehabilitation counselor . If the counselor finds the student to be chemically dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition for 30 days . If the athlete or his or her parent refuses to submit to assessment , he or she may be suspended from sports up to six weeks . The Homewood-Flossmoor plan is similar to one now in use by two high schools in Tippecanoe County , Ind . Rachford believes numerous high schools in Illinois " are waiting to see how we do our drug testing " before they also implement such a program . The decision to test came only after a lengthy meeting in which parents , students and teachers voiced sentiments pro and con . At one time , the board tentatively agreed to testing for all students involved in extracurricular activities , such as the band , the chess club and math competitions . But later the board decided to limit testing to athletes . That keeps it in line with the Indiana plan , which has survived two court tests . " Our attorneys tell us that if we stay with athletes , we ' ll stay out of the courts , " said Homewood-Flossmoor Principal Charles Smith , who had favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
