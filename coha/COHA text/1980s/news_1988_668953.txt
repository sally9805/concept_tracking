A relaxed-looking George Bush told a surfside news conference Monday that he may make more Cabinet appointments this week and he downplayed the falling dollar , saying " these gyrations happen . " In his first formal exchange with reporters since arriving Thursday night , Bush stood on the beach outside the villa where he is vacationing and spent about 30 minutes answering , and often deflecting , questions about his plans for the next administration . He frequently seemed cautious about his comments , which ranged from fishing to the dollar crisis , noting " I do not want to start acting like I am ( already ) President of the United States . " Bush , accompanied by his wife , Barbara , and their English springer spaniel , Millie , was pressed repeatedly about potential Cabinet appointments . He said only that " there will be no Cabinet announcements from these sands here . It is very early but I ' ve done a little research and most Cabinet announcements come a little later in the transition . . . we may have some this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will come this week . . . I don ' t feel under any great pressure . . . I will do it when I am ready . " Asked about persistent reports that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady would be asked to stay on , Bush said , " When I name my treasury secretary , you all will be among the first to know . " He reiterated an earlier promise to appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet , and said he " anticipated " there would be female representation as well , " but I don ' t like to put it like that . It sounds sort of quota-istic . " Of reports that he might have his White House headed by a triumvirate made up of Craig Fuller , his current chief of staff ; Robert Teeter , his pollster and confidante , and New Hampshire Gov . John Sununu , Bush replied , " Stay tuned . I ' ll have announcements on that fairly soon . " He said he and Sununu were having dinner at his vacation home Monday night .

" Bush , dressed in a casual red shirt , khaki pants , sunglasses and running shoes , repeatedly told the press how relaxed he felt . He dismissed intense press speculation about jockeying for appointments by saying , " I ' m so relaxed I don ' t even read about all that stuff any more . I don ' t get as uptight as I used to about it ; it doesn ' t mean anything . I ' m going to make the decisions , they know I ' m going to make the decisions .

On another foreign policy matter , Bush rejected an offer by Nicaragua ' s President Daniel Ortega for the two to hold direct peace talks .

The press conference ended when Bush spotted a youngster watching at one side and invited him to stand by the microphone . The little boy said his name was Eric and Bush then leaned over and whispered something in his ear . " Thank you very much , " Eric intoned into the microphone . " Your press conscience is over .
