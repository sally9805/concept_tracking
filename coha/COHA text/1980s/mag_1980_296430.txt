THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE : A PORTRAIT IN PHOTOGRAPHS by Chloe Obolensky ; Random House ; 345 pages ; $24.95 <P> In a typical 19th century Russian novel , " We open the door and find ourselves in a room full of Russian Generals , " said Virginia Woolf , who evidently failed to read on . Just as disconcerting is the immediate impression created by the pictures of prerevolutionary Russians in this remarkable book . Some have an aura that seems to owe more to taxidermy than to photography . In some respects , no medium was less appropriate for chronicling old Russia than the primitive camera . The dead stillness required of the subject , though unnatural to everyone , was singularly unsuited to the Russians ' vitality , spontaneity and general rambunctiousness . How stolid they look , gathered silently and ceremoniously around the samovar in the garden at tea time , when , as we can guess from Chekhov and Turgenev , they were surely spellbinding talkers . The trouble with such snapshots from a nation 's family album is that they must be viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while fiction may draw even the most unknowing into its universe . <P> Russia 's early photographers were sometimes responsible for distorting reality . Many were foreigners who roamed the gigantic empire seeking ethnographic oddities , the odder the better . Precursors of Soviet socialist realism , these photographers turned real people into " typical specimens " for the fashionable genre pictures of the times . The wandering holy man , the street musician , the Cossack and especially the peasant , in all his scruffy permutations , were persuaded to assume artful poses . One French photographer of the 1880s in Russia was fixated on funny-looking hats , which he set askew on his subjects ' heads when it suited his composition . The result often verged on caricature . <P> In one way , however , the petrified images produced by late 19th and early 20th century photography are tragically apposite . The Russian people were living under a volcano : " A rumbling , fire-spitting mountain , down whose sides , behind clouds of ashes , roll streams of red-hot lava , " as the poet Alexander Blok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 1917 , it engulfed the nation 's past . The Russian Empire 's vigorous intellectual life , its fantastic cultural diversity-even the distinctive imprint of its history-were effaced . <P> Thus the picture that emerges from this book is of Pompeii on a far vaster scale . The photos are imbued with more than the familiar charm of things past ; they are reflections of Russia 's interrupted life story . That would explain the particular poignancy of the emotion experienced by the book 's editor , Chloe Obolensky , as she studied the many photos she had unearthed from various libraries and private collections . She recalls in her preface that as the volume took shape , she was moved to see the photographs assume an unexpected " coherence and truth . " Few readers can fail to be moved as well . <P> Obolensky calls her book " a portrait in photographs " of the Russian Empire between the mid-1850s and 1914 . Her selection is , as it should be , highly personal , with quality and design elements as the governing considerations . Large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is a triumph of commercial publishing .
