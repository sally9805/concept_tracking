Ever since multinational corporations began crowding into California in the 1970s , they have been lobbying local legislators to repeal the state 's onerous " unitary tax " law . Under its provisions , these companies had to pay taxes on their global profits , rather than only on income made in California . The California legislature has now passed a bill allowing firms to pay a tax equivalent to just .03% of their statewide assets , payroll and sales . The new system is expected to cut the California taxes of some foreign companies by 75% or more . <P> A pleased Sony said last week that it would now invest some $30 million to expand its TV manufacturing plant in San Diego and $5 million in a new headquarters in Cypress . Other overseas firms that have avoided California are also expected to invest there .
