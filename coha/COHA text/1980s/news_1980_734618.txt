txt The Canadian government is heading toward an oil-price confrontation with Alberta that could lead the country 's main oil-producing province to attempt to cut supplies to the eastern half of the nation . Canada 's existing oil-price agreement expires July 1 . and Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed says that if a new agreement is n't concluded soon " we will have to reassess our continued sale of this rapidly depleting resource . " In a speech in Toronto , Mr. Lougheed criticized the Canadian government for pressuring the province to sell its oil " at less than 50% of its value . " He said the retail price of gasoline in Canada in inflationadjusted terms is marginally cheaper than in 1960 , which is " illogical and economically unsound . " The new Liberal Party federal government is renegotiating a proposal by the previous Progressive Conservative Party government that would have raised Canada 's domestic crude price to 85% of U.S. prices , or 85% of world prices , whichever is lower , by 1984 . The current domestic price is about 40% of international levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous government 's offer . But Canada 's new energy minister , Marc Lalonde , demands a smaller price rise without a loss of federal revenue . That would mean at least 52.5 billion ( Canadian ) less for Alberta and the oil-producing companies . Mr. Lougheed said that negotiations with Mr. Lalonde started badly and that he is pessimistic about the chances for agreement . He warned that " any unilateral action by the federal government would be resisted by our citizens in the strongest and most determined way . " It would be a " tragic miscalculation " if Ottawa underestimated Alberta 's resolve , he said . Both Alberta and Ottawa , citing different sections of the Canadian constitution , claim the right to set oil prices and receive revenue from Alberta 's production , but neither side has tested its power until now , preferring to settle the matter by agreement . The last accord , in June 1977 , called for increases of Si a barrel ( 85 U.S. cents ) every six months , bringing the average domestic price of crude to 514.75 ( 512.53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further increases are n't scheduled under that agreement . The oil revenue was split , with about 45% accruing to Alberta , 45% to the oil companies and 10% to Ottawa . Federal officials long have been worried this division is allowing Alberta to amass a multibillion-dollar trust fund while the federal government has to shoulder a huge deficit , caused in part by oil  --  import subsidies paid in eastern Canada . Alberta produces about 1.4 million barrels of crude oil daily , supplying more than 90% of Canada 's output and about 70% of the country 's needs . Some oil is produced in Saskatchewan , and the rest of Canada 's needs are met through imports .
