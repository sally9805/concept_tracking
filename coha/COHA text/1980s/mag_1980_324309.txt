Classroom Crisis <P> To the Editors : <P> Hey , young America : What do you want to be when you grow up ? How about being a teacher June 16 ? After a B.S. , an M.S. and 20 years ' experience , you can make $18,000 a year , teach five classes a day , grade homework for 150 students at night , do bus and early-morning duty and attend extracurricular events after school . Plus you get to read , at least once a month , articles telling you how incompetent you are and what a lousy job you are doing . <P> Sounds terrific , does n't it ? Somehow , though , it is satisfying and it is rewarding . <P> Noureen Byrd <P> Grand Prairie , Texas <P> " Teacher burnout " indeed . What American education needs is more grit and determination and less weeping and wailing . Too many teachers have been coddled too long . Test every one of them . They should either measure up or flunk right out of the classroom . <P> Roberta Brown Sanders <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with verbal abuse , disobedience , cheating , apathy , and stealing of and damage to personal property on the part of those I tried to teach . You wo n't see me in September . <P> Edward Borucki <P> Southampton , Mass . <P> When I first glanced at your cover illustration with its title " Help ! Teachers Ca n't Teach , " I thought , " Oh , no , here we go again-another damning article on education . " But I was pleasantly surprised . As a teacher , I want to thank you . You spelled out many of the existing problems of education very well . <P> Nancy W. Sears <P> Wellesley , Mass . <P> If there 's anything the teaching profession does n't need to add to its troubles , it 's an article like yours-sure to encourage more parents to say , " It 's O.K. , <P> Johnny . You do n't have to listen to So-and-So . She does n't know anything anyway . " Thanks a lot , TIME . <P> Rebecca A. Young <P> Skowhegan , Me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eighth , as well as courses for the gifted , normal and exceptional . From then on education should be voluntary , with one school for liberal arts and one or more for vocational , trade , shop or agriculture , depending on the community needs . <P> Richard L. Auten <P> Stratford , Conn . <P> I dream the impossible dream : a class of manageable size , students who read close to grade level , and parents who care . <P> Laurel Wasserman <P> Rancho Cucamonga , Calif . <P> By their illegal strikes and defiance of court orders , teachers have helped create the climate of lawlessness that now haunts them in their own classrooms . <P> Robert J. McNaughton <P> Roslyn Heights , N. Y. <P> May I say that I would be most proud to teach down the hall from Helen Scott ? I feel there is more than semantics involved when she refers to her class as " children " rather than " kids , " and the individual as " a child " rather than " a kid . " <P> Pat Grisak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you seem to have avoided one important and growing problem . That is the impossibility of teaching students who are high or low on marijuana , alcohol , or some other drug . <P> E. Jane Palmer <P> Grand Blanc , Mich.
