WOLFEN Directed by Michael Wadleigh Screenplay by David Eyre and Michael Wadleigh <P> A rich-as-Rockefeller tycoon and his ice-blond wife are found murdered , their throats torn open but no trace of metal from a weapon in the wounds . Who could have savaged them ? Wolves . Or , rather , American Indians who have " shifted shape " and become supernatural " wolfen . " They hunt in tribes in decaying slums , preying on " the diseased and those who wo n't be missed . " They never come downtown - until the tycoon 's urban renewal plan threatens their turf . <P> From this nonsense emerges an eerie , seductive thriller that works equally as a mordant police procedural , an occult horror story and an ambivalent look at aborigines fighting for tradition in the technological age . Dialogue is cynical and the cast beguilingly quirky , notably Albert Finney as a detective and Gregory Hines as a manic , mock-suave coroner . Visual effects evoke for the audience the heightened senses of a preternatural predator . <P> Wadleigh may take that identification too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . <P> - By William A.
