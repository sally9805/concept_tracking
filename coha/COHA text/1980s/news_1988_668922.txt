If nothing else , Jeff Tarango did get to hold the $5 , 000 check in his hand . He did not , however , get to hold it very long .

" It goes to the Junior Development Fund of the USTA ( U.S. Tennis Association ) . It helps pay my expenses and the national team ' s travel . It also helps the juniors below us , " said Tarango , a member of the 1988 U.S. national team . " It ' s hard to see the money go , but I don ' t regret it . " Unseeded Ricardo Acuna and Royce Deppe posted a 6-4 , 6-4 victory over Jared Palmer and Pete Sampras , also unseeded , to win the doubles championship . The singles finalists , also both unseeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly known as the A.C. Nielsen Tennis Center . " It was a little too hot , " Tarango said of the 90-degree temperatures and oppressive humidity . " I think it got to Pozzi a little more than it got to me in the third set , though . " This was the first pro championship won by Tarango , a quarterfinalist in the Citicorp tournament last year , and will probably assure the Manhattan Beach , Calif. , left-hander a berth in the main draw of the U.S. Open , which begins Aug. 29 . A philosophy major , Tarango will return to Stanford for his junior season after helping the school win the NCAA title last spring . " I had to make the decision before the summer started whether to remain an amateur or turn pro , " he said . " I don ' t regret not turning pro . Right now , college is an unbelievable experience . The people you meet there are unbelievable . " I don ' t regret it , but it is hard to see the money go .

But the 22-year-old Pozzi , also a left-hander , fought back to force the third and final set under the sweltering midafternoon sun . Tarango took charge in the third set , opening up a 3-0 lead and cruising from there . " I almost had it in the second , but I kept getting behind and had to keep fighting back , " he said . " I played a really good third set , but I thought I played smart throughout the match . When he came in , I got some good passing shots . " Winning this tournament was the farthest thing from Tarango ' s mind when he arrived for Monday ' s first round . " I was just trying to get to the quarterfinals like last year , " he said . " After the quarters , it was all downhill from there . " Pozzi , who won the Irish Open in 1987 and reached the second round of the Australian Open this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergh on his way to the Winnetka final . " I played very well all week , especially in the early rounds , " he said . " It would have been better with first place , but I thought I played a good tournament . " Each player had trouble with his opponent ' s service . " I think that was because we ' re not used to playing against lefty serves , " Tarango said . " Right-handers hate to play against lefties , but lefties hate to play against lefties even more because you never play against them . Everybody else is always playing you . " Pozzi , who also plans to play in the U.S. Open , gets to keep his $2 , 500 runner-up prize . Acuna and Deppe split the $1 , 500 first prize for their doubles triumph , and Palmer and Sampras divided $750 . CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Greg Tucker .
