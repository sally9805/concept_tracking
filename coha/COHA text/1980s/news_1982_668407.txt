His name is Eddy Folson and he is 32 and he smoked a cigarette in the rain outside the restaurant . His short hair , colored like salt and pepper , curled with dampness at the collar of a thin , cloth coat that was soaked from the sheet of water tumbling from the sky . Inside the restaurant , Eddy Folson ' s wife , Sara , waited to see the manager about a part-time job that had been advertised on a piece of cardboard in thewindow . As small beads of rain trickled down the glass , the husband , a carpenter , kept glancing over his shoulder to see if the wife was making any progress with a man who offered a small particle of hope in a life crushed by unemployment . " When did you get laid off , " Eddy Folson was asked . " July , " he answered . " End of July . " " What have you been doing since then ? " " Driving a cab , " he said . " A little painting with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not working either . The two of us did a couple of houses in September but it ' s getting too cold now . Pretty soon that will be over . We might have some indoor work , though . " This took place Saturday morning . One day earlier , people who work for the most inept President since Hoover announced in Washington that more than 11 million Americans have no work . On that same day , Friday , the stock market broke records and millions were made . In Reagan ' s America , institutions mean more than human beings and the fact that unemployment is higher than at any time since the 1930s had only a positive effect on the money market in New York . As all of this was taking place , the President - fresh from telling some congressional candidate to " shut up , " which was an event cheered and applauded as a sign of courage - was on his way to a brief vacation in California . Saturday , as Eddy Folson stood in the rain , Ronald Reagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the sun giving a radio speech where he called Polish generals " a bunch of lousy bums . " More name-calling and soon everyone will forget that they are being led into the desert by a man without a compass . A guy came out of the restaurant and spotted Eddy Folson . He gave his name as Tommy Condon and reminded Folson that they had worked together up at Seabrook about two summers ago . " Oh yeah , " Folson remembered . " How you been doing ? " " Eehh , " Condon said with a shrug of his shoulders . " You working ? " Folson asked him . " Once in a while , " Tommy Condon said . " There ' s not much around , though . How about you ? " " Nothing with a saw , " Folson said . " So what are you doing here ? " Condon asked . " Waiting for my wife , " Eddy Folson told him . " She ' s inside applying for a job . " " Yeah , " Condon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , I hope she gets it . If she doesn ' t , let me know , will ya ? I ' ll get a dress and apply for it myself . " " You got lousy legs , " Folson said as the two men laughed . With Condon disappearing into the rain , Folson lit another cigarette and nervously paced back and forth beneath the awning that hung from the front of the restaurant . He stopped only when his wife came out of the door . " So ? " he said . " Come back Tuesday , " Sara Folson said . " What ? " " He told me to come back Tuesday , " she repeated . The husband shook his head and tried to smile as his wife put both hands out in front of her , palms up , in a gesture of resignation . While the damp wind swept around them , he placed his arm around her waist and gave her a kiss on the cheek . For eight weeks , Eddy Folson has been one of Reagan ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed by people who can not recall the last time they had a blister not picked up on a golf course . We have a President of the United States who has not worked an honest day ' s job in more than four decades , and yet he continues to offer the ramblings of his old , rich-man ' s mind about how we will all prosper if only he can get his way with Congress . So far , his way has resulted in a blanket being thrown across the able bodies of men and women who need to work , want to work but can find no work . They are all part of an 11 million-member army of the unemployed and that is only official government mathematics . As anyone with common sense knows , the actual number is much higher , perhaps double . Reagan ' s people count only those who volunteer the fact of their joblessness . But there are whole areas of this city , of any city , filled with people who long ago gave up looking . All of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fakes and bumbles his way through one term in the White House .
