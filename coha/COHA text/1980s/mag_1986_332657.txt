Politicians will go to remarkable lengths to get the attention of voters , but Arizona 's Democratic Governor Bruce Babbitt outdid even the most tireless baby kisser and hand shaker last week . From Sunday to Saturday , he bicycled across 397 miles of Iowa , pausing only for an emergency trip to Phoenix to attend the funeral of a legislative ally . " They told me this state was flat , " mumbled the tall , lean presidential hopeful , as he and his wife Hattie forced their Schwinns up a series of long , steep hills . Following along in an air- conditioned camper , Babbitt 's two sons good naturedly egged him on . " There are 7,500 people on this ride , Dad , " said Christopher , 10 . " But there 's only one who has to make it to the finish . " <P> Avid bicyclists enter the Des Moines Register 's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa , better known as " Ragbrai , " to enjoy Iowa hospitality , 10 cents lemonade , and the excellent local bratwurst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucuses are the first major test of the 1988 presidential campaign . The Arizona Governor , whose successes are little known east of the Rocky Mountain states , needs all the early recognition he can get . <P> Yet in spite of his low national profile , Babbitt has begun to stir interest with his impressive record as a two-term Governor and his provocative ideas about national policy and the future of the Democratic Party . " There are two Democratic Parties , " Babbitt declared at a hog roast in Red Oak . " One is our national Democratic Party , which has lost four of the last five presidential elections by increasing margins . The other Democratic Party has won 34 of the governorships and control of a majority of the state legislatures and county commissions . One party is failing . The other is a winner . " <P> Babbitt 's politics are difficult to label , which could be a virtue for a Democrat seeking national office these days . When he called out the National Guard to quell a violent 1983 contract dispute in Arizona 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a closet Republican . A critic of government entitlement programs spawned by Democratic lawmakers , Babbitt proposes that most government benefits , from Social Security to farm subsidies , be " means tested . " That idea , even when coupled with a pledge of support for the family farm , did not endear Babbitt to some of Iowa 's hard-pressed growers , whose middle-class life-styles depend on government subsidies . Said one , Jon Malloy of Essex : " I 'm impressed with his intelligence and his ideas , but I 'm not comfortable that he would give us the help we need right now . " <P> Babbitt would not use the money saved from slashing benefits for the wealthy and middle classes to cut the federal budget . Instead , he would increase benefits for the poor . Yet this liberal-sounding proposition belies Babbitt 's record of penny-pinching pragmatism in Arizona , where he has worked successfully with business and with the Republicans who control the legislature and where state spending is lower as a proportion of personal income than when he took office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
