" It ' s the street dessert of the year , " according to Mimi Sheraton of the New York Times . And " the hottest item in New York this summer , " in the opinion of the Daily News . The Chipwich has chocolate or vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies , the edge of which is covered by chocolate chips . It costs a dollar and has become a noontime staple for many New Yorkers. // Richard LaMotta , founder and inventor of the Chipwich and now chairman of the board , was a self-confessed " dunker " ( of cookies in milk ) , obsessed with finding the perfect combination of chocolate chip cookies and ice cream . As he quickly discovered , it was not an easy job , as there are problems of melting ice cream , soggy cookies cyrstallization , and maintaining its freshness overnight . His search for the finest cookies , ice cream , and chips was to last 5 1/2 years. // Not that Mr. LaMotta needed to keep busy . He was an engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law practice , and was a partner in an ice cream parlor in New Jersey . That parlor was to become his laboratory. // When the then unnamed product made its debut there , Mr. LaMotta held a contest for its name . Six thousand children entered it , and two came up with the name Chipwich . The name stuck and was trademarked here and in 42 other countries. // The Chipwick took over 25 percent of the store ' s inventory . But the store could not live on Chipwiches alone and soon closed , leaving Mr. LaMotta with a tasty product but no one to eat it. // Mr. LaMotta then entered into an undisclosed contract with Quaker Oats , which producer Burry ' s cookies . The test marketing lasted two years and resulted in an offer to buy the product for almost a million dollars . Richard LaMotta said no . " I looked at it and said , it ' s not like writing a book which you can sell-cheap and then you write another . I ' ll never dream up another food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll see what I can do if I raise some money. " // The Chipwich attack on New York City was carefully planned . Friends said it was the last place you should bring a new food item . But the LaMotta theory was that New York would indeed be the ultimate challenge and test , and  --  he hoped  --  the ultimate success. // " You know , " Mr. LaMotta says , " If you have a new item you ' ll get a New Yorker one time . I ' m a New Yorker and you ' ll get me once . If it ' s garbage , I ' m not coming back . So I just put myself in the position of a buyer of my product . I ' ll make it pleasant , clean , and I ' ll get them the first time . It ' s a chic , sophisticated audience . You can ' t pull the wool over a New Yorker ' s eyes. " // So Mr. LaMotta went for a classy look in a verding cart  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s . The street debut of the Chipwich  --  shinny carts , uniforms  --  was costly but worth it. // The San Gennaro Street festival in September 1980 was a " monster success . " Although the festival attracted a typical pastry-eating crowd , four vendors sold 16 , 000 pieces in 10 days . At the Third Avenue festival two carts sold 1 , 000 in one hour . At the Kentucky Derby , it was 20 , 000 pieces in four hours. // After the May 1 debut , " we became a soldout hit on the streets . We would sell out by 1 or 2 o ' clock . Sold everything I could make in 24 hours. " // National and international requests were also piling in  --  everything from corporate office party orders to hotels and airlines . The Chipwich will be all over the United States in about 14 months . New York supermarkets will carry Chipwiches in packets of three this fall . Boston should see the Chipwich carts next spring , while warmer areas of the country will taste them sooner. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. LaMotta says today . " We ' ve been successful , we want to pick people who would keep the style and integrity of the product . That word integrity  --  a lot of people have forgotten it. " // The person-to-Chipwich contact is still made on the street by a group of singing , bell-ringing people who wear safari hats , aprons , and bow ties under a chocolate chip cookie umbrella. // " We hire maybe one applicant out of 20 , " Mr. LaMotta says . " We ' re looking for personality . Your size , shape , color , nothing matters except your personality and your willingness to want to go out there and hustle , work , and be personable . It ' s like a big family. " // The day-to-day operation starts with groups of 15 salespeople meeting their managers in specially designated areas of the city . There they are given their cart and Chipwiches . Even their nails are checked . During the day , the manager allows them lunch and regular breaks . Later he makes sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out. // A lot of the Chipwich ' s success can be traced to LaMotta ' s childhood . " I remember when I was a kid  --  the Chunky bar , they gave you a lot . I got my money ' s worth. the Haagen-Dazs quality of ice cream also inspired me . You eat a Chipwich and you know you ' ve had something of quality . I could have saved a lot of money using emulsified and not imported chocolate chips and less than a quality bakery cookie , but I don ' t want my name associated with something that isn ' t quality. // " You want to believe that you are working hard and that you can get an opportunity , find a niche  --  you can make it . In my case , it ' s sort of semiproof that it does happen. " // Mr. LaMotta could now probably sit back in his niche and watch the world eat Chipwiches . But since he feels he has gotten a lot out of the system , he tries to give some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping them along. // " Somebody may come to me with the weirdest idea in the world and I may not be interested , but boy I love to see that , " he says . " I sit with him and say , Hey , did you ever think of this and this ? I offer him whatever advice I can give him , or give him the righht direction . You ' ve got to help other people go out there and do it . If you can lessen someone ' s heartaches in life just a little bit , then you ' ve done something nice. " // For enterprising business people , he offers some heartfelt advice : // " Do it , don ' t be afraid to give it your best shot . Don ' t be afraid of what the other people say as long as you can believe in your integrity . If you believe in what you have and can honestly say to yourself , I have something really fine , then get out there and believe it and sell it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // //
