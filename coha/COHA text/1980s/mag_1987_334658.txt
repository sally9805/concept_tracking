At a screening of a porn film , a female critic spotted something in the movie that offended her sensibilities . " Good grief ! " she exclaimed , rising from her seat as bodies heaved onscreen . " Just look at those dirty sheets ! " <P> That incident may not go down in history as a turning point in the fortunes of porn . On the other hand , maybe it will . Steffani Martin , who was one of five females among the 30 viewers at the screening that day in Manhattan , says it was a good example of the new female consciousness breaking in on the crude male world of pornography . Says Martin , now head of Womero , an X-rated film distributorship in New York City : " The female consumer is beginning to change porn films . She wo n't tolerate dirty sheets , low production values and creepy male actors with 37 gold chains around their necks . Women want cute guys who talk like real people and sex with some class . " <P> Like the rough frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolmarms from back East , the porn industry ( estimated annual U.S. sales : $8 billion ) is beginning to reshape itself to accommodate women . The pressure is largely an unforeseen by-product of the VCR revolution . Males who once trekked to sleazy inner-city theaters began to take porn videotapes home . Wives and lovers started to make their opinions felt , and their voices began to affect the market . <P> One lesson learned by the porn industry is that traditional female repugnance to porn can melt when the product is cleaned up a bit and presented at home , where the woman can feel safe and treat the movie as a prelude to lovemaking . Women account for perhaps 40% of the estimated 100 million rentals of X-rated tapes each year . " The VCR put porno where it belongs : in people 's bedrooms , " says an executive vice president for one porn house , Essex Productions of Chatsworth , Calif . " I never felt it belonged in theaters . People feel that in the comfort of their own homes , they are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , porn theaters and other sex emporiums  --  bookstores , peep shows and strip joints  --  have fallen on hard times . Manhattan had 121 such outlets a decade ago . Now there are only 42 in all of New York City , and more are likely to close if the city moves ahead with its Times Square redevelopment . There are now about 350 porn theaters in the U.S. , half the number of a decade ago . The remaining theaters have trouble getting new X- rated fare , since many , perhaps most , " dirty " films are now shot on videotape and can not be projected clearly on theater screens . <P> Sex magazines are declining too , under pressure from the Meese commission , churches , feminists and the easy availability of sex tapes . Says Detective Don Smith of the Los Angeles police department : " All the people now in video were making 8 mm or were in magazines . We 're talking the same players ; we 're just seeing a change in the industry . " The customer who can not buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go next door and rent Oriental Lesbian Fantasies for the same price or less . And he may never go back to Playboy . Says veteran Pornographer Al Goldstein : " There 's no way a magazine can compete with a tape when it comes to fantasy . "
