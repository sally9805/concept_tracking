Everyone else has a new look for the ' 80s , so why not the nation 's 4 million Boy Scouts ? And who better to fashion a contemporary look than Couturier Oscar de la Renta ? Displayed in New York last week , the de la Renta uniforms were indeed eye-catching . So was Jerry Hall , blond friend of Rock Singer Mick Jagger , who modeled a den-mother outfit that was guaranteed to persuade young men to sign up for adoption , if not Scouting . <P> <P> Misha , the Moscow mascot of the Summer Olympics , has been shaken by Jimmy Carter 's Olympic boycott , and so has the NBC peacock . Now the shock waves have reached Postmaster General William F. Bolger , who last week withdrew all U.S. Olympic commemorative stamps , postcards and envelopes from the market " in support of national policy . " Will the Olympic issues become hot collector 's items like the 1918 upside-down airmail stamp , or even the less exotic 5 1967 American Space Twins issue , which still commands $10 for a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps were sent to post offices last fall . To reckon their value , philatelic enthusiasts will have to determine how many were sold , saved , licked or lost before Bolger halted sales . <P> <P> W. Averell Harriman was once known in Washington , more or less affectionately , as " the Crocodile " for his deceptively sleepy-looking gaze and sharp bite . He is 88 now . Henry Cabot Lodge is 77 . Last week in Boston , the World Affairs Council , honoring Democrat Harriman for long and distinguished diplomatic service , asked Republican Lodge to present the award . The two have compiled more than 90 years of public service-including Harriman 's stints as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Britain and Lodge 's tours as envoy to South Viet Nam and West Germany . In his acceptance speech , the Crocodile showed plenty of the old snap . He called Americans " too arrogant " about smaller nations , demanded more freedom for the CIA and lamented the end of the draft as " one of the great casualties of the Viet Nam War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bolsheviks " determined to subjugate the sturdy people of Afghanistan . <P> <P> It 's not that Londoners do n't want a half-ton , half-heroic bronze of British-born Comedian Charlie Chaplin in Leicester Square . After all , Will Shakespeare already stands there , although the Bard 's appearance and dignity have been besmirched by pigeons , air pollution and porno spreading through a once tony neighborhood that used to be home to Painters William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds . But installation of the statue of the Little Tramp , who died at 88 in 1977 , has been stalled by a standoff between the Greater London Council , which wants to rehabilitate the square speedily , and the more snail-paced local Westminster Council , which objects to the statue on aesthetic grounds . So six months after he was cast , Chaplin still stands , replete with crooked cane , cockeyed derby , sagging frock coat , baggy pants and oversize shoes , in the studio of Sculptor John Doubleday , 33 . It was a bureaucratic impasse that the maker of Modern Times would have relished . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
