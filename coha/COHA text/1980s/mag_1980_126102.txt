The crowd of robust young men jostled for position in front of the six-foot color television screen , downing beers from 62-ounce pitchers at a relentless **25;609;TOOLONG clip , commenting with inspired vulgarity on the action before them . " Hey , Rizzo 's got the ball . Rizzo ! Oh , what moves that mother has .... " All in all , a typical weekend scene at the neighborhood tavern : a bunch of guys having a few beers and watching a game on the tube . Almost , but not quite , because these particular guys , members of the Santa Barbara , Calif. , Grunions rugby team , were watching themselves play in a game videotaped that afternoon and shown that evening at Clyde Bennett 's Instant Replay bar and grill . The big Rizzo fan was , in fact , Frank Rizzo himself , who is captain of the Grunions . Rizzo , like most Instant Replay patrons , was simply carried away by the sight of himself on TV . It was an exercise in narcissism made possible by a television crew consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's principal occupation is teaching physical education at the Montecito Union Elementary School , he has been operating the Instant Replay since April 22 . His inspiration came from 15 years of playing and umpiring in Santa Barbara 's vast city recreation program . Bennett observed that weekend jocks such as himself do pretty much the same thing after every game : they go someplace to drink beer , watch a little TV and endlessly rehash the activities of the day . He also became aware of another quirk of human nature : people get a big kick out of seeing themselves on television . The seeds of a big idea were germinating. // Digging into his savings , Bennett bought $6,000 worth of television equipment , including a camera with a zoom lens and a videotape machine . He knew he wanted to film his fellow softballers in action , but he did n't know where he could show the tapes . Should he charge admission ? Should he be compensated for his expenditures or should he merely consider the whole endeavor a terribly expensive hobby ? It was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the postgame ritual . Bennett decided to become a publican . He searched Santa Barbara for available property and finally settled on a rundown former hippie bar at 33 West Anapamu Street . The Bennetts were n't deep in capital  --  " We depleted our savings to buy this place , " says Bennett 's wife , Oleta  --  so the Instant Replay became pretty much a family operation . All of the Bennetts  --  daughters Anne , 22 , and Laura , 14 , and son , Mark , 18  --  work there , dishing up hamburgers , pouring wine and beer and helping Bennett film his games . // The place was packed beyond its 65-seat capacity on opening night , when the feature film was a women 's softball game played the previous weekend , and it remained filled throughout the summer when , on a given night , players from as many as six softball teams could see themselves in action . " Softball is our bread and butter , " says Bennett , but his camera was soon focused on other events in sports-mad Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if the participants are up to buying a few beers afterward. // " My basic idea is that this is advertising , " says Bennett of his gimmick . " We have the understanding that if I film the players , they 'll come in to watch . After all , any bar can show NFL games or baseball 's Game of the Week . We show those , too , but the thing here is seeing yourself . " In a remarkably short time , the Instant Replay became a Santa Barbara institution , and word of Bennett 's genius soon spread beyond the city limits , particularly after the bar was featured on an NBC newscast . " I 've had calls from all over the country from people wanting to copy the idea , " says Bennett . " And I do n't suppose there 's any way I can stop them from doing it . " // Indeed , there is every possibility that the tavern industry will soon be inundated with imitation Instant Replays . Even the most diehard fan might be prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing himself throw a game-winning pass in the neighborhood touch football league . Still , it 's questionable if an operation as extensive as Bennett 's could succeed anywhere outside of Santa Barbara . This lovely beach community of about 74,000 active and mostly affluent souls is what every Easterner seems to think all California is like . The sun , save for some early morning fog , shines benevolently on thousands of lean , tanned and partially dressed young men and women whose dedication to semi-nudity is such that auslanders in long pants are looked upon as fetishists . Even the city 's old folks  --  and their number is considerable  --  faithfully observe the rules of dishabille. // Everyone , young and old , rich and middle-class , does something physical . This includes all the usual sports , plus local favorites like two-man beach volleyball and over-the-line , a form of three-to-a-team beach softball . Nobody in Santa Barbara even seems to walk much . The citizens propel themselves along the oceanside thoroughfares on roller skates , bicycles and skateboards , and there seem to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . The waves are alive with surfers and the pools with swimmers. // Santa Barbara and the Instant Replay were made for each other , and Bennett 's was an idea whose time had come . " We cover every sport , every age group , " says Oleta . " Between Clyde and Mark , they know every jock in town . " Just keeping up with what 's going on has Bennett hopping , but besides his camera work , bar-keeping and schoolteaching , he 's also the city 's chief official for softball and basketball . On any one weekend , Bennett might umpire as many as 15 softball games . Fortunately , he 's indefatigable , unflappable and doggedly good-humored. // One Friday not long ago , Bennett , wearing his yellow Instant Replay sports shirt and checkered slacks , popped into his bar-restaurant shortly after 10 in the morning . At noon , he would be showing a videotape of the dramatic semifinal game in the women 's city soccer tournament . At two , he would be taping the Santa Barbara Invitational Triples Lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice game between players from the Grunions and U.C.- Santa Barbara . After that , it would be back to the bar for the rugby telecast . The next day , he would umpire five softball games in Ojai , 35 miles east of Santa Barbara , while Mark stayed in town to videotape the women 's soccer finals between the Sockers and Nick 's Chicks. // " I have fun here , " Bennett said , glancing about his modest establishment . // The Instant Replay , with its red straight-back chairs , large front windows and homey , have-a-hamburger atmosphere , looks more like a lunch counter than a bar , which is the way Bennett wants it . As a schoolteacher he retains a slightly puritanical approach to his new business , preferring to call the Replay a " restaurant , " although the fare is largely limited to hamburgers . He serves only wine and beer , primarily because he thinks male jocks are beer drinkers and female jocks are wine drinkers , but also because he does n't want to assume the responsibility hard liquor involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by mistake , momentarily despoiling the locker-room ambience Bennett so assiduously cultivates. // Such occurrences are rare , however . The Replay is so jockish in conversation , entertainment and decor  --  the walls are adorned with action photographs of myriad Santa Barbara sports events  --  that patrons accustomed to more conventional watering holes become quickly disoriented , especially when they perceive that the game on the back-wall screen is n't the Rams and the Cowboys but the Sockers and Nick 's Chicks. // Or , perhaps even lawn bowlers . On a recent afternoon Bennett packed up his camera and portable tape machine and headed for a tournament at the Santa Barbara Lawn Bowling Club a block away . It was , of course , a sunny day , and the setting was as pastoral and serene as a painting by Renoir . The bowling green was marble smooth and shaded by a profusion of trees  --  palms and eucalypti and a gigantic Moreton Bay fig whose branches spread protectively over the elderly bowlers . The Spanish towers of the old Arlington Theater rose in the distance , framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bowlers wore white , and because many of them were British expatriates , they seemed to have been transported to Santa Barbara from another century . // Into this gauzy scene strode the lantern-jawed Bennett in his yellow shirt , camera perched on his shoulder , bustling among the bowlers as if he were filming the Game of the Week . He was , predictably , the object of much curiosity . " You mean he 's photographing us for television ? " a woman in an umbrella hat inquired . " Incredible . " Simply by being there , Bennett was drumming up business for the Replay , although it did occur to him that the elegant old lawn bowlers were hardly the sort of people who would lose an afternoon watching TV in a bar . Still , they were gratified to learn that they could see themselves that very afternoon if they wished , at a place so nearby . " As I understand it , you will give me a replay for a beer , " a gray-haired woman said in a cultivated British accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portly septuagenarian in white shorts and a pith helmet . " I 'm planning to do four hours on lawn bowling , " he said . " These people say they 'll come to watch . " But he knew that lawn bowling was a gamble . Rugby , his subject later in the day , was n't . " I like rugby players because they 're good beer drinkers and they 're big eaters , too . " // Ruggers , softballers , lawn bowlers , women soccer players , volleyballers  --  all come to the Instant Replay , a bar that truly makes a statement on the human condition . " It 's thrilling to see yourself score , " says Replay customer Alissa Arp , a center forward for the Sockers and a graduate student in marine biology at U.C.- Santa Barbara . " I played football through the college level , " says rugger Rizzo , " and we always had films . But they were used so the coaches could get on you . Here , you just have a few beers and enjoy yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and there 's nobody to get on you . " // So far the Bennetts have n't gotten rich operating their unusual tavern , but they 're staying afloat and they 're having as much fun , for all of the labor , as their customers . " Basically , we 're an athletic family , a crazy family , not a normal family , " says Oleta , who quit her job as a counselor for the Santa Barbara County Probation Department to help out at the Replay . " I listen to the conversations in here , and it seems to me that a lot of these jocks ca n't really have a close relationship with one another except through sports . They rarely look deeply into themselves . Maybe that 's why they like to see themselves up there . " // Non-jocks have also tried to get in on Bennett 's act . He did agree to tape a rock concert rehearsal and he has filmed a wedding reception that was held , conveniently , in the Replay , but he rejected a suggestion from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . These are mere aberrations , though . Bennett holds firm to his original scheme . " This , " he says , with determination , " is a jock bar . " // Bennett enjoys telling of the night an attractive young woman dropped in , obviously noticing that the Replay was populated with fit young men . She sat unattended at the bar as , to her amazement , the men spent their time shouting at their images on the screen . After some minutes of this , she turned to Bennett and asked , " Say , what kind of a place is this , anyway ? " She could n't have known what a good question that was .
