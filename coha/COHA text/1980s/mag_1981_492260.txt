There 's likely to be a home computer in your future . New home computers are get  --  ting cheaper , getting smaller , doing more . They can help you plan budgets , menus and kitchen inventories . They can serve as electronic games , record tax deductions and balance checking accounts . They can do wonders to motivate children . They can turn homework into home fun . We 're told they can remind you of dentist appoint  --  ments and dance lessons and store the kids ' vaccination records safely . But if you 're like most of the over-30 age group , you 've probably resisted learning " computer talk . " When the young people throw around vocabularies like " FORTRAN " and " COBOL , " you turn off . " Enough , " you say . " I did n't grow up with computers like you did . I 've learned enough new technology to last my lifetime . " The Post editors begin in this issue an easy primer of home computer talk and computer lore . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fascinating world of terminals and easy ac  --  cess . Computers work with data in the form of numbers . Man has also been concerned with data in the form of the spoken word or the recorded message . The send  --  ing of these messages , the record ing of information in a book , the - addition and subtraction and sort ing of numbers are examples of / information processing . - -7 The very first way man add ed was using his fingers and toes . He then began to use pebbles and sticks for larger numbers . Soon man began to use other tools for his arithmetic prob  --  lems , such as the abacus . Computers are machines that handle data ( facts and figures ) in the form of numbers . From the beginning of time , man has been concerned with the problems of computing . Why is the computer a useful machine ? * It works with incredible speed . A computer can perform a million or more operations in a single second . In one hour a computer can perform more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pen and paper . * A computer has perma  --  nent memory . It can remem  --  ber both facts and instruc  --  tions . These instructions and facts are stored electrically and can be recalled for use in a very short in terval of time . * Computers are very accurate and fast and work precisely . If they are given the cor  --  rect information , they work on this informa  --  tion according to set rules given to them by man . * Computers work automatically . Since computers can remember instructions , they do not have to be told what to do every second . Once the computer has been in  --  structed on what to do , it will execute these instructions until it is told to stop or until it runs out of data to work on . Just like a light with a switch , the computer will stay on un  --  til turned off . We can think of the computer as con  --  sisting of five main parts which all work together as have a means of getting data into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Input Device . " " Memory " is the part which holds the data for us until we are ready to use it . The place where arithmetic is done or logical decisions are made is called the ' Arith  --  metic and Logic Section . " The " Control Section " directs all operations of the other parts of the computer . Finally , a computer has to make the answers available to us through an " Output Device . " Input Unit Input is usually described as information that is transferred from the outside to the inside of a computer for the purpose of processing . A computer 's input device can be a typewriter or a keyboard and a screen attached to the computer . The screen is " called a Cathode Ray Tube ( CRT ) . The computer can also read certain marks and figures written in a special way or with a special ink . The input may also consist of holes punched in cards or paper tape . These holes are sensed by a ray of light or by tiny metal brushes which convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses transmit the data or information to the memory . Memory Unit The memory unit is the part of the com  --  puter system where the data is stored . The memory receives this data from the input unit . The data that is sent to the memory is kept there until it is needed by other parts of the computer . The storage or memory section can be visualized as a large box divided into com  --  partments , each box containing data . All data is placed in storage before it is proc  --  essed by the computer . The computer re  --  members  --  that is , it stores in its memory  --  the data received from the input unit and the information that it has received during its operation . The size or capacity of the storage unit determines the amount of information that can be held within the computer at any one time . The stored data can be found easily by the computer because each location , position or section of storage is numbered . Instructions and data which are required by the computer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are identified by an individually numbered location called an " address . " Arithmetic and Logic Unit The purpose of the arithmetic and logic unit is to perform all of the computer 's arithmetical and logical operations . The operations of addition , subtraction , multiplication , division and comparing are carried out in this unit . Complex calcula  --  tions are combinations of basic operations and follow a sequence of instructions . The number of instructions required for the solution of a problem varies depending upon the problem . The arithmetic and logic unit receives its input from the storage unit and , after car rying out the appropriate calculations , sends the answer back to the storage unit ready for use when it is needed . Control Unit The control unit conducts the traffic in and out of the four parts of the computer : Input , Memory , Arithmetic and Output . The electronic impulses from the other computer segments are sent to their nec  --  essary units by the control unit . An elec  --  tronic timing device , really a clock , reg  --  ulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when data is read into the com puter , the control unit will direct it to the storage unit until it is needed . Output Unit The output unit of a computer is often the same unit as that used for input . The output may be information on punched cards , punched tape or magnetic tape . The output also may be typed out on an automatic typewriter or shown on a cathode ray tube ( TV-like screen ) . Many of the large com  --  puters have printing attachments . Output is usually described as informa  --  tion that has already been processed . The part of the computer that does the process  --  ing is called the Central Processing Unit ( CPU ) . This consists of the memory , control and arithmetic units . Output devices in  --  clude the card punch , magnetic tape drive , magnetic disk drive , teletypewriter , high  --  speed printer , cathode ray tube terminal and plotter . In our communications with the com  --  puter , unlike with people , precise instruc  --  tions must be used according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the computer , we must carefully think through what we have to do . The ordering of our thoughts is called preparing an algorithm . An algorithm is the step-by-step pro  --  cedure for accomplishing a given task . Since the presentation of the data must becarefully prepared , we must specify the sequence of successive operations to be followed in a particular order  --  the job of a skilled man or woman known as a computer programmer . Using words and symbols , we can make a computer language easy for people to ac  --  cept and understand . The symbols are ar  --  ranged according to certain rules ( gram  --  mar ) . As languages differ among nations , each computer has its own special language . We call this the machine language of the computer . This language allows the five elements of the computer system to communicate with each other . Machine language is very in  --  volved and cumbersome . As computer technology developed , other languages were developed in order to make com  --  munication with the computer , as well as between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages used today are : COBOL ( COmmon Business-Oriented Language ) , FORTRAN ( FORmula TRANslator ) and BASIC ( Beginner 's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) . These languages allow computers to work for us in a variety of ways . Communication The telephone industry is also a very ac  --  tive computer user . Telephone companies use the computer to compute local and long-distance charges . In addition , com  --  puters are now used to enable operators to locate numbers rapidly and efficiently . Medicine The increasing requirements of the health sciences , both in application and research , have brought about computerization in medicine . In areas such as gathering medical records and administrative data and monitoring patients , the computer has helped to reduce the chance of human error . In the field of medical research , the computer provides the accuracy and preci  --  sion necessary for compiling statistics on diseases and for simulating human func  --  tions . Computers are also valuable for their speed in diagnosing illness and determin  --  ing treatment . Newspapers The newspaper industry was one of the far-sighted users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1960s . Law Enforcement The area of law enforcement has greatly profited by being able to rapidly retrieve information pertaining to various criminal activities such as identifying the driver of a stolen car , the right to have a weapon , fin  --  gerprint identification and arrest records . The FBI has set up a National Crime In  --  formation Center in Washington , D.C. Here , stored in a vast computer complex , isa file of individuals wanted by police authorities throughout the nation . Banking and Credit The special numbering system printed on a check , which identifies a depositor 's ac  --  count , has saved the banks countless man  --  ual working hours . The banks use special sorting machines to read the magnetic ink numbers at the bottom left side of a check . Postal System While the postal service is working on various methods to help in the cumbersome activities of mail sorting , some computer equipment used to weigh packages is already in use in some of our large post of fices . Transportation Computers have been programmed to produce cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , trim and type of special equipment . The airline industry also must handle large quantities of data in order to give the public the service it demands . The main functions of the computer system include : 1 ) passenger reservations ; 2 ) cargo schedules ; 3 ) operations control ; and 4 ) the more conventional uses of data processing , such as payrolls , ac  --  counting , inventory control and purchas  --  ing . The great railroad companies such as ? , . Amtrak use computers to route trains on ' tracks throughout the nation today . These computers are constantly monitored by a control supervisor should a manual in  --  tervention be necessary . Aerospace Industry Without the use of computers , our scien  --  tists could never have launched missiles , reports could not have been sent back to earth regarding the various experiments carried out on the lunar missions and astronauts would never have been sent to the moon . Pollution Control At the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado , computers are used to monitor and to study pollution factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the computer . The timers of football , hockey and basketball games are computer controlled . Education A computer-taught independent study program makes use of audio-visual teach ing machines . Each student is able to com  --  municate with the computer via a type  --  writer-like keyboard and can keep track of his progress . This allows an individual to learn material at his own pace . As the 18th and 19th centuries were eras of tremendous industrial growth , so the 20th century is viewed as an electronic age  --  a time when developments in elec  --  tronics are propelling computers to un  --  foreseen applications . Here our creativity is being realized . We might now ask our  --  selves , " What will the 21st century bring to the wonderful world of computers ? " On the other hand , it might be better to ask , " What will computerization bring to our world in the 21st century ? " One thing is certain : Computers are here to stay . The Post will show you how to deal with the computer in your future when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
