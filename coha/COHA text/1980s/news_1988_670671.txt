In New York City , a great majority of whites and a plurality of blacks also said the advisers were lying in their account alleging abduction and rape by white men in Dutchess County last November , the poll showed. // The pattern of expressed disbelief and hostility was even stronger in interviews conducted in the area of Wappingers Falls , N.Y. , where Miss Brawley lives . In that region , where the black population is about 6 percent , not enough blacks were surveyed to allow their views to be differentiated with statistical confidence . <> <> Shift in Attitudes // The three advisers - the Rev. Al Sharpton , and the lawyers Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason , who have counseled the black schoolgirl not to cooperate with the authorities - are widely viewed unfavorably by both blacks and whites , a sharp shift in attitudes among blacks since January , the survey shows. // Governor Cuomo , by contrast , has increased his favorable rating and another frequent target of the Brawley advisers , the state ' s Attorney General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so among blacks. // Seven months into the convoluted mystery and amid a perplexing rash of disclosures , the poll found continued widespread pessimism over race relations and leadership to resolve conflicts. // Moreover , a third of the New York City whites , a sixth of city blacks and nearly half of the Wappingers Falls area respondents said they thought the Brawley case would damage race relations in the long run . Even so , the survey found some perception of improvements over the last six months in perceptions of how well blacks and whites get along with each other in the city. // The telephone poll , of 1 , 131 adults - 676 in New York City and 455 in the Wappingers Falls , Poughkeepsie and Newburgh area where the case is centered - was conducted last Tuesday to Saturday . The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points for the New York City total , plus or minus five points in the Wappingers Falls area , and plus or minus six for whites or blacks in New York City. // Blacks in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the survey was weighted so results would reflect the actual proportion of whites and blacks in the city . The survey was substantially completed before Saturday ' s developments involving a new figure in the case , Samuel M. McClease , a self-described surveillance expert . Last week , Mr. McClease claimed that at Mr. Sharpton ' s direction , he had secretly tape-recorded the Brawley advisers casting doubt on their own public version of events . Mr. Sharpton denied any involvement . <> <> Blank Tapes // By the end of the week , Mr. McClease had been arrested and charged with perjury and obstruction of justice after tapes he turned over to Federal prosecutors turned out to be blank. // Reinterviews Sunday with about 100 of the respondents who had originally been critical of the advisers showed a slight movement , particularly among blacks , away from statements that the advisers had been lying . There was no change in the overall favorable/unfavorable opinion ratings of the advisers , and it appeared that the charge against Mr. McClease had not affected the basic findings of the survey. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents were asked : // " Some people say the Brawley family advisers are telling the truth about what they think happened to Tawana Brawley , and other people think they are lying . Do you think they are telling the truth about what they think happened to Tawana Brawley , or are they lying ? " // Among whites in the city , 9 percent said the advisers were telling the truth , 71 percent said they were lying and 20 percent had no answer . Among blacks , 28 percent said they were telling the truth and 37 percent said they were lying , while 35 percent had no opinion . <> <> Questions About Advisers // When respondents were asked to judge whether various figures had handled the Brawley case responsibly or not responsibly , 62 percent of New York City blacks polled said Miss Brawley ' s advisers had not acted responsibly ; 17 percent said responsibly . The remainder said they did not know or declined to answer. // For whites in the city , the answer was more lopsided : 83 percent said not responsibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , Glenda , was also widely seen as not acting responsibly : 57 percent of New York City blacks offered that judgment ; 21 percent said the opposite . Whites said , by 85 percent to 6 percent , that she had not acted responsibly. // For more than two weeks , Mrs. Brawley has been taking sanctuary in Queens and Brooklyn churches in evasion of a State Supreme Court order for her arrest to serve a 30-day jail sentence for refusing to explain her defiance of a grand jury subpoena compelling her testimony about her daughter ' s disappearance from last Nov. 24 through 28 . <> <> Penalties for Refusal // A substantial majority of both whites and blacks in New York City and those interviewed upstate said they thought Mrs. Brawley should testify . Asked , however , whether she should go to jail for refusing to testify , blacks and whites split . A majority of whites said yes , while blacks were divided , with 30 percent saying she should be jailed , 25 percent saying she should not. // Because Miss Brawley gave only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family broke off contact with the authorities , her version of events is not clear . Local police officers said she conveyed to them , through nods , gestures and sounds , that she had been abducted by white men and sexually molested. // Her family and advisers have repeatedly said she was raped and sodomized by a group of white men and , without giving evidence , have named three Dutchess County law-enforcement officers as among the perpetrators . Federal and state officials say there is nothing to corroborate the accusations. // Asked what they thought the advisers were trying to accomplish , most whites - 84 percent - and more than half of the New York City blacks - 55 percent - said the advisers were " using the case for personal advantage . " But in other questions , 25 percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites said the advisers were " trying to do the best thing for Miss Brawley " and 25 percent of blacks and 19 percent of whites said they were " trying to reform the criminal-justice system in New York. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was favorable or unfavorable , blacks and whites gave lopsidedly unfavorable ratings to the three advisers . In the highest approval rating , 19 percent of blacks said they had a favorable view of Mr. Mason ; 29 percent said they viewed him unfavorably . As for Mr. Sharpton , 55 percent of blacks gave him an unfavorable rating. // In a similar survey in January , as the Brawley case was just gaining attention , blacks had given all three advisers more favorable than unfavorable ratings , though the total having opinions was much lower than it was in the new poll. // In this survey , among whites in New York City , only 1 percent said they viewed Mr. Sharpton favorably , and 83 percent said they had an unfavorable view . For the city as a whole , his rating was 4 percent favorable and 73 percent unfavorable . In the Wappingers Falls area , it was 1 percent favorable and 86 percent unfavorable. // Mr. Abrams , frequently a target of the advisers , won a favorable rating from 51 percent of whites in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent undecided or not responding . Among blacks , however , it was close to a tossup : 19 percent favorable , 16 percent unfavorable and 64 percent undecided or not responding . <> <> Course of Race Relations // Because Mr. Abrams did not enter the case as special prosecutor until February , there was no basis of comparison with earlier ratings. // A majority of blacks and whites called race relations in the city today " generally bad " with blacks rating them somewhat worse . But the figures showed no appreciable worsening since a poll taken in January. // A slight majority of both groups also said race relations had worsened since a year ago , repeating a similar answer of five months before. // Whites and blacks reacted as virtual mirror opposites to the questions of whether a special prosecutor should be named to supercede local authorities in investigating all cases of racial violence . Blacks favored a special prosecutor over a local prosecutor , 54 to 24 percent . Whites favored the local prosecutor over a special prosecutor , 50 to 28 percent. // The survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the criminal-justice system . More than twice as many whites as blacks said the police treated both races fairly . By the same margin , blacks said whites were favored by the police . Both groups have similarly disparate views of the fairness of the courts. // Whites are slightly more sanguine now about the fairness of the system than they were in January . The views of blacks have shifted insignificantly. // The survey found that significant numbers of blacks and whites say they perceive racial animosities : 53 percent of the city ' s whites and 39 percent of blacks said many or most blacks dislike whites . Thirty-three percent of whites and 36 percent of blacks said many or most whites dislike blacks . <> <> Issues of Race Relations <> <> Do you think race relations in New York today are generally good or generally bad ? **22;101117; <> **44;101141; **44;101187; **44;101233; **44;101279; <> **76;101325; <> **26;101403; New <> <> **76;101431; <> **26;101509; York City <> <> **76;101537; <> **26;101615; total <> **26;101643; Whites <> **26;101671; Blacks <> <> **76;101699; <> Generally good <> **26;101777; 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally bad <> **26;101939; 59 <> <> **76;101967; <> * <> **26;102045; 55 <> <> **76;102073; <> * <> **26;102151; 66 <> <> **76;102179; <> * <> <> **76;102257; <> Don ' t know/no answer <> **26;102335; 11 <> <> **76;102363; <> * <> **26;102441; 11 <> <> **76;102469; <> * <> **26;102547; 11 <> <> **76;102575; <> * <> <> **76;102653; <> <> <> **76;102731; <> Are race relations better , worse , or the same as they were one year ago ? <> <> **76;102809; <> Better <> **26;102887; 9 <> <> **76;102915; <> * <> **26;102993; 8 <> <> **76;103021; <> * <> **26;103099; 12 <> <> **76;103127; <> * <> **26;103205; <> **76;103233; <> Worse <> **26;103311; 53 <> <> **76;103339; <> * <> **26;103417; 51 <> <> **76;103445; <> * <> **26;103523; 56 <> <> **76;103551; <> * <> <> **76;103629; <> Same <> **26;103707; 35 <> <> **76;103735; <> * <> **26;103813; 39 <> <> **76;103841; <> * <> **26;103919; 29 <> <> **76;103947; <> * <> <> **76;104025; <> Don ' t know/no answer <> **26;104103; 3 <> <> **76;104131; <> * <> **26;104209; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> **76;104343; <> * <> <> **76;104421; <> <> <> **76;104499; <> Should a special prosecutor be appointed by the state who would investigate and prosecute all cases of racial violence , or should these cases be handled by local prosecuting authorities ? <> <> **76;104577; <> Special prosecutor <> **26;104655; 37 <> <> **76;104683; <> * <> **26;104761; 28 <> <> **76;104789; <> * <> **26;104867; 54 <> <> **76;104895; <> * <> <> **76;104973; <> Local prosecutor <> **26;105051; 42 <> <> **76;105079; <> * <> **26;105157; 50 <> <> **76;105185; <> * <> **26;105263; 24 <> <> **76;105291; <> * <> <> **76;105369; <> Don ' t know/no answer <> **26;105447; 21 <> <> **76;105475; <> * <> **26;105553; 22 <> **26;105581; 22 <> <> **76;105609; <> * <> <> **76;105687; <> <> <> **76;105765; <> Do you think that in the long run , the Tawana Brawley incident will make a difference in relations between blacks and whites , or won ' t it ? <> <> **76;105843; <> Will make difference <> **26;105921; 40 <> <> **76;105949; <> * <> **26;106027; 44 <> <> **76;106055; <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> **76;106239; <> Won ' t make difference <> **26;106317; 50 <> <> **76;106345; <> * <> **26;106423; 47 <> <> **76;106451; <> * <> **26;106529; 60 <> <> **76;106557; <> * <> <> **76;106635; <> Don ' t know/no answer <> **26;106713; 10 <> <> **76;106741; <> * <> **26;106819; 8 <> <> **76;106847; <> * <> **26;106925; 14 <> <> **76;106953; <> * <> <> <> <> <> <> Based on a poll conducted by telephone June 21-25 .

The poll included 676 respondents in New York City and 455 in the area of Wappingers Falls , N.Y. <> <> How the Poll Was Conducted // The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 21-25 with separate samples in New York City and in the area of Wappingers Falls , N.Y. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. // In New York City , 676 adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the city . The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each area was represented in proportion to its population . For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits , permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers . The numbers were screened to limit calls to residences. // Race was determined by asking each respondent a standard survey question about his or her race . To interview a sufficiently large number of black New Yorkers , additional random numbers were also screened to find more respondents of that race . The survey was then weighted so that total results would reflect the actual proportion of whites and blacks in the city ' s population. // Results were also weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough , sex , age and education. // In the upstate sample , 455 adults were interviewed from telephone exchanges within approximately a 10-mile radius of a point in Wappingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller communities in Dutchess , Orange and Ulster Counties . The telephone numbers were drawn in the same way as they were selected in New York City. // In theory , in 19 cases out of 20 , the results based on such samples for New York City will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult New Yorkers . The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger . For either white or black New Yorkers it is plus or minus six percentage points . For residents of the Wappingers Falls area it is five percentage points. // In addition to sampling error , the practical difficulties of conducting any public-opinion survey may introduce other sources of error into the poll. //
