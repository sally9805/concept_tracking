Big Pan Am has n't fared well since U.S. airlines were deregulated in October 1978 . Its deficits have grown in the wake of the new competition , including fare wars , that followed . It has been hurt by changing traffic patterns as passengers bypassed traditional Pan Am gateways , such as Miami and New York . to fly abroad . Its efforts to gain strength in the U.S. by acquiring National Airlines only added to its woes .
