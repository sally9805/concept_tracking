Puffers around the U.S. were intrigued last year when the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company disclosed that it had developed a virtually smokeless cigarette . Now cigarette users can decide whether the product is like the real thing . Last week Reynolds said that beginning Oct. 1 it will test-market its new brand , Premier , in St. Louis , Phoenix and Tucson . The user lights Premier like a regular cigarette , but a carbon element at its tip warms the enclosed tobacco and flavorings rather than burns them . <P> Even though Premier generates less smoke , it has provoked plenty of fire . Health activists , charging that RJR 's Premier is not a tobacco product but a device that introduces the drug nicotine into the body , have urged the Food and Drug Administration to regulate Reynolds ' invention just like any new drug . The Government will decide in December whether Premier 's packaging must bear the Surgeon General 's warning . Smokers may be put off by Premier 's price : 30 cents more a pack than regular brands .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
