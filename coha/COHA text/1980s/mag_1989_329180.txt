Are commercial airliners being maintained properly ? A barrage of questions about passenger-jet safety were raised last week in the midst of the busy summer travel season . The Air Transport Association , an industry trade group , reported that U.S. carriers are facing a serious shortage of mechanics even as demand for them is growing . Meanwhile , as if to point up the understaffing in the hangars , several airlines were forced to abort flights because of mechanical problems : <P>  --  The most frightening accident of the week was reminiscent of the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City , Iowa , caused when the rear engine exploded , cutting the plane 's hydraulic flight controls . On Wednesday the rear engine shattered on a Northwest DC-10 headed for Minneapolis , blasting holes in the engine housing . The plane landed safely in Denver . In the first mishap , the engine was a General Electric model , in the second , a Pratt &; Whitney ; no cause has been determined for either explosion . <P>  --  Another Northwest DC-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls were not working properly . By week 's end many anxious travelers were avoiding bookings on DC-10s . Addressing the fears , Federal Aviation Administrator James Busey maintained that there is no evidence that DC-10s are less safe than other airliners . <P>  --  Other jets came in for their share of problems . A Trump Shuttle 727 skidded to a stop in a shower of sparks at Boston 's Logan Airport after its nose gear failed to drop for landing . An American Airlines 767 flying from Phoenix to Chicago landed in Albuquerque after a valve burst in its hydraulic system . <P> No one was injured in last week 's incidents , but the mechanical glitches renewed concern about whether maintenance crews that are stretched thin can maintain an adequate margin of safety . Not only do federal rules require modifications on thousands of older jets but the airlines are expanding their fleets with new , technically complicated planes . The ATA report , based on a survey of 21 major airlines , found that carriers have been unable to find mechanics for 4,000 vacancies out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applicants for mechanic 's positions is declining .
