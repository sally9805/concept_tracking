From " Manila Clipper , " by Richard Howard , in the Winter 1987 Yale Review , a special issue titled " Encounters . " Richard Howard 's new book of poems , No Traveller , is forthcoming from Knopf . An American writer of stoical bent and belittling straightforwardness had left Manila a few days before I arrived , and after his visit and his pronouncements , Philippine PEN ? which I was visiting on my way to the 1977 PEN Congress in Sydney ? was in a dither . The writer had declared that the members could n't manage English properly , not to say expressively , and they suspected he was right ( certainly they could n't manage English the way he did ) . Still , in a much-scattered country of many languages , English was the literary language they used , the choice they had made , and it seemed hard ? in their avowed ( and castigated ) struggle against a despotic regime ? to acknowledge along with those political difficulties the more intimate defections of which Mr. Gass had left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Filipino writers ? a theater director and a " prose-poet "  - -  in jail , and in this instance such treatment was entirely unwarranted : neither man was political in the least ; indeed , the director was a " harmless faggot aesthete " and the prose-poet had innocently run afoul of the censors but was not corn cerned with " issues . " ( Here everyone giggled , and before you could say Pier Paolo Pasolini , the subject was dropped . ) But might I , that evening , when I would be dining at Malacanang Palace ? might I at least speak to their outward grievances ? At dinner I would be meeting , they said , the regime 's cultural counselor , a young man of attractive aspect and ambiguous affect with regard to writers ( " like someone in Mrs. Mandelstam 's books " ) , and through him I might reach the boss . In such matters , and on such occasions , the boss was Imelda Marcos . At six in the evening , I was admitted to The Palace through the usual series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited in a variety of vestibules , the Aubussons thickening underfoot , while my invitation was checked and matched with my identity ; in the last of these I was joined by the cultural counselor or whatever he was , who explained to me what a hard job it was mediating between Mrs. Marcos and the touchy writers ? he was , however , doing his best : The country had been under martial law six years already , and would be for another three . The assassination of Benign() Aquino would not occur for six years . So a series of routine examinations of my papers seemed hardly excessive , even in the company of this important , and evidently knowledgeable , functionary . We passed through increasingly splendid Spanish decor and reached one of the main salons , I would guess , and there , in the center of a very large , dark room ( only the ceilings , gilded in the Spanish manner , were distinct ) loomed up four gilded bridge chairs , occupied ? it turned out ? by President and Imelda Marcos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of Elvira Madigan . The president vanished as the lights came up , and I was presented ? by her cultural adviser ? to Mrs. Marcos . I recall my disappointment : so blurred and blunted a countenance , so coarsened and , yes , thickened a figure , when I had been led to expect ? whatever it might be that former beauty queens become . The introductions continued , and Imelda Marcos announced that she had enjoyed the film ? it was so refreshing to see a Swedish film which was n't dir-ty . The Tagalog burr or drawl in her voice gave the last two syllables a particular savor . The Swedish ambassador blushed ( as northern folk will do ) and said nothing . As other guests arrived , we waited , in particular for a friend of Mrs. Marcos , a columnist ( " like Suzy ? you know Suzy ? " ) in one of the Marcos papers ; she wrote , I was coached , a lively society piece every day , and was much appreciated for her insolence ? no one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently this guest managed to make her deadline , for she arrived straight from the paper , and we all went " in " to dinner : another vast salon , and a tremendous feast laid out ? it was for the Swedes , of course ? in the manner of a shipboard buffet . Lots of Filipino specialties elaborately distributed on green leaves . Marcos never reappeared . The columnist , vividly dressed and vivacious indeed , opened a conversation about censorship ? after ail , I had murmured that I was on my way to a world congress to discuss the writer 's right to freedom of expression ? by asking if I knew about the old pre-Hayes Office rules of self-censorship in Hollywood , whereby almost any transaction between couples could be shown on screen so long as both parties had one foot on the floor . " No , I had never heard of such a thing , we marveled together , the table marveled with us , in the heart of porn-free Manila . And then Mrs. Marcos spoke . She had been staring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banquo , and she said , in a reverie that was quite consciously comical : " But suppose ? suppose they were doing it on the floor ? " Except for Napoleon 's saying that to be believed you must make truth unbelievable , I have never known dictators to make jokes ? and good jokes ! It took some time , I recall , for conversation to find its way back ( back ? ) to my purpose , my mission . The columnist asked me ? it might all have been worked out by the counselor and the columnist , they knew the ropes , and the strings , and were pulling them ? asked me what I was doing in the Philippines . And that led to my account of the two unjustly jailed men , the writer and the director . Oh yes , the columnist knew of them , no , she knew them , of course , were they in prison ? whatever for ? they were indeed harmless . " Then let them out ! " Imelda Marcos exclaimed , evidently eager to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I forgot to say we were eating on a gold service , my first experience of that kind ? Mrs. Marcos spoke into it rapidly , forcefully , and the instrument was removed . " You can tell your friends those fellows are free now , " she smiled , and her graciousness was entirely convincing . It had been arranged that I would return to The Palace for one more meeting the following morning . There had been some allusion to meeting the president , but he did not appear . Mrs. Marcos , on this occasion in a very elaborate rainbow gown , took me into the corner of yet another salon , and we sat down a moment together . This was the Heavy Lies the Head moment . From a large receptacle beside her she extracted two large , glossy , illustrated books . " These , " she said , and she put on some gold harlequin glasses to say it , " are President Marcos 's writings , they are studies of Philippine democracy , with outlines of his plans for our people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me sternly through the gold harlequins ? " Marcos is a profound believer in democracy . And I am sure that as the president of American PEN you will be interested in what he has to say . It is not an easy task to protect democracy , and how hard we must work ... " Evidently this was my clue for dismissal , which I seized . After being checked out in the opposite direction , I was released to the purged streets of Manila and my long taxi ride to the airport . I turned over the bright pages of the books Mrs. Marcos had given me : the democratic vistas of Ferdinand Marcos . There she was , beside him , smiling up from my lap into the camera , much less coarse-looking now , much grander than the thickening matron who had so disapproved of Swedish porn . And I thought : Lord , if these people are ever deposed , they can claim to be authors , and PEN will have to defend them ! And I opened the taxi window and flung the ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time . I still wonder if , once the plane was past Mindanao , those two men were clapped back in jail , or were they released for good ? There has been no news from Philippine PEN since Mrs. Aquino 's presidency .
