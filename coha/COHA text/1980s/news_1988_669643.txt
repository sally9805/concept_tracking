Observers inside and outside the Gallaudet community tend to agree . And a number who were interviewed by the Monitor after a deaf faculty member was named president of the only university for the deaf in the United States tended to see the event as the latest in a series of advances for the deaf and other handicapped people in recent years. // The appointment Sunday of I. King Jordan , a deaf man who was dean of Gallaudet ' s college of arts and science , capped a hectic week during which Gallaudet students closed down the school . They were protesting the appointment of Elisabeth Zinser , a North Carolina college administrator who is not deaf and does not know sign language. // // Dr. Zinser had been chosen over Dean Jordan and another deaf candidate - Harvey J. Corson , superintendent of the Louisiana School for the Deaf . Jordan was named president after Zinser relinquished the appointment ; Jan Bassett Spilman , chairwoman of Gallaudet ' s board of trustees and a strong supporter of the Zinser appointment , resigned from the board. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can achieve , ' ' Jordan told a cheering crowd of about 250 students Sunday night . ' ' I am confident we will walk boldly into a future without artificial limits . It is a historic moment for deaf people around the world. ' ' // In its 124-year history Gallaudet had not had a deaf president. // Mr. Corson of the Louisiana school , in a telephone interview , called the Zinser appointment the ' ' last straw breaking the camel ' s back . ' ' The seven-day student strike was not just a reaction to a specific circumstance , he said , but a revolutionary eruption caused by ' ' years of inequities , injustice , and unfairness. ' ' // The students equate their struggle to the black civil rights movement . They say that , like American blacks , they suffer prejudice , paternalism , stereotyping , and a denial of equal opportunity in the hearing world. // There is an attitude of ' ' we know what ' s good for you , trust us , ' ' says Gallaudet doctoral student Jerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf and hearing people . ' ' I ' m sure you can find a qualified white person to head the NAACP , or a qualified Catholic to head B ' nai B ' rith , ' ' he says . ' ' Hearing people can say they understand , but they can ' t. ' ' // John Banzhaf III , a George Washington University law professor who heads his university ' s public-interest law project , has filed a discrimination suit against Gallaudet with the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights . He says that if Gallaudet is found to be in violation of the district ' s anti-discrimination law , it could be required to set up an affirmative action plan to place deaf people in more high administrative positions at Gallaudet. // Progress for the deaf has followed much the same timetable as progress for other handicapped people . Such improvements as closed-caption television for the deaf and ramps for people in wheelchairs have come only in the last 15 years , notes speech pathologist Nancy Tarulli . ' ' Society is changing , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people still are discriminated against all the time. ' ' // William E. Castle , director of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf , says : ' ' The past 20 years has been a boon for the deaf in the country . ' ' Mr. Castle cites legislation beginning in 1973 that bolstered public education for the handicapped and set uniform standards for deaf education in particular . ' ' The deaf have never had it so good , ' ' he says , ' ' but things could always be better. ' ' // As a group , Ms. Tarulli points out , deaf people are underemployed . Many must learn language from vibration , she explains , and their voices sound strange to hearing people . As a result deaf people suffer from a prejudicial attitude that makes speech and level of intelligence synonymous . ' ' People don ' t have the patience to enunciate and speak slowly ' ' she says. // But the deaf are making inroads . A 1987 study done by National Information Center on Deafness ( NICD ) shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers , and members of the clergy . There are deaf administrators , psychologists , social workers , counselors , and vocational rehabilitation specialists. // And there are 1 , 300 teachers of the deaf who are hearing-impaired themselves. // Deaf people drive cars , hold pilot ' s licenses , and pursue the same leisure activities as everyone else. // But David Wolfe of NICD says that educators have tried to get the deaf into the mainstream by requiring them to look , act , and function like hearing people . ' ' That ' s like trying to solve the race problem by making everybody white , ' ' he says . ' ' Some of these people have never heard a sound . How can they be expected to speak or act like hearing people ? ' ' // Mr. Wolfe says , ' ' With the right adjustments deaf people can do anything hearing people can do , given limitations . You won ' t see a lot of deaf musicians. ' ' // But progress hinges on a hearing-world willingness to make adjustments , says Jerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school psychologist . Adjustments in the work place for the deaf can be as simple as attaching a light to a machine to indicate when a process is finished , putting a deaf secretary in charge of filing and typing , bringing an interpreter in for meetings , or using visual cues and written reinforcements in conversations . Wolfe says a lot of intelligence is wasted because of resistance to adjustments. // Gallaudet English teacher James Tucker , who is deaf , says the student victory is a sweeping statement on behalf of all deaf people . He says his father , who is deaf , ' ' is a master wood craftsman , top man in his shop . He never became the foreman because he couldn ' t use the phone. ' ' // The student victory , Mr. Tucker says , ' ' made me think of my father . It made me think , yeah , a deaf person can be top dog. ' ' // //                    @
