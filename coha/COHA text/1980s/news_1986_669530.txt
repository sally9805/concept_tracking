This , I was to find , did not quite constitute the ' ' white-water experience. ' ' // In any case , it was with fearless abandon and a full-length rubber poncho that I flew off to ' ' shoot ' ' West Virginia ' s infamous New River , reputed to be the oldest river in the Western Hemisphere , inspiring Congress to designate 50 miles of it in 1978 as a national park , named New River Gorge National River. // The hour-and-a-half drive on Route 60 from Charleston to Thurmond , along the winding , lazy banks of the Kanawha River , is dotted with simple wood frame houses , clusters of mobile homes , and an occasional behemoth chemical plant . Young boys and older men - many of the latter retired or out-of-work coal miners - while away the hours fishing the Kanawha for channel catfish , walleye , and prized smallmouth bass. // // A stop in the hills at Chimney Corner Crafts , where coal jewelry , cedar novelties , and ' ' Indian things ' ' are sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local folks. // ' ' Yes , ' ' said the elderly woman behind the counter , as she folded a hand-stitched , tumbling-block-design quilt ; ' ' lots of folks stop on their way to the New River . No , ' ' she added , ' ' I ' ve never done it , and expect I never will . Just you hold on tight , ' ' she advised , and as I was half out the door , added with motherly concern , ' ' Now you stop in on your way back so ' s we know you made it. ' ' // Farther up the narrowing road , a small craft shop - nearly hidden behind a clothesline of bedspreads with electric-colored chenille peacocks , and rugs with the likeness of Elvis Presley - plead for attention. // None of the local people I talked to had ever been rafting , and all intended to keep it that way , thank you very much. // Pulling into the parking lot of Wildwater Expeditions Unlimited late in the dark , drizzling afternoon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragan , youngest of the three brothers who own the outfit. // ' ' Bring a sleeping bag ? ' ' he asked . ' ' Good , you can sleep there in the staff cabin . Plenty of room there until we get busy around Memorial Day. ' ' // ' ' What if it rains tomorrow ? ' ' I asked , hopping puddles from my car to the cabin . ' ' What if it does ? ' ' he shrugged . ' ' Gon na get wet anyway , aren ' t ya. ' ' // Next morning was bright , warm , and glorious , as five of us gathered for orientation on the riverbank . The water was smooth and glistening , rippled only by a cluster of jet-black whirligig water beetles. // ' ' Now everyone gets a life preserver , a little zip-lock bag to put bottle tops or other rubbish in , and a waterproof bag for your cameras and gear , ' ' said Eric Autenreith , one of the young , square-jawed guides. // ' ' Now don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikon lenses make a funny crunchy sound when stepped on . That noise may excite one of the passengers . And don ' t step on this big rubber bag , either . That ' s lunch. // ' ' And if you fall overboard , don ' t panic or try to stand up . The water moves fast , and the rocks are slippery . Just relax , put your head back , stare up at the clouds , and float down the river feet first . There ' s not a rapid on this river that someone hasn ' t floated through . We ' ll pick you up or throw you a rope when we ' re through shooting the rapid. ' ' // Right , Eric. // Chris reappeared for further instructions . ' ' Be sure and put on your personal flotation device before you get in the raft , and don ' t take it off until you ' re on shore . That ' s a state law . One more thing . There ' s going to be a lot of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , this is the wrong place for you to be. ' ' // Right , Chris. // After strapping on our ' ' personal flotation devices , ' ' five silly looking landlubbers stumbled like penguins onto the far back of the 18-foot , 225-pound , $3 , 000 , slippery-when-wet , black-nylon-and-neoprene , elongated inner tube referred to as a raft . Huckleberry Finn , eat your heart out. // ' ' John , how about you goin ' right up in front with Allen ? ' ' said Liz , as she tucked her long red hair up under her hat. // ' ' You mean me ? ' ' I whined. // Liz Watson and Allen Haden were co-captain guides today. // Off we paddled to the swirling middle of the river under Allen ' s pitifully off-key rendition of ' ' Nearer My God to Thee. ' ' // Very funny , Allen. // The first 10 minutes of the 15-mile trip were as restful as a ride on a Mississippi paddle boat . Enough time to learn a bit about each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which elicited groans of disapproval . We later resorted to downright threats and plots of mutiny as the jokes got longer and no better. // Despite all the superficial kidding around , Wildwater guides are competent , well trained , very serious about what ' s going on about them , and knowledgeable in the ways of the water and the history , geography , and geology of the area . No one I spoke to had less than five years ' experience with the company . The levity - or attempts at it - was just to get us to relax and loosen up. // Meanwhile , downstream the water began to quicken and ' ' dance ' ' a bit. // ' ' OK , now we ' re comin ' up to a good 3 rapid , ' ' said Liz , her usually calm voice tightening slightly . Rapids are rated 1 ( easiest ) to 6 ( most difficult ) in the East , a slightly different rating but no less difficult than those out West. // ' ' Now we want to paddle quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll follow . We don ' t want the river to carry us , we want to stay ahead of the flow to keep in control. // ' ' OK , everyone , sit well inside and brace yourself . OK , pick it up . Pick it up . Brace yourself , ' ' Liz shouted over the growing roar of the advancing whitecaps. // In one fraction of a second I remembered that dear little old lady whose inexperienced advice was to ' ' hold on tight . ' ' Well , with one hand on the top of the paddle , and one in the middle , we had all run out of hands ! // ' ' OK , lean in . Pick it up , pick it up . Just keep paddlin ' , ' ' Liz yelled , as the current pulled the nose of the raft head-first down into a swirl , jerking us around a mammoth sandstone boulder. // The front is where you get the wettest , I found , as a gigantic wave slapped me backward into the lap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up and wildly started paddling air , as the raft dipped to one side . Another belt from a wave swept over the front , dousing Allen and me and shoving the raft into the tender , still waters of a welcome eddy. // Not for long. // ' ' OK , keep it up , we ' re not through . Keep going , ' ' said Liz , her voice losing any restraint. // ' ' Geronimo ! ' ' someone screamed from the back , as we were driven up and then straight down into another spinning whirlpool , barely missing an outcropping of rocks , down through a chute of turbulent rapids , and finally into a quiet pool. // ' ' Good job . Nicely done . Everyone take five , ' ' Liz encouraged . ' ' Great . Really good , ' ' Allen beamed . A few coughs and sputters from up front , a quick head count , and more hooting and howling . We all made it through and couldn ' t wait for the next wild water. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , ' ' taunted Dick , one of the guys in back . ' ' Gee , it ' s downright dusty back here . ' ' A few well-aimed pitches with bailing buckets by Allen and me managed to stop Dick in mid-sentence and quiet him down for a few minutes. // A break for lunch by a quiet pool wasn ' t enough time to dry out , but long enough to wander through the sycamores and river birches to bird-watch , identify the local flora , and be dazzled by a show of hundreds of black swallowtail butterflies feeding in the sun at water ' s edge. // With a few sandwiches under our personal flotation devices , it was back on board the Titanic - as someone affectionately named our raft - for more rapids , repartee , and bad jokes. // ' ' OK , ' ' said Liz , as we settled back , full of food and confidence , ' ' we ' re comin ' up to one of the more technical rapids . See that big rock there ? That ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that city who tried to go over , rather than around , it . They sat there quite a while before they got unstuck . Now we don ' t want to rename it Boston Rock , do we , John ? ' ' // ' ' No , ' ' quickly speaking for all , I assured Liz , we didn ' t. // Despite someone ' s cry , ' ' Women and children first ! ' ' as we were hurled straight toward Chicago Rock , we missed it , and I ' m pleased to report that it still carries the name of the Windy City. // That ' s more or less how it went that wild and wonderful day on the New River - waves and currents tossed us about like a beach ball , separated by quiet , forgiving pools to swim in . And plenty of time to just sit back and watch bass jump for mayflies while turkey buzzards soared high above the canyon walls and inquisitive minks scampered along the banks. // For the beavers we spotted , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper ' ' New River is much easier going than the ' ' lower . ' ' And if you just want to go along for the ride or would rather bail than paddle , you may sit in the middle and hang on to the straps in the rough spots. // One bit of prudent advice : Rafting tends to bring out the Hatfields and McCoys in rival raft companies . If you come across another group of ' ' river rats , ' ' jockey for a downwind position . That way the wind is to your advantage if perchance someone is very naughty , and should childishly start a water fight . Just remember - keep your raft in the water , the water out of your raft , and don ' t get wet , get even. // If you ' re the lone raft on the river , make sure that no one on board hits terra firma any dryer than you . A dear , sweet woman in our group made the unfortunate mistake of pleading , ' ' Please , my hair can ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered off the raft looking as if she ' d just gone over Niagara Falls without the barrel. // Practical information // Choosing a company . West Virginia has more white-water rafting than anywhere else in the East , with some 35 rafting companies throughout the state . Choose one that is experienced and not a fly-by-nighter. // Weather . Don ' t worry . As Eric Autenreith told us , ' ' Everyone puts out a little more effort in bad weather . Besides , people have fun in the rain ; look at Gene Kelly ! ' ' // What to wear . In summer , a T-shirt , sunglasses with eyeglass straps , swimsuit or shorts , suntan lotion , and light long-sleeved windbreaker. // In spring and autumn , a wool hat and sweater , heavy windbreaker . Wet suits may be rented if you need one , and be sure to take a full change of clothing . Soft-soled shoes are required on all trips. // When to go . Most companies operate from April to October . Avoid holidays , especially Memorial Day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week is least crowded , as are spring and autumn trips. // Where to stay . West Virginia is loaded with national parks , and the list of bed-and-breakfast inns is growing . Some rafting companies have shelters where you can pitch a tent or throw down a sleeping bag for as little as $5 a night . In Thurmond , there is one modest hotel , the Bankers Club , run by Erskine and Jackie Pugh . Rates are $22. 50 ( $24. 50 with bath ) per room . No credit cards , please . For reservations call ( 304 ) 469-9161. // Further questions . Call the West Virginia Department of Tourism at 1-800-CALL WVA. // //
