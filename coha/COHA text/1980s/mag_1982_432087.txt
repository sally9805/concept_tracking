 | There are lovers of art who will go to see t almost anything ? Eskimo jewelry , Alsatian combs . Siberian rugs ? except pots . - They dislike cooing over clay ; a crumbling jug , even one that is 2,000 years old , leaves their imaginations limp . This disdain is not likely to soften , since the present culture does not encourage a serious regard for pottery . Most utensils are made by machine , and the traditional artisan class , which once made beautiful objects by hand , has all but vanished . The democratic appetite prefers the rough and popular to the aristocratic and refined . Nonetheless , the pot prejudice is foolish . A great Japanese teacup can exhibit the touch of hand , fineness of coloring and delicacy of decision characteristic of great painting or sculpture ; and there is something wonderful about objects that arrange so fine a meeting between art and appetite . Since that is not the American way , however , it is remarkable that a vigorous art of ceramics has developed here in the last 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with pots . At the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York curators Suzanne Foley and Richard Marshall have put together a show called " Ceramic Sculpture : Six Artists . " * The artists included ? Peter Voulkos , John Mason , Kenneth Price , Robert Arneson , David Gilhooly and Richard Shaw ? mostly work in the West , where the arts and crafts movement is strongest ; it is on the West Coast , in particular , that the Oriental reverence for ceramic objects holds some sway . These ceramicists , despite their devotion to craft , consider themselves artists first and foremost . Far from being effete or overdelicate , their work-reflects a taste that is either bold and passionate or playful and campy . According to most accounts , Peter Voulkos is the founding father of contemporary ceramics . It was Voulkos who , working with John Mason in the late 1950s , began to present ceramics as sculpture . He increased the size of his work , although he continued to throw pieces on a wheel , and he brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract expressionists ? into the medium of clay . The suppleness of clay was well suited to the punchy style , the passionate spontaneity , of abstract expressionism . In clay an artist could reveal , better than in most mediums , the fine line between compositional order and chance incident . Earthy Power : Sculpture by Voulkos has a distinctive presence . In " Untitled " ( 1981 ) , for example , a bell or bottlelike form , which has a squat , earthy power , is cut by a savage gash . The lines drawn into the clay both articulate the general form of the piece and seem to crack it open . The power to contain is about equal to the power to burst : some of the lines look like ropes beginning to snap under a slowly expanding pressure . Subsequent styles in American art ? color field , minimal , pop and conceptual ? have also been explored in clay . The most vigorous impulse , however , has been the odd , very funky style of California , which developed in the late 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of minimalism . William Wiley is the bestknown painter in this style , and his friend Robert Arneson does related work in ceramics . A good example of Arneson 's lampooning is " Pablo Ruiz with Itch , " which parodies the obsessive interest in every facet of Picasso 's life . Here the master 's itch has been put on the pedestal , and his big black eye , the subject of so much fawning comment , appears more silly than sublime . Frogs : As a work of art , Arneson 's " Pablo " possesses fresh wit and formal interest . Without these , the California style , already too nutty for many tastes , becomes hard to bear . For example , David Gilhooly 's work , which portrays goofy-looking frogs , is too cute , and his allegorical impulse is corny and heavy-handed : one frog is drowning in consumer goods , including a junk food called " Frogyos . " Richard Shaw brings a surreal quality into much of his work in clay . He juxtaposes objects not usually brought together ? a couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he worked in a trompe l'oeil style similar to that of the turn-of-the-century painters Peto and Harnett . In his early work , Kenneth Price also arranged strange juxtapositions : for example , he portrayed a cup on the back of a snail . Price may well be the most important ceramicist of his generation , for he has drawn strength from most of the different styles of art that have emerged in @#  | the last twenty years , while remaining always , inimitably , himself . To all his varied output he brings wit and visual flair . His colors seem to have been dipped in the light of the Southwest , and he often gets an undertone of danger into even his most playful work : the sunny menace in " Death Shrine 3 , " for example , or the lewd , glistening forms ? like tongues ? that seem to poke from gaily colored balls . Price 's art of the 1970s ? " Town Unit 1 " is an example ? may be his most remarkable . In a culture overridden by junk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low art . Few have done so as successfully as Price , whose art is without easy condescension or slap-happy vulgarity . His tableaux of sun-licked plates draw their energy from the ticky-tacky-taco style of curio shops in the American Southwest , but their remarkable presence comes from Price 's fine eye for the quirky ( as opposed to the cute ) , his rigorous technique and his power of composition . Brushy Verve : This exhibit will not often please those who really want to look at pots ; pieces from artists who work in a more traditional manner , such as Toshiko Takaezu , have not been included . At the Blum Helman Gallery in New York , however , there is a wonderful show of Andrew Lord 's sculptures of teapots , cups , dishes and mugs . They are presented with some of the detached flavor of a department-store display , in finely composed groups . The painting on the objects is full of brushy verve . ( Some of the objects take respectful revenge on cubist still life : just as cubist painting flattened bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three dimensions . ) The delightful colors and shapes evoke the play of light and shadow . These cups are not for drinking tea ? but then , satisfying the eye is worth any amount of tea . @#
