" He fell ! He fell ! " <P> For 15 years General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte , 72 , has held Chile in his proud and dictatorial grasp  --  once even boasting that " there is not a single leaf in this country that I do not move . " So why should n't he have believed that Chileans would vote si last week in an extraordinary plebiscite on whether to extend his presidential term to 1997 ? But shortly before 2 a.m. on Thursday , an ashen-faced official stepped from La Moneda , the presidential palace in Santiago , and headed for a nearby government building . There he told TV viewers that the public had said no to the extension . The final tally , with 7.2 million votes cast : 54.7% to 43% . Despite the hour , several hundred jubilant demonstrators sounded car horns in the capital and howled delightedly , " He fell ! He fell ! " <P> The vote was a turning point on Chile 's long road back to a nearly 150-year tradition of democracy , which was toppled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ousting the elected , but floundering , government of Marxist President Salvador Allende Gossens , Pinochet has led a military junta that routinely uses terror to enforce its will . Deep scars remain from a 1973-76 antileftist purge in which tens of thousands of Chileans were exiled , tortured or executed . Meanwhile , the politically explosive gulf between rich and poor has steadily grown wider . " We broke an authoritarian system , " said Ricardo Lagos , president of the Party for Democracy , one of the 16 groups that made up the Command for the No , which led the campaign to defeat Pinochet . " Now our work is to reconstruct a democratic system . " <P> The vote will not transform Chile overnight . If presidential elections are held as scheduled in December 1989 , Pinochet , who has already headed the country longer than any other leader , would retain power at least until March 1990 . He can also remain commander of the army until 1995 . Whenever the voting does take place ( opposition leaders have pressed for an earlier date ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field that allows the winner to emerge with enough support to govern . <P> For his part , Pinochet vowed not to go quietly . Wearing a crisp dress-white uniform , the general accepted " the verdict of the majority " but pledged " to complete my mandate with a patriotic sense . " He buttressed the point by refusing to accept the resignation of his 16-member Cabinet , which then agreed to stay . <P> Pinochet 's defiance produced a bizarre pattern of dancing and rioting in the streets . Police fired tear gas and water cannons at some antigovernment protesters in two days of clashes that left dozens wounded and two people dead . More than 20 foreign journalists were among the injured . On Friday hundreds of thousands of Chileans celebrated the no vote with a joyous rally in Santiago . Singing and swaying to music by popular groups , they called on Pinochet to step down .
