On a chilly South Texas afternoon , 20 federal and state lawmen sporting flak jackets and semiautomatic rifles descended on a secluded bungalow near the Rio Grande in Starr County . They arrested three men who were darting out the back . Inside , the cops found giant trash bags of marijuana . Suddenly the ceiling gave way from the weight of other people hiding in the bungalow . All told , 14 Mexicans were charged with drug possession , and 2,000 lbs . of dope were confiscated . <P> The raid last February was one of a mounting number of armed encounters along the Texas border between lawmen and well-organized , well-financed narcotics rings . As authorities have cracked down on smuggling in Florida , the Rio Grande valley has emerged as the hot corridor for drug runners . One-third of all the cocaine , marijuana and heroin now entering the U.S. from Mexico is believed to come across the valley . <P> Nowhere is the traffic heavier than in Starr County , a remote , Rhode Island- size expanse of gentle hills that flanks the Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tiny riverfront hamlets , smugglers oversee the packaging and shipment of drugs by truck and plane into the U.S. interior . <P> By one federal estimate , 40% of all the drugs crossing South Texas move through Starr , sometimes amounting to 15 tons of marijuana and 1,000 lbs . of coke a week . Confiscations in the Rio Grande valley doubled last year ; arrests this year by the Drug Enforcement Administration shot up from 230 to 570 . <P> Starr County 's 92 miles of riverbank affords myriad landing points for rubber rafts and the human " mules " who wade across with backpacks . Among some of the Hispanics who make up 96% of Starr 's population , smuggling has been a tradition since the Civil War , when Confederate cotton was moved south . <P> In an area of close-knit families , strangers stand out , making police undercover work nearly impossible . Good informants are tough to recruit because , as DEA Agent Kenneth Miley explains , " families do n't tell on families , " although that has changed some now that the feds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established smuggling networks ensure a continuity to operations . After the feds busted one cocaine runner last year , his brother took over . When he was arrested , another brother came to the fore . <P> The drug trade is controlled by perhaps a dozen Mexican " mafiosos , " some of whom live south of the border . The mafiosos are assuming new muscle as Mexico 's economy declines and illegal aliens pour into Texas . Drug gangs have enlisted wetbacks as couriers , paying them $150 or more to float sacks of pot across the Rio Grande . Many illegals stay on to become full-time drug runners .
