There were five bedrooms , three bathrooms , two living rooms  --  this one they used generally or with company , the other , much smaller at the far end of the apartment was , as customary , for her to go to when he had business to discuss , or when her sister or girlfriends or relations were visiting so their chatter would not disturb him . Around Sharazad was always movement , always family nearby , children , nannies  --  except after sunset , though frequently relations or close friends were staying in the guest bedrooms . He never minded , for they were a happy , gregarious family , in front of him . It was also part of his bargain with her father that he would patiently learn Iranian ways , patiently live Iranian ways for three years and a day .

Oh , she went along with my decision , and she 's never mentioned it but I do n't think she ever approved it . He could hear the muted sounds of her voice and the maid 's voice from the kitchen and the quiet it enhanced was , as always , wonderful  --  such a contrast to the cockpit that was his other life . His cushions were very comfortableand he watched the fire . There was some gunfire in the night but by now it was so commonplace that they hardly heard it .

Maybe she 's safer here than anywhere , but not if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , but then they all are at the moment . I wish to God I knew if the army 's really been ordered to crush the revolt .

And God . Where 's the One God now ? In all the hearts and heads of Believers . Shi'ites are Believers . So 's Sharazad . And all her family . And you ? No , not yet but I 'm working on it . I promised him I 'd work on it , promised I 'd read the Koran and keep an open mind . And ? Now 's not the time to think of that . Be practical , think practically . She 's in danger .

My God , I owe him so much , so very much . A slight noise distracted him . Sharazad was standing in the doorway wearingthe chador and a light veil that he had never seen before . Her eyes were never more alluring . The chador was sibilant as she moved closer . Then she let it fall open . She wore nothing underneath . The sight of her made him gasp . " So . " Her voice as always soft and throbbing , the Farsi sweet-sounding . " So , Excellency , my husband , so now my chador pleases you ?

The thought would drive me mad . " He began to pick her up but she whispered , " No , Beloved , let us stay here , " and he replied , " But the servants . . . " and again she whispered , " Forget them , they 'll not disturb us , forget them , forget everything , I beg you , Beloved , and only remember that this is your house , this is your hearth , and I am your eternal slave .

Later , during dinner , the front doorbell disturbed their peace . Her servant Hassan answered it , then came back into the room , closing the door . " Master , it 's Excellency General Valik , " he said softly . " He apologizes that he arrives so late but it 's important and asks if Your Excellency would grant him a few minutes . " Lochart 's irritation soared but Sharazad reached over and touched him gently and it went away . " See him , Beloved . I will wait for you in bed . Hassan , bring a fresh plate and heat up the horisht , His Excellency 's bound to be hungry . " Valik apologized profusely for arriving so late , refused food twice but of course allowed himself to be persuaded and ate ravenously . Lochart waited patiently , fulfilling his promise to her father to remember Iranian ways  --  that family came first , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be blunt , never to be direct . In Farsi it was much easier than in English . As soon as he could , he switched to English . " I 'm very pleased to see you , General . What can I do for you ? " " I only heard half an hour ago that you were back in Tehran . This horisht is easily the best I 've had in years . I 'm so sorry to disturb you so late . " " No trouble . " Lochart left the silence to prosper . The older man ate without embarrassment that he ate alone . A piece of lamb attached itself to his mustache and Lochart watched it , fascinated , wondering how long it would remain there , then Valik wiped his mouth . " My compliments top203Sharazad  --  her cook is well trained . I will tell my favorite cousin , Excellency Jared . " " Thank you . " Lochart waited . Again the silence hung between them . Valik sipped some tea . " Did the clearance for the 212 come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lochart was unprepared for the question . " I know Mac sent a messenger to wait for it . I 'd phone him but unfortunately our phone 's out . Why ? " " The partners would like you to fly the charter . " " Captain McIver 's assigned Captain Lane , presuming there 's a clearance . " " It will be granted . " Valik wiped his mouth again and helped himself to more tea . " The partners would like you to fly the charter . I 'm sure McIver will agree . " " Sorry , but I 've got to get back to Zagros , I want to make sure everything 's okay . " He told him briefly what had happened there . " I 'm sure Zagros can wait a few days . I 'm sure Jared would be pleased you thought it important to do what the partners ask . " Lochart frowned . " I 'm happy to do anything . What 's so important to the partners about this charter , a few spares , a few rials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very concerned to give the best service . So that 's all right , then ? " " I 'd . . first I 'd have to take it up with Mac , second I doubt if the 212 ' 11 be cleared , third I really should get back to my base . " Valik smiled his nicest smile . " I 'm sure Mac will give his approval . You 'll have clearance to leave Tehran airspace . " He got up . " I 'm going to see Mac now and I 'll tell him you 're agreeable . Thank Sharazad  --  again a thousand apologies for calling so late but these are troubled times . " Lochart did not move from the table . " I still want to know what 's so important about a few spares and a hundred thousand rials . " " The partners have decided it is , and so my dear young friend , hearing you were here and knowing your close relationship with my family , I presumed at once that you would be happy to do this if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are n't we ? " It was said flat now , though the smile remained . Lochart 's eyes narrowed . " I 'm glad to do anything to help b  --  " " Good , then it 's settled . Thank you . I 'll see myself out . " From the doorwayValik turned and pointedly looked around at the apartment . " You are a very lucky man , Captain . I envy you . " When Valik had gone , Lochart sat by the dying fire , staring at the flames . Hassan and a maid cleaned away the dishes , said good night but he did notp204hear them  --  nor Sharazad who came back later , peered at him , then went quietly back to bed , dutifully leaving him to his reverie . Lochart was sick at heart . He knew that Valik was aware that everything of value in the apartment , along with the apartment itself , had been a wedding gift from Sharazad 's father . Jared Bakravan had even given him de facto ownership of the whole building  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As much as I appreciate your generosity I ca n't accept all this , sir , " Lochart had said . " It 's impossible . " " But these are material things , unimportant things . " " Yes , but this is too much . I know my pay 's not great , but we can manage . Truly . " " Yes , of course . But why should n't my daughter 's husband live pleasantly ? How else can you be at peace to learn Iranian ways and fulfill your promise ? I assure you , my son , these represent little value to me . Now you are part of my family . Family is most important in Iran . Family looks after family . " " Yes , but I must look after her  --  I must , not you . " " Of course , and with the Help of God you will , in time , provide for her in the way she is used to . But now this is not possible for you with the support for your ex-wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to arrange matters in a civilized way , our Iranian way . You have promised to live as we live , no ? " " Yes . But please , I can not accept all this . Give her what you like , not me . I must be allowed to do the best I can . " " I 'm sure you will . Meanwhile , this is all my gift to you , not to her . This makes my gift of her to you possible . " " Give it to her not t  --  " Jared Bakravan had said sharply , " It is the Will of God that man is the master of the house . If it is not your house then you will not be the master . I must insist . I am head of the family and Sharazad will do what I say and for Sharazad I must insist , or the wedding can not take place . I realize your Western dilemma though I do n't understand it , my son . But here Iranian ways dominate all else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast loneliness of the sitting room Lochart nodded to himself . That 's right and I chose Sharazad , chose to accept but . . . but that sonofabitchValik threw it all in my face and made me feel dirty again and I hate him for it , hate not paying for everything , and know the only gift I can give her is freedom she would never otherwise have and my life if need be . At least she 's Canadian now and does n't have to stay . Do n't fool yourself , she 's Iranian and always will be . Would she be at home in Vancouver , B.C. , with all that rain , no family , no friends , and nothingp205Iranian ? Yes , yes , I think so ; for a time I 'd make up for all the other . For a while , of course not forever . It was the first time he had confronted the real problem looming between them . Our Iran 's gone forever , the old one , the Shah one . Never mind that perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will I. I speak Farsi and she 's my wife and Jared 's powerful . If we have to leave temporarily , I 'll make up for the temporary parting , no problem there . The future 's still rosy and good and I love her so very much and bless God for her . . . The fire was almost finished now and he smelled the comforting , burned wood fragrance and , with it , a thread of her perfume . The cushions still held the indentations where they had lain and though he was totally satisfied and spent , he ached for her . She 's really one of the houris , the spirits of Paradise , he thought sleepily . I 'm in her spell and that 's wonderful , I 've no complaints and if I died tonight I know what Paradise is like . She 's wonderful , Jared 's wonderful , in due course her children will be wonderful and her family . . . Ah , family ! Family looks after family , that 's the law , I have to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her father made that clear . The last of the embers spluttered and , in dying , momentarily blazed up . " What 's so important about a few spares and a few rials ? " he asked the flames . The flames did not answer him.  |p209AT  TABRIZ ONE : 7:12 A.M. Charlie Pettikin was fitfully asleep , curled up on a mattress on the floor under a single blanket , his hands tied in front of him . It was just dawn and very cold . The guards had not allowed him a portable gas fire and he was locked into the section of Erikki Yokkonen 's cabin that would normally be a storeroom . Ice glistened on the inside of the panes of glass in the small window . The window was barred on the outside . Snow covered the sill . His eyes opened and he jerked upright , startled , not knowing where he was for the moment . Then his memory flooded back and he hunched against the wall , his whole body aching . " What a damned mess ! " he muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he awkwardly wiped the sleep out of his eyes , and rubbed his face , feeling filthy . The stubble of his beard was flecked with gray . Hate being unshaved , he thought . G9IRAQSAUDIARABIAAI : SHAH AZ U/f of Omanp210Today 's Monday . I got here Saturday at sunset and they caught me yesterdaymorning . Bastards ! On Saturday evening there had been many noises around the cabin that had added to his disquiet . Once he was sure he heard muffled voices . Quietly he doused the lights , slid the bolt back , and stood on the stoop , the Very pistol in his hand . With great care he had searched the darkness . Then he saw , or thought he saw , a movement thirty yards away , then another farther off . " Who are you ? " he called out , his voice echoing strangely . " What do you want ? " No one answered him . Another movement . Where ? Thirty forty yards away  --  difficult to judge distances at night . Look , there 's another ! Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a branch . Or perhaps  --  what was that ? Over there by the big pine . " You ! Over there ! What do you want ? " No answer . He could not make out if it was a man or not . Enraged and even a little frightened he aimed and pulled the trigger . The banggg seemed like a clap of thunder and echoed off the mountains and the red flare ripped toward the tree , ricocheted off it in a shower of sparks , sprayed into another to bury itself spluttering and spitting in a snowdrift . He waited . Nothing happened . Noises in the forest , the roof of the hangar creaking , wind in the treetops , sometimes snow falling from an overladen tree branch that sprang back , free once more . Making a big show he angrily stamped his feet against the cold , switched on the light , loaded the pistol again , and rebolted the door . " You 're getting to be an old woman in your old age , " he said aloud , then added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alone , hate snow , hate the cold , hate being scared and this morning at Galeg Morghi shook me , God curse it and that 's a fact  --  but for young Ross I know that SAVAK bastard would 've killed me ! " He checked that the door was barred and all the windows , closed the curtains against the night , then poured a large vodka and mixed it with some frozen orange juice that was in the freezer and sat in front of the fire and collected himself . There were eggs for breakfast and he was armed . The gas fire worked well . It was cozy . After a while he felt better , safer . Before he went to bed in the spare bedroom , he rechecked the locks . When he was satisfied he took off his flying boots and lay on the bed . Soon he was asleep . In the morning the night fear had disappeared . After a breakfast of fried eggs on fried bread , just as he liked it , he tidied the room , put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submachine gun was shoved in his face , six of the revolutionaries crowded into the room and the questioning began . Hours of it.  | " I 'm not a spy , not American . I keep telling you I 'm British , " over and over . " Liar , your papers say you 're South African . By Allah , are they false too ? " The leader  --  the man who called himself Fedor Rakoczy  --  was tough-looking , taller , and older than the others , with hard brown eyes , his English accented . The same questions over and over : " Where do you come from , why are you here , who is your CIA superior , who is your contact here , where is Erikki Yokkonen ? " " I do n't know . I 've told you fifty times I do n't know  --  there was no one here when I landed at sunset last night . I was sent to pick him up , him and his wife . They had business in Tehran . " " Liar ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should they run away if you were coming to pick them up ? " " I 've told you . I was not expected . Why should they run away ?

We 're a British company and I demand to see our consul in Tabriz . I dem  --  " " Enemies of the People can not demand anything ! Even mercy . It is the Will of God that we are at war . In war people get shot ! " The questioning had gone on all morning . In spite of his protests they had taken all his papers , his passport with the vital exit and residence permits , and had bound him and thrown him in here with dire threats if he attempted to run away . Later , Rakoczy and two guards had returned . " Why did n't you tell me you brought the spares for the 212 ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said angrily . " Who the hell are you ? Give me back my papers . I demand to see the British consul . Undo my hands , goddamnit ! " " God will strike you if you blaspheme ! Down on your knees and beg God 's forgiveness . " They forced him to kneel . " Beg forgiveness ! " He obeyed , hating them . " You fly a 212 as well as a 206 ? " " No , " he said , awkwardly getting to his feet . " Liar ! It 's on your license . " Rakoczy had thrown it on the table . " Why do you lie ? " " What 's the difference ? You believe nothing I say . You wo n't believe the truth . Of course I know it 's on my license . Did n't I see you take it ? Of course I fly a 212 if I 'm rated . "  | " The komiteh will judge you and sentence you , " Rakoczy had said with a finality that sent a shock wave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset they had brought him some rice and soup and gone away again . He had slept hardly at all and now , in the dawn , he knew how helpless he was . His fear began to rise up . Once in Vietnam he had been shot down and caught and sentenced to death by the Viet Cong but his squadron had come back for him with gunships and Green Berets and they had shot up the village and the Viet Cong with it . That was another time that he had escapeda certainty . " Never bet on death until you 're dead . Thataway , old buddy , " his young American commander had said , " thataway you sleep nights . " The commander had been Conroe Starke . Their helicopter squadron had been mixed , American and British and some Canadian , based at Da Nang . What another bloody mess that was ! Wonder how Duke 's doing now ? he thought . Lucky bastard . Lucky to be safe at Kowiss and lucky to have Manuela . Now there 's one smasher and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes of hers , and just the right amount of curves . He let his mind wander , wondering about her and Starke , about where were Erikki and Azadeh , about that Vietnam village  --  and about the young Captain Ross and his men . But for him ! Ross was another savior . In this life you have to have saviors to survive , those curious people who miraculously come into your life for no apparent reason just in time to give you the chance you desperately need , or to extract you from disaster or danger or evil . Do they appear because you prayed for help ? At the very edge you always pray , somehow , even if it 's not to God . But God has many names . He remembered old Soames at the embassy with his , " Do n't forget , Charlie , Mohammed the Prophet proclaimed that Allah  --  God  --  has three thousandnames . A thousand are known only to the angels , a thousand only to the prophets , three hundred are in the Torah , the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Psalms of David , another three hundred in the New Testament , and ninety-nine in the Koran . That makes two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine . One name has been hidden by God . In Arabic it 's called : Ism Allah ala'zam : the Greatest Name of God . Everyone who reads the Koran will have read it without knowing it . God is wise to hide His Greatest Name , eh ? " Yes , if there is a God , Pettikin thought , cold and aching . Just before noon Rakoczy returned with his two men . Astonishingly , Rakoczy politely helped him to his feet and began undoing his bonds . " Good morning , Captain Pettikin . So sorry for the mistake . Please follow me . " Hep213led the way into the main room . Coffee was on the table . " Do you drink coffee black or English style with milk and sugar ? " Pettikin was rubbing his chafed wrists , trying to get his mind working . " What 's this ? The prisoner was offered a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nothing . " Pettikin stared at him , still not sure . " With milk and sugar . " The coffee tasted wonderful and revived him . He helped himself to more . " So it 's a mistake , all a mistake ? " " Yes . I , er , checked your story and it was correct , God be praised . You will leave immediately . To return to Tehran . " Pettikin 's throat felt tight at his sudden reprieve  --  apparent reprieve , he thought suspiciously . " I need fuel . All our fuel 's been stolen , there 's no fuel in our dump . " " Your aircraft has been refueled . I supervised it myself . " " You know about choppers ? " Pettikin was wondering why the man appearedso nervous . " A little . " " Sony , but I , er , I do n't know your name . " " Smith . Mr. Smith . " Fedor Rakoczy smiled . " You will leave now , please . At once . " Pettikin found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men watched him silently . He noted they were carrying Soviet machine pistols . On the table by the door was his overnight bag . Beside it were his documents . Passport , visa , work permit , and Iranian CAA  --  issued flying license . Trying to keep the astonishment off his face , he made sure they were all there and stuck them in his pocket . When he went for the refrigerator , one of the men stood in his way and motioned him away . " I 'm hungry , " Pettikin said , still very suspicious . " There 's something to eat in your plane . Follow me , please . " Outside , the air smelled very good to him , the day crisp and fine with a clean , very blue sky . To the west more snow clouds were building . Eastward , the way over the pass was clear . All around him the forest sparkled , the light refracted by the snow . In front of the hangar was the 206 , windshield cleaned , all windows cleaned . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a side pocket , not beside his seat where he normally left it . Very carefully he began a preflight check . " Please to hurry , " Rakoczy said . " Of course . " Pettikin made a great show of hurrying but he did n't , missing nothing in his inspection , all his senses tuned to find a subtle sabotage , or even a crude one . Gas checked out , oil , everything . He could see and feelp214their growing nervousness . There was still no one else on the base . In the hangar he could see the 212 with its engine parts still neatly spread out . The spares that he had brought had been put on a bench nearby . " Now you are ready . " Rakoczy said it as an order . " Get in , you will refuel at Bandar-e Pahlavi as before . " He turned to the others , embraced both of them hastily , and got into the right seat . " Start up and leave at once . I am coming to Tehran with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckled himself in , locked the door neatly , then lifted the headset from its hook behind him and put it on , clearly accustomed to the inside of a cockpit . Pettikin noticed that the other two had taken up defensive positions facing the road . He pressed the Engine Start . Soon the whine and the familiarity  --  and the fact that " Smith " was aboard and therefore sabotage unlikely  --  made him light-headed . " Here we go , " he said into the boom mike and took off in a scudding rush , banked sweetly , and climbed for the pass . " Good , " Rakoczy said , " very good . You fly very well . " Casually he put the gun across his knees , muzzle pointing at Pettikin . " Please do n't fly too well . " " Put the safety catch on  --  or I wo n't fly at all . " Rakoczy hesitated . He clicked it in place . " I agree it is dangerous while flying . " At six hundred feet Pettikin leveled off , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . " What 're you doing ? " " Just want to get my bearings . " He was relying on the fact that though " Smith " clearly knew his way around a cockpit , he could n't fly a 206 or he would have taken her . His eyes were searching below for a clue to the man 's nervousness and his haste to leave . The field seemed the same . Near the junction of the narrow base road with the main road that went northwest to Tabriz were two trucks . Both headed for the base . From this height he could easily see they were army trucks . " I 'm going to land to see what they want , " he said . " If you do , " Rakoczy said without fear , " it will cost you much pain and permanent mutilation . Please go to Tehran  --  but first to Bandar-e Pahlavi . " " What 's your real name ? " " Smith . " Pettikin left it at that , circled once , then followed the Tehran road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  confident now that somewhereen route his time would come.  |p215AT  TEHRAN : 8:30 A.M. Tom Lochart eased his old Citroen through the debris of the night 's battles , heading for Galeg Morghi . The morning was sour and freezing and he was already late though he had started out just after dawn . He had passed many bodies and wailing mourners , many burned-out wrecks of cars and trucks , some still smoldering  --  flotsam from the night 's riots . Knots of armed or semiarmed civilians still manned balconies or barricadesand he had had to make a dozen diversions . Many men wore the Khomeini green armband now . All Green Bands were armed . The streets were ominously empty of traffic . From time to time police trucks screamed past , a few cars and trucks , but they paid no attention to him except to sound their horns , cursing him out of the way . He cursed them back , almost not caring if he ever reached the airport that would be a perfect solution to hisAL SHARGAZu/f of manp216dilemma . Only the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced him onward . How could such a wonderful woman as Annoush , who had been so kind to him since he came into the family , have married such a bastard ? And how could the two wonderful kids who adored Sharazad and called him ExcellencyUncle . . . He swerved to avoid a car that charged out of a side street on the wrong side of the road . The car did not stop and he cursed it , and Tehran and Iran and Valik and said , " Insha'Allah , " out loud but it did not help him . Overhead was a dirty , snow-filled overcast that he did not like at all , and he had hated to leave the warmth of his bed and Sharazad . Just before dawn the alarm had startled them awake . " I thought you were n't going , my darling . I thought you said you were leaving tomorrow . " " I 've got a sudden charter , at least I think I have . That 's what Valik came about . I 've got to see Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few days . Go back to sleep , my darling . " He had shaved , dressed hurriedly , had a quick cup of coffee , and left . Outside it was still dark with just a sullen wisp of dawn , the air acrid and smoke heavy . In the distance was the inevitable , sporadic gunfire . Suddenly he was filled with foreboding . McIver lived only a few blocks away . Lochart was surprised to find him fully dressed . " Hello , Tom . Come on in . The clearance came through at midnight , delivered by hand . Valik 's got power  --  I never believed we 'd get it . Coffee ? " " Thanks . Did he see you last night ? " " Yes . " McIver led the way into the kitchen . Coffee was perking nicely . No sign of Genny , Paula , or Nogger Lane . He poured for Lochart . " Valik told me he 'd seen you and that you 'd agreed to go . " Lochart grunted . " I said I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if we got the clearance . Where 's Nogger ? " " Back in his flat . I canceled him last night . He 's still pretty shook from being involved in that riot . " " I can imagine . What happened to the girl ? Paula ? " " She 's in the spare room , her Alitalia flight 's still grounded , but she 'll probably be off today . George Talbot of the embassy dropped by last night and said he heard the airport 's been cleared of revolutionaries and today , with any luck , there 'll be a few flights in and out . " Lochart nodded thoughtfully . " Then maybe Bakhtiar will win after all . " " Let 's hope , eh ? The BBC this morning said Doshan Tappeh 's still in Khomeini hands and the Immortals are just ringing it , sitting on their tails . "  |p217Lochart  shuddered at the thought of Sharazad there . She had promised not to go again . " Did Talbot say anything about a coup ? " " Only that the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Iranian , and a general , I would n't hesitate . Talbot agreed , said the coup 'll happen in the next three days , it 'll have to , the revs are getting too many guns . " Lochart could almost see Sharazad chanting with the thousands , young Captain Karim Peshadi declaring for Khomeini and three Immortals deserting . " Do n't know what I 'd do , Mac , if I was one of them . " " Thank God we 're not and this 's Iran , not England with us at the barricades . Anyway , Tom , if the 125 comes in today I 'll put Sharazad on her . She 'll be better off in Al Shargaz , at least for a couple of weeks . Did she get her Canadian passport ? " " Yes , but Mac , I do n't think she 'll go . " Lochart told him about her joining the insurrection at Doshan Tappeh . " My God , she needs her head examined . I 'll get Gen to see her . " " Is Genny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . If it was up to me she'd 've been there a week already . I 'll do what I can . Sharazad 's all right ? " " Wonderful , but I wish to God Tehran 'd settle down . I get worried sick about her here and me in Zagros . " Lochart gulped some coffee . " If I 'm going I 'd better get with it . Keep an eye on her , will you ? " He looked at McIver , hard and straight . " What 's this charter about , Mac ? " Stonily McIver looked back at him . " Tell me exactly what Valik said to you last night . " Lochart told him . Exactly . " He 's a right bastard to try to make you lose face like that . " " He succeeded very well . Unfortunately he 's still family and in Iran  --  well , you know . " Lochart kept the bitterness out of his voice . " I asked him what 's so important about a few spares and a few rials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McIver 's face was set and seemed older and heavier than he had ever known , yet tougher . " Mac , what is so important about a few spares and a few rials ? " McIver finished his coffee and poured some more . He dropped his voice . " Do n't want to wake Genny or Paula , Tom . This 's between us . " He told Lochart what had happened in the office . Exactly . Lochart felt the sudden rush of blood to his face . " SAVAK ? Him and Annoush and little Setarem and Jalal ? Jesus wept ! " " That 's why I agreed to try . Have to . I 'm equally trapped . We 're both trapped . But there 's more . " McIver told him about the money . Lochart gasped . " 12 million rials , cash ? Or the equivalent in Switzerland ? "  | " Keep your voice down . Yes , 12 for me , and another 12 for the pilot . Last night he said his offer still stands and not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen had n't been here , I 'd 've thrown him out . " Lochart was hardly listening . 12 million rials or cash elsewhere ? Mac 's right . If Valik offered that here in Tehran what would he really pay when he 's in sight of the border ? " Christ ! " McIver watched him . " What do you think , Tom ? Do you still want to go ? " " I ca n't refuse . I ca n't . Not now we 've got the clearance . " It was on the kitchen table and he picked it up . It read : " EP-HBC cleared to Bandar Delam . Priority flight for urgent spares . Refuel at IIAF Base Isfahan . One crew : Captain Lane . " Lane had been crossed out , and marked , " Sick . Substitutepilot , " then a blank and it was not yet countersigned by McIver . McIver glanced at the kitchen door that was closed , then back to Lochart . " Valik wants to be picked up outside of Tehran , privately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup point ? " " If you get to Bandar Delam , Tom , and that 's not even probable , he 'll pressure you to take them on to Kuwait . " " Of course . " Lochart stared back at McIver . " He 'll use any pressure , family , Sharazad , the lot . Particularly money . " " Millions . In cash  --  which we both know I can use . " Lochart 's voice was level . " But if I fly on to Kuwait without Iranian clearance , in an Iranian registered chopper , without Iranian or company approval , with unauthorized Iranian passengers trying to escape their still legal government , I 'm a hijacker , subject to God knows how many criminal charges here and in Kuwait  --  the Kuwait authorities 'd impound the chopper , shove me in jail , and certainlyextradite me to Iran . In any event I 'd 've blown my future as a pilot and could never come back to Iran and Sharazad  --  SAVAK might even grab her so I 'm not about to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come armed . He could put a gun to your head and force you to go on . " " That 's possible . " Lochart 's voice stayed but his insides were churning . " I have no option . I 've got to help him , and I will  --  but I 'm not goddamn stupid . " After a pause , he added , " Does Nogger know about this ? " " No . " In the watches of the night , after weighing possible plans , McIver had decided to go himself and not risk Nogger Lane or Lochart . The hell with the medical and that I 'd be illegal , he had told himself  --  the whole flight 's mad so a little extra madness wo n't hurt . His plan was simple : after talking it out with Tom Lochart he would just say he had decided not to authorize the flight and would not countersign thep219clearance , that he would drive to the pickup point with enough gasoline for Valik to make the journey by road . Even if Lochart wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix a rendezvous , then never go to it but just drive to Galeg Morghi , put his own name on the clearance as pilot and take off . At the pickup point . . . " What ? " he asked . " There are only three possibilities , " Lochart said again . " You refuse to authorize the flight , you authorize me or you authorize someone else . You 've canceled Nogger , Charlie 's not here , so that leaves you or me . You ca n't go , Mac . You just ca n't , it 's too dangerous . " " Of course I would n't go , my license h  --  " " You ca n't go , Mac , " Lochart said firmly . " Sorry . You just ca n't . " McIver sighed , his wisdom overcame his obsession to fly and he decided on his second plan . " Yes . Yes , you 're right . I agree . So listen carefully : if you want to do it , that 's up to you , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want but there are conditions . If you get to the pickup point and it seems clean , pick them up . Then go on to Isfahan . Valik said he 'd fix that . If Isfahan 's okay , go on . Maybe Mr. Fixit Iran can do just that , all the way . That 's what we 'd have to gamble on . " " That 's what I 'm gambling on . " " Bandar Delam 's the end of the line . You do n't go over the border . Agreed ? " McIver put out his hand . " Agreed , " Lochart said , shaking hands with a prayer that he could keep his promise . McIver told him the pickup point , signed the clearance , and noticed his hands were trembling . If anything goes wrong , guess who SAVAK 'll come after ? Both of us . And even maybe Gen , McIver thought , again filled with dread . He did not tell Lochart that she had overheard Valik last night and figured out the rest . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's terriblyrisky but you 've got to try to help them , Tom too , he 's equally trapped . There is n't any option . " McIver handed Lochart the clearance . " Tom , you 're specifically ordered not to go over the border . If you do , I think you really will lose everything , including Sharazad . " " This whole scheme 's crackpot , but , there you are . " " Yes . Good luck . " Lochart nodded , smiled back at him , and left . McIver closed the front door . I hope that 's the right decision , he thought , his head aching . Madness to go myself , and yet . . . I wish I was going and not him . I wish . . .  | " Oh , " he said , startled . Genny was standing by the kitchen door , a warm robe over her nightdress . She was not wearing her glasses and she peered at him . " I 'm . . . I 'm awfully glad you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny voice . " What ? " " Oh , come on , silly , I know you too well . You hardly slept a wink trying to decide  --  nor did I , worrying about it for you . I know if I 'd been you I 'd 've gone , or wanted to go . But , Duncan , Tom 's strong and he 'll be all right and I do so hope he takes Sharazad and never comes back . . . " The tears began running down her cheeks . " I 'm ever so glad you did n't go . " She brushed the tears away and went to the stove and put on the kettle . " Damn , sorry , I really do get into a tizzy sometimes . Sorry . " He put his arms around her . " Gen , if the 125 comes today , will you get on it ? Please . " " Certainly , dear . If you get on it too . " " But Gen. You must . " " Duncan , listen a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and rested her head against his chest and continued in the same small voice that troubled him greatly , " Three of your partners have already fled with their families and all the money they can , the Shah and his family 've gone with all their money , thousands of others , most of the people we know 've gone , you said so yourself and now if even the great General Valik 's running away , even with all his contacts and they 've got to be on both sides of the fence , and . . . and if even the Immortals have n't squashed the little rebellion at Doshan Tappeh of a few air force cadets and badly armed civilians  --  practicallyon their home ground  --  it 's time we should close down and leave . " 1 " We ca n't , Gen , " he burst out , and she could hear his heart in his chest and her concern for him increased . " That 'd be a disaster . " " It 'd only be for a short time , until things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ruin S-G . " " I do n't know about that , Duncan , but surely the decision 's up to Andy , not you  --  he sent us here . " " Yes , but he 'd ask me what I thought and I could n't recommend quitting and leaving $20- to $30-odd million worth of choppers and spares behind  --  in this mess they would n't last a week , they 'd be looted or damaged , we 'd lose everything , everything  --  do n't forget , Gen , all our retirement money 's tied up in S-G , everything . " " But , Duncan , do n't you think th  --  "  | " I wo n't leave our choppers and spares . " McIver felt flushed and in momentarypanic at the thought . " I just ca n't . " " Then take them with you . " " For God 's sake , we ca n't get ' em out , we ca n't get the clearances , ca n't get off Iranian registry  --  we ca n't we 're stuck here until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duncan , not you or me or our lads , you 've got to think of them too . We have to get out . They 'll throw us out anyway , whoever wins , most of all Khomeini . " A tremor went through her as she thought of his first speech at the cemetery : " I pray God to cut off the hands of all foreigners . . . "  |p222AT  TABRIZ ONE : 9:30 A.M. The red Range Rover came out of the gates of the Khan 's palace and headed down the rise toward Tabriz and the road for Tehran . Erikki was driving , Azadeh beside him . It had been her cousin , Colonel Mazardi , the chief of police , who had persuaded Erikki not to drive to Tehran on Friday : " The road would be highly dangerous  --  it 's bad enough during the day , " he said . " The insurgents wo n't return now , you 're quite safe . Much better to go and see His Highness the Khan and ask his advice . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erikki , of course we will do whatever you want but I would really feel happier if we went home for the night and saw Father . " " My cousin 's right , Captain ; of course you may do as you wish , but I swear by the Prophet , God keep His words safe forever , that Her Highness 's safety is just as important to me as to you . If you still feel so inclined , leave tomorrow . I can assure you there 's no danger here . I 'll post guards . If this so-calledIRAQ QAZVIN *TEHRANp223Rakoczy or any other foreigner or this mullah comes within half a mile of here or the Gorgon palace they 'll regret it . " " Oh , yes , Erikki , please , " Azadeh said enthusiastically . " Of course , my darling , we 'll do whatever you like but it might be you would want to consult Ills Highness , my father , about what you plan to do . " Reluctantly Erikki had agreed . Arberry and the other mechanic , Dibble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spend the weekend there . " Spares 're due Monday , Captain . Old Skinflint McIver knows our 212 's got to be working by Wednesday or he 'll have to send another one and he wo n't like that . We 'll just sit tight and get the job done and get her airborne . Our apology for a base manager can come and fetch us . We 're British , we 've nothing to worry about  --  no one 's going to touch us . And do n't forget we 're working for their guver'ment , whoever 's the bleeding guver'ment , and we 've no quarrel with any of these bleeding wo  --  these bleeders , begging your pardon . Now do n't you worry about us , you and the Missus . We 'll just sit tight and expect you back by Wednesday . Have a fun time in Tehran . " So Erikki had gone in convoy with Colonel Mazardi to the outskirts of Tabriz . The sprawling palace of the Gorgon Khans was set in mountain foothills , in acres of gardens and orchards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house awoke and congregated  --  stepmother , half sisters , nieces , nephews , servants , and children of servants , but not Abdollah Khan , her father . Azadeh was received with open arms and tears and happiness and more tears , and immediate plans were made for a luncheon feast the next day to celebrate their good fortune in having her home at long last  --  " But , oh , how terrible ! Bandits and a rogue mullah daring to come on your land ? Has n't His Highness , our revered father , donated barrels of rials and hundredsof acres of land to various mosques in and around Tabriz ! " Erikki Yokkonen was welcomed politely , and guardedly . All of them were afraid of him , the enormity of his size , his quickness with a knife , the violenceof his temper , and could not understand his gentleness toward his friends and the vast love he radiated for Azadeh . She was the fifth of six half sisters , and an infant half brother . Her mother , dead now many years , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own adored blood brother , Hakim , a year older than she , had been banished by Abdollah Khan and was still in disgrace at Khoi to the northwest  --  banished for crimes against the Khan that both Hakim and Azadeh swore he was not guilty of . " First a bath , " her half sisters said gaily , " and you can tell us all that happened , every detail , every detail . " Happily , they dragged Azadeh away . In the privacy of their bathhouse , warm and intimate and luxurious and com/pletely outside the domain of all men , they chatted and gossiped until the dawn . " My Mahmud has n't made love to me for a week , " Najoud , Azadeh 's eldest half sister , said with a toss of her head . " It has to be another woman , darling Najoud , " someone said . " No , it 's not that . His erection is giving him trouble . " " Oh , you poor darling ! Have you tried giving him oysters . . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Or rubbed him with extract of jacaranda , rhino horn , and musk . . " Jacaranda , musk with rhino horn ? I have n't heard of that one , Fazulia . " " It 's brand new from an ancient recipe from the time of Cyrus the Great . This is a secret but the Great King 's penis was quite small as a young man , but after he conquered the Medes , miraculously it became the envy of the host ! It seems that he obtained a magic potion from the Medes that if rubbed on over a period of a month . . . Their high priest gave it to Cyrus in return for his life , providing the Great King swore to keep the secret in his family alone . It 's come down from father to son over the centuries and now , dear sisters , the secret 's in Tabriz ! " " Oh , who , dearest darling Sister Fazulia , who ? The Blessings of God be upon thee forever , who ? My rotten husband Abdullah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an erection for years . Who ? " " Oh , be quiet , Zadi , how can she talk if you talk ! Go on , Fazulia . " " Yes , be quiet , Zadi , and bless your good fortune  --  my Hussan is erect morning , noon , and night and so filled with desire for me he gives me no time to even wash my teeth ! " " Well , the secret of the elixir was bought by the great-great-grandfather of the present owner at a huge cost , I was told for a fistful of diamonds . . . " " Eeeeeeeeee . . . " . . but now you can buy a small vial for fifty thousand rials ! " " Oh , that 's too much ! Where on earth can I get so much cash ? " " As always you 'll find it in his pockets , and you can always bargain . Isanything too much for such a potion when we ca n't have other men ? " " If it works . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it , dearest dearest Fazulia ? " " In the bazaar , in the shop of Abu Bakra bin Hassan bin Saiidi . I know the way ! We 'll go tomorrow . Before lunch . You will come with us , darling Azadeh ! " " No thank you , dear sister . " Then there was lots of laughter and one of the young ones said , " Poor Azadeh does n't need jacaranda and muck  --  she needs the opposite ! " " Jacaranda and musk , child , with rhino horn , " Fazulia said.  |p225Azadeh  laughed with them . They had all asked her , overtly or covertly , if her husband was equally proportioned and how did she , so skinny and so fragile , deal with it and bear his weight ? " By magic , " she had told the young ones , " easily , " the serious ones , and " with unbelievable ecstasy as it must be in the Garden of Paradise , " the jealous ones and those she hated and secretly wanted to taunt . Not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many had tried to influence her father against him and against her . But she had won and she knew who her enemies were : her sex-mad half sister , Zadi , lying Cousin Fazulia with her nonsense exaggerations , and , most of all , the honeyedviper of the pack , eldest sister Najoud and her vile husband Mahmud , may God punish them for their evil ways . " Dearest Najoud , I 'm so happy to be home , but now it 's time for sleep . " And so to bed . All of them . Some happily , some sadly , some angrily , some hating , some loving , some to their husbands and some alone . Husbands could have four wives , according to the Koran , at the same time , provided they treated each with equality in every way  --  Mohammed the Prophet , alone of all men , had been allowed as many wives as he wished . According to legend , the Prophet had had eleven wives in his lifetime though not all at the same time . Some died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all of them honored him forever . Erikki awoke as Azadeh slipped into bed beside him . " We should leave as early as possible , Azadeh , my darling . " " Yes , " she said , almost asleep now , the bed so comfortable , him so comfortable . " Yes , whenever you like , but please not until after lunch because dearest Stepmother will weep buckets . . . . " " Azadeh ! " But she was asleep now . He sighed , also content , and went back to sleep . They did not leave Sunday as planned  --  her father had said it was inconvenientas he wished to talk to Erikki first . At dawn today , Monday , after prayers that her father had led , and after breakfast  --  coffee and bread and honey and yogurt and eggs  --  they had been allowed to leave and now swung off the mountainside road on to the main Tehran road and there ahead was the roadblock . " That 's weird , " Erikki said . Colonel Mazardi had said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor was the roadblock manned . " Police ! " Azadeh said , with a yawn . " They 're never where you want them . " The road climbed up to the pass . The sky was blue and clear and the tops of the mountains already washed with sunlight . Down here in the valley , itp226was still dark and chill and damp , the road slippery , snow-banked , but this did not worry him as the Range Rover had four-wheel drive and he carried chains . Later , when he came to the base turnoff he passed it by . He knew the base was empty , the 212 safe and waiting for repairs . Before leaving the palace he had tried unsuccessfully to contact his manager , Dayati . But that did not matter . He settled back in his seat , he had full tanks , and six spare five-gallon cans that he had got from Abdollah 's private pump . I can get to Tehran easily today , he thought . And back by Wednesday  --  if I come back . That bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some coffee , darling ? " Azadeh asked . " Thanks . See if you can find the BBC or the VOA on the shortwave . " Gratefully he accepted the hot coffee from the thermos , listening to the crackle of static and heterodyning and loud Soviet stations and little else . Iranian stations were still strikebound and closed down , except the ones worked by the military . Over the weekend friends , relations , tradesmen , servants had brought rumorsand counterrumors of everything from imminent Soviet invasion to imminent U.S. invasion , from successful military coups in the capital to abject submission of all the generals to Khomeini and Bakhtiar 's resignation . " Asinine ! " Abdollah Khan had said . He was a corpulent man in his sixties , bearded , with dark eyes and full mouth , bejeweled and richly dressed . " Why should Bakhtiar resign ? He gains nothing so there 's no reason , yet . " " And if Khomeini wins ? " Erikki had asked . " It is the Will of God . " The Khan was lounging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated in front of him , his armed bodyguard standingbehind him . " But Khomeini 's victory will be only temporary , if he achieves it . The armed forces will curb him and his mullahs , sooner or later . He 's an old man . Soon he will die , the sooner the better , for though he has done God 's will and been the instrument to remove the Shah whose time had come , he 's vindictive , narrow-sighted , as megalomaniacal as the Shah , if not more so . He will surely murder more Iranians than the Shah ever did . " " But is n't he a man of God , pious and everything an ayatollah should be ? " Erikki asked warily , not knowing what to expect . " Why should Khomeini do that ? " " It 's the habit of tyrants . " The Khan laughed and took another of the halvah , the Turkish sweets he gorged on . " And the Shah ? What will happen now ? " As much as Erikki disliked the Khan , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On him depended much of his and Azadeh 's life in Iran and he had no wish to leave . " As God wants . Mohammed Shah did incredibly well for Iran , like hisp227father before him . But in the last few years he was totally curled up in himself and would listen to no one  --  not even the Shahbanu , Empress Farah , who was dedicated to him , and wise . If he had any sense he would abdicate at once in favor of his son Reza . The generals need a rallying point , they could train him until he 's ready to take power  --  do n't forget Iran 's been a monarchyfor almost three thousand years , always an absolute ruler , some might say tyrant , with absolute power and removed only by death . " He had smiled , his lips full and sensuous , " Of the Qajar Shahs , our legitimate dynasty who ruled for a hundred and fifty years , only one , the last of the line , my cousin , died of natural causes . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torture . Life and death are not judged by your standards . " His dark eyes had seemed to grow darker . " Perhaps it is the Will of God that the Qajars will return  --  under their rule Iran prospered . " That 's not what I heard , Erikki had thought . But he held his peace . It 's not up to me to judge what has been or what would be here . All Sunday the BBC and the VOA had been jammed which was not unusual . Radio Moscow was loud and clear , as usual , and Radio Free Iran that broadcast from Tbilisi north of the border also loud and clear as usual . Their reports in Farsi and English told of total insurrection against " Bakhtiar'sillegal government of the ousted Shah and his American masters , headed by the warmonger and liar President Carter . Today Bakhtiar tried to curry favor with the masses by canceling a total of $13 billion of usurious military contracts forced on the country by the deposed Shah : $8 billion in the U.S.A. , British Centurion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactors , and one from Germany worth another $2.7 billion . This news has sent Western leaders into panic and will undoubtedly send capitalist stock markets into a well-deserved crash . . . " " Excuse me for asking , Father , but will the West crash ? " Azadeh had asked . " Not this time , " the Khan had said and Erikki saw his face grow colder . " Not unless the Soviets decide this is the time to renege on the $80 billion they owe Western banks  --  and even some Oriental banks . " He had laughed sardonically , playing with the string of pearls he wore around his neck . " Of course Oriental moneylenders are much cleverer ; at least they 're not so greedy . They lend judiciously and require collaterals and believe no one and certainly not in the myth of Christian charity . ' " It was common knowledge that the Gorgons owned enormous tracts of land in Azerbaijan , good oil land , a large part of Iran-Timber , seafront property on the Caspian , much of the bazaar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the whispers he had heard about Abdollah Khan when he was trying to get permission to marry Azadeh , about his parsimony and ruthlessness in business : " A quick way to Paradise or hell is to owe Abdollah the Cruel one rial , to not pay pleading poverty , and to stay in Azerbaijan . " " Father , please may I ask , cancellation of so many contracts will cause havoc , wo n't it ? " " No , you may not ask . You 've asked enough questions for one day . A woman is supposed to hold her tongue and listen  --  now you can leave . " At once she apologized for her error and left obediently . " Please excuse me . Erikki got up to leave too , but the Khan stopped him : " I have not dismissedyou yet . Sit down . Now , why should you fear one Soviet ? " " I do n't  --  just the system . That man has to be KGB . " " Why did n't you just kill him then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . Us , the base , Iran-Timber , Azadeh , perhaps even you . He was sent to me by others . He knows us  --  knows you . " Erikki had watched the old man carefully . " I know lots of them . Russians , Soviet or tsarist , have always coveted Azerbaijan , but have always been good customers of Azerbaijan  --  and helped us against the stinking British . I prefer them to British , I understand them . " His smile thinned even more . " It would be easy to remove this Rakoczy . " " Good , then do it , please . " Erikki had laughed full-throated . " And all of them as well . That would really be doing God 's work . " " I do n't agree , " the Khan said ill-temperedly . " That would be doing Satan 's work . Without the Soviets against them , the Americans and their dogs the British would dominate us and all the world . They 'd certainly eat up Iran  --  under Mohammed Shah they nearly did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no check on America 's foul policies , foul arrogance , foul manners , foul jeans , foul music , foul food , and foul democracy , their disgusting attitudes to women , to law and order , their disgusting pornography , naive attitude to diplomacy , and their evil , yes , that 's the correct word , their evil antagonism to Islam . " The last thing Erikki wanted was another confrontation . In spite of his resolve , he felt his own rage gathering . " We had an agreem  --  " " It 's true , by God ! " Khan shouted at him . " It 's true ! " " It 's not , and we had an agreement before your God and my spirits that we 'd not discuss politics  --  either of your world or mine . " " It 's true , admit it ! " Abdollah Khan snarled , his face twisted with rage . One hand went to the ornamental knife at his belt , and at once the guardp229unslung his machine pistol and covered Erikki . " By Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he bellowed . Erikki said through his teeth , " I only remind you , Highness , by your Allah , what we agreed ! " The dark bloodshot eyes stared at him . He stared back , ready to go for his own knife and kill or be killed , the danger between them very great . " Yes , yes , that 's also true , " the Khan muttered , and the fit of rage passed as quickly as it had erupted . He looked at the guard , angrily waved him away . " Get out ! " Now the room was very still . Erikki knew there were other guards nearby and spyholes in the walls . He felt the sweat on his forehead and the touch of his pukoh knife in the center of his back . Abdollah Khan knew the knife was there and that Erikki would use it without hesitation . But the Khan had given him perpetual permission to be armed with it in his presence . Two years ago Erikki had saved his life . That was the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imperiously turned down : " No , by Allah , I want no infidels in my family . Leave my house ! For the last time ! " Erikki had got up from the carpet , sick at heart . At that moment there had been a scuffle outside the door , then shots , the door had burst open and two men , assassins armed with machine guns , had rushed in , others fighting a gun battle in the corridor . The Khan 's bodyguard had killed one , but the other sprayed him with bullets then turned his gun on Abdollah Khan who sat on the carpet in shock . Before the assassin could pull the trigger a second time , he died , Erikki 's knife in his throat . At the same moment Erikki lunged for him , ripped the gun out of his hands and the knife out of his throat as another assassin rushed into the room firing . Erikki had smashed the machine gun into the man 's face , killing him , almost tearing off his head with the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three attackers and two of the bodyguards were dead or dying . The last of the attackers took to their heels , but Erikki cut them both down and raced onward . And only when he had found Azadeh and saw that she was safe did the bloodlust go out of his head and he become calm again . Erikki remembered how he had left her and had gone back to the same Great Room . Abdollah Khan still sat on the carpets . " Who were those men ? " " Assassins  --  enemies , like the guards who let them in , " Abdollah Khan had said malevolently . " It was the Will of God you were here to save my life , the Will of God that I am alive . You may marry Azadeh , yes , but because I do not like you , we will both swear before God and your  --  whatever youp230worship  --  not to discuss religion or politics , either of your world or mine , then perhaps I will not have to have you killed . " And now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khan clapped his hands . Instantly the door opened and a servant appeared . " Bring coffee ! " The man hurried away . " I will drop the subject of your world and go to another we can discuss : my daughter , Azadeh . " Erikki became even more on guard , not sure of the extent of her father 's control over her , or his own rights as her husband while he was in Azerbaijan  --  very much the old man 's fief . If Abdollah Khan really ordered Azadeh back to this house and to divorce him , would she ? I think yes , I 'm afraid yes  --  she certainly will never hear a word against him . She even defended his paranoiac hatred of America by explaining what had caused it : " He was ordered there , to university , by his father , " she had told him . " He had a terrible time in America , Erikki , learning the language and trying to get a degree in economics which his father demanded before he was allowed home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he could n't play their games , because he was heavier than they which in Iran is a sign of wealth but not in America , and was slow at learning . But most of all because of the hazing that he was forced to endure , forced , Erikki  --  to eat unclean things like pork that are against our religion , to drink beer and wine and spirits that are against our religion , to do unmentionable things and be called unmentionable names . I would be angry too if it had been me . Please be patient with him . Do n't Soviets make a blood film come over your eyes and heart for what they did to your father and mother and country ? Be patient with him , I beg you . Has n't he agreed to our marriage ? Be patient with him . " I 've been very patient , Erikki thought , more patient than with any man , wishing the interview was over . " What about my wife , Highness ? " It was custom to call him that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abdollah Khan smiled a thin smile at him . " Naturally my daughter 's futureinterests me . What is your plan when you go to Tehran ? " " I have no plan . I just think it is wise to get her out of Tabriz for a few days . Rakoczy said they require ' my services . When the KGB says that in Iran or Finland or even America , you 'd better clear the decks and prepare for trouble . If they kidnapped her , I would be putty in their hands . " " They could kidnap her in Tehran much more easily than here , if that is their scheme  --  you forget this is Azerbaijan "  --  his lips twisted with contempt  --  " not Bakhtiar country . " Erikki felt helpless under the scrutiny . " I only know that 's what I think isp231best for her . I said I would guard her with my life , and I will . Until the political future of Iran is settled  --  by you and other Iranians  --  I think it 's the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " her father had said with a suddenness that had almost frightened him . " Should you need help send me the code words . . . " He thought a moment . Then his smile became sardonic : " Send me the sentence : ' All men are created equal . ' That 's another truth , is n't it ? " " I do n't know , Highness , " he said carefully . " If it is or if it is n't , it 's surely the Will of God . " Abdollah had laughed abruptly and got up and left him alone in the Great Room and Erikki had felt a chill on his soul , deeply unsettled by the man whose thoughts he could never read . " Are you cold , Erikki ? " Azadeh asked . " Oh . No , no , not at all , " he said , coming out of his reverie , the sound of the engine good as they climbed up the mountain road toward the pass . Now they were just below the crest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner they came into sunshine and topped the rise ; at once Erikki shifted gears smoothly and picked up speed as they began the long descent , the road  --  built at the order of Reza Shah , like the railway  --  a wonderof engineering with cuts and embankments and bridges and steep parts with no railings on the precipice side , the surface slippery , snow-banked . He shifted gears again , driving fast but prudently , very glad they had not driven by night . " May I have some more coffee ? " Happily she gave it to him . " I 'll be glad to see Tehran . There 's lots of shopping to be done , Sharazad 's there , and I have a list of things for my sisters and some face cream for Stepmother . . . " He hardly listened to her , his mind on Rakoczy , Tehran , McIver , and the next step . The road twisted and curled in its descent . He slowed and drove more cautiously , some traffic behind him . In the lead was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close , too fast , and with his finger permanently on the horn even when it was clearly impossible to move out of the way . Erikki closed his ears to the impatience that he had never become used to , or to the reckless way Iranians drove , even Azadeh . He rounded the next blind corner , the gradient steepening , and there on the straight , not far ahead , was a heavily laden truck grinding upward with a car overtaking on the wrong side . He braked , hugging the mountainside . At that moment the car behind him accelerated , swerved around him , horn blaring , overtaking blindly , and hurtled down the wrong side of the curving road . The two carsp232smashed into each other and both careened over the precipice to fall five hundred feet and burst into flames . Erikki swung closer into the side and stopped . The oncoming truck did not stop , just lumbered past and continued up the hill as though nothing had happened  --  so did the other traffic . He stood at the edge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were spread over the mountainside down six or seven hundred feet , no possibility of survivors , and no chance to get down there without serious climbing gear . When he came back to the car he shook his head unhappily . " Insha'Allah , my darling , " Azadeh said calmly . " It was the Will of God . " " No , it was n't , it was blatant stupidity . " " Of course you 're right , Beloved , it certainly was blatant stupidity , " she said at once in her most calming voice , seeing his anger though not understandingit as she did not understand much that went on in the head of this strange man who was her husband . " You 're perfectly right , Erikki . It was blatant stupidity but the Will of God that those drivers ' stupidity caused their deaths and the deaths of those who traveled with them . It was the Will of God or the road would have been clear . You were quite right . " " Was I ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erikki . You were perfectly right . " They went on . The villages that lay beside the road or straddled it were poor or very poor with narrow dirt streets , crude huts and houses , high walls , a few drab mosques , street stores , goats and sheep and chickens , and flies not yet the plague they would become in summer . Always refuse in the streets and in the joub  --  the ditches  --  and the inevitable scavenging packs of scabrousdespised dogs that frequently were rabid . But snow made the landscape and the mountains picturesque , and the day continued to be good though cold with blue skies and cumulus building . Inside the Range Rover it was warm and comfortable . Azadeh wore padded , modern ski gear and a cashmere sweater underneath , matching blue , and short boots . Now she took off her jacket and her neat woolen ski cap , and her full-flowing , naturally wavy dark hair fell to her shoulders . Near noon they stopped for a picnic lunch beside a mountain stream . In the early afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry trees , now bleak and leafless and naked in the landscape , then came to the outskirts of Qazvin , a town of perhaps 150,000 inhabitants and many mosques . " How many mosques are there in all Iran , Azadeh ? " he asked . " Once I was told twenty thousand , " she answered sleepily , opening her eyes and peering ahead . " Ah , Qazvin ! You 've made good time , Erikki . " A yawn swamped her and she settled more comfortably and went back into halfp233sleep . " There 're twenty thousand mosques and fifty thousand mullahs , so they say . At this rate we 'll be in Tehran in a couple of hours . . . He smiled as her words petered out . He was feeling more secure now , glad that the back of the journey had been broken . The other side of Qazvin the road was good all the way to Tehran . In Tehran , Abdollah Khan owned many houses and apartments , most of them rented to foreigners . A few he kept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erikki that , this time , because of the troubles , they could stay in an apartment not far from McIver . " Thanks , thanks very much , " Erikki had said and later Azadeh had said , " I wonder why he was so kind . It 's . . . it 's not like him . He hates you and hates me whatever I try to do to please him . " " He does n't hate you , Azadeh . " " I apologize for disagreeing with you , but he does . I tell you again , my darling , it was my eldest sister , Najoud , who really poisoned him against me , and against my brother . She and her rotten husband . Do n't forget my mother was Father 's second wife and almost half Najoud 's mother 's age and twice as pretty and though my mother died when I was seven , Najoud still keeps up the poison  --  of course not to our face , she 's much more clever than that . Erikki , you can never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how vengeful behind their oh so sweet exterior . Najoud 's worse than the snake in the Garden of Eden ! She 's the cause of all the enmity . " Her lovely blue-green eyes filled with tears . " When I was little , my father truly loved us , my brother Hakim and me , and we were his favorites . He spent more time with us in our house than in the palace . Then , when Mother died , we went to live in the palace but none of my half brothers and sisters really liked us . When we went into the palace , everything changed , Erikki . It was Najoud . " " Azadeh , you tear yourself apart with this hatred  --  you suffer , not her . Forget her . She 's got no power over you now and I tell you again : you 've no proof . " " I do n't need proof . I know . And I 'll never forget . " Erikki had left it there . There was no point in arguing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and many tears . Better it 's in the open than buried , better to let her rave from time to time . Ahead now the road left the fields and entered Qazvin , a city like most every other Iranian city , noisy , cramped , dirty , polluted , and traffic-jammed . Beside the road were the joub that skirted most roads in Iran . Here the ditches were three feet deep , in parts concreted , with slush and ice and a little water trickling down them . Trees grew out of them , townsfolk washed their clothes in them , sometimes used them as a source of drinking water , orp234as a sewer . Beyond the ditches the walls began . Walls that hid houses or gardens , big or small , rich or eyesores . Usually the town and city houses were two floors , drab and boxlike , some brick , adobe , some plastered , and almost all of them hidden . Most had dirt floors , a few had running water , electricity , and some sanitation . Traffic built up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cars of all sizes and makes and ages from ancient to very old , almost all dented and patched , some highly decorated with different-colored paints and small lights to suit the owners ' fancy . Erikki had driven this way many times over the last few years and he knew the bottlenecks that could happen . But there was no other way , no detour around the city though one had been planned for years . He smiled scornfully , trying to shut his ears to the noise , and thought , There 'll never be a detour , the Qazvinis could n't stand the quiet . Qazvinis and Rashtians  --  people from Rasht on the Caspian  --  were the butts of many Iranian jokes . He skirted a burned-out wreck , then put in a cassette of Beethoven and turned the volume up to soothe the noise away . But it did n't help much . " This traffic 's worse than usual ! Where are the police ? " Azadeh said , wide awake now . " Are you thirsty ? " " No , no thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tumbling hairenhancing her . He grinned . " But I 'm hungry  --  hungry for you ! " She laughed and took his arm . " I 'm not hungry  --  just ravenous ! " " Good . " They were content together . As usual the road surface was bad . Here and there it was torn up  --  partially because of wear , partially because of never-ending repairs and road works though these rarely were signposted or had safety barriers . He skirted a deep hole then eased past another wreck that had been shoved carelessly into the side . As he did so a crumpled truck came from the other direction , its horn blaring angrily . It was brightly decorated , the fenders tied up with wire , the cab open and glassless , a piece of cloth the tank cap . On the flatbed was brushwood , piled high , with three passengers hanging on precariously . The driver was huddled up and wrapped in a ragged sheepskin coat . Two other men were beside him . As Erikki passed he was surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battered , overladen bus lumbered toward him . With great care he went closer to the joub , hugging the side to give the bus room , his wheels on the rim , and stopped . Again he saw the driver and all the passengers stare at him as they passed , women in their chadors , young men , bearded and clothed heavily against the cold . One of them shook his fist at him . Another shouted a curse . We 've never had any trouble before , Erikki thought uneasily . Everywherep235he looked were the same angry glances . From the street and from the vehicles . He had to go very slowly because of the swarms of rogue motorcycles , bicycles , among the cars , buses , and trucks , in single lanes that fought for space  --  obedient to no traffic laws other than those which pleased the individual  --  andnow a flock of sheep poured out of a side street to clutter the road , the motorists screaming abuse at the herdsmen , the herdsmen screamingabuse back and everyone angry and impatient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Azadeh said impatiently , wide awake now . " Sound your horn , Erikki ! " " Be patient , go back to sleep . There 's no way I can overtake anyone , " he shouted over the tumult , conscious of the unfriendliness that surrounded them . " Be patient ! " Another three hundred yards took half an hour , other traffic coming from both sides to join the stream that got slower and slower . Street vendors and pedestrians and refuse . Now he was inching along behind a bus that took up most of the roadway , almost scraping cars on the other side , most times with one wheel half over the lip of the joub . Motorcyclists shoved past carelessly , banging the sides of the Range Rover and other vehicles , cursing each other and everyone else , pushing and kicking the sheep out of the way , stampeding them . From behind , a small car nudged him , then the driver jammed his hand on his horn in a paroxysm of rage that sent a sudden shaft of anger into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Be calm ! There 's nothing you can do ! Be calm ! But he found it increasingly difficult . After half an hour the sheep turned off into an alley , and traffic picked up a little . Then around the next corner the whole roadway was dug up and an unmarked ten-foot ditch  --  some six feet deep and half-filled with water  --  barred the way . A group of insolent workmen squatted nearby , hurling back abuse . And obscene gestures . It was impossible to go forward or back , so all traffic had to detour into a narrow side street , the bus ahead not making the turn , having to stop and reverse to more screams of rage and more tumult and when Erikki backed to give it room , a battered blue car behind him swerved around him on the opposite side of the road into the small opening ahead and forced the oncomingcar to brake suddenly and skid . One of its wheels sank into the joub and the whole car tipped dangerously . Now traffic was totally snarled . Enraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , and went over to the car in the ditch and used his great strength to drag it back on the road . No one else helped , just swore and added to the uproar . Then he strode for the blue car . At that moment the bus made the corner and now there was roomp236to move , the driver of the blue car let in his clutch and roared off with an obscene gesture . With an effort Erikki unclenched his fists . Traffic on both sides of the road was honking at him . He got into the driver 's seat and let in the clutch . " Here , " Azadeh said uneasily . She gave him a cup of coffee . " Thanks . " He drank it , driving with one hand , the traffic slowing again . The blue car had vanished . When he could talk calmly , he said , " If I 'd got my hands on him or his car I 'd have torn it and him to pieces . " " Yes . Yes , I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? So angry ? " " Yes , yes , I have . " " But why ? We 've driven though Qazvin twenty tim  --  " Azadeh ducked involuntarily as refuse suddenly hit her window , then lurched across into his protection , frightened . He cursed and rolled up the windows , then reached across her and locked her door . Dung hit the windshield . " What the hell 's up with these matyeryebyets ? " he muttered . " It 's as though we 've an American flag flying and we 're waving pictures of the Shah . " A stone came out of nowhere and ricocheted off the metal sides . Then , ahead , the bus broke out of the narrow side-street diversion into the wide square in front of a mosque where there were market stalls and two lanes of traffic on either side . To Erikki 's relief they picked up some speed . The traffic was still heavy but it was moving and he got into second , heading for the Tehran exit the far side of the square . Halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vehicles joined those heading for the Tehran road . " It 's never been this bad , " he muttered . " What the hell 's the holdup for ? " " It must be another accident , " Azadeh said , very unsettled . " Or road works . Should we turn back  --  the traffic 's not so bad that way ? " " We 've plenty of time , " he said , encouraging her . " We 'll be out of here in a minute . Once through the town we 'll be fine . " Ahead everything was slowing again , the din picking up . The two lanes were clogging , gradually becoming one again with much hooting , swearing , stopping , starting again and grinding along at about ten miles an hour , street stores and pushcarts encroaching the roadway and straddling the joub . They were almost at the exit when some youths ran alongside , began shouting insults , some foul . One of the youths banged on his side window . " American dog . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by others and some women in chador , fists raised . Erikki was bottled in and could not get out of the traffic or speed up or slow down nor could he turn around and he felt rage growing at his helplessness.  |p237Some  of the men were banging on the hood and sides of the Range Rover and on his window . Now there was a pack of them and those on Azadeh 's side were taunting her , making obscene gestures , trying to open the door . One of the youths jumped on the hood but slipped and fell off and just managed to scramble out of the way before Erikki drove over him . The bus ahead stopped . Immediately there was a frantic melee as would-be passengers fought to get on and others fought to get off . Then Erikki saw an opening , stamped on the accelerator throwing off another man , got around the bus , just missing pedestrians who carelessly flooded through the traffic , and swung into a side street that miraculously was clear , raced up it and cut into another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Soon he was quite lost , for there was no pattern to the city or town except refuse and stray dogs and traffic , but he took his bearings from the sun 's shadows and at length came out onto a wider road , shoved his way into the traffic and around it , and soon came onto a road that he recognized , one that took him into another square in front of another mosque and then back on the Tehran road . " We 're all right now , Azadeh , they were just hooligans . " " Yes , " she said shakily . " They should be whipped . " Erikki had been studying the crowds near the mosque and on the streets and in the vehicles , trying to find a clue to the untoward hostility . Something'sdifferent , he thought . What is it ? Then his stomach twisted . " I have n't seen a soldier or an army truck ever since we left Tabriz  --  none . Have you ? " " No  --  no , not now that you mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " War ? The Soviets have come over the border ? " Her face lost even more color . " I doubt it  --  there 'd be troops going north , or planes . " He looked at her . " Never mind , " he said , more to convince himself , " we 're going to have a fine time in Tehran , Sharazad 's there and lots of your friends . It 's about time you had a change . Maybe I 'll take the leave I 'm owed  --  we could go to Finland for a week or two . . . " They were out of the downtown area and into the suburbs now . The suburbs were ramshackled , with the same walls and houses and the same potholes . Here the Tehran road widened to four lanes , two each side , and though traffic was still heavy and slow , barely fifteen miles an hour , he was not concerned . A little way ahead , the Abadan-Kermanshah road branched off southwest , and he knew that this would bleed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauges as he would his cockpit instrumentsand , not for the first time , he wished he was airborne , over and out ofp238all this mess . The gas gauge registered under a quarter full . Soon he would have to refuel but that would be no problem with plenty of spare fuel aboard . They slowed to ease past another truck parked with careless arrogance near some street vendors , the air heavy with the smell of diesel . Then more refuse came out of nowhere to splatter their windshield . " Perhaps we should turn around , Erikki , and go back to Tabriz . Perhaps we could skirt Qazvin . " " No , " he said , finding it eerie to hear fear in her voice  --  normally she was fearless . " No , " he repeated even more kindly . " We 'll go to Tehran and find out what the problem is , then we 'll decide . " She moved closer to him and put a hand on his knee . " Those hooligans frightened me . God curse them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turquoise beads she wore around her neck . Most Iranian women wore turquoise or blue beads , or a single blue stone against the evil eye . " Those sons of dogs ! Why should they be like that ? Devils . May God curse them forever ! " Just outside the city was a big army training camp and an adjoining air base . " Why are n't soldiers here ? " " I 'd like to know too , " he said . The Abadan-Kermanshah turnoff came up on his right . Much of the traffic headed down it . Barbed-wire fences skirted both roads  --  as on most of the main roads and highways in Iran . The fences were needed to keep sheep and goats and cattle and dogs  --  and people  --  from straying across the roads . Accidentswere very frequent and mortality high . But that 's normal for Iran , Erikki thought . Like those poor fools who went over the side in the mountains  --  no one to know , no one to report them or even to bury them . Except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the city behind them , they felt better . The country opened up again , orchards once more beyond the joub and the barbed wire . The Elburz Mountainsnorth and undulating country south . But instead of speeding up , his two lanes slowed even more and congested , then reluctantly became one again , with more jostling , hooting , and rage . Wearily he cursed the inevitable roadworksthat must be causing the bottleneck , shifted down , his hands and feet working smoothly of their own volition , hardly noticing the stopping and starting , stopping and starting , inching along again , engines grinding and overheating , noise and frustration building in every vehicle . Abruptly Azadeh pointed ahead . " Look ! " A hundred yards ahead was a roadblock . Groups of men surrounded it . Some were armed , all were civilians and poorly dressed . The roadblock was just this side of a nondescript village with street stalls beside the road and in the meadow opposite . Villagers , women and children , mingled with the men.  |p239All  the women wore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers were checked and then it was allowed to pass . Several cars had been pulled off the road into the meadow where knots of men interrogated the occupants . Erikki saw more weapons among them . " They 're not Green Bands , " he said . " There are n't any mullahs . Can you see any mullahs ? " " No . " " Then they 're Tudeh or mujhadin  --  or fedayeen . " " Better get your Identity Card ready , " he said and smiled at her . " Put on your parka so you wo n't catch cold when I open the windows , and your hat . " It was n't the cold that worried him . It was the curve of her breasts , proud under the sweater , the delicacy of her waist and her free-flowing hair . In the glove compartment was a small , sheathed pukoh knife . This he concealed in his right boot . The other one , his big knife , was under his parka , in the center of his back . When at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Range Rover . A few had U.S. rifles , one an AK47 . Among them were some women , just faces in the chador . They peered up at her with beady eyes and grim disapproval . " Papers , " one of the men said in Farsi , holding out his hand , his breath reeking , the pervading smell of unwashed clothes and bodies coming into the car . Azadeh stared ahead , trying to dismiss the leers and mutterings and closeness that were totally outside her experience . Politely Erikki passed over his ID card and Azadeh 's . The man accepted them , stared at them , and passed them to a youth who could read . All the others waited silently , staring , stamping their feet in the cold . At length the youth said , his Farsi coarse , " He 's a foreigner from somewhere called Finland . He comes from Tabriz . He 's not American . " " He looks American , " someone else said . " The woman 's called Gorgon , she 's his wife . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm his wife , " Azadeh said curtly . " Ca  --  " " Who asked you ? " the first man said rudely . " Your family name 's Gorgon which is a landowning name and your accent 's high and mighty like your manner and more than likely you 're an enemy of the People . " " I 'm an enemy of no one . Pl  --  " " Shut up . Women are supposed to know manners and be chaste and cover themselves and be obedient even in a socialist state . " The man turned on Erikki . " Where are you going ? " " What 's he say , Azadeh ? " Erikki asked . She translated.  | " Tehran , " he said quietly to the thug . " Azadeh , tell him we go to Tehran . " He had counted six rifles and one automatic . Traffic hemmed him in , no way to break out . Yet . She did so , adding , " My husband does not speak Farsi . " " How do we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where is your marriage certificate ? " " I do n't have it with me . That I 'm married is attested on my Identity Card . " " But this is a Shah card . An illegal card . Where is your new card ? " " A card from whom ? Signed by whom ? " she said fiercely . " Give us back our cards and allow us to pass ! " Her strength had an effect on him and the others . The man hesitated . " You will understand , please , that there are many spies and enemies of the People that must be caught . . . " Erikki could feel his heart pumping . Sullen faces , people out of the Dark Ages . Ugly . More men joined the group around them . One of them angrily and noisily waved the cars and trucks behind him ahead to be checked . No one was honking . Everyone waited their turn . And over the whole traffic jam was a silent brooding dread . " What 's going on here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others gave way to him deferentially . Over his shoulder was a Czechoslovakian machine gun . The other man explained and gave over the papers . The squat man 's face was round and unshaven , his eyes dark , his clothes poor and filthy . A sudden shot rang out and all heads turned to look at the meadow . A man was lying on the ground beside a small passenger car that had been pulled over by the hostiles . One of these men stood over him with an automatic . Another passenger was pressed against the side of the car with his hands over his head . Abruptly this man burst through the cordon and dashed away . The man with the gun raised it and fired , missed and fired again . This time the running man screamed and fell , writhing in agony , tried to scramble away , his legs useless now . Leisurely the man with the gun came up to him , emptied the magazine into him , killing him by stages . " Ahmed ! " the squat man shouted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well . Who are they ? " " SAVAK ! " A murmur of satisfaction swept the crowd and villagers and someone cheered . " Fool ! Then why kill them so quickly , eh ? Bring me their papers . " " The sons of dogs had papers claiming they were Tehrani businessmen but I know a SAVAK man when I see one . Do you want the false papers ? "  | " No . Tear them up . " The squat man turned back to Erikki and Azadeh . " So it is that enemies of the People will be smoked out and done with . " She did not reply . Their own IDs were in the grubby hand . What if our papers are also considered false ? Insha'Allah ! When the squat man finished scrutinizing the IDs he stared at Erikki . Then at her . " You claim you 're Azadeh Gorgon Yok . . . Yokkonen  --  his wife ? " " Yes . " " Good . " He stuffed their IDs in his pocket and jerked a thumb at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will search your car . " " But th  --  " " Do it . NOW ! " The squat man climbed onto the fender , his boots scratching the paintwork . " What 's that ? " he asked , pointing to the blue cross on a white background that was painted on the roof . " It 's the Finnish flag , " Azadeh said . " My husband 's Finnish . " " Why is it there ? " " It pleases him to have it there . " The squat man spat , then pointed again toward the meadow . " Hurry up ! Over there . " When they were in an empty spot , the crowd following them , he slid off . " Out . I want to search your car for arms and contraband . " Azadeh said , " We have no guns or contr  --  " " Out ! And you , woman , you hold your tongue ! " The crones in the crowd hissed approvingly . Angrily he jerked a thumb at the two bodies left crumpledin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and final and do n't forget it . " He stabbed a finger at Erikki . " Tell your monster husband what I said  --  if he is your husband . " " Erikki , he says , the People 's . . . the People 's justice is quick and final and do n't forget it . Be careful , my darling . We , we have to get out of the car  --  they want to search the car . " " All right . But slide over and come out my side . " Towering above the crowd , Erikki got out . Protectively , he put his arm around her , men , women , and some children crowding them , giving them little space . The stench of unwashed bodies was overpowering . He could feel her trembling , as much as she tried to hide it . Together they watched the squat man and others clamberinginto their spotless car , muddy boots on the seats . Others unlocked the rear door , carelessly removing and scattering their possessions , grubby hands reaching into pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then one of the men held up her filmy underclothes and night things to catcalls and jeers . The crones muttered their disapproval . One of them reached out and touched her hair . Azadeh backed away but those behind her would not givep242her room . At once Erikki moved his bulk to help but the mass of the crowd did not move though those nearby cried out , almost crushed by him , their cries infuriating the others who moved closer , threateningly , shouting at him . Suddenly Erikki knew truly , for the first time , he could not protect Azadeh . He knew he could kill a dozen of them before they overpowered and killed him , but that would not protect her . The realization shattered him . His legs felt weak and he had an overpowering wish to urinate and the smell of his own fear choked him and he fought the panic that pervaded him . Dully he watched their possessions being defiled . Men were staggering away with their vital cans of gasoline without which he could never make Tehran as all gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs into motion but they would not work , nor would his mouth . Then one of the crones shouted at Azadeh who numbly shook her head and men took up the cry , jostling him and jostling her , men closing on him , their fetid smell filling his nostrils , his ears clogged with the Farsi . His arm was still around her , and in the noise she looked up and he saw her terror but could not hear what she said . Again he tried to ease more room for the two of them but again he failed . Desperately he tried to contain the soaring , claustrophobic , panic-savagery and need to fight beginning to overwhelmhim , knowing that once he began it would start the riot that would destroy her . But he could not stop himself and lashed out blindly with his free elbow as a thickset peasant woman with strange , enraged eyes pushed though the cordon and thrust the chador into Azadeh 's chest , spitting out a paroxysm of Farsi at her , diverting attention from the man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his chest caved in from Erikki 's blow . The crowd was shouting at her and at him , clearly telling her to put on the chador , Azadeh crying out , " No , no , leave me alone . . . " completely disoriented . In her whole life she had never been threatened like this , never been in a crowd like this , never experienced such closeness of peasants , or such hostility . " Put it on , harlot . . . " " In the Name of God , put on the chador . . . " " Not in the Name of God , woman , in the name of the People . " God is Great , obey the word . . . " " Piss on God , in the name of the revolution . . . " " Cover your hair , whore and daughter of a whore . " Obey the Prophet whose Name be praised . . . " The shouting increased and the jostling , their feet trampling the dyingp243man on the ground , then someone tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his other hand go for the big knife and she screamed out , " Do n't , do n't , Erikki , they 'll kill you . . . In panic she pushed the peasant woman away and fought the chador into place , calling out repeatedly , " Allah-u Akbarrr , " and this mollified those nearby somewhat , their jeers subsiding , though people at the back shoved forward to see better , crushing others against the Range Rover . In the melee Erikki and Azadeh gained a little more space around them though they were still trapped on all sides . She did not look up at him , just clutched him , shivering like a frozen puppy , enveloped in the coarse shroud . A roar of laughter as one of the men held her bra against his chest and minced around . The vandalism went on until , suddenly , Erikki sensed a newness surroundingthem . The squat man and his followers had stopped and they were looking fixedly toward Qazvin . As he watched he saw them begin to melt into the crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadblock were getting into cars and heading off down the Tehran road , picking up speed . Now villagers also stared toward the city , then others , until the whole crowd was transfixed . Approaching up the road , through the snarled lines of traffic , was another mob of men , mullahs at their head . Some of the mullahs and many of the men were armed . " Allah-u Akbar , " they shouted , " God and Khomeiniiiii ! " then broke into a run , charging the roadblock . A few shots rang out , the fire was returned from the roadblock , the opposingforces clashed with staves , stones , iron bars , and some guns . Everyone else scattered . Villagers rushed for the protection of their homes , drivers and passengers fled from their cars for the ditches or lay on the ground . The cries and countercries and shots and noise and screams of this minor skirmish snapped Erikki 's paralysis . He shoved Azadeh toward their car , hastilypicking up the nearest of their scattered possessions , throwing them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of the villagers began scavenging too but he shoved them out of the way , jumped into the driver 's seat and gunned the engine , jerked the car into reverse , then ahead , then roared off across the meadow , paralleling the road . Just ahead and to the right he saw the squat man with three of his followers getting into a car and remembered that the man still had their papers . For a split second he consideredstopping but instantly rejected the thought and held course for the trees that skirted the road . But then he saw the squat man pull the machine gun off his shoulder , aim , and fire . The burst was a little high and Erikki 's maddenedreflexes swung the wheel over and shoved his foot on the accelerator as he charged the gun . Their massive bumper rammed the man against the car broadside , crushing him and it , the machine gun firing until the magazinep244was spent , bullets howling off metal , splaying through the windshield , the Range Rover now a battering ram . Berserk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killing them , and he would have got out and continued the carnage with his bare hands but then , in the rearview mirror , he saw men running for him and so he reversed and fled . The Range Rover was built for this sort of terrain , its snow tires gripping the surface of the rough ground . In a moment they were in the trees and safe from capture , and he turned for the road , shifted into low , locked both differentials and clambered over the deep joub , ripping the barbed-wire fence apart . Once on the road he unlocked the differentials , changed gear , and whirled away . Only when he was well away did the blood clear from his eyes . Aghast , he remembered the howl of the bullets spraying the car , and that Azadeh was with him . In panic he looked across at her . But she was all right though paralyzed with fear and hunched down in the seat , hanging on with both hands to the side , bullet holes in the glass and roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a moment , saw just an Iranian face made ugly by the chador  --  like any one of the tens of thousands they had all seen in the mobs . " Oh , Azadeh , " he gasped , then reached over and pulled her to him , drivingwith one hand . In a moment he slowed and pulled over to the side and held her to him as the sobs tore her . He did not notice that the fuel gauge read near empty , or that the traffic was building up , or the hostile looks of the passersby , or that many cars contained revolutionaries fleeing their roadblock for Tehran.  |p245AT  ZAGROS THREE : 3:18 P.M. The four men were lying on toboggans , racing down the slope behind the base , Scot Gavallan slightly in the lead of Jean-Luc Sessonne who was neck and neck with Nasiri , their base manager , with Nitchak Khan trailing some twenty yards . This was a challengematch arranged by Jean-Luc , Iran against the World , and all four men were excitedly trying to maximize their speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of hard pack  --  and trackless . They had all climbed to the crest behind the base with Rodrigues and a villager as starting marshals . The winner 's prize was 5,000 rials  --  about $60  --  and one of Lochart 's bottles of whisky : " Tom wo n't mind , " Jean-Luc had said grandly . " He 's having extra leave , enjoying the fleshpots of Tehran while we have to stay on base ! Me , am I not in command ? Of course . This commander is commandeering the bottle for the glory of France , the good of my troops , and our glorious overlords , the Yazdek Kash'kai , " he had added to general cheers.  |p246It  was a wonderful , sunny afternoon , here at seventy-five hundred feet , the sky cloudless and deep blue , air crisp . In the night the snow had stopped . Ever since Lochart had left to go to Tehran three days before , it had been snowing . Now the base and the bowl of mountains were a fairyland of pine and snow and crests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh powder . As the racers came lower , the slope steepened even disappearing under the spray of snowflakes , all exhilarated , flat-out , and determined to win . Ahead now were clumps of pine trees . Scot braked neatly with the toes of his ski boots , his mittened hands gripping the curved front supports , and arced gracefully around the trees , banked again , and began to swoop down the last great slope toward the finish line far below where the rest of the base and villagers were cheering them on . Nasiri and Jean-Luc braked a fraction later , came around the trees just a fraction faster , banked in a cascade of snow and gained on him , now only inches between the three of them . Nitchak Khan did not brake at all , or make the diversion . He commended himself to God for the hundredth time , closed his eyes and went barreling into the pines . " Insha'Allahhhh ! " He passed the first tree safely by a foot , the next by half a foot , opened his eyes just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plowed through a dozen saplings gaining speed , abruptly soared into the air over a bump to clear miraculously a fallen tree , and slam back to earth once more in a chestachingthump that almost crushed the air out of him . But he hung on , rearing up , heeled over on one runner for a second , got his balance back and now he burst out of the forest faster than the others , straighter than the others , ten yards ahead of the others to a roar from all the villagers . The four racers were converging now , hugging their toboggans for just that extra little speed , Scot , Nasiri , and Jean-Luc gaining on Nitchak Khan , closer and closer . Here the snow was not so good and some small moguls bounced them , making them hold on tighter . Two hundred yards to go , one hundred  --  the men from the base and the villagers cheering and begging God for victory  --  now eighty , seventy , sixty , fifty , and then . . . The great mogul was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail up out of control and come down broadside , the wind knocked out of him , then Scot and Jean-Luc both whirled into the air to sprawl equally helpless , their toboggans upended in clouds of spray . Nasiri desperately tried to avoid them and the mogul and wrenched his craft into a violent skiddingp247turn but lost it and went tumbling down the mountainside to end up a little ahead of the others , gasping for breath . Nitchak Khan sat up and wiped the snow out of his face and beard . " Praise be to God , " he muttered , astonished that no limbs were broken , and he kx ) ked around at the others . They were also picking themselves up , Scot helpless with laughter at Jean-Luc who was also unhurt but still lying on his hack letting out a paroxysm of French invective . Nasiri had ended up almost headfirst into a snowdrift and Scot , still laughing , went to help him . He , too , was just a little battered but no damage . " Hey , you lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . It was Effer Jordon . " What about the bleeding race ? It 's not over yet ! " " Come on , Scot  --  come on , Jean-Luc , for crissake ! " Scot forgot Nasiri and started to run for the winning post fifty yards away ! nit he slipped and fell in the heavy snow , lurched up and slipped again , feet leaden . Jean-Luc reeled up and charged in pursuit , closely followed by Nasiri uid Nitchak Khan . The cheers of the crowd redoubled as the men fought through the snow , falling , scrambling , getting up and falling again , the going very rough , aches forgotten . Scot was still slightly in the lead , now Nitchak Khan , now Jean-Luc , now Nasiri  --  mechanic Fowler Joines , red in the face , urging them on , the villagers as excited . Ten yards to go . The old Khan was three feet in the lead when he tripped and sprawled face forward . Scot took the lead , Nasiri almost beside him , Jean-Luc just inches behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , dragging their boots up out of the heavy snow , then there was a mighty cheer as Nitchak Khan began to scuttle forward on all fours the last few yards , Jean-Luc and Scot made one last desperate headlong dive for the line , and they all collapsed in a heap amid cheers and countercheers . " Scot won . . . " " No , it was Jean-Luc . . . " " No , it was old Nitchak . . . " When he had collected his breath , Jean-Luc said , " As there is no clear opinion and even our revered mullah is not sure , I , Jean-Luc , declare Nitchak Khan the winner by a nostril . " There were cheers and even more as he added , " And as the losers lost so bravely , I award them with another of Tom 's bottles of whisky which I will commandeer to be shared by all expats at sundown ! " Everyone shook hands with everyone . Nitchak Khan agreed to another challenge match next month and , as he honored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold the whisky he had won to Jean-Luc at half its value . Everyone cheered again , then someone shouted a warning.  |p248Northward  , far up in the mountains , a red signal flare was falling into the valley . The silence was sudden . The flare vanished . Then another arced up and outward to fall again : SOS Urgent . " CASEVAC , " Jean-Luc said , squinting into the distance . " Must be Rig Rosa or Rig Bellissima . " " I 'm on my way . " Scot Gavallan hurried off . " I 'll come with you , " Jean-Luc said . " We 'll take a 212 and make it a check ride for you . " In minutes they were airborne . Rig Rosa was one of the rigs they had acquired from the old Guerney contract , Bellissima one of their regulars . All eleven rigs in this area had been developed by an Italian company for IranOil , and though all were radio linked with Zagros Three , the connection was not always solid because of the mountains and scatter effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing through ten thousand feet , snow-locked valleys sparkled in the sunshine , their operational ceiling seventeen thousand , depending on their load . Now Rig Rosa was ahead in a clearing on a small plateau at eleven thousand four hundred seventy . Just a few trailers for housing , and sheds scattered haphazardly around the tall derrick . And a helipad . " Rig Rosa , this is Jean-Luc . Do you read ? " He waited patiently . " Loud and clear , Jean-Luc ! " It was the happy voice of Mimmo Sera , the " company man "  --  the highest rank on the site , an engineer in charge of all operations . " What you got for us , eh ? " " Niente , Mimmo ! We saw a red flare and we 're just checking . " " Madonna , CASEVAC ? It was n't us . " At once Scot broke off his approach , banked , and went on to the new heading , climbing farther into the mountain range . " Bellissima ? " " We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have n't been in contact since the storm came . What 's the latest news ? " " The last we heard was two days ago : the BBC said the Immortals at Doshan Tappeh had put down a rebellion of air force cadets and civilians . We have n't heard from our Tehran HQ or anyone . If we do I 'll radio you . " " Eh , radio ! jean-Luc , we 'll need another dozen loads of six-inch pipe and the usual of cement starting tomorrow . Okay ? " " Bien sari " Jean-Luc was delighted with the extra business and the opportunity to prove they were better than Guerney . " How 's it going ? " " We 've drilled to eight thousand feet and everything looks like another bonanza . I want to run the well next Monday , if possible . Can you order up Schlumberger for me ? " Schlumberger was the worldwide firm that manufac/tured and supplied down-hole tools that sampled and electronically measured , with vast accuracy , oil-bearing capabilities and qualities of the various strata , tools to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits , tools to perforate , by explosion , the steel casings of the hole to allow oil to flow into the pipe  --  along with the experts to work them . Very expensive but totally necessary . " To run a well " was the last job before cementing the steel casing in place and bringing the well on stream . " Wherever they are , Mimmo , we 'll bring them Monday  --  Khomeini will-ing ! " " Mamma mia , tell Nasiri we have to have them . " Reception was fading rapidly . " No problem . I 'll call you on the way back . " Jean-Luc glanced out of the cockpit . They were passing over a ridge , still climbing , the engines beginning to labor . " Merde , I 'm hungry , " he said , and stretched in his seat . " I feel like I 've been massaged with a pneumatic drill  --  but that was a great race ! " " You know , Jean-Luc , you were at the line a second before Nitchak Khan . Easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diplomatique , and very practical . I knew he 'd sell us back our whisky for half price ; if he 'd been declared the loser , it would have cost us a fortune . " Jean-Luc beamed . " But if it had n't been for that mogul , I would not have hesitated  --  I would have won easily . " Scot smiled and said nothing , breathing easily , but conscious of his breathing . Above twelve thousand , according to regulations , pilots should be on oxygen if they were to stay up for more than half an hour . They carried none and never , yet , had any of the pilots felt any discomfort other than a headacheor two , though it took a week or so to get acclimatized to living at seventy-five hundred feet . It was harder for the riggers at Bellissima . Their own stopovers at Bellissima were usually very short . Just lumber up with maximum payload , inside or out , of 4,000 pounds . Pipes , pumps , diesel , winches , generators , chemicals , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-purposename for the liquid that was pumped into the drill hole to remove waste , to keep the bit lubricated , in due course to tame the oil or gas , and without which deep drilling was impossible . Then lumber out , light , or with a full load of men or equipment for repair or replacement . We 're just a jumped-up delivery van , Scot thought , his eyes scanning the skies , instruments , and all around . Yes , but how grand to be flying and not driving . Below , the crags were quite close , the tree line long since passed . They mounted the last ridge . Now they could see the rig . " Bellissima , this is Jean-Luc . Do you read ? "  |p250Rig  Bellissima was the highest of the chain , exactly at twelve thousand four hundred fifty feet above sea level . The base was perched on a ledge just below the crest . The other side of the ledge the mountain fell away seven thousand feet , almost sheer , into a valley ten miles wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth . " Bellissima , this is Jean-Luc . Do you read ? " Again no answer . Jean-Luc switched channels . " Zagros Three , do you read ? " " Loud and clear , Captain , " came the immediate answer of their Iranian base radio op Aliwari . " Excellency Nasiri 's beside me . " " Stand by on this frequency . The CASEVAC 's at Bellissima , but we 've no radio contact . We 're going in to land . " " Roger . Standing by . " As always at Bellissima , Scot was awed at the vastness of the earth 's convulsionthat had caused the valley . And , like all who visited this rig , again he wondered at the enormity of the gamble , labor , and wealth necessary to find the oil field , select the site , erect the rig , then to drill the thousands of feet to make the wells profitable . But they were , immensely so , as was this whole area with its huge oil and gas deposits trapped in limestone cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then the further huge investment and more gambling to connect this field to the pipeline that straddled the Zagros Mountains , joining the refineries at Isfahanin the center of Iran to those at Abadan on the Gulf  --  another extraordinaryengineering feat of the old Anglo-Iranian Oil Company , now nationalizedand renamed IranOil . " Stolen , Scot , laddie , stolen 's the correct word , " his father had told him many times . Scot Gavallan smiled to himself , thinking about his father , feeling a warm glow . I 'm bloody lucky to have him , he thought . I still miss Mother but I 'm glad she died . Terrible for a lovely , active woman to become a helpless , chairridden , palsied shell , still with her mind intact even at the end , the best mother a guy could have . Rotten luck , her death , particularly for Dad . But I 'm glad he remarried , Maureen 's super , and Dad 's super and I 've a smashing life and the future 's rosy  --  plenty of flying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get married : how about Tess ? His heart picked up a beat . Bloody nuisance Linbar 's her uncle and she his favorite niece , but bloody lucky I do n't have anything to do with him , she 's only eighteen so there 's plenty of time . . . " Which way will you land , mon vieux ? " came through his earphones . " From the west , " he said , collecting himself . " Good . " Jean-Luc was peering ahead . No sign of life . The site was heavilyp251covered with snow , almost buried . Only the helipad was cleared . Threads of smoke came up from the trailer huts . " Ah ! There ! " They saw the tiny figure of a man , bundled up , standing near the helipad and waving his arms . " Who is it ? " " I think it 's Pietro . " Scot was concentrating on the landing . At this height and because of the position on the ledge there were sudden gusts , turbulences , and whirlwinds within them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abyss , the eddies rocking them , then corrected beautifully as he swooped over the land and touched down . " Good . " Jean-Luc turned his attention back to the bundled-up man he now recognized as Pietro Fieri , one of the " tool pushers , " next in importance to the company man . They saw him motion with his hand across his throat , the sign to cut engines , indicating the CASEVAC was not an immediate takeoff situation . Jean-Luc beckoned the man to his side window and opened it . " What 's up , Pietro ? " he shouted over the engines . " Guineppa is sick , " Pietro shouted back  --  Mario Guineppa was the companyman  --  and thumped the left side of his chest . " We think it may be his heart . And that 's not all . Look there ! " He pointed aloft . Jean-Luc and Scot craned to see better but could not see what was agitating him . Jean-Luc unbuckled and got out . The cold hit him and he winced , his eyes watering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses helping only a little . Then he saw the problem , and his stomach twisted nastily . A few hundred feet above and almost directly over the camp , just under the crest , was an enormous overhang of snow and ice . " Madonna ! " " If that goes , it 'll avalanche the whole mountainside and maybe take us and everything into the valley along with it ! " Pietro 's face was bluish in the cold . He was thickset and very strong with a dark grizzled beard , his eyes brown and keen but squinting now against the wind . " Guineppa wants to confer with you . Come to his trailer , eh ? " " And that ? " jean-Luc jerked a thumb upward . " If it goes , it goes , " Pietro said with a laugh , his teeth white against the darkness of his oil-stained parka . " Come on ! " He ducked away from the rotors and trudged away . " Come on ! " Uneasily Jean-Luc gauged the overhang . It could be there for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was peerless , but little warmth came from the afternoon sun . " Stay here , Scot , keep her idling , " he called out , then followed Pietro awkwardly , the snow very deep . Mario Guineppa 's two-room trailer was warm and untidy , charts on the walls , oil-stained clothes , heavy gloves , and hard hats on pegs with an oilman 's paraphernalia scattered about the office/living room . He was in thep252bedroom , lying on his bed fully dressed but for his boots , a big tall man of forty-five with an imposing nose , normally ruddy and weathered , but now pallid , a curious bluish tinge to his lips . The tool pusher from the other shift , Enrico Banastasio , was with him  --  a small , dark man with dark eyes and thin face . " Ah , Jean-Luc ! Good to see you , " Guineppa said wearily . " And you , mon ami . " Very concerned , Jean-Luc unzipped his flying jacket and sat beside the bed . Guineppa had been in charge of Bellissima for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months on site , two off  --  and had brought in three major producing wells here with space to drill another four . " It 's the hospital in Shiraz for you . " " That 's not important , first there 's the overhang . Jean-Luc , I wa  --  " " We evacuate and leave that stronzo to the Hands of God , " Banastasio said . " Mamma mia , Enrico , " Guineppa said irritably , " I tell you again I think we can give God a hand  --  with Jean-Luc 's help . Pietro agrees . Eh , Pietro ? " " Yes , " Pietro said from the doorway , a toothpick in his mouth . " Jean-Luc , I was brought up in Aosta in the Italian Alps so I know mountains and avalanches and I th  --  " " Si , e sei pazzo . " Yes , and you 're crazy , Banastasio said curtly . " Nei tuo culo . " In your ass . Pietro casually made an obscene gesture . " With your help jean-Luc , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to do ? " Jean-Luc asked . Guineppa said , " Take Pietro and fly up over the crest to a place he 'll show you on the north face . He 'll drop a stick of dynamite into the snow from there and that 'll avalanche the danger away from us . " Pietro beamed . " Just like that and the overhang will vanish . " Banastasio said even more angrily , his English American-accented , " Forcrissake , I tell you again it 's too goddamn risky . We should evacuate firstthen if you must , try your dynamite . " Guineppa 's face screwed up as a spasm of pain went through him . One hand went to his chest . " If we evacuate we have to close everything down an , " So ? So we close down . So what ? If you do n't care about your own life , think of the rest of us . I say we evacuate pronto . Then dynamite . Jean-Luc , is n't it safer ? " " Of course it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitate the older man . " Pietro , you say you know avalanches . How long will that hold ? " " My nose says it will go soon . Very soon . There are cracks below . Perhapsp253tomorrow , even tonight . I know where to blow her  --  and be very safe . " Pietro looked at Banastasio . " I can do it whatever this stronzo thinks . " Banastasio got up . " Jean-Luc , me and my shift 're evacuating . Pronto . Whatever is decided . " He left . Guineppa shifted in his cot . " Jean-Luc , take Pietro aloft . Now . " " First , we 'll evacuate everyone to Rig Rosa , you first , " Jean-Luc said crisply , " then dynamite . If it works you 're back in business , if not there 's enough temporary space at Rig Rosa for you . " " Not first , last . . . there 's no need to evacuate . " Jean-Luc hardly heard him . He was estimating numbers of men to move . Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mudman , who monitored the mud and decided on its chemical constituents and weight , driller , who looked after the drilling , motorman , responsible for all winches , pumps , and so on , and four roustabouts to attach or unhook the pipes and drills . " You 've seven Iranian cooks and laborers ? " " Yes . But I tell you it 's not necessary to evacuate , " Guineppa said exhaustedly . " Safer , mon vieux . " Jean-Luc turned to Pietro . " Tell everyone to travel light and be fast . " Pietro glanced down at Guineppa . " Yes or no ? " Disgustedly , Guineppa nodded , the effort tiring him . " Ask for a volunteer crew to stay . If no one will , Mother of God , close down . " Pietro was clearly disappointed . Still picking his teeth , he went out . Guineppa shifted in the cot again , trying to get more comfortable , and began to curse . He seemed more frail than before . Jean-Luc said quietly , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and clever but that porco misero , Banastasio , he 's fart up to his nostrils , always trouble , and it was his fault the radio was smashed , I know it ! " " What ? " " It was smashed on his shift . Now we need a new one , do you have a spare ? " " No , but I 'll see if I can get you one . Is it reparable ? Perhaps one of our mechanics c  --  " " Banastasio said he slipped and fell on it , but I heard he hit it with a hammer when it would n't work . . . . Mamma mia ! " Guineppa winced and clutched his chest and began to curse again . " How long have you been having pains ? " " Since two days . Today has been the worst . That stronzo Banastasio ! " Guineppa muttered . " But what can you expect , it runs in his family . Eh ! Hisp254family are half-American , no ? I heard the American side has mafioso connec-tions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half listening to the tirade . He knew that they hated each other  --  Guineppa , the Portuguese-Roman patrician , and Banastasio , Sicilian-American peasant . But that 's not so surprising , he thought , locked up here , twelve hours on , twelve off , day after day , month after month , however good the pay . Ah , the pay ! How I could use their pay ! Why even the lowest roustabout gets as much in one week as I get in a month  --  a miserable 1,200 pounds sterling monthly for me , a senior captain and training captain , with fortyeighthundred hours ! Even with the miserly 500 pounds monthly overseas allowance , that 's not enough for the kids , school fees , my wife , the mortgage and filthy taxes . . . let alone the best food and wine and my darling Sayada . Ah , Sayada , how I 've missed you ! But for Lochart . . . Piece of shit ! Tom Lochart could have let me go with him and I could be in Tehran in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And money . Money ! May the balls of all taxmen shrivel into dust and their cocks vanish ! I 've barely enough as it is and if Iran goes down the sewer , what then ? I 'll bet S-G wo n't survive . That 's their bad luck  --  there 'll always be chopper work for a pilot as excellent as I am somewhere in the world . He saw Guineppa watching him . " Yes , mon vieux ? " " 1 ' 11 go with the last load . " . " Better to go first , there 's a medic at Rosa . " " I 'm fine  --  honestly . " Then Jean-Luc heard his name being called and put on his parka . " Can I do anything for you ? " The man smiled wearily . " Just take Pietro aloft with the dynamite . " " I 'll do that , but last , with any luck , before dusk . Do n't worry . " Outside the cold hit him again . Pietro was waiting for him . Men werealready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags ofvarious sizes . Banastasio went past leading a big German shepherd . " The man said to travel light , " Pietro told him . " I am , " Banastasio said equally sourly . " I 've my papers , my dog , and my shift . The rest 's replaceable , on the goddamn company . " Then to Jean-Luc , " You 've a full load , Jean-Luc , let 's get with it . " Jean-Luc checked the men aboard , and the dog , then called Nasiri on the radio and told him what they were going to do . " Okay , Scot , off you go . You take her , " he said and got out and saw Scot 's eyes widen . " You mean by myself ? "  | " Why not , mon brave . You 've the hours . This 's your third check ride . You 've got to start sometime . Off you go . " He watched Scot lift off . In barely five seconds the chopper was over the abyss with a clear seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first solo takeoff from Bellissima would be , envying the young man the thrill . Young Scot 's worth it , he thought , watching him critically . " Jean-Luc ! " He took his eyes off the distant chopper and glanced around , wondering suddenly what was so different . Then he realized it was the silence , so vast that it almost seemed to deafen him . For a moment he felt weirdly unbalanced , even a little sick , then the whine of the wind picked up and he became whole again . " Jean-Luc ! Over here ! " Pietro was in a shadow with a group of men on the other side of the camp , beckoning him . Laboriously , he picked his way over to them . They were strangely silent . " Look there , " Pietro said nervously and pointed aloft . " Just under the overhang . There ! Twenty , thirty feet below . You see the cracks ? " Jean-Luc saw them . His testicles heaved . They were no longer cracks in the ice but fissures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wholemass seemed to shift a fraction . A small chunk of ice and snow fell away . It gathered speed and substance and thundered down the steep slope . They were shock-still . The avalanche , now tons of snow and ice , came to rest barely fifty yards away from them . One of the men broke the silence . " Let 's hope the chopper does n't come barreling back like a kamikaze  --  that could be the detonator , amico . Even alittle noise could trigger that whole stronzo apart . "  |p256IN  THE SKIES NEAR QAZVIN : 3:17 P.M. From the moment CharliePettikin had left Tabriz almost two hours ago with Rakoczy  --  the man he knew as Smith  --  he had flown the 206 as straight and level as possible , hopingto lull the KGB man to sleep , or at least off guard . For the same reason he had avoided conversation by slipping his headset onto his neck . At length Rakoczy had given up , just watched the terrain below . But he stayed alert with his gun across his lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , who he was , what he was , what band of revolutionaries he belonged to  --  fedayeen , mujhadin , or Khomeini supporter  --  or if he was loyal , gendarmerie , army , or SAVAK , and if so why it was so important to get to Tehran . It had never occurred to Pettikin that the man was Russian not Iranian . At Bandar-e Pahlavi where refueling had been laboriously slow , he had done nothing to break the monotony , just paid over his last remaining U.S.p257dollars and watched while the tanks were filled , then signed the official IranOilchit . Rakoczy had tried to chat with the ref ueler but the man was hostile , clearly frightened of being seen refueling this foreign helicopter , and even more frightened of the machine gun that was on the front seat . All the time they were on the ground Pettikin had gauged the odds of trying to grab the gun . There was never a chance . It was Czech . In Korea they had been plentiful . And Vietnam . My God , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had taken off from Bandar-e Pahlavi and was now heading south at a thousand feet , following the Qazvin road . East he could see the beach where he had set down Captain Ross and his two paratroopers . Again he wondered how they had known he was making a flight to Tabriz and what their mission had been . Hope to God they make it  --  whatever they had to make . Had to be urgent and important . Hope I see Ross again , I 'd like that . . . " Why do you smile , Captain ? " The voice came through his earphones . Automatically on takeoff this time he had put them on . He looked across at Rakoczy and shrugged , then went back to monitoring his instruments and the ground below . Over Qazvin he banked southeast following the Tehran road , once more retreating into himself . Be patient , he told himself , then saw Rakoczy tense and put his face closer to the window , looking downward . " Bank left . . . a little left , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pettikin put the chopper into a gentle bank  --  Rakoczy on the low side . " No , more ! Make a 180 . " " What is it ? " Pettikin asked . He steepened the bank , suddenly aware the man had forgotten the machine gun in his lap . His heart picked up a beat . " There , below on the road . That truck . " Pettikin paid no attention to the ground below . He kept his eyes on the gun , gauging the distance carefully , his heart racing . " Where ? I ca n't see anything . . . " He steepened the bank even more to come around quickly onto the new heading . " What truck ? You mean . .. " His left hand darted out and grabbed the gun by the barrel and awkwardly jerked it through the sliding window into the cabin behind them . At the same time his right hand on the stick went harder left then quickly right and left-right again , rocking the chopper viciously . Rakoczy was taken completely unaware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At once Pettikin clenched his left fist and inexpertly slashed at the man 's jaw to put him unconscious . But Rakoczy , karate-trained , his reflexes good , managed to stop the blow with his forearm . Groggily he held on to Pettikin 's wrist , gaining strength every second as the two men fought for supremacy ,  |p258the  chopper dangerously heeled over , Rakoczy still on the downside . They grappled with each other , cursing , seat belts inhibiting them . Both became more frenzied , Rakoczy with two hands free beginning to dominate . Abruptly Pettikin gripped the stick with his knees , took his right hand off it , and smashed again at Rakoczy 's face . The blow was not quite true but the strength of it shifted him off balance , destroyed the grip of his knees shoving the stick left , and overrode the delicate balance of his feet on the rudder pedals . At once the chopper reeled onto its side , lost all lift  --  no chopper can fly itself even for a second  --  the centrifugal force further throwing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved down . The chopper fell out of the sky , out of control . In panic , Pettikin abandoned the fight . Blindly he struggled to regain control , engines screaming and instruments gone mad . Hands and feet and training against panic , overcorrecting , then overcorrecting again . They dropped nine hundred feet before he got her straight and level , his heart unbearable , the snow-covered ground fifty feet below . His hands were trembling . It was difficult to breathe . Then he felt somethinghard shoved in his side and heard Rakoczy cursing . Dully he realized the language was not Iranian but did not recognize it . He looked across at him and saw the face twisted with anger and the gray metal of the automatic and cursed himself for not thinking of that . Angrily he tried to shove the gun away but Rakoczy stuck it hard into the side of his neck . " Stop or I 'll blow your head off , you matyeryebyets ! " At once Pettikin put the plane into a violent bank , but the gun pressed harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and the gun cock . " Your last chance ! " The ground was very near , rushing past sickeningly . Pettikin knew he could not shake him off . " All right  --  all right , " he said , conceding , and straightened her and began to climb . The pressure from the gun increased and with it , the pain . " You 're hurting me for God 's sake and shoving me off balance ! How can I fly if y  --  " Rakoczy just jabbed the gun harder , shouting at him , cursing him , jamminghis head against the doorframe . " For Christ 's sake ! " Pettikin shouted back in desperation , trying to adjust his headset that had been torn off in the struggle . " How the hell can I fly with your gun in my neck ? " The pressure eased off a fraction and he righted the plane . " Who the hell are you , anyway ? " " Smith ! " Rakoczy was equally unnerved . A split second later , he thought , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dung . " You thinkp259you deal with a matyeryebyets amateur ? " Before he could stop himself his reflexes took his hand and backhanded Pettikin across the mouth . Pettikin was rocked by the blow , and the chopper twisted but came back into control . He felt the burn spreading over his face . " You do that again and I 'll put her on her back , " he said with a great finality . " I agree , " Rakoczy said at once . " I apologize for . . . for that . . . for that stupidity , Captain . " Carefully he eased back against his door but kept the gun cocked and pointed . " Yes , there was no need . I 'm sorry . " Pettikin stared at him blankly . " You 're sorry ? " " Yes . Please excuse me . It was unnecessary . I am not a barbarian . " Rakoczy gathered himself . " If you give me your word you 'll stop trying to attack me , I 'll put my gun away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . " All right , " he said . " If you tell me who you are and what you are . " " Your word ? " " Yes . " " Very well , I accept your word , Captain . " Rakoczy put the safety on and the gun in his far pocket . " My name is Ali bin Hassan Karakose and I 'm a Kurd . My home  --  my village  --  is on the slopes of Mount Ararat on the Iranian  --  Sovietborder . Through the Blessings of God I 'm a Freedom Fighter against the Shah , and anyone else who wishes to enslave us . Does that satisfy you ? " " Yes  --  yes it does . Then if y  --  " " Please , later . First go there  --  quickly . " Rakoczy pointed below . " Level off and go closer . " They were at eight hundred feet to the right of the Qazvin  --  Tehran road . A village straddled the road a mile back and he could see the smoke whirled away by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the road . " At first Pettikin could not see what the man pointed at  --  his mind jumbled with questions about the Kurds and their historic centuries of wars against the Persian Shahs . Then he saw the collection of cars and trucks pulled up to one side , and men surrounding a modern truck with a blue cross on a rectangularwhite background on the roof , other traffic grinding past slowly . " You mean there ? You want to go over those trucks and cars ? " he asked , his face still smarting and his neck aching . " The bunch of trucks near the one with the blue cross on its roof ? " " Yes . " Obediently Pettikin went into a descending bank . " What 's so importantp260about them , eh ? " he asked , then glanced up . He saw the man staring at him suspiciously . " What ? What the hell 's the matter now ? " " You really do n't know what a blue cross on a white background signifies ? " " No . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes on the truck that was much closer now , close enough to see it was a red Range Rover , an angry crowd surrounding it , one of the men smashing at the back windows with the butt of a rifle . " It 's the flag of Finland " came through his earphones and " Erikki " leaped into Pettikin 's mind . " Erikki had a Range Rover , " he burst out and saw the rifle butt shatter the window . " You think that 's Erikki ? " " Yes . . . yes it 's possible . " At once he went faster and lower , his pain forgotten , his excitement overridingall the sudden questions of how and why this Freedom Fighter knew Erikki . Now they could see the crowd turning toward them and people scattering . His pass was very fast and very low but he did not see Erikki . " You see him ? " " No . I could n't see inside the cab . " " Nor could I , " Pettikin said anxiously , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashing the windows . You see them ? " " Yes . They must be fedayeen . One of them fired at us . If you . . . " Rakoczy stopped , hanging on tightly as the chopper skidded into a 180-degree turn , twenty feet off the ground , and hurtled back again . This time the crowd of men and the few women fled , falling over one another . Traffic in both directions tried to speed away or shuddered to a halt , one overloaded truck skidding into another . Several cars and trucks turned off the road and one almost overturned in the joub . Just abreast of the Range Rover , Pettikin swung into a sliding 90-degree turn to face it  --  snow boiling into a cloud  --  for just enough time to recognize Erikki , then into another 90 degrees to barrel away into the sky . " It 's him all right . Did you see the bullet holes in the windscreen ? " he asked , shocked . " Reach in the back for the machine gun . I 'll steady her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to keep them off balance . " At once Rakoczy unbuckled his seat belt , reached back through the small intercommunicating window but could not get the gun that lay on the floor . With great difficulty he twisted out of his seat and clambered headfirst , half through the window , groping for it , and Pettikin knew the man was at his mercy . So easy to open the door now and shove him out . So easy . But impossible . " Come on ! " he shouted and helped pull him back into the seat . " Put your belt on ! " Rakoczy obeyed , trying to catch his breath , blessing his luck that Pettikinp261was a friend of the Finn , knowing that if their positions had been reversed he would not have hesitated to open the door . " I 'm ready , " he said , cocking the gun , appalled at Pettikin 's stupidity . The British are so stupid the mothereatingbastards deserve to lose . " Wh  --  " " Here we go ! " Pettikin spun the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed men were still near the truck , guns pointing at them . " I 'll soften them up and when I say fire ' put a burst over their heads ! " The Range Rover rushed up at them , hesitated , then swirled away drunkenly  --  notrees nearby  --  hesitated again and came at them as the chopper danced around it . Pettikin flared to a sudden stop twenty yards away , ten feet off the ground . " Fire , " he ordered . At once Rakoczy let off a burst through the open window , aiming not over heads but at a group of men and women ducked down behind the back end of Erikki 's truck , out of Pettikin 's line of sight , killing or wounding some of them . Everyone nearby fled panic-stricken  --  screams of the wounded mingling with the howl of the jets . Drivers and passengers jumped out of cars and trucks scrambling away in the snowdrifts as best they could . Another burst and more panic , now everyone rushing in retreat , all traffic snarled . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rakoczy sprayed them and those nearby . " Make a 360 ! " he shouted . Immediately the helicopter pirouetted but no one was near . Pettikin saw four bodies in the snow . " I said over their heads , for God 's sake , " he began , but at that moment the door of the Range Rover swung open and Erikki jumped out , his knife in one hand . For a moment he was alone , then a chador-clad woman was beside him . At once Pettikin set the chopper down on the snow but kept her almost airborne . " Come on , " he shouted , beckoningthem . They began to run , Erikki half carrying Azadeh whom Pettikin did not yet recognize . Beside him Rakoczy unlocked his side door and leaped out , opened the back door , and whirled on guard . Another short burst toward the traffic . Erikki stopped , appalled to see Rakoczy . " Hurry ! " Pettikin shouted , not understanding the reason for Erikki 's hesitation . " Erikki , come on ! " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered , then shouted , " Come on , Erikki ! " " Quick , I 've not much ammunition left ! " Rakoczy shouted in Russian . Erikki whirled Azadeh up into his arms and ran forward . A few bullets hummed past . At the side of the helicopter Rakoczy helped bundle Azadeh into the back , suddenly shoved Erikki aside with the barrel of the gun . " Drop your knife and get in the front seat ! " he ordered in Russian . " At once . "  |p262Half  paralyzed with shock , Pettikin watched Erikki hesitate , his face mottledwith rage . Rakoczy said harshly , " By God , there 's more than enough ammunition for her , you , and this motherfucking pilot . Get in ! " Somewhere in the traffic a machine gun started to fire . Erikki dropped his knife in the snow , eased his great height into the front seat , Rakoczy slid beside Azadeh , and Pettikin took off and sped away , weaving over the ground like a panicked grouse , then climbed into the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell 's going on ? " Erikki did not answer . He craned around to make sure Azadeh was all right . She had her eyes closed and was slumped against the side , panting , trying to get her breath . He saw that Rakoczy had locked her seat belt , but when Erikki reached back to touch her the Soviet motioned him to stop with the gun . " She will be all right , I promise you . " He continued speaking in Russian , " providing you behave as your friend has been taught to behave . " He keptli his eyes on him as he reached into his small bag and brought out a freshmagazine . " Just so you know . Now face forward , please . " Trying to contain his fury , Erikki did as he was told . He put on the headset . There was no way they could be overheard by Rakoczy  --  there was no intercom in the back  --  and it felt strange for both of them to be so free and yet so imprisoned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " he said into the mouth mike , his voice heavy . " No one did , " Pettikin said . " What the hell 's with that bastard ? I went to Tabriz to pick up you and Azadeh , got kidnapped by the sonofabitch in the back , and then he hijacked me to Tehran . It was just luck for Christ 's sake  --  what the hell happened to you ? " " We ran out of fuel . " Erikki told him briefly what had happened . " When the engine stopped , I knew I was finished . Everyone seems to have gone mad . One moment it was all right , then we were surrounded again , just like at the roadblock . I locked all the doors but it was only a matter of time . . . " Again he craned around . Azadeh had her eyes open and had pulled the chador off her face . She smiled at him wearily , reached forward to touch him but Rakoczy stopped her . " Please excuse me , Highness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . You will be all right . " He repeated it in Russian , adding to Erikki , " I have some water with me . Would you like me to give it to your wife ? " Erikki nodded . " Yes . Please . " He watched while she sipped gratefully . " Thank you . " " Do you want some ? "  | " No , thank you , " he said politely even though he was parched , not wishing any favors for himself . He smiled at her encouragingly . " Azadeh , like manna from heaven , eh ? Charlie like an angel ! " " Yes . . . yes . It was the Will of God . I 'm fine , fine now , Erikki , praise be to God . Thank Charlie for me . . . " He hid his concern . The second mob had petrified her . And him , and he had sworn that if he ever got out of this mess alive , never again would he travel without a gun and , preferably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned back again . " Matyeryebyets , " he muttered , automatically checking the instruments . " That bugger 's a lunatic  --  no need to kill anyone , I told him to fire over their heads . " Pettikin dropped his voice slightly , uneasy at talking so openly even though there was no way Rakoczy could hear . " The bastard damn near killed me a couple of times . How do you know him , Erikki ? Were you or Azadeh mixed up with the Kurds ? " Erikki stared at him . " Kurds ? You mean the matyeryebyets back there ? " " Yes , him of course  --  Ali bin Hassan Karakose . He comes from Mount Ararat . He 's a Kurd Freedom Fighter . " " He 's not a Kurd but a turd , Soviet and KGB ! " " Christ Almighty ! You 're sure ? " Pettikin was openly shocked . " Oh , yes . He claims he 's Muslim but I bet that 's a lie too . Rakoczy ' he called himself to me , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they tell us , the enemy , anything ? " " But he swore it was the truth and I gave him my word . " Angrily Pettikin told him about the fight and the bargain he had made . " You 're the fool , Charlie , not him have n't you read Lenin ? Stalin ? Marx ? He 's only doing what all KGB and committed Communists do : use anything and everything to forward the sacred ' Cause  --  absolute world power for the USSR Communist party  --  and get us to hang ourselves to save them the trouble . My God , I could use a vodka ! " " A double brandy 'd be better . " " Both together would be even better . " Erikki studied the ground below . They were cruising easily , the engines sounding good and plenty of fuel . His eyes searched the horizon for Tehran . " Not long now . Has he said where to land yet ? " " No . " " Perhaps we 'll get a chance then . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roadblock . What happened there ? " Erikki 's face hardened . " We got stopped . Leftists . Had to make a run forp264it . We 've no papers left , Azadeh and I. Nothing . A fat bastard at the roadblockkept everything and there was n't time to get them back . " A tremor went through him . " I 've never been so scared , Charlie . Never . I was helpless in that mob and almost shitting with fear because I could n't protect her . That stinking fat bastard took everything , passport , ID , flying licenses , every-thing . " " Mac 'll get you more , your embassy 'll give you passports . " " I 'm not worried about me . What about Azadeh ? " " She 'll get a Finnish passport too . Like Sharazad 'll get a Canadian one  --  no need to worry . " " She 's still in Tehran , is n't she ? " " Sure . Tom should be there too . He was due in from Zagros yesterday with mails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing . I still call Englandhome even with Claire gone , everything gone . " He 's just back offleave . " " That 's what I 'd like to do , go on leave . I , m overdue . Perhaps Mac can send a replacement . " Erikki punched Pettikin lightly . " Tomorrow can take care of tomorrow , eh ? Hey , Charlie , that was a great piece of flying . When I first saw you , I thought I was dreaming or already dead . You saw my Finnish flag ? " " No , that was Ali  --  what did you call him ? Rekowsky ? " " Rakoczy . " " Rakoczy recognized it . If he had n't I would n't have been any the wiser . Sorry . " Pettikin glanced across . " What 's he want with you ? " I do n't know but whatever it is , it 's for Soviet purposes . " Erikki cursed for a moment . " So we owe our lives to him too ? " After a moment Pettikin said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone . " He glanced around . Rakoczy was totally alert , Azadeh dozing , shadows over her lovely face . He nodded briefly , then turned back . " Azadeh seems okay . " " No , Charlie , no , she 's not , " Erikki said , an ache inside him . " Today was terrible for her . She said she 'd never been that close to villagers ever . . . I mean surrounded , bottled in . Today they got under her guard . Now she 's seen the real face of Iran , the reality of her people  --  that and the forcing of the chador . " Again a shiver went through him . " That was a rape  --  they raped her soul . Now I think everything will be different for her , for us . I think she 'll have to choose : family or me , Iran or exile . They do n't want us here . It 's time for us to leave , Charlie . All of us . " " No , you 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll still need oil so they 'll still need choppers . We 're good for a few more years , good years . With the Guerney contracts and all th  --  " Pettikin stopped ,  |p265feeling  a tap on his shoulder , and he glanced around . Azadeh was awake now . He could not hear what Rakoczy said so he slipped one earphone off . " What ? " " Do n't use the radio , Captain , and be prepared to land on the outskirts where I 'll tell you . " " I . . . I 'll have to get clearance . " " Do n't be a fool ! Clearance from whom ? Everyone 's too busy down there . Tehran Airport 's under siege  --  so is Doshan Tappeh and so 's Galeg Morghi . Take my advice and make your landfall the small airport of Rudrama after you 've dropped me . " " I have to report in . The military insist . " Rakoczy laughed sardonically . " Military ? And what would you report ? That you landed illegally near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up two foreigners fleeing  --  fleeing from whom ? From the People ! " Grimly Pettikin turned back to make the call but Rakoczy leaned forward and shook him roughly . " Wake up ! The military does n't exist anymore . The generals have conceded victory to Khomeini ! The military does n't exist anymore  --  they'vegiven in ! " They all stared at him blankly . The chopper lurched . Hastily Pettikin corrected . " What 're you talking about ? " " Late last night the generals ordered all troops back to their barracks . All services  --  all men . They 've left the field to Khomeini and his revolution . Now there 's no army , no police , no gendarmes between Khomeini and total power  --  the People have conquered ! " " That 's not possible , " Pettikin said . " No , " Azadeh said , frightened . " My father would have known . " " Ah , Abdollah the Great ? " Rakoczy said with a sneer . " He 'll know by now  --  if he 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's . . . it 's possible , Azadeh , " Erikki said , shocked . " That 'd explain why we saw no police or troops  --  why the mob was so hostile ! " " The generals 'd never do that , " she said shakily , then turned on Rakoczy . " It would be suicide , for them and thousands . Tell the truth , by Allah ! " Rakoczy 's face mirrored his glee , delighted to twist words and sow dissensionto unsettle them . " Now Iran 's in the hands of Khomeini , his mullahs , and his Revolutionary Guards . " " It 's a lie . " Pettikin said , " If that 's true Bakhtiar 's finished . He 'll nev  --  " " That weak fool never even began ! " Rakoczy started laughing . " Ayatollahp266Khomeini has frightened the balls off the generals and now he 'll cut their throats for good measure ! " " Then the war 's over . " " Ah , the war , " Rakoczy said darkly . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , baiting him . " And if what you say is true , it 's all over for you too  --  all the Tudeh and all Marxists . Khomeini will slaughter you all . " " Oh , no , Captain . The Ayatollah was the sword to destroy the Shah , but the People wielded the sword . " " He and his mullahs and the People will destroy you he 's as anti-Communistas he is anti-American . " " Better you wait and see and not further delude yourselves , eh ? Khomeini 's a practical man and exults in power , whatever he says now . " Pettikin saw Azadeh whiten and he felt an equal chill . " And the Kurds ? " he asked roughly , " What about them ? " Rakoczy leaned forward , his smile strange . " I am a Kurd whatever the Finn told you about Soviet and KGB . Can he prove what he says ? Of course not . As to the Kurds , Khomeini will try to stamp us out  --  if he 's allowed to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgeoisie , hi landowners , moneylenders , Shah supporters , and , " he added with a sneer , " and any and all people who will not accept his interpretation of the Koran  --  and he 'll spill rivers of blood in the Name of his Allah , his , not the real One God  --  if the bastard 's allowed to . " He glanced out of the window below , checking his bearings , then added even more sardonically , " This heretic Sword of God has served his purpose and now he 's going to be turned into a plowshare  --  and buried ! " " You mean murdered ? " Erikki said . " Buried "  --  again the laugh  --  " at the whim of the People . " Azadeh came to life and tried to claw his face , cursing him . He caught her easily and held her while she struggled . Erikki watched , gray-faced . There was nothing he could do . For the moment . " Stop it ! " Rakoczy said harshly . " You of all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdollah Khan and all the Gorgons and you with them if he wins . " He shoved her away . " Behave , or I shall have to hurt you . It 's true , you of all people should want him dead . " He cocked the machine gun . " Turn around , both of you . " They obeyed , hating the man and the gun . Ahead , the outskirts of Tehran were about ten miles away . They were paralleling the road and railway , the Elburz Mountains to their left , approaching the city from the west . Overheadthe sky was overcast , the clouds heavy , and no sun showed through . " Captain , you see the stream where the railway crosses it ? The bridge ? "  | " Yes , I can see that , " Pettikin said , trying to make a plan to overcome him , as Erikki was also planning  --  wondering if he could whirl and grab him but he was on the wrong side . " Land half a mile south , behind that outcrop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a secondary road that headed for Tehran . A little traffic . " Yes . And then ? " " And then you 're dismissed . For the moment . " Rakoczy laughed and nudged the back of Pettikin 's neck with the barrel of the gun . " With my thanks . But do n't turn around anymore . Stay facing ahead , both of you , and keep your seat belts locked and know that I 'm watching you both very closely . When you land , land firmly and cleanly and when I 'm clear , take off . But do n't turn around or I may become frightened . Frightened men pull triggers . Understand ? " " Yes . " Pettikin studied the landing site . He adjusted his headset . " It look all right to you , Erikki ? " " Yes . Watch the snow dunes . " Erikki tried to keep the nervousness out of his voice . " We should have a plan . " " I think he 's . . . he 's too clever , Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I only need one . " The landing was clean and simple . Snow , whipped up by the idling blades , billowed alongside the windows . " Do n't turn around ! " Both men 's nerves were jagged . They heard the door open and felt the cold air . Then Azadeh screamed , " Erikkiiii ! " In spite of the order both craned around . Rakoczy was already out , draggingAzadeh after him , kicking and struggling and trying to hang on to the door , but he overpowered her easily . The gun was slung over his shoulder . Instantly Erikki jerked his door open and darted out , slid under the fuselage , and charged . But he was too late . A short burst at his feet stopped him . Ten yards away , clear of the rotors , Rakoczy had the gun leveled at them with one hand , the other firm in the neck of her chador . For a moment she was equally still , then she redoubled her efforts , shouting and screaming , flailing at him , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands , shoved her violently at Erikki , breaking the charge and bringing Erikki down with her . At the same moment he leaped backward , turned , and raced away , whirled again , the gun ready , his finger tightening on the trigger . But there was no need to pull it , the Finn and the woman were still on their knees , half stunned . Beyond them the pilotp268was still in his seat . Then he saw Erikki come to his senses , and shove her behind him protectively , readying another charge . " Stop ! " he ordered , " or this time I will kill you all . STOP ! " He put a warning burst into the snow . " Get back in the plane  --  both of you ! " Now totally alert , Erikki watched him suspiciously . " Go on  --  you 're free . Go ! " Desperately afraid , Azadeh scrambled into the backseat . Erikki retreated slowly , his body shielding her . Rakoczy kept the gun unwavering . He saw the Finn sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against skid . At once the engines picked up speed . The chopper eased a foot off the ground , slowly swung around to face him , the back door closing . His heart pounded even more . Now , he thought , do you all die or do we live to fight another day ? The moment seemed to him to last forever . The chopper backed away , foot by foot , still so tempting a target . His finger tightened slightly . But he did not squeeze the further fraction . A few more yards then she twisted , hurried away through the snowfields , and went into the sky . Good , he thought , tiredness almost overcoming him . It would have been better to have been able to keep the woman as a hostage , but never mind . We can grab old Abdollah Khan 's daughter tomorrow , or the day after . She can wait and so can Yokkonen . Meanwhile there 's a country to possess , generalsand mullahs and ayatollahs to kill . . . and other enemies.  |p269AT  TEHRAN AIRPORT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed the barbed-wire security fence , heading for the gate that led to the freight area . The road was snow banked , slippery , and unplowed . It was just below freezing , the sky heavy and dull , night not more than an hour away . Again he looked at his watch . Not much time , he thought , still seething over the closure of his office last night by the komiteh . Early this morning he had tried to sneak back into the building , but it was still guarded and all of his entreaties to be allowed to check the telex had proved fruitless . " Damned people ! " Genny had said when he had stomped back into their apartment . " There must be something we can do . What about George Talbot ? Could he help ? " " I doubt it , but it 's worth a try  --  if Valik was . . . " McIver stopped . " Tom would have refueled by now and be almost there  --  wherever there is. "  | " Let 's hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best . Did you see any shops open ? " " None , Gen. It 's canned soup for lunch and a bottle of beer . " " Sorry , we 're out of beer . " He had tried to call Kowiss and the other bases on his HF but could get no answer from them . Neither could he tune in to the BBC or AFN . He had listened briefly to the inevitable anti-American tirade from Radio Free Iran in Tbilisi and had turned it off in disgust . The phone was dead . He had tried to read , but he could not , his mind beset with worries about Lochart , Pettikin , Starke , and all the others , hating being cut off from his office and telex and , for the moment , out of control . Never happened before , never . Damn the Shah for leaving and letting everything fall apart . Used to be wonderful . Any problem and out to the airport , get on a shuttle to Isfahan , Tabriz , Abadan , Hormuz , Al Shargaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , wherever you felt like it . Sometimes Genny coming along for the ride -- picnic lunches and ice-cold beer . " Sod everything ! " Just after lunch the HF had crackled into life . It was Freddy Ayre at Kowiss relaying a message that the 125 jet would be at Tehran Airport around 5:00 P.M. today , coming from Al Shargaz , a tiny independent sheikdom eight hundred miles south of Tehran on the other side of the Gulf where S-G had an office . " Did he say he had clearance , Freddy ? " McIver had asked excitedly . " I do n't know . All our HQ in Al Shargaz said : ETA Tehran 1700 , tell McIver  --  ca n't raise him , ' repeated several times . " " How 're things with you ? " " Five by five , " Ayre had said . " Starke 's still at Bandar Delam and we 've had no contact with them other than a snafu half an hour ago . " " Rudi sent that ? " McIver had tried to keep his voice level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and with us . What happened to your radio op this morning ? I tried calling for a couple of hours but no joy . " There had been a long pause . " He 's been detained . " " What the hell for ? " " I do n't know , Mac  --  Captain McIver . As soon as I know I 'll report it . Also , as soon as I can I 'll get Marc Dubois back to Bandar Delam , but , well , it 's a bit off here . We 've all been confined to base , there 's . . . there 's a charming and friendly armed guard here in the tower , all flights are grounded except for CASEVACs and even then we 've been ordered to take guards along  --  and no flights 're authorized out of our area . "  | " What 's it all about ? " " I do n't know . Our revered base commander , Colonel Peshadi , assured me it was temporary , just for today , perhaps tomorrow . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Captain Scragger in Charlie Echo Zulu Zulu en route with a special charter for Bandar Delam . " " What the hell 's he going there for ? " " I do n't know , sir . Old Scr  --  Captain Scragger said it 's been requested by de Plessey at Siri . I , er , I do n't think I 've much more time . Our friendly guard 's getting nervous but if you can get the 125 here Peshadi said he 'd clear her to land . I 'll try to send Manuela off but do n't expect much , she 's as nervous as a rabbit in a kennel full of beagles without real news of Starke . " " I can imagine . Tell her I 'm sending Gen. I 'll sign off now , God knows how long it 'll take me to get to the airport . " He had turned his attention to Genny . " Gen , pack a b  --  " " What do you want to take with you , Duncan ? " she had asked sweetly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be silly , dear . If you 're going to meet the 125 you 'd better hurry , but do be careful and do n't forget the photos ! Oh , by the way , I forgot to tell you that while you were trying to get into your office , Sharazad sent one of her servants over asking us to dinner . " " Gen , you are leaving with the 125 and that 's that ! " The argument had lasted no time at all . He had left and had used back roads , most of the main intersections clogged with milling crowds . Every time he was stopped he would hold up the Khomeini photograph with LONG LIVE THE AYATOLLAH in Farsi on the bottom and he would be waved through . He saw no troops , gendarmes , or police so he did not need the photo of the Shah with LONG LIVE GLORIOUS IRAN on the bottom . It still took two and a half hours for a journey that would normally take an hour , his anxiety about being late growing minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parallel runways , or the freight area apron , or near the terminal building across the field . Again he glanced at his watch : 5:17 P.M. Another hour of light . She 's cutting it fine , he told himself , if she arrives at all . God knows , they may have already turned her back . Near the terminal building several civilian jets were still grounded . One of them , a Royal Iranian Air 747 , was a twisted wreck , gutted by fire . The others seemed all right  --  he was too far away to see all their markings but among them would be the still-grounded Alitalia flight . Paula Giancani was still staying with them , Nogger Lane very much in attendance . She 's a nice girl that one , he thought absently . Ahead now was the gate of the freight area and depot . The depot had beenp272closed since last Wednesday  --  automatically on Thursday and Friday ( the Muslim Holy Day ) being the Iranian weekend  --  and there had been no way he or any of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate was open and unguarded . He swung through it into the forecourt . In front of him was the customs freight shed and barriers , signs everywhere in English andFarsi : NO ADMITTANCE , INBOUND , OUTBOUND , KEEP OUT , and company signsof the various international carriers and helicopter companies that had permanentoffices here . Normally it was almost impossible to drive into the forecourt . There was work around the clock for half a thousand men , handlingthe enormous quantity of goods , military and civilian , that poured into Iran in exchange for part of the $90 million daily oil revenue . But now the area was deserted . Hundreds of crates and cartons of all sizes were scattered in the snow  --  many broken open and looted , most sodden . A few abandoned cars and trucks , some derelict , and one truck burned out . Bullet holes in the sheds . The customs gate that barred the way to the apron was closed , held only by a bolt . The sign , in English and Farsi , read : NO ENTRY WITHOUT CUSTOMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one answered him so he got out , opened the gate wide , and got back into his car . A few yards the other side he stopped , rebolted the gate , then drove down the tarmac to the S-C stores and office shed and allied hangars and repair shop with space for four 212s and five 206s now containing three 206s , and one 212 . To his relief the main doors were still closed and locked . He had been afraid the stores and hangar might have been broken into and looted or wrecked . This was their main depot for repairs and spares in Iran . Over $2 million worth of spares and specialized tools were on the inventory , along with their own refueling pumps and underground tanks containing a highly secret cache of 50,000 gallons of helicopter fuel that McIver had " lost " when the troubles began in earnest . He scanned the sky . The wind told him the 125 would land from the west on runway 29 left but there was no sign of it . He unlocked the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilly foyer to the main office to the telex . It was switched off . " Bloody idiots , " he muttered out loud . Standing orders were for it to be on at all times . When he turned it on , nothing happened . He tried the lights but they did n't work either . " Bloody country . " Irritably he went over to the HF and UHF receiver-transmitters and switched them on . Both were battery-operated for emergencies . Their hum comforted him . " Echo Tango Lima Lima , " he said crisply into the mike , giving the 125 's registration letters : ETLL . " This is McIver , do you read ? " " Echo Tango Lima Lima  --  we certainly do , old boy , " the laconic answerp273came back at once . " It 's rather lonely up here  --  we 've been calling for half an hour . Where are you ? " " At the freight office . Sorry , Johnny , " he said , recognizing the voice of their senior fixed-wing captain . " Had a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where are you ? " " Seventeen miles due south  --  in the soup  --  passing through nine thousand on standard approach , expecting final on runway 29 left . What 's going on , Mac ? We ca n't raise Tehran Tower  --  in fact we have n't had a single callback ever since we came into Iran airspace . " " Good God ! Not even from Kish radar ? " " Not even from them , old boy . What 's amiss ? " " I do n't know . The tower was operating yesterday  --  up to midnight last night . The military gave us a clearance for a flight south . " McIver was astonished , knowing Kish radar was punctilious about all traffic inbound or outbound , particularly trans-Gulf . " The whole airfield 's deserted which is pretty hairy . Coming here there were crowds all over town , a few roadblocks , but nothing out of the ordinary , no riots or anything . " " Any problem for a landing ? " " I doubt if any landing aids are functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . Runway looks all right . " " What do you think ? " McIver weighed the pros and cons of a landing  --  without tower assistance or approval . " You 've enough fuel for the return trip ? " " Oh , yes . You 've a no-fuel capability ? " " Unless an emergency  --  for the moment . " " I 'm through the cloud cover at forty-seven hundred and have you in sight . " " Okay , Echo Tango Lima Lima . Wind 's from the east at about ten knots . Normally you 'd land on 29 left . The military base seems closed down and deserted so there should be no other traffic  --  all civilian flights in- and outboundhave been canceled . Suggest you make a pass and if it looks okay to you , come straight in  --  do n't hang around in the sky , there 're too many trigger-happy jokers about . Once you 've landed , turn around for a quick takeoff just in case . I 'll drive out to meet you . " " Echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiped his hands and forehead . But when he got up , his heart seemed to turn in his chest . Standing in the open doorway was a customs officer , his hand casually on his holstered gun . His uniform was soiled and crumpled , his roundish face grizzled with three or four days ' growth of beard.  | " Oh , " McIver said , fighting to appear calm . " Salaam , Agha . " He did not recognize him as one of their regulars . The man shifted his gun hand ominously , his eyes going from McIver to the radio sets and back to McIver . Haltingly , for McIver spoke very little Farsi , he said , " Inglissi me danid , Agha ? Be bahk shid man zaban-e shoma ra khoob nami danam . " Do you speak English , sir ? Please excuse me but I do n't speak your language . The customs officer grunted . " What you do here ? " he said in halting English , his teeth tobacco-stained . " I 'm . . . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , carefully and slowly . " I 'm just . . . just checking my telex and here to meet an incoming plane . " " Plane  --  what plane ? Wh  --  " At that moment the 125 came directly over the airport at one thousand feet . The Customs man hurried out of the office onto the tarmac , closely followed by McIver . They saw the lovely clean lines of the twin-engined jet against the murky overcast and watched a moment as she hurtled away to go into a steep bank to join the landing pattern . " What plane ? Eh ? " " It 's our regular flight  --  regular flight from Al Shargaz . " The name sent the man into a paroxysm of invective . " Be bahk shid nana dhan konan . " Sorry , I do n't understand . " No land . . . no land , understand ? " The man angrily pointed from the plane to the office with the HF . " Tell plane ! " McIver nodded calmly , not feeling calm , and beckoned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about $110 , and offered it . " Please accept the landing fee  --  landing money . " The man spurned it with more unintelligible Farsi . McIver put the money on the table , then walked past the man into the storeroom . He unlocked a door . In the small room , put there for just this purpose , were odds and ends of spares , and three full five-gallon cans of gasoline . He picked up one can and put it outside the door , remembering what General Valik had said : a pishkesh was not a bribe but a gift and a good Iranian custom . After a second , McIver decided to leave the door but left it open  --  three cans would more than guarantee no problem . " Be bahk shid , Agha . " Please excuse me , Excellency . Then he added in English , " I must meet my masters . " He went out of the building and got into his car and did not look back . " Bloody bastard , damn near gave me a heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , drove on to the taxi runway , and headed for the intercept point . The snow was only a few inches deep and not too bad . Hisp275were the only tracks , the main runways equally virgin . The wind had picked up , increasing the chill factor . He did not notice it , concentrating on the airplane . The 125 came around in a tight turn , gear and flaps down , sideslipping deftly to lose height and cut down the approach distance . John Hogg flared and touched down , letting her roll until it was safe and even then using brakes with great caution . He turned onto the taxi runway and increased power to meet McIver . Near the first access path back to the runway , he stopped . By the time McIver came alongside , the door was open , the steps down , John Hogg waiting at the foot , bundled in a parka , stamping his feet against the cold . " Hi , Mac ! " he called out  --  a neat , spare man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on in  --  it 'll be warmer for you . " " Good idea . " McIver hastily switched off and followed him up the steps . Inside it was snug , lights on , coffee ready , London newspapers in the rack . McIver knew there would be wine and beer in the refrigerator , a sit-down toilet with soft paper in the back-civilization again . He shook hands warmly with Hogg and waved at the copilot . " I 'm so glad to see you , Johnny . His mouth dropped open . Seated in one of the swivel chairs in the eight-place airplane , beaming at him , was Andy Gavallan . " Hello , Mac ! " " My God ! My God , Chinaboy , it 's good to see you , " McIver said , pummelinghis hand . " What the hell are you doing  --  why did n't you tell me you were coming  --  what 's the id  --  " " Slow down , laddie . Coffee ? " " My God , yes . " McIver sat opposite him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Great  --  wonderful ! Her second birthday coming and already she 's a holyterror ! Thought we 'd better have a chat so I got on the bird and here I am . " " Ca n't tell you how glad I am . You 're looking great , " McIver said . And he was . " Thank you , laddie , you 're not so bad yoursel ' . How are you , really , Mac ? " Gavallan asked more pointedly . " Excellent . " Hogg put down the coffee in front of McIver . With a small tot of whisky and another for Gavallan . " Ah , thanks , Johnny , " McIver said , brightening . " Health ! " He touched glasses with Gavallan and swallowed the spirit gratefully . " I 'm cold as charity . Just had a run-in with a bloody Customsman ! Why 're you here ? Any problem , Andy ? Oh , but what about the 125 ? Both the revs and loyalists are all very twitchy  --  either of them could arrive in force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye out for them . We 'll talk about my problemsin a minute but I decided that I 'd better come and see for myself . We 've too much at risk now , here and outside , with all our new , upcoming contracts and aircraft . The X63 's a total smash , Mac , everything and better ! " " Great , wonderful . When do we get her ? " " Next year  --  more about her later . Iran 's my top priority now . We have to have some contingency plans , how to keep in touch and so on . Yesterday I spent hours in Al Shargaz trying to get an Iranian clearance for Tehran but no joy on that . Even their embassy was closed ; I went to their Al Mullah building myself but it was closed tighter than a gnat 's arse . I got our rep to call the ambassador 's home but he was out to lunch  --  all day . Eventually I went to Al Shargaz Air Traffic Control and chatted them up . They suggested we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a stab and here we are . First what 's the state of our ops ? " McIver related what he knew . Much of Gavallan 's good humor vanished . " So Charlie 's vanished , Tom Lochart 's risking his neck and our whole Iranian venture  --  stupidly or bravely depending on your point of view  --  Duke Starke 's up the creek in Bandar Delam with Rudi , Kowiss is in a state of siege , and we 've been tossed out of our offices . " " Yes . " McIver added gruffly . " I authorized Tom 's flight . " " I 'd 've done the same , probably , if I 'd been on the spot , though it does n't excuse the danger to him , to us , or poor bloody Valik and his family . But I agree , SAVAK 's too smelly for anyone 's taste . " Gavallan was distinctly rattled though he showed none of it on his face . " Ian was right again . " " Ian ? Dunross ? You saw him ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai . " Gavallan told him what he had said . " What 's the latest on the political situation here ? " " You should know more than we do  --  we only get real news through the BBC or VOA . There 're still no newspapers and only rumors , " McIver said , but he was remembering the good times he had had with Dunross in Hong Kong . He had taught him to fly a small chopper the year before joining Gavallan in Aberdeen , and though they had not socialized very much , McIverhad enjoyed his company greatly . " Bakhtiar 's still top man with the forces behind him , but Bazargan and Khomeini 're gnawing at his heels . . . Oh , damn , I forgot to tell you , Boss Kyabi 's been murdered . " " Christ Almighty , that 's terrible ! But why ? " " We do n't know the why or how or by whom . Freddy Ayre told us obliqu  --  " " Sorry to interrupt , sir , " came over the loudspeaker , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're three cars stuffed with men and guns heading our way , coming from the terminal area . " Both men peered out of the small round windows . They could see the cars now . Gavallan picked up his binoculars and trained them . " Five or six men in each car . There 's a mullah in the front of the first car . Khomeini 's people ! " He slung the binoculars around his neck and was out of his seat quickly . " Johnny ! " Hogg was already at the door . " Yes , sir ? " " Plan B ! " At once Hogg gave the thumbs-up to his copilot who immediatelystarted to open the throttles as Gavallan struggled into a parka and picked up a light travel bag on the run . " Come on , Mac ! " He led the way down the steps two at a time , McIver just behind him . The moment they were clear , the steps pulled back , the door slammed closed , the engines picked up , and the 125 taxied away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mac  --  do n't watch them , watch her leave ! " It had all happened so rapidly McIver hardly had time to zip his parka . One of the cars peeled off to intercept but by now the 125 was careening down the runway . In seconds it took off and was away . Now they faced the oncoming cars . " Now what , Andy ? " " That depends on the welcoming committee . " " What the hell was Plan B ? " Gavallan laughed . " Better than Plan C , laddie . That was a shit or bust . Plan B : I get out , Johnny takes off at once , and tells no one he had to leave in a hurry , tomorrow he comes back to pick me up at the same time ; if there 's no contact , visually or by radio , then Johnny skips a day and comes an hour earlier  --  and so on for four days . Then he sits on his tail in Al Shargaz and waits for further instructions . " " Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely stayed overnight  --  them on guard in the plane , me with you . " The cars skidded to a stop , the mullah and Green Bands surrounding them , guns trained on them , everyone shouting . Suddenly Gavallan bellowed , " Allah-u Akbar , " and everyone stopped , startled . With a flourish he lifted his hat to the mullah who was also armed , took out an official-looking document  --  written in Farsi  --  that was heavily sealed with red wax at the bottom . He handed it to him . " It 's permission to land in Tehran from the new ' ambassadorin London , " he told McIver airily as men crowded around the mullah peering at the paper . " I stopped off in London to collect it . It says I 'm a VIP  --  on official business and I can arrive and leave without harm . "  | " How the devil did you manage that ? " McIver asked , admiringly . " Influence , laddie . Influence and a large heung yau . " He carefully added the Cantonese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a bearded youth near the mullah said , his accent American . " You are under arrest ! " " For what , my dear sir ? " " Illegal landings without permiss  --  " Gavallan stabbed at the paper . " Here is an official permission from your very own ambassador in London ! Up the revolution ! Long live Ayatollah Khomeini ! " The youth hesitated , then translated for the mullah . There was an angry exchange and mutterings among them . " You will together come with us ! " " We will follow in our car ! Come on , Mac , " Gavallan said firmly and got into the passenger seat . McIver turned on the ignition . For a moment the men were nonplussed , then the man who could speak English and another got into the back . Both carried an AK47 . " Go to terminal ! You under arrest . " In the terminal , near the Immigration barrier , were more hostile men and a very nervous Immigration official . At once McIver showed his airport pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they worked under license for IranOil and tried to talk them past but he was imperiously waved into silence . Meticulously and ponderously the official examined the paper and Gavallan 's passport  --  all the while the youths crowding them , the smell of bodies heavy . Then he opened Gavallan 's bag and searched it roughly but it contained just shaving gear , a spare shirt , underclothes , and night clothes . And a fifth of whisky . At once the bottle was confiscated by one of the young men , opened , and poured on the floor . " Dew neh loh moh , " Gavallan said sweetly in Cantonese , and McIver nearly choked . " Up the revolution . " The mullah questioned the official , and they could see the sweat and the fear in him . At length the youth who could speak English said , " The authoritieswill keep paper and passport and you explain more later . " " I will keep my passport , " Gavallan said easily . " The authorities keep . Enemies will suffer . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suffer Islamic punishments . His Excellencywants to know who on the airplane with you ? " " Just my crew of two . They 're on the manifest attached to the Permission to Land . Now , my passport , please , and that document . " " The authorities keep . Where you stay ? " McIver gave his address.  |p279The  man translated . Again there was a heated discussion . " I am to tell you : now your airplanes may not fly or landings without permissions first . All Iran airplanes  --  all airplanes now in Iran belong to the state an  --  " " Airplanes belong to their legal owners . Legal owners , " McIver said . " Yes , " the man said with a sneer , " our Islamic state is owners . You not like laws , leave . Leave Iran . We not ask you here . " " Ah , but you 're wrong . We , in S-G Helicopters , were invited here . We work for your government and have served IranOil for years . " The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic state owns oil not foreigners . You soon arrested with all others for great crime : stealing Iran oil ! " " Rubbish ! We 've stolen nothing ! " McIver said . " We 've helped Iran into the twentieth century ! We 've b  --  " " Leave Iran if you want , " the spokesman said again , paying no attention to him . " Now all orders come from Imam Khomeini , Allah protect him ! He says no landings or takeoffs without permission . Each time , one Khomeini guard goes with each airplane . Understand ? " " We understand what you say , " Gavallan replied politely . " May I ask that we have this in writing , as the Bakhtiar government may not agree . " The man translated this and there was a roar of laughter . " Bakhtiar is gone , " the man said through his own laughter . " That dog of a Shah man is in hiding . Hiding , you understand ? The Imam is the government ! Him alone . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We can go , then ? " " Go . Tomorrow report the authorities . " " Where  --  and what authorities ? " " Tehran authorities . " The man translated for the others and again everyonelaughed . The mullah pocketed the passport and paper and strode off importantly . Guards went with him , taking along the sweating Immigration officer . Most of the others wandered off , seemingly aimlessly . A few stayed watching them , lounging against the wall , smoking  --  their U.S. Army rifles slung carelessly . It was very cold in the terminal . And very empty . " He 's quite right you know , " a voice said . Gavallan and McIver looked around . It was George Talbot of the British embassy , a short dry man of fiftyfive , wearing a heavy raincoat and a Russian-style fur hat . He stood in the doorway of a customs office . Beside him was a tall , broad-shouldered man of sixty with hard , pale blue eyes , his mustache gray as his hair and clipped , and dressed casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both were smoking . " Oh , hello , George , nice to see you . " Gavallan went over to him , offering his hand . He had known him over the years , both in Iran and Malaya  --   |p280Talbot  's previous posting  --  where S-G also had an extensive oil support operation . " How long have you been here ? " " Just a few minutes . " Talbot stubbed out his cigarette , coughed absently . " Hello , Duncan ! Well , this is a fine kettle of fish , is n't it ? " " Yes . Yes , it is . " Gavallan glanced at the other man . " Ah , may I introduce Mr. Armstrong ? " Gavallan shook hands . " Hello , " he said , wondering where he 'd seen him before and who he was  --  the hardness to the eyes and strong face . Fifty pounds to a bent button he 's CIA if he 's American , he thought . " You 're embassy too ? " he asked casually to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " Gavallan had turned his ears and did not detect a pure English or Americanaccent . Might be either , or Canadian , he thought , difficult to tell on two words . " You 're here on official business , George ? " McIver asked . " Yes and no . " Talbot strolled over to the door that led back to the airport apron where McIver 's car was parked , guiding them away from prying ears . " Actually the moment we heard your incoming jet on the air , we , er , we hurried out here hoping you could take out some er , some dispatches for Her Majesty 's Government . The ambassador would have been most grateful , but , well , we were here just in time to see your plane take off . Pity ! " " I 'd be glad to help in any way , " Gavallan said as quietly . " Perhaps tomorrow ? " He saw the sudden glance between the two men and wondered even more what was amiss . " Is that possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible . " Gavallan pegged him to be English , though not all English . Talbot smiled , coughed without noticing it . " You 'll leave with or without Iranian permission , an official permit  --  or a passport ? " " I , er , do have a copy of the paper . And another passport  --  I applied for a spare , officially , against this eventuality . " Talbot sighed . " Irregular but wise . Yes . Oh , by the way , I would very much like a copy of your Official Permission to Land . " " Perhaps that 's not such a good idea  --  officially . You never know what larceny some people are up to these days . " Talbot laughed . Then he said , " If you , er , do leave tomorrow we would appreciate it if you 'd kindly take Mr. Armstrong  --  I presume AI Shargaz will be your first port of call . " Gavallan hesitated . " This is a formal request ? " Talbot smiled . " Formally informal . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  |p281Talbot  chuckled . " You 're perfectly correct to ask . I guarantee that Mr. Armstrong 's papers will be perfectly in order . " He added pointedly to finish the conversation , " As you so correctly pointed out there 's no accounting for the larceny some people will get up to these days . " Gavallan nodded . " Very well , Mr. Armstrong . I 'll be with Captain McIver . It 'll be up to you to stay in touch . The earliest ETD 'd be about 5:00 P.M. but I wo n't wait around for you . All right ? " " Thank you , sir . " Again Gavallan had been listening carefully but still could not decide . " George , when we started talking , you said of that arrogant little bastard , He 's quite right , you know . ' Right about what ? That now I 've to find or report to some nebulous authorities in Tehran ? " " No . That Bakhtiar 's resigned and in hiding . " Both men gaped at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally resigned a couple of hours ago and has , somewhat wisely , vanished . " Talbot 's voice was soft and calm , cigarette smoke punctuatinghis words . " Actually the situation 's suddenly rather dicey , hence our , er , anxiety to , er , well , never mind that . Last night the chief of staff , General Ghara-Baghi , supported by the generals , ordered all troops back into their barracks , declaring the armed forces were now neutral , ' thus leaving their legal prime minister defenseless and the state to Khomeini . " " Neutral ? ' " Gavallan echoed with disbelief . " That 's not possible  --  not possible  --  they 'd be committing suicide . " " I agree . But it is true . " " Christ ! " " Of course , only some of the units will obey , others will fight , " Talbot said . " Certainly the police and SAVAK are n't affected ; they wo n't give up though now their battle will be lost eventually . Insha'Allah , old boy . Meanwhile blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McIver broke the silence . " But . . . if Bakhtiar . . . does n't that mean it 's over ? It 's over , " he said with growing excitement . " The civil war 's over and thank God for that . The generals have stopped the real bloodbath  --  the total bloodbath . Now we can all get back to normal . The trouble 's over . " " Oh , no , my dear chap , " Talbot said even more calmly . " The trouble 's just begun . "  |p282AT  RIG BELLISSIMA : 6:35 P.M. The sunset was glorious , red-tinged clouds low on the horizon , clean clear sky , the evening star brilliant , a threequartermoon . But it was very cold here at twelve thousand five hundred feet , and already dark in the east and Jean-Luc had difficulty in picking out the incoming 212 . " Here she comes , Gianni , " Jean-Luc shouted at the driller . This would complete Scot Gavallan 's third round-trip . Everyone  --  riggers cooks , laborers , three cats and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been safely transported to Rig Rosa , with the exception of Mario Guineppa who had insisted on waiting till last , in spite of JeanLuc'spleadings , and Gianni , Pietro , and two others who were still shutting down the rig . Jean-Luc kept a wary eye on the overhang that worked from time to time , sending shivers down his spine . When the chopper had come back the firstp283time , everyone had held their breath at the noise even though Pietro had assured them all that was just an old wives ' tale  --  only dynamite would start an avalanche , or an Act of God . And then as if to prove him wrong the overhang shifted again , only a little but enough to nauseate those still left on the rig . Pietro pulled the last switch and the turbines of the diesel generators began to slow . He wiped his face tiredly and left an oil smear . His back ached and his hands hurt in the cold but the well was sealed and as safe as he could make it . Out over the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's leave , " he said to the others in Italian . " There 's nothing more that we can do here  --  nothing more to do except blow that shit roll above to hell ! " The others irritably crossed themselves and trudged off toward the helipad and left him . He looked up at the crest . " You look as though you 're alive , " he muttered , " a shit-roll monster waiting to get me and my beautiful wells . But you wo n't , you motherless whore ! " He went to the little dynamite storeroom and picked up the two exploders that he had made  --  six sticks of dynamite in each , wrapped around a thirtysecondfuse . Carefully he put them in a small carrying bag , with a lighter and matches as a backup . " Mother of God , " he prayed simply , " make these fornicators work . " " Pietro ! Hey , Pietro ! " " I 'm coming , I 'm coming , there 's plenty of time ! " Outside he saw the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's Guineppa  --  better take a look ! " Mario Guineppa lay on his back , his breath rattling in his throat , eyelids flickering . Jean-Luc was beside the bed , his hand on the man 's pulse . " It 's rapid ... then I ca n't feel it at all , " he said uneasily . " Mario had a serious medical four weeks ago , his annual  --  cardiogram , everything . Very serious . He was perfect ! " Pietro spat on the floor . " Doc-tors ! " " He was a fool to insist on waiting , " Gianni said . " He 's the boss , he does what he likes . Let 's put him on the stretcher and get going . " Pietro was grave . " There 's nothing we can do for him here . The hell with the dynamite , we 'll do it later or tomorrow . " Carefully they lifted him , wrapped him warmly , and carried him out of the trailer , through the snow , toward the waiting helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned . They looked up . Snow and ice began tumbling , gathering weight . In seconds the avalance was in full flood . There was no time to run , nothing to do but wait . The roar increased . Snow pouredp284down the mountain to carry the far trailer hut and one of the vast steel mud tanks into the abyss . Then it ceased . " Mamma mia , " Gianni gasped , crossing himself . " I thought we were gone that time . " Jean-Luc , too , had crossed himself . Now the overhang was even more ominous , thousands of tons poised over the site , part of the rock face exposed . Dribbles of snow fell continuously . " Jean-Luc ! " It was Guineppa . His eyes were open . " Do n't . . . do n't wait . . . dynamite now . . . must . . . must . " Pietro said , " He 's right , it 's now or never . " " Please . . . I 'm fine . . . Mamma mia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried for the chopper . The stretcher went across the forward bank of seats and was quickly lashed into place . The others put on their seat belts . Jean-Luc got into the cockpit left seat and put on his headset . " Okay , Scot ? " " Terrific , old chap , " Scot Gavallan said . " How 's Guineppa ? " " Not good . " Jean-Luc checked the instruments . Everything was in the Green and plenty of fuel . " Merde ! The overhang 's going any second ; let 's watch the up and down drafts , they 're liable to be rough . Allons-y ! " " Here  --  I rigged it for Pietro while I was waiting at Rosa . " Scot gave JeanLucthe spare headset that was now linked with theirs . " I 'll give it to him when we 're airborne . I do n't feel safe here ! Take off ! " At once Scot opened the throttles and eased the 212 off the ground , backed off a little , turned , and was over the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cabin . " Here , put these on , Pietro , now you 're connected with us up front . " " Good , very good . " Pietro had taken the seat nearest the door . " When we begin , for the sake of God , my health , and your mother , do n't fall out . " Pietro laughed nervously . Jean-Luc checked Guineppa who seemed more comfortable now , went forward again , and put on his headset . " You hear me , Pietro ? " " Si . Si , amico . " The chopper labored in a circling climb . Now they were on a level with the crest . From this angle the overhang did not seem so dangerous . They were beginning to bounce a little . " Go higher , another hundred feet , amico , " came through the headsets , " and more north . " " Roger , Pietro . You 're navigator now , " Scot said . The two pilots concentrated . Pietro showed them the spot on the north face where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rig . " It might work , " Scot muttered  |p285They  circled once to make sure . " Amico , when we 're over that spot at a hundred feet , hover ; I 'll light the fuse and throw her out . Buono ? " They could hear a tremble in Pietro 's voice . " Do n't forget to open the door , old chap , " Scot said dryly . There was a stream of Italian expletives in reply . Scot smiled , then a downdraft took them fifty feet before he caught it . In a minute they were to altitude and in position . " Good , amico , keep her there . " Jean-Luc turned around to watch . Behind in the cabin the other men stared at Pietro , fascinated . He took out the first charge and caressed the fuse straight , humming Aida . " Mother of God , Pietro , " Gianni said . " Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? " Pietro clenched his left fist , put his right with the fused dynamite on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get ready , up front , " he said into the boom mike , and unlocked his seat belt . He checked the position below , then nodded . " Good , keep her steady . Gianni , ready on the door . Open the fornicator a crack and I 'll do the rest . " The airplane was pitching with the gyrating air currents , as Gianni unlockedhis belt and went to the door . " Hurry up , " he said , feeling very unsafe , then added to the nearest man , " hold on to my belt ! " " Open the door , Gianni ! " Gianni fought it open a foot and held it there , the sick man on the stretcher forgotten . A roar of air filled the cabin . The airplane swirled , the added suction from the open door making it more difficult for Scot to control her . Pietro held up the fuse and thumbed the lighter . It failed . Again and again , each time more anxious than the last . " Mother of God , come on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter finally caught . The fuse spluttered into life . Holding on with one hand he leaned toward the door , wind eddies tugging at him . The airplane lurched and both men wished they had had the foresight to bring a safety harness . Carefully Pietro tossed the exploder through the opening . At once Gianni slammed the door closed and locked it . Then he began to swear . " Bombs away ! Let 's go ! " Pietro ordered , his teeth chattering from the cold , and buckled himself in again . At once the chopper peeled off and he was so relieved that it was done , he started to laugh . Hysterically the others joined him and all happily turned to watch below as he began to countdown : " . . . six . . . five . . . four . . . three . . . two . . . one ! " Nothing happened . As quickly as their laughter had arrived , it vanished . " Did you see it fall , Jean-Luc ? " " No . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wantingp286to repeat the maneuver . " Perhaps it hit a rock and the fuse got knocked away . " But inside he was saying to himself , Stupid Italian anus eater , ca n't even fix a few sticks of dynamite to a fornicating fuse . " We will do it again , yes ? " " Why not ? " Pietro said confidently . " The detonator was perfect . That it did not fire was an Act of the Devil . Yes , without a doubt  --  it happens many times in snow . Many times . Snow is a whore and you can nev  --  " " Do n't blame the snow , Pietro , and it was an Act of God , not of the Devil , " Gianni said superstitiously , crossing himself . " By my mother , enough of the Devil while we 're aloft . " Pietro took out the second charge and examined it carefully . The wire holding the sticks tight was firm and the fuse firm . " There , you see , perfect , just like the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other then banged it hard on his armrest to see if the fuse would dislodge . " Mamma mia , " one of the men said , his stomach turning over . " Are you mad ? " " This 's not like nitro , amico , " Pietro told him and banged it even harder . " There , you see it 's tight . " " It 's not as tight as my anus , " Gianni said angrily in Italian . " Stop it for the love of the Mother of God ! " Pietro shrugged and looked out of the window . The crest was approaching now . He could see the exact spot . " Get ready , Gianni . " Then into the boom mike , " Just a little more , Signor Pilot , more to the east . Hold her there . . . steady her . . . ca n't you keep her steadier ? Get ready , Gianni . " He held up the fuse , the lighter near to the end . " Open the fornicating door ! " Irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane twisted and he cried out , lost his footing , his weight went against the door , opening it wider , and he pitched out . But the man was holding his belt and he held Gianni there on the brink , half in , half out of the doorway , the wind suction tearing at them . The instant Gianni had opened the door , Pietro had thumbed the lighter and the fuse had caught but in the momentary panic over Gianni , Pietro was distracted . Instinctively he , too , had grabbed for Gianni and the dynamite was knocked out of his hand . They all watched appalled as he scrambled on the floor , reaching under the seats for it as it rolled this way and that , the fuse burning merrily  --  his headset torn off . Almost fainting with fear , Gianni got one hand firmly on the doorjamb and began to drag himself back , petrified that his belt would give way and cursing himself that he had worn this thin one that his wife had given him for Christmas . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his flesh ,  |p287burning  him , but he did not feel the pain . He got a firm grip then , still on the floor , squirmed around , hung on to a chair support and threw the dynamite and what was left of the fuse past Gianni overboard , then reached forward with his free hand and grabbed one of his friend 's legs , helping to drag him back . The other man slammed the door closed and the two of them , Pietro and Gianni , collapsed on the floor . " Take her away , Scot , " Jean-Luc said weakly . The chopper banked and left the north face two hundred feet below . For a moment the crest was pure and stark and motionless . There was a vast explosion that no one in the chopper felt or heard . Snow spiraled upward and began to settle . Then with a mighty roar , the whole of the north face tumbledaway , the avalanche fell into the valley , searing the mountainside with a swath a quarter of a mile wide until it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look ! " Scot said , pointing ahead . The overhang had vanished . Above the Bellissima rig was only a gentle slope , the site untouched except where the trailer and the single mud tank had already been carried away by the first avalanche . " Pietro ! " Jean-Luc called out excitedly . " You 've . . . " He stopped . Pietro and Gianni were still on the floor collecting themselves , Pietro 's headset vanished . " Scot , they wo n't be able to see from their windows  --  go closer and turn so they can see ! " Excitedly , jean-Luc climbed back into the cabin and began to pummel Pietro , congratulating him . Blankly everyone stared at him and when they understood what he was shouting over the screech of the engines , they forgot their fears and peered out of the windows . And when they saw how perfectly the explosion had cleaned away the danger , they let out a cheer . Gianni embraced Pietro emotionally , swearing eternal friendship , blessing him for saving him , for saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taro , " Pietro said expansively . " Am I not a man of Aosta ? " Jean-Luc stood over the stretcher and gently shook Mario Guineppa . " Mario ! Pietro did it  --  he did it perfectly . Bellissima 's safe . . . " Guineppa did not answer . He was already dead.  |p291ON  THE NORTH FACE OF MOUNT SABALAN : 10:00 A.M. The night was bitterly cold under a cloudless sky , stars abundant , the moon strong and Captain Ross and his two Gurkhas were working their way cautiouslyunder a crest following the guide and the CIA man . The soldiers wore cowled , white snow coveralls over their battle dress , and gloves and thermal underwear , but still the cold tormented them . They were about eight thousand feet , downwind of their target half a mile away the other side of the ridge . Above them the vast cone shape of the extinct volcano soared over sixteen thousand . " Meshgi , we 'll stop and rest , " the CIA man said in Turkish to the guide . Both were dressed in rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agha , then let it be so . " The guide led the way off the path , through the snow , to a small cave that none of them had noticed . HeIRAQ*TEHRANp292was old and gnarled like an ancient olive tree , hairy and thin , his clothes ragged , and still the strongest of them after almost two days ' climbing . " Good , " the CIA man said . Then to Ross , " Let 's hole up here till we 're ready . " Ross unslung his carbine , sat , and rested his pack gratefully , his calves and thighs and back aching . " I 'm all one big bloody ache , " he said disgustedly , " and I 'm supposed to be fit . " " You 're fit , sahib , " the Gurkha sergeant called Tenzing said with a beam . " On our next leave we go up Everest , eh ? " " Not on your Nelly , " Ross said in English and the three soldiers laughed together . Then the CIA man said thoughtfully , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ross saw him look out at the night and the thousands of feet of mountain below . When they had first met at the rendezvous near Bandar-e Pahlavi two days ago , if he had n't been told otherwise he would have thought him part Mongol or Nepalese or Tibetan , for the CIA man was dark-haired with a yellowish skin and Asian eyes and dressed like a nomad . " Your CIA contact 's Rosemont , Vien Rosemont , he 's half Vietnamese  --  half American , " the CIA colonel had said at his briefing . " He 's twenty-six , been here a year , speaks Farsi and Turkish , he 's second-generation CIA , and you can trust him with your life . " " It seems I 'm going to have to , sir , one way or another , do n't you think ? " " Huh ? Oh , sure , yes . Yes , I guess so . You meet him just south of Bandar-e Pahlavi at those coordinates and he 'll have the boat . You 'll hug the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then backpack in . " " He 's the guide ? " " No . He , er , he just knows about Mecca  --  that 's our code name for the radar post . Getting the guide 's his problem  --  but he 'll deliver . If he 's not at the rendezvous , wait through Saturday night . If he 's not there by dawn , he 's blown and you abort . Okay ? " " Yes . What about the rumors of insurrection in Azerbaijan ? " " Far as we know there 's some fighting in Tabriz and the western part  --  nothing around Ardabil . Rosemont should know more . We , er , we know the Soviets are massed and ready to move in if the Azerbaijanis throw Bakhtiar supporters out . Depends on their leaders . One of them 's Abdollah Khan . If you run into trouble go see him . He 's one of ours  --  loyal . " " All right . And this pilot , Charles Pettikin . Say he wo n't take us ? " " Make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the top forp293this op , both from your guys and ours , but we ca n't put anything into writing . Right , Bob ? " The other man at the briefing , a Robert Armstrong whom he had also never met before , had nodded agreement . " Yes . " " And the Iranians ? They 've approved it ? " " It 's a matter of , er , of national security  --  yours and ours . Theirs too but they 're . . . they 're busy . Bakhtiar 's , well , he 's  --  he may not last . " " Then it 's true  --  the U.S. are jerking the rug ? " " I would n't know about that , Captain . " " One last question : why are n't you sending your fellows ? " Robert Armstrong had answered for the colonel . " They 're all busy  --  we ca n't get any more here quickly  --  not with your elite training . " We 're certainly well trained , Ross thought , easing his shoulders cut raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ski , to snorkel , to kill silently or noisily , to move like the wind against terrorist or public enemy , and to blow everything sky-high if need be , above or under water . But I 'm bloody lucky , I 've everything I want : health , university , Sandhurst , paratroopers , Special Air Services , and even my beloved Gurkhas . He beamed at both of them and said a Gurkhali obscenity in a vulgar dialect that sent them into silent fits of laughter . Then he saw Vien Rosemont and the guide looking at him . " Your pardon , Excellencies , " he said in Farsi . " I was just telling my brothers to behave themselves . " Meshgi said nothing , just turned his attention back to the night . Rosemont had pulled off his boots and was massaging the chill out of his feet . " The guys I 've seen , British officers , they 're not friends with their soldiers , not like you . " " Perhaps I 'm luckier than others . " With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got up and was now standing at the mouth of the cave , listening . The old man had become increasingly edgy in the last few hours . How far do I trust him ? he thought , then glanced at Gueng who was nearest . Instantly the little man got the message , nodded back imperceptibly . " The captain is one of us , sir , " Tenzing was saying to Rosemont proudly . " Like his father and grandfather before him  --  and they were both Sheng'khan . " " What 's that ? " " It 's a Gurkhali title , " Ross said , hiding his pride . " It means Lord of the Mountain . Does n't mean much outside the Regiment . " " Three generations in the same outfit . That 's usual ? " Of course it 's not usual , Ross wanted to say , disliking personal questions , though liking Vien Rosemont personally . The boat had been on time , thep294voyage up the coast safe and quick , them hidden under sacking . Easily ashore at dusk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been waiting , fast into the foothills , and into the mountains , Rosemont never complaining but pressing forward hard , with little conversation and none of the barrage of questions he had expected . Rosemont waited patiently , noticing Ross was distracted . Then he saw the guide move out of the cave , hesitate , then come back and squat against the cave mouth , rifle cradled on his lap . " What is it , Meshgi ? " Rosemont asked . " Nothing , Agha . There are flocks in the valley , goats and sheep . " " Good . " Rosemont leaned back comfortably . Lucky to find the cave , he thought , it 's a good place to hole up in . He glanced back at Ross , saw him looking at him . After a pause he added , " It 's great to be part of a team . " " What 's the plan from now on ? " Ross asked . " When we get to the entrance of the cave , I 'll lead . You and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just as you like , but take Sergeant Tenzing with you . He can protect your tail  --  I ' 11 cover you both with Gueng . " After a pause , Rosemont nodded . " Sure , sounds good . Okay , Sergeant ? " " Yes , sahib . Please tell me what you want simply . My English is not good . " " It 's just fine , " Rosemont said , covering his nervousness . He knew Ross was weighing him like he was weighing them  --  too much at stake . " You just blow Mecca to hell , " his director had told him . " We 've a specialistteam to help you ; we do n't know how good they are but they 're the goddamn best we can get . Leader 's a captain , John Ross , here 's his photo and he 'll have a couple of Gurkhas with him , do n't know if they speak English but they come recommended . He 's a career officer . Listen , as you 've never worked close with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get personal or friendly or use first names too fast  --  they 're as sensitive as a cat with a feather up its ass about personal questions , so take it easy , okay ? " " Sure . " " Far as we know you 'll find Mecca empty . Our other posts nearer Turkey are still operating . We figure to stay as long as we can  --  by that time the brass 'll make a deal with the new jokers , Bakhtiar or Khomeini . But Mecca  --  goddamn those bastards who 've put us at so much risk . " " How much risk ? " " We think they just left in a hurry and destroyed nothing . You 've been there , for crissake ! Mecca 's stuffed with enough top secret gizmos , listening gear , seeing gear , long-range radar , locked in satellite ciphers and codes andp295computers to get our unfriendly KGB chief Andropov voted Man of the Year  --  if he gets them . Can you believe it  --  those bastards just hightailed it out ! " " Treason ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't even a contingency plan at Sabalan , for crissake  --  anywhere else either . Not all their fault , I guess . None of us figured the Shah 'd fold so goddamn quick , or that Khomeini 'd get Bakhtiar by the balls so fast . We got no warning  --  not even from SAVAK . . . " And now we have to pick up the pieces , Vien thought . Or , more correctly , blow them to hell . He glanced at his watch , feeling very tired . He gauged the night and the moon . Better give it another half an hour . His legs ached , and his head . He saw Ross watching him and he smiled inside : I wo n't fail , Limey . But will you ? " An hour , then we 'll move out , " Vien said . " Why wait ? " " The moon 'll be better for us . It 's safe here and we 've time . You 're clear what we do ? " " Mine everything in Mecca you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run like the clappers all the way home . " Rosemont smiled and felt better . " Where 's home for you ? " " I do n't know really , " Ross said caught unawares . He had never asked himself the question . After a moment , more for himself than the American , he added , " Perhaps Scotland  --  perhaps Nepal . My father and mother 're in Katmandu , they 're as Scots as I am but they 've been living there off and on since ' 51 when he retired . I was even born there though I did almost all my schooling in Scotland . " Both 're home , for me , he thought . " What about you ? " " Washington , D.C.  --  really , Falls Church , Virginia , which is almost part of Washington . I was born there . " Rosemont wanted a cigarette but he knew it might be dangerous . " Pa was CIA . He 's dead now but he was at Langley for the last few years , which 's close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to be talking . " Ma 's still in Falls Church , have n't been back in a couple of years . You ever been to the States ? " " No , not yet . " The wind had picked up a little and they both studied the night for a moment . " It 'll die down after midnight , " Rosemont said confidently . Ross saw the guide shift position again . Is he going to make a run for it ? " You 've worked with the guide before ? " " Sure . I tramped all over the mountains with him last year  --  I spent a month here . Routine . Lotta the opposition infiltrate through this area and wep296try to keep tabs on ' em  --  like they do us . " Rosemont watched the guide " Meshgi 's a good joe . Kurds do n't like Iranians , or Iraqis or our friends across the border . But you 're right to ask . " Ross switched to Gurkhali . " Tenzing , watch everywhere and the path finder  --  you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and was gone into the night . " I sent him on guard . " " Good , " Rosemont said . He had watched them all very carefully on the climb up and was very impressed with the way they worked as a team , leapfrogging , always one of them flanking , always seeming to know what to do , no orders , always safety catches off . " Is n't that kinda dangerous ? " he had said early on . " Yes , Mr. Rosemont  --  if you do n't know what you 're doing , " the Britisher had said to him with no arrogance that he could detect . " But when every tree or corner or rock could hide hostiles , the difference between safety on and off could mean killing or being killed . " Vien Rosemont remembered how the other had added guilelessly , " We 'll do everything we can to support you and get you out , " and he wondered again if they would get in , let alone out . It was almost a week since Mecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they got there  --  it could be intact , already stripped , or even occupied . " You know this whole op 's crazy ? " " Ours not to reason why . " " Ours but to do or die ? I think that 's the shits ! " " I think that 's the shits too if it 's any help . " It was the first time they had laughed together . Rosemont felt much better . " Listen , have n't said it before , but I 'm happy you three 're aboard . " " We 're , er , happy to be here . " Ross covered his embarrassment at the open compliment . " Agha , " he called out to the guide , " please join us at food . " " Thank you , Agha , but I am not hungry , " the old man replied without moving from the cave mouth . Rosemont put his boots back on . " You got a lot of special units in Iran ? " " No . Half a dozen  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He opened his pack and distributed the cans of bully beef . " No . The word in the hills among the tribes is that he 'll be out  --  probablyshot  --  within the week . " Ross whistled . " Bad as that ? " " Worse : that Azerbaijan 'll be a Soviet protectorate within the year . " " Bloody hell ! "  | " Sure . But you never know "  --  Vien smiled  --  " that 's what makes life inter-esting . " Casually Ross offered the flask . " Best Iranian rotgut money can buy . " Rosemont grimaced and took a careful sip , then beamed . " Jesus H. Christ , it 's real Scotch ! " He prepared to take a real swallow but Ross was ready and he grabbed the flask back . " Easy does it  --  it 's all we 've got , Agha . " Rosemont grinned . They ate quickly . The cave was snug and safe . " You ever been to Vietnam ? " Rosemont asked , wanting to talk , feeling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there once when my father and I were en route to Hong Kong but we were diverted to Bangkok from Saigon . " " With the Gurkhas ? " " No , this was years ago , though we do have a battalion there now . I was , " Ross thought a moment , " I was seven or eight , my father has some vague Hong Kong relations , Dunross , yes that was their name , and there was some sort of clan gathering . I do n't remember much of Hong Kong except a leper who lay in the dirt by the ferry terminal . I had to pass him every day  --  almost every day . " " My dad was in Hong Kong in ' 63 , " Vien said proudly . " He was deputy director of station  --  CIA . " He picked up a stone , toyed with it . " You know I 'm half-Vietnamese ? " " Yes , they told me . " " What else did they tell you ? " " Just that I could trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's hope they 're right . " Thoughtfully he began checking the action of his M16 . " I 've always wanted to visit Vietnam . My pa , my real pa , was Vietnamese , a planter , but he was killed just before I was born  --  that was when the French owned Indochina . He got clobbered by Viet Cong just outside Dien Bien Phu . Ma . . . " The sadness dropped off him and he smiled . " Ma 's as American as a Big Mac and when she remarried she picked one of the greatest . No real pa could 've loved me more . . . " Abruptly Gueng cocked his carbine . " Sahib ! " Ross and Rosemont grabbed their weapons , then there was a keening on the wind , Ross and Gueng relaxed . " It 's Tenzing . " The sergeant appeared out of the night as silently as he had left . But now his face was grim . " Sahib , many trucks on the road below  --  " " In English , Tenzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I counted eleven , in convoy , on the road at the bottom of the valley ... "  |p298Rosemont  cursed . " That road leads to Mecca . How far away were they ? " The little man shrugged . " At the bottom of the valley . I went the other side of the ridge and there 's a . . . " He said the Gurkhali word and Ross gave him the English equivalent . " A promontory . The road in the valley twists , then snakes as it climbs . If the tail of the snake is in the valley and the head wherever the road ends , then four trucks were already well past tail . " Rosemont cursed again . " An hour at best . We 'd bett  --  " At that moment there was a slight scuffle and their attention flashed to the cave mouth . They just had time to see the guide rushing away , Gueng in pursuit . " What the hell ... " " For whatever reason , he 's abandoning ship , " Ross said . " Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure . Plenty . " Quickly they got into their packs and Rosemont armed his light machine gun . " What about Gueng ? " " He 'll catch us up . " " We 'll go straight in . I 'll go first  --  if I run into trouble you abort . Okay ? " The cold was almost a physical barrier they had to fight through but Rosemont led the way well , the snow not bad on the meandering path , the moon helping , their climbing boots giving them good traction . Quickly they topped the ridge and headed down the other side . Here it was more slippery , the mountainside barren , just a few clumps of weeds and plants fighting to get above the snow . Ahead now was the maw of the cave , the road running into it , many vehicle tracks in the snow . " They could 've been made by our trucks , " Rosemont said , covering his disquiet . " There 's been no snow for a couple of weeks . " He motioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road and ran for the entrance . Tenzing followed , using the ground for cover , moving as rapidly . Ross saw Rosemont disappear into the darkness . Then Tenzing . His anxietyincreased . From where he was he could not see far down the road , for it curled away , falling steeply . The strong moonlight made the crags and the wide valley more ominous , and he felt naked and lonely and hated the waiting . But he was confident . " If you 've Gurkhas with you , you 've always a chance , my son , " his father had said . " Guard them  --  they 'll always guard you . And never forget , with luck , one day you 'll be Sheng'khan . " Ross had smiled to himself , so proud , the title given so rarely : only to one who had brought honor to the regiment , who had scaled a worthy Nepalese peak alone , who had used the kookri and had saved the life of a Gurkha in the service of the Great Raj . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1915 at the Battle of the Somme , had been given it posthumously ; his father ,  |p299Lieutenant  Colonel Gavin Ross , DSO , was given it in Burma , in 1943 . And me ? Well , I 've scaled a worthy peak  --  K4  --  and that 's all so far but I 've lots of time . . . . His fine-tuned senses warned him and he had his kookri out , but it was only Gueng . The little man was standing over him , breathing hard . " Not fast enough , sahib , " he whispered happily in Gurkhali . " I could have taken you moments ago . " He held up the severed head and beamed . " I bring you a gift . " It was the first that Ross had seen . The eyes were open . Terror still contortedthe face of the old man . Gueng killed him but I gave the order , he thought , sickened . Was he just an old man who was scared fartless and wanted to get out while the going was good ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray us to the enemy ? " What is it , sahib ? " Gueng whispered , his brow furrowed . " Nothing . Put the head down . " Gueng tossed it aside . The head rolled a little down the slope then stopped . " I searched him , sahib , and found this . " He handed him the amulet . " It was around his throat and this "  --  he gave him the small leather bag  --  " this hung down around his balls . " The amulet was just a cheap blue stone worn against the evil eye . Inside the little bag was a small card , wrapped in plastic . Ross squinted at it and his heart skipped a beat . At that moment there was another keening on the wind , the note different . Immediately they picked up their guns and ran for the cave mouth , knowing that Tenzing had given them the all-clear signal and to hurry . Inside the throat of the cavern the darkness seemed deeper and then , as their eyes adjusted , they saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens partially covered . " Over here , Captain . " Though it was softly said , Rosemont 's voice echoed loudly . " This way . " He led them farther into the cave and when he was sure it was safe he shone the light on the rock walls and all around to get his bearings . " It 's okay to use your flashes . " The cave was immense , many tunnelsand passages leading off it , some natural , some man-made , the rock dome fifty feet overhead . " This 's the unloading area , " he said . When he found the tunnel he sought he shone the light down it . At the end was a thick steel door , half open . " It should be locked , " he whispered , his voice raw . " I do n't know if it was left like that or what , but that 's where we have to go . Ross motioned to Tenzing . At once the kookri came out and the soldier went forward to vanish inside . Automatically Ross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked himself helplessly , feeling trapped . There could be fifty men hidden in any one of those other tunnels . The seconds dragged . Again there was the keening . Ross led the rush through the doorway , then Gueng , then Rosemont . As Rosemont passed the door he saw that Tenzing had taken up a position nearby and was covering them . He pulled the door to and switched on the lights . The suddenness made the others gasp . " Hallelujah ! " Rosemont said , openly relieved . " The brass figured if the generators were still working , we 'd have a good shot . This door 's lightproof . " He slid heavy bolts into place , hung his flashlight on his belt . They were in another cave , much smaller , that had been adapted , the floor leveled and carpeted roughly , the walls made more flat . It was a form of anteroom with desks and phones and litter everywhere . " The guys sure did n't waste any time getting the hell out , did they ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down it and into another cave room with more desks , a few radar screens , and more phones , gray and green . " The grays 're internal , greens go to the tower and masts on the crest , from there by satellite to Tehran , our HQ switchboard in the embassy , and various top secret places  --  they 've built-in scramblers . " Rosemont picked one up . It was dead . " Maybe the communications guys did their job after all . " At the far end of the room was a tunnel . " That goes down to the generator room for this section which has all the gear we 've to blow . Living quarters , kitchens , mess halls , repair shops , are in other caves off the unloading area . About eighty guys worked here around the clock . " " Is there any other way out of here ? " Ross asked . His feeling of being closed in was greater than ever . " Sure , topside , where we 're going . " Rough steps led upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing was a door : TOP SECURITY AREA  --  NO ADMITTANCE WITHOUT SPECIAL AUTHORITY . It too was open . " Shit , " he muttered . Thiscave was well-appointed , floor flatter , walls whitewashed . Dozens of computersand radar screens , and banked electronic equipment . More desks and chairs and phones , gray and green . And two red on a central desk . " What 're those for ? " " Direct to Langley by military satellite . " Rosemont picked one up . It was dead . So was the other . He pulled out a piece of paper and checked it , then went over to a bank of switches and turned some on . Another obscenity as a soft hum began , computers started chattering , warming up , and three of the radar screens came to life , the central white trace-line turning , leaving a scatter pattern in its wake . " Bastards ! Bastards to leave everything like this . "  |p301His  finger stabbed at four corner computers . " Blow those mothers  --  they 're the core . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gurkha took off his pack and began to lay out the plastic explosives and detonators . " Half-hour fuses ? " Rosemont said . " Half-hour fuses it is . " Ross was staring at one of the screens , fascinated . Northward he could see most of the Caucasus , all of the Caspian , eastward even part of the Black Sea , all with extraordinary clarity . " That 's a lot of space to peer into . " Rosemont went over to its keyboard and turned a switch . For a moment Ross was dumbfounded . He tore his eyes off the screen . " Now I understand why we 're here . " " That 's only part . " " Christ ! Then we 'd better get cracking . What about the cave mouth ? " " We 've no time to do a decent job  --  and the other side of our door 's routine junk they 've stolen anyways . We 'll blow our tunnels after us and use the escapeway . " " Where 's that ? " The American went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out a bunch of tagged keys and found the one he wanted . The door swung open . Behind the door a narrow flight of stairs spiraled upward steeply . " It leads out onto the mountain . " " Tenzing , make sure the way 's clear . " Tenzing went up the stairs two at a time . " Next ? " " Code room and the safes , we 'll mine those . Then communications . Generatorroom last , okay ? " " Yes . " Ross liked the incisive strength more and more . " Before we do you 'd better look at this . " He took out the small , plastic-covered card . " Gueng caught up with our guide . This was on him . " All color left Rosemont 's face . On the card was a thumbprint , some writingin Russian script , and a signature . " An ID ! " he burst out . " A Commie ID ! " Behind them Gueng paused momentarily . " That 's what I thought . What 's it say exactly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Russian either but I 'll bet my life it 's a safeconductpass . " A wave of sickness came up from his stomach as he remembered all the days and nights he had spent in the old man 's company , wanderingthe mountains , sleeping alongside him in the open , feeling very safe . And all the time he 'd been pegged . Numbly he shook his head . " Meshgi was with us for years  --  he was one of Ali bin Hassan Karakose 's band  --  Ali 's anp302underground leader and one of our best contacts in the mountains . Great guy who even operates as far north as Baku . Jesus , maybe he 's been betrayed . " He looked at the card again . " Just does n't figure . " " I think it figures we could have been deliberately set up , sitting ducks , " Ross said . " Perhaps the convoy 's part of it , full of troops to track us . We 'd better hurry it up , eh ? " Rosemont nodded , fighting to dominate the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other man . " Yes , yes , you 're right . " Still shattered , he went through a small passage to another door . Locked . As he looked for the key on the tabbed ring of keys he said , " I owe you and your men an apology . I do n't know how we  --  I  --  got taken in or how that bastard escaped the security check but he did and you 're probably right  --  we 're set up . Sorry , but , shit , that does n't help a goddamn bit . " " It helps . " Ross grinned and the fear dropped off both of them . " It helps . Okay ? " " Okay . Thanks , yes , thanks . Gueng killed him ? " " Well , " Ross said dryly . " He handed me his head . They usually just bring back ears . " " Jesus . You been with them long ? " " The Gurkhas ? Four years . " The key slid into the lock and the door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleprinter and copy machines . A curious computerprinter with a keyboard was on its own desk . " That 's the decoder  --  worth any money you 'd like to ask the opposition . " On the desks pencils were lined up . Half a dozen manuals . Rosemont picked them up . " Good sweet Jesus . . . " All were codebooks marked MECCA  --  ONE COPY ONLY . " Well , at least the master code 's locked up . " He went to the modern safe with its electronic , 0  --  9 digital lock that was set into one wall , read the combination from his piece of paper and touched the digits . But the Open light did n't come on . " Maybe I missed a number . Read them to me , okay ? " " Sure . " Ross began reading out the long series of numbers . Behind them Tenzing came in noiselessly . Neither man heard him . " . . . one twenty-five ... seven twenty-one . " Then both men felt the presence at the same instantand whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and closed his ears to the profanity . Had n't the Sheng'khan told him to train the son and make him wise in the ways of stealth and killing ? Had n't he sworn to guard him and be his silent teacher ? " But , Tenzing , for the love of God do n't let my son know I told you to . Keep this secret between us . . . . " It 's been very hard to catch the sahibp303unawares for weeks , he thought happily . But Gueng caught him tonight and so did I. Much better we do than an enemy  --  and now they surround us like bees and their queen . " The staircase leads upward for seventy-five steps to an iron door , " Tenzingsaid in his best reporting voice . " The door is rusty but I forced it . Outside is a cave , outside the cave is the night  --  a good escape route , sahib . Not good is that from there I saw the first of the convoy . " He paused , not wanting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . " " Go back to the first door , Tenzing , the one we barred . Mine the tunnel this side of the door to leave the door unharmed  --  twenty-minute fuse from now . Tell Gueng to set his fuses the same from now exactly . Tell Gueng what I 've ordered . " " Yes , sahib . " Ross turned back . He noticed the sweat on Rosemont 's forehead . " Okay ? " " Sure . We got to one hundred three . " " The last two numbers are six sixty and thirty-one . " He saw the American touch the numbers . The Open light began winking . Rosemont 's right hand went for the lever . " Hold it ! " Ross wiped the sweat from his own chin , the golden stubble rasping . " I suppose there 's no chance it could be booby-trapped ? " Rosemont stared at him , then at the safe . " It 's possible . Sure , it 's possi-ble . " " Then let 's just blow the bugger and not risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . I 've got to check if Mecca 's master code 's inside or not . That and the decoder 're priority . " Again he looked at the light winking at him . " You go back in the other room , take cover with Gueng , shout when you 're ready . I  --  it 's my shot . " Ross hesitated . Then he nodded , picked up both packs that contained explosives and detonators . " Where 's the communications room ? " " Next door . " " Is  --  is the generator room important ? " " No . Just this one , the decoder and those four mothers back there , though it 'd be best if this whole goddamn floor went to hell . " Rosemont watched Ross walk away then turned his back and looked back at the lever . There was a bad tightness in his chest . That sonofabitch Meshgi ! I 'd 've bet my life  --  you did , we all did , even Ali Karakose . " You ready ? " he called out impatiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back beside him before he had heard him , in his hands a long , thin , nylon climbing rope that , quickly ,  |p304he  lashed to the lever . " Turn the lever when I say but do n't open the door . We 'll jerk it open from back there . " Ross hurried out . " Now ! " Rosemont took a deep breath to slow his heart and turned the lever to Open then ran through the passage into the other cave . Ross beckoned him down beside the wall . " I sent Gueng to warn Tenzing . Ready ? " " Sure . " Ross tightened the rope , then tugged hard . The rope remained taut . He tugged even harder , then it slackened a foot but came no farther . Silence . Nothing . Both men were sweating . " Well , " Ross said , greatly relieved , and got up . " Better safe than sorr  --  " The explosion obliterated his words , a great cloud of dust and bits of metal blew out of the passage into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering tables and chairs . All radar screens burst , lights vanished , one of the red phones tore loose and hurtled across the room to smash through the steel casing of a computer . Gradually the dust settled , both men coughing their hearts out in the darkness . Rosemont was the first to recover . His flashlight was still on his belt . He groped for it . " Sahib ? " Tenzing called out anxiously , rushing into the room , his flash on , Gueng beside him . " I 'm all  --  all right , " Ross said , still coughing badly . Tenzing found him lying in the rubble . A little blood was running down his face but it was only a superficial wound from the flying glass . " Bless all gods , " Tenzing muttered and helped him up . Ross fought to stay upright . " Christalmighty ! " Blankly he looked around at the wreckage , then stumbled after Rosemont through the passage into the cipher room . The safe had vanished , with it the decoder , manuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All electronic equipment was just a mess of twisted metal and wires . Small fires had already started . " Jesus , " was all Rosemont could say , his voice little more than a croak , his psyche revolted by the nearness to extinction , mind screaming : run , escape this place of your death .. . " Christ all bloody mighty ! " Helplessly , Rosemont tried to say something , could n't , his legs took him into a corner and he was violently sick . " We 'd better  --  " Ross found it hard to talk , his ears still ringing , a monstrousache in his head , adrenaline pumping , trying to dominate his own wish to run . " Tenzing , are  --  are you finished ? " " Two minutes , sahib . " The man rushed off . " Gueng ? " " Yes , sahib . Two minutes also . " He hurried away.  |p305Ross  went to the other corner and retched . Then he felt better . He found the flask and took a long swig , wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over and shook Rosemont who was leaning against the wall . " Here . " He gave it to him . " You all right ? " " Yes . Sure . " Rosemont still felt queasy , but now his mind was working . His mouth tasted foul and he spat the foulness into the rubble . Small fires burned , throwing crazy shadows on the walls and roof . He took a careful sip . After a moment he said , " Nothing on God 's earth like Scotch . " Another sip and he handed the flask back . " We 'd better get the hell out of here . " With the flashlight he made a quick search of the wreckage , found the twisted remains of the all-important decoder , and picked his way carefully into the next cave and laid the remains near the charge at the base of the corner computers . " What I do n't understand , " he said helplessly , " is why the whole goddamn place did n't go up and blow us all to hell anyway  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  before I came back with the rope and sent Gueng off to Tenzing , I told Gueng to remove the explosives and the detonators for safety . " " You always think of everything ? " Ross smiled weakly . " All part of the service , " he said . " Communications room ? " It was mined quickly . Rosemont glanced at his watch . " Eight minutes to blast-off . We 'll forget the generator room . " " Good . Tenzing , you lead . " They went up the escape staircase . The iron hatch creaked as it opened . Once in the cave Ross took the lead . Cautiously he peered out at the night and all around . The moon was still high . Three or four hundred yards away the lead truck was grinding up the last incline . " Which way , Vien ? " he asked and Rosemont felt a glow . " Up , " he said , hiding the warmth . " We climb . If there 're troops after us , we forget the coast and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the way we came . " Tenzing led . He was like a mountain goat , but he picked the easiest path , knowing the two men were still very shaky . Here the slope was steep but not too difficult with little snow to impede them . They had barely started when the ground shook beneath them , the sound of the first explosion almost totally muffled . In quick succession there were other small quakes . One to go , Rosemont thought , glad of the cold which was clearing his head . The last explosion  --  the communications room  --  where they had used all their remaining explosive was much bigger and really shuddered the earth.  |p306Below  and to their right , part of the mountain gave way , smoke billowing out of the resulting crater . " Christ , " Ross muttered . " Probably an air vent . " " Sahib . Look down there ! " The lead truck had stopped at the entrance to the cave . Men were jumpingout of it , others staring up at the mountainside , illuminated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles . Ross and the others slid deeper into the shadows . " We 'll climb up to that ridge , " Rosemont said softly , pointing above and to their left . " We 'll be out of their sight and covered . Then we head for Tabriz , almost due east . Okay ? " " Tenzing , on you go ! " " Yes , sahib . " They made the ridge and hurried over it to climb again , working their way eastward , not talking , conserving their energy for there were many , many miles to go . The terrain was rough and the snow harried them . Soon their gloves were torn , hands and legs bruised , calves aching but , no longer encumIh beredby heavy packs , they made good progress and their spirits were high . They came to one of the paths that crisscrossed the mountains . ' Whenever the path forked , their choice was always to keep to the heights . There were villages in the valley , very few up this high . " Better we stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and hope we do n't run into anyone . " " You think they 'll all be hostile ? " " Sure . It 's not only anti-Shah country here but anti-Khomeini , anti-everyone . " Rosemont was breathing heavily . " It 's village against village most of the time and good bandit country . " He waved Tenzing onward , thankful for the moonlight and that he was with the three of them . Tenzing kept up the pace but it was a mountaineer 's pace , measured and unhurried and constant and punishing . After an hour Gueng took over the lead , then Ross , Rosemont , and then Tenzing again . Three minutes ' rest an hour , then on again . The moon sank lower in the sky . They were well away now , the going easier , lower down the mountainside . The path meandered but it led generallyeastward toward a curiously shaped cleft in the range . Rosemont had recognized it . " Down in that valley 's a side road that goes to Tabriz . It 's little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay . Let 's go on till dawn , then rest up and make a plan . Okay ? " Now they were down below the tree line and into the beginnings of the pine forest , going much slower and feeling the tiredness . Tenzing still led . Snow muffled their footsteps and the good clean airp307pleased him greatly . Abruptly he sensed danger and stopped . Ross was just behind him and he stopped also . Everyone waited motionless . Then Ross went forward carefully . Tenzing was peering into the dark ahead , the moon casting strange shadows . Slowly both men used their peripheral vision . Nothing . No sign or smell . They waited . Some snow fell from one of the trees . No one moved . Then a night bird left a branch ahead and to the right and flew noisily away . Tenzing pointed in that direction , motioned Ross to wait , slid his kookri out , and went forward alone , melting into the night . After a few yards Tenzing saw a man crouched behind a tree fifty yards ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man was oblivious of him . Closer . Then his peripheral vision saw a shadow move to his left , another to his right and he knew . " Ambush ! " he shouted at the top of his lungs and dived for cover . The first wave of bullets passed near him but missed . Part of the second punctured his left lung , ripped a hole out of his back , slamming him against a fallen tree . More guns opened up on the opposite side of the pathway , the crossfire racking Ross and the others , who had scrambled behind tree trunks and into gullies . For a moment Tenzing lay there helplessly . He could hear the firing but it seemed far away though he knew that it must be near . With a last mighty effort he dragged himself to his feet and charged the guns that had killed him . He saw some of their attackers turn back on him and heard bullets pass him , some tugging at his cowl . One went through his shoulder but he did not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regiment were supposed to die . Going forward . Fearlessly . I am truly without fear . I am Hindu and I go to meet Shiva contentedly , and when I am reborn I pray Brahma , Vishnu , Shiva that I will be born again Gurkha . As he reached the ambush , his kookri hacked off someone 's arm , his legs gave out , a monstrous , peerless light went off in his head and he strode into death without pain . " Hold all fire , " Ross called out , getting his bearings , pulling the strings of battle back into his hands . He pegged two groups of guns against them , but there was no way that he could get at either . The ambush had been well chosen and the crossfire deadly . He had seen Tenzing hit . It had taken all of his willpower not to go to his aid but first there was this battle to win and the others to protect . The shots were echoing and reechoing off the mountainside . He had wriggled out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully automatic , not knowing how to lead the way out of the trap . Then he had seen Tenzing reel to his feet with a battle cry and charge up the slope , creating the diversion Ross needed . At once he ordered Rosemont ,  | " Cover me , " and to Gueng , " Go ! " pointing toward the same group Tenzing was attacking . Immediately Gueng jumped out of his gully and rushed them , their attentiondiverted by Tenzing . When he saw his comrade go down , his rage burst , he let the lever on his grenade fly off , hurled it into their midst and hit the snow . The instant the grenade exploded he was up , his carbine spraying the screams , stopping most of them . He saw one man rushing away , another desperately crawling off into the underbrush . One slash of the kookri took off part of the crawler 's head . A short burst cut the other to pieces and again Gueng whirled into cover , not knowing where the next danger would come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the path . Ross had crawled forward out of safety . Bullets straddled him but Rosemont opened up with short bursts , drawing fire , giving Ross the help he needed , and he made the next tree safely , found a deep trough in the snow , and fell into it . For a second he waited , collecting his breath , then scrambled along the hard , frozen snow toward the firing . Now he was out of sight of the attackers and he made good time . Then he heard the other grenade go off and the screaming , and he prayed that Gueng and Tenzing were all right . The enemy firing was getting closer , and when he judged that he was in position , he pulled the pin out of the first grenade and with his carbine in his left hand went over the top . The instant he was in the open he saw the men but not where he had expected them . There were five , barely twenty yards away . Their rifles turned on him but his reactions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a tree , the lever off and counting before the first barrage ripped into it . On the fourth second he reached around the tree and lobbed the grenade at them , buried his head under his arms . The explosionlifted him off the ground , blew the trunk of a nearer tree to pieces , burying him under branches and snow from its limbs . Down by the path Rosemont had emptied his magazine into where he thought the attackers would be . Cursing in his anxiety , he slapped in a new magazine and fired another burst . Across the path on the other slope , Gueng was huddled behind a rock waiting for someone to move . Then , near the exploded tree , he saw one man running away , bent double . He aimed and the man died , the shot echoing . Now silence . Rosemont felt his heart racing . He could wait no longer . " Cover me , Gueng , " he shouted and leaped to his feet and rushed for the tree . A flicker of firing to his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other slope . A bubbling scream and the firing ceased . Rosemont ran onwardp309until he was straddling the ambush point , his carbine leveled . Three men were in pieces , the last barely alive , their rifles bent and twisted . All wore rough tribal clothes . As he watched , the last man choked and died . He turned away and rushed for the other tree , pulling branches away , fighting his way through the snow to Ross . On the other slope Gueng waited and watched to kill anything that moved . There was a slight stir amid the carnage behind the rocks where his grenade had ripped the three men apart . He waited , hardly breathing , but it was only a rodent feeding . Soon they will clean the ground and make it whole again , he thought , awed by the cycle of the gods . His eyes ranged slowly . He saw Tenzing crumpled to one side of the rock , his kookri still locked in his grasp . Before I leave I will take it , Gueng thought ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equal honor . Tenzing Sheng'khan lived and died like a man and will be reborn as the gods decide . Karma . Another movement . Ahead in the forest . He concentrated . The other side of the path Rosemont was pulling at the branches , fighting them away , his arms aching . At last he reached Ross and his heart almost stopped . Ross was crumpled on the ground , his arms over his head , his carbine nearby . Blood stained the snow and the back of the white coveralls . Rosemont knelt and turned him over and almost cried out with relief that Ross was still breathing . For a moment his eyes were blank , then they focused . He sat up and winced . " Tenzing ? And Gueng ? " " Tenzing got clobbered , Gueng 's the other side covering us . He 's okay . " " Thank God . Poor Tenzing . " " Test your arms and legs . " Gingerly Ross moved his limbs . Everything worked . " My head hurts like hell , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attackers . " Who are they ? " " Tribesmen . Bandits maybe . " Rosemont studied the way ahead . Nothing moved . The night was fine . " We 'd better get the hell out of here before more of the bastards jump us . You think you can go on ? " " Yes . Give me a couple of seconds . " Ross wiped some snow over his face . The cold helped . " Thanks , eh ? You know . Thanks . " Rosemont smiled back . " All part of the service , " he said wryly . His eyes went to the tribesmen . Keeping well down he went over to them and searched where he could . He found nothing . " Probably locals  --  or just bandits . These bastards can be real cruel if they catch you alive . " Ross nodded and another spasm of pain soared . " I 'm okay now , I think . We 'd better move  --  the firing must have been heard for miles and this 's no place to hang around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " " No . I 'll feel better moving . " Ross gathered his strength , then called out in Gurkhali , " Gueng , we 'll go on . " He started to get up , stopped as an abrupt keening for danger answered him . " Get down ! " he gasped and pulled Rosemont with him . A single rifle bullet came out of the night and chose Rosemont and buried itself in his chest , mortally wounding him . Then there was firing from the other slope and a scream and silence once more . In time , Gueng joined Ross . " Sahib , I think that was the last . For the moment . " " Yes . " They waited with Vien Rosemont until he died , then did what they had to do for him and for Tenzing . And then they went on.  |p311ISFAHAN  MILITARY AIR BASE : 5:40 A.M. To the east the dark night was beginning to lighten with the dawn . The base was quiet now , no one about except for armed Islamic Guards who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mullahs , had stormed the base yesterday and now possessed it , all army and air force officers and men confined to their barracks under guard  --  or free , openly declared now for Khomeini and the revolution . The sentry Relazi was eighteen and very proud of his green armband and to be on guard outside the shed that contained the traitor General Valik and his family who had been caught yesterday , skulking in the officers ' mess with his CIA foreign pilot . God is great , he thought . Tomorrow they will be cast into hell with all foul People of the Left Hand . For generations the Relazis had been cobblers in one tiny stall of Isfahan 's Old Bazaar . Yes , he thought , I was a bazaari until a week ago when ourp312mullah called me and all the Faithful to God 's battle , gave me God 's armbandand this gun and showed me how to use it . How wonderful are the ways of God . He was sheltered in the lee of the hut , out of the snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was wearing all the clothes he possessedin the world  --  sweatshirt , a coarse shirt over it , a coat and trousers bought secondhand , an old sweater and ancient army coat that once had belonged to his father . His feet felt numb . " As God wants , " he said out loud11 1 and felt better . " I 'll be relieved soon and then I 'll eat again  --  by God , soldiers lived like veritable pashas , at least two meals every day , one with rice , imagine that , and pay every week . . . pay from Satan but pay even so . " He coughed badly , his breath wheezing , shifted the U.S.Army carbine to his other shoulder , found the stub of the cigarette he had been saving , and lit it . By the Prophet , he thought gleefully , who would have imagined that we could take the base so easily , so few of us killed and sent to Paradise before we had overwhelmed the soldiers onthe gate and swarmed into the camp  --  our brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others seizing the aircraft and helicopters to prevent escape of the Shah traitors . Rushing the bullets of the enemy , the Name of God on our lips . " Join us , brothers , " we shouted , " join God 's revolution , help do God 's work ! Come to Paradise . do n't go to hell . . " The young man trembled and began to mouth the words imprinted on him by a dozen mullahs reading from the Koran , then translating : " there to live forever with allsinners and the accursed People of the Left Hand , tasting neither refreshment nor any drink but boiling water or molten metal anddecaying filth . And when the fires of hell have burned away the skin , they will grow new ones so that their suffering be never ending ... " He closed his eyes with the intensity of his prayers : Let me die with one of God 's names on my lips , and so guarantee that I will go straight to the Garden of Paradise with all the People of the Right Hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never to watch brothers and sisters of the villages with bloated bellies whimper into death , never to cry out in the night at the awfulness of life but to be in Paradise : " there to lie on silken couches adorned with robes of green silk , attended by fresh blooming youths bearing goblets and ewers and cups of flowing wine , with such fruits that please us best and the flesh of such birds as we shall long for . And ours shall be the houris with large dark eyes like pearls hidden in their shells , forever young , forever virgin , amid trees clad with fruit , and in extended shade and by flowing waters , never growing old , forev  --  " The rifle butt pulverized his nose and caved in the front of his skull ,  |p313|permanently  blinding him and ending forever his normality but not killing him before he tumbled unconscious into the snow . His assailant was a soldier , of an age with him , and this man hastily picked up the carbine  --  used it to break the lock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the assailant whispered , sweating with fear . In a moment GeneralValik poked his head out cautiously . The man grabbed his arm . " Come on , hurry , by God , " he snarled . " May God bless you .. . " Valik said , his teeth chattering , then darted back and came out again with two huge bundles of rials that the man stuffed into his battle dress and vanished as silently as he had arrived . Valik hesitated a moment , his heart driving . He saw the carbine in the snow and picked it up , loaded it , and slung it over his shoulder , then grabbed up the attache case , blessing God that the revolutionaries had been too hasty in their search to discover its false bottom before they were shoved in here to await the coming of the Tribunals . " Follow me , " he whispered urgently to his family . " But in the Name of God make no noise . Follow me carefully . " He pulled his coat closer around him and led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eight-year-old son , Jalal , and his daughter Setarem , six , hesitated in the doorway . All wore ski clothes  --  Annoush a mink over hers that the Islamic Guards had taunted her about as an open representation of the wages of sin . " Keep it with you , " they had said contemptuously , " that alone damns you ! " In the night she had been happy for its warmth , huddled on the dirt floor in the unheated shed , wrapping the children in it . " Come along , my darlings , " she whispered , trying to keep her terror from them . The sentry 's body blocked their way as he lay in the snow , moaning softly . " Mama , why does he sleep in the snow ? " the little girl asked in a whisper . " Never mind , my darling . Let 's hurry . Not a sound now ! " Silently she stepped over him . The little girl could not quite make it and had to tread on him , and she stumbled , sprawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just scrambled to her feet helped by her brother . Together , hand in hand , they hurried onward . Valik guided them carefully . When they reached the hangar where the 212 was still parked , he breathed a little easier . This area was well away from the main camp , the other side of the enormousrunway . Making sure there were no guards nearby he ran out to the chopper and peered into the cabin . To his enormous relief no guards were asleep inside . He tried the door . It was not locked . He slid it open as quietly as he could , and beckoned the others . Silently they joined him . He helped them up and got in after them , sliding the door to , locking it from the inside.  |p314Quickly  he made the children comfortable on some blankets under the jump seats , cautioning them not to make their presence known whatever happened . Then he sat beside his wife , wrapped a blanket around his shoulders , for he was very cold , and held her hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cry . It wo n't be long now , " he whispered , gentling her . " We wo n't have to wait long . Insha'Allah . " " Insha'Allah , " she echoed brokenly , " but the whole world 's gone mad . . . thrown into a filthy outhouse like criminals . . . what 's going to happen to us . . . " " With the Help of God we 've got this far , so why not all the way to Kuwait ? " They had arrived here yesterday just before noon . The flight from the pickup outside of Tehran had been without incident , all airwaves silent . His trusted chauffeur of fifteen years had driven his car back to Tehran , with orders to tell no one that they had " gone to their house on the Caspian . " " In this escape we trust no one , " Valik had told his wife while they were waiting for the chopper to arrive . She had said , " Of course , but we should have brought Sharazad , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us onward . " " No , she 'd never have left , why should she ? " Valik had said . " With or without Sharazad , he is not to be trusted  --  he 's alien and not one of us . " " It would have been wiser to have brought her . " " No , " he had said , knowing what would have to be done with Lochart . All the way from Tehran to Isfahan he had sat in the front with Lochart . They had stayed low , avoiding towns and airfields . When Lochart had called Isfahan Military Base Control they were obviously expected . The tower had given them directions where to land with an order not to call again and to observe radio silence . Air Force Brigadier General Mohammed Seladi , Valik 's uncle , who had arranged for them to land and to refuel , met them at the helipad . The general had greeted them somberly . As it was near lunchtime he said they should eat on the base before going on . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft , " Valik had told him . " I must insist , " Seladi had said nervously , " I must insist , Excellency . You should pay your respects to the commandant . It is necessary , and , er , we must talk . " It was during this time that the Green Bands and the mob had burst through the gates , swarmed over the station , arrested them all , and had taken Lochart to another part of the base . Sons of dogs , Valik thought angrily , mayp315they all burn in hell ! I knew at the time we should have just refueled and gone on at once . Seladi 's a blundering fool . It 's all his fault . . . In an upper story of a barrack a quarter of a mile away . Tom Lochart was sleeping fitfully . Suddenly he was awakened by a scuffle outside in the corridor , the door burst open , and he was half blinded by a flashlight . " Quick , " a voice said in American English and two men helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran off . A split second to collect himself then Lochart rushed in pursuit , along the corridor , down three flights of stairs , and into the open . There he stopped with the others , his breathing heavy . He just had time to see that both men were officers , a captain and a major , before they were off again in the semidarkness , running hard . Dawn brightened the eastern sky . Snow fell lightly , helping to hide them , and muffling their footsteps . Ahead was a guardhouse with a wood fire outside , a few sleepy inattentive revolutionaries huddled around it . The three men diverted and ran down between a line of barracks , diverted again into an alleyway as a truck filled with chanting guards came around a corner , then rushed into the open , along the boundary road for the far hangar and the 212 . In the lee of the hangar , they stopped to catch their breath . " Listen , pilot , " the major said , panting , " when I give the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ready ? " " What about the others ? " Lochart asked , a stitch in his side and hardly able to talk . " What about General Valik and his fam  --  " " Forget them . Ali , " the major jerked his thumb at the other man , " Ali goes in front with you and I 'm in the back . How long will it take to get airborne once you start up ? " " Minimum . " " Make it less , " the major said . " Come on ! " They rushed for the 212 , Lochart and Ali , the captain , heading for the cockpit . At that moment Lochart saw a car without headlights charging along the boundary road toward them and his heart seemed to stop . " Look ! " " In Cod 's name , hurry , pilot ! " Lochart redoubled his efforts , jumped into the pilot 's seat , shoved in the circuit breakers , switched on , and began to crank her up . At the same moment the major reached the sliding door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbine was shoved in his face by Valik . " Oh , it 's you , Major ! Praise be to God ... " " Praise be to God you 're here and made your escape , Excellency , " the major gasped , forced his panic away , and clambered in , the engines alreadyp316winding the blades but nowhere near airspeed yet . " Praise be to God you made your escape . . . but where 's the soldier ? " " He just took the money and fled . " " Did he bring the guns ? " " No , this is all h  --  " " Son of a dog ! " the major said furiously , then shouted at Lochart , " In the Name of God hurryyyyyyy ! " He whirled and looked at the approaching car . It was closing fast . He grabbed the carbine from Valik , kneeled in the doorway , aimed at the driver , and squeezed the trigger . The burst was high  --  as behind him Annoush and the children cried out in terror  --  the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of sheds , came into view for an instant to dart around the hangar and disappear again . Lochart had his headset on and was watching the needles climbing , willing them to hurry . " Come on , goddamnit , " he muttered , hands and feet ready on the controls , the scream of the jets growing , the captain beside him praying openly . He could not hear Annoush sobbing in the back or the petrified children who had scrambled out of their hiding place to bury themselves in her skirts , or Valik and the major raging at him to hurry . Needles climbing . Still climbing . Still climbing . Almost in the Green . Now ! His left hand started to raise the collective lever but the car whirled around the hangar and came at them head-on to stop fifteen yards away . Five men jumped out of it  --  one rushed directly at the cockpit and pointed an automatic rifle at him , the others went for the cabin door . He was almost airborne but knew he was a dead man if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily motion him to stop . He obeyed , then swung around to look into the back . The other men were clambering in . They were all officers , Valik and the major were embracing them and being embraced , then he heard , " Take off , for crissake ! " in his headset and felt a shove in the ribs . It was Ali , the captain , beside him . " Take off ! " Ali said again , his English American-accented , and gave a thumbs-up to the man outside still aiming at them . The man rushed for the door , got in , and slammed the door closed . " Hurry , goddamnit , look over there ! " He pointed at the other side of the runway . More cars were heading their way . Sparks of machine-gun fire from someone leaning out of a window . In seconds Lochart was airborne , all senses concentrating on escape . Behind him some of the officers cheered , hung on as the chopper took evading action , and sorted themselves into seats . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat between Valik and the major . " I was n't sure it was you , General Excellency , " the major was saying , " so I fired high just as a warning . Praise be to God the plan worked so well . "  | " But you were going to take off . You were going to leave us ! You w  --  " " Oh , no , Excellency Uncle , " Valik interrupted smoothly , " it was the Britishpilot , he was panicking and did n't want to wait ! They 've no balls , Britishers ! Never mind him , " he added , " we 're armed , we 've food , and we 're safe ! Praise be to God ! And more praise that I had time to plan . " Yes , he thought , if it had n't been for me and my money we 'd all be dead  --  money to bribe the man who released us and you , and the major and captain to release Lochart whom I need just a little longer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " General Seladi was enraged , his face purple . " God curse that pilot to hell ! Why did you waste time releasing him ? Ali can fly a 212 ! " " Yes . But Lochart has more experience and we need him to get through the maze . " Valik smiled encouragingly at Annoush who sat across the aisle facing him , the little girl trembling in her arms , his son sitting on the floor dozing , his head in her lap . Weakly she smiled back , shifting the weight of the child to ease the aches that pervaded her . He reached over and touched her , then settled more comfortably in his seat and closed his eyes , very tired but most content . You 're a very clever man , he told himself . In his most secret heart he knew that without his stratagem of pretending to McIver that SAVAK was going to arrest him  --  and particularly his family  --  neither McIver nor Lochart would have helped them to escape . You measured them perfectly as you have Gavallan . Fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seladi , my stupid and rapacious uncle who bartered safe refueling at Isfahan  --  which you failed to provide  --  in return for a safe passageout for yourself and eleven of your friends , you 're worse . You 're a traitor . If I had n't had an informant of long standing in the General Staff HQ I would never have heard of the generals ' great betrayal in time to escape and we'd 've been caught like flies in a honey pot in Tehran . Loyalists may still prevail , the battle 's not lost yet , but meanwhile my family and I will watch events from England , St. Moritz , or New York . He let himself go into the exciting , wonderful power of the jets that were carrying them to safety , to a house in London , a country house in Surrey , another in California , and to Swiss and Bahamian bank accounts . Ah , yes , he told himself happily , and that reminds me about our blocked S-G joint accountin the Bahamas , another $4 million to enrich us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than enough to keep me and my family safe whatever happens here  --  until we can return . Khomeini wo n't live for/ever even if he wins -- God curse him ! Soon we 'll be able to return home , soon Iran will be normal again , meanwhile we have everything we need . His ears heard Seladi still muttering about Lochart and almost being left behind . " Calm yourself , Excellency , " he said , and took his arm , gentling him , and thought , You and your running dogs still have a value , a temporary value . Perhaps as hostages , perhaps as bait who knows ? None are family except you and you betrayed us . " Calm yourself , my revered uncle , with the Help of God the pilot will get what he deserves . " Yes . Lochart should not have panicked . He should have waited for my order . Disgusting to panic . Valik closed his eyes and slept , very satisfied with himself.  |p319AT  THE IRAN-TODA REFINERY , BANDAR DELAM : 12:04 P.M. Scragger was whistling tonelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were lined up in a small Japanese semi beside the freshly washed 206 , sparkling in the sun . Nearby was a young Green Band who squatted in the shade , leaning on his M16 , half asleep . The noonday sun was warm and the light breeze made the day pleasant and took away the constant humidity , here on the coast . Scragger was dressed lightly , white shirt with captain 's epaulets , summer-weight black trousers and shoes , the inevitable dark glasses and peaked cap . Now the tanks were brimming . " That 's it , me son , " he said to the Japaneseassigned to assist him . Hai , Anjin-san "  --  Yes , Mr. Pilot  --  the man said . Like all employees at the refinery he wore white , spotless overalls and gloves , with Iran-Toda Industriesp320emblazoned on the back , then the same thing in Farsi politely above , with equivalent in Japanese characters beneath it . " Hai , it is , " Scragger said , using one of the words that he had picked up from Kasigi en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our longrangetanks , and then we 'll fill the spares . " For the journey that de Plessey had grandly authorized Sunday night  --  to celebrate their victory over the saboteurs  --  Scragger had taken out the backseat and lashed in place two 40-gallon drums , " just in case , Mr. Kasigi . I 've connected them to the main tanks . We can use a hand pump and can even refuel in the air , if we have to  --  if you do the pumping . Now we wo n't have to land for fuel . You can never tell with weather in the Gulf , there 's always sudden storms or squalls , fog , winds can play tricks . Our best bet 's to stay a little out to sea . " " And Jaws ? " Scragger had laughed with him . " The old hammerhead of Kharg ? With any luck we might see him  --  if we get that far and do n't get diverted . " " Still no callback from Kish radar ? " " No , but it does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure you can refuel me at your plant ? " " Yes , we 've storage tanks , Captain . Helipads , hangar , and repair shop . Those were the first things we built  --  we had a contract with Guerney . " " Yes , yes , I knew about that , but they 've quit , have n't they ? " " Yes , they did , a week or so ago . Perhaps your company would take over the contract ? Perhaps you could be put in charge  --  there 's work for three 212s and perhaps two 206s constantly , while we 're building . " Scragger had chuckled . " That 'd make old Andy and Gav happy as a cat in a barrel of fish sticks and Dirty Dunc fart dust ! " " Please ? " Scragger tried to explain the joke about McIver . But when he was through Kasigi had not laughed , just said , Oh , now I understand . They 're a rum lot , Scragger thought . When he finished refueling he did another ground check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect to leave today . De Plessey had asked him to wait for Kasigi , to fly him where he needed to go , and to bring him back to Lengeh on Thursday . The 206 checked out perfectly . Satisfied he glanced at his watch , then he pointed at his stomach and rubbed it . " Grub time , hai ? " " Hai ! " His helper smiled and motioned to the small truck nearby , then pointed at the main , four-story office building two-hundred-odd yards away where the executive offices were . Scragger shook his head . " I 'll walk , " he said and waggled his two fingers to parody walking so the young man half bowed and got into the truck andp321drove off . He stood there for a moment , watching and being watched by the guard . Now that the truck had left and the tanks were closed , he could smell the sea and the rotting debris of the nearby shore . It was near low tide  --  there was only one tide a day in the Gulf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and landlocked but for the narrow Strait of Hormuz . He liked the sea smell . He had grown up in Sydney , always within sight of the sea . After the war he had settled there again . At least , he reminded himself , I was there between jobs and the Missus and the kids stayed there and still stay there , more or less . His son and two daughters were married now with children of their own . Whenever he was on home leave , perhaps once a year , he saw them . They had a friendly , distant relationship . In the early years his wife and children had come to the Gulf to settle . Within a month they had gone home to Sydney . " We 'll be at Bondi , Scrag , " she had said . " No more foreign places for us , lad . " During one of his two-year stints in Kuwait she had met another man . When Scragger had returned the next time , she said , " I think we 'll divorce , lad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " and so they did . Her new husband lived a few years , then died . Scragger and she drifted back into their pattern of friendliness  --  not that we ever left off , he thought . She 's a good sort and the kids 're happy and I 'm flying . He still sent her money monthly . She always said she did n't need it . " Then put it into savings against a rainy day , Nell , " he always told her . So far , touch wood , they 've not had rainy days , she and the kids and their kids . The nearest wood was the butt of the rifle the revolutionary had in his lap . The man was staring at him malevolently from the shade . Shitty bastard , you 're not going to spoil my day . He beamed at him , then turned his back , stretched , and looked around . This 's a great site for a refinery , he told himself , close enough to Abadan , to the main pipelines joining the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save all that gas being burned off , billions of tons of it all over the world . Criminal waste , when you think of it . The refinery was on a promontory , with its own dredged wharfing setup that stretched out into the Gulf for four hundred yards , that Kasigi had told him would eventually be able to handle two supertankers at the same time of whatever size could be built . Around the helipads were acres of complex cracking plants and buildings , all seemingly interconnected with miles of steel and plastic pipes of all sizes , mazes of them , with huge cocks and valves , pumping stations , and everywhere cranes and earthmovers and vast piles of all manner of construction materials , mountains of concrete and sand , reinforcingsteel mesh scattered around  --  along with neat dumps the size of football fields , of crates and containers protected with plastic tarpaulins  --  andp322half-finished roads , foundations , wharves , and excavations . But almost nothingmoving , neither men nor machines . When they had landed , a welcoming committee of twenty or thirty Japanesehad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred-odd Iranian strikers and armed Islamic Guards , some wearing IPLO armbands , the first Scragger had ever seen . After much shouting and threatening and examining their papers and the inbound Kish radar clearance , the spokesman had said the two of them could stay but no one could leave or the chopper take off without the komiteh 's permission . En route to the office building , Chief Engineer Watanabe , who could speak English , had explained that the strike komiteh had been , for all intents and purposes , in possession for almost two months . In that time almost no progress had been made and all work had ceased . " They wo n't even allow us to maintain our equipment . " He was a hard-faced , tough , grizzle-haired man in his sixties with very strong working hands . He lit another cigarette from his half-smoked one . " And your radio ? " " Six days ago they locked the radio room , forbidding its use and took away the key . Phones of course have been out for weeks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a thousand Japanese personnel here  --  dependents of course were never permitted  --  food supplies are very short , we 've had no mail for six weeks . We ca n't move out , we ca n't work . We 're almost prisoners and can do nothing without very great troubles indeed . However , at least we are alive to protect what we have done and wait patiently to be allowed to continue . We are very indeed honored to see you , Kasigi-san , and you , Cap-tain . " Scragger had left them to their business , feeling the tension between the two men , however much they tried to hide it . In the evening he had eaten lightly , as always , allowed himself one ice-cold Japanese beer , " Bugger me , it 's not as good as Foster 's , " then had done his eleven minutes of Canadian Air Force exercises and had gone to bed . Just before midnight while he was still reading , there had been a soft knock . Kasigi had come in excitedly , apologizing for disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had just heard a broadcast from a Khomeini spokesman in Tehran saying that all the armed services had declaredfor him , Prime Minister Bakhtiar had resigned , that now Iran was totally free of the Shah 's yoke , that by Khomeini 's personal order , all fighting should cease , all strikes should stop , oil production should commence again , all bazaars and shops should open , all men should hand in their weapons andp323return to work , and above everything , all should give thanks to God for granting them victory . Kasigi had beamed . " Now we can start again . Thank all gods , eh ? Now things will be normal again . " When Kasigi had left , Scragger had lain there , the light on , his mind racing over the possibilities of what would happen now . Stone the crows , he had thought , how fast everything 's been . I 'd 've bet heavy odds the Shah 'd never be shoved out , heavier odds that Khomeini 'd never be allowed back , and then my bundle on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just goes to show , Scrag , old chap . You know eff all . " In the morning he had awakened early , accepted Japanese green tea in place of the breakfast tea he usually drank  --  Indian , very strong , and always with condensed milk  --  and gone to check , clean , and refuel , and now , everythingtidy , he was very hungry . He nodded briefly to the guard who paid no attention to him and strolled off toward the four-story office building . Kasigi was standing at one of the windows on the top floor where the executive offices were . He was in the boardroom , a spacious corner office with a huge table and seats for twenty and had been watching the 206 and Scraggerabsently , his mind in turmoil , hard put to contain his rage . Since early this morning he had been going through cost projections , reports , accounts receivable , work projections , and so on , and they all added up to the same result : at least another billion dollars and another year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he had visited the refinery which was not in his sphere of responsibility though he was a director and member of the Chairman 's Executive Committee that was their conglomerate 's highest echelonof decision-making . Behind him Chief Engineer Watanabe sat alone at the vast table , outwardlypatient , chain-smoking as always . He had been in charge for the last two years , deputy chief since the project began in ' 71  --  a man of great experience . The previous chief engineer had died here , on-site , of a heart attack . No wonder , Kasigi thought angrily . Two years ago  --  perhaps four  --  it must have been quite clear to him our absolute maximum budget of $3.5 billion would be inadequate , that overruns were already vast and delivery dates totallyunrealistic . " Why did n't Chief Engineer Kasusaka inform us ? Why did n't he make a special report ? " " He did , Kasigi-san , " Watanabe said politely , " but by direction of the Head Agreements of the joint venture here , all reports have to go throughp324our court-appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always supposed to be a joint venture , fifty-fifty , with shared responsibilities , but gradually the Iranians manage to maneuver meetings and contracts and clauses , usually using the court or Shah as an excuse , till they have de facto control and then . . . " He shrugged . " You 've no idea how clever they are  --  worse than a Chinese merchant , much worse . They agree to buy the whole animal but renege and take only the steak and leave you with the rest of the carcass on your hands . " He put out the half-smoked cigarette and lit another . " There was a meeting of the whole board of partners with Gyokotomo-sama  --  Yoshi Gyokotomo himself , chairman of the Syndicate  --  here in this office , just before Chief Engineer Kasusaka-san died . I was present . Kasusaka-san cautioned everyone that Iranian bureaucratic delays and harassments  --  squeeze is the correct word  --  would put back production dates and cause a vast increase in cost overruns . I was present , I heard him with my own ears , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman everything would be rearranged , that Kasusaka-san did n't understand Iran or the way they did things in Iran . " Watanabe studied the end of his cigarette . " Kasusaka-san even said the same in private to Gyokotomo-sama , begging him to beware , and gave him a written detailed report . " Kasigi 's face closed . " Were you present at this meeting ? " " No  --  but he told me what he had said , that Gyokotomo-sama accepted the report and said that he himself would take it up to the highest level , in Tehran and at home in Japan . But nothing happened , Kasigi-san . Nothing . " " Where is the copy of the report ? " " There is n't one . The next day , before he left for Tehran , Gyokotomo ordered them destroyed . " Again the older man shrugged . " Chief Engineer Kasusaka 's job , and mine , was and is to get the refinery built , whatever the problems , and not to interfere with the working of the Syndicate . " Watanabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply , stubbed the other out delicately , wanting to smash it and the ashtray and the desk and the building and the plant to smithereens  --  along with this interloper Kasigi who dared to question him , who knew nothing , had never worked in Iran , and had his position in the company because he was kinsman to the Todas . " Unlike Chief Engineer Kasusaka " he added oh so gently , " over the years I have kept copies of my monthly reports . " " So ka ? " Kasigi said , trying to sound matter-of-fact . " Yes , " Watanabe said . And copies of these copies in a very safe place , he thought grimly in his most secret heart , taking a thick file from his briefcasep325and putting it on the desk , just in case you 'll try to make me responsible for the failures . " You may read them if you wish . " " Thank you . " With an effort Kasigi resisted the temptation to grab the file at once . Watanabe rubbed his face tiredly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting . " Once we 're back to normal , work will progress quickly . We are 80 percent complete . I 'm confident we can complete with the right planning  --  it 's all in my reports , including the matter of the Kasusaka meeting with the partners , and then with Gyokotomo-sama . " " What do you suggest as an overall solution to Iran-Toda ? " " There is n't one until we 're back to normal . " " We are now . You heard the broadcast . " " I heard it , Kasigi-san , but normal for me means when the Bazargan government'sin full control . " " That will happen within days . Your solution ? " " The solution is simple : get fresh partners who cooperate , arrange the financing we need , and within a year , less than a year , we 'll be producing . " " Can the partners be changed ? " Watanabe 's voice became as thin as his lips . " The old ones were all courtappointed , or approved , therefore Shah men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one since Khomeini returned , or heard from one . We 've heard rumors they 've all fled but . . . " Watanabe shrugged his great shoulders . " I 've no way of checking with no telex , no phones , no transport . I doubt if the new partners ' will be different in attitude . " Kasigi nodded and glanced back out the window , seeing nothing . Easy to blame Iranians and dead men and secret meetings and destroyed reports . Never had Chairman Yoshi Gyokotomo mentioned any meeting with Kasusaka or any written report . Why should Gyokotomo bury such a vital report ? Ridiculous because he and his company are equally at risk as ours . Why ? If Watanabe 's telling the truth and his own reports could prove it , why ? Then , for an instant that Watanabe noticed , Kasigi 's face fell to pieces as the answer came to him : because the immense overrun and management failure of the Iran-Toda complex , added to the disastrous slump in world shipping , will break Toda Shipping Industries , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Takeover by whom ? Of course by Yoshi Gyokotomo . Of course by that jumped-up peasant family who has hated us who are highborn , samurai-descended from ancient timThen again Kasigi felt as though his brain was going to explode : Of course by Yoshi Gyokotomo but aided and abetted of course by ourp326arch rivals , Mitsuwari Industries ! Oh , Gyokotomo 'll lose a fortune but they can sustain their portion of the loss while they grease the correct palms suggesting that they will jointly absorb Toda 's losses , dismember it , and with the benevolence of MITI put it under proper management . With the Todas will go their kinsmen : the Kasigis and the Kayamas . I might as well be dead . Oh ko ! And now I am the one who has to bring back the terrible news . Watanabe 's reports will prove nothing , for of course Gyokotomo will deny everything , damning me for trying to accuse him and will shout from the rooftops that the Watanabe reports prove conclusively Hiro Toda 's mismanagementfor years . So I 'm in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put me in the middle of this mess ! Perhaps he wants to replace me with one of his brothers or nephAt that moment there was a knock and the door burst open . Watanabe 's distraught young assistant came in hurriedly , apologizing profusely for disturbingthem . " Oh , so sorry , Watanabe-san , oh , yes , so sorr  --  " " What is it ? " Watanabe said , bringing him up short . " A komiteh is arriving in strength , Watanabe-san , Kasigi-sama ! Look ! " The white-faced young man pointed at the other windows that fronted the building . Kasigi was there first . In front of the main door was a truck filled with revolutionaries , other trucks and cars following . Men jumped out of them , began to collect in haphazard groups . Scragger was approaching and they saw him stop , then go on again toward the main door , but he was waved away as a big Mercedes drove up . Out of its back came a heavyset man in black robes and a black turban with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mustached , dressed in light clothes with an open-neck shirt . Both wore glasses . Watanabe sucked in his breath . " Who are they ? " Kasigi asked . " I do n't know , but an ayatollah means trouble . Mullahs wear white turbans , ayatollahs wear black . " Surrounded by half a dozen guards the two men strode into the building . " Bring them up here , Takeo , ceremoniously . " The young man rushed off at once . " We 've only had one visit by an ayatollah , last year , just after the Abadan fire . He called a meeting of all our Iranian staff , harangued them for three minutes , then in the name of Khomeini ordered them to strike . " His face settled into a mask . " That was he beginning of our trouble here  --  we expatriates have carried on as best we could ever since . " " What now ? " Kasigi asked . Watanabe shrugged , strode over to a bureau , and lifted up a framed photop327of Khomeini that Kasigi had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just for politeness , " he said with a sardonic smile . " Shall we sit down ? They expect formality from us  --  please take the head of the table . " " No , Watanabe-san . Please , you are in charge . I am only a visitor . " " As you wish . " Watanabe took his usual seat , and faced the door . Kasigi broke the silence . " What was that about the Abadan fire ? " " Ah , sorry , " Watanabe said apologetically , actually disgusted that Kasigi did not know about that most important event . " It was last August , during their holy month of Ramadan when no Believer may take food or drink from sunup to sunset and tempers are normally thin . At that time there was only a small amount of national protest against the Shah , mostly in Tehran and Qom , but nothing serious then and the clashes easily contained by police and SAVAK . On August fifteenth arsonists set fire to a movie house , the Rex Cinema in Abadan . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firemenand police happened ' to be slow arriving , and in the panic almost five hundred died , mostly women and children . " " How terrible ! " " Yes . The whole nation was outraged . Instantly SAVAK was blamed , and therefore the Shah , the Shah blamed leftists and swore the police and SAVAK had nothing to do with it . Of course he set up an inquiry which went on for weeks . Unfortunately it left the question of responsibility unresolved . " Watanabe was listening for the sound of footsteps . " That was the spark that united the warring opposing factions under Khomeini and tore the Pahlavis from their throne . " After a pause Kasigi said , " Who do you think set fire to the cinema ? " " Who wanted to destroy the Pahlavis ? So easy to cry SAVAK ! " Watanabe heard the elevator stop . " What 're five hundred women and children to a fanatic  --  of any persuasion ? " ' The door was opened by the assistant Takeo . The ayatollah and the civilianstrode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kasigi got up politely and bowed . " Welcome , " Watanabe said in Japanese though he could speak very good Farsi . " I am Naga Watanabe , in charge here , this is Mr. Kasigi from our head office in Japan . Whom do I have the pleasure of addressing please ? " ' Takeo , who could speak perfect Farsi , began to interpret but the civilian , who had already sat down , cut him short . " Vous parlez frangais ? " he said rudely to Watanabe. " lye ' - No  --  Watanabe said in Japanese . " Bien stir , m ' sieur , " Kasigi said hesitantly , his French mediocre . " Je **26;14398;TOOLONG father used the bathroom . She paused briefly ( as she now almost always did ) to look at her chest in the mirror , trying to decide if her breasts had gotten any bigger in the night . She had started getting them late last year . " There had been some faint pain at first , but that was gone now . They were extremely small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were there . It was true ; childhood would end ; she would be a woman . She smiled at her reflection and put a hand behind her head , pushing her hair up and sticking her chest out . She giggled a little girl 's unaffected giggle . . . and suddenly remembered the blood spewing out of the bathroom drain the night before . The giggles stopped abruptly . She looked at her arm and saw the bruise that had formed there in the night  --  an ugly stain between her shoulder and elbow , a stain with many discolored fingers . The toilet went with a bang and a flush . Moving quickly , not wanting him to be mad with her this morning ( not wanting him to even notice her this morning ) , Beverly pulled on a pair of jeans and her Derry High School sweatshirt . And then , because it could no longer be put off , she left her room for the bathroom . Her father passed her in the living room on his way back to his room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He grunted something at her she did n't understand . " Okay , Daddy , " she replied nevertheless . She stood in front of the closed bathroom door for a moment , trying to get her mind ready for what she might see inside . At least it 's daytime , she thought , and that brought some comfort . Not much , but some . She grasped the doorknob , turned it , and stepped inside . That was a busy morning for Beverly . She got her father his breakfast  --  orangejuice , scrambled eggs , Al Marsh 's version of toast ( the bread hot but not really toasted at all ) . He sat at the table , barricaded behind the News , and ate it all . " Where 's the bacon ? " " Gone , Daddy . We finished it yesterday . " " Cook me a hamburger . " " There 's only a little bit of that left , t  --  "  |p401The  paper rustled , then dropped . His blue stare fell on her like weight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said right away , Daddy . " He looked at her a moment longer . Then the paper went back up and Beverly hurried to the refrigerator to get the meat . She cooked him a hamburger , mashing the little bit of ground meat that was left in the icebox as hard as she could to make it look bigger . He ate it reading the Sports page and Beverly made his lunch  --  a couple of peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches , a big piece of cake her mother had brought back from Green 's Farm last night , a Thermos of hot coffee heavily laced with sugar . " You tell your mother I said to get this place cleaned up today , " he said , taking his dinnerbucket . " It looks like a damn old pigsty . Sam Hill ! I spend the whole day cleaning up messes over to the hospital . I do n't need to come home to a pigsty . You mind me , Beverly . " " Okay , Daddy . I will . " He kissed her cheek , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did , Beverly went to the window of her room and watched him walk down the street . And as she always did , she felt a sneaking sense of relief when he turned the corner . . . and hated herself for it . She did the dishes and then took the book she was reading out on the back steps for awhile . Lars Theramenius , his long blonde hair glowing with its own serene inner light , toddled over from the next building to show Beverly his new Tonka truck and the new scrapes on his knees . Beverly exclaimed over both . Then her mother was calling her . They changed both beds , washed the floors and waxed the kitchen linoleum . Her mother did the bathroom floor , for which Beverly was profoundly grateful . Elfrida Marsh was a small woman with graying hair and a grim look . Her lined face told the world that she had been around for awhile and intended to stay around awhile longer . . . . It also told the world that none of it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that state of affairs . " Will you do the living-room windows , Bevvie ? " she asked , coming back into the kitchen . She had changed into her waitress uniform . " I have to go up to Saint Joe 's in Bangor to see Cheryl Tarrent . She broke her leg last night . "  | " Yeah , I 'll do them , " Beverly said . " What happened to Mrs. Tarrent ? Did she fall down or something ? " Cheryl Tarrent was a woman Elfrida worked with at the restaurant . " She and that no-good she 's married to were in a car wreck , " Beverly 's mother said grimly . " He was drinking . You want to thank God in your prayers every night that your father does n't drink , Bevvic . " " I do , " Beverly said . She did . " She 's going to lose her job , I guess , and he ca n't hold one . " Now tones of grim horror crept into Elfrida 's voice . " They 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I t was the worst thing Elfrida Marsh could think of . Losing a child or finding out you had cancer did n't hold a candle to it . You could be poor ; you could spend your life doing what she called " scratchin . " But at the bottom of everything , below even the gutter , was a time when you might have to go on the county and drink the worksweat from the brows of others as a gift . This , she knew , was the prospect that now faced Cheryl Tarrent . " Once you got the windows washed and take the trash out , you can go and play awhile , if you want . It 's your father 's bowling night so you wo n't have to fix his supper , but I want you in before dark . You know why . " " Okay , Mom . " " My God , you 're growing up fast , " Elfrida said . She looked for a moment at the nubs in Beverly 's sweatshirt . Her glance was loving but pitiless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do around here once you 're married and have a place of your own . " " I 'll be around for just about ever , " Beverly said , smiling . Her mother hugged her briefly and kissed the corner of her mouth with her warm dry lips . " I know better , " she said . " But I love you , Bevvie . " " I love you too , Momma . " " You make sure there are n't any streaks on those windows when you 're done , " she said , picking up her purse and going to the door . " If there are , you 'll catch the blue devil from your father . " " I 'll be careful . " As her mother opened the door to go out , Beverly asked in a tone she hoped was casual : " Did you see anything funny in the bathroom , Mom ? " Elfrida looked back at her , frowning a little . " Funny ? "  | " Well . . . I saw a spider in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't Daddy tell you ? " " Did you get your dad angry at you last night , Bevvie ? " " No ! Huh-uh ! I told him a spider crawled out of the drain and scared me and he said sometimes they used to find drowned rats in the toilets at the old high school . Because of the drains . He did n't tell you about the spider I saw ? " " No . " " Oh . Well , it does n't matter . I just wondered if you saw it . " " I did n't see any spider . I wish we could afford a little new linoleum for that bathroom floor . " She glanced at the sky , which was blue and cloudless . " They say if you kill a spider , it brings rain . You did n't kill it , did you ? " " No , " Beverly said . " I did n't kill it . " Her mother looked back at her , her lips pressed together so tightly they almost were n't there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ? " " No ! " " Bevvie , does he ever touch you ? " " What ? " Beverly looked at her mother , totally perplexed . God , her father touched her every day . " I do n't get what you  --  " " Never mind , " Elfrida said shortly . " Do n't forget the trash . And if those windows are streaked , you wo n't need your father to give you blue devil . " " I won't ( does he ever touch you ) " forget . " " And be in before dark . " " I will . " ( does he ) ( worry an awful lot ) Elfrida left . Beverly went into her room again and watched her around the corner and out of view , as she had her father . Then , when she was sure her mother was well on her way to the bus stop , Beverly got the floorbucket , the Windex , and some rags from under the sink . She went into the living room and began on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the floor creaked or a door slammed , she jumped a little . When the Boltons ' toilet flushed above her , she uttered a gasp that was nearly a scream  |p404And  she kept looking toward the closed bathroom door . At last she walked down there and drew it open again and looked inside . Her mother had cleaned in here this morning , and most of the blood whit h had pooled under the sink was gone . So was the blood on the sink 's rim . But there were still maroon streaks drying in the sink itself , spots and splashes of it on the mirror and on the wallpaper . Beverly loked at her pale reflection and realized with sudden , superstitious dread that the blood on the mirror made it seem as if her face was bleeding . She thought again : What am I going to do about this ? Have I gone crazy ? Am I imagining it ? ' lie drain suddenly gave a burping chuckle . Beverly screamed and slammed the door and five minutes later her hands were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windex as she washed the windows in the living room . It was around three o'clock that afternoon , the apartment locked up and the extra key tucked snugly away in the pocket of her jeans , when Beverly Marsh happened to turn up Richard 's Alley , a narrow walk-through which connected Main and Center Streets , and came upon Ben Hanscom , Eddie Kaspbrak , and a boy named Bradley Donovan pitching pennies . " Hi , Bev ! " Eddie said . " You get any nightmares from those movies ? " " Nope , " Beverly said , squatting down to watch the game . " How 'd you know about that ? " " Haystack told me , " Eddie said , jerking a thumb at Ben , who was blushing wildly for no good reason Beverly could see . " What movieth ? " Bradley asked , and now Beverly recognized him : he had come down to the Barrens a week ago with Bill Denbrough . They had a speech class together in Bangor . Beverly more or less dismissed him from her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow less important than Ben and Eddie  --  less there . " Couple of creature features , " she said to him , and duck-walked closer until she was between Ben and Eddie . " You pitchin ? " " Yes , " Ben said . He looked at her quickly , then looked away.  | " Who 's winning ? " " Eddie , " Ben said . " Eddie 's real good . " She looked at Eddie , who polished his nails solemnly on the front of his shirt and then giggled . " Can I play ? " " Okay with me , " Eddie said . " You got pence ? " She felt in her pocket and brought out three . " Jeez , how do you dare to go out of the house with such a wad ? " Eddie asked . " I 'd be scared . " Ben and Bradley Donovan laughed . " Girls can be brave , too , " Beverly said gravely , and a moment later they were all laughing . Bradley pitched first , then Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasties . They tossed the pennies toward the back wall of the Center Street Drug Store . Sometimes they landed short , sometimes they struck and bounced back . At the end of each round the shooter with the penny closest to the wall collected all four pennies . Five minutes later , Beverly had twenty-four cents . She had lost only a single round . " Girlth cheat ! " Bradley said , disgusted , and got up to go . His good humor was gone , and he looked at Beverly with both anger and humiliation . " Girlth thould n't be allowed to  --  " Ben bounced to his feet . It was awesome to watch Ben Hanscom bounce . " Take that back ! " Bradley looked at Ben , his mouth open . " What ? " " Take it back ! She did n't cheat ! " Bradley looked from Ben to Eddie to Beverly , who was still on her knees . Then he looked back at Ben again . " You want a fat lip to math the reth of you , athhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grin suddenly crossed his face . Something in its quality caused Bradley to take a surprised , uneasy step backward . Perhaps what he saw in that grin was the simple fact that after tangling with Henry Bowers and coming out ahead not once but twice , Ben Hanscom was not about to be terrorized by skinny old Bradley Donovan ( who had warts all over his hands as well as that cataclysmic lisp ) . " Yeah , and then you all gang up on me , " Bradley said , taking another step backward . His voice had picked up an uncertain waver , and tears stood out in his eyes . " All a bunth of cheaterth ! "  | " You just take back what you said about her , " Ben said . " Never mind , Ben , " Beverly said . She held out a handful of coppers to Bradley . " " Take what 's yours . I was n't playing for keepsies anyway . Tears of humiliation spilled over Bradley 's lower lashes . He struck the pennies from Beverly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hard 's Alley . The others stood looking at him , open-mouthed . With safety within reach , Bradley turned around and shouted : " You 're jutht a little bith , that'th all ! Cheater ! Cheater ! Your mother'th a whore ! " Beverly gasped . Ben ran up the alley toward Bradley and succeeded in doing no more than tripping over an empty crate and falling down . Bradley was gone , and Ben knew better than to believe he could ever catch him . He turned toward Beverly instead to see if she was all right . That word had shocked him as much as it had her . She saw the concern in his face . She opened her mouth to say she was okay , not to worry , **65;14426;TOOLONG . . and that odd question her mother had asked ( does he ever touch you ) recurred . Odd question , yes  --  simple yet nonsensical , full of somehow ominous undertones , murky as old coffee . Instead of saying that names would never hurt her , she burst into tears . Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants pocket , and sucked on it . Then he bent down and began picking up the scattered pennies . There was a fussy , careful expression on his face as he did this . Ben moved toward her instinctively , wanting to hug and give comfort , and then stopped . She was too pretty . In the face of that prettiness he felt helpless . " Cheer up , " he said , knowing it must sound idiotic but unable to think of anything more useful . He touched her shoulders lightly ( she had put her hands over her face to hide her wet eyes and blotchy cheeks ) and then took them away as if she were too hot to touch . He was now blushing so hard he looked apoplectic . " Cheer up , Beverly . " She lowered her hands and cried out in a shrill , furious voice : " My mother is not a whore ! She . . . she 's a waitress ! "  |p407This  was greeted by absolute silence . Ben stared at her with his lower jaw sprung ajar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alley , his hands full of pennies . And suddenly all three of them were laughing hysterically . " A waitress ! " Eddie cackled . He had only the faintest idea of what a whore was , but something about this comparison struck him as delicious just the same . " Is that what she is ! " " Yes ! Yes , she is ! " Beverly gasped , laughing and crying at the same time . Ben was laughing so hard he could n't stand up . He sat heavily on a trashcan . His bulk drove the lid into the can and spilled him into the alley on his side . Eddie pointed at him and howled with laughter . Beverly helped him to his feet . A window went up above them and a woman yelled , " You kids get out of there ! There 's people that have to work the night shift , you know ! Get lost ! " Without thinking , the three of them linked hands , Beverly in the middle , and ran for Center Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered they had forty cents , enough for two ice-cream frappes from the drugstore . Because old Mr. Keene was a grouch and would n't let kids under twelve eat their stuff at the soda fountain ( he claimed the pinball machines in the back room might corrupt them ) , they took the frappes in two huge waxed containers up to Bassey Park and sat on the grass to drink them . Ben had coffee , Eddie strawberry . Beverly sat between the two boys with a straw , sampling each in turn like a bee at flowers . She felt okay again for the first time since the drain had coughed up its gout of blood the night before  --  washed out and emotionally exhausted , but okay , at peace with herself . For the time being , anyway . " I just do n't get what was wrong with Bradley , " Eddie said at last  --  it had the tone of awkward apology . " He never acted like that before . " " You stood up for me , " Beverly said , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p408Ben  went scarlet again . " You were n't cheating , " he mumbled , and abruptly gulped down half of his coffee frappe in three monster swallows . This was followed by a burp as loud as a shotgun blast . " Get any on you , Daddy-o ? " Eddie asked , and Beverly laughed helplessly , holding her stomach . " No more , " she giggled . " My stomach hurts . Please , no more . " lien was smiling . That night , before sleep , he would play the moment when she had kissed him over and over again in his mind . " Are you really okay now ? " he asked . She nodded . " It was n't him . It really was n't even what he said about my mother . It was something that happened last night . " She hesitated , looking from Ben to Eddie and back to Ben again . " I . . . I have to tell somebody . Or show somebody . Or something . I guess I cried because I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about , looneytunes ? " a new voice asked . It was Stanley Uris . As always he looked small , slim , and preternaturallyneat  --  much too neat for a kid who was just barely eleven . In his white shirt , neatly tucked into his fresh jeans all the way around , his hair combed , the toes of his high-top Keds spotlesslyclean , he looked instead like the world 's smallest adult . Then he smiled , and the illusion was broken . She wo n't say whatever she was going to say , Eddie thought , because he was n't there when Bradley called her mother that name . But after a moment 's hesitation , Beverly did tell . Because somehowStanley was different from Bradley  --  he was there in a way Bradley had not been . Stanley 's one of us , Beverly thought , and wondered why that should cause her arms to suddenly break out in bumps . I 'm not doing any of them any favors by telling , she thought . Not them , and not me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already speaking . Stan sat down with them , his face still and grave . Eddie offered him the last of the strawberry frappe and Stan only shook his head , his eyes never leaving Beverly 's face . None of the boys spoke . She told them about the voices . About recognizing Ronnie Grogan'svoice . She knew Ronnie was dead , but it was her voice all thesame . She told them about the blood , and how her father had notseen it or felt it , and how her mother had not seen it this morning . When she finished , she looked around at their faces , afraid ofp409what she might see there . . . but she saw no disbelief . Terror , but no disbelief . Finally Ben said , " Let 's go look . " They went in by the back door , not just because that was the lock Bev 's key fitted but because she said her father would kill her if Mrs. Bolton saw her going into the apartment with three boys while her folks were gone . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , numbnuts , " Stan said . " Just be quiet . " Eddie started to reply , looked again at Stan 's white , strained face and decided to keep his mouth shut . The door gave on the kitchen , which was full of late-afternoon sun and summer silence . The breakfast dishes sparkled in the drainer . The four of them stood by the kitchen table , bunched up , and when a door slammed upstairs , they all jumped and then laughed nervously . " Where is it ? " Ben asked . He was whispering . Her heart thudding in her temples , Beverly led them down the little hall with her parents ' bedroom on one side and the closed bathroom door at the end . She pulled it open , stepped quickly inside , and pulled the chain over the sink . Then she stepped back between Ben and Eddie again . The blood had dried to maroon smears on the mirror and the basin and the wallpaper . She looked at the blood because it was suddenly easier to look at that than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as her own , she asked : " Do you see it ? Do any of you see it ? Is it there ? " Ben stepped forward , and she was again struck by how delicately he moved for such a fat boy . He touched one of the smears of blood ; then a second ; then a long drip on the mirror . " Here . Here . Here . " His voice was flat and authoritative . " Jeepers ! It looks like somebody killed a pig in here , " Stan said , softly awed . " It all came out of the drain ? " Eddie asked . The sight of thep410blood made him feel ill . His breath was shortening . He clutched at his aspirator . Beverly had to struggle to keep from bursting into fresh tears . She did n't want to do that ; she was afraid if she did they would dismiss her as just another girl . But she had to clutch for the doorknobas relief washed through her in a wave of frightening strength . Until that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going crazy , having hallucinations , something . " And your mom and dad never saw it , " Ben marvelled . He touched a splotch of blood which had dried on the basin and then pulled his hand away and wiped it on the tail of his shirt . " Jeepers-creepers . " " I do n't know how I can ever come in here again , " Beverly said . " Not to wash up or brush my teeth or ... you know . " " Well , why do n't we clean the place up ? " Stanley asked suddenly . Beverly looked at him . " Clean it ? " " Sure . Maybe we could n't get all of it off the wallpaper  --  it looks sorta , you know , on its last legs  --  but we could get the rest . Have n't you got some rags ? " " Under the kitchen sink , " Beverly said . " But my mom 'll wonder where they went if we use them . " " I 've got fifty cents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had spattered the area of the bathroom around the washbasin . " We 'll clean up as good as we can , then take the rags down to that coin-op laundry place back the way we came . We 'll wash them and dry them and they 'll all be back under the sink before your folks get home . " " My mother says you ca n't get blood out of cloth , " Eddie objected . " She says it sets in , or something . " Ben uttered a hysterical little giggle . " Does n't matter if it comes out of the rags or not , " he said . " They ca n't see it . " No one had to ask him who he meant by " they . " " All right , " Beverly said . " Let 's try it . " For the next half hour , the four of them cleaned like grim elves , and as the blood disappeared from the walls and the mirror and thep411porcelain basin , Beverly felt her heart grow lighter and lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbed the floor . Stan worked on the wallpaper with studious care , using a rag that was almost dry . In the end , they got almost all of it . Ben finished by removing the light-bulb over the sink and replacing it with one from the box of bulbs in the pantry . There were plenty : Elfrida Marsh had bought a two-year supply from the Derry Lions during their annual light-bulb sale the fall before . They used Elfrida 's floorbucket , her Ajax , and plenty of hot water . They dumped the water frequently because none of them liked to have their hands in it once it had turned pink . At last Stanley backed away , looked at the bathroom with the critical eye of a boy in whom neatness and order are not simply ingrained but actually innate , and told them : " It 's the best we can do , I think . " There were still faint traces of blood on the wallpaper to the left of the sink , where the paper was so thin and ragged that Stanley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even here the blood had been sapped of its former ominous strength ; it was little more than a meaningless pastel smear . " Thank you , " Beverly said to all of them . She could not remember ever having meant thanks so deeply . " Thank you all . " " It 's okay , " Ben mumbled . He was of course blushing again . " Sure , " Eddie agreed . " Let 's get these rags done , " Stanley said . His face was set , almost stern . And later Beverly would think that perhaps only Stan realized that they had taken another step toward some unthinkable confrontation. 9They measured out a cup of Mrs. Marsh 's Tide and put it in an empty mayonnaise jar . Bev found a paper shopping bag to put the bloody rags in , and the four of them went down to the Kleen-Kloze Washateria on the corner of Main and Cony Streets . Two blocks farther up they could see the Canal gleaming a bright blue in the afternoon sun.  |p412The  Kleen-Kloze was empty except for a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dryer to stop . She glanced at the four kids distrustfully and then went back to her paperback of Peyton Place . " Cold water , " Ben said in a low voice . " My mom says you got ta wash blood in cold water . " They dumped the rags into the washer while Stan changed his two quarters for four dimes and two nickels . He came back and watched as Bev dumped the Tide over the rags and swung the washer 's door closed . Then he plugged two dimes into the coin-op slot and twisted the start knob . Beverly had chipped in most of the pennies she had won at pitch for the frappes , but she found four survivors deep down in the lefthand pocket of her jeans . She fished them out and offered them to Stan , who looked pained . " Jeez , " he said , " I take a girl on a laundry date and right away she wants to go Dutch . " Beverly laughed a little . " You sure ? " " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , it 's really breaking my heart to give up those four pence , Beverly , but I 'm sure . " The four of them went over to the line of plastic contour chairs against the Washateria 's cinderblock wall and sat there , not talking . The Maytag with the rags in it chugged and sloshed . Fans of suds 1 slobbered against the thick glass of its round porthole . At first the suds were reddish . Looking at them made Bev feel a little sick , but she found it was hard to look away . The bloody foam had a gruesome sort of fascination . The lady in the nurse 's uniform glanced at them more and more often over the top of her book . She had perhaps been afraid they would be rowdy ; now their very silence seemed to unnerve her . When her dryer stopped she took her clothes out , folded them , put them into a blue plastic laundry-bag and left , giving them one last puzzled look as she went out the door . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You 're not alone . " " What ? " Beverly asked . " You 're not alone , " Ben repeated . " You see  --  " He stopped and looked at Eddie , who nodded . He looked at Stan , who looked unhappy . . . but who , after a moment , shrugged and also nodded . " What in the world are you talking about ? " Beverly asked . She was tired of people saying inexplicable things to her today . Shep413gripped Ben 's lower arm . " If you know something about this , tell me ! " " Do you want to do it ? " Ben asked Eddie . Eddie shook his head . He took his aspirator out of his pocket and sucked in on it with a monstrous gasp . Speaking slowly , picking his words , Ben told Beverly how he had happened to meet Bill Denbrough and Eddie Kaspbrak in the Barrens on the day school let out  --  that was almost a week ago , as hard as that was to believe . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrens the following day . He told Bill 's story of how the school photograph of his dead brother had turned its head and winked . He told his own story of the mummy who had walked on the icy Canal in the dead heart of winter with balloons that floated against the wind . Beverly listened to all this with growing horror . She could feel her eyes widening , her hands and feet growingcold . Ben stopped and looked at Eddie . Eddie took another wheezing pull on his aspirator and then told the story of the leper again , speaking as rapidly as Ben had slowly , his words tumbling over one another in their urgency to escape and be gone . He finished with a sucking little half-sob , but this time he did n't cry . " And you ? " she asked , looking at Stan Uris . There was sudden silence , making them all start the way a sudden explosion might have done . " The wash is done , " Stan said . They watched him get up  --  small , economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the rags , which were stuck together in a clump , and examined them . " There 's a little stain left , " he said , " but it 's not too bad . Looks like it could be cranberry juice . " He showed them , and they all nodded gravely , as if over importantdocuments . Beverly felt a relief that was similar to the relief she had felt when the bathroom was clean again . She could stand the faded pastel smear on the peeling wallpaper in there , and she could stand the faint reddish stain on her mother 's cleaning rags . They had done something about it , that seemed to be the important thing . Maybe it had n't worked completely , but she discovered it had worked well enough to give her heart peace , and brother , that was good enough for Al Marsh 's daughter Beverly.  |p414Stan  tossed them into one of the barrel-shaped dryers and put in two nickels . The dryer started to turn , and Stan came back and took his seat between Eddie and Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , watching the rags turn and fall , turn and fall . The drone of the gas-fired dryer was soothing , almost soporific . A woman passed by the chockedopendoor , wheeling a cart of groceries . She glanced in at them and passed on . " I did see something , " Stan said suddenly . " I did n't want to talk about it , because I wanted to think it was a dream or something . Maybe even a fit , like that Stavier kid has . Any you guys know that kid ? " Ben and Bev shook their heads . Eddie said , " The kid who 's got epilepsy ? " " Yeah , right . That 's how bad it was . I would have rather thought I had something like that than that I saw something . . . really real . " " What was it ? " Bev asked , but she was n't sure she really wanted to know . This was not like listening to ghost-stories around a campfirewhile you ate wieners in toasted buns and cooked marshmallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here they sat in this stifling laundromat and she could see great big dust kitties under the washing machines ( ghost-turds , her father called them ) , she could see dust-motes dancing in the hot shafts of sunlight which fell through the laundromat 's dirty plate-glass window , she could see old magazines with their covers torn off . These were all normal things . Nice and normal and boring . But she was scared . Terribly scared . Because , she sensed , none of these things were made-up stories , made-up monsters : Ben 's mummy , Eddie 's leper . . . either or both of them might be out tonight when the sun went down . Or Bill Denbrough 's brother , one-armed and implacable , cruising through the black drains under the city with silver coins for eyes . Yet , when Stan did not answer immediately , she asked again : " What was it ? " Speaking carefully , Stan said : " I was over in that little park where the Standpipe is  --  " " Oh God , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's a haunted house in Derry , that 's it . " " What ? " Stan said sharply . " What did you say ? " " Do n't you know about that place ? " Eddie asked . " My mom would n't let me go near there even before the kids started gettingp415killed . She . . . she takes real good care of me . " He offered them an uneasy grin and held his aspirator tighter in his lap . " You see , some kids have been drowned in there . Three or four . They  --  Stan ? Stan , are you all right ? " Stan Uris 's face had gone a leaden gray . His mouth worked soundlessly . His eyes rolled up until the others could only see the bottommost curves of his irises . One hand clutched weakly at empty air and then fell against his thigh . Eddie did the only thing he could think of . He leaned over , put one thin arm around Stan 's slumping shoulders , jammed his aspiratorinto Stan 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cough and choke and gag . He sat up straight , his eyes back in focus again . He coughed into his cupped hands . At last he uttered a huge , burping gasp and slumped back against his chair . " What was that ? " he managed at last . " My asthma medicine , " Eddie said apologetically . " God , it tastes like dead dogshit . " They all laughed at this , but it was nervous laughter . The others were looking nervously at Stan . Thin color now burned in his cheeks . " It 's pretty bad , all right , " Eddie said with some pride . " Yeah , but is it kosher ? " Stan said , and they all laughed again , although none of them ( including Stan ) really knew what " kosher " meant . Stan stopped laughing first and looked at Eddie intently . " Tell me what you know about the Standpipe , " he said . Eddie started , but both Ben and Beverly also contributed . The Derry Standpipe stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of downtown , near the southern edge of the Barrens . At one time , near the end of the previous century , it had supplied all of Derry 's water , holding one and three-quarters million gallons . Becausethe circular open-air gallery just below the Standpipe 's roof offered a spectacular view of the town and the surrounding countryside , it had been a popular place until 1930 or so . Families would come out to tiny Memorial Park on a Saturday or Sunday forenoon when the weather was fine , climb the one hundred and sixty stairs inside the Standpipe to the gallery , and take in the view . More often than not they spread and ate a picnic lunch while they did so . The stairs were between the Standpipe 's outside , which was shingleda blinding white , and its inner sleeve , a great **27;14493;TOOLONG standing a hundred and six feet high . These stairs wound to the top in a narrow spiral . Just below the gallery level , a thick wooden door in the Standpipe'sinner jacket gave on a platform over the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked magnesium bulbs screwed into reflective tin hoods . The water was exactly one hundred feet deep when the supply was all the way up . " Where did the water come from ? " Ben asked . Bev , Eddie , and Stan looked at each other . None of them knew . " Well , what about the kids that drowned , then ? " They were only a bit clearer on that . It seemed that in those days ( " olden days , " Ben called them solemnly , as he took up this part of the tale ) the door leading to the platform over the water had always been left unlocked . One night a couple of kids . . . or maybe just one . . . or as many as three . . . had found the ground-level door also unlocked . They had gone up on a dare . They found their way out onto the platform over the water instead of onto the gallery by mistake . In the darkness , they had fallen over the edge before they quite knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid Vic Crumly who said he heard it from his dad , " Beverly said , " so maybe it 's true . Vic said his dad said that once they fell into the water they were as good as dead because there was nothing to hold onto . The platform was just out of reach . He said they paddled around in there , yelling for help , all night long , probably . Only no one heard them and they just got tireder and tireder until  --  " She trailed off , feeling the horror of it sink into her . She could see those boys in her mind 's eye , real or made-up , paddling around like drenched puppies . Going under , coming up sputtering . Splashingmore and swimming less as panic set in . Soggy sneakers treading water . Fingers scrabbling uselessly for any kind of purchase on the smooth steel walls of the sleeve . She could taste the water they must have swallowed . She could hear the flat , echoing quality of their cries . How long ? Fifteen minutes ? Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had simply floated face-down , strange fish for the caretaker to find the next morning ? " God , " Stan said dryly . " I heard there was a woman who lost her baby , too , " Eddie said suddenly . " That was when they closed the place for good . At least ,  |p417that  's what I heard . They did use to let people go up , I know that . But then one time there was this lady and her baby . I do n't know how old the baby was . But this platform , it 's supposed to go right out over the water . And the lady went to the railing and she was , you know , holding the baby , and either she dropped it or maybe it just wriggled . I heard this guy tried to save it . Doing the hero bit , you know . He jumped right in , but the baby was gone . Maybe he was wearing a jacket or something . When your clothes get wet , they drag you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought out a small brown glass bottle . He opened it , took out two white pills , and swallowed them dry . " What were those ? " Beverly asked . " Aspirin . I 've got a headache . " He looked at her defensively , but Beverly said nothing more . Ben finished . After the incident of the baby ( he himself , he said , had heard that it was actually a kid , a little girl of about three ) , the Town Council had voted to lock the Standpipe , both downstairs and up , and stop the daytrips and picnics on the gallery . It had remained locked from then until now . Oh , the caretaker came and went , and the maintenance men once in awhile , and once every season there were guided tours . Interested citizens could follow a lady from the Historical Society up the spiral of stairs to the gallery at the top , where they could ooh and aah over the view and snap Kodaks to show their friends . But the door to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still full of water ? " Stan asked . " I guess so , " Ben said . " I 've seen firetrucks filling up there during grassfire season . They hook a hose to the pipe at the bottom . " Stanley was looking at the dryer again , watching the rags go around and around . The clump had broken up now , and some of them floated like parachutes . " What did you see there ? " Bev asked him gently . For a moment it seemed he would not answer at all . Then he drew a deep , shuddering breath and said something that at first struck them all as being far from the point . " They named it MemorialPark after the 23rd Maine in the Civil War . The Derry Blues , they were called . There used to be a statue , but it blew down during a storm in the forties . They did n't have money enough to fix thep418statue , so they put in a birdbath instead . A big stone birdbath . " They were all looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his throat . " I watch birds , you see . I have an album , a pair of Zeiss-Ikon binoculars , and everything . " He looked at Eddie . " Do you have any more aspirins ? " Eddie handed him the bottle . Stan took two , hesitated , then took another . I le gave the bottle back and swallowed the pills , one after another , grimacing . Then he went on with his story . Stan 's encounter had happened on a rainy April evening two months ago . He had donned his slicker , put his bird-book and his binoculars in a waterproof sack with a drawstring at the top , and set out for Memorial Park . He and his father usually went out together , but his father had had to " work over " that night and had called specially at suppertime to talk to Stan . One of his customers at the agency , another birdwatcher , had spotted what he believed to be a male cardinal  --  Fringillidae Richmondena  --  drinkingfrom the birdbath in Memorial Park , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bathe right around dusk . It was very rare to spot a cardinal this far north of Massachusetts . Would Stan like to go down there and see if he could collect it ? He knew the weather was pretty foul , but .. . Stan had been agreeable . His mother made him promise to keep the hood of his slicker up , but Stan would have done that anyway . He was a fastidious boy . There were never any fights about getting him to wear his rubbers or his snowpants in the winter . He walked the mile and a half to Memorial Park in a rain so fine and hesitant that it really was n't even a drizzle ; it was more like a constant hanging mist . The air was muted but somehow exciting just the same . In spite of the last dwindling piles of snow under bushes and in groves of trees ( to Stan they looked like piles of dirty cast-off pillowcases ) , there was a smell of new growth in the air . Looking at the branches of elms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their silhouettes looked mysteriouslythicker . They would burst open in a week or two , unrolling leaves of a delicate , almost transparent green.  |p419The  air smells green tonight , he thought , and smiled a little . He walked quickly because the light would be gone in an hour or even less . He was as fastidious about his sightings as he was about his dress and study habits , and unless there was enough light left for him to be absolutely sure , he would not allow himself to collect the cardinal even if he knew in his heart he had really seen it . He cut across Memorial Park on a diagonal . The Standpipe was a white bulking shape to his left . Stan barely glanced at it . He had no interest whatsoever in the Standpipe . Memorial Park was a rough rectangle which sloped downhill . The grass ( white and dead at this time of year ) was kept neatly cut in the summertime , and there were circular beds of flowers . There was no playground equipment , however . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grade smoothed out before dropping abruptly down to Kansas Street and the Barrens beyond . The birdbath his father had mentioned stood on this flat area . It was a shallow stone dish set into a squat masonry pedestal that was really much too big for the humble function it fulfilled . Stan 's father had told him that , before the money ran out , they had intended to put the statue of the soldier back up here again . " I like the birdbath better , Daddy , " Stan said . Mr. Uris ruffled his hair . " Me too , son , " he said . " More baths and less bullets , that 's my motto . " At the top of this pedestal a motto had been carved in the stone . Stanley read it but did not understand it ; the only Latin he understoodwas the genus classifications of the birds in his book . Apparebat eidolon senex.  --  Plinythe inscription read . Stan sat down on a bench , took his bird-album out of the bag , and turned over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , familiarizing himself with the recognizable points . A male cardinal would be hard to mistake for something else  --  it was as red as a fire-engine , if not so large  --  but Stan was a creature of habit and convention ; these things comforted him and reinforced his sense of place and belonging in the world . So he gave the picturep420a good three-minute study before closing the book ( the moisture in the air was making the corners of the pages turn up ) and putting it back into the bag . Ile uncased his binoculars and put them to his eyes . There was no need to adjust the field of focus , because the last time he had used the glasses he had been sitting on this same bench and looking at that same birdbath . Fastidious boy , patient boy . He did not fidget . He did not get up and walk around or swing the binoculars here and there to see what else there might be to be seen . He sat still , field glasses trained on the birdbath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slic ker. 1 le was not bored . He was looking down into the equivalent of an avian convention-site . Four brown sparrows sat there for awhile , dipping into the water with their beaks , flicking droplets casually back over their shoulders and onto their backs . Then a bluejay came hauling in like a cop breaking up a gaggle of loiterers . The jay was as big as a house in Stan 's glasses , his quarrelsome cries absurdly thin by comparison ( after you looked through the binocularssteadily for awhile the magnified birds you saw began to seem not odd but perfectly correct ) . The sparrows flew off . The jay , now in charge , strutted , bathed , grew bored , departed . The sparrows returned , then flew off again as a pair of robins cruised in to bathe and ( perhaps ) to discuss matters of importance to the hollow-boned set . Stan 's father had laughed at Stan 's hesitant suggestion that maybe birds talked , and he was sure his dad was right when he said birds were n't smart enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by gosh they sure looked like they were talking . A new bird joined them . It was red . Stan hastily adjusted the field of focus on the binoculars a bit . Was it . . . ? No . It was a scarlet tanager , a good bird but not the cardinal he was looking for . It was joined by a flicker that was a frequent visitor to the Memorial Park birdbath . Stan recognized him by the tattered right wing . As always , he speculatedon how that might have happened  --  a close call with some cat seemed the most likely explanation . Other birds came and went . Stan saw a grackle , as clumsy and ugly as a flying boxcar , a bluebird , another flicker . He was finally rewarded by a new bird  --  not the cardinal but a cowbird that looked vast and stupid in the eyepieces of the binoculars . He dropped them against his chest and fumbled the bird-book out of the bag again , hoping that the cowbird would n't fly away before he could confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , at least . And it was time to go . The light was fading fast . He felt cold and damp . He checked the book , then looked through the glasses again . It was still there , not bathing but only standing on the rim of the birdbath looking dumb . It was almost surely a cowbird . With no distinctive markings  --  at least none he could pick up at this distance  --  and in the fading light it was hard to be one hundred percent sure , but maybe he had just enough time and light for one more check . He looked at the picture in the book , studying it with a fierce frown of concentration , and then picked up the glasses again . He had only fixed them on the birdbath when a hollow rolling boom ! sent the cowbird  --  if it had been a cowbird  --  winging . Stan tried to follow it with the glasses , knowing how slim his chances were of picking it up again . He lost it and made a hissing sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come once it would perhaps come again . And it had only been a cowbird ( probably a cowbird ) after all , not a golden eagle or a great auk . Stan recased his binoculars and put away his bird-album . Then he got up and looked around to see if he could tell what had been responsible for that sudden loud noise . It had n't sounded like a gun or a car backfire . More like a door being thrown open in a spooky movie about castles and dungeons . . . complete with hokey echo effects . He could see nothing . He got up and started toward the slope down to Kansas Street . The Standpipe was now on his right , a chalky white cylinder , phantomlikein the mist and the growing darkness . It seemed almost to . to float . That was an odd thought . He supposed it must have come from his own head  --  where else could a thought come from ?  --  but it somehow did not seem like his own thought at all . He looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without even thinking about it . Windows circled the building at intervals , rising around it in a spiral that made Stan think of the barber pole in front of Mr. Aurlette 's shop , where he and his dad got their haircuts . The bone-white shingles bulged out over each of those dark windows like brows over eyes . Wonder how they did that , Stan thought  --  not with as much interest as Ben Hanscom would have felt , but with some  --  and that was when he saw therep422was a much larger space of darkness at the foot of the Standpipe  --  a clear oblong in the circular base . He stopped , frowning , thinking that was a funny place for a window : it was completely out of symmetry with the others . Then he realized it was n't a window . It was a door . The noire I heard , he thought . It was that door , blowing open . Ile looked around . Early , gloomy dusk . White sky now fading to a dull dusky purple , mist thickening a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Dusk and mist and no wind at all . So ... if it had n't blown open , had someone pushed it open ? Why ? And it looked like an awfully heavy door to slam open hard enough to make a noise like that boom . He supposed a very big person . . . maybe .. . Curious , Stan walked over for a closer look . The door was bigger than he had first supposed  --  six feet high and two feet thick , the boards which composed it bound with brass strips . Stan swung it half-closed . It moved smoothly and easily on its hinges in spite of its size . It also moved silently  --  there was not a single squeak . He had moved it to see how much damage it had done to the shingles , blasting open like that . There was no damage at all ; not so much as a single mark . Weirdsville , as Richie would say . Well , it was n't the door you heard , that 's all , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Door was probably open all alHis foot struck something . Stan looked down and saw it was a padlock . . . correction . It was the remains of a padlock . It had been burst wide open . It looked , in fact , as if someone had rammed the lock 's keyway full of gunpowder and then set a match to it . Flowers of metal , deadly sharp , stood out from the body of the lock in a stiff spray . Stan could see the layers of steel inside . The thick hasp hung askew by one bolt which had been yanked three-quarters of the way out of the wood . The other three hasp-bolts lay on the wet grass . They had been twisted like pretzels . Frowning , Stan swung the door open again and peered inside . Narrow stairs led upward , circling around and out of sight . The outer wall of the staircase was bare wood supported by giant crossbeamswhich had been pegged together rather than nailed . To Stanp423some of the pegs looked thicker than his own upper arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelled like boils . " Is anyone here ? " Stan asked . There was no answer . He hesitated , then stepped inside so he could see up the narrow throat of the staircase a little better . Nothing . And it was Creep City in here . As Richie would also say . He turned to leave . . . and heard music . It was faint , but still instantly recognizable . Calliope music . He cocked his head , listening , the frown on his face starting to dissolve a little . Calliope music , all right , the music of carnivals and county fairs . It conjured up trace memories which were as delightful as they were ephemeral : popcorn , cotton candy , doughboys frying in hot grease , the chain-driven clatter of rides like the Wild Mouse , the Whip , the Koaster-Kups . Now the frown had become a tentative grin . Stan went up one step , then two more , head still cocked . He paused again . As if thinking about carnivals could actually create one ; he could now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doughboys . . . and more ! Peppers , chili-dogs , cigarette smoke and sawdust . There was the sharp smell of white vinegar , the kind you could shake over your french fries through a hole in the tin cap . He could smell mustard , bright yellow and stinging hot , that you spread on your hotdog with a wooden paddle . This was amazing . . . incredible . . . irresistible . He took another step up and that was when he heard the rustling , eager footsteps above him , descending the stairs . He cocked his head again . The calliope music had gotten suddenly louder , as if to mask the sound of the footsteps . He could recognize the tune now  --  it was " Camptown Races . " Footsteps , yeah : but they were n't exactly rustling footsteps , were they ? They actually sounded kind of . . . squishy , did n't they ? The sound was like people walking in rubbers full of water . Camptown ladies sing dis song , doodah doodah ( Squish-squish ) Camptown Racetrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now )  |p424Ride  around all night Ride around all day .. . Now there were shadows bobbing on the wall above him . The terror leaped down Stan 's throat all at once  --  it was like swallowing something hot and horrible , bad medicine that suddenly galvantzcd you like electricity . It was the shadows that did it . I le saw them only for a moment . He had just that small bit of t 11110 t , , ) ) hscrve that there were two of them , that they were slumped , and somehow unnatural . He had only that moment because the Ilk ; I , c cc here was fading , fading too fast , and as he turned , the heavy tic.ui ( pipe door swung ponderously shut behind him . Stanley ran back down the stairs ( somehow he had climbed more than a dozen , although he could only remember climbing two , three at most ) , very much afraid now . It was too dark in here to see anything . He could hear his own breathing , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing up there in the dark ? who 's playing it ? ) and he could hear those wet footsteps . Approaching him now . Getting closer . He hit the door with his hands splayed out in front of him , hit it hard enough to send sparkly tingles of pain all the way up to his elbows . It had swung so easily before . . . and now it would not move at all . No . . . that was not quite true . At first it had moved just a bit , just enough for him to see a mocking strip of gray light running vertically down its left side . Then gone again . As if someone was on the other side of it , holding the door closed . Panting , terrified , Stan pushed against the door with all of his strength . He could feel the brass bindings digging into his hands . Nothing . He whirled around , now pressing his back and his splayed hands against the door . He could feel sweat , oily and hot , running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It drifted and echoed down the spiral staircase . There was nothing cheery about it now . It had changed . It had become a dirge . It screamed like wind and water , and in his mind 's eye Stan saw a county fair at the end of autumn , wind and rain blowing up a deserted midway , pennons flapping , tents bulging , falling over , wheeling away likep425canvas bats . He saw empty rides standing against the sky like scaffolds ; the wind drummed and hooted in the weird angles of their struts . He suddenly understood that death was in this place with him , that death was coming for him out of the dark and he could not run . A sudden rush of water spilled down the stairs . Now it was not popcorn and doughboys and cotton candy he smelled but wet decay , the stench of dead pork which has exploded in a fury of maggots in a place hidden away from the sun . " Who 's here ? " he screamed in a high , trembling voice . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked with mud and old water . " The dead ones , Stanley . We 're the dead ones . We sank , but now we float . . . and you 'll float , too . " He could feel water washing around his feet . He cringed back against the door in an agony of fear . They were very close now . He could feel their nearness . He could smell them . Something was digging into his hip as he struck the door again and again in a mindless , useless effort to get away . " We 're dead , but sometimes we clown around a little , Stanley . Sometimes we  --  " It was his bird-book . Without thinking , Stan grabbed for it . It was stuck in his slicker pocket and would n't come out . One of them was down now ; he could hear it shuffling across the little stone areaway where he had come in . It would reach for him in a moment , and he would feel its cold flesh . He gave one more tremendous yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it in front of him like a puny shield , not thinking of what he was doing , but suddenly sure that this was right . " Robins ! " he screamed into the darkness , and for a moment the thing approaching ( it was surely less than five steps away now ) hesitated  --  he was almost sure it did . And for a moment had n't he felt some give in the door against which he was now cringing ? But he was n't cringing anymore . He was standing up straight in the darkness . When had that happened ? No time to wonder . Stan licked his dry lips and began to chant : " Robins ! Gray egrets ! Loons ! Scarlet tanagers ! Grackles ! Hammerhead woodpeckers ! Redheaded woodpeckers ! Chickadees ! Wrens ! Peli  --  "  |p426The  door opened with a protesting scream and Stan took a giant step backward into thin misty air . He fell sprawling on the dead grass . He had bent the bird-book nearly in half , and later that night he would see the dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had been bound in Play-Doh instead of hard pressboard. 1 lc did n't try to get up but began to dig in with his heels instead , his butt grooving through the slick grass . His lips were pulled back over his teeth . Inside that dim oblong he could see two sets of legs below the diagonal shadowline thrown by the door , which now stood half-open . He could see jeans that had decayed to a purplishblack . Orange threads lay plastered limply against the seams , and water dripped from the cuffs to puddle around shoes that had mostly rotted away , revealing swelled , purple toes within . Their hands lay limply at their sides , too long , too waxy-white . Depending from each finger was a small orange pompom . Holding his bent bird-book in front of him , his face wet with drizzle , sweat , and tears , Stan whispered in a husky monotone : " Chickenhawks . . . grosbeaks . . . hummingbirds ... albatrosses .. . kiwis ... " One of those hands turned over , showing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving something as idiotsmoothas the hand of a department-store dummy . One finger unrolled ... then rolled up again . The pompom bounced and dangled , dangled and bounced . It was beckoning him . Stan Uris , who would die in a bathtub with crosses slashed into his forearms twenty-seven years later , got to his knees , then to his feet , then ran . He ran across Kansas Street without looking either way for traffic and paused , panting , on the far sidewalk , to look back . From this angle he could n't see the door in the base of the Standpipe ; only the Standpipe itself , thick and yet somehow graceful , standing in the murk . " They were dead , " Stan whispered to himself , shocked . He wheeled suddenly and ran for home.  |p427The  dryer had stopped . So had Stan . The three others only looked at him for a long moment . 1 its skin was nearly as gray as the April evening of which he had just told them . " Wow , " Ben said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged , whistlingsigh . " It 's true , " Stan said in a low voice . " I swear to God it is . " " I believe you , " Beverly said . " After what happened at my house , I 'd believe anything . " She got up suddenly , almost knocking over her chair , and went to the dryer . She began to pull out the rags one by one , folding them . Her back was turned , but Ben suspected she was crying . He wanted to go to her and lacked the courage . " We got ta talk to Bill about this , " Eddie said . " Bill will know what to do . " " Do ? " Stan said , turning to look at him . " What do you mean , do ? " Eddie looked at him , uncomfortable . " Well ... " " I do n't want to do anything , " Stan said . He was looking at Eddie with such a hard , fierce stare that Eddie squirmed in his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I want to do . " " Not that easy , " Beverly said quietly , turning around . Ben had been right : the hot sunlight slanting in through the Washateria 's dirty windows reflected off bright lines of tears on her cheeks . " It 's not just us . I heard Ronnie Grogan . And the little boy I heard first . . . I think maybe it was that little Clements kid . The one who disappeared off his trike . " " So what ? " Stan said defiantly . " So what if it gets more ? " she asked . " What if it gets more kids ? " His eyes , a hot brown , locked with her blue ones , answering the question without speaking : So what if it does ? But Beverly did not look down or away and at last Stan dropped his own eyes . . perhaps only because she was still crying , but perhaps because her concern somehow made her stronger . " Eddie 's right , " she said . " We ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Right , " Stan said . If he was trying to sound contemptuous , it did n't work . His voice came out sounding only tired . " Dead kidsp428in the Standpipe . Blood that only kids can see , not grownups . Clowns walking on the Canal . Balloons that blow against the wind . Mummies . Lepers under porches . Chief Borton 'll laugh his bum off . . . and then stick us in the loonybin . " " If we all went to him , " Ben said , troubled . " If we all went together ... " " Sure , " Stan said . " Right . Tell me more , Haystack . Write me a book . " I le got up and went to the window , hands in pockets , looking angry and upset and scared . He stared out for a moment , shoulders stiff and rejecting beneath his neat shirt . Without turning back to them he repeated : " Write me a frigging book ! " " No , " Ben said quietly , " Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , surprised , and the others looked at him . There was a shocked look on Ben Hanscom 's face , as if he had suddenly and unexpectedly slapped himself . Bev folded the last of the rags . " Birds , " Eddie said . " What ? " Bev and Ben said together . Eddie was looking at Stan . " You got out by yelling birds ' names at them ? " " Maybe , " Stan said reluctantly . " Or maybe the door was just stuck and finally popped open . " " Without you leaning on it ? " Bev asked . Stan shrugged . It was not a sullen shrug ; it only said he did n't know . " I think it was the birds you shouted at them , " Eddie said . " But why ? In the movies you hold up a cross ... " ... or say the Lord 's Prayer . . . " Ben added. ... or the Twenty-third Psalm , " Beverly put in . " I know the Twenty-third Psalm , " Stan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old crucifix business . I 'm Jewish , remember ? " They looked away from him , embarrassed , either for his having been born that way or for their having forgotten it . " Birds , " Eddie said again . " Jesus ! " Then he glanced guiltily at Stan again , but Stan was looking moodily across the street at the Bangor Hydro office . " Bill will know what to do , " Ben said suddenly , as if finally agreeing with Bev and Eddie . " Betcha anything . Betcha any amount of money . " " Look , " Stan said , looking at all of them earnestly . " That 's okay.  |p429We  can talk to Bill about it if you want . But that 's where things stop for me . You can call me a chicken , or yellow , I do n't care . I 'm not a chicken , I do n't think . It 's just that those things in the Standpipe ... " " If you were n't afraid of something like that , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . " Yeah , I was scared , but that 's not the problem , " Stan said hotly . " It 's not even what I 'm talking about . Do n't you see  --  " They were looking at him expectantly , their eyes both troubled and faintly hopeful , but Stan found he could not explain how he felt . The words had run out . There was a brick of feeling inside him , almost choking him , and he could not get it out of his throat . Neat as he was , sure as he was , he was still only an eleven-year-old boy who had that year finished the fourth grade . He wanted to tell them that there were worse things than being frightened . You could be frightened by things like almost having a car hit you while you were riding your bike or , before the Salk vaccine , getting polio . You could be frightened of that crazyman Khrushchev or of drowning if you went out over your head . You could be frightened of all those things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to tell them that those dead boys who had lurched and shambled their way down the spiral staircase had done something worse than frighten him : they had offended him . Offended , yes . It was the only word he could think of , and if he used it they would laugh  --  they liked him , he knew that , and they had accepted him as one of them , but they would still laugh . All the same , there were things that were not supposed to be . They offended any sane person 's sense of order , they offended the central idea that God had given the earth a final tilt on its axis so that twilight would only last about twelve minutes at the equator and linger for an hour or more up where the Eskimos built their icecubehouses , that He had done that and He then had said , in effect : " Okay , if you can figure out the tilt , you can figure out any damn thing you choose . Because even light has weight , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doppler effect and when an airplane breaks the sound barrier that bang is n't the applauseof the angels or the flatulence of demons but only air collapsingback into place . I gave you the tilt and then I sat back about halfway up the auditorium to watch the show . I got nothing else top430say , except that two and two makes four , the lights in the sky are stars , if there 's blood grownups can see it as well as kids , and dead boys stay dead . " You can live with fear , I think , Stan would have said if he could . Maybe not forever , but for a long , long time . It 's offense you maybe ca n't live with , because it opens up a crack inside your thinking , and if you look down into it you see there are live things down there , and they have little yellow eyes that do n't blink , and there 's a stink down in that dark , and after awhile you think maybe there 's a whole other universe down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , and the stars laugh in cold voices , and some of the triangles have four sides , and some have five , and some of them have five raised to the fifth power of sides . In this universe there might grow roses which sing . Everything leads to everything , he would have told them if he could . Go to your church and listen to your stories about Jesus walking on the water , but if I saw a guy doing that I 'd scream and scream and scream . Because it would n't look like a miracle to me . It would look like an offense . Because he could say none of these things , he just reiterated : " Being scared is n't the problem . I just do n't want to be involved in something that will land me in the nuthatch . " " Will you at least go with us to talk to him ? " Bev asked . " Listen to what he says ? " " Sure , " Stan said , and then laughed . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed then , and it was a little easier . Beverly left them outside the Kleen-Kloze and took the rags back home by herself . The apartment was still empty . She put them under the kitchen sink and closed the cupboard . She stood up and looked down toward the bathroom . I 'm not going down there , she thought . I 'm going to watch Bandstand on TV . See if I ca n't learn how to do the Dog . So she went into the living room and turned on the TV and five minutes later she turned it off while Dick Clark was showing how much oil just one Stri-Dex medicated pad could take off the face of your average teenager ( " If you think you can get clean with justp431soap and water , " Dick said , holding the dirty pad up to the glassy eye of the camera so that every teenager in America could get a good look , " you ought to take a good look at this " ) . She went back to the kitchen cupboard over the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pocket tape , the kind that runs out a long yellow tongue of inches . She folded this into one cold hand and went down to the bathroom . It was sparkling clean , silent . Somewhere , far distant , it seemed , she could hear Mrs. Doyon yelling for her boy Jim to get in out of the road , right now . She went to the bathroom basin and looked down into the dark eye of the drain . She stood there for some time , her legs as cold as marble inside her jeans , her nipples feeling sharp enough and hard enough to cut paper , her lips dead dry . She waited for the voices . No voices came . A little shuddery sigh came from her , and she began to feed the thin steel tape into the drain . It went down smoothly  --  like a sword into the gullet of a county fair sideshow performer . Six inches , eight inches , ten . It stopped , bound up in the elbow-bend under the sink , Beverly supposed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually the tape began to feed into the drain again . Sixteen inches now , then two feet , then three . She watched the yellow tape slipping out of the chromed-steel case , which had been worn black on the sides by her father 's big hand . In her mind 's eye she saw it sliding through the black bore of the pipe , picking up some muck , scraping away flakes of rust . Down there where the sun never shines and the night never stops , she thought . She imagined the head of the tape , with its small steel buttplate no bigger than a fingernail , sliding farther and farther into the darkness , and part of her mind screamed What are you doing ? She did not ignore that voice . . . but she seemed helpless to heed it . She saw the end of the tape going straight down now , descending into the cellar . She saw it striking the sewage pipe . . . and even as she saw it , the tape bound up again . She wiggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be limber , made a faint eerie sound that reminded her a little bit of the way a saw sounds when you bend it back and forth across your legs.  |p432She  could see its rip wiggling against the bottom of this wider pipe , which would have a baked ceramic surface . She could see it bending ... and then she was able to push it forward again . She ran out six feet . Seven . NineAnd suddenly the tape began to run through her hands by itself , as if something down there was pulling the other end . Not just pulling it : running with it . She stared at the flowing tape , her eyes wide , her mouth a sagging 0 of fear  --  fear , yes , but no surprise . I Iad n't she known ? Had n't she known something like this was going to happen ? The tape ran out to its final stop . Eighteen feet ; an even six yards . A soft chuckle came wafting out of the drain , followed by a low whisper that was almost reproachful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't fight us . . . you 'll die if you try . . . die if you try . . . die i f you try . . . Beverly ... Beverly . . . Beverly . . . ly-ly-ly ... " Something clicked inside the tape-measure 's housing , and it suddenlybegan to run rapidly back into its case , the numbers and hashmarks blurring by . Near the end  --  the last five or six feet  --  the yellow became a dark , dripping red and she screamed and dropped it on the floor as if the tape had suddenly turned into a live snake . Fresh blood trickled over the clean white porcelain of the basin and back down into the drain 's wide eye . She bent , sobbing now , her fear a freezing weight in her stomach , and picked the tape up . She tweezed it between the thumb and first finger of her right hand and , holding it in front of her , took it into the kitchen . As she walked , blood dripped from the tape onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She steadied herself by thinking of what her father would say to her  --  what he would do to her  --  if he found that she had gotten his measuring tape all bloody . Of course , he would n't be able to see the blood , but it helped to think that . She took one of the clean rags  --  still as warm as fresh bread from the dryer  --  and went back into the bathroom . Before she began to clean , she put the hard rubber plug in the drain , closing that eye . The blood was fresh , and it cleaned up easily . She went up her own trail , wiping away the dime-sized drops on the linoleum , then rinsing the rag , wringing it out , and putting it aside . She got a second rag and used it to clean her father 's measuringp433tape . The blood was thick , viscous . In two places there were clots of the stuff , black and spongy . Although the blood only went back five or six feet , she cleaned the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pipemuck . That done , she put it back into the cupboard over the sink and took the two stained rags out in back of the apartment . Mrs. Doyon was yelling at Jim again . Her voice was clear , almost belllikein the still hot late afternoon . In the back yard , which was mostly bare dirt , weeds , and clotheslines , there was a rusty incinerator . Beverly threw the rags into it , then sat down on the back steps . Tears came suddenly , with surprisingviolence , and this time she made no effort to hold them back . She put her arms on her knees , her head in her arms , and wept while Mrs. Doyon called for Jim to come out of that road , did he want to get hit by a car and be killed ?  |p437Valentine  's DayTwo more disappearances in the past week  --  both children . Just as I was beginning to relax . One of them a sixteen-year-old boy named Dennis Torrio , the other a girl of just five who was sledding in back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her sled , one of those blue plastic flying saucers , but nothing else . There had been a fresh fall of snow the night before  --  four inches or so . No tracks but hers , Chief Rademacher said when I called him . He is becoming extremely annoyed with me , I think . Not anything that 's going to keep me awake nights ; I have worse things to do than that , do n't I ? Asked him if I could see the police photos . He refused . Asked him if her tracks led away toward any sort of drain or sewer grating . This was followed by a long period of silence . Then Rademacher said , " I 'm beginning to wonder if maybe you should n't see a doctor , Hanlon . The head-peeper kind of doctor . The kid was snatched by her father . Do n't you read the papers ? " " Was the Torrio boy snatched by his father ? " I asked . Another long pause . " Give it a rest , Hanlon , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up . Of course I read the papers  --  do n't I put them out in the Reading Room of the Public Library each morning myself ? The little girl ,  |p438Laurie  Ann Winterbarger , had been in the custody of her mother following an acrimonious divorce proceeding in the spring of 1982 . The police are operating on the theory that Horst Winterbarger , who is supposedly working as a machinery maintenance man somewhere in Florida , drove up to Maine to snatch his daughter . They further theorize that he parked his car beside the house and called to his daughter , who then joined him  --  hence the lack of any tracks other than the little girl 's . They have less to say about the fact that the girl had not seen her father since she was two . Part of the deep bitterness which accompanied the Winterbargers ' divorce came from Mrs. Winterbarger 's allegations that on at least two occasions Horst Winterbarger had sexually molested the child . She asked the court to deny Winterbarger all visitation rights , a request the court granted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court 's decision , which had the effect of cutting Winterbarger off completelyfrom his only child , may have pushed Winterbarger into taking his daughter . That at least has some dim plausibility , but ask yourself this : would little Laurie Ann have recognized him after three years and run to him when he called her ? Rademacher says yes , even though she was two the last time she saw him . I do n't think so . And her mother says Laurie Ann had been well trained about not approaching or talking to strangers , a lesson most Derry children learn early and well . Rademacher says he 's got Florida State Police looking for Winterbarger and that his responsibility ends there . " Matters of custody are more the province of the lawyers than that of the police , " this pompous , overweight asshole is quoted as saying in last Friday 's Derry News . But the Torrio boy . . . that 's something else . Wonderful home life . Played football for the Derry Tigers . Honor Roll student . Had gone through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed with flying colors . No history of drug use . Had a girlfriend that he was apparently head-over-heels about . Had everything to live for . Everything to stay in Derry for , at least for the next couple of years . All the same , he 's gone . What happened to him ? A sudden attack of wanderlust ? A drunk driver who maybe hit him , killed him , and buried him ? Or is he maybe still in Derry , is he maybe on the nightside of Derry , keepingp439company with folks like Betty Ripsom and Patrick Hockstetter and Eddie Corcoran and all the rest ? Is it(later)I 'm doing it again . Going over and over the same ground , doing nothing constructive , only cranking myself up to the screaming point . I jump when the iron stairs leading up to the stacks creak . I jump at shadows . I find myself wondering how I 'd react if I was shelving books up there in the stacks , pushing my little rubberwheeledtrolley in front of me , and a hand reached from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Had again a well-nigh insurmountable desire to begin calling them this afternoon . At one point I even got as far as dialing 404 , the Atlanta area code , with Stanley Uris 's number in front of me . Then I just held the phone against my ear , asking myself if I wanted to call them because I was really sure  --  one hundred percent sure  --  or simply because I 'm now so badly spooked that I ca n't stand to be alone ; that I have to talk to someone who knows ( or will know ) what it is I am spooked about . For a moment I could hear Richie saying Batches ? BATCHES ? We doan need no stinkin ' batches , senhorr ! in his Pancho Vanilla Voice , as clearly as if he were standing beside me . . . and I hung up the phone . Because when you want to see someone as badly as I wanted to see Richie  --  or any of them  --  at that moment , you just ca n't trust your own motivations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is , I 'm still not one hundred percent sure . If another body should turn up , I will call . . . but for now I must suppose that even such a pompous ass as Rademacher may be right . She could have remembered her father ; there may have been pictures of him . And I suppose a really persuasive adult could talk a kid into coming to his car , no matter what that child had been taught . There 's another fear that haunts me . Rademacher suggested that I might be going crazy . I do n't believe that , but if I call them now , they may think I 'm crazy . Worse than that , what if they should not remember me at all ? Mike Hanlon ? Who ? I do n't remember any Mike Hanlon . I do n't remember you at all . What promise ? I feel that there will come a right time to call them . . . and when that time comes , I 'll know that it 's right . Their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are two great wheels slowly coming into some sort of powerful convergence with each other , myself and the rest of berry on one , and all my childhood friends on the other . When the time comes , they will hear the voice of the Turtle . So I 'll wait , and sooner or later I 'll know . I do n't believe it 's a question anymore of calling them or not calling them . Only a question of when . February 20th , 1985The fire at the Black Spot . " A perfect example of how the Chamber of Commerce will try to rewrite history , Mike , " old Albert Carson would have told me , probably cackling as he said it . " They 'll try , and sometimes they almost succeed . . . but the old people remember how things really went . They always remember . And sometimes they 'll tell you , if you ask them right . " There are people who have lived in Derry for twenty years and do n't know that there was once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Air Corps Base , a barracks that was a good half a mile from the rest of the base  --  and in the middle of February , with the temperature standing right around zero and a forty-milean-hourwind howling across those flat runways and whopping the wind-chill factor down to something you could hardly believe , that extra half a mile became something that could give you frost-freeze or frostbite , or maybe even kill you . The other seven barracks had oil heat , storm windows , and insulation . They were toasty and cozy . The " special " barracks , which housed the twenty-seven men of Company E , was heated by a balky old wood furnace . Supplies of wood for it were catch-as-catch-can . The only insulation was the deep bank of pine and spruce boughs the men laid around the outside . One of the men promoted a complete set of storm windows for the place one day , but the twenty-seven inmates of the " special " barracks were detailed up to Bangor that same day to help with some work at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tired and cold , all of those windows had been broken . Every one . This was in 1930 , when half of America 's air force still consisted of biplanes . In Washington , Billy Mitchell had been courtmartialedp441and demoted to flying a desk because his gadfly insistence on trying to build a more modern air force had finally irritated his elders enough for them to slap him down hard . Not long after , he would resign . So there was precious little flying that went on at the Derry base , in spite of its three runways ( one of which was actually paved ) . Most of the soldiering that went on there was of the make-work variety . One of the Company E soldiers who returned to Derry after his service tour came to an end in 1937 was my dad . He told me this story : " One day in the spring of 1930  --  this was about six months before the fire at the Black Spot  --  I was coming back with four of my buddies from a three-day pass we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate there was this big old boy standing just inside the checkpoint , leaning on a shovel and picking the seat of his suntans out of his ass . A sergeant from someplace down south . Carroty-red hair . Bad teeth . Pimples . Not much more than an ape without the body hair , if you know what I mean . There were a lot of them like that in the army during the Depression . " So here we come , four young guys back from leave , all of us still feeling fine , and we could see in his eyes that he was just looking for something to bust us with . So we snapped him salutes as if he was General Black Jack Pershing himself . I guess we might have been all right , but it was one fine late-April day , sun shining down , and I had to shoot off my lip . A good afternoon to you , Sergeant Wilson , sir , ' said I , and he landed on me with both feet . " Did I give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nawsir , ' I say . " He looks around at the rest of them  --  Trevor Dawson , Carl Roone , and Henry Whitsun , who was killed in the fire that fall  --  and he says to them , This here smart nigger is in hack with me . If the rest of you jigaboos do n't want to join him in one hardworking dirty bitch of an afternoon , you get over to your barracks , stow your gear , and get your asses over to the O.D. You understand ? ' " Well , they got going , and Wilson hollers , Doubletime , you fuckers ! Lemme see the soles of your eighty-fucking-nines ! ' " So they doubletimed off , and Wilson took me over to one of the equipment sheds and he got me a spade . He took me out into the big field that used to be just about where the Northeast Airlines Airbus terminal stands today . And he looks at me , kind of grinning ,  |p442and  he points at the ground and he says , You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hole there , but I figured it was best for me to agree with whatever he said , so I looked down at the ground where he was pointing and said I sure did see it . So then he busted me one in the nose and knocked me over and there I was on the ground with blood running down over the last fresh shirt I had . " ' You do n't see it because some bigmouth jig bastard filled it up ! ' he shouted at me , and he had two big blotches of color on his c heck , . But he was grinning , too , and you could tell he was enjoying himself . ' So what you do , Mr. A Good Afternoon To You , what you do is you get the dirt out of my hole . Doubletime ! ' " So I dug for most two hours , and pretty soon I was in that hole up to my chin . The last couple of feet was clay , and by the time I finished I was standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through . " Get out of there , Hanlon , ' Sergeant Wilson said . He was sitting there on the grass , smoking a cigarette . He did n't offer me any help . I was dirt and muck from top to bottom , not to mention the blood drying on the blouse of my suntans . He stood up and walked over . He pointed at the hole . " What do you see there , nigger ? ' he asked me . " Your hole , Sergeant Wilson , ' says I. " Yeah , well , I decided I do n't want it , ' he says . I do n't want no hole dug by a nigger . Put my dirt back in , Private Hanlon . ' " So I filled it back in and by the time I was done the sun was going down and it was getting cold . He comes over and looks at it after I finished patting down the last of the dirt with the flat of the spade . " Now what do you see there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , ' I said , and he hit me again . My God , Mikey , I came this close to just bouncing up off'n the ground and splitting his head open with the edge of that shovel . But if I 'd done that , I never would have looked at the sky again , except through a set of bars . Still , there were times when I almost think it would have been worth it . I managed to hold my peace somehow , though . " That ai n't a bunch of dirt , you stupid coontail night-fighter ! ' he screams at me , the spit flying off'n his lips . That 's MY HOLE , and you best get the dirt out of it right now ! Doubletime ! ' " So I dug the dirt out of his hole and then I filled it in again ,  |p443and  then he asks me why I went and filled in his hole just when he was getting ready to take a crap in it . So I dug it out again and he drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole and he grins up at me while he 's doing his business and says , How you doin , Hanlon ? ' " I am doing just fine , sir , ' I says right back , because I had decided I was n't going to give up until I fell unconscious or dropped dead . I had my dander up . " Well , I aim to fix that , ' he says . To start with , you better just fill that hole in , Private Hanlon . And I want to see some life . You 're slowin down . ' " So I got her filled in again and I could see by the way he was grinning that he was only warming up . But just then this friend of his came humping across the field with a gas lantern and told him there 'd been a surprise inspection and Wilson was in hack for having missed it . My friends covered for me and I was okay , but Wilson 's friends  --  if that 's what he called them  --  could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I waited to see if his name would go up on the Punishment Roster the next day , but it never did . I guess he must have just told the Loot he missed the inspection because he was teaching a smartmouth nigger who it was owned all the holes at the Derry base  --  those that had already been dug and those that had n't been . They probably gave him a medal instead of potatoes to peel . And that 's how things were for Company E here in Derry . " It was right around 1958 that my father told me the story , and I guess he was pushing fifty , although my mother was only forty or so . I asked him if that was the way Derry was , why had he come back ? " Well , I was only sixteen when I joined the army , Mikey , " he said . " Lied about my age to get in . Was n't my idea , either . My mother told me to do it . I was big , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was born and grew up in Burgaw , North Carolina , and the only time we saw meat was right after the tobacco was in , or sometimes in the winter if my father shot a coon or a possum . The only good thing I remember about Burgaw is possum pie with hoecakes spread around her just as pretty as you could want . " So when my dad died in an accident with some farm machinery , my ma said she was going to take Philly Loubird up to Corinth , where she had people . Philly Loubird was the baby of the family . " " You mean my Uncle Phil ? " I asked , smiling to think of anybodyp444calling him Philly Loubird . He was a lawyer in Tucson , Arizona , and had been on the ( ; ity Council there for six years . When I was a kid , I thought Uncle Phil was rich . For a black man in 1958 , I suppose he was . Ile made twenty thousand dollars a year . " That 's who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days he was just a twelve-year-old kid who wore a ricepaper sailor hat and mended biballs and had no shoes . He was the youngest , I was the second youngest . All the others were gone  --  two dead , two married , one in jail . That was Howard . He never was any good . " ' You are goan join the army , ' your gramma Shirley told me . ' I du n no if they start paying you right away or not , but once they do , you 're goan send me a lotment every month . I hate to send you away , son , but if you do n't take care of me and Philly , I do n't know what 's going to become of us . ' She gave me my birth certificate to show the recruiter and I seen she fixed the year on it somehow to make me eighteen . " So I went to the courthouse where the army recruiter was and asked about joining up . He showed me the papers and the line where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name , ' I said , and he laughed like he did n't believe me . " ' Well then , you go on and write it , black boy , ' he says . " ' Hang on a minute , ' I says back . ' I want to ast you a couple of questions . ' " ' Fire away then , ' he says . ' I can answer anything you can ask . ' " ' Do they have meat twice a week in the army ? ' I asked . ' Mymamma says they do , but she is powerful set on me joining up . ' " ' No , they do n't have it twice a week , ' he says . " ' Well , that 's about what I thought , ' I says , thinking that the man surely does seem like a booger but at least he 's an honest booger . " Then he says , ' They got it ever night , ' making me wonder how I ever could have thought he was honest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I says . " ' You got that right , nigger , ' he says . " ' Well , if I join up , I got to do something for my mamma and Philly Loubird , ' I says . ' Mamma says it 's a lotment . ' " ' That 's this here , ' he says , and taps the allotment form . ' Now what else is on your mind ? ' " ' Well , ' says I , ' what about trainin to be an officer ? ' " He threw his head back when I said that and laughed until I thought he was gon na choke on his own spit . Then he says , ' Son ,  |p445the  day they got nigger officers in this man 's army will be the day you see the bleedin Jesus Christ doing the Charleston at Bird land . Now you sign or you do n't sign . I 'm out of patience . Also , you 're stinkin the place up . ' " So I signed , and watched him staple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the oath , and then I was a soldier . I was thinking that they 'd send me up to New Jersey , where the army was building bridges on account of there being no wars to fight . Instead , I got Derry , Maine , and Company E. " He sighed and shifted in his chair , a big man with white hair that curled close to his skull . At that time we had one of the bigger farms in Derry , and probably the best roadside produce stand south of Bangor . The three of us worked hard , and my father had to hire on extra help during harvesting time , and we made out . He said : " I came back because I 'd seen the South and I 'd seen the North , and there was the same hate in both places . It was n't Sergeant Wilson that convinced me of that . He was nothing but a Georgia cracker , and he took the South with him wherever he went . He did n't have to be south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , it was the fire at the Black Spot that convinced me of that . You know , Mikey , in a way ... " He glanced over at my mother , who was knitting . She had n't looked up , but I knew she was listening closely , and my father knew it too , I think . " In a way it was the fire made me a man . There was sixty people killed in that fire , eighteen of them from Company E. There really was n't any company left when that fire was over . Henry Whitsun ... Stork Anson ... Alan Snopes ... Everett McCaslin .. . Horton Sartoris . . . all my friends , all dead in that fire . And that fire was n't set by old Sarge Wilson and his grits-and-cornpone friends . It was set by the Derry branch of the Maine Legion of White Decency . Some of the kids you go to school with , son , their fathers struck the matches that lit the Black Spot on fire . And I 'm not talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daddy ? Why did they ? " " Well , part of it was just Derry , " my father said , frowning . He lit his pipe slowly and shook out the wooden match . " I do n't know why it happened here ; I ca n't explain it , but at the same time I ai n't surprised by it . " The Legion of White Decency was the Northerners ' version ofp446the Ku Klux Klan , you see . They marched in the same white sheets , they burned the same crosses , they wrote the same hate-notes to black folks they felt were getting above their station or taking jobs that were meant for white men . In churches where the preachers talked about black equality , they sometimes planted charges of dynamite . Most of the history books talk more about the KKK than they do about the Legion of White Decency , and a lot of people do n't even know there was such a thing . I think it might be because most of the histories have been written by Northerners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big cities and the manufacturin areas . New York , New Jersey , Detroit , Baltimore , Boston , Portsmouth  --  they all had their chapters . They tried to organize in Maine , but Derry was the only place they had any real success . Oh , for awhile there was a pretty good chapter in Lewiston  --  this was around the same time as the fire at the Black Spot  --  but they were n't worried about niggers raping white women or taking jobs that should have belonged to white men , because there were n't any niggers to speak of up here . In Lewiston they were worried about tramps and hobos and that something called the bonus army ' would join up with something they called the Communist riffraff army , ' by which they meant any man who was out of work . The Legion of Decency used to send these fellows out of town just as fast as they came in . Sometimes they stuffed poison ivy down the backs of their pants . Sometimes they set their shirts on fire . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire at the Black Spot . Things got out of hand , you see . The way things seem to do in this town , sometimes . " He paused , puffing . " It 's like the Legion of White Decency was just another seed , Mikey , and it found some earth that nourished it well here . It was a regular rich-man 's club . And after the fire , they all just laid away their sheets and lied each other up and it was papered over . " Now there was a kind of vicious contempt in his voice that made my mother look up , frowning . " After all , who got killed ? Eighteen army niggers , fourteen or fifteen town niggers , four members of a nigger jazz-band . . . and a bunch of nigger-lovers . What did it matter ? " " Will , " my mother said softly . " That 's enough . " " No , " I said . " I want to hear ! " " It 's getting to be your bedtime , Mikey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard hand . " I just want to tell you one thing more , and I do n't think you 'll understand it , because I 'm not sure I understand it myself . What happened that night at the Black Spot , bad as it was . . . I do n't really think it happened because we was black . Not even because the Spot was close behind West Broadway , where the rich whites in Derry lived then and still live today . I do n't think that the Legion of White Decency happened to get along so well here because they hated black people and bums more in Derry than they did in Portland or Lewiston or Brunswick . It 's because of that soil . It seems that bad things , hurtful things , do right well in the soil of this town . I 've thought so again and again over the years . I do n't know why it should be . . . but it is . " But there are good folks here too , and there were good folks here then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people turned out , and they turned out for the blacks as well as the whites . Businesses closed up for most of a week . The hospitals treated the hurt ones free of charge . There were food baskets and letters of condolence that were honestly meant . And there were helping hands held out . I met my friend Dewey Conroy during that time , and you know he 's just as white as vanilla ice cream , but I feel like he 's my brother . I 'd die for Dewey if he asked me to , and although no man really knows another man 's heart , I think he 'd die for me if it came to that . " Anyway , the army sent away those of us that were left after that fire , like they were ashamed . . . and I guess they were . I ended up down at Fort Hood , and I stayed there for six years . I met your mother there , and we were married in Galveston , at her folks ' house . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And after the war , I brought your mom back here . And we had you . And here we are , not three miles from where the Black Spot stood in 1930 . And I think it 's your bedtime , Mr. Man . " " I want to hear about the fire ! " I yelled . " Tell me about it , Daddy ! " And he looked at me in that frowning way that always shut me up . . . maybe because he did n't look that way often . Mostly he was a smiling man . " That 's no story for a boy , " he said . " Another time , Mikey . When we 've both walked around a few more years . " As it turned out , we both walked around another four years before I heard the story of what happened at the Black Spot that night , and by then my father 's walking days were all done . He toldp448me from the hospital bed where he lay , full of dope , dozing in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestines , eating him up . February 26th , 1985I got reading over what I had written last in this notebook and surprised myself by bursting into tears over my father , who has now been dead for twenty-three years . I can remember my grief for him  --  it lasted for almost two years . Then when I graduated from high school in 1965 and my mother looked at me and said , " 1 low proud your father would have been ! , " we cried in each other 's arms and I thought that was the end , that we had finished the job of burying him with those late tears . But who knows how long a grief may last ? Is n't it possible that , even thirty or forty years after the death of a child or a brother or a sister , one may half-waken , thinking of that person with that same lost emptiness , that feeling of places which may never be filled . . . perhaps not even in death ? He left the army in 1937 with a disability pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a good deal more warlike ; anyone with half an eye , he told me once , could see by then that soon all the guns would be coming out of storage again . He had risen to the rank of sergeant in the interim , and he had lost most of his left foot when a new recruit who was so scared he was almost shitting peach-pits pulled the pin on a hand grenade and then dropped it instead of throwing it . It rolled over to my father and exploded with a sound that was , he said , like a cough in the middle of the night . A lot of the ordnance those long-ago soldiers had to train with was either defective or had sat so long in almost forgotten supply depots that it was impotent . They had bullets that would n't fire and rifles that sometimes exploded in their hands when the bullets did fire . The navy had torpedoes that usually did n't go where they were aimed and did n't explode when they did . The Army Air Corps and the Navy Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , and at Pensacola in 1939 , I have read , a supply officer discovered a whole fleet of government trucks that would n't run becausecockroaches had eaten the rubber hoses and the fanbelts . So my father 's life was saved ( including , of course , the part of him that became Your Ob'dt Servant Michael Hanlon ) by a combination of bureaucratic porkbarrelling folderol and defectivep449equipment . The grenade only half-exploded and he just lost part of one foot instead of everything from the breastbone on down . Because of the disability money he was able to marry my mother a year earlier than he had planned . They did n't come to Derry at once ; they moved to Houston , where they did war work until 1945 . My father was a foreman in a factory that made bomb-casings . My mother was a Rosie the Riveter . But as he told me that night when I was eleven , the thought of Derry never escaped his mind . And now I wonder if that blind thing might not have been at work even then , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle in the Barrens that August evening . If the wheels of the universe are in true , then good always compensates for evil  --  but good can be awful as well . My father had a subscription to the Derry News . He kept his eye on the ads announcing land for sale . They had saved up a good bit of money . At last he saw a farm for sale that looked like a good proposition . . . on paper , at least . The two of them rode up from Texas on a Trailways bus , looked at it , and bought it the same day . The First Merchants of Penobscot County issued my father a tenyearmortgage , and they settled down . " We had some problems at first , " my father said another time . " There were people who did n't want Negroes in the neighborhood . We knew it was going to be that way  --  I had n't forgotten about the Black Spot  --  and we just hunkered down to wait it out . Kids would go by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty windows that first year . And some of them were n't just kids , either . One day when we got up , there was a swastika painted on the side of the chickenhouse and all the chickens were dead . Someone had poisoned their feed . Those were the last chickens I ever tried to keep . " But the County Sheriff  --  there was n't any police chief in those days , Derry was n't quite big enough for such a thing  --  got to work on the matter and he worked hard . That 's what I mean , Mikey , when I say there is good here as well as bad . It did n't make any difference to that man Sullivan that my skin was brown and my hair was kinky . He come out half a dozen times , he talked to people , and finally he found out who done it . And who do you think it was ? I 'll give you three guesses , and the first two do n't count ! " " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eyes . He tookp450a big white handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped them away . " Why , it was Butch Bowers , that 's who ! The father of the kid you say is the biggest bully at your school . The father 's a turd and the son 's a little fart . " " There are kids at school who say Henry 's father is crazy , " I told him . I think I was in the fourth grade at that time  --  far enough along to have had my can righteously kicked by Henry Bowers more than once , anyway . . . and now that I think about it , most of the pef ) rat ive terms for " black " or " Negro " I 've ever heard , I heard first f roni the lips of Henry Bowers , between grades one and four . " Well , I 'll tell you , " he said , " the idea that Butch Bowers is crazy might not be far wrong . People said he was never right after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Marines over there . Anyway , the Sheriff took him into custody and Butch was hollering that it was a put-up job and they were all just a bunch of niggerlovers . Oh , he was gon na sue everybody . I guess he had a list that would have stretched from here to Witcham Street . I doubt if he had a single pair of underdrawers that was whole in the seat , but he was going to sue me , Sheriff Sullivan , the Town of Derry , the County of Penobscot , and God alone knows who else . " As to what happened next . . . well , I ca n't swear it 's true , but this is how I heard it from Dewey Conroy . Dewey said the Sheriff went in to see Butch at the jail up in Bangor . And Sheriff Sullivan says , It 's time for you to shut your mouth and do some listening , Butch . That black guy , he do n't want to press charges . He do n't want to send you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He figures two hundred dollars would do her . ' " Butch tells the Sheriff he can put his two hundred dollars where the sun do n't shine , and Sheriff Sullivan , he tells Butch : They got a lime pit down at the Shank , Butch , and they tell me after you 've been workin there about two years , your tongue goes as green as a lime Popsicle . Now you pick . Two years peelin lime or two hundred dollars . What do you think ? ' " No jury in Maine will convict me , ' Butch says , not for killing a nigger 's chickens . ' " I know that , ' Sullivan says . " Then what the Christ are we chinnin about ? ' Butch asks him . " You better wake up , Butch . They wo n't put you away for thee hickens , but they will put you away for the swastiker you paintednnrt the door after you killed em . '  | " Well , Dewey said Butch 's mouth just kind of dropped open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About three days later Butch told his brother , the one that froze to death couple of years after while out hunting drunk , to sell his new Mercury , which Butch had bought with his muster-out pay and was mighty sweet on . So I got my two hundred dollars and Butch swore he was going to burn me out . He went around telling all his friends that . So I caught up with him one afternoon . He 'd bought an old pre-war Ford to replace the Merc , and I had my pick-up . I cut him off out on Witcham Street by the trainyards and got out with my Winchesterrifle . " Any fires out my way and you got one bad black man gunning for you , old floss , ' I told him . " You ca n't talk to me that way , nigger , ' he said , and he was damn near to blubbering between bein mad and bein scared . You ca n't talk to no white man that way , not a jig like you . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mikey . And I knew if I did n't scare him off for good right then I 'd never be shed of him . There was n't nobody around . I reached in that Ford with one hand and caught him by the hair of the head . I put the stock of my rifle against the buckle of my belt and got the muzzle right up under his chin . I said , The next time you call me a nigger or a jig , your brains are going to be dripping off the domelight of your car . And you believe me , Butch : any fires out my way and I 'm gunning for you . I may come gunning for your wife and your brat and your nocountbrother as well . I have had enough . ' " Then he did start to cry , and I never saw an uglier sight in my life . Look what things has come to here , ' he says , when a nih . . . when a jih . . . when a feller can put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the road . ' " Yeah , the world must be going to a camp-meeting hell when something like that can happen , ' I agreed . But that do n't matter now . All that matters now is , do we have an understanding here or do you want to see if you can learn how to breathe through your forehead ? ' " He allowed as how we had an understanding , and that was the last bit of trouble I ever had with Butch Bowers , except for maybe when your dog Mr. Chips died , and I 've got no proof that was Bowers 's doing . Chippy might have just got a poison bait or something.  | " Since that day we 've been pretty much left alone to make our way , and when I look hack on it , there ai n't much I regret . We 've had a good life here , and if there are nights when I dream about that fire , well , there is n't nobody that can live a natural life without having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been days since I sat down to write the story of the fire at the Black Spot as my father told it to me , and I have n't gotten to it yet . It 's in The Lord of the Rings , I think , where one of the characters says that " way leads on to way " ; that you could start at a path leading nowhere more fantastic than from your own front steps to the sidewalk , and from there you could go . . . well , anywhere at all . It 's the same way with stories . One leads to the next , to the next , and to the next ; maybe they go in the direction you wanted to go , but maybe they do n't . Maybe in the end it 's the voice that tells the stories more than the stories themselves that matters . It 's his voice that I remember , certainly : my father 's voice , low and slow , how he would chuckle sometimes or laugh outright . The pauses to light his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of Narragansett ( Nasty Gansett , he called it ) from the icebox . That voice , which is for me somehow the voice of all voices , the voice of all years , the ultimate voice of this place  --  one that 's in none of the Ives interviews nor in any of the poor histories of this place . . . nor on any of my own tapes . My father 's voice . Now it 's ten o'clock , the library closed an hour ago , and a proper old jeezer is starting to crank up outside . I can hear tiny spicules of sleet striking the windows in here and in the glassed-in corridor which leads to the Children 's Library . I can hear other sounds , too  --  stealthy creaks and bumps outside the circle of light where I sit , writing on the lined yellow pages of a legal pad . Just the sounds of an old building settling , I tell myself . . . but I wonder . As I wonder if somewhere out in this storm there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . I think I 've finally found my way to my father 's final story . I heard it in his hospital room no more than six weeks before he died . I went to see him with my mother every afternoon after school ,  |p453and  alone every evening . My mother had to stay home and do the chores then , but she insisted that I go . I rode my bike . She would n't let me hook rides , not even four years after the murders had ended . That was a hard six weeks for a boy who was only fifteen . I loved my father , but I came to hate those evening visits  --  watching him shrink and shrivel , watching the pain-lines spread and deepen on his face . Sometimes he would cry , although he tried not to . And going home it would be getting dark and I would think back to the summer of ' 58 , and I 'd be afraid to look behind me because the clown might be there . . . or the werewolf . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was mostly afraid that no matter what shape It took , It would have my father 's cancer-raddled face . So I would pedal as fast as I could no matter how hard my heart thundered in my chest and come in flushed and sweaty-haired and out of breath and my mother would say , " Why do you want to ride so fast , Mikey ? You 'll make yourself sick . " And I 'd say , " I wanted to get back in time to help you with the chores , " and she 'd give me a hug and a kiss and tell me I was a good boy . As time went on , it got so I could hardly think of things to talk about with him anymore . Riding into town , I 'd rack my brain for subjects of conversation , dreading the moment when both of us would run out of things to say . His dying scared me and enraged me , but it embarrassed me , too ; it seemed to me then and it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a quick thing . The cancer was doing more than killing him . It was degrading him , demeaning him . We never spoke of the cancer , and in some of those silences I thought that we must speak of it , that there would be nothing else and we would be stuck with it like kids caught without a place to sit in a game of musical chairs when the piano stops , and I would become almost frantic , trying to think of something  --  anything !  --  to say so that we would not have to acknowledge the thing which was now destroying my daddy , who had once taken Butch Bowers by the hair and jammed his rifle into the shelf of his chin and demanded of Butch to be left alone . We would be forced to speak of it , and if we were I would cry . I would n't be able to help it . And at fifteen , I think the thought of crying in front of my father scared and distressed me more than anything else . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him again about the fire at the Black Spot . They 'd filled him fullp454of dope that evening because the pain was very bad , and he had been drifting in and out of consciousness , sometimes speaking clearly , sometimes speaking in that exotic language I think of as Sleepmud . Sometimes I knew he was talking to me , but at other times he seemed to have me confused with his brother Phil . I asked him about the Black Spot for no real reason ; it had just jumped into my mind and I seized on it . His eyes sharpened and he smiled a little . " You ai n't never forgot that , have you , Mikey ? " " No , sir , " I said , and although I had n't thought about it in three years or better , I added what he sometimes said : " It has n't ever escaped my mind . " " Well , I 'll tell you now , " he said . " Fifteen is old enough , I guess , and your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to know . I think something like it could only have happened in Derry , and you need to know that , too . So you can beware . The conditions for such things have always seemed right here . You 're careful , are n't you , Mikey ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . " Good , " he said , and his head dropped back on his pillow . " That 's good . " I thought he was going to drift off again  --  his eyes had slipped closed  --  but instead he began to talk . " When I was at the army base here in ' 29 and ' 30 , " he said , " there was an NCO Club up there on the hill , where Derry Community College is now . It was right behind the PX , where you used to be able to get a pack of Lucky Strike Greens for seven cents . The NCO Club was only a big old quonset hut , but they had fixed it up nice inside  --  carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jukebox  --  andyou could get soft drinks on the weekend . . . if you were white , that was . They would have bands in most Saturday nights , and it was quite a place to go . It was just pop over the bar , it being Prohibition , but we heard you could get stronger stuff if you wanted it . . . and if you had a little green star on your army card . That was like a secret sign they had . Home-brew beer mostly , but on weekendsyou could sometimes get stronger stuff . If you were white . " Us Company E boys were n't allowed any place near it , of course . So we went on the town if we had a pass in the evening . In those days Derry was still something of a logging town and there were eight or ten bars , most of em down in a part of town they called Hell 's Half-Acre . They was n't speakeasies ; that was too grand ap455name for em . Was n't anybody in em spoke very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs , ' and that was about right , because most of the customers acted like pigs when they were in there and they was about blind when they turned em out . The Sheriff knew and the cops knew , but those places roared all night long , same as they 'd done since the logging days in the 1890s . I suppose palms got greased , but maybe not as many or with so much as you might think ; in Derry people have a way of looking the other way . Some served hard stuff as well as beer , and by all accounts I ever heard , the stuff you could get in town was ten times as good as the rotgut whiskey and bathtub gin you could get at the white boys ' NCO on Friday and Saturday nights . The downtown hooch came over the border from Canada in pulp trucks , and most of them bottles had what the labels said . The good stuff was expensive , but there was plenty of furnace-oil too , and it might hang you over but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind , it did n't last . On any given night you 'd have to duck your head when the bottles came flying by . There was Nan 's , the Paradise , Wally 's Spa , the Silver Dollar , and one bar , the Powderhorn , where you could sometimes get a whore . Oh , you could pick up a woman at any pig , you did n't even have to work at it that hard  --  there was a lot of them wanted to find out if a slice off'n the rye loaf was any different  --  but to kids like me and Trevor Dawson and Carl Roone , my friends in those days , the thought of buying a whore  --  a white whore  --  that was something you had to sit down and consider . " As I 've told you , he was heavily doped that night . I do n't believe he would have said any of that stuff  --  not to his fifteen-year-old son  --  if he had not been . " Well , it was n't very long before a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Fuller . He said he wanted to talk about some problems between the townspeople and the enlisted men ' and concerns of the electorate ' and questions of propriety , ' but what he really wanted Fuller to know was as clear as a windowpane . They did n't want no army niggers in their pigs , botherin white women and drinkin illegal hooch at a bar where only white men was supposed to be standin and drinkin illegal hooch . " All of which was a laugh , all right . The flower of white womanhoodthey were so worried about was mostly a bunch of barbags , and as far as getting in the way of the men . . . ! Well , all I can sayp456is that I never saw a member of the Derry Town Council down in the Silver Dollar , or in the Powderhorn . The men who drank in those dives were pulp-cutters in those big red-and-black-checked lumberman 's jackets , scars and scabs all over their hands , some of em missing eyes or fingers , all of em missing most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawdust and sap . They wore green flannel pants and green gumrubber boots and tracked snow across the floor until it was black with it . They smelled big , Mikey , and they walked big , and they talked big . They were big . I was in W ally 's Spa one night when I saw a fella split his shirt right down one arm while he was armrassling this other fella . It did n't just rip  --  you probably think that 's what I mean , but it ai n't . Arm of that man 's shirt damn near exploded  --  sort of blew off his arm , in rags . And everybody cheered and applauded and somebody slapped me on the back and said , That 's what you call an armrassler 's fart , blackface . ' " What I 'm telling you is that if the men who used those blind pigs on Friday and Saturday nights when they come out of the woods to drink whiskey and fuck women instead of knotholes greased up with lard , if those men had n't wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our asses . But the fact of it was , Mikey , they did n't seem to give much of a toot one way or the other . " One of em took me aside one night  --  he was six foot , which was damn big for those days , and he was dead drunk , and he smelled as high as a basket of month-old peaches . If he 'd stepped out of his clothes , I think they would have stood up alone . He looks at me and says , Mister , I gon na ast you sumpin , me . Are you be a Negro ? ' " That 's right , ' I says . " Commen ' ca vat ' he says in the Saint John Valley French that sounds almost like Cajun talk , and grins so big I saw all four of his teeth . I knew you was , me ! Hey ! I seen one in a book once ! Had the same  --  ' and he could n't think how to say what was on his mind , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big lips , ' I says . " Yeah , yeah ! ' he says , laughin like a kid . Beeg leeps ! Epais levres ! Beeg leeps ! Gon na buy you a beer , me ! ' " Buy away , ' I says , not wanting to get on his bad side . " He laughed at that too and clapped me on the back  --  almost knocking me on my face  --  and pushed his way up to the plankwoodp457bar where there must have been seventy men and maybe fifteen women lined up . I need two beers fore I tear this dump apart ! ' he yells at the bartender , who was a big lug with a broken nose named Romeo Dupree . One for me and one pour l'homme avec les epai.t levres ! ' And they all laughed like hell at that , but not in a mean way , Mikey . " So he gets the beers and gives me mine and he says , What 's your name ? I do n't want to call you Beeg Leeps , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I says . " Well , here 's to you , Weelyum Anton , ' he says . " No , here 's to you , ' I says . You 're the first white man who ever bought me a drink . ' Which was true . " So we drank those beers down and then we had two more and he says , You sure you 're a Negro ? Except for them epais leeps , you look just like a white man with brown skin to me . ' " My father got to laughing at this , and so did I. He laughed so hard his stomach started to hurt him , and he held it , grimacing , his eyes turned up , his upper plate biting down on his lower lip . " You want me to ring for the nurse , Daddy ? " I asked , alarmed . " No ... no . I 'm goan be okay . The worst thing of this , Mikey , is that you ca n't even laugh anymore when you feel like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments , and I realize now that that was the only time we came close to talking about what was killing him . Maybe it would have been better  --  better for both of us  --  if we had done more . He took a sip of water and then went on . " Anyway , it was n't the few women who travelled the pigs , and it was n't the lumberjacks that made up their main custom who wanted us out . It was those five old men on the Town Council who were really offended , them and the dozen or so men that stood behind them  --  Derry 's old line , you know . None of them had ever stepped a foot inside of the Paradise or Wally 's Spa , they did their boozing at the country club which then stood over on Derry Heights , but they wanted to make sure that none of those barbags or peaveyswingersgot polluted by the blacks of Company E. " So Major Fuller says , I never wanted them here in the first place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent back down south or maybe to New Jersey . '  | " That 's not my problem , ' this old fart tells him . Mueller , I think his name was  --  " " Sally Mueller 's father ? " I asked , startled . Sally Mueller was in the same high-school class with me . My father grinned a sour , crooked little grin . " No , this would have been her uncle . Sally Mueller 's dad was off in college somewherethen . But if he 'd been in Derry , he would have been there , I guess , standing with his brother . And in case you 're wondering how true this part of the story is , all I can tell you is that the conversation was repeated to me by Trevor Dawson , who was swabbingthe floors over there in officers ' country that day and heard it all . " Where the government sends the black boys is your problem , not mine , ' Mueller tells Major Fuller . My problem is where you 're letting them go on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown , there 's going to be trouble . We 've got the Legion in this town , you know . ' " Well , but I am in a bit of a tight here , Mr. Mueller , ' he says . I ca n't let them drink over at the NCO Club . Not only is it against the regulations for the Negroes to drink with the whites , they could n't anyway . It 's an NCO club , do n't you see ? Every one of those black boys is a bucky-tail private . " " That 's not my problem either . I simply trust you will take care of the matter . Responsibility accompanies rank . ' And off he goes . " Well , Fuller solved the problem . The Derry Army Base was a damn big patch of land in those days , although there was n't a hell of a lot on it . Better than a hundred acres , all told . Going north , it ended right behind West Broadway , where a sort of greenbelt was planted . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spot stood . " It was just an old requisition shed in early 1930 , when all of this happened , but Major Fuller mustered in Company E and tpld us it was going to be our ' club . Acted like he was Daddy Warbucks or something , and maybe he even felt that way , giving a bunch of black privates their own place , even if it was nothing but a shed . Then he added , like it was nothing , that the pigs downtown were off-limits to us . " There was a lot of bitterness about it , but what could we do ? We had no real power . It was this young fellow , a Pfc. named Dickp459Hallorann who was a mess-cook , who suggested that maybe we could fix it up pretty nice if we really tried . " So we did . We really tried . And we made out pretty well , all things considered . The first time a bunch of us went in there to look it over , we were pretty depressed . It was dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gone moldy . There was only two little windows and no lectricity . The floor was dirt . Carl Roone laughed in a kind of bitter way , I remember that , and said , The ole Maje , he a real prince , ai n't he ? Give us our own club . Shot ' " And George Brannock , who was also killed in the fire that fall , he said : Yeah , it 's a hell of a black spot , all right . ' And the name just stuck . " Hallorann got us going , though . . . Hallorann and Carl and me . I guess God will forgive us for what we did , though  --  cause He knows we had no idea how it would turn out . " After awhile the rest of the fellows pitched in . With most of Derry off-limits , there was n't much else we could do . We hammerec and nailed and cleaned . Trev Dawson was a pretty good jackle  --  carpenter , and he showed us how to cut some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snopes did n't come up with panes o1 glass for them that were different colors  --  sort of a cross betweer carnival glass and the sort you see in church windows . " Where 'd you get this ? ' I asked him . Alan was the oldest of us he was about forty-two , old enough so that most of us called him Pop Snopes . " He stuck a Camel in his mouth and tipped me a wink . Midnigh Requisitions , ' he says , and would say no more . " So the place come along pretty good , and by the middle of th' summer we was using it . Trev Dawson and some of the others ha ( partitioned off the back quarter of the building and got a littlf kitchen set up in there , not much more than a grill and a couplf of deep-fryers , so that you could get a hamburg and some frencl fries , if you wanted . There was a bar down one side , but it was jus meant for sodas and drinks like Virgin Marys  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught it ? If we wanted to drink hard , we ' ( do it in the dark . " The floor was still dirt , but we kept it oiled down nice . Tre ' and Pop Snopes ran in a lectric line  --  more Midnight Requisitionsp460I imagine . By July , you could go in there any Saturday night and sit down and have a cola and a hamburger  --  or a slaw-dog . It was nice . It never really got finished  --  we was still working on it when the fire burned it down . It got to be a kind of hobby . . . or a way of thumbing our noses at Fuller and Mueller and the Town Council . But I guess we knew it was ours when Ev McCaslin and I put up a sign one Friday night that said THE BLACK SPOT , and just below that , ( , OMMANY E AND GUESTS . Like we were exclusive , you know ! " It got looking nice enough that the white boys started to grumble about it , and next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking finer than ever . They was adding on a special lounge and a little cafeteria . It was like they wanted to race . But that was one race that we did n't want to run . " My dad smiled at me from his hospital bed . " We were young , except for Snopesy , but we were n't entirely foolish . We knew that the white boys let you race against them , but if it starts to look like you are getting ahead , why , somebody just breaks your legs so you ca n't run as fast . We had what we wanted , and that was enough . But then ... something happened . " He fell silent , frowning . " What was that , Daddy ? " " We found out that we had a pretty decent jazz-band among us , " he said slowly . " Martin Devereaux , who was a corporal , played drums . Ace Stevenson played cornet . Pop Snopes played a pretty decent barrelhouse piano . He was n't great , but he was n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and George Brannock played the saxophone . There were others of us who sat in from time to time , playing guitar or harmonica or juiceharp or even just a comb with waxed paper over it . " This did n't all happen at once , you understand , but by the end of that August , there was a pretty hot little Dixieland combo playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Black Spot . They got better and better as the fall drew on , and while they were never great  --  I do n't want to give you that idea  --  they played in a way that was different . . . hotter somehow ... it . . . " He waved his skinny hand above the bedclothes . " They played bodacious , " I suggested , grinning . " That 's right ! " he exclaimed , grinning back . " You got it ! They played bodacious Dixieland . And the next thing you know , people from town started to show up at our club . Even some of the whitep461soldiers from the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right smart every weekend . That did n't happen all at once , either . At first those white faces looked like sprinkles of salt in a pepper pot , but more and more of them turned up as time went on . " When those white people showed up , that 's when we forgot to be careful . They were bringin in their own booze in brown bags , most of it the finest high-tension stuff there is  --  made the stuff you could get in the pigs downtown look like soda pop . Country-club booze is what I mean , Mikey . Rich people 's booze . Chivas . Glenfiddich . The kind of champagne they served to first-class passengers on ocean liners . Champers , ' some of em called it , same as we used to call ugly-minded mules back home . We should have found a way to stop it , but we did n't know how . They was town ! Hell , they was white ! " And , like I said , we were young and proud of what we 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all knew that Mueller and his friends must have known what was going on , but I do n't think any of us realized that it was drivin em crazy  --  and I mean what I say : crazy . There they were in their grand old Victorian houses on West Broadway not a quarter of a mile away from where we were , listening to things like Aunt Hagar 's Blues ' and Diggin My Potatoes . ' That was bad . Knowing that their young people were there too , whooping it up right cheek by jowl with the blacks , that must have been ever so much worse . Because it was n't just the lumberjacks and the barbags that were turning up as September came into October . It got to be kind of a thing in town . Young folks would come to drink and to dance to that nonamejazz-band until one in the morning came and shut us down . They did n't just come from Derry , either . They come from Bangor and Newport and Haven and Cleaves Mills and Old Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see fraternity boys from the University of Maine at Orono cutting capers with their sorority girlfriends , and when the band learned how to play a ragtimeversion of The Maine Stein Song , ' they just about ripped the roof off . Of course , it was an enlisted-men 's club  --  technically , at least  --  and off-limits to civilians who did n't have an invitation . But in fact , Mikey , we just opened the door at seven and let her stand open until one . By the middle of October it got so that any time you went out on the dancefloor you were standing hip to hip with six other people . There was n't no room to dance , so you had top462just sort of stand there and wiggle ... but if anyone minded , I never heard him let on . By midnight , it was like an empty freight-car rocking and reeling on an express run . " He paused , took another drink of water , and then went on . His eyes were bright now . " Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later . If it had been sooner , a lot less people would have died . All he had to do was send in MPs and have them confiscate all the bottles of liquor t hat people had brought in with them . That would have been good enough  --  just what he wanted , in fact . It would have shut us down good and proper . There would have been court-martials and the stockade in Rye for some of us and transfers for all the rest . But Fuller was slow . I think he was afraid of the same thing some of us was afraid of  --  that some of the townies would be mad . Mueller had n't been back to see him , and I think Major Fuller must have been scared to go downtown and see Mueller . He talked big , Fuller did , but he had all the spine of a jellyfish . " So instead of the thing ending in some put-up way that would have at least left all those that burned up that night still alive , the Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets early that November and cooked themselves a barbecue . " He fell silent again , not sipping at his water this time , only looking moodily into the far corner of his room while outside a bell dinged softly somewhere and a nurse passed the open doorway , the soles of her shoes squeaking on the linoleum . I could hear a TV someplace , a radio someplace else . I remember that I could hear the wind blowing outside , snuffling up the side of the building . And although it was August , the wind made a cold sound . It knew nothing of Cain 's Hundred on the television , or the Four Seasons singing " Walk Like a Man " on the radio . " Some of them came through that greenbelt between the base and West Broadway , " he resumed at last . " They must have met at someone 's house over there , maybe in the basement , to get their sheets on and to make the torches that they used . " I 've heard that others came right onto the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base back then . I heard  --  I wo n't say where  --  that they came in a brand-new Packard automobile , dressed in their white sheets with their white goblin-hats on their laps and torches on the floor . The torches were Louisville Sluggers with big hunks of burlap snugged down over the fat partsp463with red rubber gaskets , the kind ladies use when they put up preserves . There was a booth where Ridgeline Road branched ot1 Witcham Road and came onto the base , and the O.D. passed that Packard right along . " It was Saturday night and the joint was jumping , going round and round . There might have been two hundred people there , maybe three . And here came these white men , six or eight in their bottle-green Packard , and more coming through the trees between the base and the fancy houses on West Broadway . They was n't young , not many of them , and sometimes I wonder how many cases of angina and bleeding ulcers there were the next day . I hope there was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked on the hill and flashed its lights twice . About four men got out of it and joined the rest . Some had those twogallontins of gasoline that you could buy at service stations back in those days . All of them had torches . One of em stayed behind the wheel of that Packard . Mueller had a Packard , you know . Yes he did . A green one . " They got together at the back of the Black Spot and doused their torches with gas . Maybe they only meant to scare us . I 've heard it the other way , but I 've heard it that way , too . I 'd rather believe that 's how they meant it , because I ai n't got feeling mean enough even yet to want to believe the worst . " It could have been that the gas dripped down to the handles of some of those torches and when they lit them , why , those holding them panicked and threw them any whichway just to get rid of them . Whatever , that black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding em up and waving em around , little flaming pieces of burlap falling off n the tops of em . Some of them were laughing . But like I say , some of the others up and threw em through the back windows , into what was our kitchen . The place was burning merry hell in a minute and a half . " The men outside , they were all wearing their peaky white hoods by then . Some of them were chanting Come out , niggers ! Come out , niggers ! Come out , niggers ! ' Maybe some of them were chantingto scare us , but I like to believe most of em were trying to warn us  --  same way as I like to believe that maybe those torches going into the kitchen the way they did was an accident . " Either way , it did n't much matter . The band was playing louder'n a factory whistle . Everybody was whooping it up and having a goodp464time . Nobody inside knew anything was wrong until Gerry McCrew , who was playing assistant cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn near got blowtorched . Flames shot out ten feet and burned his messjacket right off . Burned most of his hair off as well . " I was sitting about halfway down the east wall with Trev Dawson and I ) it k I Ialloraun when it happened , and at first I had an idea the gas stove had exploded . I 'd no more than got on my feet when I was knocked dowel by people headed for the door . About two dozen of em went marchin right up my back , an 1 guess that was the only time during the whole thing when I really felt scared . I could hear people screamin and tellin each other they had to get out , the place waslon fire . But every time I tried to get up , someone fixated me right back down again . Someone landed his big shoe square on the back of my head and I saw stars . My nose mashed on that oiled floor and I snuffled up dirt and began to cough and sneeze at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt a lady 's high heel slam down between the cheeks of my butt , and son , I never want another half-ass enema like that one . If the seat of my khakis had ripped , I believe I 'd be bleedin down there to this day . " It sounds funny now , but I damn near died in that stampede . I was whopped , whapped , stomped , walked on , and kicked in so many places I could n't walk ' tall the next day . I was screaming and none of those people topside heard me or paid any mind . " It was Trev saved me . I seen this big brown hand in front of me and I grabbed it like a drownin man grabs a life preserver . I grabbed and he hauled and up I came . Someone 's foot got me in the side of my neck right here  --  " He massaged that area where the jaw turns up toward the ear , and I nodded. "  --  and it hurt so bad that I guess I blacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trev 's hand , and he never let go of mine . I got to my feet , finally , just as the wall we 'd put up between the kitchen and the hall fell over . It made a noise like  --  ftoomp  --  the noise a puddle of gasoline makes when you light it . I saw it go over in a big bundle of sparks , and I saw the people running to get out of its way as it fell . Some of em made it . Some did n't . One of our fellas  --  I think it might have been Hort Sartoris  --  was buried under it , and for just one second I seen his hand underneath all thosep465blazing coals , openin' and closin . There was a white girl , surely no more than twenty , and the back of her dress went up . She was with a college boy and I heard her screamin at him , beggin him to help her . He took just about two swipes at it and then ran away with the others . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was like hell out where the kitchen had been . The flames was so bright you could n't look at them . The heat was bakin hot , Mikey , roastin hot . You could feel your skin going shiny . You could feel the hairs in your nose gettin crispy . " We got ta break outta here ! ' Trev yells , and starts to drag me along the wall . Come on ! ' " Then Dick Hallorann catches hold of him . He could n't have been no more than nineteen , and his eyes was as big as bil'ard balls , but he kept his head better than we did . He saved our lives . Not that way ! ' he yells . This way ! ' And he pointed back toward the bandstand . . . toward the fire , you know . " You 're crazy ! ' Trevor screamed back . He had a big bull voice , but you could barely hear him over the thunder of the fire and the screaming people . Die if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " He still had me by the hand and he started to haul me toward the door again , although there were so many people around it by then you could n't see it at all . I would have gone with him . I was so shell-shocked I did n't know what end was up . All I knew was that I did n't want to be baked like a human turkey . " Dick grabbed Trev by the hair of the head just as hard as he could , and when Trev turned back , Dick slapped his face . I rememberseeing Trev 's head bounce off the wall and thinking Dick had gone crazy . Then he was hollerin in Trev 's face , You go that way and you goan die ! They jammed up against that door , nigger ! ' " You do n't know that ! ' Trev screamed back at him , and then there was this loud BANG ! like a firecracker , only what it was , it was the heat exploding Marty Devereaux 's bass drum . The fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor was catchin . " I know it ! ' Dick screams back . I know it ! ' " He grabbed my other hand , and for a minute there I felt like the rope in a tug-o-war game . Then Trev took a good look at the door and went Dick 's way . Dick got us down to a window and grabbed a chair to bust it out , but before he could swing it , thep466heat blew it out for him . Then he grabbed Trev Dawson by the back of his pants and hauled him up . Climb ! ' he shouts . Climb , motherfucker ! ' And Trev went , head up and tail over the dashboard . " He boosted me next , and I went up . I grabbed the sides of the window and hauled . I had a good crop of blisters all over my palms the next day : that wood was already smokin . I come out headfirst , and if Trev had n't grabbed me I mighta broke my neck . " We turned back around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever had , Mikey . That window was just a yellow , blazin square of light . Flames was shootin up through that tin roof in a dozen places . We could hear people screamin inside . " I saw two brown hands waving around in front of the fire  --  Dick 's hands . Trev Dawson made me a step with his own hands and I reached through that window and grabbed Dick . When I took his weight my gut went against the side of the building , and it was like having your belly against a stove that 's just starting to get real good and hot . Dick 's face came up and for a few seconds I did n't think we was going to be able to get him . He 'd taken a right smart of smoke , and he was close to passing out . His lips had cracked open . The back of his shirt was smoldering . " And then I damn near let go , because I could smell the people burning inside . I 've heard people say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like that . It 's more like what happens sometimesafter they geld hosses . They build a big fire and throw all that shit into it and when the fire gets hot enough you can hear them hossballs poppin like chestnuts , and that 's what people smell like when they start to cook right inside their clo'es . I could smell that and I knew I could n't take it for long so I gave one more great big yank , and out came Dick . He lost one of his shoes . " I tumbled off Trev 's hands and went down . Dick come down on top of me , and I 'm here to tell you that nigger 's head was hard . I lost most of my breath and just laid there on the dirt for a few seconds , rolling around and holding my bellyguts . " Presently I was able to get to my knees , then to my feet . And I seen these shapes running off toward the greenbelt . At first I thought they were ghosts , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Spot it was like daylight . I seen shoes and understood it was men wearin sheets . One of them had fallen a little bit behind the others and I saw ... " He trailed off , licking his lips.  |p467  " What did you see , Daddy ? " I asked . " Never you mind , " he said . " Give me my water , Mikey . " I did . He drank most of it and then got coughing . A passing nurse looked in and said : " Do you need anything , Mr. Hanlon ? " " New set of ' testines , " my dad said . " You got any handy , Rhoda ? " She smiled a nervous , doubtful smile and passed on . My dad handed the glass to me and I put it back on his table . " It 's longer tellin than it is rememberin , " he said . " You goan fill that glass up for me before you leave ? " " Sure , Daddy . " " This story goan give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie , and then thought better of it . And I think now that if I had lied , he would have stopped right there . He was far gone by then , but maybe not that far gone . " I guess so , " 1 said . " That 's not such a bad thing , " he said to me . " In nightmares we can think the worst . That 's what they 're for , I guess . " He reached out his hand and I took it and we held hands while he finished . " I looked around just in time to see Trev and Dick goin around the front of the building , and I chased after them , still trying to catch m'wind . There was maybe forty or fifty people out there , some of them cryin , some of them pukin , some of them screamin , some of them doing all three things at once , it seemed like . Others were layin on the grass , fainted dead away with the smoke . The door was shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screamin to let them out , out for the love of Jesus , they were burningup . " It was the only door , except for the one that went out through the kitchen to where the garbage cans and things were , you see . To go in you pushed the door open . To go out you had to pull it . " Some people had gotten out , and then they started to jam up at that door and push . The door got slammed shut . The ones in the back kept pushin forward to get away from the fire , and everybodygot jammed up . The ones right up front were squashed . Was n't no way they could get that door open against the weight of all those behind . So there they were , trapped , and the fire raged . " It was Trev Dawson that made it so it was only eighty or so that died instead of a hundred or maybe two hundred , and what he got for his pains was n't a medal but two years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old friend Sergeant Wilson , the fellawho owned all the holes there on the base . " He gets out and starts shoutin orders that did n't make much sense and will ( h people could n't hear anyway . Trev grabbed my arm and we run over to him . I 'd lost all track of Dick Hallorann by then and did n't even see him until the next day . " ' Sergeant , I have to use your truck ! ' Trev yells in his face. " ' ( pct out of my way , nigger , ' Wilson says , and pushes him down . Then he starts yelling all that confused shit again . Was n't nobody paying any attention to him , and he did n't go on for long anyway , because Trevor Dawson popped up like a jack-in-the-box and decked him . " Trev could hit damned hard , and almost any other man would have stayed down , but that cracker had a hard head . He got up , blood pouring out of his mouth and nose , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , Trev hit him in the belly just as hard as he could , and when he doubled over I put my hands together and pounded the back of his neck just as hard as I could . It was a cowardly thing to do , hitting a man from behind like that , but desperate times call for desperate measures . And I would be lyin , Mikey , if I did n't tell you that hitting that poormouth sonofabitch did n't give me a bit of pleasure . " Down he went , just like a steer hit with a poleaxe . Trev run to the truck , fired it up , and drove it around so it was facin the front of the Black Spot , but to the left of the door . He th'owed it into first , popped the clutch on that cocksucker , and here he come ! " ' Look out there ! ' I shouted at that crowd of people standing around . " Ware that truck ! ' " " They scattered like quail , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the side of the building going maybe thirty , and cracked his face a good one on the steerin wheel of the truck . I seen the blood fly from his nose when he shook his head to clear it . He punched out reverse , backed up fifty yards , and come down on her again . WHAM ! The Black Spot was n't nothing but corrugatedtin , and that second hit did her . The whole side of that oven fell in and the flames come roarin out . How anything could have still been alive in there I do n't know , but there was . People are a lot tougher than you 'd believe , Mikey , and if you do n't believe it , just take a look at me , slidin off the skin of the world by myp469flames and smoke , but people came running out to a regular  --  Prrv ; , . There were so many that Trev did n't even dare back the trut k up again for fear he would run over some of them . So he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . " We stood there , watching it end . It had n't been five minutes all told , but it felt like forever . The last dozen or so that made it out were on fire . People grabbed em and started to roll em around on the ground , trying to put em out . Looking in , we could see other people trying to come , and we knew they was n't never going to make it . " Trev grabbed my hand and I grabbed him back twice as hard . We stood there holding hands just like you and me are doing now , Mikey , him with his nose broke and blood running down his face and his eyes puffing shut , and we watched them people . They were the real ghosts we saw that night , nothing but shimmers shaped like men and women in that fire , walking toward the opening Trev had bashed with Sergeant Wilson 's truck . Some of em had their arms held out , like they expected someone to save them . The others just- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their clo'es were blazin . Their faces were runnin . And one after another they just toppled over and you did n't see them no more . " The last one was a woman . Her dress had burned off her and there she was in her slip . She was burnin like a candle . She seemed to look right at me at the end , and I seen her eyelids was on fire . " When she fell down it was over . The whole place went up in a pillar of fire . By the time the base firetrucks and two more from the Main Street fire station got there , it was already burning itself out . That was the fire at the Black Spot , Mikey . " He drank the last of his water and handed me the glass to fill at the drinking fountain in the hall . " Goan piss the bed tonight I guess , Mikey . " I kissed his cheek and then went out into the hall to fill his glass . When I returned , he was drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put the glass on the nighttable , he mumbled a thank-you I could barely understand . I looked at the Westclox on his table and saw it was almost eight . Time for me to go home . I leaned over to kiss him goodbye . . . and instead heard myself whisper , " What did you see ? " His eyes , which were now slipping shut , barely turned towardp470the sound of my voice . He might have known it was me , or he might have believed he was hearing the voice of his own thoughts . " Hunh ? " " The thing you saw , " I whispered . I did n't want to hear , but I had to hear . I was both hot and cold , my eyes burning , my hands freezing . But I had to hear . As I suppose Lot 's wife had to turn back and look at the destruction of Sodom . " " I'was a bird , " he said . " Right over the last of those runnin men . A hawk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was big . Never told no one . Would have been locked up . That bird was maybe sixty feet from wingtip to wingtip . It was the size of a Japanese Zero . But I seen . . . seen its eyes ... and I think . . . it seen me .... " His head slipped over to the side , toward the window , where the dark was coming . " It swooped down and grabbed that last man up . Got him right by the sheet , it did . . . and I heard that bird 's wings .... The sound was like fire . . . and it hovered . . . and I thought , Birds ca n't hover . . . but this one could , because . . . because ... " He fell silent . " Why , Daddy ? " I whispered . " Why could it hover ? " " It did n't hover , " he said . I sat there in silence , thinking he had gone to sleep for sure this time . I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years before , I had seen that bird . Somehow , in some unimaginable way , I had nearly forgotten that nightmare . It was my father who brought it back . " It did n't hover , " he said . " It floated . It floated . There were big bunches of balloons tied to each wing , and it floated . " My father went to sleep . March 1st , 1985It 's come again . I know that now . I 'll wait , but in my heart I knowit . I 'm not sure I can stand it . As a kid I was able to deal with it , but it 's different with kids . In some fundamental way it 's different . I wrote all of that last night in a kind of frenzy  --  not that I couldhave gone home anyway . Derry has been blanketed in a thick glazeof ice , and although the sun is out this morning , nothing is moving . I wrote until long after three this morning , pushing the pen fasterand faster , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing thep471giant bird when I was eleven . It was my father 's story that brought it back . . . and I never forgot it again . Not any of it . In a way , I suppose it was his final gift to me . A terrible gift , you would say , but wonderful in its way . I slept right where I was , my head in my arms , my notebook and pen on the table in front of me . I woke up this morning with a numb ass and an aching back , but feeling free , somehow . . . purged of that old story . And then I saw that I had had company in the night , as I slept . The tracks , drying to faint muddy impressions , led from the front door of the library ( which I locked ; I always lock it ) to the desk where I slept . There were no tracks leading away . Whatever it was , it came to me in the night , left its talisman. . . and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single balloon . Filled with helium , it floated in a morning sunray which slanted in through one of the high windows . On it was a picture of my face , the eyes gone , blood running down from the ragged sockets , a scream distorting the mouth on the balloon 's thin and bulging rubber skin . I looked at it and I screamed . The scream echoed through the library , echoing back , vibrating from the circular iron staircase leadingto the stacks . The balloon burst with a bang.  |p475The  telephone was ringing , bringing him up and out of a sleep too deep for dreams . He groped for it without opening his eyes , without coming more than halfway awake . If it had stopped ringing just then he would have slipped back down into sleep without a hitch ; he would have done it as simply and easily as he had once slipped down the snow-covered hills in McCarron Park on his Flexible Flyer . You ran with the sled , threw yourself onto it , and down you went  --  seemingly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grownup ; it racked the hell out of your balls . His fingers walked over the telephone 's dial , slipped off , climbed it again . He had a dim premonition that it would be Mike Hanlon , Mike Hanlon calling from Derry , telling him he had to come back , telling him he had to remember , telling him they had made a promise , Stan Uris had cut their palms with a sliver of Coke bottle and they had made a promiseExcept all of that had already happened . He had gotten in late yesterday afternoon  --  just before 6 P.M. , actually . He supposed that , if he had been the last call on Mike 's list , all of them must have gotten in at varying times ; some might even have spent most of the day here . He himself had seen none of them , felt no urge to see any of them . He had simply checked in , gone up to his room , ordered a meal from room service whichp476he found he could not eat once it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and slept dreamlessly until now . Bill cracked one eye open and fumbled for the telephone 's handset . It fell off onto the table and he groped for it , opening his other eye . He felt totally blank inside his head , totally unplugged , running on batteries. f le finally managed to scoop up the phone . He got up on one elbow and put it against his ear . " Hello ? " " lull ' " It teas Mike Hanlon 's voice  --  he 'd had at least that much right last week he did n't remember Mike at all , and now a single word was enough to identify him . It was rather marvellous . . . but in an ominous way . " Yeah , Mike . " " Woke you up , huh ? " " Yeah , you did . That 's okay . " On the wall above the TV was an abysmal painting of lobstermen in yellow slickers and rainhats pullinglobster traps . Looking at it , Bill remembered where he was : the Derry Town House on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street was Bassey Park . . . the Kissing Bridge . . . the Canal . " What time is it , Mike ? " " Quarter of ten . " " What day ? " " The 30th . " Mike sounded a little amused . " Yeah . ' Kay . " " I 've arranged a little reunion , " Mike said . He sounded diffident now . " Yeah ? " Bill swung his legs out of bed . " They all came ? " " All but Stan Uris , " Mike said . Now there was something in his voice that Bill could n't read . " Bev was the last one . She got in late last evening . " " Why do you say the last one , Mike ? Stan might show up today . " " Bill , Stan 's dead . " " What ? How ? Did his plane  --  " " Nothing like that , " Mike said . " Look , if it 's all the same to you , I think it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could tell all of you at the same time . " " It has to do with this ? " " Yes , I think so . " Mike paused briefly . " I 'm sure it does . " Bill felt the familiar weight of dread settle around his heart again  --  was it something you could get used to so quickly , then ? Or hadp477it been something he had carried all along , simply unfelt and unthought-of , like the inevitable fact of his own death ? He reached for his cigarettes , lit one , and blew out the match with the first drag . " None of them got together yesterday ? " " No  --  I do n't believe so . " " And you have n't seen any of us yet . " " No  --  just talked to you on the phone . " " Okay , " he said . " Where 's the reunion ? " " You remember where the old Ironworks used to be ? " " Pasture Road , sure . " " You 're behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . We 've got the third-biggest shopping mall in the state out there . Forty-eight Different Merchants Under One Roof for Your Shopping Convenience . " " Sounds really A-A-American , all right . " " Bill ? " " What ? " " You all right ? " " Yes . " But his heart was beating too fast , the tip of his cigarette jittering a tiny bit . He had stuttered . Mike had heard it . There was a moment of silence and then Mike said , " Just out past the mall , there 's a restaurant called Jade of the Orient . They have private rooms for parties . I arranged for one of them yesterday . We can have it the whole afternoon , if we want it . " " You think this might take that long ? " " I just do n't know . " " A cab will know how to get there ? " " Sure . " " All right , " Bill said . He wrote the name of the restaurant down on the pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it 's new , I guess , " Mike said slowly . " It seemed like . . . I do n't know ... " " Neutral ground ? " Bill suggested . " Yes . I guess that 's it . " " Food any good ? " " I do n't know , " Mike said . " How 's your appetite ? " Bill chuffed out smoke and half-laughed , half-coughed . " It ai n't so good , ole pal . " " Yeah , " Mike said . " I hear you . "  |p478  " Noon ? " " More like one , I guess . We 'll let Beverly catch a few more z 's . " Bill snuffed the cigarette . " She married ? " Mike hesitated again . " We 'll catch up on everything , " he said . " Just like when you go back to your high-school reunion ten years later , huh ? " Bill said . " You get to see who got fat , who got bald , who got k-kids . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah . Me too , Mikey . Me too . " l le hung up the phone , took a long shower , and ordered a breakfastthat he did n't want and which he only picked at . No ; his appetite was really not much good at all . Bill dialed the Big Yellow Cab Company and asked to be picked up at quarter of one , thinking that fifteen minutes would be plenty of time to get him out to Pasture Road ( he found himself totally unable to think of it as Mall Road ; even when he actually saw the mall ) , but he had underestimated the lunch-hour traffic-flow ... and how much Derry had grown . In 1958 it had been a big town , not much more . There were maybe thirty thousand people inside the Derry incorporated city limits and maybe another seven thousand beyond that in the surroundingburgs . Now it had become a city  --  a very small city by London or New York standards , but doing just fine by Maine standards , where Portland , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the cab moved slowly down Main Street ( we 're over the Canal now , Bill thought ; ca n't see it , but it 's down there , running in the dark ) and then turned up Center , his first thought was predictable enough : how much had changed . But the predictable thought was accompanied by a deep dismay that he never would have expected . He remembered his childhood here as a fearful , nervous time . . . not only because of the summer of ' 58 , when the seven of them had faced the terror , but because of George 's death , the deep dream his parents seemed to have fallen into following that death , the constant ragging about his stutter , Bowers and Huggins and Criss constantly on the prod for them after the rockfight in the Barrensp479 ( Bowers and Huggins and Criss , oh my ! Bowers and Huggins and Criss , oh my ! ) and just a feeling that Derry was cold , that Derry was hard , that Derry did n't much give a shit if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they triumphed over Pennywise the Clown . Derryfolkhad lived with Pennywise in all his guises for a long time . . . and maybe , in some mad way , they had even come to understand him . To like him , need him . Love him ? Maybe . Yes , maybe that too . So why this dismay ? Perhaps only because it seemed such dull change , somehow . Or perhaps because Derry seemed to have lost its essential face for him . The Bijou Theater was gone , replaced with a parking lot ( BY PERMIT ONLY , the sign over the ramp announced ; VIOLATORS SUBJECTTO TOW ) . The Shoeboat and Bailley 's Lunch , which had stood next to it , were also gone . They had been replaced by a branch of the Northern National Bank . A digital readout jutted from the front of the bland cinderblock structure , showing the time and the temperature  --  the latter in both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius . The Center Street Drug , lair of Mr. Keene and the place where Bill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Richard 's Alley had become some strange hybrid called a " mini-mall . " Looking inside as the cab idled at a stoplight , Bill could see a record shop , a natural-foods store , and a toys-and-games shop which was featuring a clearance sale on ALL DUNGEONS AND DRAGONSSUPPLIES . The cab pulled forward with a jerk . " Gon na take awhile , " the driver said . " I wish all these goddam banks would stagger their lunch-hours . Pardon my French if you 're a religious man . " " That 's all right , " Bill said . It was overcast outside , and now a few splatters of rain hit the cab 's windshield . The radio muttered about an escaped mental patient from somewhere who was supposedto be very dangerous , and then began muttering about the Red Sox who were n't . Showers early , then clearing . When Barry Manilow began moaning about Mandy , who came and who gave without takin ' , the cabbie snapped the radio off . Bill asked , " When did they go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-huh . "  |p480  " Oh , late sixties , early seb'nies , most of em , " the cabbie said . He was a big man with a thick neck . He wore a red-and-black-checked hunter 's jacket . A fluorescent-orange cap was jammed down squarely on his head . It was smudged with engine-oil . " They got this urbanrenewalmoney . Reb'nue Sharin , they call it . So how they shared it was rip down everythin . And the banks come in . I guess that was all that could afford to come in . Hell of a note , ai n't it ? Urban renewal , says they . Shit for dinner , says I. Pardon my French if you 're a religious man . There was a lot of talk about how they was gon na revitalize the downtown . Ayup , they revitalized it just fine . Tore down most the old stores and put up a lot of banks and parking lots . And you know you still ca n't find a fucking slot to park your car in . Ought to string the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Polock woman that 's on it . String her up by her tits . On second thought , it do n't seem like she 's got any . Flat as a fuckin board . Pardon my French if you 're a religious man . " " I am , " Bill said , grinning . " Then get outta my cab and go to fucking church , " the cabbie said , and they both burst out laughing . " You lived here long ? " Bill asked . " My whole life . Born in Derry Home Hospital , and they 'll bury my fuckin remains out in Mount Hope Cemetery . " " Good deal , " Bill said . " Yeah , right , " the cabbie said . He hawked , rolled down his window , and spat an extremely large yellow-green lunger into the rainy air . His attitude , contradictory but somehow attractive  --  almost piquant  --  wasone of glum good cheer . " Guy who catches that wo n't have to buy no fuckin chewing gum for a week . Pardon my French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't all changed , " Bill said . The depressing promenade of banks and parking lots was slipping behind them as they climbed Center Street . Over the hill and past the First National , they began to pick up some speed . " The Aladdin 's still there . " " Yeah , " the cabbie conceded . " But just barely . Suckers tried to tear that down , too . " " For another bank ? " Bill asked , a part of him amused to find that another part of him stood aghast at the idea . He could n't believe that anyone in his right mind would want to tear down that stately pleasure dome with its glittering glass chandelier , its sweeping rightand-leftstaircases which spiraled up to the balcony , and its mam/moth curtain , which did not simply pull apart when the show started but which instead rose in magical folds and tucks and gathers , all underlit in fabulous shades of red and blue and yellow and green while pullies offstage ratcheted and groaned . Not the Aladdin , that shocked part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of tearing down the Aladdin for a BANK ? " Oh , ayup , a bank , " the cabbie said . " You 're fucking-A , pardon my French if you 're a religious man . It was the First Merchants of Penobscot County had its eye on the ' laddin . Wanted to pull it down and put up what they called a complete banking mall . ' Got all the papers from the City Council , and the Aladdin was condemned . Then a bunch of folks formed a committee  --  folks that had lived here a long time  --  and they petitioned , and they marched , and they hollered , and finally they had a public City Council meeting about it , and Hanlon blew those suckers out . " The cabbie sounded extremely satisfied . " Hanlon ? " Bill asked , startled . " Mike Hanlon ? " " Ayup , " the cabbie said . He twisted around briefly to look at Bill , revealing a round , chapped face and horn-rimmed glasses with old specks of white paint on the bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did , " Bill said , remembering how he had met Mike , back in July 1958 . It had been Bowers and Huggins and Criss again . . . of course . Bowers and Huggins and Criss ( oh my ) at every turn , playing their own part , unwitting visegrips driving the seven of them together  --  tight , tighter , tightest . " We played together when we were kids . Before I moved away . " " Well , there you go , " the cabbie said . " It 's a small fucking world , pardon my  --  " "  --  French if you 're a religious man , " Bill finished with him . " There you go , " the cabbie repeated comfortably , and they rode in silence for awhile before he said , " It 's changed a lot , Derry has , but yeah , a lot of it 's still here . The Town House , where I picked you up . The Standpipe in Memorial Park . You remember that place , mister ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was haunted . " " I remember it , " Bill said . " Look , there 's the hospital . You recognize it ? " They were passing the Derry Home Hospital on the right now . Behind it , the Penobscot flowed toward its meeting-place with thep482Kenduskeag . Under the rainy spring sky , the river was dull pewter . The hospital that Bill remembered  --  a white woodframe building with two wings , three stories high  --  was still there , but now it was surrounded , dwarfed , by a whole complex of buildings , maybe a dozen in all . He could see a parking-lot off to the left , and what looked like better than five hundred cars parked there . " My God , that 's not a hospital , that 's a fucking college campus ! " Bill exclaimed . The cab-driver cackled . " Not bein a religious man , I 'll pardon your French . Yeah , it 's almost as big as the Eastern Maine up in Bangor now . They got radiation labs and a therapy center and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else . The old hospital 's still there , but it 's all administration now . " Bill felt a queer doubling sensation in his mind , the sort of sensationhe remembered getting the first time he watched a 3-D movie . Trying to bring together two images that did n't quite jibe . You could fool your eyes and your brain into doing that trick , he remembered , but you were apt to end . up with a whopper of a headache . . . and he could feel his own headache coming on now , New Derry , fine . But the old Derry was still here , like the wooden Home Hospital building . The old Derry was mostly buried under all the new construction . . . but your eye was somehow dragged helplessly back to look at it . . . to look for it . " The trainyard 's probably gone , is n't it ? " Bill asked . The cabbie laughed again , delighted . " For someone who moved away when he was just a kid , you got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have met me last week , my French-speaking friend . " It 's all still out there , but it 's nothing but ruins and rusty tracks now . The freights do n't even stop no more . Fella wanted to buy the land and put up a whole roadside entertainment thing  --  pitch ' n putt , batting cages , driving ranges , mini golf , go-karts , little shack fulla video games , I do n't know whatall  --  but there 's some kind of big mixup about who owns the land now . I guess he 'll get it eventually  --  he'sa persistent fella  --  but right now it 's in the courts . " " And the Canal , " Bill murmured as they turned off Outer Center Street and onto Pasture Road  --  which , as Mike had said , was now marked with a green roadsign reading MALL ROAD . " The Canal 's still here . " " Ayup , " the cabbie said . " That 'll always be here , I guess . "  |p483Now  the Derry Mall was on Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that queer doubling sensation again . When they had been kids all of this had been a great long field full of rank grasses and gigantic nodding sunflowers which marked the northeastern end of the Barrens . Behind it , to the west , was the Old Cape low-income housing development . He could remember them exploring this field , being careful not to fall into the gaping cellarhold of the Kitchener Ironworks , which had exploded on Easter Sunday in the year 1906 . The field had been full of relics and they had unearthed them with all the solemn interest of archaeologists exploring Egyptianruins : bricks , dippers , chunks of iron with rusty bolts hanging from them , panes of glass , bottles full of unnamable gunk that smelled like the worst poison in the world . Something bad had happened near here , too , in the gravel-pit close to the dump , but he could not remember it yet . He could only remember a name , Patrick Humboldt , and that it had something to do with a refrigerator . And something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He shook his head . Fragments . Straws in the wind . That was all . The field was gone now , as were the remains of the Ironworks . Bill remembered the great chimney of the Ironworks suddenly . Faced with tile , caked black with soot for the final ten feet of its length , it had lain in the high grass like a gigantic pipe . They had scrambled up somehow and had walked along it , arms held out like tightwire walkers , laughingHe shook his head , as if to dismiss the mirage of the mall , an ugly collection of buildings with signs that said SEARS and J. C. PENNEY and WOOLWORTH 'S and cvs and YORK 'S STEAK HOUSE and WALDENBOOKS and dozens of others . Roads wove in and out of parking lots . The mall did not go away , because it was no mirage . The Kitchener Ironworks was gone , and the field that had grown up around its ruins was likewise gone . The mall was the reality , not the memories . But somehow he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the cabbie said . He pulled into the parking-lotof a building that looked like a large plastic pagoda . " A little late , but better late than never , am I right ? " " Indeed you are , " Bill said . He gave the cab-driver a five . " Keep the change . "  |p484  " Good fucking deal ! " the cabbie exclaimed . " You need someone to drive you , call Rig Yellow and ask for Dave . Ask for me by name . " " I 'll just ask for the religious fella , " Bill said , grinning . " The one who 's got his plot all picked out in Mount Hope . " " You got it , " Dave said , laughing . " Have a good one , mister . " " You too , Dave . " He stood in the light rain for a moment , watching the cab draw away . He realized that he had meant to ask the driver one more question , and had forgotten  --  perhaps on purpose . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abruptly , Bill Denbrough turned and walked into the Jade of the Orient . Mike Hanlon was in the lobby , sitting in a wicker chair with a huge flaring back . He got to his feet , and Bill felt deep unreality wash over him  --  through him . That sensation of doubling was back , but now it was much , much worse . He remembered a boy who had been about five feet three , trim , and agile . Before him was a man who stood about five-seven . He was skinny . His clothes seemed to hang on him . And the lines in his face said that he was on the darker side of forty instead of only thirty-eight or so . Bill 's shock must have shown on his face , because Mike said quietly : " I know how I look . " Bill flushed and said , " It 's not that bad , Mike , it 's just that I remember you as a kid . That 's all it is . " " Is it ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tired , " Mike said , " but I 'll make it . I guess . " He smiled then , and the smile lit his face . In it Bill saw the boy he had known twenty-seven years ago . As the old woodframe Home Hospitalhad been overwhelmed with modern glass and cinderblock , so had the boy that Bill had known been overwhelmed with the inevitable accessories of adulthood . There were wrinkles on his forehead , lines had grooved themselves from the corners of his mouth nearly to his chin , and his hair was graying on both sides above the ears . But as the old hospital , although overwhelmed , was still there , still visible , so was the boy Bill had known . Mike stuck out his hand and said , " Welcome back to Derry , Big Bill . " Bill ignored the hand and embraced Mike . Mike hugged himp485back fiercely , and Bill could feel his hair , stiff and kinky , against his own shoulder and the side of his neck . " Whatever 's wrong , Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I is heard the rough sound of tears in his throat and did n't care . " We beat it once , and we can b-beat it a-a-again . " Mike pulled away from him , held him at arm 's length ; although he was still smiling , there was too much sparkle in his eyes . He took out his handkerchief and wiped them . " Sure , Bill , " he said . " You bet . " " Would you gentlemen like to follow me ? " the hostess asked . She was a smiling Oriental woman in a delicate pink kimono upon which a dragon cavorted and curled its plated tail . Her dark hair was piled high on her head and held with ivory combs . " I know the way , Rose , " Mike said . " Very good , Mr. Hanlon . " She smiled at both of them . " You are well met in friendship , I think . " " I think we are , " Mike said . " This way , Bill . " He led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and toward a door where a beaded curtain hung . " The others  --  ? " Bill began . " All here now , " Mike said . " All that could come . " Bill hesitated for a moment outside the door , suddenly frightened . It was not the unknown that scared him , not the supernatural ; it was the simple knowledge that he was fifteen inches taller than he had been in 1958 and minus most of his hair . He was suddenly uneasy  --  almost terrified  --  at the thought of seeing them all again , their children 's faces almost worn away , almost buried under change as the old hospital had been buried . Banks erected inside their heads where once magic picture-palaces had stood . We grew up , he thought . We did n't think it would happen , not then , not to us . But it did , and if I go in there it will be real : we 're all grownups now . He looked at Mike , suddenly bewildered and timid . " How do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Mike . . . how do they look ? " " Come in and find out , " Mike said , kindly enough , and led Bill into the small private room.  |p486Bill  Uenbrough Gets a LookPerhaps it was simply the dimness of the room that caused the illusion , which lasted for only the briefest moment , but Bill wonderedlater if it was n't some sort of message meant strictly for him : that fate could also be kind . In that brief moment it seemed to him that none of them had grown up , that his friends had somehow done a Peter Pan act and were all still children . Richie Tozier was rocked back in his chair so that he was leaning against the wall , caught in the act of saying something to Beverly Marsh , who had a hand cupped over her mouth to hide a giggle ; Richie had a wise-ass grin on his face that was perfectly familiar . There was Eddie Kaspbrak , sitting on Beverly 's left , and in front of him on the table , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle curving down from its top . The trimmings were a little more state-of-the-art , but the purpose was obviously the same : it was an aspirator . Sitting at one end of the table , watching this trio with an expression of mixed anxiety , amusement , and concentration , was Ben Hanscom . Bill found his hand wanting to go to his head and realized with a sorry kind of amusement that in that second he had almost rubbed his pate to see if his hair had magically come back  --  that red , fine hair that he had begun to lose when he was only a college sophomore . That broke the bubble . Richie was not wearing glasses , he saw , and thought : He probably has contacts now  --  he would . He hated those glasses . The tee-shirts and cord pants he 'd habitually worn had been replaced by a suit that had n't been purchased off any rack  --  Bill estimated that he was looking at nine hundred dollars ' worth of tailor-made on the hoof . Beverly Marsh ( if her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of the casual pony-tail , her hair  --  which was almost exactly the same shade his own had been  --  spilled over the shoulders of her plain white Ship ' n Shore blouse in a torrent of subdued color . In this dim light it merely glowed like a well-banked bed of embers . In daylight , even the light of such a subdued day as this one , Bill imagined it would flame . And he found himself wondering what it would feel like to plunge his handsp487into that hair . The world 's oldest story , he thought wryly . I love my wife but oh you kid . Eddie  --  it was weird but true  --  had grown up to look quite a little bit like Anthony Perkins . His face was prematurely lined ( although in his movements he seemed somehow younger than either Richie or Ben ) and made older still by the rimless spectacles he wore  --  spectacles you would imagine a British barrister wearing as he approached the bench or leafed through a legal brief . His hair was short , worn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late fifties and early sixties . He was wearing a loud checked sportcoat that looked like something grabbed from the Distress Sale rack of a men 's clothing store that would shortly be out of business . but the watch on one wrist was a Patek Philippe , and the ring on the little finger of his right hand was a ruby . The stone was too hugely vulgar and too ostentatious to be anything but real . Ben was the one who had really changed , and , looking at him again , Bill felt unreality wash easily over him . His face was the same , and his hair , although graying and longer , was combed in the same unusual right-side part . But Ben had gotten thin . He sat easily enough in his chair , his unadorned leather vest open to show the blue chambray work-shirt beneath . He wore Levi 's with straight legs , cowboy boots , and a wide belt with a beaten-silver buckle . These clothes clung easily to a body which was slim and narrowhipped . He wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links but copper ones . He got thin , Bill thought . He 's a shadow of his former self , so to speak . . . . Ole Ben got thin . Wonders never cease . There was a moment of silence among the six of them that was beyond description . It was one of the strangest moments Bill Denbroughever passed in his life . Stan was not here , but a seventh had come , nonetheless . Here in this private restaurant dining room Bill felt its presence so fully that it was almost personified  --  but not as an old man in a white robe with a scythe on his shoulder . It was the white spot on the map which lay between 1958 and 1985 , an area an explorer might have called the Great Do n't Know . Bill wondered what exactly was there . Beverly Marsh in a short skirt which showed most of her long , coltish legs , a Beverly Marsh in white go-go boots , her hair parted in the middle and ironed ? Richie Tozier carrying a sign which said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPUS on the other ? Ben Hanscom in a yellowp488hard-hat with a flag decal on the front , running a bulldozer under a canvas parasol , his shirt off , showing a stomach which protruded less and less over the waistband of his pants ? Was this seventh creature black ? No relation to either H. Rap Brown or Grandmaster Flash , not this fellow , this fellow wore plain white shirts and fadeinto-the-woodworkJ . C. Penney slacks , and he sat in a library carrell at the University of Maine , writing papers on the origin of footnotes and the possible advantages of ISBN numbers in book cataloguing while the marchers marched outside and Phil Ochs sang " Richard Nixon find yourself another country to be part of " and men died with their stomachs blown out for villages whose names they could not pronounce ; he sat there studiously bent over his work ( Bill saw him ) , which lay in a slant of crisp white winterlight , his face sober and absorbed , knowing that to be a librarian was to come as close as any human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . Was he the seventh ? Or was it a young man standing before his mirror , looking at the way his forehead was growing , looking at a combful of pulled-out red hairs , looking at a pile of university notebooks on the desk reflected in the mirror , notebooks which held the completed , messy first draft of a novel entitled Joanna , which would be published a year later ? Some of the above , all of the above , none of the above . It did n't matter , really . The seventh was there , and in that one moment they all felt it . . . and perhaps understood best the dreadful power of the thing that had brought them back . It lives , Bill thought , cold inside his clothes . Eye of newt , tail of dragon , Hand of Glory . . . whatever It was , It 's here again , in Derry . It . And he felt suddenly that It was the seventh ; that It and time were somehow interchangeable , that It wore all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had terrified and killed . . . and the idea that It might be them was somehow the most frightening idea of all . How much of us was left behind here ? he thought with sudden rising terror . How much of us never left the drains and the sewers where It lived . . . and where It fed ? Is that why we forgot ? Because part of each of us never had any future , never grew , never left Derry ? Is that why ? He saw no answers on their faces . . . only his own questions reflected back at him . Thoughts form and pass in a matter of seconds or milliseconds , and create their own time-frames , and all of this passed throughp489Bill Denbrough 's mind in a space of no more than five seconds . Then Richie Tozier , leaning back against the wall , grinned again and said : " Oh my , look at this  --  Bill Denbrough went for the chrome dome look . How long you been Turtle Waxing your head , Big Bill ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come out , opened his mouth and heard himself say : " Fuck you and the horse you rode in on , Trashmouth . " There was a moment of silence  --  and then the room exploded with laughter . Bill crossed to them and began to shake hands , and while there was something horrible in what he now felt , there was also something comforting about it : this sensation of having come home for good. 3Ben Hanscom Gets SkinnyMike Hanlon ordered drinks , and as if to make up for the prior silence , everyone began to talk at once . Beverly Marsh was now Beverly Rogan , it turned out . She said she was married to a wonderful man in Chicago who had turned her whole life around and who had , by some benign magic , been able to transform his wife 's simple talent for sewing into a successful dress business . Eddie Kaspbrak owned a limousine company in New York . " For all I know , my wife could be in bed with Al Pacino right now , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knew what Bill and Ben had been up to , but Bill had a peculiar sense that there had been no personal association of their names  --  Ben as an architect , himself as a writer  --  with people they had known as children until very , very recently . Beverly had paperbackcopies of Joanna and The Black Rapids in her purse , and asked him if he would sign them . Bill did so , noticing as he did that both books were in mint condition  --  as if they had been purchased in the airport newsstand as she got off the plane . In like fashion , Richie told Ben how much he had admired the BBC communications center in London . . . but there was a puzzled sort of light in his eyes , as if he could not quite reconcile that building with this man . . . or with the fat earnest boy who hadp490showed them how to flood out half the Barrens with scrounged boards and a rusty car door . Richie was a disc jockey in California . He told them he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill groaned . " God , Richie , your Voices were always so terrible . " " Flattery will get you nowhere , mawster , " Richie replied loftily . When Beverly asked him if he wore contacts now , Richie said in a low voice , " Come a little closer , bay-bee . Look in my eyes . " Beverly did , and exclaimed delightedly as Richie tilted his head a little so she could see the lower rims of the Hydromist soft lenses he wore . " Is the library still the same ? " Ben asked Mike Hanlon . Mike took out his wallet and produced a snap of the library , taken from above . He did it with the proud air of a man producing snapshots of his kids when asked about his family . " Guy in a light plane took this , " he said , as the picture went from hand to hand . " I 've been trying to get either the City Council or some well-heeled private donor to supply enough cash to get it blown up to mural size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap . But it 's a good picture , huh ? " They all agreed that it was . Ben held it longest , looking at it fixedly . Finally he tapped the glass corridor which connected the two buildings . " Do you recognize this from anywhere else , Mike ? " Mike smiled . " It 's your communications center , " he said , and all six of them burst out laughing . The drinks came . They sat down . That silence , sudden , awkward , and perplexing , fell again . They looked at each other . " Well ? " Beverly asked in her sweet , slightly husky voice . " What do we drink to ? " " To us , " Richie said suddenly . And now he was n't smiling . His eyes caught Bill 's and with a force so great he could barely deal with it , Bill remembered himself and Richie in the middle of NeiboltStreet , after the thing which might have been a clown or which might have been a werewolf had disappeared , embracing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his hand was trembling , and some of his drink spilled on the napery . Richie rose slowly to his feet , and one by one the others followed suit : Bill first , then Ben and Eddie , Beverly , and finally Mike Han/ion . " To us , " Richie said , and like Bill 's hand , his voice trembled a little . " To the Losers ' Club of 1958 . " " The Losers , " Beverly said , slightly amused . " The Losers , " Eddie said . His face was pale and old behind his rimless glasses . " The Losers , " Ben agreed . A faint and painful smile ghosted at the corners of his mouth . " The Losers , " Mike Hanlon said softly . " The Losers , " Bill finished . Their glasses touched . They drank . That silence fell again , and this time Richie did not break it . This time the silence seemed necessary . They sat back down and Bill said , " So spill it , Mike . Tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " Eat first , " Mike said . " We 'll talk afterward . " So they ate . . . and they ate long and well . Like that old joke about the condemned man , Bill thought , but his own appetite was better than it had : been in ages . . . since he was a kid , he was tempted to think . The food was not stunningly good , but it was far from bad , and there was a lot of it . The six of them began trading stuff back and forth  --  spareribs , moo goo gai pan , chicken wings that had been delicately braised , egg rolls , water chestnuts wrapped in bacon , strips of beef that had been threaded onto wooden skewers . They began with pu-pu platters , and Richie made a childish but amusing business of broiling a little bit of everything over the flamingpot in the center of the platter he was sharing with Beverly  --  including half an egg roll and a few red kidney beans . " Flambe at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd eat shit on a shingle if it was flambe at my table . " " And probably has , " Bill remarked . Beverly laughed so hard at this she had to spit a mouthful of food into her napkin . " Oh God , I think I 'm gon na ralph , " Richie said in an eerily exact imitation of Don Pardo , and Beverly laughed harder , blushing a bright red . " Stop it , Richie , " she said . " I 'm warning you . " " The warning is taken , " Richie said . " Eat well , dear . " Rose herself brought them their dessert  --  a great mound of bakedAlaska which she ignited at the head of the table , where Mike sat . " More flambe at my table , " Richie said in the voice of a man whop492has died and gone to heaven . " This may be the best meal I 've ever eaten in my life . " " But of course , " Rose said demurely . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked her . " At Jade of the Orient , all wishes are granted , sir . " Richie 's smile faltered suddenly . " I applaud the sentiment , " he said , " hut you know , I really doubt the veracity . " They almost demolished the baked Alaska . As Bill sat back , his belly straining the waistband of his pants , he happened to notice the glasses on the table . There seemed to be hundreds of them . He grinned a little , realizing that he himself had sunk two martinis before the meal and God knew how many bottles of Kirin beer with it . The others had done about as well . In their state , fried chunks of bowling pin would probably have tasted okay . And yet he did n't feel drunk . " I have n't eaten like that since I was a kid , " Ben said . They looked at him and a faint flush of color tinged his cheeks . " I mean it literally . That may be the biggest meal I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You went on a diet ? " Eddie asked . " Yeah , " Ben said . " I did . The Ben Hanscom Freedom Diet . " " What got you going ? " Richie asked . " You do n't want to hear all that ancient history . . . . " Ben shifted uncomfortably . " I do n't know about the rest of them , " Bill said , " but I do . Come on , Ben . Give . What turned Haystack Calhoun into the magazine model we see before us today ? " Richie snorted a little . " Haystack , right . I 'd forgotten that . " " It 's not much of a story , " Ben said . " No story at all , really . After that summer  --  after 1958  --  we stayed in Derry another two years . Then my mom lost her job and we ended up moving to Nebraska , because she had a sister there who offered to take us in until my mother got on her feet again . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a miserly bitch who had to keep telling you what your place in the great scheme of things was , how lucky we were that my mom had a sister who could give us charity , how lucky we were not to be on welfare , all that sort of thing . I was so fat I disgusted her . She could n't leave it alone . Ben , you ought to get more exercise . Ben , you 'll have a heart attack before you 're forty if you do n't lose weight . Ben , with little children starving in the world ,  |p493you  ought to be ashamed of yourself . ' " He paused for a moment and sipped some water . " The thing was , she also trotted the starving children out if I did n't clean my plate . " Richie laughed and nodded . " Anyway , the country was just pulling out of a recession and my mother was almost a year finding steady work . By the time we moved out of Aunt Jean 's place in La Vista and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ninety pounds over when you guys knew me . I think I put on most of it just to spite my aunt Jean . " Eddie whistled . " That would have put you at about  --  " " At about two hundred and ten , " Ben said gravely . " Anyway , I was going to East Side High School in Omaha , and the phys ed periods were . . . well , pretty bad . The other kids called me Jugs . That ought to give you the idea . " The ragging went on for about seven months , and then one day , while we were getting dressed in the locker room after the period , two or three of the guys started to . . . to kind of slap my gut . They called it fat-paddling . ' Pretty soon two or three others got in on it . Then four or five more . Pretty soon it was all of them , chasing me around the locker room and up the hall , whacking my gut , my butt , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scream . That made the rest of them laugh like crazy . " You know , " he said , looking down and carefully rearranging his silverware , " that 's the last time I can remember thinking of Henry Bowers until Mike called me two days ago . The kid who started it was a farmboy with these big old hands , and while they were chasing after me I remember thinking that Henry had come back . I think  --  no , I know  --  that 's when I panicked . " They chased me up the hall past the lockers where the guys who played sports kept their stuff . I was naked and red as a lobster . I 'd lost any sense of dignity or . . . or of myself , I guess you 'd say . Where myself was . I was screaming for help . And here they came after me , screaming Fat paddling ! Fat paddling ! Fat paddling ! ' There was a bench  --  " " Ben , you do n't have to put yourself through this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She toyed with her waterglass , and almost spilled it . " Let him finish , " Bill said . Ben looked at him for a moment and then nodded . " There wasp494a bench at the end of the corridor . I fell over it and hit my head . They were all around me in another minute or two , and then this voice said : ' Okay . That 's enough . You guys go change up . ' " It was ( : oath , standing there in the doorway , wearing his blue sweatpants with the white stripe up the sides and his white teeshirt . There was no way of telling how long he 'd been standing there . They all looked at him , some of them grinning , some of them guilty , some of them just looking sort of vacant . They went away . And I burst into tears . " Coach just stood there in the doorway leading back to the gym , watching me , watching this naked fat boy with his skin all red from the fat-paddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And finally he said , Benny , why do n't you just fucking shut up ? ' " It shocked me so much to hear a teacher use that word that I did . I looked up at him , and he came over and sat down on the bench I 'd fallen over . He leaned over me , and the whistle around his neck swung out and bonked me on the forehead . For a second I thought he was going to kiss me or something , and I shrank back from him , but what he did was grab one of my tits in each hand and squeeze . Then he took his hands away and rubbed them on his pants like he 'd touched something dirty . " You think I 'm going to comfort you ? ' he asked me . I 'm not . You disgust them and you disgust me as well . We got different reasons , but that 's because they 're kids and I 'm not . They do n't know why you disgust them . I do know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God gave you in a great big mess of fat . It 's a lot of stupid self-indulgence , and it makes me want to puke . Now listen to me , Benny , because this is the only time I 'm going to say it to you . I got a football team to coach , and basketball , and track , and somewhere in between I 've got swimming team . So I 'll just say it once . You 're fat up here . ' And he tapped my forehead right where his damned whistle had bonked me . That 's where everybody 's fat . You put what 's between your ears on a diet and you 're going to lose weight . But guys like you never do . ' " " What a bastard ! " Beverly said indignantly . " Yeah , " Ben said , grinning . " But he did n't know he was a bastard , that 's how dumb he was . He 'd probably seen Jack Webb in that movie The D.I . about sixty times , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , he was . Because I thought of something right then . I thought ... " He looked away , frowning  --  and Bill had the strangest feeling that he knew what Ben was going to say before he said it . " I told you that the last time I can remember thinking of Henry Bowers was when the other boys were chasing after me and fatpaddling . Well , when the Coach was getting up to go , that was the last time I really thought of what we 'd done in the summer of ' 58 . I thought  --  " He hesitated again , looking at each of them in turn , seeming to search their faces . He went on carefully . " I thought of how good we were together . I thought of what we did and how we did it , and all at once it hit me that if Coach had to face anything like that , his hair would probably have turned white all at once and his heart would have stopped dead in his chest like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had n't been fair to me . What happened was simple enough  --  " " You got mad , " Bill said . Ben smiled . " Yeah , that 's right , " he said . " I called , Coach ! ' " He turned around and looked at me . You say you coach track ? ' I asked him . " That 's right , ' he said . Not that it 's anything to you . ' " You listen to me , you stupid stone-brained son of a bitch , ' I said , and his mouth dropped open and his eyes bugged out . I ' 11 be out there for the track team in March . What do you think about that ? ' " I think you better shut your mouth before it gets you into big trouble , ' he said . " I 'm going to run down everyone you get out , ' I said . I 'm going to run down your best . And then I want a fucking apology from you . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was going to come back in there and let me have it . Then they unclenched again . You just keep talking , fatboy , ' he said softly . You got the motormouth . But the day you can outrun my best will be the day I quit this place and go back to picking corn on the circuit . ' And he left . " " You lost the weight ? " Richie asked . " Well , I did , " Ben said . " But Coach was wrong . It did n't start in my head . It started with my mother . I went home that night andp496told her I wanted to lose some weight . We ended up having a hell of a fight , both of us crying . She started out with that same old song and dance : I was n't really fat , I just had big bones , and a big boy who was going to be a big man had to eat big just to stay even . It was a . . . a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary for her , trying to raise a boy on her own . She had no education and no real skills , just a willingness to work hard . And when she could give me a second helping . . . or when she could look across the table at me and see that I was looking solid ... " " She felt like she was winning the battle , " Mike said . " Uh-huh . " Ben drank off the last of his beer and wiped a small mustache of foam off his upper lip with the heel of his hand . " So the biggest fight was n't with my head ; it was with her . She just would n't accept it , not for months . She would n't take in my clothes and she would n't buy me new ones . I was running by then , I ran everywhere , and sometimes my heart pounded so hard I felt like I was going to pass out . The first of my mile runs I finished by puking and then fainting . Then for awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my pants while I ran . " I got a paper-route and I ran with the bag around my neck , bouncing against my chest , while I held up my pants . My shirts started to look like sails . And nights when I went home and would only eat half the stuff on my plate my mother would burst into tears and say that I was starving myself , killing myself , that I did n't love her anymore , that I did n't care about how hard she had worked for me . " " Christ , " Richie muttered , lighting a cigarette . " I do n't know how you handled it , Ben . " " I just kept the Coach 's face in front of me , " Ben said . " I just kept remembering the way he looked after he grabbed my tits in the hallway to the boys ' locker room that time . That 's how I did it . I got myself some new jeans and stuff with the paper-route money , and the old guy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my belt  --  about five of them , as I remember . I think that I might have remembered the other time I had to buy a pair of new jeans  --  that was when Henry pushed me into the Barrensthat day and they just about got torn off my body . " " Yeah , " Eddie said , grinning . " And you told me about the chocolatemilk . Remember that ? "  |p497Ben  nodded . " If I did remember , " he went on , " it was just for a second  --  there and gone . About that same time I started taking Health and Nutrition at school , and I found out you could eat just about all the raw green stuff you wanted and not gain weight . So one night my mother put on a salad with lettuce and raw spinach in it , chunks of apple and maybe a little leftover ham . Now I 've never liked rabbit-food that much , but I had three helpings and just raved on and on to my mother about how good it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . She did n't care so much what I ate as long as I ate a lot of it . She buried me in salads . I ate them for the next three years . There were times when I had to look in the mirror to make sure my nose was n't wriggling . " " So what happened about the Coach ? " Eddie asked . " Did you go out for track ? " He touched his aspirator , as if the thought of running had reminded him of it . " Oh yeah , I went out , " Ben said . " The two-twenty and the fourforty . By then I 'd lost seventy pounds and I 'd sprung up two inches so that what was left was better distributed . On the first day of trials I won the two-twenty by six lengths and the four-forty by eight . Then I went over to Coach , who looked mad enough to chew nails and spit out staples , and I said : Looks like it 's time you got out on the circuit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? ' " " He did n't say a thing at first  --  just swung a roundhouse and knocked me flat on my back . Then he told me to get off the field . Said he did n't want a smartmouth bastard like me on his track team . " I would n't be on it if President Kennedy appointed me to it , ' I said , wiping blood out of the corner of my mouth . And since you got me going I wo n't hold you to it ... but the next time you sit down to a big plate of corn on the cob , spare me a thought . ' " He told me if I did n't get out right then he was going to beat the living crap out of me . " Ben was smiling a little . . . but there was nothing very pleasant about that smile , certainly nothing nostalgic . " Those were his exact words . Everyone was watching us , including the kids I 'd beaten . They looked pretty embarrassed . So I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach . You get one free , on account of you 're a sore loser but too old to learn any better now . But you put one more on me and I 'll try to see to it that you lose your job.  |p498I  'm not sure I can do it , but I can make a good try . I lost the weight so I could have a little dignity and a little peace . Those are things worth fighting for . ' " Bill said , " All of that sounds wonderful , Ben ... but the writer in me wonders it any kid ever really talked like that . " Ben nodded , still smiling that peculiar smile . " I doubt if any kid who had n't been through the things we went through ever did , " he said . " But I said them ... and I meant them . " Bill thought about this and then nodded . " All right . " " The Coach stood back with his hands on the hips of his sweatpants , " Ben said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody said anything . I walked off , and that was the last I had to do with Coach Woodleigh . When my home-room teacher handed me my course sheet for my junior year , someone had typed the word excused next to phys. ed. and he 'd initialed it . " " You beat him ! " Richie exclaimed , and shook his clenched hands over his head . " Way to go , Ben ! " Ben shrugged . " I think what I did was beat part of myself . Coach got me going , I guess . . . but it was thinking of you guys that made me really believe that I could do it . And I did do it . " Ben shrugged charmingly , but Bill believed he could see fine drops of sweat at his hairline . " End of True Confessions . Except I sure could use another beer . Talking 's thirsty work . " Mike signalled the waitress . All six of them ended up ordering another round , and they talked of light matters until the drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the bubbles crawled up the sides of the glass . He was both amused and appalled to realize he was hoping someone else would begin to story about the years between  --  that Beverly would tell them about the wonderful man she had married ( even if he was boring , as most wonderful men were ) , or that Richie Tozier would begin to expound on Funny Incidents in the Broadcasting Studio , or that Eddie Kaspbrak would tell them what Teddy Kennedywas really like , how much Robert Redford tipped . . . or maybe offer some insights into why Ben had been able to give up the extra pounds while he had needed to hang onto his aspirator . The fact is , Bill thought , Mike is going to start talking any minute now , and I 'm not sure I want to hear what he has to say . The fact is , my heart is beating just a little too fast and my hands are just a little too cold . The fact is , I 'm just about twenty-five years too old to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone . Let 's talk of careers and spouses and what it 's like to look at your old playmates and realize that you 've taken a few really good shots in the nose from time itself Let 's talk about sex , baseball , the price of gas , the future of the Warsaw Pact nations . Anything but what we came here to talk about . So say something , somebody . Someone did . Eddie Kaspbrak did . But it was not what Teddy Kennedy was really like or how much Redford tipped or even why he had found it necessary to keep what Richie had sometimes called " Eddie 's lung-sucker " in the old days . He asked Mike when Stan Uris had died . " The night before last . When I made the calls . " " Did it have to do with . . . with why we 're here ? " " I could beg the question and say that , since he did n't leave a note , no one can know for sure , " Mike answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think the assumptionis safe enough . " " He killed himself , did n't he ? " Beverly said dully . " Oh God  --  poor Stan . " The others were looking at Mike , who finished his drink and said : " He committed suicide , yes . Apparently went up to the bathroomshortly after I called him , drew a bath , got into it , and cut his wrists . " Bill looked down the table , which seemed suddenly lined with shocked , pale faces  --  no bodies , only those faces , like white circles . Like white balloons , moon balloons , tethered here by an old promisethat should have long since lapsed . " How did you find out ? " Richie asked . " Was it carried in the papers up here ? " " No . For some time now I 've subscribed to the newspapers of those towns closest to all of you . I have kept tabs over the years . " " I Spy . " Richie 's face was sour . " Thanks , Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " Poor Stan , " Beverly repeated . She seemed stunned , unable to cope with the news . " But he was so brave back then . So . . . determined . " " People change , " Eddie said . " Do they ? " Bill asked . " Stan was  --  " He moved his hands on the tablecloth , trying to catch the right words . " He was an ordered person . The kind of person who has to have his books divided upp500into fiction and nonfiction on his shelves . . . and then wants to have each section in alphabetical order . I can remember something he said once  --  I do n't remember where we were or what we were doing , at least not yet , but I think it was toward the end of things . He said he could stand to be scared , but he hated being dirty . That seemed to me the essence of Stan . Maybe it was just too much , when Mike called . He saw his choices as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean . Maybe people really do n't change as much as we think . Maybe they just . . . maybe they just stiffen up . " There was a moment of silence and then Richie said , " All right , Mike . What 's happening in Derry ? Tell us. " " 1 can tell you some , " Mike said . " I can tell you , for instance , what 's happening now  --  and I can tell you some things about yourselves . But I ca n't tell you everything that happened back in the summer of 1958 , and I do n't believe I 'll ever have to . Eventually you 'll remember it for yourselves . And I think if I told you too much before your minds were ready to remember , what happened to Stan  --  " " Might happen to us ? " Ben asked quietly . Mike nodded . " Yes . That 's exactly what I 'm afraid of . " Bill said : " Then tell us what you can , Mike . " " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Losers Get the Scoop " The murders have started again , " Mike said flatly . He looked up and down the table , and then his eyes fixed on Bill 's . " The first of the new murders '  --  if you 'll allow me that rather grisly conceit  --  began on the Main Street Bridge and ended underneathit . The victim was a gay and rather childlike man named Adrian Mellon . He had a bad case of asthma . " Eddie 's hand stole out and touched the side of his aspirator . " It happened last summer on July 21st , the last night of the Canal Days Festival , which was a kind of celebration , a . . . a ... " " A Derry ritual , " Bill said in a low voice . His long fingers were slowly massaging his temples , and it was not hard to guess he wasp501thinking about his brother George . . . George , who had almost certainly opened the way the last time this had happened . " A ritual , " Mike said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had happened to Adrian Mellon quickly , watching with no pleasure as their eyes got bigger and bigger . He told them what the News had reported and what it had not . . . the latter including the testimony of Don Hagarty and Christopher Unwin about a certain clown which had been under the bridge like the troll in the fabled story of yore , a clown which had looked like a cross between Ronald McDonald and Bozo , according to Hagarty . " It was him , " Ben said in a sick hoarse voice . " It was that fucker Pennywise . " " There 's one other thing , " Mike said , looking at Bill . " One of the investigating officers  --  the one who actually pulled Adrian Mellonout of the Canal  --  was a town cop named Harold Gardener . " " Oh Jesus Christ , " Bill said in a weak teary voice . " Bill ? " Beverly looked at him , then put a hand on his arm . Her voice was full of startled concern . " Bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five then , " Bill said . His stunned eyes searched Mike 's face for confirmation . " Yes . " " What is it , Bill ? " Richie asked . " H-H-Harold Gardener was the s-son of Dave Gardener , " Bill said . " Dave lived down the street from us back then , when George was k-killed . He was the one who got to Juh Juh . . . to my brother first and brought him up to the house , wrapped in a piece of qu-quilt . " They sat silently , saying nothing . Beverly put a hand briefly over her eyes . " It all fits rather too well , does n't it ? " Mike said finally . " Yes , " Bill said in a low voice . " It fits , all right . " " I 'd kept tabs on the six of you over the years , as I said , " Mike went on , " but it was n't until then that I began to understand just why I had been doing it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held off , waiting to see how things would develop . You see , I felt that I had to be absolutely sure before I . . . disturbed your lives . Not ninety percent , not even ninety-five percent . One hundred was all that would do it . " In December of last year , an eight-year-old boy named Stevenp502Johnson was found dead in Memorial Park . Like Adrian Mellon , he had been badly mutilated just before or just after his death , but he looked as if he could have died of just plain fright . " " Sexually assaulted ? " Eddie asked . " No. gust plain mutilated . " " How many in all ? " Eddie asked , not looking as if he really wanted to know . " It 's had , " Mike said . " I low many ? " Bill repeated . " Nine . So far . " " It ca n't be ! " Beverly cried . " I would have read about it in the paper . . . seen it on the news ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock , Maine . . . and those children that were murdered in Atlanta ... " " Yes , that , " Mike said . " I 've thought about that a lot . It 's really the closest correlative to what 's going on here , and Bev 's right : that really was coast-to-coast news . In some ways , the Atlanta comparisonis the thing about all of this that frightens me the most . The murder of nine children . . . we should have TV news correspondentshere , and phony psychics , and reporters from The Atlantic Monthly and Rolling Stone . . . the whole media circus , in short . " " But it has n't happened , " Bill said . " No , " Mike answered , " it has n't . Oh , there was a Sundaysupplementpiece about it in the Portland Sunday Telegram , and another one in the Boston Globe after the last two . A Boston-based television program called Good Day ! did a segment this February on unsolved murders , and one of the experts mentioned the Derry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly gave no indication of knowing there had been a similar batch of murders in 1957-58 , and another in 1929-30 . " There are some ostensible reasons , of course . Atlanta , NewYork , Chicago , Detroit . . . those are big media towns , and in bigmedia towns when something happens it makes a bang . There isn'ta single TV or radio station in Derry , unless you count the littleFM the English and Speech Department runs up at the high school . Bangor 's got the corner on the market when it comes to the media . " " Except for the Derry News , " Eddie said , and they all laughed . " But we all know that does n't really cut it with the way the worldis today . The communication web is there , and at some point thep503story should have broken nationally . But it did n't . And I think the reason is just this : It does n't want it to . " " It , " Bill mused , almost to himself . " It , " Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might as well be what we used to call It . I 've begun to think , you see , that It has been here so long . . . whatever It really is . . . that It 's become a part of Derry , something as much a part of the town as the Standpipe , or the Canal , or Bassey Park , or the library . Only It 's not a matter of outward geography , you understand . Maybe that was true once , but now It 's . . . inside . Somehow It 's gotten inside . That 's the only way I know to understand all of the terrible things that have happened here  --  the nominally explicable as well as the utterly inexplicable . There was a fire at a Negro nightclub called the Black Spot in 1930 . A year before that , a bunch of half-bright Depression outlaws was gunned down on Canal Street in the middle of the afternoon . " " The Bradley Gang , " Bill said . " The FBI got them , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's not precisely true . So far as I 've been able to find out  --  and I 'd give a lot to believe that it was n't so , because I love this town  --  the Bradley Gang , all seven of them , were actually gunned down by the good citizens of Derry . I 'll tell you about it sometime . " There was the explosion at the Kitchener Ironworks during an Easter-egg hunt in 1906 . There was a horrible series of animal mutilations that same year that was finally traced to Andrew Rhulin , the grand-uncle of the man who now runs the Rhulin Farms . He was apparently bludgeoned to death by the three deputies who were supposed to bring him in . None of the deputies were ever brought to trial . " Mike Hanlon produced a small notebook from an inner pocket and paged through it , talking without looking up . " In 1877 there were four lynchings inside the incorporated town limits . One of those that climbed a rope was the lay preacher of the Methodist Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathtub as if they were kittens and then shot his wife in the head . He put the gun in her hand to make it look like suicide , but no one was fooled . A year before that four loggers were found dead in a cabin downstream on the Kenduskeag , literally torn apart . Disappearances of children , of whole families , are recorded in oldp504diary extracts . . . but not in any public document . It goes on and on , but perhaps you get the idea . " " I get the idea , all right , " Ben said . " Something 's going on here , but it 's private . " Mike closed his notebook , replaced it in his inner pocket , and looked at them soberly . " If I were an insurance man instead of a librarian , I 'd draw you a graph , maybe . It would show an unusually high rate of every violent crime we know of , not excluding rape , incest , breaking and entering , auto theft , child abuse , spouse abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas where the violent-crime rate is far below what you 'd expect for a city of its size and mixed racial make-up . The extraordinary placidity of the people who live there has been traced to something in the water . . . a natural trank of some kind . The exact opposite holds true here . Derry is a violent place to live in an ordinary year . But every twenty-seven years  --  although the cycle has never been perfectly exact  --  that violence has escalated to a furious peak . . . and it has never been national news . " You 're saying there 's a cancer at work here , " Beverly said . " Not at all . An untreated cancer invariably kills . Derry has n't died ; on the contrary , it has thrived . . . in an unspectacular , unnewsworthyway , of course . It is simply a fairly prosperous small city in a relatively unpopulous state where bad things happen too often . . . and where ferocious things happen every quarter of a century or so . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike nodded . " All down the line . 1715-16 , 1740 until roughly 1743  --  that must have been a bad one  --  1769-70 , and on and on . Right up to the present time . I have a feeling that it 's been getting steadily worse , maybe because there have been more people in Derry at the end of each cycle , maybe for some other reason , And in 1958 , the cycle appears to have come to a premature end . For which we were responsible . " Bill Denbrough leaned forward , his eyes suddenly bright . " You 're sure of that ? Sure ? " " Yes , " Mike said . " All the other cycles reached their peak around September and then ended in a big way . Life usually took on its more or less normal tenor by Christmas . . . Easter at the latest . In other words , there were bad years ' of fourteen to twenty monthsp505every twenty-seven years . But the bad year that began when your brother was killed in October of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " Eddie asked urgently . His breath had thinned ; Bill remembered that high whistle as Eddie inhaled breath , and knew that he would soon be tooting on the old lung-sucker . " What did we do ? " The question hung there . Mike seemed to regard it . . . and at last he shook his head . " You 'll remember , " he said . " In time you 'll remember . " " What if we do n't ? " Ben asked . " Then God help us all . " " Nine children dead this year , " Rich said . " Christ . " " Lisa Albrecht and Steven Johnson in late 1984 , " Mike said . " In February a boy named Dennis Torrio disappeared . A high-school boy . His body was found in mid-March , in the Barrens . Mutilated . This was nearby . " He took a photograph from the same pocket into which he had replaced the notebook . It made its way around the table . Beverly and Eddie looked at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as if it were hot . " Jesus ! Jesus , Mike ! " He looked up , his eyes wide and shocked . A moment later he passed the picture to Bill . Bill looked at it and felt the world swim into gray tones all around him . For a moment he was sure he would pass out . He heard a groan , and knew he had made the sound . He dropped the picture . " What is it ? " he heard Beverly saying . " What does it mean , Bill ? " " It 's my brother 's school picture , " Bill said at last . " It 's JuhGeorgie . The picture from his album . The one that moved . The one that winked . " They handed it around again then , while Bill sat as still as stone at the head of the table , looking out into space . It was a photograph of a photograph . The picture showed a tattered school photo propped up against a white background  --  smiling lips parted to exhibit twoholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your coffin , Bill thought , and shuddered ) . On the margin below George 's picture were the words SCHOOL FRIENDS 1957-58 . " It was found this year ? " Beverly asked again . Mike nodded and she turned to Bill . " When did you last see it , Bill ? " He wet his lips , tried to speak . Nothing came out . He tried again ,  |p506hearing  the words echo in his head , aware of the stutter coming back , fighting it , fighting the terror . " I have n't seen that picture since 1958 . That spring , the year after George died . When I tried to show it to Richie , it was g-gone . " There was an explosive gasping sound that made them all look around . Eddie was setting his aspirator back on the table and looking slightly embarrassed . " Eddie Kaspbrak blasts off ! " Richie cried cheerfully , and then , suddenly and eerily , the Voice of the MovieTone Newsreel Narratorcame from Rich 's mouth : " Today in Derry , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star of the show is Big Ed the Snothead , known all over New England as  --  " He stopped abruptly , and one hand moved toward his face , as if to cover his eyes , and Bill suddenly thought : No  --  no , that 's not it . Not to cover his eyes but to push his glasses up on his nose . The glasses that are n't even there anymore . Oh dear Christ , what 's going on here ? " Eddie , I 'm sorry , " Rich said . " That was cruel . I do n't know what the hell I was thinking about . " He looked around at the others , bewildered . Mike Hanlon spoke into the silence . " I 'd promised myself after Steven Johnson 's body was discovered that if anything else happened  --  if there was one more clear case  --  I would make the calls that I ended up not making for another two months . It was as if I was hypnotized by what was happening , by . the consciousness of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found by a fallen log less than ten feet from the Torrio boy 's body . It was n't hidden ; quite the contrary . It was as if the killer wanted it to be found . As I 'm sure the killer did . " " How did you get the police photo , Mike ? " Ben asked . " That 's what it is , is n't it ? " " Yes , that 's what it is . There 's a fellow in the Police Department who is n't averse to making a little extra money . I pay him twenty bucks a month  --  all that I can afford . He 's a pipeline . " The body of Dawn Roy was found four days after the Torrio boy . McCarron Park . Thirteen years old . Decapitated . " April 23rd of this year . Adam Terrault . Sixteen . Reported missingwhen he did n't come home from band practice . Found the next day just off the path that runs through the greenbelt behind West Broadway .. Also decapitated.  |p507  " May 6th . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upstairs bathroom , drowned in the toilet . " " Oh , Mike ! " Beverly cried . " Yeah , it 's bad , " he said , almost angrily . " Do n't you think 1 know that ? " " The police are convinced that it could n't have been  --  well , some kind of accident ? " Bev asked . Mike shook his head . " His mother was hanging clothes in the back yard . She heard sounds of a struggle-heard her son screaming . She ran as fast as she could . As she went up the stairs , she says she heard the sound of the toilet flushing repeatedly  --  that , and someone laughing . She said it did n't sound human . " " And she saw nothing at all ? " Eddie asked . " Her son , " Mike said simply . " His back had been broken , his skull fractured . The glass door of the shower-stall was broken . There was blood everywhere . The mother is in the Bangor Mental Health Institute , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's quite lost her mind . " " No fucking wonder , " Richie said hoarsely . " Who 's got a ciga-rette ? " Beverly gave him one . Rich lit it with hands that shook badly . " The police line is that the killer came in through the front door while the Cowan boy 's mother was hanging her clothes in the back yard . Then , when she ran up the back stairs , he supposedly jumped from the bathroom window into the yard she 'd just left and got away clean . But the window is only one of those half-sized jobs ; a kid of seven would have to wriggle to get through it . And the drop was twenty-five feet to a stone-flagged patio . Rademacher does n't like to talk about those things , and no one in the press  --  certainly no one at the News  --  has pressed him about them . " Mike took a drink of water and then passed another picture down the line . This was not a police photograph ; it was another school picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was dressed in his best for the school photo and his hands were clean and folded neatly in his lap . . . but there was a devilish little glint in his eyes . He was black . " Jeffrey Holly , " Mike said . " May 13th . A week after the Cowan boy was killed . Torn open . He was found in Bassey Park , by the Canal.  |p508  " Nine days after that , May 22nd , a fifthgrader named John Feury was found dead out on Neibolt Street  --  " Eddie uttered a high , quavering scream . He groped for his aspiratorand knocked it off the table . It rolled down to Bill , who picked it up . Eddie 's face had gone a sickish yellow color . His breath whistled coldly in his throat . " Get him something to drink ! " Ben roared . " Somebody get him  --  " But Eddie was shaking his head . He triggered the aspirator down his throat . His chest heaved as he tore in a gulp of air . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-closed , panting . " I 'll be all right , " he gasped . " Gim me a minute , I 'm with you . " " Eddie , are you sure ? " Beverly asked . " Maybe you ought to lie down  --  " " I 'll be all right , " he repeated querulously . " It was just . . . the shock . You know . The shock . I 'd forgotten all about Neibolt Street . " No one replied ; no one had to . Bill thought : You believe your capacity has been reached , and then Mike produces another name , and yet another , like a black magician with a hatful of malign tricks , and you 're knocked on your ass again . It was too much to face all at once , this outpouring of inexplicable violence , somehow directly aimed at the six people here  --  or so George 's photograph seemed to suggest . " Both of John Feury 's legs were gone , " Mike continued softly , " but the medical examiner says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seems to have quite literally died of fear . He was found by the postman , who saw a hand sticking out from under the porch  --  " " It was 29 , was n't it ? " Rich said , and Bill looked at him quickly . Rich glanced back at him , nodded slightly , and then looked at Mike again . " Twenty-nine Neibolt Street . " " Oh yes , " Mike said in that same calm voice . " It was number 29 . " He drank more water . " Are you really all right , Eddie ? " Eddie nodded . His breathing had eased . " Rademacher made an arrest the day after Feury 's body was discovered , " Mike said . " There was a front-page editorial in the News that same day , calling for his resignation , incidentally . " " After eight murders ? " Ben said . " Pretty radical of them , would n't you say ? " Beverly wanted to know who had been arrested.  |p509  " A guy who lives in a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town line and into Newport , " Mike said . " Kind of a hermit . Burns scrapwood in his stove , roofed the place with scavenged shingles and hubcaps . Name of Harold Earl . Probably does n't see two hundred dollars in cash money over the course of a year . Someonedriving by saw him standing out in his dooryard , just looking up at the sky , on the day John Feury 's body was discovered . His clothes were covered with blood . " " Then maybe  --  " Rich began hopefully . " He had three butchered deer in his shed , " Mike said . " He 'd been jacking over in Haven . The blood on his clothes was deerblood . Rademacher asked him if he killed John Feury , and Earl is supposed to have said , Oh ayuh , I killed a lot of people . I shot most of them in the war . ' He also said he 'd seen things in the woods at night . Blue lights sometimes , floating just a few inches off the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They sent him up to the Bangor Mental Health . According to the medical report , his liver 's almost entirely gone . He 's been drinkingpaint-thinner  --  " " Oh my God , " Beverly said. "  --  and is prone to hallucinations . They 've been holding on to him , and until three days ago Rademacher was sticking to his idea that Earl was the most likely suspect . He had eight guys out there , digging around his shack and looking for the missing heads , lampshadesmade out of human skin , God knows what . " Mike paused , head lowered , and then went on . His voice was slightly hoarse now . " I 'd held off and held off . But when I saw this last one , I made the calls . I wish to God I 'd made them sooner . " " Let 's see , " Ben said abruptly . " The victim was another fifthgrader , " Mike said . " A classmate of the Feury boy . He was found just off Kansas Street , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Barrens . His name was Jerry Bellwood . He was torn apart . What . . . what was left of him was found at the foot of a cement retaining wall that was put in along most of Kansas Street about twenty years ago to stop the soil erosion . This police photograph of the section of that wall where Bellwood was found was taken less than half an hour after the body was removed . Here . " He passed the picture to Rich Tozier , who looked and passed it on to Beverly . She glanced at it briefly , winced , and passed it onp510to Eddie , who gazed at it long and raptly before handing it on to Ben . Ben passed it to Bill with barely a glance . Printing straggled its way across the concrete retaining wall . It said : COME HOME COME HOME COME HOMEBill looked up at Mike grimly . He had been bewildered and frightened ; now he felt the first stirrings of anger . He was glad . Angry was not such a great way to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the miserable fear . " Is that written in what I think it 's written in ? " " Yes , " Mike said . " Jerry Bellwood 's blood . " Richie Gets BeepedMike had taken his photographs back . He had an idea that Bill might ask for the one of George 's last school picture , but Bill did not . He put them in his inside jacket pocket , and when they were out of sight , all of them  --  Mike included  --  felt a sense of relief . " Nine children , " Beverly was saying softly . " I ca n't believe it . I mean . . . I can believe it , but I ca n't believe it . Nine kids and nothing ? Nothing at all ? " " It 's not quite like that , " Mike said . " People are angry , people are scared . . . or so it seems . It 's really impossible to tell which ones really feel that way and which ones are faking . " " Faking ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man who just folded his newspaper and went inside his house while you were screaming at him for help ? " For a moment something seemed to jump in her eyes and she looked both terrified and aware . Then she only looked puzzled . " No . . . when was that , Mike ? " " Never mind . It will come to you in time . All I can say now is that everything looks the way it should in Derry . Faced with suchp511a grisly string of murders , people are doing all the things you 'd expect them to do , and most of them are the same things that went on while kids were disappearing and getting murdered back in ' 58 . The Save Our Children Committee is meeting again , only this time at Derry Elementary School instead of Derry High . There are sixteendetectives from the State Attorney General 's office in town , and a contingent of FBI agents as well  --  I do n't know how many , and although Rademacher talks big , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect- " " Oh yes . The curfew . " Ben was rubbing the side of his neck slowly and deliberately . " That did wonders back in ' 58 . I remember that much . " "  --  and there are Mothers ' Walker Groups to make sure that every child who goes to school , grades K through eight , is chaperonedhome . The News has gotten over two thousand letters demandinga solution in the last three weeks alone . And , of course , the out-migration has begun again . I sometimes think that 's the only way to really tell who 's sincere about wanting it stopped and who is n't . The really sincere ones get scared and leave . " " People really are leaving ? " Richie asked . " It happens each time the cycle cranks up again . It 's impossible to tell just how many go , because the cycle has n't fallen squarely in a census year since 1850 or so . But it 's a fairish number . They run like kids who just found out the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come home , come home , " Beverly said softly . When she looked up from her hands it was Bill she looked at , not Mike . " It wanted us to come back . Why ? " " It may want us all back , " Mike said a little cryptically . " Sure . It may . It may want revenge . After all , we balked It once before . " " Revenge . . . or just to set things back in order , " Bill said . Mike nodded . " Things are out of order with your own lives , too , you know . None of you left Derry untouched . . . without Its mark on you . All of you forgot what happened here , and your memories of that summer are still only fragmentary . And then there 's the passingly curious fact that you 're all rich . " " Oh , come on now ! " Richie said . " That 's hardly  --  " " Be soft , be soft , " Mike said , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accusing you of anything , just trying to get thep512facts out on the table . You are rich by the standards of a smalltownlibrarian who makes just under eleven grand a year after taxes , okay ? " Rich shrugged the shoulders of his expensive suit uncomfortably . Ben appeared deeply absorbed in tearing small strips from the edge of his napkin . No one was looking directly at Mike except Bill . " None of you are in the H. L. Hunt class , certainly , " Mike said , " hut you are all well-to-do even by the standards of the American upper-middle class . We 're all friends here , so fess up : if there 's one of you who declared less than ninety thousand dollars on his or her 1984 tax return , raise your hand . " They glanced around at each other almost furtively , embarrassed , as Americans always seem to be , by the raw fact of their own success  --  as if cash were hardcooked eggs and affluence the farts that inevitably follow an overdose of same . Bill felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rise . He had been paid ten thousand more than the sum Mike had mentioned just for doing the first draft of the Attic Room screenplay . He had been promised an additional twenty thousand dollars each for two rewrites , if needed . Then there were royalties ... and the hefty advance on a two-book contract just signed . . . how much had he declared on his ' 84 tax return ? Just about eight hundred thousand dollars , right ? Enough , anyway , to seem almost monstrous in light of Mike Hanlon 's stated income of just under eleven thousand a year . So that 's how much they pay you to keep the lighthouse , Mike old kid , Bill thought . Jesus Christ , somewhere along the line you should have asked for a raise ! Mike said : " Bill Denbrough , a successful novelist in a society where there are only a few novelists and fewer still lucky enough to be making a living from the craft . Beverly Rogan , who 's in the rag trade , a field to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , the most sought-after designer in the middle third of the country right now . " " Oh , it 's not me , " Beverly said . She uttered a nervous little laugh and lit a fresh cigarette from the smoldering stub of the old one . " It 's Tom . Tom 's the one . Without him I 'd still be relining skirts and sewing up hems . I do n't have any business sense at all , even Tom says so . It 's just . . . you know , Tom . And luck . " She took a single deep drag from her cigarette and then snuffed it . " Methinks the lady doth protest too much , " Richie said slyly.  |p513She  turned quickly in her seat and gave him a hard look , her color high . " Just what 's that supposed to mean , Richie Tozier ? " " Doan hits me , Miz Scawlett ! " Richie cried in a high , trembling Pickaninny Voice  --  and in that moment Bill could see with an eerie clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superseded presence lurking under Rich Tozier 's grownup exterior but a creature almost more real than the man himself . " Doan hits me ! Lemme bring you anothuh mint joolip , Miz Scawlett ! Youse goan drink hit out on de po'ch where it 's be a little bit cooluh ! Doan whup disyere boy ! " " You 're impossible , Richie , " Beverly said coldly . " You ought to grow up . " Richie looked at her , his grin fading slowly into uncertainty . " Until I came back here , " he said , " I thought I had . " " Rich , you may just be the most successful disc jockey in the United States , " Mike said . " You 've certainly got L.A. in the palm of your hand . On top of that there are two syndicated programs , one of them a straight top-forty countdown show , the other one something called The Freaky Forty  --  " " You better watch out , fool , " Richie said in a gruff Mr. T Voice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back change places . I 'll give you brain-surgery with my fist . I 'll  --  " " Eddie , " Mike went on , ignoring Richie , " you 've got a healthy limousine service in a city where you just about have to elbow long black cars out of your way when you cross the street . Two limo companies a week go smash in the Big Apple , but you 're doing fine . " Ben , you 're probably the most successful young architect in the world . " Ben opened his mouth , probably to protest , and then closed it again abruptly . Mike smiled at them , spread his hands . " I do n't want to embarrass anyone , but I do want all the cards on the table . There are people who succeed young , and there are people who succeed in highly specialized jobs  --  if there were n't people who bucked the odds successfully , I guess everybody would give up . If it was just one or two of you , we could pass it off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's all of you , and that includes Stan Uris , who was the most successful young accountant in Atlanta . . . which means in the whole South . My conclusion is that your success stems from what happened here twenty-seven years ago . If you had all beenp514exposed to asbestos at that time and had all developed lung cancer by now , the correlative would be no less clear or persuasive . Do any of you want to dispute it ? " He looked at them . No one answered . " All except you , " Bill said . " What happened to you , Mikey ? " " Is n't it obvious ? " He grinned . " I stayed here . " " You kept the lighthouse , " Ben said . Bill jerked around and looked at him , startled , but Ben was staring hard at Mike and did n't see . " That does n't make me feel so good , Mike . In fact , it makes me feel sort of like a bugturd . " " Amen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have nothing to feel guilty about , any of you . Do you think it was my choice to stay here , any more than it was your choice  --  any of you  --  to leave ? Hell , we were kids . For one reason or another your parents moved away , and you guys were part of the baggage they took along . My parents stayed . And was it really their decision  --  any of them ? I do n't think so . How was it decided who would go and who would stay ? Was it luck ? Fate ? It ? Some Other ? I do n't know . But it was n't us guys . So quit it . " " You 're not . . . not bitter ? " Eddie asked timidly . " I 've been too busy to be bitter , " Mike said . " I 've spent a long time watching and waiting . . . . I was watching and waiting even before I knew it , I think , but for the last five years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert . Since the turn of the year I 've been keeping a journal . And when a man writes , he thinks harder . . . or maybe just more specifically . And one of the things I 've spent time writing and thinking about is the nature of It . It changes ; we know that . I think It also manipulates , and leaves Its marks on people just by the nature of what It is  --  the way you can smell a skunk oti you even after a long bath , if it lets go its bag of scent too near you . The way a grasshopper will spit bugjuice into your palm if you catch it in your hand . " Mike slowly unbuttoned his shirt and spread it wide . They could all see the pinkish scrawls of scar across the smooth brown skin of his chest between the nipples . " The way claws leave scars , " he said . " The werewolf , " Richie almost moaned . " Oh Christ , Big Bill , the werewolf ! When we went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill asked . He sounded like a man called out ( I 11 t , un " What , Richie ? " " Do n't you remember ? " " No . . . do you ? " " I . . . I almost do ... " Looking both confused and scared , Richie subsided . " Are you saying this thing is n't evil ? " Eddie asked Mike abruptly . He was staring at the scars as if hypnotized . " That it 's just some part of the . . . the natural order ? " " It 's no part of a natural order we understand or condone , " Mike said , rebuttoning his shirt , " and I see no reason to operate on any other basis than the one we do understand : that It kills , kills children , and that 's wrong . Bill understood that before any of us . Do you remember , Bill ? " " I remember that I wanted to kill It , " Bill said , and for the first time ( and ever after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own voice . " But I did n't have much of a world-view on the subject , if you see what I mean  --  I just wanted to kill It because It killed George . " " And do you still ? " Bill considered this carefully . He looked down at his spread hands on the table and remembered George in his yellow slicker , his hood up , the paper boat with its thin glaze of paraffin in one hand . He looked up at Mike . " M-M-More than ever , " he said . Mike nodded as if this were exactly what he had expected . " It left Its mark on us . It worked Its will on us , just as It has worked Its will on this whole town , day in and day out , even during those long periods when It is asleep or hibernating or whatever It does between Its more ... more lively periods . " Mike raised one finger . " But if It worked Its will on us , at some point , in some way , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before It was done  --  I know we did . Did we weaken It ? Hurt It ? Did we , in fact , almost kill It ? I think we did . I think we came so close to killing It that we went away thinking we had . " " But you do n't remember that part either , do you ? " Ben asked . " No . I can remember everything up until August 15th 1958 withalmost perfect clarity . But from then until September 4th or so ,  |p516when  school was called in again , everything is a total blank . It is n't murky or hazy ; it is just completely gone . With one exception : I seem to remember Bill screaming about something called the dead-lights . " Bill 's arm jerked convulsively . It struck one of his empty beerbottles , and the bottle shattered on the floor like a bomb . " Did you cut yourself ? " Beverly asked . She had half-risen . " No , " he said . His voice was harsh and dry . His arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had somehow grown ; hecould feel ( the deadlights ) it pressing out against the stretched skin of his face in steady numbing throbs . " I 'll pick up the  --  " " No , just sit down . " He wanted to look at her and could n't . He could n't take his eyes off Mike . " Do you remember the deadlights , Bill ? " Mike asked softly . " No , " he said . His mouth felt the way it did when the dentist got a little too enthusiastic with the novocaine . " You will . " " I hope to God I do n't . " " You will anyway , " Mike said . " But for now . . . no . Not me , either . Do any of you ? " One by one they shook their heads . " But we did something , " Mike said quietly . " At some point we were able to exercise some sort of group will . At some point we achieved some special understanding , whether conscious or unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish Stan was here . I have a feeling that Stan , with his ordered mind , might have had some idea . " " Maybe he did , " Beverly said . " Maybe that 's why he killed himself . Maybe he understood that if there was magic , it would n't work for grownups . " " I think it could , though , " Mike said . " Because there 's one other thing we six have in common . I wonder if any of you have realized what that is . " It was Bill 's turn to open his mouth and then shut it again . " Go on , " Mike said . " You know what it is . I can see it on your face . " " I 'm not sure I know , " Bill replied , " but I think w-we 're all childless . Is that ih-it ? "  |p517There  was a moment of shocked silence . " Yeah , " Mike said . " That 's it . " Jesus Christ Almighty ! " Eddie spoke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the price of beans in Peru ? What gave you the idea that everyone in the world has to have kids ? That 's nuts ! " " Do you and your wife have children ? " Mike asked . " If you 've been keeping track of us all the way you said , then you know goddam well we do n't . But I still say it does n't mean a damn thing . " " Have you tried to have children ? " " We do n't use birth control , if that 's what you mean . " Eddie spoke with an oddly moving dignity , but his cheeks were flushed . " It just so happens that my wife is a little . . . Oh hell . She 's a lot overweight . We went to see a doctor and she told us my wife might never have kids if she did n't lose some weight . Does that make us criminals ? " " Take it easy , Eds , " Richie soothed , and leaned toward him . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cheek ! " he cried , rounding on Richie . " You know I hate that ! I always hated it ! " Richie recoiled , blinking . " Beverly ? " Mike asked . " What about you and Tom ? " " No children , " she said . " Also no birth control . Tom wants kids . . . and so do I , of course , " she added hastily , glancing around at them quickly . Bill thought her eyes seemed overbright , almost the eyes of an actress giving a good performance . " It just has n't happened yet . " " Have you had those tests ? " Ben asked her . " Oh yes , of course , " she said , and uttered a light laugh that was almost a titter . And in one of those leaps of comprehension that sometimes come to people who are gifted with both curiosity and insight , Bill suddenly understood a great deal about Beverly and her husband Tom , alias the Greatest Man in the World . Beverly had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man in the World had refused to entertain even for a moment the notion that there might be something wrong with the sperm being manufacturedin the Sacred Sacs . " What about you and your wife , Big Bill ? " Rich asked . " Been trying ? " They all looked at him curiously . . . because his wife was someone they knew . Audra was by no means the best-known orp518the best-loved actress in the world , but she was certainly part of the celebrity coinage that had somehow replaced talent as a medium of exchange in the latter half of the twentieth century ; there had been a picture of her in People magazine when she cut her hair short , and during a particularly boring stretch in New York ( the play she had been planning to do Off Broadway fell through ) she had done a week-long stint on Hollywood Squares , over her agent 's strenuous objections . She was a stranger whose lovely face was known to them . He thought Beverly looked particularly curious . " We 've been trying off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For the last eight months or so it 's been off , because of the movie we were doing  --  Attic Room , it 's called . " " You know , we run a little entertainment syndie every day from five-fifteen in the afternoon until five-thirty , " Richie said . " Seein ' Stars , it 's called . They had a feature on that damned movie just last week  --  Husband and Wife Working Happily Together kind of thing . They said both of your names and I never made the connection . Funny , is n't it ? " " Very , " Bill said . " Anyway , Audra said it would be just our luck if she caught pregnant while we were in preproduction and she had to do ten weeks of strenuous acting and being morning-sick at the same time . But we want kids , yes . And we 've tried quite hard . " " Had fertility tests ? " Ben asked . " Uh-huh . Four years ago , in New York . The doctors discovered a very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a lucky thing because , although it would n't have prevented her from getting pregnant , it might have caused a tubal pregnancy . She and I are both fertile , though . " Eddie repeated stubbornly , " It does n't prove a goddam thing . " " Suggestive , though , " Ben murmured . " No little accidents on your front , Ben ? " Bill asked . He was shocked and amused to find that his mouth had very nearly called Ben Haystack instead . " I 've never been married , I 've always been careful , and there have been no paternity suits , " Ben said . " Beyond that I do n't think there 's any real way of telling . " " You want to hear a funny story ? " Richie asked . He was smiling , but there was no smile in his eyes . " Sure , " Bill said . " You were always good at the funny stuff , Richie. "  |p519  " Your face and me own buttocks , boyo , " Richie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Irish Cop 's Voice . You 've improved out of all measure , Richie , Bill thought . As a kid , you could n't do an /rid ) Cop no matter how you busted your brains . Except once ... or twice . . . when ( the deadlights ) was that ? " Your face and me own buttocks ; just keep rememb'rin that com-pay-ri-son , me foine bucko . " Ben Hanscom suddenly held his nose and cried in a high quaveringboyish voice : " Beep-beep , Richie ! Beep-beep ! Beep-beep ! " After a moment , laughing , Eddie held his own nose and joined in . Beverly did the same . " Awright ! Awright ! " Richie cried , laughing himself . " Awright , I give up ! Chrissake ! " " Oh man , " Eddie said . He collapsed back in his chair , laughing so hard he was almost crying . " We gotcha that time , Trashmouth . Way to go , Ben . " Ben was smiling but he looked a little bewildered . " Beep-beep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about that . We always used to beep you , Richie . " " You guys never appreciated true talent , that 's all , " Richie said comfortably . As in the old days , you could knock him off-balance , but he was like one of those inflatable Joe Palooka dolls with sand in the base  --  he floated upright again almost at once . " That was one of your little contributions to the Losers ' Club , was n't it , Haystack ? " " Yeah , I guess it was . " " What a man ! " Richie said in a trembling , awestruck voice and then began to salaam over the table , nearly sticking his nose in his tea-cup each time he went down . " What a man ! Oh chillun , what a man ! " " Beep-beep , Richie , " Ben said solemnly , and then exploded laughter in a hearty baritone utterly unlike his wavering childhood voice . " You 're the same old roadrunner . " " You guys want to hear this story or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal one way or the other . Beep away if you want to . I can take abuse . I mean , you 're looking at a man who once did an interview with Ozzy Osbourne . " " Tell it , " Bill said . He glanced over at Mike and saw that Mike looked happier  --  or more at rest  --  since the luncheon had begun.  |p520Was  it because he saw the almost unconscious knitting-together that was happening , the sort of easy falling-back into old roles that almost never happened when old chums got together ? Bill thought so . And he thought , If there are certain preconditions for the belief in magic that makes it possible to use the magic , then maybe those preconditionswill inevitably arrange themselves . It was not a very comforting thought . It made him feel like a man strapped to the nosecone of a guided missile . Beep-beep indeed . " Well , " Richie was saying , " I could make this long and sad or I could give you the Blondie and Dagwood comic-strip version , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I moved out to California I met a girl , and we fell pretty hard for each other . Started living together . She was on the pill at first , but it made her feel sick almost all the time . She talked about getting an IUD , but I was n't too crazy about that  --  the first stories about how they might not be completely safe were just starting to come out in the papers . " We had talked a lot about kids , and had pretty well decided we did n't want them even if we decided to legalize the relationship . Irresponsible to bring kids into such a shitty , dangerous , overpopulatedworld . . . and blah-blah-blah , babble-babble-babble , let 's go out and put a bomb in the men 's room of the Bank of America and then come on back to the crashpad and smoke some dope and talk about the difference between Maoism and Trotskyism , if you see what I mean . " Or maybe I 'm being too hard on both of us . Shit , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got my wires cut , as the Beverly Hills crowd puts it with their unfailing vulgar chic . The operation went with no problem and I had no adverse aftereffects . There can be , you know . I had a friend whose balls swelled up to roughly the size of the tires on a 1959 Cadillac . I was gon na give him a pair of suspenders and a couple of barrels for his birthday  --  sort of a designer truss  --  but they went down before then . " " All put with your customary tact and dignity , " Bill remarked , and Beverly began to laugh again . Richie offered a large , sincere smile . " Thank you , Bill , for those words of support . The word fuck ' was used two hundred and six times in your last book . I counted . " " Beep-beep , Trashmouth , " Bill said solemnly , and they all laughed.  |p521Bill  found it nearly impossible to believe they had been talking about dead children less than ten minutes ago . " Press onward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " " Sandy and I lived together for two and a half years , " Richie went on . " Came really close to getting married twice . As things turned out , I guess we saved ourselves a lot of heartache and all that community-property bullshit by keeping it simple . She got an offer to join a corporate law-firm in Washington around the same time I got an offer to come to KLAD as a weekend jock  --  not much , but a foot in the door . She told me it was her big chance and I had to be the most insensitive male chauvinist oinker in the United States to be dragging my feet , and furthermore she 'd had it with California anyway . I told her I also had a chance . So we thrashed it out , and we trashed each other out , and at the end of all the thrashing and trashing Sandy went . " About a year after that I decided to try and get the vasectomy reversed . No real reason for it , and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty spotty , but I thought what the hell . " " You were seeing someone steadily then ? " Bill asked . " No  --  that 's the funny part of it , " Richie said , frowning . " I just woke up one day with this . . . I du n no , this hobbyhorse about getting it reversed . " " You must have been nuts , " Eddie said . " General anesthetic instead of a local ? Surgery ? Maybe a week in the hospital after-ward ? " " Yeah , the doctor told me all of that stuff , " Richie replied . " And I told him I wanted to go ahead anyway . I do n't know why . The doc asked me if I understood the aftermath of the operation was sure to be painful while the result was only going to be a coin-toss at best . I said I did . He said okay , and I asked him when  --  my attitude being the sooner the better , you know . So he says hold your horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get a sperm sample just to make sure the reversal operation is necessary . I said , Come on , I had the exam after the vasectomy . It worked . ' He told me that sometimes the vasa reconnected spontaneously . Yo mamma ! ' I says . Nobody ever told me that . ' He said the chances were very small  --  infinitesimal , really  --  but because the operation was so serious , we ought to check it out . So I popped into the men 's room with a Frederick 's of Hollywood catalogue and jerked off into a Dixie cup  --  "  |p522  " Beep-beep , Richie , " Beverly said . " Yeah , you 're right , " Richie said . " The part about the Frederick 's catalogue is a lie  --  you never find anything that good in a doctor 's office . Anyway , the doc called me three days later and asked me which I wanted first , the good news or the bad news . " ' Gim me the good news first , ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be necessary , ' he said . ' The had news is that anybody you 've been to bed with over the last two or three years could hit you with a paternity suit pretty much at will . ' " ' Are you saying what I think you 're saying ? ' I asked him . " ' I 'm telling you that you are n't shooting blanks and have n't been for quite awhile now , ' he said . ' Millions of little wigglies in your sperm sample . Your days of going gaily in bareback with no questions asked have temporarily come to an end , Richard . ' " I thanked him and hung up . Then I called Sandy in Washington . " ' Rich ! ' she says to me , " and Richie 's voice suddenly became the voice of this girl Sandy whom none of them had ever met . It was not an imitation or even a likeness , exactly ; it was more like an auditory painting . " ' It 's great to hear from you ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , ' I said . ' You should have let me know . I would have sent you a blender . ' " She goes , ' Same old Richie , always full of gags . ' " So I said ' Sure , same old Richie , always full of gags . By the way , Sandy , you did n't happen to have a kid or anything after you left L.A. , did you ? Or maybe an unscheduled d and c , or something ? ' " ' That gag is n't so funny , Rich , ' she said , and I had a brainwave that she was getting ready to hang up on me , so I told her what happened . She started laughing , only this time it was real hard  --  she was laughing the way I always used to laugh with you guys , like somebody had told her the world 's biggest bellybuster . So when she finally starts slowing down I ask her what in God 's name is funny . ' It 's just so wonderful , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . After all these years the joke is finally on Records Tozier . How many bastards have you sired since I came east , Rich ? ' " ' I take it that means you still have n't experienced the joys of motherhood ? ' I ask her . " ' I 'm due in July , ' she says . ' Were there any more questions ? ' " ' Yeah , ' I go . ' When did you change your mind about the immoralityof bringing children into such a shitty world ? '  |p523  " When I finally met a man who was n't a shit , ' she answers , and hangs up . " Bill began to laugh . He laughed until tears rolled down his checks . " Yeah , " Richie said . " I think she cut it off quick so she 'd really get the last word , but she could have hung on the line all day . I know when I 've been aced . I went back to the doctor a week later and asked him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of spontaneous regeneration . He said he 'd talked with some of his colleagues about the matter . It turned out that in the three-year period 1980-82 , the California branch of the AMA logged twenty-three reports of spontaneous regeneration . Six of those turned out to be simply botched operations . Six others were either hoaxes or cons  --  guys looking to take a bite out of some doctor 's bank account . So . . . eleven real ones in three years . " " Eleven out of how many ? " Beverly asked . " Twenty-eight thousand six hundred and eighteen , " Richie said calmly . Silence around the table . " So I went and beat Irish Sweepstakes odds , " Richie said , " and still no kid to show for it . That give you any good chucks , Eds ? " Eddie began stubbornly : " It still does n't prove  --  " " No , " Bill said , " it does n't prove a thing . But it certainly suggests a link . The question is , what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 've thought about it , sure , " Mike said , " but it was impossible to decide anything until you all got together again and talked , the way you 've been doing . There was no way I could predict how this reunion would go until it actually happened . " He paused for a long time , looking thoughtfully at them . " I 've got one idea , " he said , " but before I tell you what it is , I think we have to agree on whether or not we have business to do here . Do we want to try again to do what we tried to do once before ? Do we want to try to kill It again ? Or do we just divide the check up six ways and go back to what we were doing ? " " It seems as if  --  " Beverly began , but Mike shook his head at her . He was n't done . " You have to understand that our chances of success are impossible to predict . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have been a little better if Stan was here , too . Still not real good , but better . With Stan gone , the circle we made that day is broken.  |p524I  do n't really think we can destroy It , or even send It away for a little while , as we did before , with a broken circle . I think It will kill us , one by one by one , and probably in some extremely horrible ways . As children we made a complete circle in some way I to try to form a smaller circle . I do n't know if that can be done . I believe it might be possible to think we 'd done it , only to discover  --  when it was too late  --  well . . . that it was too late . " Mike regarded them again , eyes sunken and tired in his brown face . " So I think we need to take a vote . Stay and try it again , or go home . Those are the choices . I got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even sure you 'd remember , but I ca n't hold you here on the strength of that promise . The results of that would be worse and more of it . " He looked at Bill , and in that moment Bill understood what was coming . He dreaded it , was helpless to stop it , and then , with the same feeling of relief he imagined must come to a suicide when he takes his hands off the wheel of the speeding car and simply uses them to cover his eyes , he accepted it . Mike had gotten them here , Mike had laid it all neatly out for them . . . and now he was relinquishingthe mantle of leadership . He intended that mantle to go back to the person who had worn it in 1958 . " What do you say , Big Bill ? Call the question . " " Before I do , " Bill said , " d-does everyone understand the question ? You were going to say something , Bev . " She shook her head . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay and fight or do we forget the whole thing ? Those in favor of staying ? " No one at the table moved at all for perhaps five seconds , and Bill was reminded of auctions he had attended where the price on an item suddenly soared into the stratosphere and those who did n't want to bid anymore almost literally played statues ; one was afraid to scratch an itch or wave a fly off the end of one 's nose for fear the auctioneer would take it for another five grand or twenty-five . Bill thought of Georgie , Georgie who had meant no one any harm , who had only wanted to get out of the house after being cooped up all week , Georgie with his color high , his newspaper boat in one hand , snapping the buckles of his yellow rainslicker with the other , Georgie thanking him ... and then bending over and kissing Bill 's fever-heated cheek : Thanks , Bill . It 's a neat boat.  |p525He  felt the old rage rise in him , but he was older now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . A horrid slew of names marched through his head : Betty Ripsom , found frozen into the ground , Cheryl Lamonica , fished out of the Kenduskeag , Matthew Clements , torn from his tricycle , Veronica Grogan , nine years old and found in a sewer , Steven Johnson , Lisa Albrecht , all the others , and God only knew how many of the missing . He raised his hand slowly and said , " Let 's kill It . This time let 's really kill It . " For a moment his hand hung there alone , like the hand of the only kid in class who knows the right answer , the one all the other kids hate . Then Richie sighed , raised his own hand , and said : " What the hell . It ca n't be any worse than interviewing Ozzy Osbourne . " Beverly raised her hand . Her color was back now , but in hectic patches that flared along her cheekbones . She looked both tremendouslyexcited and scared to death . Mike raised his hand . Ben raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking as if he wished he could actually melt into it and thus disappear . His face , thin and delicate-looking , was miserably afraid as he looked first right and then left and then back to Bill . For a moment Bill felt sure Eddie was simply going to push back his chair , rise , and bolt from the room without looking back . Then he raised one hand in the air and grasped his aspirator tightly in the other . " Way to go , Eds , " Richie said . " We 're really gon na have ourselves some chucks this time , I bet . " " Beep-beep , Richie , " Eddie said in a wavering voice . The Losers Get Dessert " So what 's your one idea , Mike ? " Bill asked . The mood had been broken by Rose , the hostess , who had come in with a dish of fortune cookies . She looked around at the six people who had their hands in the air with a carefully polite lack of curiosity . They lowered them hastily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's simple enough , " Mike said , " but it might be pretty damn dangerous , too . "  |p526  " Spill it , " Richie said . " I think we ought to split up for the rest of the day . I think each of us ought to go hack to the place in Derry he or she remembers best . . . outside the Barrens , that is . I do n't think any of us should go there  --  not yet . Think of it as a series of walking-tours , if you like . " " What 's the purpose , Mike ? " Ben asked . " I 'm not entirely sure . You have to understand that I 'm going pretty much on intuition here  --  " " But this has got a good beat and you can dance to it , " Richie said . The others smiled . Mike did not ; he nodded instead . " That 's as good a way of putting it as any . Going on intuition is like picking up a beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for grownups to do , and that 's the main reason I think it might be the right thing for us to do . Kids , after all , operate on it about eighty percent of the time , at least until they 're fourteen or so . " " You 're talking about plugging back into the situation , " Eddie said . " I suppose so . Anyway , that 's my idea . If no specific place to go comes to you , just follow your feet and see where they take you . Then we meet tonight , at the library , and talk over what happened . " " If anything happens , " Ben said . " Oh , I think things will . " " What sort of things ? " Bill asked . Mike shook his head . " I have no idea . I think whatever happens is apt to be unpleasant . I think it 's even possible that one of us may not turn up at the library tonight . No reason for thinking that .. . except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why alone ? " Beverly asked finally . " If we 're supposed to do this as a group , why do you want us to start alone , Mike ? Especially if the risk really turns out to be as high as you think it might be ? " " I think I can answer that , " Bill said . " Go ahead , Bill , " Mike said . " It started alone for each of us , " Bill said to Beverly . " I do n't remember everything  --  not yet  --  but I sure remember that much . The picture in George 's room that moved . Ben 's mummy . The leper that Eddie saw under the porch on Neibolt Street . Mike finding the blood on the grass near the Canal in Bassey Park . And thep527bird . . . there was something about a bird , was n't there , Mike ? " Mike nodded grimly . " A big bird . " " Yes , but not as friendly as the one on Sesame Street . " Richie cackled wildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good One ! Oh chillun , is we blessed or is we blessed ! " " Beep-beep , Richie , " Mike said , and Richie subsided . " For you it was the voice from the pipe and the blood that came out of the drain , " Bill said to Beverly . " And for Richie ... " But here he paused , puzzled . " I must be the exception that proves the rule , Big Bill , " Richie said . " The first time I came in contact with anything that summer that was weird  --  I mean really big-league weird  --  was in George 's room , with you . When you and I went back to your house that day and looked at his photo album . The picture of Center Street by the Canal started to move . Do you remember ? " " Yes , " Bill said . " But are you sure there was nothing before that , Richie ? Nothing at all ? " " I  --  " Something flickered in Richie 's eyes . He said slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends chased me  --  before the end of school , this was , and I got away from them in the toy departmentof Freese 's . I went up by City Center and sat down on a park bench for awhile and I thought I saw ... but that was just something I dreamed . " " What was it ? " Beverly asked . " Nothing , " Richie said , almost brusquely . " A dream . Really . " He looked at Mike . " I do n't mind taking a walk , though . It 'll kill the afternoon . Views of the old homestead . " " So we 're agreed ? " Bill asked . They nodded . " And we 'll meet at the library tonight at ... when do you suggest , Mike ? " " Seven o'clock . Ring the bell if you 're late . The libe closes at seven on weekdays until summer vacation starts for the kids . " " Seven it is , " Bill said , and let his eyes range soberly over them . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us really knows what we 're d-d-doing . Think of this as reconnaissance . If you should see something , do n't fight . Run . " " I 'm a lover , not a fighter , " Richie said in a dreamy Michael Jackson Voice.  |p528  " Well , if we 're going to do it , we ought to get going , " Ben said . A small smile pulled up the left corner of his mouth . It was more bitter than amused . " Although I 'll be damned if I could tell you right this minute where I 'm going to go , if the Barrens are out . That was the best of it for me  --  going down there with you guys . " His eyes moved to Beverly , held there for a moment , moved away . " I ca n't think of anyplace else that means very much to me . Probably I 'll just wander around for a couple of hours , looking at buildings and getting wet feet . " " You 'll find a place to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old food-stops and gas up . " Ben laughed . " My capacity 's gone down a lot since I was eleven . I 'm so full you guys may just have to roll me out of here . " " Well , I 'm all set , " Eddie said . " Wait a sec ! " Beverly cried as they began to push back from their chairs . " The fortune cookies ! Do n't forget those ! " " Yeah , " Richie said . " I can see mine now . YOU WILL SOON BE EATEN UP BY A LARGE MONSTER . HAVE A NICE DAY . " They laughed and Mike passed the little bowl of fortune cookies to Richie , who took one and then sent it on around the table . Bill noticed that no one opened his or her cookie until each had one ; they sat with the little hat-shaped cookies either in front of them or held in their hands , and even as Beverly , still smiling , picked hers up , Bill felt a cry rising in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's part of it , put it back , do n't open it ! But it was too late . Beverly had broken hers open , Ben was doing the same to his , Eddie was cutting into his with the edge of his fork , and just before Beverly 's smile turned to a grimace of horror Bill had time to think : We knew , somehow we knew , because no one simply bit into his or her fortune cookie . That would have been the normal thing to do , but no one did it . Somehow , some part of us still remembers . . . everything . And he found that insensate underknowledge somehow the most horrifying realization of all ; it spoke more eloquently than Mike could have about how surely and deeply It had touched each one of them . . . and how Its touch was still upon them . Blood spurted up from Beverly 's fortune cookie as if from a slashed artery . It splashed across her hand and then gouted onto the white napery which covered the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then spread out in grasping pink fingers.
