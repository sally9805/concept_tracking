if care about people , " says Baltimore 's Mayor William Donald Schaefer . " I I know that sounds silly . " It does not sound the least bit silly to his constituents . In the worst and best of times since he was first elected ten years ago , the balding , portly ( 5 ft. 9 in. , 186 Ibs. ) executive has doggedly fought city hall sloth , inefficiency , arrogance and red tape . He believes that the city 's neighborhoods , with their rich ethnic mix , are Baltimore 's greatest asset . He has extracted some $55 million for housing and development beyond the city 's federally mandated entitlements of about $240 million from Washington ; the ninth largest U.S. municipality , Baltimore is the nation 's third biggest recipient of federal Urban Development Action Grants . <P> Schaefer 's weapons have been gall , soft soap , hard nose , demonic energy and the kind of showmanship Baltimore had not seen since the death of vaudeville . During a crippling 1974 strike by municipal workers , Hizzoner was out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Aquarium failed to open by the July 4 deadline he had guaranteed , Willie Don , as they call him , demonstrated his contrition by plunging into the seal pool ( temperature 79 ) in striped Victorian swimsuit and straw boater , clutching a yellow rubber duck ( he is also affectionately known as Donald Duck ) . His penitential immersion was shared by a voluptuous model done up as a mermaid . Since he was the target of an assassination attempt by a deranged citizen in 1976 , Schaefer has been dogged by security guards ; his daily delight is to shake them . <P> It is a truism in Baltimore that the mayor is married to his city . A bachelor at 59 , he lives with his mother , Tululu , 87 , in the same West Side house where he was born . He got his law degree at the University of Baltimore . <P> Apart from three years as an Army hospital administrator in Europe during World War II , he has hardly ever left his home town . After a week of 18-hr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhoods in a 1975 Pontiac , furiously jotting " Mayor 's Action Memos " about the potholes here , the garbage pileups there , a blanked-out street light in between . <P> They get action on Monday , or else . <P> Even when he departs on his annual one-week vacation in nearby Ocean City , he lugs boxes of official business . <P> A staunch Democrat who worked his way up through 19 years as a city councilman ( he was council president for four years ) , Schaefer is a master at circumventing city hall bureaucracy . He has managed to push through major ventures like the Inner Harbor redevelopment and the subway now abuilding , by creating a series of quasi-public commissions . On every major civic commitment he has sought direct approval from the voters by referendum ; he won all but one of them .
