Under the pilot program , which housing experts said was the first such effort by a state , the Department of Housing will buy or assist in the purchase of at least 500 condominiums at what the state ' s Housing Commissioner , John F. Papandrea , said he hoped would be " sacrifice prices. " // Mr. Papandrea said that the purchases would be spread among cities and suburbs across the state and that one goal in deciding which condominiums to buy was to try to foster the mixing of residents ' income levels. // Department officials also stressed that while the program is not intended as a plan for helping real-estate developers , some of whom are struggling financially with hundreds of unsold units , or to push affordable housing into communities that have resisted , it is likely to produce both of those effects . They said the availability of good deals in a bad market is the driving force. // About $50 million has tentatively been set aside for the program , said William L. Wheeler , a spokesman for the Housing Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 for many of the apartments. // " We ' re looking for bargains , " Mr. Wheeler said . " It ' s a buyers ' market , and we ' re trying to take advantage by getting as much bang for the buck as we can. " // Housing experts said that while other states and municipalities have bought apartments or homes at various times to house the poor , Connecticut ' s decision to exploit a depressed housing market by aggressively entering the market itself has apparently not been done before on any large scale . <> <> Some Prices Down by 20% // Housing officials here who have tried to encourage developers and communities to build affordable housing by offering financial incentives , said the idea of buying condominiums outright was first considered about six months ago and became more and more attractive as the market continued to decline. // In some areas of the state , condominium prices have dropped by 20 percent or more in just the last year , and Housing Department officials said they believed Connecticut would ultimately end up spending less through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Hartford area alone , real-estate agents said , 2 , 600 condominium units are listed for sale. // " I see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , " Mr. Papandrea said . " If the bargains really are present , we could come in well below actual construction costs . " <> <> Independent Panel // But for communities , developers , owners and would-be condominium residents across the state , the implications of the program clearly go beyond costs . With huge potential profits and losses at stake , for example , department officials said they would create an independent panel outside the agency to study proposals , make recommendations and insulate the department from charges of political favoritism. // Similarly , the rules will also prevent the new owners - mostly nonprofit groups financed by the state - from taking windfall profits when the market turns around. // Some potentially sensitive decisions concern where the condominiums will be . Although Mr. Papandrea and other state officials said the goal is to spread the purchases throughout the state , they said the pressure to get as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more units in the lower price range . <> <> Effects Expected to Vary // In Connecticut that probably means fewer purchases in Fairfield County , where real-estate prices are among the highest in the country . Stamford , for example , has 800 condominiums listed for sale , with an average price of $180 , 000 , according to the Stamford Board of Realtors. // In Waterbury , by contrast , about 750 units are for sale , ranging in price from $49 , 900 to $199 , 900 , and there is only one unit at that highest price , said Linda A. Fercodini , president of the Greater Waterbury Board of Realtors. // The effects of the program on the market will vary from town to town , real-estate agents and builders said , and would depend on how widely the purchases were distributed . The acting executive director of the Homebuilders Association of Connecticut , Janet Sitty , said she thought the program " might work both ways " in affecting condominium prices. // She said if owners compete for participation in the program , prices could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreasing the surplus - would ultimately benefit both current owners and the industry. // Under the plans , condominium owners will have to apply to the state by Feb. 23 to participate and must file joint applications with a specific nonprofit organization that will act as the formal buyer using state bond money distributed by the Housing Department . State banking and housing officials will then make recommendations , with the final selections made by the state housing commissioner. // State housing officials outside Connecticut and trade-industry officials in Washington said that although some states , including Massachusetts , have recently begun taking over foreclosed properties to use for affordable housing , taking the initiative before foreclosure will give Connecticut greater flexibility in arranging its purchases . Mr. Papandrea said that in some cases it might be possible for the state to act much as a broker by putting an owner in touch with a nonprofit group and a prospective buyer. // According to the rules for filing that were released today by the Housing Department , families with incomes at or below 100 percent of an area ' s median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while families earning 135 percent or less of the area ' s median will be eligible to apply for those offered for sale . <> <> Rules to Be Developed // In the Stamford area , for example , the median income for a family of four is $64 , 800 , the state ' s highest . That means a family of four could earn $87 , 075 and still qualify to buy a condominium . Procedures for applications to rent or buy apartments will be developed by the Housing Department after the number and location of the apartments has been decided . Rental and purchase arrangements will vary . Statewide , no reliable figures were available about how many condominium apartments are for sale , but real-estate agents said that in some areas there are fewer on the market than there were a year ago . In Stamford , for example , the market bottomed out in the fall of 1988 with about 1 , 200 units for sale out of a total stock of 10 , 000 , said Thomas I. Purcell , president of the local Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan as a means of increasing affordable housing , said he believed the state might have caught on to the extent of the glut through the condominium auctions that have been held in the state over the last six months . He said that at the most recent sale , about three weeks ago , about 1 , 000 apartments were offered for sale around the state but only a dozen were sold. //
