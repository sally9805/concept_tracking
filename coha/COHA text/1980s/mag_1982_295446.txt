After 115 years , Ottawa gets its own constitution <P> With Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau at her side and 30,000 rain-soaked Canadians looking on , Queen Elizabeth II stood on a huge wooden platform outside the massive limestone buildings atop Ottawa 's Parliament Hill . Though the Queen had visited Canada ten times before , this trip was unlike any other . She had left her country as it stood on the-brink of war in the South Atlantic . And her purpose was to preside over a ceremony in which Britain relinquished an arcane but important vestige of its control over the onetime colony . As the Queen signed the proclamation of the Constitution Act 1982 , Canada after 115 years finally obtained its own constitution . <P> The ceremony ended decades of political wrangling that had left the country drained and weary . It was a victory for Trudeau , who since 1971 had sought to gain authority over the basic document governing Canada 's federal system , the British North America ( B.N.A. ) Act of 1867 . Although Canadians have enjoyed self-rule since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians could not agree on a formula for amending it . The British have routinely passed amendments adopted in Ottawa , but the necessity of going to Westminster has long rankled Canadians . <P> Appended to the document is another Trudeau project , a charter of rights , which guarantees Canada 's citizens freedom of speech , religion and assembly . It also prohibits discrimination according to race or sex , and grants English-and French-speaking parents the right to educate their children , where numbers warrant , in their own language . <P> One of Trudeau 's chief goals in seeking a home-grown constitution was to strengthen Canada 's relatively weak central government . That was precisely why he faced stubborn opposition from the country 's ten provincial premiers , who retain primary control over natural resources , education and health . To secure the premiers ' agreement , Trudeau was forced to compromise on several important points , including an amendment formula requiring approval by seven provinces comprising 50% of Canada 's population . <P> Even so , Trudeau was able to bring around only nine provincial leaders . Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau 's compromise because it eliminated Quebec 's traditional veto , which it has used to guard control over such sensitive matters as culture and education . <P> Levesque is still fighting . In a fiery speech last week , he called the Constitution Act a " most pernicious document " that would " systematically isolate " Quebec . In fact , polls show that only 32% of Quebeckers back his stand , while 48% feel he should have approved the new constitution . Levesque boycotted the ceremony in Ottawa , but French-and English-speaking members of Quebec 's opposition Liberal Party attended . An anticonstitution demonstration organized by his Parti Quebecois in Montreal drew 25,000 marchers . <P> The constitution that came home from London still leaves Canada 's main institutional problem unresolved : how to share power between Ottawa and the ten provincial governments . Though most Canadians feel it is time to move on to other questions , including the country 's pressing economic problems , the federal-provincial issue will inevitably continue to complicate Canada 's political life .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
