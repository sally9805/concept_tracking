" Now when I talk , state officials listen , and that ' s nice for a small community in upstate New York , " said Susan Hammond , the 32-year-old Mayor of this city of 17 , 500 people. // Mayor Hammond spoke as she toured 55 acres of recently annexed land that will become Gloversville ' s new industrial park . And her new resonance can be attributed to the community ' s designation last year as one of the state ' s Economic Development Opportunity Zones . The selection guarantees almost $100 , 000 in state grants and a variety of tax credits , low-interest loans and utility discounts for businesses that relocate , expand or reinvest in the Gloversville zone. // In addition , Governor Cuomo has ordered every state department , from Environmental Conservation to Social Services , to be more attentive to the needs of Gloversville and the 18 other zone communities , from Niagara Falls and Lackawanna in the west to Islip , L.I. , in the east . <> <> An Acceleration of Progress // " Our working tactic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise , to quickly realize benefits that otherwise would involve a slower process , " Mr. Cuomo said in a telephone interview. // State officials have proclaimed the zone program a success , saying it has brought pledges of about $114 million in private investment and created 2 , 315 jobs . But questions remain about whether the state is paying for jobs that would have been created without any assistance. // " Many of our companies were in the process of expanding anyway , " said George Schanzenbacher , operating officer of the Cattaraugus Economic Development Zone in Olean. // But one of the clear successes has been here , about 60 miles northwest of Albany . In July , Gloversville , with intense help from state economic development agencies , won selection over Pittsfield , Mass. , as the site of an $11 million golf ball factory for the Spalding and Evenflo Companies of Chicopee , Mass. // " If the State of Massachusetts had a comparable concept of economic development zones , Pittsfield could have edged out Gloversville , " said Donald R. Senecal , controller of Spalding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right financial package , might have made the difference. " #152 Businesses Have Qualified Since July 1987 , when the zone program began , 152 businesses have been certified as eligible for the economic incentives , according to state figures. // To secure the $114 million in private investment , New York has spent about $2. 1 million for grants to the 19 zones . In addition , state agencies have channeled close to $12 million in low-interest , long-term loans to the zone companies. // " We ' ve done better than we expected , " said Vincent Tese , the New York Commissioner of Economic Development . " Like anything else , we expected our learning curve to be fairly slow , but the local governments have really looked at the zones as a way to increase their profiles and their job base. " // While others echo Mr. Tese , the program ' s ultimate success or failure is likely to depend on whether the state can deliver on its promises and whether it can be proven that the money the state has spent has indeed been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 152 certified businesses are new to their communities ; most instead are expansions of companies already in the zone . ( Except in New York City , companies can not qualify for zone benefits by relocating their factories or offices from another community . ) Focus on Existing Businesses " Our primary emphasis has been on certifying existing companies within the zone , " said Mr. Schanzenbacher of Olean . " Our feeling is that if it can help local business , in the long run it may be successful in bringing in other businesses as well. " // While some may question why the state is providing tax credits to companies that were already planning to expand , officials say that many of these companies would once have taken their expansions out of New York State. // " You can have an economic expansion , sure , but these companies would have been expanding outside of New York , " Mr. Tese said. // Economic development experts agree that New York ' s zone program - patterned after others throughout the country - could encourage business growth. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining industry , " said William Goldsmith , a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University . <> <> Solid Economy Needed // But Dr. Goldsmith and other experts said development zone programs would not work well without the cooperation of a robust economy - which New York now has. // " What is required is a change in the national economy that drives up employment and provides the stimulus that is needed for businesses to expand and open shops , " Dr. Goldsmith said. // Gloversville , clearly , has benefited from New York ' s renaissance . For decades , its leather industry was losing business to overseas companies - one year saw the loss of seven companies , each employing several hundred people . The jobless rate soared , peaking at 20 percent. // But in the last several years , companies have begun to move back to Gloversville , steadily dropping the unemployment rate to its current level of about 10 percent . Now local officials look to the steadily growing zone program to " keep the momentum going , " said Robert A. McNary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation. // More than half the new industrial park has been committed to new businesses . " Once we got the word out , " Mayor Hammond said , " we ' ve really been able to roll along . " <> <> A Community Effort // With the help of state officials , Gloversville has also started a program to spruce up the city ' s downtown strip . A job training program for residents of the area , many of whom are on public assistance , has also begun . The YWCA is planning to open a day-care center to provide infant and after-school care for zone employees . And officials have started going door to door to tell residents about the emerging job opportunities. // The aim of the social programs is not only to help businesses by providing a more productive work force but to improve the fortunes of the area ' s poor , " We seek to restore the strength , renew the vibrancy , realize again the opportunity in areas that once were strong , rather than see it wasted by disinterest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength that is renewable.
