In a cramped and crowded Dallas courtroom last week , Federal District Judge Harold Barefoot Sanders Jr . listened patiently as volleys of charges and countercharges flew between lawyers for the Placid Oil Co. and its creditor banks . On the surface , the squabble over corporate bankruptcy seemed mundane . In fact , the rancorous debate was anything but routine . For Placid is not just any oil company . It is the crown jewel of the financial empire built by the legendary Texan H.L. Hunt and ruled today by his beleaguered sons and heirs . Behind the legal posturing was nothing less than a desperate struggle to save the remnants of one of America 's most fabled fortunes . <P> In what could be a serious blow to the Hunt clan , the craggy-faced Barefoot Sanders ruled that Placid must shift its petition for bankruptcy relief from a New Orleans court to Dallas . The banks wanted the case to be heard in Dallas , in Sanders ' jurisdiction , but the Hunts hoped to avoid the judge . Sanders , a liberal Democrat who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conservative Republican Hunts . The Hunts may fear that having Sanders on the case could hurt their chances of holding on to what is left of their dwindling assets , which have been devastated by the deep slump in the oil market . <P> In 1980 the three Hunt brothers who are the principal heirs of Papa H.L.  --  Nelson Bunker , now 60 , William Herbert , 57 , and Lamar , 54  --  estimated their combined net worth to be between $5 billion and $6 billion . Last August they admitted that their fortune had fallen to about $2 billion . Since then , oil prices have plunged more than 50% , and it is now difficult to say what all those idle Hunt rigs and energy reserves are worth . The brothers still have many millions stashed in personal holdings  --  from bank accounts to racehorses and rare coins  --  but they may no longer be able to call themselves billionaires . Says Harry Hurt III , author of the Hunt biography Texas Rich : " This has got to be one of the monumental financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of the Rockefellers putting one of their companies into bankruptcy . " <P> When Placid Oil filed for Chapter 11 protection two weeks ago , the company listed debts of $979.3 million against assets of $2.05 billion . The move was a last-resort effort to prevent the company 's 23 lenders , including Houston 's Texas Commerce Bank and RepublicBank of Dallas , from foreclosing on such Hunt assets as oil and gas leases and real estate . Thus the banks and the Hunts are now battling for control of the family 's remaining wealth . <P> In ruling that the Hunts must move their bankruptcy case to Dallas , Judge Sanders said that since the majority of the Hunt creditors are based in Texas , their claims should be heard in that state . Jerry Jones , a lawyer for the banks , had earlier argued that " we do not want to be charging around the United States to collect our debts . " Some observers speculate that the Hunts may have wanted their case to be heard in a New Orleans court because they believed they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , . deny that charge . Their lawyers maintain that Placid filed for bankruptcy in Louisiana because most of the company 's assets were located there .
