WASHINGTON  --  The Supreme Court said the Internal Revenue Service can ' t limit the tax deduction for depleted oil resources to the value of the oil , if any , actually produced in a particular tax year . In a 5-4 ruling , the high court said independent holders of all oil and gas leases may take the oil depletion deduction for cash bonuses and advance royalty payments they received by permitting others to search for and produce oil on their property . The high court said the depletion deduction could be taken even if no oil or gas were produced in that tax year , or if the level of production were lower than the bonus or advance royalty . The court said such bonuses or royalties are advance payments on oil to be produced later and should be treated like oil income . If no oil ever is produced from a lease , any deductions taken would have to be repaid . The IRS argued in two separate cases that the depletion deduction was available only to the extent that oil and gas were actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were produced , according to the IRS view , no one would be allowed an oil depletion deduction in that tax year . But in an opinion written by Justice Sandra O ' Connor , the high court said the IRS view was an " unreasonable " interpretation of the law . The law , the oil depletion allowance , once permitted all producers of natural gas and oil to deduct part of gross revenue from oil production as a way of recovering some of their investment in producing natural resources . In 1975 , amid public outrage over increasing oil company profits in the wake of the Arab oil embargo , Congress repealed the depletion deduction for major oil companies and retained it only for independent holders of oil properties . In interpreting the 1975 amendments , Justice O ' Connor wrote that Congress " plainly . . . intended to encourage independent producers . . . to explore and develop the nation ' s domestic oil and gas deposits . " She said the IRS position " would discourage these small producers . " In one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advance royalty payment of $7 , 600 in 1975 from other parties that he permitted to explore for oil and natural gas . Although no oil was found or produced that year , the holder of the leases claimed a depletion allowance on his tax returns to cover part of the $7 , 600 . The IRS rejected the deduction , but a federal appeals court in Chicago said the agency was wrong . The IRS appealed to the Supreme Court . In the other case , two owners of land in Texas received a cash bonus from oil exploration companies to which they gave leases . In 1976 , one of the men received a bonus of $528 , 271 and the other got $257 , 653 . Both men claimed depletion deductions that the IRS disallowed on grounds they were in excess of the oil produced that year . The Court of Claims , which has since become the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , said the two weren ' t entitled to the deduction . The landowners appealed to the high court . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The IRS had told the justices that there were 18 other cases , with more than $2. 5 million at stake , pending in court or administrative proceedings involving the same issue . Justice Harry Blackmun dissented , joined by Justices William Brennan , Byron White and Thurgood Marshall . They said the IRS view was " reasonable " and that the majority was " reading its own conception of desirable federal tax policy " into the law .
