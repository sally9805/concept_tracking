The letters of famous people are most interesting if you read between the lines . I RECENTLY heard a scandalous story about an academic , a political scientist whose specialty is civil liberties , who has been opening and read-ing his colleagues ' mail . What , one wonders , does he expect to find therein ? Invitations , offers , deals ? Yearnings , dark secrets , details of quotidian life ? Passions , conspiracies , confessions ? A great many things besides , all of which are none of his damn business ? The thought of this man rifling through other people 's letters is extremely unpleasant . Yet , when for a moment I relax my distaste for him , I recognize that between him and me there is chiefly this difference ? I wait until they are dead to read other people 's mail . Voyeurism by hindsight may be a part of my love for reading letters , but only a small part . The let-ters of interesting men and women not only satisfy the itch of biographical curiosity ; they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the more in-teresting a one in being the only unconscious art form literature allows . Because of this unconscious element ? only in rare instances does the author of the letter think he is creating a work of art ? letters can reveal character in a way that diaries and jour-nals and more self-conscious forms do not . Al-though she would have hated to hear it , Flannery O'Connor 's letters ( published in a collection edited by Sally Fitzgerald and entitled The Habit of Be-ing ) may outlive her novels and short stories . Some-times a writer is radically different in his letters from his diaries . Evelyn Waugh ( " Evalin Wow , " in the pronunciation used by Flannery O'Connor 's mothJoseph Epstein is the editor of the American Scholar . er ) is depressing in his Diaries ; in his Letters he is entertaining , winning , a pussycat . Well . not always or altogether a pussycat . Toward the end of World War II , in a letter to his wife , Waugh wrote : Darling Laura , sweet whiskers , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated 19 December received today , so eagerly expected , was a bitter disappointment . Do realize that a letter need not be a bald chronicle of events ; 1 know you lead a dull life now , my heart bleeds for it , though believe you could make it more interesting if you had the will . But that is no reason to make your letters as dull as your life . I simply am not interested in Bridget 's children . Do grasp that . A letter should be a form of conversation ; write as though you were talking to me . One winces at the thought of receiving such a letter but wonders about the letter ? " dated 19 December received today " ? that occasioned it . A bad letter from a beloved is a dampening thing . Fine syntax may never have won fair lady , yet a letter strewn with solecisms , cliches , dreary dullness can cause the heart of a fastidious lover to beat much more slowly . One wants in a letter from someone one loves wit , passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other qualities are required to confirm one 's own splendid instincts in matters of the heart . Excellent love letters are magnificent to receive but excruciatingly difficult to write , precisely because so much is riding on them . The best that I have ever written were to women I had never seen . 51 This took place while I was in the army , where , as a scribbling man , I sometimes played Cyrano , without aid of balcony or long nose , by writing love letters to the wives and girlfriends of barracks mates whose long suit was not belles lettres . Whether my work as a professional letter writer , and epistolaro , was responsible for binding up or breaking down relationships I never learned . I saw in the writing of those letters the opportunity to exercise my neo ? phyte craft , to aid my fellows in arms , and in a time of peace to serve my country . Of love letters , then , I can say from my brief and slightly irregular experience that I would rather write them than read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love letters . Cornell University Press has recently issued The Love Letters of William and Mary Wordsworth. * Sticky stuff , these letters turn out to be , narrowly connubial in their range of interests , vesuvial in the unrelenting flow of their expressions of affection . " 0 My William ! " writes Mary , " it is not in my power to tell thee how I have been affected by this dearest of all letters ? it was so unexpected ? so new a thing to see the breathing of thy inmost heart upon paper that I was quite overpowered . . .

To which William responds , " 0 my blessing , how happy was I in learning that my letter had moved thee so deeply , and thy delight in reading had if possible been more exquisite than mine in writing . . .

But then they were called Romantics , were n't they ? No one ever called Gustave Flaubert a Romantic . He was , I believe , a great letter writer but of a special kind : a man who writes highly interesting letters while himself remaining consistently unattractive . And nowhere is Flaubert less attractive than on the subjects of sex and love , on which his letters might bring a blush to the wrinkled cheeks of an octogenarian Istanbul procuress . Coarse does not begin to describe Flaubert . Of an evening with a prostitute , he writes to a friend that " I fired four rounds with her . " To Louise Colet , his mistress , he closes an early letter with his characteristically heavy-breathing passion : S Adieu , I seal my letter . This is the hour when , alone amidst everything that sleeps , I open the drawer that holds my treasures . I look at your slippers , your handkerchief , your hair , your portrait , 1 reread your letters and breathe their musky perfume .

D ECLARATIONS of love in letters not addressed to oneself tend to be unseemly , boring , slightly discomfiting , like witnessing an aged couple necking . I would rather read a man making an epistolary appeal for a loan than declaring his love . And there has been no lettristic shortage of loan requests . The young Benjamin Disraeli , in the first of two volumes of his letters recently published by the University of Toronto Press , * puts the touch on very neatly when , in writirw , to his friend Benjamin Austen , he closes : " If you refuse me , the remembrance of past favors will not alter my feelings towards you , but I candidly declare that the injury which it will occasion me , will , tho ' 1 hope not irreparable , be very great .

" If you do n't give us some money , " he writes to his brother Stanislaus , " we must starve . " To his mother he writes : " . . . I suppose I must do another fast .

The letters of Marx and Engels ? in a recent selection edited by Fritz J. Raddatz** reveal Karl Marx , ignoring the advice of Polonius , perpetually a borrower being , and without either Disraeli 's subtlety or Cummings 's wit . " Dear Engels ! . . . I am short of money . " " Dear Engels ! You will greatly oblige me by sending the money immediately if possible . " " Dear Engels ! Your postal order was most welcome .

Professor Raddatz remarks in his introduction to these letters that they have been culled from nine volumes , running between four and five hundred pages each , of Marx and Engels 's correspondence . How would you like to wake to find that little set of tomes with a ribbon around it under the tree on Christmas morning ? While on the subject of disappointments , Mark Twain , whom one would have thought a wondrous letter writer , turns out to be rather a dud . Readers of The Selected Letters of Mark Twain are set up for this disappointment , at least in part , through the bad offices of the volume 's editor , Charles Neider , who pumps Twain up well beyond capacity . Howells , Mr. Neider reminds us , called Twain " the Lincoln of our literature . " I would add , " And the Shakespeare of our humor . " The humor does not always come through in these letters . Twain 's roleplaying and philistinism , unfortunately , do . Thus he writes to Howells to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Eliot , whose books he , Twain , simply can not get through . He writes to the English critic Andrew Lang asking him not to judge his work by " the cultivated-class standard . " Twain 's real voice only rings clear in his somewhat uxorious letters to his wife , Livy , and it is at her death that his attempts at self-condolence -- -a hopeless project ? are most moving : " I am tired and old , " he writes to Howells . " I wish I were with Livy. " 0 F THE various kinds of letters , surely the most difficult to write are letters of condolence . I dread writing such letters above all others , for the least falseness of feeling cries out , accusing its author of the most serious hypocrisy . Oddly , someone who was very good at writing letters of condolence or providing comfort at times of crisis was Edmund Wilson . I say oddly , because the tendency is to think of Edmund Wilson as an unfeeling man , a tendency that so many of the letters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson and published by Farrar , Straus and Giroux ) support . The characteristic Wilson letter was a lecturette , in which he reprimanded or scolded a fellow writer . Late in life , I am told , Wilson would return his correspondents ' letters with corrections in grammar and usage marked in the margins . But Wilson had himself suffered loss , and he knew its hurt , and this lent to his letters of condolence and comfort a truth of compassion that is impressive . Thus to William Rose Benet , upon the . death of his wife , Elinor Wylie , he writes : " But it 's better to be cut off at the height of life with the head and heart full than to die as most people die . In Elinor 's case , it leaves the impression undimmed of her almost supernatural brilliance and energy ... . You are fortunate in this , that you had more of it than anyone else . I sometimes envied you when Elinor was alive , and in spite of the grief you must now be in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even now . " Easily the most magnificent writer of letters of condolence , though , is Henry James . At a man or woman 's death James could somehow formulate what had been special about the person who had died , and make of this specialness a source of comfort to his or her wife or husband , a keepsake in prose , as if James 's pen portrait were a locket to be worn as a remembrance for the remainder of one 's days . But James was a great letter writer generally ? and in two languages . How he wrote so many beautiful letters while turning out his novels and stories , criticism and travel writing , not to speak of keeping up his social round , is itself an astonishment . " Excuse me for not propping up this impudent assertion by examples , " he writes to his friend Grace Norton , after taking issue with articles she has written about George Eliot and Balzac ; then he adds parenthetically : " ( I have n't time ? I have written ten notes and letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He writes , in French , to Paul Bourget , apologizing for not answering Bourget 's last letter , and saying that the necessities of his own scribbling life forbid him from attending to such general questions as Bourget 's letter raised . Henry James , " indefatigable alchemist , " as Auden once called him , then proceeds to respond to Bourget 's questions about the higher meanings of art . Igor Stravinsky would have dealt with them differently . " Too busy right now to be able to go through all the fascinating things you mention , " he writes in response to a letter from Lincoln Kirstein . Stravinsky is always too busy , for the perfectly sound reason that he was ruthless about his priorities . His art came first ? also second , third , and fourth . Consequently , Stravinsky , Selected Correspondence , * the first of three volumes promised by its editor , Robert Craft , is not the glittering book one might have anticipated , however useful it will be for scholars and future Stravinsky biographers . The maestro took care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , in this volume , are preponderantly about business : conducting dates , publication of his compositions , dealings with librettists , etc . Even the letters exchanged between Auden and Stravinsky are a bit dull . Only hints of the witty man Igor Stravinsky must have been peep through , as when , in a postscript to a letter to Ernest Ansermet , he instructs Ansermet to " Say merde from me to Geneva and its beautiful Freemasonic institutions , and I will be relieved " ; or when he invites Jean Cocteau , who is planning a visit with him in Switzerland , to stay at the Hotel Byron in Villeneuve : " You will be comfortable there , and for quite . modest rates will find all that you need : rooms , baths , hot and cold water , lukewarm women , boys from 8 to 13. . . *Edited and with commentaries by Robert Craft . Knopf. $27.50. 53 GUSTAVE FLAUBERT 1 T HAS been said that one can either write books or read them but that one can not do both . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles or letters but one can not do both . I once expressed this sentiment to a man who wrote a lengthy and highly intelligent response to an article I had published . I thanked him for his letter , but told him that I was under the pressure of various deadlines and could not address myself to the rather complicated questions his letter had posed . I ended by apologizing . Of course I disappointed him , but his letter , single-spaced and three pages long , would have required a full morning to answer . The sadness is that writers want precisely such responses to their work ; the madness is that they seem unable to find time to respond to the response . When it comes to letters , who does not feel that it is better to receive than to give ? The rub is that one must give back to receive more . Does any one class of people respond more tardily to letters than any other ? I would be inclined to say that editorial workers are very poor in this line , being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable exception : H. L. Mencken , who as editor of the American Mercury and for years afterward used , like the old neighborhood dry cleaners , to give same-day service , answering every letter on the day he received it . Very impressive , that , especially since all of Mencken 's letters had at least one lovely touch . " All the usual hypocrisies , " is the way he signed off many of his letters to old friends . But scientists are as a class the poorest of all letter writers ; and they win this laurel , in my experience , by default ? that is , by generally not answering letters sent to them at all . Letters from the young , unless they are witty . are usually not very pleasant to receive , for they are frequently filled with requests for favors or unanswerable questions . I would not have minded receiving letters from the youthful Alfred Lord Tennyson , who was witty and wise beyond his age . The first volume of The Letters of Alfred Lord Tennyson* contains a letter from Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling the subject " annihilatingly barbarous , " and adding : " ' There is no pleasure like proof ' cries the Mathe- Vol. 1 , 1821-1850 . Edited by Cecil Y. Lang and Edgar F. Shannon , Jr . Harvard , The Belknap Press . $30. 54 HENRY JAMES matician . I reverse it , ' There is no proof like pleasure . ' " But even the great German writer Heinrich von Kleist can be a bit much when young . In An Abyss Deep Enough , * a selection of his letters edited and translated by Philip B. Miller , published by E. P. Dutton , the young Kleist shows the complete selfabsorption of the young . Kleist 's early letters are filled with his own " life plan , " and quite unanswerable sentences such as this " Recall that I consider it my duty to take this step ; no merely accidental or extrinsic circumstances can or will hinder the fulfillment of my duty , or destroy the resolve begot of a higher Reason , or unsettle a happiness that is grounded entirely within myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from people approaching the close of life tend , understandably , to be given over to reminiscence . This can have its limitations , but what happened is almost always a more interesting subject than what is going to happen , the latter being the customary subject of the young . The worry of the old is that their letters will bore those younger than themselves . In my experience , they need not worry . The habit of letter writing is dying out . My guess $16.95 . HARPER'S/NOVEMBER 1982 is that fewer and fewer great letter collections will appear from the pens of contemporary writers . Except for people who live in out-of-the-way places ? Flannery O'Connor in Milledgeville , Georgia , comes to mind ? the telephone has increasingly done in the letter as a mode of communication . The temptation , in AT &T's; mortal words , is " to reach out and touch someone , " and nowadays only transatlantic telephone calls still seem financially daunting . This is in many ways a shame , and one that will doubtless have consequences for future generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less likely to be written . But my sense is that people in general , nonliterary as well as literary , write fewer letters now than they did thirty years ago . LET us now consider those letters one ar-dently wished to write but which prudence prevented one from mailing . Everyone has 3 had it in mind to write letters of this kind , p , and many have gone so far as to write them out , me only to shy away at the postbox . It is scarcely shocking to learn that Harry S. Truman , not a man noted for his delicate restraint , wrote a great many of these letters , though interesting that even he held back from mailing them . Monte M. Poen has now collected a number of them under the title Strictly Personal and Confidential , The Letters Harry Truman Never Mailed. * One can sense the delightful feeling of release that the mere writing of these letters must have given Truman . For example , the following letter to a newspaper editor whose paper ran an editorial saying that Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea : " The attached editorial ? it contains a double barrelled bare face lie which I 've marked with a red line . " Then there is this to a scholar who , Truman felt , misunderstood his role in ending World War II : " You write just like the usual egghead . The facts are before you but you 'd like to garble them . " And this , alas like the others never sent , in response to a telegram from Sen. Joseph McCarthy reiterating his claim that there were fifty-seven communists working within the State Department : My dear Senator : I read your telegram of February eleventh from Reno , Nevada with a great deal of interest and this is the first time in my experience , and I was ten years in the Senate , that I ever heard of a Senator trying to discredit his own officials . Your telegram is not only not true and an insolent approach to a situation that should have been worked out between man and man but it shows conclusively that you are not even ft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . I am very sure that the people of Wisconsin are extremely sorry that they are represented by a person who has as little sense of responsibility as you have . There is something about writing a scorching letter to someone that seems even more satisfying than standing toe to toe and telling him off . A letter , unlike a face-to-face encounter , does not allow for any interruption . Moreover , composed in tranquillity , it can be finely formulated , all possibility of flaw or fluster removed . Max Beerbohm provides a sterling example of such a letter in his essay " How Shall I Word It ? " , a send-up of books offering models for letters for all occasions ; here Max is writing to a Member of Parliament Unseated at the Last General Election : Dear Mr. Pobsby-Burford , Though I am myself an ardent Tory , I can not but rejoice in the crushing defeat you have just suffered in West Odgetown . There are moments when political conviction is overborne by personal sentiment ; and this is one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more striking by reason of the splendid manner in which the northern and eastern divisions of Odgetown have been wrested from the Liberal Party . The great bulk Little , Brown . $10.95. of the newspaper-reading public will be puzzled by your extinction in the midst of our party 's triumph . But , then the great mass of the newspaper-reading public has not met you . I have . You will probably not remember me . You are the sort of man who would not remember anybody who might not he of some definite use to him . Such , at least , was one of the impressions you made on me when I met you last summer at a dinner given by our friends the Pelhams . Among the other things in you that struck me were the blatant pomposity of your manner , your appalling flow of cheap platitudes , and your hoggish lack of ideas . , ? The one person in whose behalf I regret your withdrawal into private life is your wife , whom I had the pleasure of taking in to the aforesaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman whose spirit was well-nigh broken by her conjunction with you . Such remnants of cheerfulness as were in her I attributed to the Parliamentary duties which kept you out of her sight for so very many hours daily . I do not like to think of the fate to which the free and independent electors of West Odgetown have just condemned her . Only , remember this : chattel of yours though she is , and timid and humble , she despises you in her heart . I am , dear Mr. Pobsby-Burford , Yours very truly , Harold Thistlake People write angry letters to writers fairly frequently . The worst I ever received began , " May God castrate you , " which seemed to me rather an attentiongetting opening . Mencken used to receive so many angry letters that he had a response printed on postcards , which read : " Dear Sir or Madam , You may or may not be right . " I myself do not write out angry letters , ' but I do sometimes find myself composing them in my mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeasure . One such letter , it strikes me now , ought to go to that political scientist who has been reading other people 's mail . " Dear Professor B. , " it might begin , " You do not know me . I adore you . I must have you . Someday I shall , but not , dear man , until you can keep your elegant nose out of other people 's letters . You can look forward to further letters from me ; in these letters , my love , I shall describe , in detail as vivid as I can make it , the pleasures I have in store for you . These descriptions will have to do until you have eliminated this sad habit of yours , for I could never bring myself to bed with a man who engages in so degrading a practice .
