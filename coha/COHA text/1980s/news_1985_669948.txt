VALLETTA , Malta  --  This handsome little island is overrun with Moslems from Libya and communists from Russia , China and North Korea . The Grand Harbor  --  and grand it truly is  --  is filled with Russian ships . The new dockyard cranes were installed by the People ' s Republic of China . The police were trained by the North Koreans . Western diplomats worry that Malta , with its strategic location in the middle of the Mediterranean  --  it is south of Sicily , north of Libya  --  could become a dangerous Marxist state , harboring Libyan terrorists or even providing a safe harbor for the Russian navy . But it is an unlikely Marxist haven . Ruled for centuries by mighty world powers , it now is on its own , and all the old rules are out the window . For starters , the local Gallup poll suggests that it is the most Roman Catholic nation on earth . Of the island ' s 320 , 000 population , 98% are Catholic , and they go to church on Sunday . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of Europe ' s grandest palaces ; it was once the headquarters for the grand masters of the Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem . Each year , the grand master paid tribute  --  one falcon  --  to the Holy Roman Emperor ' s viceroy in Sicily . ( Right , the Maltese falcon . ) The Maltese are used to foreigners . In 1565 , 700 Knights of St. John and about 7 , 000 ordinary soldiers held off a great Turkish army of 30 , 000 men sent to subdue them by no less than Suleiman the Magnificent . The island held out for 31 days in one of history ' s immortal sieges . The Turks were forced to beat a hasty retreat when a relief force hove into view from Sicily . The tiny island survived a second siege in World War II . Italian and German war planes rained bombs on it for four years . The Maltese endured 3 , 340 air-raid alerts , huddling in bomb shelters for a total of 2 , 357 hours and six minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Britain in 1964 , but the last British soldier didn ' t leave until 1979 . ) But " look what ' s happening to us now , " says Vincent Tabone , president of the executive council of the Nationalist Party , the opposition party in Malta . " We survived centuries of colonial rule . We held on to our culture and our language . We remained one of the oldest civilizations in Europe . Now , finally , we are on our own . And we have an increasingly authoritarian regime . It is a tragedy . " Tourists still flock to Malta to take pictures of the ancient fortifications and soak up the sun . But even the tourists are getting the idea that everything isn ' t strictly on the level here . There are aberrations . Curious , indeed , is something called the Foreign Interference Act . The law makes it illegal , technically at least , for a foreign reporter to interview a local politician without the foreign minister ' s permission . " It is illegal for me to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lounge chair in the lobby of the Phoenicia Hotel , still filled with British tourists with stiff upper lips and memories of the days when they ruled here . There are other curious laws and edicts . The Maltese can ' t buy Japanese products because the Japanese don ' t buy Maltese products . The aim is to punish Japan , though the Japanese economy seems to be surviving . Italy isn ' t popular , either , so it is almost impossible for Maltese to withdraw money from the Bank of Malta to travel to Italy . Also unpopular with the island ' s socialist Labor Party government is the Roman Catholic Church . Not long ago , party hooligans broke into a church building and vandalized the chapel . The government has been attempting , so far without success , to control the Catholic schools , where some 40% of the island ' s children go . The Vatican is attempting to reach an agreement with the government . " We are literally fighting for Malta ' s soul , " says a young Catholic priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island is owned by and used almost exclusively by Libyans . Arabic is now a required language course in all Maltese schools . There is a new mosque built by the Libyans . Recently , Libyan warships have been regularly putting into the Grand Harbor . Libyans don ' t need passports to hop across to Malta ( just an identification card ) . American officials suspect Malta is being used as a jumping off place for Libyan terrorists . They suggest that the Libyans can come here and buy Maltese passports for as little as $300 . They worry that guns used by terrorists may be shipped through here . They even suspect that the uniforms worn by Libyan strongman Muammar Qadhafi are made by Maltese tailors ( who honed their naval tailoring skills on generations of British naval officers ) . Dealing with the government can take on the aura of a James Bond adventure written by Woody Allen . One night , a visiting reporter is told to be at the Labor Party headquarters , located deep within one of the fortress towers built by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interview Alfred Sant , president of the party . The ground floor of the party headquarters is a disco . " We rent it out , " says Mr. Sant , a saturnine management expert educated at Harvard , " but nobody seems to come . " The disco , in fact , is empty . Mr. Sant escorts the visitor through a maze of ancient tunnels , water dripping down their walls . The music from the disco echoes through the ancient fortress . Mr. Sant sits down at a small desk . The visitor sits down across from him . " Would you like to see the prime minister ? " he asks . Mr. Sant and the visitor set off again , finally arriving in a large , handsomely furnished room . Seated at the desk is Prime Minister Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici . Mr. Mifsud Bonnici says most journalists who come to Malta write " naughty " things . He wants to explain what ' s really happening in Malta . Technically this interview may be illegal , for there is no indication the foreign minister has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ' t stop Mr. Mifsud Bonnici , who after all is new to the job . When Malta ' s longtime leader Dom Mintoff stepped down last December , he handpicked his successor . Because Mr. Mifsud Bonnici has never stood for election  --  to any office  --  his Maltese critics call him " Zero . " The man called Zero gives a long , and occasionally impassioned defense of Malta ' s quirky ways . Malta is a little country trying to get along in a big , sometimes cruel world , he suggests . If other countries can trade with Libya , he says , " why can ' t we ? " He denies that Malta is being used as a terrorist center by the Libyans or that Maltese passports are for sale to Libyans . He defends Malta ' s agreement to build eight 8 , 500-ton ships to haul timber for the Soviet Union . Maltese shipyards have never built such big ships . " We had no choice , " the prime minister says . " We literally begged the United States to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are neutrals . We want to do business with everybody . " ( American diplomats say the Maltese have been unable to convince American businessmen that the climate here is congenial for investment . The diplomats add that Maltese leaders can ' t understand that the U.S. government is unable to force businesses to come to Malta . ) It is late in the evening when the interview winds down . Drinks are brought in . The disco music is still playing , far away . Now , the prime minister has a question . " What ' s going to happen to the dollar ? " he asks . He wants to know because most of socialist Malta ' s reserves are in capitalist American dollars . He is disappointed that his visitor is unable to make a prediction .
