S T OR Y SHIP IN A BOTTLE By Annie Dillard On the bay side of Cape Cod , my husband and I own half of a summer cottage and a seventeen-foot Thistle . A Thistle is an old class boat , a racing sloop ; it is open , so you can pile in families for picnics . A year ago July we were embarked upon such a picnic when I found the extraordinary ship in the bottle . We had sailed into fog . The pale bluffs of Wellfleet 's Great Island  --  our destination  --  seemed lower as we approached them . Then we saw the bluffs blur in fog and vanish . When the fog covered our boat , the wind died back and the children began to gripe . " Look ? , " my husband started to say to distract them , but there was nothing to see . Beyond the boat the air in every direction glowed . We could see each other in sharp focus  --  this friend scrambling for a jacket , that friend with a white strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle of waves , dark and crisp around our hull . We heard the boat move through the water . We sailed in a moat of clarity , a floating island like a flat galaxy of Annie Di/lard 's most recent book is The Writing Life , a memoir about writing , to be published this month by Harper &; Raw . matter in a void . When a corked bottle floated by , I reached over the side and let it slide into my palm . It seemed something was in it , something hanging in shreds like torn cloth . It was a ship in a bottle ; we all could see when I brought it aboard . The children , predictably , were not interested . The bottle was sixteen inches long , blown of glass green at its base . It could have held thirty-six ounces of rum , say , or molasses . Its cork was tight . Someone had cunningly fashioned a ship inside it a three-master , classic ship-rigged , beamy and round-hulled , and heavy-decked . The ship 's intricate ratlines looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so brilliantly miniaturized the rest of her hull , deck , and rigging , and each glowing canvas sail , that no one could guess its origin ; you could see the ship only in its whole perfection and imagine a real ship shrunk . Every detail of her rail was carved walnut , it looked like , and her masts were spruces the size of matchsticks . Even the weave of the billowing canvas sails was in scale , so those furled on the yards did not bulge ; even the grain of wood on the decks was in scale , as if lumbered from bonsai trees . On the transom , brass letters spelled FRAM . This perfect ship floated , as it were , in a crude blob of plaster painted blue . trust you have seen ships in bottles . I mention this one and its provenance only because it proved itself unusual six months later , long after I had forgotten about it . Our summer cottage has no insulation ; we close it every fall and flee . We draw the curtains and drain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that empties into Wellfleet Bay . The mean tide range is ten feet ; twice a day our moored Thistle careens itself on a mud flat , and twice a day it floats in the basin of water the tide brings . We have often heard that ice piles up on the tide line in winter  --  we have seen snapshots of muddy , spongy ice lining the beach below our cottage  --  but neither of us had ever seen it until last winter . Last winter , my travels took me The tide was out , but the yard smelled like ice , not mud flat . I entered the cottage and stumbled into the porch furniture heaped inside . Because the house was no warmer than the yard , it seemed colder . The familiar paintings on the walls , the red end tables , the frozen couch , the junky lamps  --  all of these things looked haunted and dear , like beloved objects people put in graves with corpses , to accompany them . I opened the front curtains . My eyes fell on the ship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My husband had carved for the bottle a wooden stand . We had bored guests all that August with the bottle 's small story , what we knew of it : We found it floating in the bay , in a fog . Now , standing at the windowsill , l saw something I will not forget or ever explain . The bottle 's blue water had frozen to white ice . On the ice were many men and dogs ; they lived and moved . 1 could make them out in the bottle 's dim blue light . The yellowish Samoyeds fought on their tethers ; men dressed in fur parkas stroked the dogs and faced each other , gesturing , with lively expressions and open mouths as if talking on an ordinary occasion . Wooden cartons  --  on the ship 's intricately small scale  --  lay strewn about the ice , as did sledges , a potbellied iron stove , and debris too small to recognize . The ship listed on the ice , undamaged . All her rigging was bare ; no canvas was in sight . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men alone interested me . I smiled at them and hazarded a wave . They stood in twilight , unseeing . I resisted , barely , the impulse to knock on their bottle  --  only because I remembered chastening public aquarium signs to the effect that it drives the animals and fish mad if you knock on their glass , which is so precisely what 1 want to do that it seems almost worth it . Down on the white ice in the bottle , one man beat his gray mit tens together . He was talking , apparently , with two bareheaded men , both brown-haired , with iced-up beards . I could see their breaths . I could see my own breath , too ; it was an effort to keep it from fogging on the bottle . The men , ship , and spars cast no shadows ; it was too dark . Two men  --  glistening fur parkas , dark leggings , high fur boots  --  stood at one edge of the ice and simultaneously tore off running to the other edge . When they reached it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see the startling cuts of white that their teeth made in their opened beards . A cloud of white vapor appeared over each tiny face . The two men stood and made their way up the gangplank and into the ship ; one of them opened a hatch on deck and walked into it . The other man followed , and so did everyone else ; the men were clearing the ice . They climbed the gangplank , ducked into the ship , and vanished ; I watched the last fur boot step over the hatchway , and watched the hatch close . The ship did not twitch . The ice held it fast . Now it was dark , inside and out . The chunks of shore ice on our familiar Cape Cod beach held the last light like clouds . In the cottage , behind me I could see only a black heap I knew was porch furniture . My hands were cold . I looked from the window again and saw Jupiter north of Orion 's bare shoulder . Inside the dark bottle , over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fabric of dark colors hung and moved . I could see stars through its spread . The lights waved and billowed across the sky ; their low edge curved like a hem . A little snow was blowing across the wooden ship ; it blew across the wood cartons and iron stove on the ice . The dogs lay fanned out at the end of their traces , each curled , each facing the wind , each with its nose under its rail . A stovepipe on the ship 's deck let out a thread of white smoke , and the wind took it . Last week in mid-May  --  when room curtains . On the windowsill the ship in the bottle looked just as it had when we first found it , just as it had last August : a wooden ship bearing many bright square sails . Its round hull rested on a blob of plaster painted blue . We settled into our summer routines . Last night I was reading on the couch beside the windowsill , as is my habit , My husband was out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart , the story of a Labrador canoe expedition ) I enjoyed so much that when it ended in my hands and I looked back through it and studied the maps and read the beginning again , I put it down in sorrow , and , rather than rise and find another book so betrayingly soon , I picked up the ship in a bottle . As I had so often during this past week , I turned the bottle over in my hands . I searched the ship 's wooden deck for a sign of the hatch that led belowdecks . Again I sought in the rigging for men , and tried at the wheel , and the rail , and the peak . I searched the blue plaster sea . I looked under the sea , even  --  between the plaster and the glass , as if for bodies . But it was on the surface of the sea that I saw something new , a cylinder the size of a splinter . It was too regular for a splinter , however ; both ends were flat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pliers , finally , that I uncorked the bottle . The cylinder slid into my palm . It was a log of cork ; age or water had blackened it . A seam circumscribed it . With care I pulled both ends ; the cork parted at the seam and revealed a wooden cylinder within . This inner cylinder was the size of a chocolate jimmie , the sort children sprinkle on ice cream . In the scale of the ship in the bottle , the cork log was the size of a hand telescope and the inner cylinder the size of a cigar case . I saw with something akin to disgust that this small cylinder was itself a case ; a seam disclosed its wooden cap , I have no patience with small things and , frankly , no interest in them . Close views of forest moss or leaves bore me to exasperation , sewing frightens me , tiny dolls appall me I like volleyball , I like to slam the ball . Still , having come this far , I had ing this wretched text under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . l keep my only microscope at the Cape Cod cottage ; in recent years I have looked through it only at sand . I laid the papers side by side on a glass slide and covered them with another glass slide . My husband and daughter stood by my study desk interested and eager to the point of hopping , both of them , I noted that their hopping shook the floor . When my neck wearied of this sore work , however , and my husband took it over , I hopped too ; the words came out so slowly . The words did not explain in any way what the ship called the Fram was doing in the bottle , or in the ice . In fact , there is no clear inference  --  given the peculiar nature of this bottle that the cork case came from the ship . The cork case and its broken text could have floated into the vicinity of the Frain on the surface of the great intermingled sea all ships share . ( Except , of course , that the bottle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowsill . Every theory has problems . ) Under the microscope I saw a clear , smooth script brown ink on yel-lowed paper . I expected a broken grain to the magnified handwriting , because magnified ordinary writing or print shatters under magnification and reveals flaws . But in this case magnification merely restored the document 's original scale . I could make out eleven or twelve lines of script at the same time , before 1 had to nudge the slide . 12th . There was so much visibility last week on the 8th lit began that we bottled some in flasks and stored the flasks , tightly stoppered , in one of the forward holds . Today , our first day of no visibility , a day of blinding fog , we made our experiment . The captain signaled me , and I signaled the mate : He walked forward into the bows , uncorked the first flask , held it in an outstretched arm , and released its contents into the air . At once blue sky streaked from the flask and ripped across the fog . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In it , I could see a petrel dashing along the top of the water , and I could see calm seas to the horizon . I sat on the rail and looked down . Through the banner of clarity I could see several inches into the water , which was green and filled with jellyfish . The banner-shaped patch of visibility was ten feet long and as narrow as the flask 's neck . As our ship drew along slowly ( for there is rarely great wind in a fog ) , all aboard realized that we should soon lose the visibility over our stern . The captain gave an order , and a man , Larsen , on the afterdeck reached out with a belaying pin and snagged it . He moved it with care , rolling the pin until the center of the clear patch wrapped around it . He lowered it from the air , gingerly pinched it at a corner , and , trailing it from his fingers like a China-man 's kite , carried it to the captain . We were hard-pressed to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rightly , that touching it would smear the visibility with finger smudges , or , worse , tear it . Accordingly , the captain held it by the same corner Larsen had used , and waved the men away . Slowly he brought a shred of it before his eyes . He looked through it thoughtfully , out to sea . He passed the flowing thing , as if it were an angel , to the sailmaker , who sat and brought his curved needles to bear on its corners . He fashioned delicate grommets there , and whipped their edges with cod line . Then the mare lashed the visibility to the lee bow between forestay and shroud . There it cut a slash of clear and colored vision in the fog . It revealed the sea and the sky , far and near in their proper colors . The pale fog lay all around the slash like a limed wall . We sent a man forward for another flask . The ship possessed altogether two dozen flasks of visibility . The captain will decide how many we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope to sight Spitsbergen after dawn . The pages ended here , at one paper 's lower edge . My tale ends here , too , as my story converges on the present and finds me at my desk . I have stored the small papers in the slide case between two glass slides lashed together , so the papers do not blow away . This cottage is old and loosely made . Even here at my desk I smell mud at low tide ; the west wind carries it . ?
