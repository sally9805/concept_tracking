The mayor rides a softer image into a strong lead <P> <P> Chicago 's modern political history reads like a florid novel , chockablock with shameless rascals and small-time chiselers , ethnic vendettas , loose talk , brazen vote fraud and suspicious sums of cash . The protagonist of Volume I , of course , was Mayor Richard J. Daley , the city 's flinty czar for 21 years until his death in 1976 . The plot of the sequel , still unfolding , is no less vivid . <P> In next week 's Democratic mayoral primary , Incumbent Jane Byrne , for years a Daley protegee , is opposed in her campaign for a second term by her patron 's eldest son , State 's Attorney Richard M. Daley , and by black U.S. Representative Harold Washington , a spunky orator . The winner of the primary will be a shoo-in for the general election seven weeks later ; Chicago , its 50-member city council entirely Democratic , last elected a Republican mayor in 1927 . <P> Mayor Byrne , 48 , is the heavy favorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in real jeopardy . But a Gallup poll released late last month found Byrne to be the first choice of 45% of registered voters , with 23% preferring Washington and 22% for Daley . The campaign expenditures are even more lopsided : Byrne has raised $9.7 million since her surprising , underfinanced election in 1979 , while Daley has got contributions and loans of $1.8 million , and Washington just $377,000 . Taken together , the campaign will probably be the most expensive mayoral election in U.S. history . <P> Much of Byrne 's huge budget has gone into TV advertising . Her slick commercials have run as often as 15 times daily since November , the most effective contending that the mayor singlehanded righted Chicago 's wild fiscal course . ( The commercials pass over the resulting $407 million in tax increases over the past four years . ) Other ads project a new , less shrill image , helped by Byrne 's gradual superficial transformation : her hair style and clothing have become more muted , and she has remained uncharacteristically placid in the face of bitter campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month in jail in 1972 for failing to pay $508.05 in income taxes , has only an outsider 's chance . Yet in a city 40% black , he might win if he picks up a solid majority of the 650,000 registered black voters and a liberal tenth of the whites . His likely effect , however , will be to hurt Daley 's chances of exploiting black antagonism to Byrne . As Cook County 's chief prosecutor since 1980 , when he beat a Byrne-backed candidate , Daley , 40 , has impressed the legal community as being industrious and levelheaded . He has cast doubt on Byrne 's putative fiscal remedies , pointing out that she vastly overstates her inherited budget deficit and in effect has been borrowing from municipal pension funds to help balance the books . He is , however , an awkward campaigner , and political analysts wonder how much Daley 's dynastic surname will help : the electorate remains ambivalent about the corrupt but efficiently run era of Daley the elder . Still , the young Daley carries his father 's battered old briefcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the part .
