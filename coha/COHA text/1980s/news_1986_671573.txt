With Mr. Marcos gone , his optimism has soared . He will consider raising his tax payments , he said , to 50 percent of his fair share. // The overnight ascension of Corazon C. Aquino as the country ' s leader has left many Filipinos almost giddily hopeful that she will be able to improve economic , political and social troubles that were neglected and , in good measure , deepened by the Marcos regime . <> <> Many Hedge Their Bets // But like the tax-evading businessman , many are also hedging their bets , doubtful that anyone , no matter how well intentioned , can erase the problems quickly. // The military that propped up Mr. Marcos is generally acknowledged to be inefficient , ill-equipped and frequently undisciplined and brutal . It has been unable to contain a Communist insurgency that has spread to most of the country ' s 73 provinces , costing thousands of lives each year. // Most Filipinos live in poverty - per capita income is $822 - and their condition is made worse by a high population-growth rate. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe recession since 1983 , to the point that domestic and foreign companies say they do not wish to invest any more money here . <> <> Tough Country to Govern // Not that the picture is entirely gloomy . The Philippines is agriculturally fertile , and many economists believe it could be industrially sound , too , if properly managed . It has an educated , eager-to-work people who have long proved their resiliency through hard times. // As this month ' s political turmoil demonstrated , they also have a strong taste for democracy. // Nevertheless , the Philippines - an archipelago of 7 , 100 islands , 52 million people and 87 native languages - is a difficult country for anyone to govern . It is culturally splintered , and regionally divided , with a tradition of predatory politics and strong-arm tactics. // And the problems that loom before Mrs. Aquino are so intertwined that she must deal with all of them if she hopes to solve any. // One that presents itself right away is the need to shape up the faction-ridden armed forces , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Mr. Marcos ' s Chief of Staff , Gen. Fabian C. Ver , the 200 , 000-member military was top-heavy with officers whose main credentials were their allegiance to the President . In many instances , they were more powerful than their superiors . <> <> Change Is Resisted // Younger officers , complaining that cronyism had kept them from winning promotions , pressed in vain for change. // Experts agree that morale in the armed forces under General Ver sank to dangerous levels . Professionalism declined , as did discipline . Army units have terrorized villages and killed anti-Marcos political opponents . Also , increasingly , they have been sent into the field without adequate equipment because of high-level mismanagement. // As might be expected , none of this has helped the battle against the Communist New People ' s Army , which has gained considerable strength in the countryside. // How serious an immediate threat the rebels present to the entire country is sharply debated , here and in the United States , but there is little argument that the Communists seize upon anti-Government resentment in villages that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops. // In those regions , anti-Marcos politicians have said , people view the guerrillas as a reasonable alternative to a regime that they regarded as corrupt and uncaring . Mrs. Aquino ' s newly appointed Chief of Staff , Gen. Fidel V. Ramos , argued on Wednesday that simply by ridding themselves of Mr. Marcos , Filipinos had bolstered confidence in government and deprived the insurgents of " a very significant portion of their mass base . " <> <> U.S. Bases at Issue // Nevertheless , the New People ' s Army is not likely to go away. // It is so pervasive that last year a band of guerrillas penetrated a jungle area surrounding the United States ' huge naval station at Subic Bay , 50 miles northwest of Manila . A Senate subcommittee delegation called the security breach " nothing short of incredible. " // In the next few years , if she is still in office , Mrs. Aquino will have to negotiate a new agreement governing use of the naval base and the nearby Clark Air Base . Both are strategically critical to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment has grown in recent years , fueled by nationalism , the Communist insurgency and a belief among some Marcos opponents that only American aid kept him in power. // The existing agreement expires in 1991 , and well before then the Philippine President must decide what to do about installations that feed an estimated $330 million into the economy and bring in $900 million in American aid , which Filipinos call " rent. " // Many of its problems could be eased if the Philippines improved its economy , acknowledged by Mr. Marcos himself in his final days to be in " crisis. " // His mere absence helps , businessmen say , asserting that the new Government will probably produce a better team of planners , one less trammeled by the cronyism that characterized the Marcos years . <> <> Economy Down 9. 5 Percent // In the last two years , the economy has shrunk by 9. 5 percent. // Some problems were beyond on the Government ' s control , such as declines in world prices for Philippine sugar and copper , and high interest rates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created many of his own troubles. // Unlike other Asian countries , the Philippines did not target industries for a successful export-oriented economy . Too much money and not enough thought went into grandiose mining and shipping ventures that failed. // Worst of all , his critics say , Mr. Marcos favored friends by putting them in charge of Government-aided monopolies in sugar , coconuts , cocoa and other commodities . Many of the cronies - who are called that even by pro-Marcos Filipinos - proved incompetent ; some whose businesses collapsed sought , and obtained , costly Government bailouts. // Where the money all went is not clear , but bankers and economists estimate that between $10 billion and $30 billion in Philippine capital flowed overseas. // To pay its bills , the country borrowed heavily , to a point where its foreign debt is now $26 billion . It must use one-third of its export earnings to keep up with interest costs . Foreign investment has all but disappeared . <> <> Great Gaps in Wealth // For the average Filipino , these large numbers probably mean less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by great gaps in individual wealth . According to some estimates , 70 percent of the population lives in poverty , while the affluent often live ostentatiously well. // The per capita income of $822 is down 15 percent from 1982 . The Philippine peso , as measured against the dollar , is worth one-fourth what it was eight years ago . Unemployment stands at 15 percent , and so-called underemployment at 40 percent. // All this has produced growing unrest , with twice the number of labor strikes last year as in 1983. // The Philippines ' main salvation now is the International Monetary Fund , which is offering its own loans and help in restructuring the foreign debt . The fund has insisted on a strict regimen of austerity , and that has made economic growth ever more elusive. // What many businessmen hope is that foreign banks and companies , and perhaps the United States Government as well , will come forth with capital and aid now that the Marcos era is over. // " There are too many uncertainties , and they all boil down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a few days before Mr. Marcos fled . He and others are betting that that credibility may be in sight. //
