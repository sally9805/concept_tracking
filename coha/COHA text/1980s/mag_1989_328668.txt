To bash or not to bash : that is the question . Whether ' t is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous trade practices . Or to take arms against protectionist barriers . To punish , to avenge . Perchance to trigger a trade war . Ay , there 's the rub that must give us pause . <P> The dilemma is as thorny as was Hamlet 's : Should the U.S. adopt a tougher , more adversarial trade posture toward Japan ? From Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill , many Americans long to retaliate against Japan for what they regard , with some justification , as one-sided trading practices . Yet the urge to lash out is tempered by a self-protective need to maintain harmonious economic and political relations with America 's most vital Asian ally . The quandary has ; left the Bush Administration walking a fine line between heated cries to battle by congressional trade hawks and equally urgent calls for restraint by dedicated free traders . Last week President Bush took a congressionally mandated swipe at Japan , but delivered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel compelled to counterpunch . <P> Washington unsheathed the newest weapon in its trade arsenal : a law requiring the U.S. Trade Representative to single out countries that systematically restrict American access to their markets . Encouraged by frustrated U.S. trade groups and corporations , legislators had Japan in mind when they passed the provision  --  dubbed Super 301  --  as part of last year 's trade bill . After listening to the conflicting advice of his evenly divided Cabinet , Bush responded to the prevailing protectionist mood in Congress and gave Trade Representative Carla Hills the go-ahead to put Japan on the Super 301 hit list , along with Brazil and India . <P> Specifically , Japan was charged with restricting the import of U.S.-made supercomputers , satellites and lumber products . Under Super 301 , Washington will negotiate with the targeted countries for removal of the barriers ; if no progress is made , the law allows for retaliatory tariffs against some of the offenders ' imports . <P> While moderate legislators saw Bush 's limited response as a well-measured step , some members of Congress felt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . They contended that Japanese barriers extended well beyond the three areas cited , to items ranging from cellular phones and medical equipment to fish products and aluminum . " The Administration 's feeble use of the Super 301 provision comes in the face of our continuing trade deficit , " said Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt , whose tough trade proposals gave rise to the Super 301 legislation . " ( ( Bush ) ) has signaled to the world that he will take ( ( Japan 's ) ) trade abuse lying down . " <P> Critics of Super 301 fretted that the tactics might backfire , provoking retaliatory measures from a Japan that is tired of being blamed for U.S. economic ills . The rumblings from Japan were ominous . Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno called in newly appointed U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost to protest Japan 's inclusion on the list . " As a result of many market-opening measures , the Japanese market has now become wide open , " he insisted .
