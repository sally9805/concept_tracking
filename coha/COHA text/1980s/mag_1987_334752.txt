The spy case that appeared at first to be an isolated instance of two lonely Marines being seduced into espionage at the U.S. embassy in Moscow took a broader and more ominous turn last week . A third Marine was charged with illegal fraternization with Soviet women , and two other pairs of former embassy guards are suspected of having been compromised by female contacts . As the scandal spread , both the Marine and State Department supervisors of the 28-man guard contingent came under increasing criticism for their failure to monitor the behavior of the Marines more closely . Rather than clean-cut Americans being entrapped by their innocence , it seems , all too many of the guards were hard-drinking , brawling women-chasers whose wild partying was condoned . <P> " The Marines have been difficult all along , " Arthur Hartman , who retired only last month as Ambassador to Moscow , told TIME last week . " They are trained for a different kind of duty , and in a place like Moscow , they 're young people who do n't have the maturity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shipped home , Hartman disclosed , after a British nanny accused two of them of raping her last December in the Marine quarters in the embassy building . The Marine Corps charged the two with allowing the woman into the embassy and with having sex with a foreign national , but would not reveal their punishment . The others failed to report the incident , and some were also accused of illegal currency exchanges . On another occasion , said Hartman , Marines had " decked " a worker from another embassy during a presumably friendly game of broomball , a form of ice hockey . <P> ) The young servicemen were known in Moscow for their parties at " Marine House , " the name given the embassy quarters in which they lived . Two men occupied each tiny room , off long hallways on four of the building 's nine floors . On Fridays , a " TGIF " ( Thank God It 's Friday ) affair in the second- floor lounge of Marine House would include West European and American nannies who cared for the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who worked at the embassy until the Kremlin ordered all its citizens out of clerical and custodial jobs in the building last October . <P> The young set drank and danced to loud rock music until 1 a.m . " There was always a lot of booze , " recalls a former American nanny . " People got more and more rowdy as the night progressed . You 'd see couples sprawled all over the couches , and others would head off into the Marines ' rooms . " She claimed that even a Marine noncom leader joined in the " Animal House " carousing . " When you see your boss getting dead drunk and going around pinching women , it does n't make for a very strict atmosphere . " <P> Stories about the Marines ' behavior are rife among former Soviet embassy employees , although these workers , who often report to the KGB , have reasons to exaggerate . " They were wild , " a Soviet woman translator said of the Marines . " They chased all the skirts , Russian or otherwise . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet secretary who had booked dinners for embassy personnel said that many Moscow restaurants would not accept the Marines " because they got drunk and got into fights with other customers .
