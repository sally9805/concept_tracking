When you ' re only betting $2 on the horses , a loss at the track should not seem like a big deal . That , after all , only amounts to two corndogs across the street , or half a ribeye sandwich . But Monday at the Illinois State Fair , the $2 bettors were as serious as the big boys at Arlington , and the slap of programs hitting the floor was just as forceful when a favorite did not perform . It was the first day of parimutuel betting on harness racing , and with sunny skies and a cool breeze , it was " a perfect day for racing-a No. 1 day , " or so said Ralph Blaudow , 77 , of Seymour . Blaudow , with his wife , Bessie , and two friends , drove over early Monday morning just to plunk down some pocket change on the horses . " We just do it for the fun . You spend a little money , make a little money , and you meet nice people , " said Blaudow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go up to Chicago to the track once a week , but the people we used to go with-they ' re all gone . " The Blaudows recruited Duane Massie and Betty Cravens , their favorite fellow beer drinkers and pizza eaters , who took a day off from work at the Farmers Home Administration in Champaign , to make the trip . Upwards of 5 , 000 people filled the grandstand at the fair to watch the horses come down what ' s billed as " the world ' s fastest track , " which will be open through Friday . And with an early-morning drizzle that burned off before the first race , the track was fast indeed . Massie and Cravens were not quite as experienced at the track as the Blaudows , particularly Bessie , a petite woman with curly gray hair and big glasses . More often than not , she jumped to the edge of her seat , clutching her program and waving her horse on in , anything to make it cross the finish line first . She was serious : Her bets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever went was to Du Quoin ( Illinois ' other state fair ) , and Bessie told me how to bet . She said , Bet on the horses that had made money , ' and I made so much money . That was her theory and it worked there , but it ' s not working too good now , " said Cravens , who after nine races had won all of $2. 80 . Bessie , who spends $10 every week in the lottery and does not really qualify as a gambler , said the information to win was available to anyone who could read . " You just read up on the program : how much money they ' ve won , how many times the horse ' s been out , what the track is . It ' s all in this book , " Bessie said , tapping the $2 harness racing program . " This is how I like to do it , " interrupted Ralph , putting his hands on the person ' s shoulders in front of him and turning her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just watch the horses , see how they look , then you go up and pick them . " Two-thirds through the afternoon , Ralph claimed to have made money , though he would not say how much . " You ' d put it in the paper and then I ' d have to pay taxes on it , " he said . " On $2 ? " Betty asked , laughing . No one in the bunch was hurting as much as Massie , who had lost $20 , and who , by the way , was also buying beer for the group . And Bessie conceded she might have lost a little . By the 10th of 15 races , Massie was looking for guidance from Otis Miller , the fellow in the next row who will close Otis ' Barbershop in Bulpitt this week to go to the races . Miller was with Duane Steele , who won a couple bucks on one race because he picked horses with the numbers 10 and 1 . That selection was not from the program , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . " I usually make a couple of bucks , " said Miller , who , like the crowd behind him , was betting a couple of dollars , but according to his philosophy one should go to the track only every other day . " You make a couple bucks today , you lose it tomorow , and you make a couple bucks the next day . " Miller planned to bet $65 , which he grabbed from his dresser and stuffed in his pockets at home that morning . " Some of these guys , " he said , " go up there and bet $200 or $300 on a race . These people are from all over .
