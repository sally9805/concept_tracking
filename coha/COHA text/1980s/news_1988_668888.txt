The secret is not to think before you pull the rifle trigger . " It ' s just a reaction , " said Rich Gross , one of the U.S. biathletes here for the Winter Olympics . " You see a shooter who ' s just skied to the range and he looks as steady as a rock . " But if you could look through his rifle sights , you ' d see that he ' s not steady at all . " We ' re all over those targets . Our hearts are pumping anywhere from 165 to 200 beats a minute from the skiing and there ' s no way you can hold those sights steady . They just bounce along with your heart . " You don ' t think ' Pull ' at all . If you do , it ' s too late . You simply react . You passively look at the target and there it is . Bang . " There was a period when U.S. biathletes tried to calm their frenzied breathing before the crucial shooting phases in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 10 targets in the 10-kilometer race and 20 in the 20-kilometer , and no more than two or three misses can be tolerated . " But we learned from the East Germans , " Gross said . " They are masters at steaming into the range and setting up to shoot at extremely agitated heart rates . " Lyle Nelson , a veteran of four Olympics , said the best shooting comes before the body relaxes . " At high rates , your heart has almost a flutter beat , " Nelson said . " The sights don ' t jump much at all . But if you let your heart rate slow too much , it ' s like looking at your own electrocardiogram . Bump , bump , bump . So you try to get the shots off as fast as you can . " Each trip to the range in a race requires five shots . In the 10k , biathletes fire five shots at tiny bull ' s-eyes from a prone position and five at larger targets from a standing one . " The larger targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nelson said . But then you have other problems . You get muscle tremors and twitches . " All the time , you ' re operating at 80 percent oxygen starvation , and your brain and eyes are equally impaired . It becomes a major test of concentration . " Nelson said the esthetics of biathlon require slipping into a semisubconscious state of mind . " You get mesmerized by the surge of motion , the power of going so fast so effortlessly , " Nelson said . " Surging uphill becomes just as exciting as going downhill at 80 miles per hour and turning a corner . It isn ' t just grinding uphill or packing around a course , seeing how much you can hurt . Fatigue is not pain . The game is digging deep into yourself to get through a period when your bones and muscles slow and want to stop . It is working yourself into a state of supreme concentration . " Most people can not concentrate for very long . We work at concentrating two minutes , then getting up to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do is 30 seconds on the range . " We go through our keys : Is the sling right ? Is the rifle butt seated ? Is everything ready ? Then it ' s like a veil comes over your eyes and you stop thinking . You just focus on the target and let go when you think it ' s right . " Josh Thompson , a silver medalist in last year ' s World Championships and America ' s best hope for its first biathlon Olympic medal , said shooting was the toughest part of the sport for him to learn . " I was wretched the first few times I raced , " he said . " I must have missed 50 percent of my targets . In the 1983 World University Games , I even crossfired in the 20k race . I hit ' em all , but they were the wrong targets . I couldn ' t believe it . There were flags running straight from me down the range and I still shot the wrong ones . " Fortunately , shooting takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already excelled . " At least you don ' t have to develop a physiology to become a shooter , " he noted . Thompson later finished sixth in the 10k behind five Soviets , opening eyes around the world . " I was saying , ' Where did I come from ? ' and they were saying , ' Where did he come from ? ' " Thompson recalled . Thompson rapidly improved to the point where Soviet and East German biathletes no longer regard Americans as mainly sources for trading pins . " It ' s a small world , biathlon , " he said . " I think they ' re glad to see us come along . " CAPTION : PHOTO : ( color ) AP Laserphoto .
