The telephone console resting on a gargantuan round table boasts 90 buttons , and the man seated before it seems bent on using all of them at once . His plump fingers , the nails freshly manicured with clear polish , poke impatiently at the instrument . Visitors flow into the office in a steady stream , yet all the while the man continues a separate dialogue with the console . " He would n't be a bureaucrat unless he was in a meeting , " he booms into the speaker in a British-accented baritone that is powerful yet velvety . " I want the man , not the message . " Poke . A button away , he barks in German , " Cease offers . It is 400 million locked up for the duration . " Poke . In French , he issues a command for his son Ian , 31 , in Paris : " Call him at the restaurant . Tell him to get on the Concorde . " Poke . Now , in English , he asks another son Kevin , 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire , " How is the market ? " <P> Despite the world map branded with a giant M , the London headquarters of Robert Maxwell 's communications empire is conservative by U.S. corporate standards . Yet there is nothing modest about the man at the round table , his command central . " Captain Bob " coined by the press  --  is a boulder of a man : easily 250 lbs. , and 6 ft. 2 in. tall .

Yet despite the colossal Mont Blanc gold pen he wields like a fat cigar , the enormously expensive Lord &; Stewart suit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter , the yacht with a crew of 14 , the personal chef , the Rolls-Royces , the thing Maxwell really values most is time . Whether dealing with family , managers or minions , Maxwell is constantly ordering , pushing , scolding and hectoring , much like a nagging parent . <P> Five managers from his newspaper , the Daily Mirror , a working-class tabloid housed in the adjoining Mirror Group building , surround him at the table . Though they are accustomed to the constant interruptions , the lightning shifts in ideas , deals , languages , Maxwell knows they are growing impatient and holds them in check with his translucent amber eyes , which he uses like headlights to paralyze his prey . Punching a button on the console , Maxwell purrs , " You are up , good . It is 5 a.m . Find out how much they want for the National Enquirer . " The citizens of Maxwell 's empire know no time zones . Finally he is off the phone just long enough to address a problem with the Mirror 's presses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I observe the master , " the manager quips in response , noting that Captain Bob 's spirits are high this morning .
