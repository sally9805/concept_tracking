Some portentous voices out of the underworld a quarter-century ago : <P> " Kennedy 's not going to make it to the ( ( 1964 ) ) election  --  he 's going to be hit . " <P>  --  Santo Trafficante , the top Florida mobster , to an FBI informer in August 1962 . <P> " You know what they say in Sicily : if you want to kill a dog , you do n't cut off the tail , you cut off the head . " <P>  --  Carlos Marcello , Mafia boss in New Orleans , to an acquaintance that same month , explaining why President John Kennedy , not Attorney General Robert Kennedy , would be killed . <P> " There is a price on the President 's head . Somebody will kill Kennedy when he comes down South . " <P>  --  Bernard Tregle , a New Orleans restaurant owner allegedly associated with Marcello , within hearing of one of his employees in April 1963 . <P> Out of the mouths of such sinister characters the assassination-conspiracy theorists of the 1980s have fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may forever remain unexplainable : why Lee Harvey Oswald killed John F. Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22 , 1963 , exactly 25 years ago this week . In an anniversary spate of books and TV specials , the trendy theory is that the Mafia arranged the President 's murder and the silencing of Oswald by Dallas strip-joint owner Jack Ruby . This , of course , clashes with the Warren Commission 's conclusion that Oswald acted alone for his own twisted reasons and that Ruby impetuously killed the assassin to spare Jacqueline Kennedy the ordeal of a Dallas trial of her husband 's slayer . <P> As the excerpts from James Reston Jr . ' s forthcoming book show , there are new twists on the lone-assassin conclusion as well . His contention that Oswald may have intended to kill Texas Governor John Connally rather than Kennedy was rather perfunctorily dismissed by the Warren Commission . Although Marina Oswald had testified to this belief , the commission 's lawyers found her generally inconsistent and discounted much of what she said . The commission relied on Texas prosecutor Henry Wade for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheard at Ruby 's Carousel Club by Dallas lawyer Carroll Jarnagin . Wade found Jarnagin sincere in thinking he had heard Oswald offer to kill Connally so that gangsters could open up the state for their rackets , but he told the commission that the lawyer nonetheless had failed a lie-detector test on the subject . <P> Other theories persist : that Oswald , an avowed Marxist who had gone from service as a U.S. Marine to spend more than two years in the Soviet Union , returned as a homicidal tool of the KGB ; that when he tried to go back to the Soviet Union via Cuba in September 1963 , Fidel Castro 's embassy in Mexico City encouraged him to kill Kennedy . The reason : Castro knew that the CIA had plotted with Chicago mobster Sam Giancana and Hollywood boss John Roselli to kill him . <P> Support , of a sort , for the Castro-as-mastermind theory recently came from David W. Belin , a top counsel for the Warren Commission . In his new book , Final Disclosure , Belin says that " it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have developed , Belin writes , when Oswald visited Mexico City .
