Dear Ann Landers : My beautiful , bright 27-year-old appeared at my doorstep one evening last year with her 18-month-old child in her arms . She had lost 30 pounds and was flying high on cocaine . We put her in a hospital , but her " connection " kept bringing drugs to her room . Three weeks into the program , her doctor called me and said , " Come and get your daughter . She is not responding to treatment . " I knew she was dying , so I sat and prayed . I picked up the phone , called a substance-abuse clinic and told them my story . That very day I said to my daughter , " Pack your clothes . I ' m taking you to a place where you are going to get well . " I prayed for 200 miles . Today my daughter is six months clean . From the clinic she went to a halfway house . She now has a good job , lives with two recovering addicts and will have her little girl with her within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is very happy . The message for your readers with loved ones who are addicted is DON ' T GIVE UP ! Remember that addicts are powerless to help themselves . They need help from someone who is clear-headed and will stick by them and insist that they get treatment . Thanks , Ann , for listening to a story with a happy ending . No name , please . Austin , Tex . Dear Austin : Beautiful . I ' m sure your letter will give encouragement to those who are struggling with the agonizing problem you faced a while back . They need the kind of hope you have given them . Bless you for sharing . Dear Ann Landers : I ' ve never seen this problem in your column and I ' m too embarrassed to ask anyone else about this . I hope you can help me . I am a 45-year-old woman , happily married for 25 years ( I thought ) . Last spring , my 16-year-old daughter introduced me to her new boyfriend . He was 22 . After meeting him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love at first sight . " They continued to see one another all summer and fall , and she told me that she was crazy about him . Every time I saw the young fella my heart thumped like mad , but of course I kept my feelings to myself . I prayed that they would become engaged although deep down I knew she was too young for that . Two weeks ago they broke up . I don ' t know what happened and I didn ' t ask . But , Ann , I can ' t seem to get over it . I am heartbroken and there is a big void in my life . My daughter never talks about him and seems to be adjusting very well . But I ' m a wreck . None of this makes any sense . I ' m ashamed of myself . Am I sick ? Can you help ? Please try . Menopausal Mama ( San Diego ) Dear M.M. : Some mothers have a tendency to relive their lives through their daughters . I wouldn ' t call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely healthy . In time you will recover , Mom . Meanwhile , I hope you won ' t pressure your daughter to get back with the fellow . It would be better for all concerned if she dated a young man you didn ' t have a mad crush on . Dear Ann Landers : I hate being pestered by people who intrude on my privacy and try to sell me something over the telephone . Many of these calls originate in other cities . How can I escape these pests ? Torrance , Calif . Dear Torrance : Write to : Telephone Preference Service , Direct Marketing Assn. , 6 E. 43rd St. , New York , N.Y. 10017 .
