How old all of this now seems , and how far away from what has happened to architecture since . The freshness , the daring , the triumphant sense of newness that was the International Style ' s stock in trade is today neither fresh nor daring , and least of all is it new . If anything , the works of architecture that appeared in the exhibition by now seem quaint ; the sense of revolution they represented comes across now not as powerful but more as prim , puritanical , and not a little innocent. // For architecture has gone in different directions altogether since the day , 50 years ago this month , that the International Style exhibition opened . It is not that modernism did not turn out to amount to anything - it amounted to very much indeed , since buildings in some way influenced by the International Style dominated the American downtown for decades . Without the International Style , there would have been no Third Avenue - or at least a very different Third Avenue. // But the stark boxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . We still build in glass , and we still build sleek , crisp forms , but we have almost completely given up the International Style ' s cold , rigorous austerity . And what we have wisely given up on altogether is the International Style ' s firm moral posture - the sense its architects had that they knew what was right for us , the belief that the precise and hard-edged lines of modernism were a positive force liberating us from the harsh stranglehold of history. // This was precisely the stance taken by the museum ' s International Style exhibition . The show , which was organized by Philip Johnson , who began his career as the museum ' s first curator of architecture , was seen by 33 , 000 people at the museum and by thousands more as it traveled around the country . Several times this many people , of course , have read and continue to read the book " The International Style " by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Mr. Johnson which appeared at the same time . Together the exhibition and the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of modern architecture . The exhibition was a sort of debutante cotillion , at which the style was dressed up and given its formal presentation to a waiting world ; the book recorded the happy debut for posterity. // The importance of this event has always been more symbolic than real , 50 years ago as much as today . In February 1932 , the International Style was not really brand new - its great monuments , buildings like the Villa Savoie in Poissy , France , by Le Corbusier ; the Bauhaus in Dessau , Germany , by Walter Gropius ; or the Tugendhat House in Brno , Czechoslavakia , by Mies van der Rohe , had all been complete for at least two years and were fairly well known . And by then the style had already begun to cross the Atlantic , too . The exhibition contained such American buildings as the Starrett Lehigh Building in New York of 1931 , by Russel G. Cory ; Raymond Hood ' s McGraw-Hill Building , also in New York , of 1932 ; and Richard Neutra ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What this famous exhibition and the long-lived book that accompanied it did was to grant a certain legitimacy to a style that was coming , by virtue of forces far more powerful than those controlled by Mr. Hitchcock , Mr. Johnson or anyone else at the Museum of Modern Art , to play a larger and larger role in shaping the cityscape . The Museum of Modern Art ' s stamp of approval made the International Style ' s growth somewhat smoother and easier , but it did not , of course , bring all this modern architecture into being in the first place . Popular writers such as Tom Wolfe have lately made great sport of the myth that the International Style was some sort of foreign plot foisted upon an unwilling America by a group of European intellectuals led by the Museum of Modern Art ; in fact , acceptance of the style had been growing slowly for years , and the museum show merely confirmed that fact. // The real point of the show was to argue what , back then , was a relatively new notion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in architectural history . To make this point all the stronger , the organizers were ruthlessly selective . Only those modern buildings whose clean lines seemed intended to exemplify the esthetic of sleek , light form were welcome . Not only was anything that even hinted at ornament banished , so were modern buildings of what might be called a merely functionalist bent . Plain old factories , in other words , need not apply ; industrial buildings with the right lines , however , were the heroes of the day. // Modernism continued to spread through this country for at least four decades after the exhibition , but not quite in the way the museum ' s proselytizers had hoped it would . Its acceptance was fueled less by esthetics than by the economics of the postwar years , as glass curtain walls finally became cheaper than masonry , and as the decline in craftsmanship made it seem financially prudent to join the parade against ornament . By 1950 modern architecture had become the American corporate style , its clean , sparse lines ideally suited to the cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as the style grew , however , it became harder and harder to tell what was the International Style and what wasn ' t . By the late 1950 ' s we were seeing not only more and more weak imitations of International Style masters - the kind of bargain-basement Mies van der Rohe that fills Third Avenue - but also the flamboyant shapes of Eero Saarinen , whose picturesque architecture at its best has an appealing stage-set quality ; the decorative modernism of Minoru Yamasaki and Edward Durell Stone , who tried to break away from the International Style toward a delicate , rather prissy kind of architecture ; and the powerful imagery of Kevin Roche , whose buildings back then had a strong , almost brutal sculptural quality to them. // So there was considerable diversity in modernism - modern buildings were more than just the products of the single-minded , narrow dogma of the International Style itself . But there was a kind of hubris to all of this architecture , a certainty that it represented the right way , the one true way to the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not encompass all that modern architecture was about , it certainly exemplified modernism ' s hubris . Nowhere but here did there seem to be such narrow dictates , nowhere but with the gurus of the International Style was there so much concern with pronouncing buildings acceptable or unacceptable. // And this is where the Museum of Modern Art exhibition played a major role - it presented what amounted to a set of rules for the making of modern architecture . There was a right way , which was to create buildings that fit into a particular esthetic , and a wrong way , which was to do anything else . The International Style was never really about much of anything except esthetics anyway , in the end . There was much talk about social responsibility , and about using new technology and modern materials , but these factors could never hold a candle to the question of how a building looked. // It is the very notion that there could be such simple rights and wrongs that dates the International Style to us today , far more , even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who brought the style into being in the 1920 ' s and 30 ' s deeply believed that the new architecture would bring about the good life for everyone ; it was not for nothing that Richard Neutra called his Lovell House the " Health House . " In so doing he was expressing the feelings of many of his colleagues , who were certain that the clean lines of modernism would in themselves improve society. // That esthetics alone could do this is something almost no one , not even our most zealous architects , believes any more . We ask of our architecture today something much more particular , something much less moralistic . We expect it to shelter us and , quite frequently , we expect it also to please and even entertain us . At its best - when its aspirations to art are the most serious - we hope that it will uplift us . But we still do not look to it for a cleansing of the soul ; neither do we look to it for a sense of absolutes. // And thus there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of style at all . Our best architects are divided between those who seem to be taking some modernist themes - a sense of sleekness and abstraction - and using them in a far more decorative and playful way than the International Style architects did , and those who are trying to reject all that modernism has been about and bring into their work the very aspects of historical architectural style that the International Style rejected . ( Philip Johnson , of course , has kept his career on the cutting edge by leapfrogging over the heads of his younger colleagues to begin designing such eclectic buildings himself . ) But with either of today ' s groups , the ones we might call late modernists and the ones who have become known as post-modernists , the cue is a kind of realism - a realistic attitude about what architecture can and can not do , about what its limits should be . We do not look to architecture to save the world , as the makers of the International Style did. // It is perhaps no accident that 50 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those architects with whom the International Style ' s practicioners felt in deepest competition , the eclectic architects of the 1920 ' s , is riding a crest of popularity . The picturesque , relaxed and easy Georgian mansions of Delano &; Aldrich , the sumptuous Renaissance buildings of McKim , Mead &; White , the lush Gothic of James Gamble Rogers are all very much in fashion now . They are admired by historians and , more significantly , they are imitated by younger , post-modern architects. // The best eclecticism of the 20 ' s and 30 ' s was an architecture of a certain ease , a certain self-indulgent but not unsophisticated pleasure . It displays far more knowledge of what makes buildings physically and emotionally comfortable than the International Style was ever able to do . But what makes eclectism most appealing right now is that it is an architecture without dogma - an architecture without a rigid ideology to foist upon the world . The International Style was a kind of missionary architecture , and it is that , more than anything else , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
