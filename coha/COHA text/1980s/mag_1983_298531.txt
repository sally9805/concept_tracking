Bungling the Donovan case <P> The interim report of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee investigating the confirmation of Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan was damaging enough . The 46-page text , which was issued last week , accused FBI Director William Webster and then Executive Assistant Director Francis Mullen of withholding information that raised serious questions about Donovan 's fitness for office . As a result , the committee charged , the FBI " usurped the Senate 's constitutional responsibility " and " compromised the Senate 's ability to inform itself . " <P> But the documents and testimony buried in the report 's 885-page appendix are potentially more embarrassing . They directly contradict an internal FBI memo of December 1980 , in which Webster revealed that he had assured Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese that the bureau 's 60 field offices had run a check on Donovan and turned up no incriminating evidence . In a letter to the Labor Committee dated Sept. 17 , 1982 , Assistant U.S. Attorney General Robert McConnell said that the FBI had " located no information to suggest that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own testimony before the Labor Committee , Mullen also contradicted his boss , saying that at the time of Webster 's assertion , the field offices had not been asked about Donovan . <P> Mullen 's testimony cast doubt , as well , on his own statement in January 1981 that the bureau had " no information which would reflect unfavorably upon Mr. Donovan in any manner . " This clean bill persuaded the Labor Committee to recommend that Donovan be confirmed . The full Senate approved Donovan in February 1981 , but inquiries continued . When a special prosecutor concluded last year that there was " insufficient credible evidence " to indict Donovan , the President proclaimed the case " closed . " But evidence that the FBI had withheld information linking Donovan 's old firm , Schiavone Construction Co. , to organized crime prompted Labor Committee Members Orrin Hatch and Edward Kennedy last July to order an investigation into the handling of his confirmation . <P> The committee found that significant information was held back not only by the FBI but also by Presidential Counsel Fred Fielding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " favorable and complete " but , according to Hatch , failed to mention a later FBI document describing alleged links between Donovan , Schiavone and the Mob . <P> The Labor Committee noted a number of specific allegations that the FBI did not pass along to the Senate . These included : six mentions of Donovan picked up by wire taps on the telephone of William Masselli , a reputed member of the Genovese crime family in New York ; references to Schiavone Construction in the agency 's files on the disappearance of former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa ; and reports from FBI informants that Donovan and Schiavone may have had ties to organized crime through the firm 's dealings with the Big J Trucking Co.
