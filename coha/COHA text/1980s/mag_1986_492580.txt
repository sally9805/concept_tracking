METOMAL AIILT3OX by A Capitol Idea Dear Dr. SerVaas : I am writing to congratulate you on the magnificent service you are providing to the women of the Washington , D.C. , metropolitan area with your Mammobile . Your educational and diagnostic services are contributing in a very Judith L. Bader , M.D. Principal Investigator NCI Early Breast Cancer Trial Radiation Oncology Branch , NCI Bethesda , Maryland ? ' . and from Virginia Dear Dr. SerVaas : Just a great note of thanks for the free mammogram I received today  --  compliments of you and The Saturday Evening Post , CBN , and " Operation Blessing . " My appointment was at 2 p.m. , and this was the first mammogram I had ever had . A strange experience , but a good feeling to know I 've had this done . So many women were able to have this , because of you  --  first of all . They came in droves . ABC national news did an article tonight on TV , on mammograms . That was timing ! They stated that this usually runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina , only charges $27 and sees about 40 patients a day . Dr. Tim Johnson talked about how most doctors wo n't even suggest it to their patients and how it could save so many lives . He is ABC 's doctor-in-commentary , and you might want to get in touch with him to tell him what you are doing . I think Dr. Johnson and ABC would both be in. terested . Again , thanks for being a lifesaver . Ann Lokides Norfolk . Virginia Lending a Hand Recent articles in the medical literature have reported apparent links between psoriasis and the irritable-bowel diseases . This suggests there may be a causal relationship between these ailments that we would like to explore for our readers suffering from psoriasis . We would like all those who have psoriasis to write for our Colitis Club diet and questionnaire . After trying the diet for a month , we would like you to fill out the questionnaire and return it to us noting any improvement or changes in the psoriasis , arthritis , or other ailments . Please indicate your wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Colitis Club  --  psoriasis study , P.O. Box 567 , Indianapolis , IN 46206 . Malignant Melanoma " The Itch That Was Cancer " in the September Post reported the story of Gerald W. Malky , who credited our magazine with saving his life because of a previous " Medical Mailbox " article on melanoma . He told of a series of coincidences that led to the discovery of his melanoma : The Post had been one of several magazines he had bought while on vacation ; he had selected the Post to read one night when he could n't sleep ; and the magazine had opened to the article illustrated with a melanoma . It matched exactly the mole on his back . Successfully removed 12 years ago , the malignancy had not returned . Now the Post has come to the rescue again . Malky explains in his phone call : " My wife was reading my story in the magazine and looking at the melanoma illustration , when suddenly she exclaimed : ' My God , you 've got another one of those things on your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't have one that looked just like the first one . It was low on my back , not where it could easily be seen . It was incredible that she should spot it . " To make a long story short , I went to a skin specialist . He removed the mole , and I got the biopsy report back today . It was a Level 1 melanoma , and malignant . Your magazine has done it again . " Malky told us he has already met with a plastic surgeon , and the day he phoned , a bigger section was being taken off . But the good news is , both doctors say it looks as if the melanoma is a superficial growth . " It was just lucky my wife discovered it , " he says , " because after 12 years , to tell you the truth , I 've been rather lax about it . " Fire Up for Fire Prevention October is the month for the observance of Fire Prevention Week in the United States . This year it is from October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that includes October 9 and marks the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 . During this week think about some fire facts . In 1984 , 4,075 people died in home fires and 18,750 were injured . The U.S. home-fire death rate remains among the highest in the Western world . Roughly half the fatal fires in the United States each year are due to careless use of lighted cigarettes . Three out of four U.S. households now have smoke or heat detectors  --  but only one of three has an escape plan to put into effect when the alarm goes off . Here are some suggestions for the proper observance of Fire Prevention Week . Install a smoke detector in your home , or check the batteries of the one you already have . Do the same with fire extinguishers and do not be afraid to drop into your fire station if you do n't know how to useone . Develop an escape plan with the entire family and then practice it . Arrange for a place to meet on the outside of the building so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building . Teach children how to call the fire department both quickly and promptly . Work with the entire family on the " stop , drop , and roll " technique for putting out clothing fires . One last suggestion . Take a few minutes to say a prayer for the 122 firefighters who died in the line of duty during 1985 . It has been estimated that more than half of these deaths came from tobacco related fires . Sulfites on Foods The Food and Drug Administration 's recent ban on sulfites applies only to their use as preservatives on fresh fruit and vegetables and apparently does not include other uses of the compound in canned foods and medications . Potatoes were specifically excluded . Shrimp are almost always treated with sulfites . Colitis Club Clamor Dear Dr. SerVaas : In the July/August issue , my husband and I have noticed some references to a colitis diet in letters to the editor . Where can we obtain a copy of the diet and information about the Colitis Club ? My husband suffers from colitis , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garner Havelock , North Carolina Dear Dr. SerVaas : I 'm interested in the Colitis Club diet . I have an irritated-bowel syndrome and I 'm overweight , so I 'm also interested in Dr. Katahn 's Rota-lion Diet . I have other problems , such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids , and although I 've had surgery , my problems persist . I 've been told that losing weight would help . I take Levsin for the IBS , but it seems to stimulate my appetite . I would like to get off of it by following your diet . Marguerite R. Busk Groveport , Ohio Dear Dr. SerVaas : I would appreciate it very much if I could get a copy of your irritable-bowel disease diet . This is the only time I 've encountered anyone who understands and is trying to alleviate this miserable , though admittedly non-life-threatening , problem . Dorothy D. Hove Story City , Iowa The Colitis Club is sending you a copy of its diet . Bran-New Info Dear Dr. SerVaas : In the May/June 1986 issue of The Saturday Evening Post there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You made a note that you were sending information on this to the writer . My brother and his wife are both diabetic  --  could you please send me information on this ? Beulah F. Parr Hyattsville , Maryland We are sending you information about Dr. Anderson 's work with diabetes and oat bran . He also uses other water-soluble fiber foods to help lower insulin requirements for diabetics . The following correspondence from Dr. Anderson will be of interest : " Our research shows that oat bran works as a part of the diet to improve blood-glucose control in diabetes . " Our studies with oat bran and blood cholesterol indicate that 50 grams ( 1 1/2 ounces ) of oat bran daily lowers blood cholesterol about 20 percent . This amount of oat bran can be consumed in two oat-bran muffins or in two bowls of oat-bran cereal . This amount of oat bran would probably improve blood-glucose control for persons with diabetes .

Would you please let me know where and how I could obtain this product ? Antoinette Brill New Lebanon , New York We have had many requests from people who want to try this product and are n't able to find it . We have arranged with the company that developed the product for Dr , Charles Pak to send us a supply for our members . Anyone wishing to try Citracal may obtain a sample by writing to Citracal , The Saturday Evening Post Society , P.O. Box 1144 , Indianapolis , IN 46206 .

Within the last six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . ) Four years ago I had open-heart surgery . They replaced the mitral valve with a pig 's valve . My doctor wo n't allow me to take calcium because it might lodge in the valve . Does this hold true also for Citracal ? Please advise . Could I have a copy of the colitis diet ? I also wish to know how to buy the corn-meal and bran products through the Post . Nancy Rinaldi Poughkeepsie , New York We 're forwarding your inquiry to Dr. Charles Pak , who may be able to answer your question about calcium and your mitral-valve replacement . You may obtain the high-lysine corn meal and bran products packaged by the Society by joining Partners in Research , 1100 Waterway Blvd. , Indianapolis , IN 46206 . The Colitis Club is sending you a copy of its diet . Tastes Great ! Dear Dr. SerVaas : My husband and I enjoy your magazine . The high-lysine corn meal is used at present for an addition to my husband 's cereal . He takes a high-fiber cereal , adds the corn meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats it in the microwave at six in the morning . It makes for a good start for the day . Margaret /V . Burnett Hercules , California Filipino Fill-up Dear Dr. SerVaas : I got your address through the local telecast of the " 700 Club . " I just want to inform you that some Filipinos are taking a local medication to get rid of kidney disease . I do not know if former President Marcos has done it , but based on my experience I can attest that this local practice is effective . I have had several kidney infections , and they were so severe that I had to cry in pain . They said , according to the folks , drinking the liquid of a young coconut is very effective in this kind of disease . So , we got three young coconuts fresh from the farm . For three mornings , I had the coconut therapy early in the morning before even drinking a glass of water . But I did not drink water but only the coconut liquid for three consecutive mornings . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also read in a national newspaper that a medical practitioner in Manila is doing this kind of therapy among his clients . Angelina Santos-Ronghanoy Philippines Squealing on Tinnitus Dear Dr. SerVaas : I read the letters in the Post and think they bring certain problems before the public , so I 'm asking you to print mine as soon as possible and bring the subject of tinnitus into the public awareness . Tinnitus , a condition afflicting millions of people in this country , is a noise in the ear that can vary from a low roar to a squeal or whine . There is no escape from it . It is not audible to others , so friends and workers are not usually aware of the stress the individual is constantly under . Perhaps there are research centers where people are working to find a cause and a cure , but they are not publicized , so sufferers still do n't have advice on how to deal with their problem . Ronnie L. Lemke La Crosse , Wisconsin There are many possible causes of tinnitus ( or ringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking too much aspirin , easily treated by cutting back or switching to another type of pain reliever . If your doctor prescribed aspirin specifically , talk it over with hint or her first . As mentioned in the September issue , MAiere 's disease can also cause tinnitus . In this disease , there is also a tendency to become dizzy , and the tinnitus is often restricted to only one ear . A third possibility is labyrinthine disease ( L.D. ) , which refers to a malfunction of the inner ear usually diagnosed due to deafness , nausea and vomiting , blurring vision , and a loss of balance . L.D. can be caused by an infection of the middle ear , trauma to the head causing hemorrhage or splitling of the labyrinth , cardiovascular disease such as arteriosclerosis or blood-vessel disturbances and blood abnormalities . If the underlying cause can be determined , it is often treatable . Tinnitus can also be caused by exposure to loud noises . Working in a noisy factory , turning up stereos too loud , or any other abuse of the ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often mandated that above certain levels of noise , ear protection must be worn . No matter what the cause of the problem , have your physician follow up on it . Ignoring the situation could cost you your hearing . Exchange Studeni Dear Dr. SerVaas : The exchange of medical information via this column and your whole magazine is a powerful source of good . I am hoping you will see fit to publish this letter , as I have a devastating health problem for which I have always secretly thought there was probably a simple cure . I know so many others who suffer with this , but probably not to the magnitude I have endured . Twenty-seven years ago , when I was 27 and pregnant for the first time , I was given a DES shot to stop miscarriage . Immediately I developed a horrible vaginal yeast infection . It has raged on for all these many years with rare times of semi-remission . I have had every appropriate test , such as for diabetes , plus allergy tests and allergy shots that were to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . I now live in a hot climate , but the problem is no different than when I lived in a cold climate . I have become allergic to most prescription products , which do n't effect a cure , anyway . I wear cotton underwear , cotton-crotch panty hose , have never used colored toilet paper , etc. , and use good hygiene . At one time , long ago , I read an obscure paragraph which Allied , " Vitamin E was helpful to victims of cystic mastitis . " Even though my doctor was not impressed . I immediately began vitamin-E therapy and can happily tell you the mastitis went away ; there is NO sign of it . I continue to take it and recommend it for cystic mastitis . I mention this because I wonder if there is some similar , simple therapy for this most painful , agonizing personal health problem , i.e. , yeast infection . 1 am literally at my wit 's end ! Anonymous Saint Petersburg , Florida Lack of Lactose Dear Dr. SerVaas : I am very grateful for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My obvious symptoms were diarrhea and gas , but I really had no idea that milk and fruit and corn products were contributing so greatly . But I 'm here to tell you that it truly works for me . My daughter is a dietician in a large hospital . She is very interested in your program and in the help it has been for me . If you have anything in print that I can share with her , I will be happy to forward it to her . Ginger N. Hadley Dunnellon , Florida Many Colitis Club members can add milk to their diets by taking Lac-laid , which replaces the missing enzyme ( called " lactase " ) in those who ca n't tolerate milk products . Further information is being sent . Some people lack this digestive enzyme known as lactase . Without this enzyme , they are unable to digest some or all of the lactose sugar found in milk . This causes a wide range of problems including gas , severe cramping , and diarrhea . Lactaid is an over-the-counter additive put into regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lactose sugar into the simple , more digestible sugars glucose and galactose . This is currently available in liquid and tablet forms . The makers of Lactaid are beginning to market a line of dairy products with the lactase added during the manufacturing process so that it does n't have to be done just before use . Called by the brand name " CalciMilk , " the product is regular low-fat milk with the enzyme already included . According to the manufacturer , CalciMilk can be used out of the container just like regular milk in cooking and baking . In addition , it has 66 percent more calcium than is found in nontreated milk . Two glasses supply 100 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance of the mineral . Further information on both products is available from Lactaid , Inc. , 1.11.11.1111.1=1110 ? // P.O. Box III , Pleasantville , NJ 08232 . The organization also has a toll-free number available , 1-800-257-8560 ; in New Jersey call ( 609 ) 645-7500 . Both numbers are manned between 9 a , m. and 4 p.m . Eastern time . Instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Patterson , March ' 86 Post , regarding intestinal gas . I too had this condition so badly I could hardly sit in church or any meeting . I had a barium enema , etc. ; nothing was found . so I started thinking about what I was having that I did n't previously . The culprit was instant coffee ! There is a volatile oil I did n't digest . What a relief ! No instant coffee for me ! Regarding severe halitosis , stop drinking milk and cut way back on ice cream , etc . It sure worked for my husband . Fran Liska Traverse City , Michigan Breathing Easy Again Dear Dr. SerVaas : I had a close call with malignant hyperthermia as an outpatient in August 1985 , after Valium and a general inhalation anesthetic were administered . I was told it caused respiratory arrest . Immediate CPR was given . I also had a similar but mild experience with Novocaine given for dental work , although at the time , they called it an " anxiety attack . " Lucille Puller Conroe , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Berton Roueche ' May/June , ' 86J was an enlightening article . Even I , at 74 , a relatively sound mountain trekker , am infrequently afflicted with hiccups . Perhaps the best hiccup cure is to swallow one teaspoon of dry , granulated sugar . So advised Dr. Edgar G. Engle-man of Stanford University , early in 1981 . He tried the remedy on 20 patients , 8 of whom had been hiccuping for periods ranging from one day to six weeks . It worked in 19 out of the 20 cases . Martin Elliott Thomas Sacramento , California Cooperstown continued from page 103 Field features an annual major league " Hall of Fame Game , " in which teams from the National and American leagues perform for 10,000 fans . The small field , in contrast to today 's urban multipurpose athletic complexes , gives viewers the impression of returning to the " good ole days " when ballparks were an integral part of most communities . James Fenimore Cooper predicted in 1838 that the village would become " . . . no mushroom city " but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as a " resort for the inhabitants of the large towns during the warm months . " He was right . The village , bypassed by canals and railroads in the 19th century and by superhighways in the 20th , has never grown larger than 2,800 souls , but its fame has spread far beyond its village limits . Even its medical center , the Imogene Bassett Hospital , has been described by the Carnegie Commission as a model of rural health care . So if you eat too much popcorn and Cracker Jack , there 's a place to go . This year , Cooperstown celebrates its 200th anniversary . The town has rolled out the red carpet to celebrate its founding in 1786 by William Cooper . Festivals and parades , bazaars and picnics , have added to the charm of the village . On December 22 , a candlelight procession to the flagpole on Main Street will mark the end of the bicentennial as townspeopie dedicate a time capsule . If you missed Cooperstown this year , there will always be next summer , when you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the thousands of previous visitors have found it .
