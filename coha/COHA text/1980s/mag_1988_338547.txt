Los Angeles restaurants are placing a picture of a glass of water on diners ' tables instead of the real thing . Ohio 's Governor Richard Celeste , surveying his once lush farm fields , sadly compares them to " sand dunes . " In the South , where all outdoor watering has been banned , residents are using " gray water "  --  what is left after bathing and showering  --  to sprinkle plants and flowers . Along the normally wet Columbia River basin in Washington and Oregon , there is not enough water to irrigate all the fruit orchards . <P> It is not the Dust Bowl yet , but the country 's midsection and parts of the South and the Great Plains are suffering through the worst drought since 1934 , when farmers in protective masks watched as whole fields of crops simply blew away . Without substantial rainfall soon , Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said , the country 's farms could become a national disaster . <P> The weather report is not encouraging . Says National Weather Service Meteorologist Lyle Alexander : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower activity . " The spring wheat crop in the northern Great Plains could be salvaged if rains come in the next week or two , but a large high-pressure ridge makes that unlikely . Crops are surviving now on moisture stored in the soil . " There 's about two minutes left in the game , " says County Agent Carl Wilbourn of Leflore County , Miss . " But there 's still a chance .

The sudden glut of meat on the market has caused hog prices to fall 10% in the past three weeks and feeder-cattle prices to plunge 9% in five weeks ; even so , consumers will soon face higher food costs . <P> The drought is also depleting rivers , lakes and canals , ruining recreation areas and threatening inland transportation . On the Great Lakes , ships are carrying 5% lighter loads . River gridlock has hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest point on record , 1,200 barges were stranded after they ran aground at Greenville , Miss . According to Michael Logue , spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers , twice as many barges could become mired this week , creating the aquatic equivalent of a " traffic jam of semitrucks bumper to bumper from New Orleans to Philadelphia . " <P> Fire is an ever present danger . Lightning in the eastern Sierra Nevada has sparked more than 80 fires . In Wisconsin , where 87 fires charred 250 acres last week , the state has ordered a ban on all types of outdoor fires , including barbecues and cigarette smoking , in rural areas .
