Everybody who is somebody has got to take a hit now and then . When you are famous , people start rehashing your sex life , and , first thing you know , your reputation goes down the tube and your nomination with it . Happens all the time . Gary Hart . John Tower . Aphrodite . <P> Yes , fabled Golden Aphrodite ! Also known as Kallipygos ( Beautiful Buttocks ) . Borne full-blown from the sea ( aphros means foam ; - dite rhymes with nightie ) . Worshiped for centuries by amorous couples coupling clamorously . She was Homer 's Goddess of Pure and Heavenly Love , but we forget that Homer was blind . So , alas , are we . Turns out that Aphrodite ( Venus to you Romans ) was not Ms. Clean at all but the Goddess of Naughty Sex . It is she we can thank for most + of mankind 's sexual problems , and chief among these is our obsession with her elusive elixir , the aphrodisiac . <P> Nothing is safe from her depredations , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poachers accused of slaughtering hundreds of black bears in the Northeastern U.S. , ripping out their gallbladders and selling them for profit . The gallbladders are dried and ground into powder and sent to Asia , where they are sold for as much as $540 an oz. for " medicinal " purposes . Men who take a tiny pinch of the powder are convinced that it enhances their libido . They believe that if you devour parts of a powerful animal , you will absorb its sexual vitality . And if bear gallbladder fails , they will contrive potions and lotions from the hump of the camel , the penis of the tiger or the horn of the rhinoceros . <P> So it was Aphrodite who led us on . For starters , according to one account , she was created from the genitals of the god Uranus , who had been hurled , dismembered , into the sea by his ill-tempered son Cronus . Her husband was Hephaestus , blacksmith to the gods and the ugliest fellow in the pantheon . This may explain why Aphrodite lost no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few surprised mortals , among them an obscure shepherd or two . It is no wonder that Aphrodite should continue to be so seductive even to this day . Underachieving , oversexed men  --  and for that matter overachieving , undersexed men  --  keep pounding at this hussy 's door , and she is always at home . <P> Her earliest visitors , the ancient Greeks and Romans , tried just about any concoction to have their way with her . A scholarly study on the subject by Alan Hull Walton tells us that the pith from the branch of the pomegranate tree and the testes of animals were considered hot stuff . So were certain foods . " If envious age relax the nuptial knot , " advised the poet Martial , " thy food be scallions , and thy feast shallot . " Onions were a favorite , as were garlic , pepper , savory , cabbage , asparagus , eggs , pineapples , snails ( " but without sauce , " cautioned the fastidious Petronius ) and just about any creature dredged from Aphrodite 's watery birthplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
