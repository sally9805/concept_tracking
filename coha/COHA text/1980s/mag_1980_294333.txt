In the " Hillside Strangler " case , shrinks , as usual , differ <P> By the time his lawyer began plea-bargaining last October , the hard evidence was there . Kenneth Bianchi , 27 , a Bellingham , Wash. , security guard was in deed the Hillside Strangler , responsible for the murder of ten young women in Los Angeles from September 1977 to February 1978 - as well as two later killings in Washington that resulted in his arrest . <P> Did Bianchi act cold-bloodedly ? Or was he the victim of a Jekyll-and-Hyde dual personality ? Psychologist John Watkins , recommended by the defense , put Bian chi under hypnosis and elicited a confession from a sneering Mr. Hyde character who called himself " Steve Walker . " But the mystery of Bianchi 's supposed multiple personality became irrelevant when he avoided the death sentence by pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his cousin and alleged accomplice , Angelo Buono . That plea rendered Bianchi competent in the eyes of the law . It also earned him six concurrent and two consecutive life sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excerpts of video-taped sessions with Bianchi , involving Watkins and five psychiatrists ( the judge picked all the experts , including two nominated by the defense , two by the prosecution ) . What the tapes made clear was that the shrinks were , as usual , divided . Two believed that Bianchi did indeed have a multiple personality , two were certain that he was lying , and two could not be sure . That raised further questions not only about Bianchi but about the role that psychiatrists should play in the courtroom . <P> In one of the tapes , Bianchi , under hypnosis , revealed his painful childhood : his adoptive mother , alternately seductive and sadistic , punished him by holding his hand over the stove , physically beating him and forcing him , at age 14 , to pray over his dead adoptive father 's body for a week as it lay in its coffin . Watkins feels that such experiences made Bianchi a multiple personality . So does Psychiatrist Ralph Allison , who says he has studied some 50 multiple-personality cases . When asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bianchi , Allison said simply , " I met him . " <P> Psychiatrist Donald Lunde , recommended by the defense , agrees that Bianchi clearly went through a repression of great hostility toward his adoptive mother . But a multiple personality ? Lunde is uncertain . Part of his doubt stems from viewing the tapes . " At times , " he says , " there are serious questions of whether hypnosis is really going on . There 's a possibility that Watkins suggested the presence of other personalities . He asks questions early on that provide a kind of guidance . In one tape , he even says , ' If there is some other part of you that wants to talk to me , I 'm here to talk to you . ' "
