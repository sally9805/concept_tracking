Bobby Jones teed up , squinting up the fairway into the early morning light to gauge the distance to the pin . He then addressed the ball and sent a screamer arching to within an easy chip shot of the green . Barely smiling , he stepped off to the side to watch his partners drive . // Next came Bobby Jones , who shuffled nervously before hooking his tee shot into the rough on the left side of the fairway . He tittered a bit in embarrassment . // The third man on the tee was Bobby Jones , who took a deep breath , drawing in his potbelly so that he could see the ball , took a mighty swing  --  and watched his ball dribble off into a clump of weeds not 10 yards away . He did not smile . // And finally Bobby Jones stepped up and sliced one off into the heavens . The shot was last seen as it flew behind some trees that masked a water hazard . // That done , the four Bobby Joneses climbed into their golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Joneses were waiting to tee off , while the four Bobby Joneses up ahead were already out of sight . // No , this was n't a case of multiple vision , or even some hallucination brought on by that late-summer disease called Links Fever . Rather it was the Third Annual Bobby Jones Open golf tournament , at the Tyrone Hills Golf Club in Fenton , Mich. , a suburb of Detroit . There 32 men named Bob Jones gathered some months ago to see who could come closest in golfing skill to their famous forebear of the 1920s  --  Robert Tyre Jones Jr. , arguably the greatest American golfer and winner of 13 national championships in a scant eight years , a feat as yet unmatched by mere Palmers , Nicklauses and Watsons . // At Tyrone Hills one could see all sorts of Bob Joneses . Tall ones and short ones , fat ones and thin ones , some dark and balding , some fair and hirsute , ranging in age from 20 to 65 , in occupation from banker and adman to songwriter and housebuilder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , since I 'm a Bob Jones myself , let 's say " in need of some coaching . " // The Bobby Jones Open is the brainchild of Robert A. Jones , 45 , of Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , president of a small computer programming and consulting company called Computer Dynamics , Inc . Tall and bustling , with the bushy dark eyebrows characteristic of his Welsh heritage , Computer Bob , as he came to be called among the Jones boys , is admittedly no match in golfing skill for his illustrious clansman . " I 'm an 18 handicap  --  but I love the game , " he says with a grin . " Back in the spring or early summer of 1979 it occurred to me that maybe there were other golf-playing Bob Joneses who would like to get together and see what we all looked like . I began searching the Detroit-area phone book for Bob Joneses and calling them up , but with little luck initially . Then I went to the Golf Association of Michigan , which represents 70 private clubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership . Finally I began Xeroxing town phone directories in the region , put the Bob Jones numbers into a data processing system  --  I love to play with computers  --  and now I 've got more than 300 names on my master list . " // That first tournament , in 1979 , played in cold , blustery weather at the Pine Lake Country Club in the swank Detroit suburb of Orchard Lake , drew only five Bob Joneses , all from the immediate area . The following year , at Tyrone Hills , 18 showed up , again all locals attracted by the publicity the tourney was beginning to attract . This year , thanks largely to a story that appeared in the Wall Street Journal the week before the tournament , Bob Joneses came from as far away as Massachusetts in the East and Minnesota in the West . " Next year , by golly , maybe we 'll get a Bob Jones from England or Wales , " says Computer Bob . " We 've already had an inquiry from Surrey , England , right near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem an organizer faces when confronted with a full platoon of Bob Joneses is , of course , communication . You ca n't just say , " Hey , Bob , you 're away . " Or , " Bob , you 're going to be matched with Bob Jones here , and then there 's Bob Jones and Bob Jones to round out your foursome . " Middle initials do n't work either , because there were at least a couple of nearly every popular middle initial in the alphabet at the tournament . " We decided finally to identify everyone by his occupation or place of residence , " said Computer Bob . As a result , the roster of players included Pontiac Bob and Valu-Rite Bob , 3-D Bob and Power Jet Bob , Standard Oil Bob and Federal Pipe Bob . There was one Greenbaum Bob from the law firm of Greenbaum , Greenbaum &amp; Gold . A Minnesota Orchestra Bob , who serves as general manager for that renowned musical assembly . A Paragon Bob , whose moniker derived from the advertising agency he owns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No-Sag Bob , winner on low gross score of the first two Bobby Jones Opens . // An employee of the No-Sag Springs Division of the Lear-Siegler Corp . at the time of those first two tournaments , No-Sag Bob , 37 , of Ferndale , Mich. , has since changed jobs , moving to the Republic Steel Corp. , where he works as a salesman . But Republic Bob does n't have quite the ring of No-Sag Bob , so the new handle has n't caught on . No-Sag is a wide-shouldered , mustachioed , unpretentious fellow who took up golf at age 29 . Possessed of a rocketing drive , his short game  --  irons and putter  --  needs a lot of work , as he 's the first to admit . " I 'll have a hard time defending the title , " he allowed the night before the tournament . He warily eyed the other Bob Joneses milling about the bar of the Ramada Inn at Southfield during the traditional pre-match , pay-for-your-own cocktail party . " I hear there 's a real Bobby Jones here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Indiana Jones , Raider of the Lost Par ! He proved to be a tall , putter-slim , dark-haired man of 43 with calm blue-gray eyes that seemed to match , in both color and confidence , those of The Great B.J. himself . " Yep , " he said . " I 'm a five handicap and I play a lot of golf . I grew up a seven-iron shot from a golf course in Union Mills , Ind. , where I 'm a general contractor for the firm of Tonn &amp; Blank . Actually I 'm what you 'd call a mechanical design engineer  --  at least that 's what the degree reads that they give me from college . Here 's my card . " // Deadpan , he hands it over . Beside a drawing of a golfer in midswing who closely resembles Indiana himself , the text on the card reads : // " Due to the fact that I will be knocking off around noon to play golf , I wo n't have time to call on you again this summer . Please mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the fall , kissing your ass as usual . " // Yes , indeed , a dedicated linksman . Indiana and his wife , Sandy , had driven the 260 miles from Union Mills to Tyrone Hills and the following day would drive right back to play together in another match down home . // At the cocktail party , it was rather eerie to be standing in the midst of a group of men who all bore my name . Despite the disparity in our ages , looks and occupations , I found a number of things we all had in common . First and foremost was a distaste , if not an outright hatred , for the name Bobby . The Great Man himself shared this repugnance : He absolutely insisted on being called Bob by his family and friends . The despicable diminutive had been pinned on him by the British sporting press , which labeled him Bonnie Bobby during his first appearance in Great Britain in 1921 . When Jones 's infamous bad temper made itself evident  --  he was an inveterate club thrower  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runnerup at the party to Bobby in the **44;712;TOOLONG handicap was the equally cheesy appellation Jonesy , a nomenclatural cross all members of our clan , regardless of sex or given name , must bear . " It 's too damned cute , " said Bear Mountain Bob , a burly B.J. from Vermont . " But what can you do ? People mean well when they call you Jonesy , so you ca n't very well punch ' em out . " // All Joneses present also could do without the banalities attached to the name . We 're tired of all you Smiths and Greens and McGillicuddys keeping up with us , sick unto death  --  the boys , at least  --  of having the whole town talkin ' about us . And there 's no need to tell us , as Irving Berlin so stridently insisted during World War II , that " This is the Army , Mr. Jones . " After all , it 's more than 200 years since an illustrious , military Jones told the captain of the British frigate Serapis that " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we 're on the subject of calumny and clichs , all Joneses worthy of the name resent the common belief that theirs is the commonest surname in America . Not by a long shot ! That honor belongs to those unfortunate enough to be named Smith . Indeed , Jones is only the fourth most common name in this sweet land of liberty . There are many more Johnsons and Williamses than there are Joneses. // Toward the end of the cocktail party , I found myself talking to Gretchen Jones , the wife of Greenbaum Bob , whose maiden name was Larsen . I decided it was a good time to bring up Famous Joneses Through History and I ticked off a few of my favorites for her : John Paul , Parnelli , Inigo , Jesse , Jennifer , Shirley , Carolyn , Buck , Buffalo , James , Too Tall and Deacon . // Gretchen Larsen Jones nodded politely when I finished . " What about Tom Jones  --  the singer , not Fielding 's Tom ? " she asked . // " A poseur , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No real-life Jones would ever wear clothes like that . " // " And LeRoi , the playwright ? " // " Changed his name to Baraka , " I replied . " A turncoat , at least in nomenclature , rather like that Henry Jones of Victorian England who used the name Cavendish to write his treatises on the game of whist . He was quite famous in his own time , but none of it accrued to us Joneses . Still , I learned how to play whist from his book The Laws and Principles of Whist , first published in 1862 , but later to go through many more editions . " // " Yup , " said Gretchen . She gazed around at the other Bob Joneses chatting merrily with one another , oblivious to the Great Joneses of the Past . Clearly Gretchen knew I 'd temporarily run out of Joneses . Not that she felt let down . // " Listen , " I asked her . " Why do you think all these Bob Joneses are here to play in this tournament ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just emerged from a stale Welsh rarebit and said , " It 's pretty obvious , is n't it ? You 're all making up for The Name . " // Tee-off time on Saturday was 8:02 a.m. , and the weather was fair , a bit cool , with dew beaded bright and shimmering on the greens of Tyrone Hills . Detroit loomed off to the southeast , marked by a yellow-brown mushroom of smog from which , faint as distant birdsong , emerged the occasional wail of a police siren and the crackle of what sounded like small-arms fire . The birds on the golf course were few and far between , though the Little Blue Heron seemed much in evidence as the day progressed  --  proof of a plenitude of frogs in the course 's weedy water hazards . Golf puts one in touch with nature . Then again , as the poet Sarah Norcliffe Cleghorn wrote in 1915 : " The golf links lie so near the mill/ That almost every day/ The laboring children can look out And watch the men at play . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's carouse . They showed up bright-eyed to take coffee , at 50 a cup , from a Silex of pale mud placed at the end of the Tyrone Hills bar . Approaching the first tee , we were greeted by an apparition of Bobby Jones himself : a sturdy young man , his hair parted down the middle , and dressed in gray knickers , white shirt , black tie , a blue cashmere V-necked sweater , black knee socks and golf shoes . He was n't , unfortunately , even a latter-day Bobby Jones . He was Rod Pattan , the official starter for the tournament . Still , in that early , almost foggy light , he added a fine touch of time-travel to the proceedings . // I had decided to follow the foursome containing Indiana Jones at least through the first nine , because it was clear from all accounts that he was the favorite . Indiana 's partners were Songwriter , Chrysler and Valu-Rite . Chrysler Bob , an older man ( 59 ) , but a game one , had played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pine Lake course the first year and a 101 last year on Tyrone Hills ' par-72 layout . Because the player 's gross score over 18 holes is adjusted by means of the Callaway Handicap System , which subtracts the scores of the worst individual holes during the first 16 holes from his total , he had ended up with a net total of 76 and 74  --  " Nothing to write home about , " Chrysler allowed gruffly , " but at my age I 'm happy with it . " Songwriter proved to be Robert F. Jones , 35 , of Maplewood , Minn. , a sandy-haired , soft-spoken lyricist  --  country &amp; western and rock , as yet unpublished but working " eight hours a day at it "  --  who had brought with him his girl friend , Cheryl , and his children from an earlier marriage , Wendy , 11 , and Michael , 6 . These loyal followers stayed with him all the way around the course and provided the only gallery of the day . Valu-Rite , or Robert M. of Cannon Falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1st hole but birdied the 2nd with a drive straight as a string , a nifty , lofting chip and a six-foot putt that dropped like the Lusitania . On the green , he marked his ball with an Australian penny , which he showed to me : " This way you do n't lose your marker , see ? People think it 's a manhole cover . " On the front of the well-worn coin was an engraving of King George VI and on the back , a kangaroo . " It 's clearly marked , heads and tails , " said Indiana with a chuckle . // After a few more holes I bade a fond farewell to that foursome and their threesome claque , as their carts chugged on over the ridge to fame or disaster . ( When I was a little shaver and my proud dad introduced me to his friends as Bobby Jones , they inevitably said , " You 're going to be a great golfer , kiddo . With that name , you ca n't fail ! " Something in their voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . Certainly not in golf. ) // The next Joneses to play through included one who was shooting a bright orange ball . This was Toyota Bob from Hanover , Mass. , a husky man of 37 who sells automobiles from Japan in Bean Town . I first became aware of him when his gaudy missile hissed over the green near which I stood and rolled down into the weeds on the far side . He stomped up to it , muttered something inelegant under his breath , and then knocked it back clear over the green . // " I love this game , " he told me . " Anybody got a beer ? " // At the end of the front nine , Indiana held the lead with a 38  --  two over the par 36 for that portion of the route . Already it was past noon and the sun had long since burned the cool from the course . Joneses staggered through the clubhouse , drinking water and soda pop to replenish their vital fluids , and then forged back out onto the links . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bogeys . He attacked the back nine with fully 20 cans of suds on his cart  --  some of it the payoff of a bet he 'd made with Greenbaum Bob . It was obvious that no one in this foursome would fall victim to the original Bobby Jones 's most invidious enemy , overdedication to the game . // At the 13th hole I caught up with Computer Bob . Still neat and tidy in his white polo shirt , reddish-orange pants and orange-rimmed visor , he seemed cheery and capable . He drove well on that 492-yard hole , and huzzahs rang from his partners . His second shot was well centered in the fairway , while his third took him to the edge to the green . It was a par-5 hole , and his lightly powered chip from the tall grass at the green 's edge carried straight  --  a full 15 feet  --  to the rim of the cup . There it spun and hung . Tapping it in for a par rather than a birdie , Computer shot his Welsh eyebrows up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings this group together , " he said . // As it turned out , Computer Bob  --  the Jones who brought us all together  --  shot the second best round of his life that day . He finished the 18 with a gross of 84 . Subtracting his Callaway handicap of 12 , he tied for second in the low-net category with a final score of 72 . Tied with him was First National Bob , a 66-year-old banker from Kearny , N.J. , who went out in 40 , came back in 39 and ended up  --  less his handicap of seven  --  with 72. // Low gross winner was the intrepid Indiana , who improved his front nine 38 by one stroke to win the biggest of the trophies  --  with a three-over-par 75 . It presented no difficulty , of course , to inscribe in advance the name of the winner on the statuette 's base . Subtracting Indiana 's Callaway handicap of three brought him down to 72. // Not quite enough for a double title , though . Low net went to West Virginia Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 became 71 after subtraction of his 14-stroke handicap . West Virginia Bob , 41 and a physical therapist , had quit work at 8 p.m. the night before and then driven 350 miles to play in the tournament . He had to leave right after finishing to head back to Huntington for Sunday morning church services . // The winner of the last two outings , No-Sag Bob from Ferndale , never got untracked . He shot a 49 and 46 and , with his 20 handicap , ended up at 75 . ( In the earlier tournaments , his raw scores had been 94 and 87. ) // Songwriter , whose tunes I soon hope to hear over my local airwaves , blew up on the back nine and finished with an 86 gross and a creditable 76 after handicap . // Toyota Bob , a bit beery-eyed at the end , hammered out a 98 , but the highest raw score of the day belonged to someone named Bob Jones , who shot a 115 . Nobody kidded him about it . // Later Toyota Bob and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the look-alike hamburger joints . Along the way he explained the difference between top-of-the-line Toyotas and the cut-rate numbers . // " What 's this one ? " I asked him as he turned it back into the rental agency at the airport . // " Damn near top of the line , " boasted Toyota Bob . // " Good for you , " I said . " Keeping up with the Joneses , eh ? " // He turned on me with a grim look  --  the same one I 've often used to impale jokesters. // " Them 's fightin ' words , " he said . Then his Jonesian face relaxed . " But I 'll consider the source . "
