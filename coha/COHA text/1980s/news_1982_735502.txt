txt It is probably a safe assumption that everyone is sated by television 's steady stream of bubblehead instant analysis of the election returns , and it is not a guess but a certainty that every editorial page in the country will be filled with wrongheaded interpretations of the results for several days to come . That being the case . I wo n't add my two cents-worth . Instead . in the interest of reintroducing us all to the world which exists across the waters , herewith a few reminders of what has been happening while America wrestled with its political future . It does n't make very happy reading . The Chinese and Russians have been playing cards ( you know , as in " playing Viewpoint by Hodding Carter III the China card " ) and seem to want to stay at the table for some time . Why the twohanded game has been resumed is not entirely clear , but Peking 's unhappiness with the president 's unwillingness to get off the two-China dime is a factor . Even a partial rapprochement between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation of the " who lost China ? " theme ) and dangerously alter the balance of power . The creative , firm American diplomacy required to deal with the situation has not been forthcoming . In southern Africa , it was not very long ago that even some liberal observers were expressing hope that the administration was actually going to pull off the long deferred independence of Namibia , which would have been a major coup . But South Africa has reverted to type and thrown a last-minute block into the plan by demanding that Cuban troops leave Angola before , or simultaneously with , the departure of South African troops from Namibia . Ourrepresentatives appear to have been at least partially sympathetic to the idea . which is a nonstarter on every count , and while there is a lot of scrambling going on , a settlement now also appears to be a nonstarter . At root , what is involved in South Africa is a variation on one of the Reagan administration 's favorite themes , which is that sugar and sweet rhetoric are the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the South Africans are busy demonstrating , the authoritarians find that fondly naive hope rather amusing , since they pocket the good will and go on about their murderous , racist or repressive way with little more than renewed lip service to the international anti-communist crusade . Chile , South Korea and the Philippines come to mind as other examples of the reality behind the pathetic delusion that quiet diplomacy ( another way of saying no real pressure ) can produce results . Repression in all three is either unchanged or worse since the new team came to power in Washington in 1981 . But the largest chicken hatched by the weak human rights policy favored by Washington these days has come home to roost in El Salvador . There , our ambassadorial viceroy has had to drop the pretense that a soft word beats a tough one when dealing with murderous thugs . Perhaps the State Department , having repeatedly mauled the facts to make a case to Congress for continued foreign aid for El Salvador , will follow the logic of Ambassador Hinton 's public remarks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several Americans and finally tell it the way it is . That in turn might finally lead to negotiations between the parties to the civil war and a possible resolution . But official Washington of 1982 professes to believe that you should never negotiate with communists and leftists ( unless they run Yugoslavia , China , the Soviet Union and a fewother places ) , so there is virtually no hope for an end to the fighting  --  and the indiscriminate killing . What also will go on into the indefinite future is the strangulation of democracy in Turkey . Our ambassador there has been a public and private cheerleader as the military junta has jailed former government leaders as well as terrorists , tortured widely and all too well , cracked down on legitimate trade unions and promulgated a draft constitution which would keep junta leader Gen. Kenan Evren as president for seven years . If the draft is approved in a referendum this Sunday , Gen. Evren said this week , no opponent will be allowed to stand against him because the Turkish people must be spared the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic choice apparently inspires " nervous tension " in the White House , where the silence on events in Turkey has been deafening . Indeed , a report prepared by the staff of the bipartisan Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe raises , very carefully and largely by implication , questions of American complicity in the military crackdown . All of which is enough to give some flavor of recent events , without discussing the not-well-disguised impasse in our important Middle Eastern initiative , the continuing disarray in the Western Alliance , the absolute deadlock in the arms control talks ( as attested by both sides ) and the grim specter of international economic collapse . On this post-election Thursday , it 's well to remember that they are all there , little affected or changed by Tuesday 's balloting . Skillful manipulation of 30-second spots wo n't help in their resolution .
