Soviet Dissident Iosif Begun has had a tumultuous year . Last February , after a series of public protests , the Soviet Union 's best-known refusenik was abruptly released from labor camp after serving 3 1/2 years on charges stemming from his activities as a Hebrew teacher . Last week Begun , 55 , again got some good news . Soviet authorities announced that they were approving his 16-year-old request to emigrate to Israel . <P> Begun 's elderly mother and his wife Inna will also be allowed to leave , along with more than a dozen other Soviet Jews who have been campaigning for exit permits for years . Moscow 's move is evidently intended to gain favor with the West in anticipation of a summit this fall between President Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
