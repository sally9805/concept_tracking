One recent morning , Federal Express stopped by my home and dropped off a two-foot-tall box labeled " dangerous goods . " Inside , I knew , was my shipment of Hot Scoop . It came packed in twenty pounds of dry ice and smoked as I lifted it from its styrofoam case . A dry-ice mist crept across the floor ? which was fitting , because Hot Scoop is one spooky product . It is a packaged hot-fudge sundae designed expressly for use in a microwave oven . The ice cream and fudge go into the oven together ; due to the kinky physics of microwaves , the ice cream stays cold , the fudge gets hot . The world gets a little braver . Hot Scoop , conceived by food engineers in Milwaukee and now being modified for release this summer by Steve 's Homemade Ice Cream , is one of a new generation of microwave foods that promise to change the tastes , scents , and textures of the things America eats and the way America eats them . These are brave new foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizzas . On store shelves , they resemble the usual processed foods ? except for a couple of wavy lines on the box and the word MICROWAVE printed in red . But these are the costliest , most intensively engineered foods in history , built to tap a gigantic new market that seemed to open overnight . In 1976 only 5 perErik Larson 's first novel , A Good Chance of Dying , will be published next year by Vil lard . cent of American households possessed a microwave oven , even though the machines had been around for twenty years . Then it was not unusual for consumers to spend as much as $500 for a microwave . Now one can be picked up for $47 , on sale , and 70 percent of all households have at least one . Sometime during the night , America crossed a threshold : More homes now have microwave ovens than have dishwashers . An electromagnetic El Dorado beckons . There remains this teensy problem : as far as food engineers are concerned , the microwave oven is one lousy cooking device . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , poach fish , boil water . Beyond this we enter the twilight world of microwave physics , where chickens wo n't broil , bread wo n't bake , souffles wo n't rise ; where no oven cooks quite the same as any other ; where jars explode , bottles rupture , and sand melts to glass . Andtherein growls the engine that may forever alter food . Engineers gave up trying to change the way these ovens work ; instead , they are struggling to make food behave the way it would if cooked in real ovens ? an immense technical challenge , as it happens . I leased a microwave oven so that my wife and I could sample the new foods . It was a big 700-watt number , handsome and black . We lived out wholly electromagnetic days , gnawing on the future , pondering the implications for unborn consumers everywhere . Some of these foods bear witness to the awesome might of American ingenuity . Some are yucky . To appreciate these foods ? why they look , smell , and behave the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first necessary to understand a few things about microwave history and physics . Here , then , is a short primer . Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic energy , as are X rays and television transmissions . Waves broadcast by an oven are roughly the length of a mouse , which I find appropriate , given the story of the microwave cat ? the one about the lady who dried her pet in a microwave oven , with disastrous results for cat and appliance . It was the accidental meltdown of a candy bar , however , that led to the development of the first oven . In 1945 , Percy L. Spencer , a Raytheon engineer , visited one of the company 's radar labs and happened to stand in front of a magnetron tube , a device which at that time generated microwaves only for radar . Spencer 's hands got warm , but the chocolate bar in his pocket melted . Intrigued , he put a bag of popcorn in front of the tube and made the world 's first helping of microwave popcorn . Intrigued-a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven was introduced by Raytheon in 1955 , but the concept became practical for home use only in 1967 , when Raytheon 's Amana subsidiary introduced its countertop Radarange , the first compact unit and the darling of future game shows . Amana 's ads invited anyone with $600 in his pocket to experience " The WONDER of the Radarange . " The idea initially was to do some real cooking from scratch with these machines . Cookbooks emerged in the early 1970s , first from Litton Industries and Sears , to encourage homemakers and enhance their sense of wonder . A 1972 cookbook declared : " The modern homemaker will be ever ready to receive unannounced visitors . " But today 's microwave consumers do not want to cook . They want to throw things into the oven and gulp them down minutes later . The market has responded : In the first half of 1987 , food companies introduced 439 new microwaveable products . William Piszek , marketing-research manager of Campbell Soup Company 's Microwave Institute and a man who mixes words the way a virtuoso chef mixes spices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandwagon , you 're going to miss the boat . " Which , when it comes to engineering these foods , is easier said than done . Ask a guy on the street how microwaves cook and he will tell you that they cook from the inside out . This is a myth , and it probably originated with the first overdone baked potato , its skin moist and pale , and its center charred black . Microwaves are energy , not heat ; they make food molecules vibrate , causing them to gain and lose kinetic energy . The waves penetrate foods to depths up to two inches , and come from all directions , cooking wherever they strike . When a food has the right size and geometry , as potatoes do , the waves converge at the center and concentrate their power . This energy is intense , and can not be dampened . A microwave oven set at half power delivers full power , but for half the time . Such raw energy alters the more leisurely physics of conventional cooking but leaves room for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's microwave and turn it on . The energy will generate a violent surge of vapor pressure inside the egg and the egg will explode , splatter , . ing yellow goo and pulverized shell over every inch of the oven cavity . Yet , for all this energy , microwaves can not brown or crisp the surface of foods . Both the cool air of the oven and the evaporation of moisture from the food keep the surfaces from drying and reaching the requisite temperatures . Foods , moreover , absorb microwave energy at wildly different rates . Microwaves will pass through ice leaving it nearly unmolested but will quickly incite water to boil . Hot Scoop ? frozen ice cream in a pool of liquid topping ? uses this phenomenon to its advantage . But the same phenomenon can lead to runaway heating ? as frozen food thaws , the part that thaws first scavenges most of the microwave energy . This allows us to experience the wonder of a TV dinner that is frozen and charred at the same time . Robert Schiffmann , perhaps the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory , a Manhattan brownstone a block west of Central Park . Once a professional ballet dancer , Schiffmann got into the food business after answering an ad seeking a physical chemist " with a sense of humor . " He spent the next decade studying the physical chemistry of doughnuts for Doughnut Corporation of America . Now he spends his time crying to make new food products burn and explode and soar from their containers , testing so he can advise engineers how to make microwave foods that work safely and perform properly . His clients include General Mills , General Foods , Kellogg , and Campbell Soup , Recently , Schiffmann studied popcorn , and considers himself something of a popcorn gadfly . More than any other product , popcorn illustrates both the promise of microwave foods and the exasperation of microwave cooking . On the positive side , microwave popcorn rejuvenated a dead market . There are now some seventy-five microwave popcorn products competing for shelf space , and they account for nearly half the sales of all microwave foods . Consumers pay dearly for the stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pop Secret for $1.99 . Each box contains 10.5 ounces of unpopped kernels . For four cents less , you can buy four pounds of ordinary Giant popcorn and get a sack big enough to sandbag your local levee . But microwave popcorn is a cantankerous product . It works well in some ovens , fails in others ; in all cases , it requires close timing and a measure of forbearance not found in the typical consumer . Schiffmann tested four leading products in three ovens , rated at 400 , 600 , and 700 watts ( there is no such thing as a standard microwave oven ) . In the first tests , he followed the packaging instructions to the letter . All the popcorns did well in the 600-watt oven , but showed extensive scorching in the higher and lower-power models . Next he conducted what he calls abuse-testing , on the assumption that consumers are likely to overcook their popcorn in order to reduce the number of unpopped kernels . But the intensity of microwave energy leaves little margin for error . " With every product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optimal time , you charred the product , " Schiffmann told me as we chewed some Amazing Glaze , a microwave popcorn he helped develop that soaks itself in a pool of melted caramel . " I 'm talking black char , melting packages , that kind of thing . " How , then , do you write heating directions for consumers who are notoriously unwilling to read them , let alone follow them , and whose ovens are all different ? The popcorn makers give instructions requiring unprecedented precision . Consider Pop Secret : " Set timer for 5 minutes and LISTEN CAREFULLY . STOP microwave when popping slows to 2 TO 3 SECONDS BETWEEN POPS . Note your popping time , and for next bag , set timer accordingly . Carefully open bag ? contents are extremely hot ! IMPORTANT : Do not leave microwave unattended while popping popcorn . Never microwave bag of popcorn more than 5 minutes 30 seconds . " The package has more red print , more underlining , more capital letters than a can of Drano . Precision alone , however , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kernels turn up at the bottoms of bags of microwave popcorn . This is a wavelength dilemma . As the popcorn pops , the number of unpopped kernels shrinks ; their mass becomes too small for the microwaves to heat , but stays large enough to annoy consumers and maybe split a few fillings . Schiffmann 's analogy : " If I had a flea in my microwave oven , he could live in there for his whole - life with the energy on ? he 's so small by comparison to the wavelength that basically he becomes invisible . But if I had a box of fleas in there , I 'd roast II ern . Which brings us to " LOw-observables technology . " What the popcorn people needed was a way to intensify the heat in their bags and force those leftover kernels to burst . Deposition Technology Inc. a San Diego company once deeply involved in Stealth research ? the Pentagon 's program to develop a bomber undetectable by radar ? came up with an answer . It had developed ways of depositing microwave-absorbent alloys into super-thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags ? Hunt-Wesson , the folks who make Orville Redenbacher 's popcorn , was first to ask DTI about it , but Pillsbury was first to actually use the technology , says Robert Petcavich , DTI 's vice president for new product development . Pillsbury embeds a stainless-steel film , called a " susceptor , " into its bag . The bag goes in the oven , film side down . When exposed to microwaves , the steel acts like a built-in hot plate . The unpopped kernels fall on the film and get an extra blast of conventional heat . Now you see susceptors everywhere . Ore-Ida Microwave Crinkle Cuts come with their own susceptorcoated cardboard pan , the Qwik Crisp tray . Belgian Chef waffles come with four-sided , film-lined cardboard boxes ? in effect , pop-up ovens . Food engineers are trying other tactics , too . Meat companies now market pre-cooked , pre-seared meats , microwaveable in minutes . Companies are rolling out microwaveable entrees that can sit on an ordinary store shelf at room temperature for years , thereby sidestepping the difficulty of cooking frozen foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two minutes or less , which saves the consumer four precious minutes that would otherwise be lost preparing a poky old Le Menu Chicken Parmigiana . What will consumers come to accept ? What kinds of foods will their kids come to know and love ? Studies show that consumers are very forgiving when it comes to microwave foods . They readily swap quality for speed . Given all the things microwave ovens can not do , it seems likely that foods will change color and texture . In some dark corners of this country , people now make grilled-cheese sandwiches in their microwaves . Will pale and moist grilled-cheese sandwiches be the grilled cheeses of choice a decade down the line ? What intangibles will the elec tromagnetic family of the future miss ? The best dinners are like good novels : the slow unfolding of the plot ( dicing , chopping , or in the greatest epics , the twenty-four-hour marinade , the seventy-two-hour sauerbraten ! ) ; the growing conflict ( how much salt ? is the roux black or just burned ? ) ; and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cos-sack 's charge , spoon and fork flailing , to mix the pesto and pasta before the pasta cools ) . Microwave dinners are jacket blurbs . You ca n't beat a microwave oven for speed . But you ca n't beat a conventional oven for suspense ? the sweet torture of baking and roasting , the aromas that drift through the house long before the dinner hour . What prompted these thoughts was my first encounter with a microwave cake . I made one the other night , Pillsbury 's yellow variety . You prepare the mix , then pour it into a pan provided with the boi . The pan is plastic ? no metal in microwaves ? and round , to keep microwave energy from concentrating in any corners . Measured from the inside , the pan is 2.75 inches high ? just right for the wavelengths broadcast by most ovens . The cake took seven minutes , a fifth of the time needed for an ordinary Pillsbury mix , and was fun to watch : It billowed like a settling sheet . But it did not smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had the feel of sweaty human flesh . It was small and pale yellow , not a bit brown . If you saw it on the kitchen counter , you would try to wipe the sink with it . I tried to get the folks at Pillsbury to talk to me about this cake . A company spokesman politely declined . " It 's too proprietary , " he said . He did say the cakes were a success , however , and that this has prompted Pillsbury to introduce microwave brownies ; that Pillsbury expects its sales of microwave-only foods to top $225 million in fiscal 1988 , compared with $172 million in 1987 . And as he hung up the phone ? I may be imagining this ? I swear I heard him cry out : You clean the oven , pal . You 'll find the Brillo under the sink . ? " How to tell you how much YS means to me ?
