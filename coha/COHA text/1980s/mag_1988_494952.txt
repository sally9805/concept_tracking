During his years as a surety lawyer for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company , Wallace Stevens would occasionally scribble down a word on a bit of paper , and ask a subordinate to go to the state library and record the definitions given in one of the heavy dictionaries that were a source of his poetic inspiration . He might have done it himself . But it is symbolically apt that he would give a single brick of poetry to a man in business dress who would carry it across the clattering city and then bring it back sanctioned for use . Of all Stevens 's little habits at the Hartford , I find this one the most evocative , because it suggests the rich confusion of his quietly complicated existence . Where do you look for Stevens ? The portrait of the artist as mature business executive has always fuddled those who have pondered this life , and a growing response to the fuddlement has been to say that too much has been made of the split between the poet and the insurance lawyer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little has been made of it . Stevens himself was acutely sensitive to the discontinuities of his life . He refused todeception of " living on the earth " with a little help from food stamps . He suggests rather that civilization depends as much on the vitality of the interior landscape as it does on the health of the earth . I read Ambasz 's complex of earth , metal , stone , and glass as an attempt to join these two landscapes , as an act of communion between the material and the ideal , between the conceptual world in which architects visualize aspirations and the physical world in which , with luck and effort , their values attain form . For Ambasz , as for Emerson , architecture is transparently a " mixed art , whose end is sometimes beauty and sometimes use . " And one of its uses , as 1 think Ambasz 's building beautifully demonstrates , is to stir us to reconsider the mixture 's proper proportions . poeticize his business world , and he refused to make a business of his poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rub of the incongruities . Poetry and business were only two terms in a life composed of clefts and fissures . Struggling for so long with obesity , he could abruptly release himself in big-bellied satisfaction . At the office he was a man of correct and sober deportment , but if the luncheon company were right or the Christmas atmosphere convivial , he could drink his way into memorable intoxication . In the midst of his constrained Northeastern domesticity , he would leave his wife and daughter for high-spirited body-indulging trips to Florida with Arthur Powell , judge and bon vivant . The sudden movement across steep divides : this was the condition of Stevens 's life . Born in 1879 , he was raised in Reading , Pennsylvania , in a late Victorian patriarchal family that upheld the sanctity of work but also enjoyed the sweet fruits of labor . Self-reliance was one good thing ; piano-playing was another . His father stood for the first , his mother for the second ; and the young Stevens liked to cast his parents in the contending roles of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the result that it took him a long time to settle into a secure corporate position , and it took him even longer to find a steady rhythm for composing poetry . After attending Harvard during the last years of the 19th century , he worked briefly as a journalist in New York , became a lawyer , married in 1909 , and entered the insurance world that would eventually bring him to Hartford in 1916 . For a long time the poetry came erratically . He had an important imaginative breakthrough shortly before the war broke out , but he did n't publish his first book of poetry , Harmonium. until 1924 . After Harmonium there followed another five years of virtual silence . His most productive ( and accomplished phase ) began in his middle 50s and covered much of the last two decades of his life . A PERVASIVF AURA of delay , then , hangs over his life . He was late to publish his first volume of poetry ( 45 ) , late to be a parent ( 44 ) , late to become vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win recognition and to collect prizes . Being late meant that he never realized his own image of " the figure of the youth as virile poet . " It also meant that he kept largely apart from the bands of young artists , the " youth gangs " ( in Wyndham Lewis 's phrase ) that gathered in cities and beat out collective definitions of the modern sensibility . it is among the ironies of his career that after his death he should be pressed into service by critics and historians competing to define the literary history of our epoch . As Marjorie Perloff has neatly argued , Stevens and Pound have emerged as the heroes of two rival academic parties . The first , with Hugh Kenner as its most noted voice , insists on the ruptures of modernism : both a rupture with the 19th-century past and a rupture within literary forms . Pound is the central exhibit , the 20th-century revolutionary who shivered 19th-century ideals of poetic unity . The second party , best represented by Harold Bloom , holds that the so-called modernist revolution is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never surpassed the fertile anxieties that begat the 19th-century mind : the great contests between imagination and reality , poet and society , religion and art . Stevens , according to this view , is our great modern Romantic , the one who tries not to escape the Romantic mission , but heroically to complete it : " The final belief is to believe in a fiction , which you know to be a fiction , there being nothing else . The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe it willingly . " With the completion of Joan Richard-son 's biography of Stevens , a new kind of argument can begin , an argument not about difficult works but about difficult lives . Richardson 's study is not a dispassionate chronicle ; it is a labor of advocacy and persuasion . It seeks to present the life not as mere context for the work , but as a work in its own right , with its own exemplary grandeur . The book has high ambitions for Stevens 's life , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serious question . A familiar theory of biography lies behind Richardson 's study , a theory of biography as immersion , saturation , absorption . Stevens is the tea bag ; Richardson is the waiting cup , and she lets him steep until she takes on his flavor . The process is long . It takes two heavy volumes , each large enough to kill the cat , before she lets Stevens return to the grave . This is monumentalist biography . It displays a human life as ample , slow , and dignified , a steadily widening web of connections that can entangle even a smooth stylist like Richardson , Here she is describing Stevens 's plans for a trip to Florida in the mid- ' 20s : Perhaps even just a brief sojourn in Florida 's " venereal soil " would breed new revelations of the beauty tinged with evil that characterized his work , as Lucky Calhoun , Harriet Monroe 's sister ( one of those to whom he had sent Harmonium in return for her kindness in sending him objects from China where she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ( May 24 , 1924 ) . The sentence chokes on its own details , and this danger runs all through the book . Stevens is valuable ; his nostril hair is part of Stevens ; therefore his nostril hair is valuable . Under the index heading Wallace Stevens you find the following sequence : spiritual polarity of , as tea connoisseur , theater as interest of , thyroid ailment of , tragic sense of , undershirts ordered by , The endless detail reflects the worthy monumentalist desire to pile high all the ephemera of life , to achieve the special dignity of totality , but the result is that the two large blanks in the biography glare even more cruelly . The first blank is Stevens at the Hartford . It is the oddest of gaps . When one considers how much time Stevens spent at the office , how many eyes watched him through how many years , and when one recalls his aphorism " Money is a kind of poetry , " then it is impossible to understand the cool disregard of the poet at the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1983 Peter Brazeau published Parts of a World , which comprises a series of interviews withthose who actually worked alongside Stevens , who saw the unpoetic gestures that tie a life to earth . But Richardson ignores the workaday business life almost entirely , and the most likely reason is a fastidious assumption that since we are interested in Stevens as a poet , the biographer should follow the trail of the poetic sensibility , not the coarse movements of the business mind . But in a passage quoted by Richardson , Stevens himself offers the strongest argument against such a narrowing of attention : I am sure that most people here in Hartford know nothing about the poetry and I am equally sure that I do n't want them to know because once they know they do n't seem to get over it . I mean that once they know they never think of you as anything but a poet and , after all , one is inevitably much more complicated than that . Are we most ourselves when we dream alone or when we toil with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The second great blank in the biography is the blank of Stevens 's marriage . If nothing were known , the issue would simply drop from consideration . But though only a few chosen guests entered the Stevens house in all those years , intermittent flashes of light came out of the shadows . The obese poet/executive secluded in his room with his slippers and his pen , the friendless wife given to fits of rage , the willful daughter in her red convertible : these are flickering images of a contemporary American gothic , whose deepest stresses it is impossible to gauge . Richardson , who can not simply drop the subject , resorts to the apparatus of supposition and hypothesis . " It is quite likely , " we are told , " that Stevens appreciated the turns of Elsie 's mind . " He " must also have been intrigued by her madness . " With images of George Burns and Gracie Allen in his head , he " must have chuckled to himself quite often . " But must he have ? This is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress up an absence , to fill in a blank with the illusion of content ( " Perhaps she ... providled him with phrases or odd perceptions that he turned into some of his curious titles or conceits " ) , is a craving for coherence , for a tidy resemblance between the dark places and the light places of a life , for a morally acceptable understanding of a worrying piece of experience . The same impulse that mutes the business world rationalizes the world of home . IF THERE IS a dominant motive urging . i. its way through the book 's many pages , it is the desire to retrieve Stevens for the forces of moral enlightenment and political progressivism . Richardson 's target is the prevailing view of the poet as conservative businessman and political rightist . She takes his notorious remark " I am pro-Mussolini , personally , " and his still more notorious gloss " The Italians have as much right to take Ethiopia from the coons as the coons had to take it from the boa constrictors , " and suggests that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane Latimer , " to see what kind of reader Latimer would be . " The evidence is Stevens 's " clarification " in his next letter : While it is true that I have spoken sympathetically of Mussolini , all of my sympathies are the other way : with the coons and the boa constrictors , However , ought 1 , as a matter of reason , to have sympathized with the Indians as against the Colonists in this country ? A man would have to be very thick-skinned not to be conscious of the pathos of Ethiopia or China : or one of these days , if we are not careful , of this country . But that Mussolini is right , practically , has certainly a great deal to be said for it . Stevens was no fascist , but no more was he the socialist-leaning peace-lover that Richardson paints . He was politically untutored , uncommitted , largely uninterested . During the ' 30s , when no one could avoid heavy political weather , he made a series of fitful gestures to find an identity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " up-to-date capitalism , " resigned himself to being called a rightist , used grotesque racial epithets , and never troubled about the unity of his views . The idea that Stevens had a " commitment to the left and to peace " is a wish posing as a fact . Stevens 's silence in the face of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and his defense of reformist capitalism trouble his biographer , who hastens to argue that given " all the other voicings of his sympathy with the left and with socialism , " it is impossible to assign him a " conservative posture . " If Stevens ignores the sufferings of the world to contemplate the beautifully bound volume of his Esfhetique du Mal , it is not a sign of moral indifference ; it is better seen as " one of those occasions when he was so moved by the horror of what he observed that he once more turned his attention to something that could give solace ... " All this is whitewash , pure whitewash , sloppily , indecently applied . S TEVENS WAS a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man ? He had no political " posture " ; he had political spasms , sometimes on the left side of his body , sometimes on the right . He was a mixed , imperfect , clayey human being . Richardson reports that when his older brother , Garrett jr. , became seriously ill , Stevens and his younger brother gave monthly support up to the time of Garrett 's demise , " well over a year later . " Stevens then continued to send money , " usually in the form of holiday gifts , " to his widowed sister-in-law , remaining " consistently generous and gracious , " despite the emotional ambiguities of his relationship with his brother . And from this episode of incontestable ( though not unprecedented ) human kindness , Richardson passes to the conclusion that " in this situation , as in all others , Stevens acted in the model fashion that we would want everyone to act , even though we realized that not even one other might follow . " Passages like these are as uncanny as they are unconvincing . Conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded some highly distressing incidents that jeopardize the moral panegyric : Stevens 's rather brutal public suppressions of his wife , for example , or his cold insistence that his daughter , Holly , attend Vassar College , though she bitterly opposed the plan and soon frustrated it by dropping out . Stevens was capable of kindness and ruthlessness , of magnanimity and cruelty , of generosity and egotism . He was no poet/saint ; he was one of us . Except when he was writing : then he was one of them , the dancing geniuses . It is the urge to place artistic genius in the service of common life that lies behind a broad phenomenon to which this biography is a recent addition . The appetite for the lives of the artists , especially the lives of the moderns , is great and apparently growing . Why ? A beginning of an answer is that the integrity of the work so moves us that we can not help hoping that it corresponds to an integrity in the life . If human beings could be as good as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an image of the good life we would have . Literary critics talk of a biographical fallacy , of the crude assumption that when we have identified its source in life , we have solved the puzzle of a work . Butthere is an opposite , unnamed error , that we might call the oeuvre fallacy : the assumption that perfection in the art implies perfection in the life . Stevens is especially seductive in this regard , first because his poetry was grand , and second because the life outside the poetry was not grand at all . Few of us , I suppose , can muster a passable fantasy of what it would have been to lead the life of Picasso , or Pound , or Proust . But so much of Stevens 's life is so near to us that we scarcely need the imagination . He struggles with his marriage , worries about his daughter , complains about taxes , goes to work , listens to music in the evening . If such a life can be seen as possessing the dignity of Stevens 's poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B UT IT CAN NOT , and we are not . Stevens kept his genius for his art ; the leading of his life is something that he did without any special grace . The jealous guarding of intimacy , the uneasiness with so many fellow workers , the rudeness ( real and imagined ) , the coldness toward those closest to him ? all this gives sharp point to his aphorism " Life is an affair of people not of places . But for me life is an affair of places and that is the trouble . " He evidently enjoyed his grandson ; with his wife he shared a taste for gardening . But his greatest pleasures were characteristically private . " I am not a good talker , " he confessed , " and do n't particularly enjoy exchanging ideas with people in talk . " And elsewhere : " Personally , I nourish myself on books , nature , this and that , music ? so rarely on the good friend . ships of men and women ... " I see no reason to reverse Richardson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral exemplar . The point is rather to accept the life outside the poetry as psychologically unresolved , morally unsettled , politically indeterminate . Stevens 's daily life did not catch the radiance of his poetry . Indeed , what is disturbing , but also perhaps illuminating , is the extent to which the brightness of the art seems to have accompanied , and even required , faintness in the rest of the life . Consider two analogies between the work and the life . Among the most familiar aspects of Stevens 's poetry is its sudden turn toward nonsense . In the context of taut argument or high rhetoric , there is a quick descent into " the poet 's gibberish , " as for example at the beginning of " Mozart 1935 " : Poet , be seated at the piano . Play the present , its hoo-hoo-hoo , Its shoo-shoo-shoo , its ric-a-nic , Its envious cachinnation . We may associate these moments of nonsense with those eruptions that occur in the outer life : the bouts of drinking , the bursts of cutting rudeness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman/husband breaks ; it lets go , bubbles over , shrieks for a minute . But there remains a telling difference . In the life he shared with human beings , Stevens never found a happy continuity between Florida and Connecticut , drunkenness and sobriety , poetry and law , anger and mildness . As he puts it to his daughter in explaining his quarrels with Elsie , " The blowups that we have are blowups of the nerves ? when they are over , they are over . " Exactly . But inside the poetry , at those moments of release when the sense snaps and the language gets loopy , there is no shattering of continuity . Sense and nonsense keep commerce between them . Intoxication finds a place inside sobriety , or , more radically , sobriety curls up inside intoxication . The poetry is able to contain the explosions that the life leaves unassimilated and unresolved . D URING THE Second World War , Stevens developed a strong , even obsessive , interest in his family history , hiring several genealogists to track down his ancestral line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side showed in Stevens 's desire to qualify as a member of the highly exclusive Holland Society . In the summer of 1944 ( note the date ) , he wrote to Lila James Rooney , his chief genealogist , asking her to get him a membership : Recently , I joined the St. Nicholas Society on the basis of your material , but it is the Holland Society that I particularly want , because when I start to talk about being descended from the first white child in New Netherland , people who would n't believe it otherwise would believe it if I could say that I was a member of the Holland Society . Wanting to talk with authority when he has something extreme to say ? is n't this what drove Stevens to become , among other things , a poet of the dictionary ? Here is the second analogy . The impulse to retrieve forgotten words ( such as some that R. P. Blackmur collected : fubbed , girandoles , pipping , cantilene , fiscs ) finds its reflection in the impulse to retrieve forgotten ancestors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both attempts to establish a large context in which to place yourself ( or your words ) , so that you ( or they ) no longer stand alone . But again a difference interrupts the analogy . The genealogical search is for a private victory , while the quest through the dictionary is not for a personal past , but for a common linguistic ancestry ( " He tries by a peculiar speech to speak / The peculiar potency of the general " ) . When Stevens succeeds as a poet , he succeeds not as a proud white child in a long line of such but ( his words are irresistible ) as " part of nature " and " part of us . " How to explode in a moment of freedom ? How to find a larger universe to problems for both the poet and the citizen of Hartford . The first finds some inspired solutions , the second stumbles along like any other uncertain mortal . It is a hard thought , but one worth facing , that what Stevens gave to his poetry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ? he borrowed from his life , that his art could only make its red blaze by letting a human being turn pale .
