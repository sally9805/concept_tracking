TOKYO  --  The Japanese stock market , much to the amazement of foreign investors , keeps going up . Even the death Saturday of Emperor Hirohito has touched off a rally this week , providing an object lesson in how deep bullish sentiment runs here . To start with , there ' s pent-up demand from Japanese investors , who had held off buying while the 87-year-old monarch was gravely ill . Buying enthusiasm reflects a host of other reasons , too , led by Japan ' s booming economy . Inflation and interest rates are low . Corporate profits are strong . And tax changes and large-scale bond redemptions are sending a flood of new money cascading through the Tokyo stock market . Only U.S. investors and other foreigners seem worried that stock prices may be too high in Tokyo , the world ' s largest market in terms of the total value of stocks traded . But locals are unimpressed by their pessimism . " We think foreigners are crazy ever to sell in Japan , " says Yasumasa Mitani , president of Tokyo Associated Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' s concerned , the imperial succession merely underlined Japan ' s bright future , and he was a buyer . " The economy is fantastic and everything is strong , " he says . On Tuesday , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks soared 328. 12 points , or 1. 1% , to 31006. 51 , a second consecutive record . The index rocketed 468. 85 points Monday . Trading volume Tuesday was a heavy 1. 5 billion shares , up from Monday ' s healthy 1. 1 billion . In Tokyo Wednesday , the Nikkei index surged another 114. 40 points to end the morning session at 31120. 91 , a new high . Since Emperor Hirohito fell ill last September , many Japanese had shied away from stocks out of concern that his death might trigger a sell-off . Large securities houses assumed a stance of self-restraint when the market opened Monday morning . But the tide of small investors looking to buy was so strong that the institutions soon found themselves joining in just to keep pace . Stock-index arbitrage , in which securities firms capitalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fueled the gains . Tokyo ' s latest surge follows a long series of advances . Since Oct. 19 , the Tokyo market has climbed 14. 2% , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen just 1. 8% in the same period . For all of 1988 , Tokyo gained 39. 9% , while the Dow Jones industrials rose 11. 8% . Japan ' s healthy economy  --  which grew at a blistering 9. 3% annual rate in the quarter ended last Sept. 30  --  is one reason the bulls are buying . Even though longer-term growth isn ' t as rapid , analysts say the economy seems well-balanced . Masataka Ogura , manager of investment research for the analysis division of New Japan Securities Co. , says higher domestic consumption has eased Japan ' s dependence on foreign trade , making the country less vulnerable to external economic shocks . In the fiscal year ended March 1986 , the country ' s trade surplus accounted for 4. 2% of gross national product , the total output of goods and services . In the year ended last March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6% . " It shows that the Japanese economy has succeeded in the transition from export-oriented to domestic demand-oriented economy , " Mr. Ogura says . Yet growth has remained high , without igniting consumer prices . In the fiscal year ending in March , Bank of Tokyo predicts , Japanese consumer prices will have risen only 0. 9% , after increasing only 0. 5% the previous year . There is the risk that higher oil prices could set off inflation  --  Japan imports oil for nearly all of its energy needs  --  but huge oil stockpiles will forestall the effect of any price increases . The absence of inflationary pressure has allowed monetary authorities to keep interest rates low , making it possible for investors to borrow cheaply and invest for higher returns in the stock market . At the moment , Japan ' s discount rate , the official rate at which the Bank of Japan lends to banks , stands at 2. 5% , while rates on overnight loans between banks closed Tuesday at about 3. 8% . In the U.S. , the Federal Reserve Board ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds rate on overnight bank loans is about 9. 125% . One side effect of low interest rates is to unstop a large pool of money now locked into 10-year , publicly issued Japanese government bonds and postal savings accounts . Interest rates were high 10 years ago , so many investors socked away funds then in long-term instruments . Now , those investments are coming due . At least eight trillion yen ( $63. 5 billion ) of 10-year bonds will mature in each of the coming two years , and the coupons on those bonds range from 6. 15% to 8. 5% . Bonds today offer coupons of less than 5% , so Japanese investors may look for higher-yielding investments , including stocks , for their money . " It ' s no surprise , " observes Kermit L. Schoenholtz , an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. ' s Tokyo office . " And it ' s impossible to attribute a single day ' s activities to factors such as these . " Still , it lends support to the old " weight of money " saw that observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For many Japanese investors , there ' s no way out , " says Tomoyuki Kubo , a senior manager in pension fund investment for Sumitomo Trust &; Banking Co . " Tokyo is where they have to put their money . " Overseas investments carry the risk of foreign exchange losses , government bonds are paying less , and the country ' s real estate market is weak right now . Says Mr. Kubo : " Japan is the safest place for Japanese money . " Japanese investors keep finding other reasons to buy , including an unusual tax incentive that the Tokyo government recently created . Starting in April , securities houses will withhold a 1% capital gains tax from all stock transactions . Until then , though , investors can continue to play by last year ' s rules , which allow them to trade as much as 120 , 000 shares or make 30 transactions before they are liable to pay standard income tax on all capital gains . So investors are scurrying for trading profits before the new fiscal year and new tax system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Investors Blanch At the Lofty Prices "  --  WSJ Jan. 11 , 1988 ) Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
