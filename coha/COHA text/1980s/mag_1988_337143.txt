" Murderers ! Murderers ! " yelled an enraged black spectator at the trial in New York City as the jury foreman announced the verdict . Two white teenagers , charged with chasing a black man out of their Howard Beach neighborhood to his death on a freeway , had been acquitted of murder and convicted , along with a third youth , on the lesser charge of manslaughter . A fourth had been found innocent of all charges . Though the gray decision satisfied the victim 's mother , it could not dispel all the passions that have arisen among both blacks and whites since the tragedy one year ago made Howard Beach a synonym for racial tension . <P> The case involved the death of Michael Griffith , who had the misfortune to wander with two friends into the mostly white community after their automobile broke down . Shouting racial epithets and waving a baseball bat and tree limbs , about a dozen youths confronted the black men . One of the blacks pulled a knife . Griffith , 23 , was chased onto a highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing car . The youths then severely beat one of Griffith 's companions . Defense attorneys described the crime as a simple " fight , " and pointed out that two of the victims had criminal records . <P> The three-month trial came to be considered a litmus test of racial justice in New York . Since the June acquittal of Bernhard Goetz on all but a minor count for his subway attack on four black youths , many of New York 's black leaders have been claiming that the city is not a place where blacks can expect equal justice . The atmosphere inside the Howard Beach courtroom mirrored the racial polarization that they say is afflicting the city . A largely black audience packed one side of the courtroom , with Jean Griffith , the victim 's mother , at the center . On the other side , amid a white crowd , were the families and friends of the defendants . <P> Aside from the response of outspoken spectators , reaction to last week 's verdict was restrained , almost relieved , because the black community had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquitted of all major charges . As it turned out , however , three youths face up to 15 years in prison for manslaughter : Jon Lester , 18 , Scott Kern , 18 , and Jason Ladone , 17 . Many of those involved in the trial felt that at least a measure of justice had been meted out . Said Jean Griffith : " God , in the end , did what was right . "
