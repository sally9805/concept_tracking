Neat little packets of marijuana , coke and even heroin nestling against the vitamins at the neighborhood drugstore ? And selling at a low Government-set price with a guarantee of purity ? It sounds like a black comedy or perhaps a gaudy hallucination . In fact , it is the extreme version of a new policy course being advocated in dead seriousness by a growing number of those frustrated by the futility of the drug war . The 74 years of federal prohibition that have passed since the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 have been a costly and abject failure , they say , and the effort is doomed . It has mainly served to create huge profits for drug dealers , overcrowded jails , a distorted foreign policy and urban areas terrorized by bloodthirsty gangs . So why not end all these problems in a way that would save money , perhaps even raise it , and free more resources to treat addiction and abuse ? Why not just make drugs legal ? <P> Those who have begun to take this question seriously do not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . The swelling chorus includes conservative scholars , police officers and city officials who would love to see a dope-free nation . But they feel that the best way to curtail drugs is to treat them as a public health problem rather than a criminal one . In the process , the Government could take the drug market out of the hands of the gangs that have turned large sections of major cities into shooting galleries , in more ways than one . <P> , Such talk horrifies many critics equally bedeviled by the drug dilemma . To them legalization is an immoral and dangerous policy that would vastly increase the number of addicts and turn the U.S. into a " society of zombies , " in the words of New York Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato . If drugs were freely available , what is now a nagging but contained problem could end up tearing apart the nation 's social fabric . <P> Whether it is inspired or insane , drug legalization has become the idea of the moment . That in itself shows the intensity of the national frenzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about drugs and related crime . Polls show drugs emerging as the hottest issue in the presidential election . In a New York Times-CBS News survey last week , 16% of those questioned called drugs the nation 's No. 1 problem . It has direct political consequences : respondents thought Democrats would do a better job than the Administration in fighting drugs . They favored Michael Dukakis over George Bush , reinforcing a trend that first appeared in a TIME poll five weeks ago . <P> Campaigning in New Jersey , Dukakis sought to capitalize on this advantage : he walked with a hand-held microphone among 500 students at the Pine Brook Junior High School in Manalapan to preach an antidrug sermon . At a later press conference , he once again criticized the Reagan Administration for cutting funds for antidrug programs .
