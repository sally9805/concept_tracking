When it comes to flinging a football and blowing off steam , nobody puts it together better than Jim McMahon . So the Chicago Bears quarterback was a natural to talk about stress for Connections , a biweekly series of billboard topics posted in 1,500 high schools around the country . Despite the munching pose he struck for one poster , McMahon rarely takes it out on the ball . His tips for coping with strain : " I never really worry about things before they happen . I let things happen and I deal with them then . . . It 's important to keep your sense of humor . You have to see the light side . . . If something is pressuring me , I have to get rid of it . I have to scream or yell or punch a bag . " Fine , but maybe Connections should include a disclaimer , just to be safe . Something like " Warning : McMahon is a professional cutup . Do not attempt to follow all these instructions in your own home . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
