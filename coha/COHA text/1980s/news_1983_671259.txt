King Jr. in 1963 is on Page 28. // // // WASHINGTON , Aug. 27 - In numbers roughly equal to those of the 1963 march on Washington that set the civil rights movement alight , demonstrators gathered here today to celebrate that march and to seek a new coalition for social and political change. // Many of the demonstrators said they had come to rekindle the spirit of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , whose " I Have a Dream " speech galvanized the crowd two decades ago , but there were others with a far broader agenda. // " Twenty years ago we came as individuals , " said Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta , who was then an aide to Dr. King . " We came back as organizations . There were many women here then , but no women ' s organizations ; many Hispanics , many members of organized labor , many handicapped , but none nearly so organized as they are now. " // // // Anti-Reagan Coalition Urged // A succession of speakers urged the creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s election . Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy , who speaks for the District of Columbia in Congress , led a chant : " We ' re fired up ! We won ' t take it anymore ! Send them back to Hollywood ! " // Sweltering , humid weather in the 90 ' s greeted the marchers as they occupied the grand shaded expanses along the boulevards and spread through the parklands between the Washington Monument and the Potomac. // The National Park Service police estimated the crowd at 200 , 000 , about the same as that of the original march . Most of the marchers were black , but there were also large numbers of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white people. // <> <> Ovation for Mrs. King // There were speeches on such topics as a nuclear freeze , United States involvement in El Salvador and the proposed Federal equal rights amendment , but most demonstrators seemed unfamiliar with the organizers ' far- reaching agenda - they had come to celebrate the spirit of Dr. King. // In one of today ' s first speeches , Coretta Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar from those who arrived early when she declared , " We still have a dream. " // " We are all here to reaffirm our commitment to peace , justice , brotherhood and equality , " she said . " We gather today in nonviolent solidarity. " // One of the marchers , Linda S. Rayford , 33 years old , who works in a Senate office on Capitol Hill , said : " Everything seems to be going downhill for blacks . This will show the world we are not going to take it sitting down . The march 20 years ago should have made this one unnecessary. " // President Reagan issued a statement from California calling the 1963 march " a moving moment in American history . " He added : " Although the emphasis of the 1963 march on Washington was on the rights of black Americans , the values that were appealed to are shared by us all. " // Mr. Reagan did not mention civil rights or the march in his regular Saturday radio broadcast , which was mainly on Middle East policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. King said that the Administration was " out of touch with all but an elite group of Americans , " and that Mr. Reagan was merely " flirting with blacks , and flirting with the idea of changing his mind and endorsing a Federal holiday to honor my husband . " <> <> Singing ' We Shall Overcome ' // Crowds began to gather early this morning for the rally , which continued well into the evening , finally ending shortly before 7 P.M. // It had begun 11 hours earlier , when a small crowd , some singing " We Shall Overcome , " the anthem of the civil rights movement , began to move toward a grassy clearing behind the Washington Monument , the starting point for the march. // By 9 A.M. , on a platform surrounded by a wall of loudspeakers and television equipment , entertainers had begun their performances , and the first speakers of the day made their addresses . Stage and screen personalities meandered through the crowd , joined by four candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination - former Vice President Walter F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart of Colorado and former Gov . Reubin Askew of Florida . <> <> Events Proceeded Briskly // At 9 : 40 A.M. , amid scattered applause and a thick cloud of dust , about two dozen organizers , arms linked , pushed through the milling crowd. // Unlike the sometimes casual timing of the 1963 march , today ' s events proceeded briskly . Just before 11 A.M. , the main speakers began arriving at the Lincoln Memorial by helicopter. // By 12 : 30 the main thrust of the throng had begun to swing slowly from east to west , from the vicinity of the Capitol toward the Lincoln Memorial . But thousands of others streamed on foot from the Virginia side of the Memorial Bridge , walking the mile and a half from the charter bus parking lot outside the Pentagon. // Prompted by a combination of steamy heat and poor acoustics , thousands drifted away from the Mall as the afternoon wore on . As a result , the Park Service said that the total turnout was on the order of 250 , 000 , although no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The police said 100 people were treated for heat-related illness . Only four arrests were reported , all for misdemeanors . <> <> ' Run Jesse Run ' // As the Rev. Jesse Jackson of Operation PUSH was introduced and approached the podium , spontaneous shouts of " Run Jesse run , run Jesse run , " came forth from those on the podium and in the crowd , and some voiced their disappointment that he did not use this forum to announce that he would seek the Democratic Presidential nomination. // Nevertheless , Mr. Jackson drew one of the more enthusiastic responses among the 50 or so afternoon speakers . He said that in the past 20 years , blacks and other minorities achieved " our freedom , our civil rights , " but that " 20 years later , we still do not have equality. // " We have moved in , " he said . " Now , we must move up. " // But no speaker captured the audience the way Martin Luther King did that afternoon 20 years ago . The most emotional part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in praise of her slain husband. // " Today is Martin ' s day , " she declared , but she added , " It is a day of hope for you and your children . " <> <> ' We Are Free at Last ' // " We are united by adversity , " she said , but " we are united by love . " And , she said , " We are united by Martin Luther King Jr . " Mrs. King tried to hold back the tears that began to gather in her eyes as she proclaimed , " Martin , this is your day ! " // At that , a recording of Mr. King ' s " I Have a Dream " speech was played over the loudspeakers and her children joined her at the speaker ' s platform , which was mounted not far from the statue of Lincoln. // Mrs. King held hands with her children and wept as her husband ' s words were heard . Finally , she repeated the last portion of her husband ' s speech : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty , we are free at last. " // At that , led by a solitary saxophone player , the people in the crowd sang " We Shall Overcome , " many of them joining hands , and then went home. // //
