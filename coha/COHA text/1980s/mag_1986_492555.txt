// Tir hen Dede Elmer met her fu- r ture husband at a collegiate get-acquainted mixer , no fireworks ignited  --  only her hair . Playing hostess and arranging goodies , she was busying herself at the refreshment table at the time . Trying to avoid the enthusiastic advances of an admirer shorter than she ( " Pm not a little person , " she acknowledges ) , she bent too close to the candles . That was when she noticed the burning smell . " Before I even realized my hair was on fire , a tall man with bushy eyebrows was putting it out , " she recalls more than 35 years later . " I think that 's probably what attracted me to him . From that point on , I knew my life would never be dull . " She was right . As Mrs. Pat Robertson , her world has come full circle  --  the relationship that began on an Ivy League campus in Connecticut continues on a lush campus the Robertsons helped to create in Virginia . But if CBN University is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culmination of their travels . Robertson supporters across the country are urging one more stop for the twosome  --  Washington , D.C. Dede ( she pronounces it DeeDee ) is aware of the promote-Pat-forpresident push ; in a tentative way , she shares the enthusiasm . " I 'd like to be able to tune it out , " she says frankly , " but I feel our nation needs the kind of leadership my husband has to offer . He has a tremendous knowledge of the world situation  --  in other words , foreign policy . He has a good knowledge of economics . He knows about taxation : He is a tax lawyer , even though he does n't practice law . I think his greatest strength is his knowledge of people and how they work and how they react . And his compassion for people . " An endorsement ? Of sorts . That a political bid  --  even a precampaign test of the waters  --  would take Pat on the road even more than his duties as president of the Christian Broadcasting Network evokes only her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's used to it , after all . " This is something I 've learned to live with , and as a result , I have a lot of inner resources , " she says . " I 've taught myself to knit , sew , embroider , and upholster furniture . " Then there 's my writing . . At takes up more time than I thought it would , " she adds . Her books inprint include My God Will Supply ( Chosen Books ) and The New You ( Thomas Nelson Publishers ) , which documents her personal day-to-day fitness plan . In addition , she contributes a monthly column to Christian Life magazine , serves as the design decorator for the sprawling CBN complex , and actively fulfills her role as the United States ' delegate to the inter-American Commission of Women , an appointment she accepted five years ago from the U.S. Secretary of State . The trappings of all her activities pleasantly clutter her third-floor office in the administration center of CBN University ; the furnishings reflect her passion for color and her knack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swatches of bright yellow and blue chintz are fanned over her desk , crewel pictures and collectors ' plates dot the walls , and yellow-print chairs serve as catchalls , Dede could use a secretary for all the correspondence her interests generate , but always a do-it-yourselfer , she sees no need to change . " My main duty here is that I 'm design director , and everything  --  every piece of furniture , every color paint  --  has to be approved by me , " she explains . " It began as a hobby , but then started studying it seriously . I found that antiques and period reproductions cost less than modern furniture and give you a warmer feeling . We were able to pick up a lot of pieces in England before we moved here , and we 'll probably make another trip before we build the new conference center . " The decor she chooses is a reflection of herself : elegant yet comfortable , imposing but continued on page 65 graceful , classic and warm . Her surroundings have n't always been as well appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only recently has involved creating professional settings for a world-wide ministry . " My degree from Ohio State is in social administration , which usually leads to a career in social work . I was mainly interested in helping juvenile delinquents , " she says . " Later , I got my master 's degree in nursing from Yale . It was something I always felt I wanted to do . " The nursing program not only enabled her to meet her future husband but instilled in her a lifelong interest in nutrition and preventive health , two subjects that served her well as the mother of four youngsters and the wife of a struggling young pastor . Her specialization , maternal and child care , did not stop her from visiting steel mills and rubber plants across the country , studying industrial health , and teaching on-campus nursing classes . She particularly enjoyed her instructional duties and later assumed a post as an assistant pro-lessor of nursing at Tidewater Community College for eight years . " If I was led to nursing for a purpose , " Dede says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , I 've gotten a great deal of satisfaction from my career , and it certainly helped me raise my family . In teaching , I probably was able to contribute a lot just from the Christian aspect . " Because of the flexibility of her nursing career , she was occasionally able to ease her family 's financial burden by working odd hours and alternating weekends . It was n't easy , and she does n't recommend it . " If mothers can just wait a little while , children do go to school  --  they do grow up . It 's those important first years before school that they really need a mother 's ' being there . ' For one thing , that 's where you start encouraging creativity . . . that 's where you start making sand castles , finger-painting , and all sorts of projects that help them to develop their unique ideas , " she says . Her own four children  --  Tim , Elizabeth , Gordon , and Ann have now left the nest for busy careers and blossoming families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive vice president of television at CBN ; Elizabeth recently resigned as the operations manager of a Dallas TV station to enjoy her new baby ; Gordon followed in Pat 's footsteps to law school and now has a practice in Norfolk ; and Ann oversees CBN 's founders ' department . Dede and Pat , proud of their children , describe themselves as " doting grandparents " of three little ones . The Robertsons readily admit that their kids passed through all the typical stages of the teen-age years . " I consider them very normal , " Dede says . " A normal child is going to experiment with about everything , and I 'm pretty sure my children have experimented with almost everything . Some of the things I do n't know anything about , and I 'm just as happy not knowing about them . What they did in some of their experiments they knew would not wash well at home . They tried it anyhow . But think every one of them has come to find the Lord 's way is best , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them choose their own directions , but she was always available for a word of advice if solicited . Having recognized that local teens had no gathering place to call their own , she provided one . " 1 had a teen-agers ' coffeehouse in our garage for about two years when Elizabeth was a sophomore in high school , " she recalls . " It was just a place where they could come , play their music , and sing their songs . They decorated it themselves and had their own Coke machine . Sometimes musicians would come in and play for them . It did n't start out to be big , but it grew . At one point , we had about a hundred teen-agers . " The coffeehouse closed when the younger Robertsons progressed to college , but most of Dede 's activities continue to focus on children . She expresses a strong sentiment that children need lots of " TLC " from a mother figure , especially during the vitalpreschool years . She 's pleased that CBN has recently launched a system of " mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The goal is to keep children in a homelike atmosphere with a dominant mother figure . " This is one of the things I 'm pushing right now , " Dede says . " We do n't have it all set up , and it 's still in the experimental stage . In fact , we do n't even have a good name for it yet . But the idea is to encourage mothers either to stay home and take care of other people 's children , or put their children in the homes of mothers who are staying home . " The program will eventually be under the direction of local churches that will offer training . Once a week the day-care moms will come together at the church for a refresher lesson to give them a sense of being part of something better and greater , while instilling a feeling of achievement and counteracting the loneliness that women get when they stay at home . We'refinding the two challenges to the concept are motivating mothers to take the training and helping them to overcome a lack of self-esteem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you 're an account executive than a day-care mother . " Dede sees herself as having a ministry to women ; she reaches out to them via her magazine column , " All in a Woman 's Day , " and by keynoting retreats , seminars , and meetings . She encourages her audiences to realize their full potential and admits to having little patience with apathetic or passive women . Get involved , she prods them . " Some women do n't know where to begin , so they do n't begin at all . An awful lot of women are very , very guilty of having ' pity parties . ' They sit back and enjoy their martyrdom . They 're not willing to get out , get started , and take chances , " she says . Her advice ? " Find something that interests you . . . whether it 's gardening , cooking , or reading , " she says . " And I do n't mean romance novels ! " MTS . Robertson speaks from ex-perience . She and Pat have a long history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . When Pat announced he was leaving a successful business career and a promising law practice for the ministry , she encouraged him . When he turned down a position at a comfortable church and opted for an inner-city ministry in New York 's Bedford-Stuyvesant area , she gulped and followed . Now , settled comfortably in an elegant Williamsburg setting she helped create , she 's faced with the possibility of more change , a new challenge , and even a political campaign . But Dede is game  --  even if it means a loss of privacy and all the scrutiny and criticism that plague prospective First Families . " Well , we 've had some ofthat , " she says . " I 'm sure there 'll be more . It 's something you have to learn to live with and not let get under your skin . " Does that mean that Dede Robertson would agree to a little grass-roots stumping of her own ? She nods and mumbles a " probably so . " Then she grins . After all , she always knew life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
