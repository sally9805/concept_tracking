The scenario was all too familiar . As U.S. Navy Captain William E. Nordeen , 51 , a military attache at the American embassy in Athens , was setting out for work in his bulletproof Ford Granada last week , the morning calm was shattered by an explosion . A bomb planted in a Toyota sedan parked near Nordeen 's home had been detonated by remote control as he drove by . The blast hurled Nordeen 's car across the street ; the captain 's decapitated body was found more than 100 ft. away in the yard of an abandoned house . <P> A band of leftist terrorists called November 17 claimed responsibility for the attack . Nordeen was the 14th victim and the third American killed by the organization since 1975 . Declared the killers : " We decided to execute one of the higher-ranking officers of American imperialism in our country . "
