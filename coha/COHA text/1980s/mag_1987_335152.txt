Of all malignancies , breast cancer is perhaps the one most feared by women , and with good reason . For one thing , it is the most common form of cancer found in women : about one in ten will eventually be stricken , and the American Cancer Society estimates that 130,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year alone . For another , it will cause approximately 41,000 deaths among females in 1987 , second only to a projected total of 44,000 for the less prevalent but deadlier lung cancer . And even when breast cancer is successfully treated , that success is often accompanied by permanent disfigurement and psychological damage . For all these reasons , women are particularly concerned about the causes as well as the treatment of breast cancer , and eager to learn anything they can about how to reduce their risk of contracting it . <P> Unfortunately , only some risk factors , such as a high-fat diet , can be controlled . Many others  --  age ( over 50 ) , for example , or a family history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past several years that there may be one more factor women can do something about : the consumption of alcoholic beverages . Two studies published in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine made that case even stronger . <P> One report , by researchers at Harvard Medical School , concluded that women who consume as few as three drinks a week have a 30% greater chance of developing breast cancer than those who seldom or never drink . In the other study , researchers at the National Cancer Institute went further , reporting a &lt; 50% higher risk for women who drink any alcohol at all , and as much as a 100% increase in risk for those who have three drinks or more weekly . <P> Lawrence Garfinkel , vice president for epidemiology and statistics at ACS , was impressed with the results . " Women ca n't do anything about most of the risk factors associated with breast cancer , " he said .

Said Peter Greenwald , director of NCI 's **29;9080;TOOLONG division : " We do n't have the information to be making a public recommendation at this point . " Garfinkel agreed , " We need a lot more data . " One problem is that these and earlier studies simply associate drinking with cancer ; they do not show a cause-and- effect relationship or offer an explanation of the mechanisms involved . <P> Even if there is such a relationship , it may be far from direct : researchers have speculated that alcohol may make it easier for carcinogens to penetrate breast tissue or may affect hormones metabolized by the liver or released from the pituitary gland . Said Robert Hiatt of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland , who reported an alcohol-breast cancer link in 1984 : " So far , this is an epidemiological finding that has been repeated , leading to concern . As yet , there is no linkup with biology . " Indeed , even NCI 's Greenwald conceded that alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
