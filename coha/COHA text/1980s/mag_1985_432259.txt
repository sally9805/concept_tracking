 | At the Michigan Cancer Foundation in Detroit , requests for information about cancer doubled almost overnight . In Colorado Springs , telephone calls to the state 's Cancer Information Service jumped from 20 to 115 calls a day . The University of Chicago Medical Center got so many requests for colorectal cancer-detection tests that a special screening clinic has been set up . Across the U.S. , as news of President Reagan 's cancer surgery spread , people besieged doctors ' offices and cancer centers for checkups and information . The surge of activity is only the start of what many medical authorities believe will be a profound impact on the country ? a change for the better in public attitudes toward cancer . " The President is a good role model for people . They say ? hey , here 's a man of 74 , he had cancer , he came through surgery with flying colors and now look what he can do , " says Dr. Robert McKenna of the University of Southern California School of Medicine and president of the American Cancer Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death warrant ; that 's not the case , " adds Dr. Arthur Holleb , vice president for medical affairs at the American Cancer Society . " With the President back in the White House , the public will be encouraged that you can live comfortably and normally with cancer . " Improved odds . Reagan 's favorable prognosis is backed by statistics showing how the outlook for cancer patients has changed in the past few decades . Nearly half of all people diagnosed as having cancer today will survive . Of the 5 million Americans who have been treated for cancer , 3 million have lived at least five years without any recurrence of the disease and are considered cured . Better diagnostic techniques , such as mammography to detect breast cancer and greater understanding of cancer 's warning signs have meant that more cases are being found at earlier , moretreatable stages . Advances in medical therapies from experimental vaccines to more-precise surgery also have improved prospects for cancer patients . Still , since cancer is really 120 differ ent diseases , there is significant variation in survival rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is detected early have a 96 percent chance of living at least five years . On the other hand , survival rates for lung cancer remain low ? less than 15 percent . Over all , the incidence of cancer is growing , mainly because of the general aging of the population . But while more people are dying of cancer ? 126,000 deaths in 1985 from lung cancer alone ? it 's also true that more are living with this disease than ever before . " I 'm as healthy as anybody who works here , " says Dallas office manager Jean Barrar , who had her colon cancer operated on in 1956 . " I do anything I want to and eat anything I want to . " Despite these advances , there is a deep-seated stigma attached to cancer . A 1984 survey by the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia found that three quarters of the 2,700 people surveyed had a fatalistic attitude toward cancer and felt that nothing could be done to prevent getting the disease . What health officials are hoping is that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public stage from Public attention on the President 's illness may help dispel some old myths about malignant diseases . the stunning news of the diagnosis to future checkups ? will force the country to re-examine its cancer myths . The most immediate impact will be seen in the treatment of colon cancer , which now is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths . " We 've had hundreds of calls , " says Dr. Stephen Hanauer , a gastroenterologist at the University of Chicago Medical Center . He points out that with the President 's operation the public has learned that colon cancer is more common than previously realized , that there are tests to detect it and that treatment does not automatically mean total removal of the colon and a colostomy to collect wastes . " That is definitely going to save some lives , " he predicts . Last year , about 3 percent , or a total of 12,114 , of the calls to the hot line of the National Cancer Institute 's Cancer Information Service were about colon or rectal cancer . Within two days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country received 2,500 calls on colo-rectal tumors . Changing perspectives . A July 17 survey by the American Cancer Society found that people are now much more willing if not eager to undergo screening tests for colon cancer as a result of the President 's cancer . Nearly two thirds of the 258 people questioned said they would now ask for a stool blood test to detect hidden blood in the feces . Nearly half said they would ask for a " procto " ? a proctosigmoidoscopy , in which a physician examines the 26 U.S.NEWS &; WORLD REPORT , July 29 , 1985  | rectum and lower colon with a hollow lighted tube . In a 1982 survey , only 15 percent of Americans over the age of 40 felt they needed a stool-blood test and only 11 percent said they would undergo the procto exam . " Patients who have colon or rectal cancer are among the most fearful ? sometimes hiding their cancer from their children , " says Frances Feldman , professor of social work at the University of Southern California . " The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . " To many leaders in the medical community , Reagan is doing for colon cancer what Betty Ford and " Happy " Rockefeller did for breast cancer in 1974 when they talked openly about their cases and highlighted the need for early detection . " This led to a major change in attitudes toward breast cancer , with more women seeking help and having tests , " says Dr. Philip Furmanski , associate director of the AMC Cancer Research Center in suburban Denver . " It 's similar to what 's happening now in colo-rectal cancer . " Steps to recovery . Not only do public figures focus attention on the need for early detection of cancer , they also set an example of how to adjust to the disease . For all cancer patients and their families , including Reagan 's , the steps toward recovery are mental as well as physical . At first with the diagnosis , there is shock and disbelief . Then comes a turmoil phase , according to Dr. Jimmie Holland of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York . Many people suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . Within a week or 10 days , the crisis phase is over . " The President and Mrs. Reagan have set a good example in how to handle cancer by going about their normal lives , " says Dr. Susan Mellette , director of cancer rehabilitation services at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond . The emotional stress continues after the cancer has been treated , as survivors learn to live in uncertainty that their disease may return . Every time Reagan has a checkup , public anxiety is bound to increase . " The fear of recurrence is the biggest issue to deal with psychologically , " says Dr. Holland . " It 's that nagging worry ? did the doctors get it all ? Am I really O.K. ? " In time , most people adjust . Candida Finkel of Wilmette , Ill. , who had a thyroid cancer removed 20 years ago and now runs a cancer counseling service , says she rarely thinks about her disease . " I 'm convinced that being obsessive about it does n't help . Having cancer gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that they adjust better to their disease than does the rest of society . A significant number of survivors have trouble getting health insurance and suffer job discrimination . Sometimes , friends and co-workers have difficulty discussing the illness . Many colleagues still mistakenly assume that cancer is contagious and avoid contact on the job , leaving the cancer patient increasingly isolated . " Clearly , the President wo n't be subject to discrimination , " says Representative Mario Biaggi ( D-N.Y. ) , who has introduced legislation to outlaw job discrimination against cancer patients . " He 'll be back on the job , which is more than you can say for many cancer victims . The President 's illness should help sensitize employers to discrimination . " Although nearly 80 percent of male workers and more than 70 percent of female employes return to their jobs after cancer treatment , studies by USC 's Feldman found that 20 percent of and the magazine 's domestic bureaus white-collar workers suffered major discrimination such as being fired or demoted and 35 percent of blue-collar workers experienced similar problems , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as children . William Garchow , 53 , of Detroit , who was treated for an especially virulent form of lung cancer seven years ago , retired as a supervising auditor with a local manufacturing firm last October . " There was a gradual reduction in my duties and my salary until I had gone from supervising auditor to cost clerk , " he recalls . " Finally , they determined I was no longer needed . " In general , older survivors and those earning less than $7,500 encounter the most problems on the job . Despite these obstacles , many patients say there is often a positive side to illness . In a number of cases , employers go out of their way to bring in special equipment for cancer survivors . Patients also report a renewed commitment to their friends and family . The same may be true for the President . White House aides already are talking about his enhanced stature . The First Family has been swamped with get-well cards and sympathy notes . Super " stand-in . " Nancy Reagan 's daily visits to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband at state functions have raised the public consciousness of what it 's like to face cancer in your family and carry on . As Dr. Holland puts it : " As bad as the experience of cancer is , most people say : I 'm not sorry I went through it . I 'm a better person ; I 've faced death ; I know my priorities in life . ' "
