The assignment for the captain , Joshua Loring , was to make ships capable of challenging the French naval dominance of the lake. // Now , 225 years later , a team of nautical archeologists is excavating the wreck of the Boscawen , which is buried in mud under about seven feet of water . It is also excavating a French sloop that was captured by the British and an unidentified vessel that dates from the period of the French and Indian War. // " These vessels are probably the most significant record of colonial military ship construction , both French and English , in North America , " said Arthur B. Cohn , the vice chairman of the Lake Champlain Maritime Society , who is leading the team of divers doing the excavation . He called it " an undisturbed slice of 1760 naval life .

" <> <> The ' Great Bridge ' // // The three vessels were discovered last summer when Mr. Cohn was searching the lake bottom for the remains of the stone support caissons of the " Great Bridge " that American forces built in 1777 to span the southern part of Lake Champlain. // " We used a very sophisticated technique - of groping in the weeds with our hands , " he said .

" // The French forces retreated in 1759 after scuttling three of their sloops , the Musquelongy , the Esturgeon and the Brochette , in Cumberland Bay . The British salvaged the three sloops and rearmed them , and it is one of these sloops that the archeological team believes is among those it has found in the muddy waters off Fort Ticonderoga. // During the war the Boscawen was used to transport soldiers and supplies to British posts along the lake . But with the departure of the French from Canada , the strategic significance of Lake Champlain declined and the Boscawen , the Duke of Cumberland and at least one of the French sloops were moored at Ticonderoga . Stripped of their armament and rigging , they were presumably left there until they sank. // " We believe that these vessels , through disuse and rot , sank at their moorings where we have found them , " Mr. Cohn said. // In 1909 , the Duke of Cumberland , a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spot and raised . Efforts to preserve her failed , mainly because conservation techniques at the time were too primitive . All that remains of the ship is a pile of decaying planks amid a grove of trees below the fort. // In this first year of what is expected to be a five-year effort , the diving team is concentrating on excavating about two-thirds of the Boscawen . <> <> New Look at Ship-Building // // The 115-ton Boscawen measured 70 feet long , with a 23-foot beam . She carried 4 six-pounders and 12 four- pounders as well as 110 soldiers in addition to the crew . A six-pounder was a cannon capable of firing a six- pound ball. // " This is a new look at the way they built boats in the colonial period , " Mr. Crisman said . " This ship was probably designed by shipwrights from the coast , from New York , because it is very heavily built , overly built for conditions on the lake.

" // The project does not intend to raise the Boscawen for preservation - an undertaking that Mr. Crisman said would cost millions of dollars . Instead , it will use the drawings , photographs and videotapes of the wreck to do a reconstruction of the hull. // " This involves taking what exists of the curve of the hull , period drawings , what was put in the boat and do the best reconstruction possible , " Mr. Crisman said .
