txt AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said that the Reagan administration is using " brutal repressive measures " against the striking air traffic controllers and that the government is trying to break up their union . Mr. Kirkland made the comments at a regular three-day quarterly meeting of the AFL-CIO executive committee , which began here yesterday . The meeting included the election of Douglas A. Fraser , president of the United Auto Workers , to the AFL-CIO executive committee , as well as the approval of position papers critical of the Reagan administration economic program . But at a press conference , Mr. Kirkland confined his remarks almost exclusively to the air traffic controllers ' strike . He said he believes the public favors strong measures against the striking controllers , including fines and jail terms , but he characterized those threats as " a strike-breaking , unionbusting strategy . " He said the AFL-CIO has n't taken a position on job actions in support of the air traffic controllers , but will leave that decision to its affiliated unions in the airline industry . Mr. Kirkland said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " observing that " there are clearly quite serious problems in that area of employment . " He added , " I want people in the control tower whose morale is good and who do n't have to work under unacceptable strain and tension . " The air traffic controllers " should n't be smothered by threats of action that constitute harsh and brutal overkill , " he said . " The worst thing that can happen is if people are forced back to work under circumstances that hinder their performance . " Mr. Fraser 's election to the executive committee followed a vote by the UAW board last year to rejoin the AFL-CIO after a 13-year hiatus . The auto workers union pulled out of the huge labor organizaton in 1968 , but was asked to rejoin after Mr. Kirkland succeeded George Meany as AFL-CIO president in 1979 . Mr. Fraser attended the closed-door session but did n't appear at the press conference with Mr. Kirkland . The position papers approved by the executive committee  --  the first of several to be issued during the meeting  --  included criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee said the President 's tax cuts would add to " the economic problems and social tensions " caused by " shoestring public budgets . " The union said half of the $730 billion in revenue that it says will be lost during the next five years as a result of the cuts will go to business and " the wealthiest 5% to 10% of the population . " Future tax cuts tied to changes in the consumer pnce index " will cripple the ability of the federal government to meet pressing needs , " the union said . Other measures in the tax plan " widen the tax-avoidance opportunities for the wealthy , " the union said , in part by reducing estate and gift taxes . The measures will cut taxes of a family of four making $20,000 a year by $1,063 over three years , the AFL-CIO said , compared with a three-year cut of $12,607 for a family making $100,000 . The labor organization also issued a paper opposing deregulation of natural gas prices , a proposal under consideration by Congress .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
