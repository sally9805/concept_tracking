KENNER , La. - The trail of debris from Flight 759 starts at the back porch of Veral Crocker ' s small brick house . The 74-year-old widow was sitting outside Friday afternoon when she heard a roar and looked up in time to see the stricken Pan American jetliner skimming the tops of the cypress trees in her back yard . Before she could react , two pieces of metal torn from the plane crashed through the aluminum roof of the porch , barely missing her . Seconds later , a portion of the landing gear dropped into the middle of a well-manicured lawn a block away . What was left of the plane - the tail section , a small portion of the fuselage and an engine - crashed into a house across the street and exploded . At both ends of the plane ' s zigzagging path across the area , there was some good fortune . Crocker ' s house was spared . She was back sitting on her porch yesterday afternoon . The woman living in the house where the plane finally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the plane hit . And a police officer discovered a baby alive beneath the rubble of a house where searchers had presumed all were dead . But the stories of survival could not remove the choking stench of jet fuel or take away the gruesome spectacle of body bags and smoldering ruins . So violent was the surge of the plane through the neighborhood that some residents never got a chance to try to escape . " I heard an explosion , and before I knew it my house was on fire , " said Patricia Warr , who managed to get out with her 15-year- old son , Timothy , and a friend who was visiting . By the time she reached the street , her best friend ' s house next door had been leveled . " She was inside with the three little ones , " Warr said yesterday , as she stood outside the pile of brick and wood , shaking her head and crying softy . " They never had a chance . The place just went right up . " New Orleans International Airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was developed in the 1960s . None of the residents interviewed yesterday said they had had any concerns about the area ' s proximity to the airport when they moved in . George Bodey Jr. , a senior customer service agent for Delta Air Lines who has lived here for four years , said that while living in the neighborhood can be noisy , " they don ' t fly planes over here so much that it was going to bother anyone . " This area used to be all woods . We ' re the ones who moved in here . It wasn ' t the airport moving in on us . " Bodey was working Friday afternoon when he saw the airport ' s fire engines suddenly rush onto a runway . " I didn ' t think anything of it until I got a callfrom my boss to see him . He said there had been some kind of accident . " Bodey ' s wife and two of his daughters were at home when Flight 759 appeared over the trees at the far end of 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter was walking home . It was raining like hell and she had a cardboard box over her head . She heard the sputtering engines , and when she took away the box , she saw our house in flames . She thought her mother and sisters were dead and ran to get help . Bodey ' s wife and daughters had escaped after the plunging plane set their house aflame . " The whole neighborhood must have looked like it was on fire , " Bodey said . Wearing only shorts and a T-shirt in the muggy weather , Bodey returned to assess the damage to his home yesterday morning . His wife didn ' t go with him . " We ' ve had to hospitalize her , " he said . " She ' s hysterical . Everytime she hears a jet engine now she becomes hysterical . " From his vantage point at Hudson and 17th streets , Bodey had a 360-degree view of the damage caused by the plane . His own house nearby was uninhabitable . The roof was missing and the fire had destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the woods behind Crocker ' s home , caught fire and flipped , spewing gasoline and debris as it rolled over several times . They said that by the time the bulk of the plane stopped a few seconds later , it had cut a swath of more than than 500 feet through the neighborhood , taking telephone polls and wires and pieces of houses with it . Debris from the 13 houses it destroyed covered the streets along a nearly four-block area yesterday . All day , residents tried to salvage what they could . Patricia Warr ' s husband , William , a mailman , hoped he could salvage some uniforms . He couldn ' t . But he did find several pairs of shoes undamaged . " Look at that , " Mrs. Warr said , pointing to the white curtains in her living room , which survived the fire . " They ' re still there , but behind those curtains there ' s nothing . " A few blocks away , the plane ' s tail section , with its Pan Am insignia visible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the bodies of passengers trapped underneath the ruble . The carport of a nearby house was taken over by volunteer workers , who recorded their progess on an oversized chart tacked onto a wooden gate . Their notations revealed the difficulty of identifying the bodies . One read : " Male right foot . Identification unkown . " The volunteers ' spirits were buoyed for a short while Friday night when Gerald Hibbs , a firearms specialist with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff ' s Department , saw something moving beneath a mattress in the rubble of a house destroyed by fire during the crash . " I saw something move , so I picked up the mattress and I couldn ' t believe it , " he said yesterday . " It was a baby girl trying to push herself up . I just started screaming that I had a survivor . " The 16-month-old baby , Melissa Trahan , whose mother and sister were killed , was rushed to East Jefferson Hospital . She suffered second-degree burns to her toes and left hand . " She looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken and was splashing water on her , " Hibbs said . " I think that ' s what saved her . It did us a lot of good , that ' s for sure . "
