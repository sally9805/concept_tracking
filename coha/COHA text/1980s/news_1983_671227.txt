The eminent conductor , composer , pianist and author was holding a workshop in his living room in the Dakota the other day on " A Quiet Place , " a soon-to-be-produced opera that he was hearing in part for the first time - prompting , almost at once , a newly scribbled pianissimo in the score. // With a libretto by Stephen Wadsworth , the work will be a fulllength sequel to " Trouble in Tahiti , " the 40-minute opera whose music and words Mr. Bernstein wrote 30 years ago . It is the result , Mr. Bernstein said , of a " great collaboration " during the last two-and-a-half years with Mr. Wadsworth , a 30-year-old freelance writer , acting teacher and opera enthusiast . " I ' ve never been so happy in my life as collaborating on this opera , " the composer added . " Manically , almost. " // // A Triple Commission // " A Quiet Place " had a triple commission , by the Houston Grand Opera , the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and Teatro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trouble in Tahiti " at each place in turn , starting with Houston on June 17. // " Trouble in Tahiti " was a " cartoon " satire on the supposed good life in suburbia . With a Greek chorus of three in the background , its two characters - Dinah and Sam - bickered and then revealed , alone , the pain of their alienation , finally retreating together to the balm of a silly movie. // " A Quiet Place " picks up that family 30 years later , and Mr. Bernstein said , " It ' s no longer that cartoon piece . " It begins as members of the family gather after a long separation for the funeral of Dinah , who has been killed in an apparently suicidal car crash . Those at the funeral include Sam ; their 40-year-old son , Junior , who is psychotic ; Junior ' s sister , Didi ; her husband , Francois , who was once Junior ' s lover , and Dinah ' s brother Bill. // The family members " try to reach out and touch one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opera ends , he said , with " an acknowledgment of the difficulties involved in this great task. " // " For me , it is what one would call a happy ending , " Mr. Bernstein said affably after the workshop . " It ' s very hopeful , " he added , because the characters come to understand the need to accept each other ' s differences . <> <> Opera Has Been His Life // Mr. Wadsworth , who studied singing for eight years , says opera has been his life since the age of 3 , when he heard " Don Giovanni " at the Metropolitan Opera House . He has staged two works at the Skylight Opera in Milwaukee and has taught acting for singers . He was also a managing editor of Opera News and a contributing editor of Saturday Review. // Introduced to Mr. Bernstein by the composer ' s daughter Jamie , whom he had known at Harvard , Mr. Wadsworth later arrived to interview him for Saturday Review and mentioned that he had some ideas about a sequel to " Trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recalled that his first reaction was : " ' You , callow youth ? ' Here was this young kid less than half my age. " // But , half in jest , he asked for a synopsis within a few days , and Mr. Wadsworth complied , providing a draft showing that " his ideas jibed with mine . " One thing they had in common was a recent death in the family : Mr. Bernstein ' s wife and Mr. Wadsworth ' s sister - losses that had prompted each of them to envision a funeral scene in the sequel. // " I always wanted to write a sequel , " the composer said . " I had an idea and couldn ' t get beyond that . " The plot emerged painstakingly . " We talk for months about what the characters are going to say , " Mr. Wadsworth reported . " Then I write the words , and we sit down again and rework them . There ' s a great deal of revision and chat. " // " He has incredibly sensitive ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fitness of certain musical ideas . ' Does this go too far ? ' I ' ll ask him . ' Does this evoke in you the feeling you meant when you wrote the words ? ' " <> <> Neither Rhyme nor Verse // " Trouble in Tahiti " was an outgrowth of the Broadway musical , rooted in popular song , Mr. Bernstein said . In contrast , " A Quiet Place " " doesn ' t have stanzaic forms ; it doesn ' t rhyme and it ' s not in verse. " // The lines are naturalistic to the point of including hesitations , some of which needed attention during the workshop . When Junior says , " You must be Daddy , " Mr. Bernstein told the singer , " it ' s almost whispering ; he hasn ' t seen his father in 20 years . " But when the character stammers " ' Have you met Francois , my l-ll-ll-little sister ' s husband ? ' " he said , " make a crescendo in trying to get out ' little. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the work , including 12-tone for the " boring " funeral director , whose lines Mr. Bernstein delivered during the workshop , filling in for an absent singer and mugging unctuously . An Ivesian touch occurs at one point , he said , when new-found conviviality in the family sours , and " the orchestra is playing something totally different from the chorus in the background . " Basically , he said , he believes his collaborator ' s assessment that " every bar of this opera has a deep , hidden root somewhere in jazz. " // Mr. Bernstein has long hoped for " a real American opera with roots in the American musical , " much as German opera , he said , emerged from the singspiel in Vienna , by way of Mozart ' s " Magic Flute . " <> <> An American Opera // By American opera , he means one using vernacular , nonregional speech and vernacular music - that is to say , jazz . " Porgy and Bess " is " great , " he said , but , like other American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side Story " ( 1957 ) , which had a book by Arthur Laurents and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim , turned out , Mr. Bernstein said , to be a step toward that goal. // The next step was his " Mass , " written for the opening of the Kennedy Center in 1971 , with a text mostly from the Roman Catholic liturgy . In between were attempts that never came to fruition : " 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , " for instance , which had book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner , and which , he says , " started with such great ideas " but was drastically altered at the suggestion of others , a victim of Broadway ' s expense and greed. // In Mr. Bernstein ' s view , the commercial musical theater has " gone backwards " in quality in recent years , with the exception of some of Mr. Sondheim ' s works . And the pressures these days for box-office success make it impossible to write as one wishes . So he has turned from Broadway. // " ' A Quiet Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American musical a step farther , " he said . " It is qualitatively different . It is opera written for the opera house . " Is it the kind of American opera he has long envisioned ? " What a question to ask , " Mr. Bernstein said , " when we are in the middle of writing the end. " //
