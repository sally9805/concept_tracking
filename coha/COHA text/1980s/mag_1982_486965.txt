The twentieth New York Film Festival , which ran at Lincoln Center from September 24 to October 10 ( and kicked off commercial openings for most of the selections I 've covered ) was loaded with personality , causing a desirable level of dissension . There was even one great movie , the Taviani brothers ' The Night of the Shooting Stars . It wo n't open until January , but it put the other Festival features into perspective . Filmmakers around the world seem to be struggling with problems of distance  --  from their material and their audiences  --  that the Tavianis freely resolve . Paolo and Vittorio Taviani are the most original lyric filmmakers to reach us from Italy since early Bertolucci , and The Night of the Shooting Stars is a lovely , ardent work . Balancing the fiercer emotions of their 1977 Padre Padrone , they interpret their teen-age memories of a Tuscan town during World War II with a tensed poise that says , like one character , " It 's raining , but the sun is shining . " , In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mined by the Nazis , and split into two groups . One finds shelter in the supposedly safe cathedral ; the other , which includes a 6-year-old girl , is less trustful , and sets out on foot in the rumored direction of the American front lines . Even the tragic episodes have a comic timing , a festive shape , crystallized by the fearless amazement of the little girl and by the perspective of forty years . On this journey , the Tavianis are discovering the sources of their sense of proportion as artists : their art is the matured form of the child 's wicked , innocent pleasure in the midst of disaster . This is the most purely Tuscan movie I 've ever seen . Delightful proportions are Tuscany 's visual language ; the Tavianis quicken it into a personal slang with fresh , modern inflections of local idioms . At times , the movie looks like a collaboration between Ucello and Veronica Geng has reviewed movies for The New York Review of Books . She was also a film critic for Soho News . Godard . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover of darkness , what the Tavianis see is the funny and powerful spectacle of twenty or thirty bodies all wrestling into camouflage-black dresses and overcoats at the same time . That night , the group pauses on a hilltop , listening for the explosions that will tell them the tinted walls of their houses are being blown apart . The Tavianis paint the moment as a series of details : the curled forms and rosy translucence of ears that always seem to be hearing Verdi . No movie could come by its painterliness more deservedly or more intuitively . The sleeping bodies in a communal foxhole are , for an instant , like the figures in a rotunda ceiling fresco . This is n't merely pictorial ; it 's an impulsive fusion of art and life . Most of us would look down at the foxhole and up at the fresco ; the Tavianis see both at once . Their politics is communal without denying the individuality of artists . The Night of the Shooting Stars is an act of selfish joy in art  --  and a generous act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The movie 's passionate climaxes are visions boldly imagined by conscious artists , but the elements  --  a platoon of Sicilian-American G.I.s , Achilles turning his blazing shield and spear toward Hector  --  are images of hope and heroism drawn from a communal consciousness . The Tavianis do n't Illy ' everfbedy is an artist ; they say ail is everybody . The Tavianis ' work springs from a fertile relationship with their culture . What can happen when that relationship gets displaced is suggested by Jerzy Skolimowski 's Moonlighting . A Pole who has worked mostlYin exile since the 1960s , Skolimowski was in London during the recent military takeover in Poland , and in an almost journalistic response , he made Moonlighting in less than three months . Four Polish construction workers , sent to London as illegal laborers to renovate a pied d l'Angleterre for their rich boss , are stranded there when planes and phone calls to Poland are suspended during the crisis . The foreman ( Jeremy Irons ) , the only English-speaker among them , becomes a scavenger and improviser of power . Irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavic it is  --  deceptively raw , in command of a sly gallows humor . On a spontaneous impulse , Skolimowski has made a highly controlled movie about spontaneity in a situation squeezed dry of possibilities . He draws these paradoxes with a Rapidographmore architectural draftsmanship than free sketch . Like the workers , the movie does its absurd little construction job . Skolimowski is a resourceful modernist ; he builds with the negative materials at hand . It 's his style to build elegantly ; the stresses are only palpable because they 're so emphatically denied . In the 1967 anthology movie Far from Vietnam , Godard was seen pinned behind a camera , talking to another camera on his balcony in Paris ; what you really saw was the stress of his separation  --  in his case , cultural as well as geographic  --  from his subject . You ca n't ask Skolimowski for that messy directness , but I missed it . Moonlighting perfectly abstracts the contours of Skolimowski 's personal position in December 1981 ; if you squint , it 's a fable about power . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Tuscans can take design for granted , Skolimowski and his Poles in Nowheresville cling to it as if its rigor is all they have left . Yet the mysteriously honored privacy of the three workers who speak only in untranslated Polish hints at a richer reality hibernating in the frOzen abstraction . Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's alienation-by-decor and willed defeatism are a different matter , and I 've never been in the coterie that appreciates them . Veronika Voss ( finished just before Fassbinder 's death last June ) is a grim burlesque of Sunset Boulevard ; the dominant tone could be the shriek of fingernails etching the curlicues into the numerous glass doors . But the other Fassbinder selection , Bolwieser ( The Stationmaster 's Wife ) , made in 1977 for German TV , is full-blooded and compelling ( deserving U.S. distribution to counter Veronika 's empty flash ) . Based on a 1931 novel by Oskar Maria Graf , it 's about a small-town Bavarian railroad official whose fear of appearing henpecked plays into his bride 's lusty independence . These people have their own cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving you room to respond . The strain is relieved by bursts of vicious comedy that build to a satisfying travesty of courtroom justice : with the husband telling so many lies that they 're the transparent equivalent of truth , the right guy gets the wrong comeuppance for the wrong reasons . Filmmakers working under political repression have to deal with the distance between their own backs and the censors . The three selections from Hungary represented a range of strategies , from coded fourteenth-century theatrics about the illusion of power ( Mild &; JancsO 's The Tyrant 's Heart ) to realistic message-drama about the political persecution of two lesbian newspaper reporters ( Karoly Makk 's Another Way ) . The most likable and informative is Peter Goth  --  r 's Time Stands Still ( opening in New York City on October 20 ) , about Hungarian teenagers caught between the glare of the 1960s ' neon promise and the shadow of the crushed 1956 uprising . Gothar was in his mid-teens in the 1960s , and he eggs on his characters with loving apprehension : the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Elvis-profiled heavy- - turned-hero , when he 's expelled for yelling over the school P.A. system , " Up with nothing ! ' Blueberry Hill ' ! " Time Stands Still has a terrific music track ( U.S. rock-and-roll and an equally danceable , emotional Hungarian score ) and one of the world 's best cinematographers , Lajos Koltai , who colors the " golden age " of the 1960s a fragile ash-blond . Such a full experience that it 's not always easy to follow , Time Stands Still lets you hold onto exhilaration right through a purple-haze decrescendo and wrenching black-and-white coda . Yilmaz Gimey , a Turkish star and director of action epics whose work took a political turn in the 1960s , made his new movie , Yol , in a situation the reverse of Skolimowski 's : he was in his native country but physically cut off from his movie , directing it from prison . ( Since the 1960s , he has served time on and off for politiCal crimes ; in 1974 , he was imprisoned for murder . In 1980 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Githey escaped to Europe , where he edited Yol , but his remoteness from its production makes it hard to evaluate except as a social document . It follows five men on leave from prison , returning to equally brutal lives . What 's startling is that Gi.iney zeroes in with deadly seriousness on sexual politics , linking state oppression with patriarchal vengeance , macho jealousy and the antisexual frenzy of railroad passengers who try to lynch a reunited married couple for making love in the bathroom . Yol is n't an experience I can " recommend " ? it 's almost all pain . But Giiney obviously has some kind of big-scale talent for conscientious populism , and there must be more to it than he could express while locked up . The male self-reproach of Antonioni 's new Identification of a Woman has been better served by the funky audience-rapport of De Palma , Godard and even Fellini ; paradoxically , Antonioni got closest to the audience in two long , gripping passages of enigma before he showed his hand . Less effectively aloof was Isabelle Huppert , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arid stream-bed of multinational sex-and-power politics . Satire needs skillful positioning . The English filmmaker Peter Greenaway mocked art patronage in his first feature , The Draughtsman 's Contract , a conceptual Restoration thriller whose fastidious shots caromed and ricocheted across a green-baize billiard table of an estate in Kent . The dripping wigs and innuendo would have been even more delicious if Greenaway had n't Fauntleroyishly clutched his toy fops to his chest , begrudging others the chance to play . The modest-budget independent American features Eating Raoul and Vortex chose targets the size of barn doors ( sexual swingers and up-tight gourmets ; private-eye flicks and Howard Hughes ) and then listlessly tossed a few darts ( Vortex more stylishly ) , smugly savoring their advantage . The wholehearted , robust American movies were the shorts , especially Stephen S. Weiss 's twilight voyeurism in Miami Is Okay ( Miami , Oklahoma , that is ) and George Kuchar 's hilarious Wild Night in El Reno . A model of how to build intensity from remoteness , Wild Night vigorously mixed six minutes of repeated images  --  weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a window , a man running away from a phone booth at night  --  into an uninhibited , depraved all-night party . Kuchar could have been illustrating the directorial maxim " If you know how to shoot mountains , then you know how to shoot people . " ( Attributed to Lubitsch , the line was read by Godard in his short , Letter to Freddy Buache  --  rather clotted , dispirited , stop-motion footage of the environs and people of Lausanne , Switzerland , finally snapping together with the Lubitsch quote . ) Werner Herzog , whose Fitzcarraldo closed the Festival , seems to have forgotten how to shoot people or mountains . He 's returned with glazed eyes to the location so memorable from his great Aguirre , The Wrath of God ( 1973 ) , which went down the Peruvian Amazon with conquistadors . Aguirre quivered with alertness  --  intimate with shifts in terrain and water , with rustling rodents , with whispers and insinuations Newsreel Novels ARNOLD KLEIN IN THE CITY OF FEAR .

After observing most of the Northeast Corridor through the green-tinted windows of the train , I put on my sunglasses as we pulled into town and voiki , the two tints combined to screen out all color , and the city appeared in black and white , as in a newsreel . I fully expected to be met at Union Station by Cordell Hull . That was many years ago , but I have never been able to shake the feeling that Washington is a city without color and , for that matter , a city without any reality at all .

Herzog 's other movies , too , were all vibes . Fitzcarraldo has Kinski , directed fortissimo from the word go , as a wild-and-crazy Irish entrepreneur obsessed with bringing opera to the jungle and moving a steamship across a hill . This movie is n't alert to anything except Herzog 's self-congratulatory bravado , using Claudia Cardinale as an innocent mouthpiece : " It 's only the dreamers who move mountains . " Herzog once said , in the course of eating his shoe as a publicity stunt for another filmmaker , that capitalist society turns everyone into " a clown . " Fitzcarraldo 's heavy buffoonery seems a sad sacrifice of Herzog 's past art to press that political point . 1:1 were real themselves . They have , of course , a different view of the matter . " You do n't exist , " I said recently to a Washington bureaucrat , interrupting his tedious story of some ministry or other , and was shocked to discover that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more real to Washington than Washington is to America . Ward Just 's new novel , In the City of Fear , offers a glimpse into what Washingtonians think about themselves , and ' I am glad to report that I 'm right : They do n't exist . Of course this impression may simply be the result of Just 's middling competence as a novelist , but I 'd rather think not : the book is very much an insider 's account , packed with vacuous aphorisms such as might actually fall from thin , knowing lips well accustomed to the fawning of the Washington press corps . Furthermore one of the characters  --  a President of the United States  --  is based on a real ( or rather " real " ) person , and no doubt some of the others , a Top Adviser and a Foreign Editor at a Great Washington Newspaper , are too . The most convincing aspect of Just 's characters , however  --  the thing that gives them the real tang of truth  --  is that they take Washington so seriously : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady , capital letters and all . Unfortunately , Just has no clue as to how ridiculous such awed expressions sound to ears accustomed to genuine human speech ; he takes the Capital even more
