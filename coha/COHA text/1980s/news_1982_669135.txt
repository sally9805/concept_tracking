The film stops . The lights go on . The Jacksonville police officer showing the film  --  he is known to the youngsters as Officer Friendly - asks the class : ' ' What would you do ? ' ' // Hands shoot up . The boys and girls give their ideas . A few relate similar instances of strangers approaching them . Then Officer Friendly starts the film again and the children hear the message : Don ' t talk to strangers . Don ' t accept anything . Tell the incident to an adult you know and trust. // The film , ' ' Better Safe Than Sorry , ' ' is part of the Danger-Stranger program presented each year to 100 , 000 Duval County schoolchildren in Florida by the four members of the Officer Friendly unit of the Jacksonville Police . Its aim is to give children an awareness of possible dangers and the courage to protect themselves. // ' ' The children respond because the narrators are youngsters like themselves , ' ' says Sgt. Emmett Lee , coordinator of the Officer Friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shoulder and it comes from their peers , not from an adult who tries to scare them or preach at them . It ' s something they can accept and relate to. ' ' // The young narrators explain at the beginning of the film that the incidents to be shown don ' t happen very often but that as children get older , ' ' it ' s time for us to watch out for ourselves - to use our heads and think before we act. ' ' // Some of the situations and the advice given : // * A man and woman in a car offer a ride , saying : ' ' We know your parents . ' ' Keep walking . Say , ' ' I ' m sorry but my mom doesn ' t want me to take a ride from anyone . ' ' It ' s a hard choice . They seem like nice people  --  but ' ' better safe than sorry . ' ' Never get in a car . Never hitchhike. // * A car follows beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way . If the car turns , too , go at once to a nearby store , house , people . Don ' t be afraid to ask for help . Don ' t go places alone . Go with a friend. // * At home when parents are away , someone phones and asks questions , supposedly for a survey : ' ' How old are you ? Are you home alone ? ' ' Never give out information to anyone you don ' t know . Never admit you are home alone . Never let anyone into the house . Before parents leave , ask for a number to call or place to go if you need help. // * A girl is shopping when a stranger comes up , talks nicely , puts an arm around her . This is not someone being friendly like parents or relatives . If grabbed , get away , scream , get help from clerks , shoppers . Don ' t be afraid to make a scene. // The film  --  from Film Fair Communications , 10900 Ventura Boulevard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civic groups nationwide. // Another aspect of Jacksonville ' s Danger-Stranger program is training children to look upon police officers as friends to turn to in a crisis . Officer Friendly appears in full uniform and explains his role in finding lost children , investigating accidents , arresting people ' ' who break the law or try to hurt children or their parents , ' ' and finds stolen articles , such as bikes. // The police officer is presented as a family person with a caring attitude toward children , not the traditional authority figure children were once taught to fear. // A ' ' Safe House ' ' program is an important adjunct to Danger-Stranger . More than 2 , 500 homes display window cards which children are taught to recognize as places where trustworthy people trained to call police are eager to help in any emergency . The cards bear the police phone number on the front and step-by-step instructions on the back for the precise reporting of an incident . A code number known only to caller and police protects the program from abuse. // M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven of her 10 years on the police force , says it ' s so commonplace for parents and children to tell her they were protected by something taught in the Danger-Stranger program that she doesn ' t keep track of it. // ' ' Once a school principal said her daughter was approached by two strange men in a car but the child knew what to do and got the help she needed , ' ' Officer Rogers says . ' ' That ' s gratifying. ' ' // Children frequently send drawings and thank-you letters . Among those posted at police headquarters : // ' ' Thank you for sharing all the nice things . I hope we can share again. ' ' // ' ' We thank you for the movie . Thank you for letting us see your police car . We will not talk to strangers. ' ' // With a stick drawing of a little boy walking toward a police officer : ' ' Little boy lost will tell police his address . The police will help him. ' ' // With a clown holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will not take his candy. ' ' // The children are given police badges , certificates , and coloring books which repeat all the safety rules concerning traffic , bicycles , and personal protection . Parents are asked to review the book with their offspring. // The Officer Friendly unit was founded in 1970 by the consolidated Office of the Sheriff and Jacksonville Police . The unit also trains and supervises adult school crossing guards and the school safety patrol program , conducts a Police Youth recreational program , and recently initiated an antidrug program for older children. // Officer J. F. Wiggins received a three-page thank-you from Neil Nichols and Greg Miller of University Christian School saying : ' ' Dear Joe , I know that when some of my classmates are offered any kind of drugs , because of you they will think twice about accepting. ' ' // There are about 250 Officer Friendly programs throughout the country . Costs are borne by the various police departments . Educational materials are underwritten by grants from the Sears-Roebuck Foundation . Many communities also have variations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game is education and prevention , ' ' says Sergeant Lee . ' ' We deal with hardened criminals that we never were able to reach , and that ' s sad . If we can teach our children not to break the law  --  and to save themselves from harm  --  we will have done something constructive. ' ' // //
