Someone once said that no man should be ashamed of his poverty ; he should get rid of it as fast as he can . Texas Governor William Clements did just that , transforming himself from an oilfield roughneck to the millionaire founder of Sedco Inc. , one of the world 's largest offshore drilling companies . As the first Republican Governor of the Lone Star State in more than a century , " Dollar Bill " Clements , 65 , who is seeking a second term this year , is proud to say , " The people of Texas like the idea that I can call the White House and someone will pick up the phone . " <P> Democratic Challenger Mark White , 42 , the state attorney general , responds that Clements ' connections have done Texas precious little good . There are more than 500,000 Texans out of work , and White is determined to pin the blame on Clements and the Republican economic policies that the Governor supports . Billing himself as both a law-and-order candidate and a consumer advocate , he charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Unfortunately for White , organization and cash often matter more than sensitivity in Texas politics , and Clements has the edge on both . The incumbent has raised nearly $10 million ( $3.5 million came from a fund-raising dinner last June attended by President Reagan ) , and will probably outspend White by more than 3 to l . <P> White 's best hope is getting out a large vote in the heavily Democratic state . Both candidates have fervently courted the Mexican Americans of south Texas , who usually vote Democratic , but even there Clements has some advantages . He may be seen as the candidate of " the Anglos and the big-business interests , " as one Hispanic activist put it , but White is remembered as the attorney general who fought bilingual education and public schooling for children of illegal aliens . Earlier , as Texas secretary of state in 1975 , White opposed extension of the Voting Rights Act . Says Roy Barrera Jr. , a Hispanic judge appointed by Clements : " The young Hispanics are not locked into the Democrats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Clements is " a clown " who uses " smear tactics . " Clements says the attorney general " is an incompetent lawyer " who has lost most of his big cases . Responding , somewhat lamely , that he has won most of those that he appealed , White declares : " The heroes in Texas were at the Alamo and San Jacinto . You 've got to fight . " Facing Dollar Bill 's well-oiled assault , state Democratic leaders are wondering if , like the Texans at the Alamo , White lacks the organization and resources to win .
