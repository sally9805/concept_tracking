On Sunday afternoon , before 114,500 manic soccer fans at the World Cup final in Mexico City 's mighty Azteca Stadium , soccer 's El Rey , its king , its little Dieguito , was finally crowned . True , it was the right foot of another Argentine , Jorge Burruchaga , that sealed the 3-2 victory over West Germany in the game 's 84th minute , slanting the ball low and fast past a despairing , spread-eagled Harald Schumacher into the net . But the play that set up the goal  --  indeed , the plays that set up all of Argentina 's goals  --  was conceived by Diego Armando Maradona , captain of his country 's team , without doubt the most dangerous attacker in soccer and , by extension , the most famous and admired team athlete in the world . // Imagine Wayne Gretzky or Larry Bird performing in a dominion of billions  --  not just millions  --  of fans , against a dizzying progression of defenses  --  zones , man-to-mans , traps  --  designed solely to stop him , running nonstop for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his knees , and you begin to appreciate the athletic genius of the 5 ' 5 " , 152-pound , 25-year-old striker named Maradona . Just when Argentina 's World Cup seemed to be slipping away Sunday because West Germany had been able to hold Maradona goalless , he eluded Karlheinz Foerster , his second-half shadower , picked up a loose ball and , with a precision that borders on the supernatural , stabbed a pass through a line of four German defenders to Burruchaga , on a dead run and barely breaking pace , for the score . // In a few moments the World Cup would be Argentina 's for the second time in eight years  --  it won the tournament in Buenos Aires in 1978  --  and tears would be rolling down the Indio features of Maradona as he clutched the ugliest , most desired trophy in world sport . // It was a fitting end to a week dominated by what could only be described as Mar-Idolatry . Even Dieguito 's horoscope was discussed with passion . ( The Mexico City News , somewhat impractically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hiking trip could provide a needed change of pace . ) In Buenos Aires , both Argentina 's and Maradona 's coronation had already taken place , Monsignor Jorge Caseretto of the diocese of San Isidro declaring that he had already arranged a victory with God . Street posters declared MARADONA PRESIDENTE ! // Any and all other pretenders to soccer superstardom had already disappeared . Brazil had been eliminated in the quarterfinals by France , and the great Frenchman , Michel Platini , turned out to be not so great as he and his elegant teammates had fallen in Wednesday 's semifinals , 2-0 , to the workmanlike West Germans . // The swashbuckling Maradona , meanwhile , almost single-handedly disposed of the tough Belgians in Argentina 's semifinal match , effectively responding to what may well have been the most ill-considered remark of the tournament . Before the game Belgian goalie Jean-Marie Pfaff had declared , " Maradona is nothing special . " // Whirling , slicing and stutter-stepping through Belgium 's zone defense  --  " We do not have one player capable of stopping Maradona , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first goal 6 minutes into the second half on a Hector Enrique pass , chipping the ball in left-footed from close range . And only 12 minutes later he went solo from 25 yards out , sealing a 2-0 Argentina victory with a goal  --  his fifth of the tournament  --  that was almost a mirror image of his spectacular 55-yard run for a goal in the quarterfinals against England . ( A goal , incidentally , that is already commemorated by a plaque at Azteca . ) For Dieguito 's fans , who , national loyalties aside , number just about every soccer fan in the world , his performance in the Belgium game confirmed that he was the brightest star of the Mundial , the new king of soccer . // But West Germany was not about to concede him his crown without a fight . About 135 miles northwest of Mexico City , close to the little colonial town of Quet ? raro in a charming 18th-century hacienda-turned-hotel , all soft-pink adobe , the Germans formulated their plan . This was Der Kaiserkampf , where Franz Beckenbauer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national team 's coach , rallied his troops for the final assault on Sunday . Beckenbauer was still slightly amazed that his team had even reached the final , especially in light of the progression of pallid performances on the field and the comic opera events off it that had marked West Germany 's early games . // For starters , there was the Sex in Mexico story  --  women allegedly seen coming and going from the players ' hotel rooms  --  originated by a German journalist . Next , there was the running feud between star striker Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and goalie Schumacher , who were each filing columns to rival newspapers back home . All the while , Beckenbauer missed few opportunities to bad-mouth his own team . // " Stupid , " he called it after a 1-1 tie with Uruguay in its first game of the round-robin phase . " Garbage ! " he said following a 2-1 defeat of Scotland . Then , after a 2-0 loss to Denmark , advised by his team doctor to take it a little easier on his men , Beckenbauer told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've played . " Whereupon the press dissolved in laughter . // West Germany had managed to sneak through its semi with France by scoring an early , lucky goal after a free kick , then hanging on until the Frenchmen 's frustration became so intense that Rudolf Voeller was able to lob the ball over goal-tender Joel Bats and into the net in the game 's final minutes . So West Germany was in the World Cup final for a record fifth time , and Beckenbauer had a new preoccupation : Dieguito , el cebollita , the little onion himself . Franz , as usual , was frank . " He is the best player in the World Cup , " the German coach said . " The best player in the world . We will do our best to put him out of the game , but it is almost impossible . " // Those words did n't frighten Diego , not after playing two seasons as a marked man with Naples in the notoriously physical Italian league . But neither was Maradona as unimpressed with the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's strong point is that it plays like a team , " he said . " It never gives up . It is hard and tough-tackling . I 'd be ignorant not to have the greatest respect for their men , for Karlheinz Foerster , Lothar Matthaeus , the ones they 'll put on me . But that 's fine . If they use all that manpower to cancel me out , we let loose Burruchaga or Jorge Valdano . I especially want Valdano strong for the final . " // How many games can a single genius win on his own ? The answer is : as many as he needs to . For although Maradona scored no goals , he surely won the game . Still , when the final against West Germany began , it seemed that Maradona had been right to consider the threat a strong one . Brilliantly prepared by the demanding Beckenbauer , the Germans appeared to be a new team , attacking from the start , rather than playing cautious defense against the freewheeling Argentines as most had expected . Unexpectedly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullback , Jose Luis Brown . // Joe Louis , as the English-speaking press delighted in referring to him , bears no relation to the great heavyweight champ , except perhaps in courage . Brown opened the scoring after Matthaeus , who spent the first half glued to Maradona , fouled the Argentina star and yielded a free kick . Burruchaga centered the ball and Joe  --  sorry  --  Jose unorthodoxly ran up from the defense to head it home and give Argentina a 1-0 lead . That score held through the first half , which was fine for the South Americans , except that soccer historians recalled that in its two championship years , 1954 and 1974 , West Germany had come from behind to win . // As the second half began , West Germany 's Norbert Eder , running in for a heading shot , crashed into Brown 's right shoulder and appeared to displace it . Refusing to leave the field in spite of obvious pain , Brown played out the game with his right arm in a makeshift sling , his thumb hooked in a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown heroically anchoring the defense , Argentina struck again 10 minutes into the second half . Maradona reached midfielder Hector Enrique with the ball , and Enrique sent it along to Valdano , who found a huge , undefended gap on the German left side and made the score 2-0. // But the West Germans , as Diego had predicted , would not die easily . From a corner kick , Voeller , an extra attacker who had been sent into the game early in the second half by Beckenbauer , headed it down in front of the goal to Rummenigge 's right foot and it was 2-1 with 17 minutes left . // Only 7 minutes later , a second shock : From another corner kick , with eight Germans packed around the goalmouth , the ball found its way to the head of Voeller . Incredibly , it was 2-2 . Until , that is , Dieguito once more stepped in and sent the pass to Burruchaga for the winning goal that ensured that tradition would stand : No World Cup fought in Latin America has ever been won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aires people danced and car horns hooted ; in some neighborhoods , celebration turned into rioting and at least three people were killed . There were fresh demands that Dieguito return home to play for an Argentine club . But he is happy in Naples , he says . And those close to Maradona declare he is still bitter that it has taken him , a cabecita negra  --  a " black head " as Argentines of Indian blood are demeaningly called  --  so long to be accepted by upper-crust Argentines. // No one in Buenos Aires would use the expression for Diego now , of course . He is El Rey . The King .
