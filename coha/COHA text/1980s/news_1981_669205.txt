When Krisztina Regoczy and Andras Sallay returned to Budapest , they did so with their country ' s first winter medal since 1956. // Today , as featured performers with the combined Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice show , they are introduced as Olympic silver medalists and 1980 world ice dancing champions . While accurate , the " intro " just skims the surface of their fascinating story. // Olympic spectators got a glimmer of how special it is during the opening ceremonies of last winter ' s Lake Placid games . While phalanxes of athletes paraded behind many national placards , Krisztina and Andras , the only members of the Hungarian team , made for lonely standard-bearers. // Hungary has never made much of a dent at the Winter Olympics and probably never will . " There are no hills and no snow in our country , " says Andras , only slightly exaggerating . In fact , Hungary , a nation smaller than Indiana , lies within the middle basin of the Danube River , and therefore is far flatter than neighboring Austria. // Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor rinks . To find the necessary coaching and practice facilities , serious skaters like Regoczy and Sallay may travel abroad. // They spent 12 summers in Richmond , England , training first under Roy Callaway and later his wife , Betty . The experience helps account for their command of the King ' s English , plus their emergence as world-class ice dancers. // The British , who enjoy a rich skating tradition , joined with Americans to launch ice dancing as a competitive discipline in the late 1940s . The ' 50s saw British skaters dominate the sport , which takes its lead from Viennese waltzes written more than a century ago . Couples execute original and set dance steps to music , but without the spectacularly high lifts that characterize pairs skating. // As with so many events , the USSR soon asserted itself , no doubt in anticipation of ice dancing becoming an Olympic sport , which it did in 1976 . Having monopolized the world championships for a decade , the Soviet ice dancers entered the Lake Placid games as heavily favored as the hockey team. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Regoczy and Sallay became darlings of the crowd with their charm and stylish interpretation of Hungarian folk dances. // For several years they nipped at the bootheels of various Soviet skaters , finishing second or third in every European and world championship from 1977 on . This time they would come agonizingly close , losing a razor-thin decision for the gold to the USSR ' s Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karponosov by a mere 0. 96 of a point . To some observers , the 5-4 split decision represented another case of questionable judging. // Despite the momentary sting , however , the Hungarian couple graciously accepted the outcome. // " We were a little disappointed to have come so close to winning the gold , but pleased that we skated our best , " Krisztina says. // " Skating for the audience has always been the main point of our skating , " Andras adds . " It was great to hear the applause at Lake Placid . We didn ' t really think that much about our marks or the color of the medal. " // Competitors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world championships several weeks later and skated away with first place . To claim the title , they broke the Soviet stranglehold by beating Linichuk and Karposonov . Making it to this pinnacle is a fairy tale come true . As mentioned earlier , Hungary ' s winter sports heritage is nothing to write home about , even if you happen to live in Hodmezovasarhely or Szekesfehervar. // Before 1980 , Hungary had won a less-than-grand total of five Olympic medals in winter competition , four bronzes , and a silver , all in pairs skating . The citizenry generally looks forward to the summer games , where Hungarian athletes pick off medals in sports such as Greco-Roman wrestling , weightlifting , fencing , and kayaking. // Of course , the Olympic incident that Americans probably most associate with Hungary was the infamous , fight- marred water polo game between Hungary and the Soviet Union in 1956 . Emotions were running high at the time , since the Soviets had just suppressed a Hungarian revolution . Hungary won the water polo match , though , and eventually the gold. // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers sensed the Hungarians were somehow different from their Soviet counterparts . They are not the one- track performers many state-supported athletes seem to be . Krisztina has complete two years of dental studies , and Andras , an avid oil painter , is an antique dealer back home. // Their ability to " play " to the audience appealed to the ice shows , which aren ' t known for signing East Europeans . The Follies made the most attractive pitch , inking them to skate with the " silver unit , " one of three separate traveling companies . Linda Fratianne is the superstar of this American- based troupe. // Through the cast is a big one , with more than 100 members , Krisztina and Andras find they miss seeing their former rivals , to say nothing of home . The pair , which returns to Budapest this summer , has been i n the United States since last April. // The two skaters enjoy a Tai-and-Randy type of relationship , like that of Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner. " it ' s not like a marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can ' t actually explain it , but it ' s more of a brother- sister sort of thing. " // The two were first teamed in 1967 by the trainer of the Budapest Sports Club and have been skating together ever since . The 14th anniversary of their partnership occurred Feb. 17 , a date Andras remembered with flowers. // They ' re not ones to forget special occasions or friends and practically insist that Robert Deri , the father-figure manager of the Budapest club , be mentioned in articles about them. // Show skating , they ' ve found , has not been a lark . It means a different city and rink every other week , generally two and sometimes three performances a day , and plenty of late- night dinners. // On the ice the challenge is to get " up " for every show . " You do the same routine so many times that it almost becomes dangerous , " Andras says . " You don ' t want to fall into a mental cocoon. " // The thought of going through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who dance across the ice with all the energy of butterflies flittering across a sunlit meadow. // //
