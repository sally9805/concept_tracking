Alfred Hitchcock : 1899-1980 <P> There were , at the minimum , two Alfred Hitchcocks . The " master of suspense " was pleased to be generally understood simply as a creator of elegant entertainments that stylishly , wittily induced the only anxiety attacks that a citizen of the Age of Anxiety could actually anticipate with pleasure . This image the rotund , British-born director shaped and nurtured almost as fussily as he did his films . In interviews he invariably doled out the same handful of childhood anecdotes and adult insights into himself , all reinforcing the notion of a person trying gamely to joke away a set of obsessions so common that anyone could identify with them ? fear of heights , of closed spaces , of open spaces and , above all , of false accusation and/or arrest . Television , when he began appearing as host of a series of funny-scary stories that he supervised ( but rarely directed ) , allowed him to burnish his public persona to a high gloss : the solemn-faced fat man with a stately pace and a sepulchral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tales he told . <P> It was delicious , this role playing . Especially in its duplicity . For if TV reinforced both Hitchcock 's wealth and his fame , making him the only director whose name above the title was more important than that of almost any star he could hire , it also did much more . The essentially false characterization of himself that he projected served to protect the privacy of a quiet , compulsively orderly man who was , in many of his attitudes , especially when he got to musing about sex , virtually an arrested adolescent . It also camouflaged facts that Hitchcock judged inimical to commercial success : that he took himself seriously as an artist , and that almost all of his work addressed itself , metaphorically , to the most sober existential questions . To use a clich ? ppropriate to a man of his girth , he was determined to eat his cake and have it too . <P> Mostly , he did , though the Motion Picture Academy , which likes to give its awards to people who trumpet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five times as best director . The only Oscar he got was a career-end special . Even after his death last week at 80 in his Bel-Air home , there were implacably middlebrow critics insisting that Hitchcock never placed his impeccably subtle technique in the service of " serious " matters . As if his lifelong contemplation of the way disorder violently intrudes upon the blithe assumptions of ordinary men that the world is a logical place were not a serious theme ( see Kafka ) . Or that his insistence on the omnipresence of evil , even in the most commonplace settings , did not square with the basic drift of thoughtful philosophers ( see Hannah Arendt ) . Or that the decline of the traditional moral order , supported by society 's most basic institutions , did not throw everyone ? not just Hitchcock 's heroes , who were so often forced to run both from cops and crooks ? back on their own desperate resources ( see Camus or , on any of these points , yesterday 's headlines ) .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
