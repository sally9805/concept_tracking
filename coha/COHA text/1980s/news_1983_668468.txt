If you ' re one of the roughly 1 million investors shelling out an average $150 a year - ( or a total of close to $500 million annually ) - for one or more of those market newsletters with supposedly sure- fire , can ' t-miss money-making advice , chances are you ' re throwing your money away . The reason : The majority of the newsletters - nearly 60 percent , would you believe - were for the birds in the first quarter of 1983 . And that ' s on top of shabby results both in 1981 and 1982 . A just-released weekend study of the first-quarter performances of 83 investment portfolios - as put out by 50 of the leading market newsletters - finds that 49 of the portfolios ( or 59 percent ) underperformed the general market . Moreover , 15 portfolios ( or 18 percent ) actually lost money in the quarter . This dismal performance , as detailed by the Hulbert Financial Digest of Washingtin , is one of the worst showings on the part of the newsletter fraternity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . In 1981 , only slightly over half of the 44 portfolios tracked by Hulbert - 23 to be precise - were up on the year . And in 1982 , about half of the 47 portfolios trailed the general market . Clearly , the latest quarterly showing by the newsletter brigade tells us that investment advisers are having a tough time adjusting to an increasingly selective bull market . Even more important , though , is the wisdom of sticking with a newsletter that ' s a bummer . First , though , to the hot hands in early 1983 . And the leader , I was surprised to learn , has only 75 subscribers . It ' s The Prudent Speculator of Santa Monica , Calif . Published 17 times a year - the annual price is $75 - the letter racked up an impressive gain of 29.6 percent , nearly triple the 10.3 percent first-quarter advance registered by the Wilshire 5000 Equity Index . How come so few subscribers ? Alfred Frank , the soft-spoken , 56- year-old publisher of the six-year-old letter , explains : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t push . . .. " Frank , who also manages about $6 million ( of which $160,000 is his own money ) , clearly travels a conservative investment path - almost a dying strategy , you might say . The average period for his stock selections runs three to four years . " We look for undervalued stocks , namely ones that have low price- earnings multiples and sell below book value , and our goal is long- term capital gains , " Frank says . Obviously , the man must be doing something right . His stock selections , he tells me , have led to an up each year since he started . And taking all six years together , The Prudent Speculator ' s portfolio - from March 3 , 1977 , through March 31 , 1983 - is up 134.6 percent . This is way above the gains registered in the same period by the Dow Jones industrial average ( 19.2 percent ) and the New York Composite Index ( 60.9 percent ) Frank ' s current favorites : Global Marine , Forest City Enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBD Bancorp ( the largest bank holding company in Michigan ) and Zapata . Rounding out the five top investment-letter performers in the first quarter are The Addison Report ( up 24.2 percent ) , The Chartist ( 21.4 percent ) , New Issues ( 21.8 percent ) and Green ' s Commodity Market Comments ( 20.9 percent ) . The newsletter Smart Money , turned out to be dumb money in early 1983 as it turned in the single worst performance - a wicked decline of 23.6 percent . A bet on lower stock prices - notably put options on Merril Lynch and Eastman Kodak - caused the letter ' s big drop . The Holt Investment Advisory , chiefly reflecting a 10 percent investment position inputs since last October , was the quarter ' s second biggest loser with a 19.6 percent decline . Joe " I ' m the Greatest " Granville , publisher of the Granville Market Letter , recently fired off a warning to subscribers to flee for cover . Actually , they would have been a lot better off if they were to flee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers last year with a stinging stock selection loss of nearly 26 percent - continues his losing ways . He ' s off 9.2 percent so far this year because of his continuing sentiment which calls for a 1983 drop in the Dow to 450 . The Financial Survival Report , the brainchild of investment advisor Howard Ruff , used to be called Ruff Times . That old name would sure be apropos now - with Ruff , largely because of bum advice on gold and silver , giving his subscribers a real rough time with an 8.9 percent loss in the quarter . Myers Finance &; Energy rounds out the five worst performers with a 4 percent loss in the quarter . The problem : a big silver position that went sour .
