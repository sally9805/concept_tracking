Writing under his own byline in the New York Times Magazine last week , President Reagan condemned organized crime as " this dark , evil enemy within . " He praised a commission he had appointed for exposing " the all too rarely discussed problem of those institutions and professionals  --  such as corrupt banks , unions or crooked lawyers  --  whose veneer of respectability helps make them the mainstays of organized crime . " <P> Two days later , the President 's commission turned around and bit its creator . The Commission on Organized Crime noted that the Reagan Administration had " contacts " with one corrupt union , the Teamsters , and its president , Jackie Presser . The report warned that such sociability with a tainted union " can lead to an erosion of public confidence and dampen the desire to end racketeering . " <P> The commission , headed by Federal Judge Irving R. Kaufman , charged that mobsters are " increasingly using labor unions as a tool to obtain monopoly power in some industries . " It said the Teamsters , the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Union and the Laborers ' International Union are all " substantially influenced and/or controlled by organized crime . " <P> Although Teamsters President Presser was the target of a federal strike force that wanted to charge him with embezzling funds from his Cleveland local , the Justice Department last year decided not to prosecute . A federal grand jury is now probing the reasons for this decision . One reported explanation was that Presser had been used by the FBI as an informant on Mob activities . <P> The Teamsters was one of the few unions to support Reagan in the 1980 election . After Reagan won , Presser was made a consultant on union matters to the President-elect 's transition team . He was a guest at the White House in 1983 when he met with Ed Meese , then a Reagan aide and now the Attorney General . After the 1984 election , Reagan and Meese visited Presser to thank him for his support . <P> Asked about the report , Meese replied that any meetings with labor leaders were " not designed or intended to interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration 's intent was not the issue . Meese might also have replied that such improprieties have not been confined to the Reagan Administration . The commission pointed out that some New York officials had been character witnesses for Anthony Scotto , a vice president of the Longshoremen 's Union , before he was convicted in 1979 of racketeering . The commission 's counsel noted that Jimmy Carter had even campaigned with Scotto in 1976.
