The development is a potential turning point in a lengthy struggle over access to the records , considered by experts to be the nation ' s most detailed raw data about the long-term effects of radiation exposure on human health. // The data have been sought by a variety of organizations for almost a decade , most recently by a Pennsylvania group made up of both scientists and laymen. // The information is at the center of a growing international scientific debate . Scientists outside the Government have been closely following the struggle between the Energy Department and the Pennsylvania group , the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund , contending that if the records are released to the fund ' s chief researcher , Dr. Alice M. Stewart , a prominent British epidemiologist , they could yield clues about radiation risks that have never before been made public. // Researchers under contract to the Energy Department have published hundreds of studies based on the records , but independent researchers , without access to them , have been unable to form their own interpretations. // The events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund first approached department officials about the possibility of gaining access to the records . Seven months later , the organization filed a formal request for them under the Freedom of Information Act. // In response to that request , department officials early today signed and prepared for mailing a letter that denied it . But late this afternoon , after an inquiry about the issue from The New York Times , higher officials of the department stopped the mailing. // C. Anson Franklin , the Energy Department ' s chief spokesman , said the department would review the letter and left open the possibility that it might still be sent. // Mr. Franklin said that in acquiring death records from the states of the workers involved , the Government had assured those states that their privacy regulations would be honored and that the records would therefore not be disclosed except to researchers under contract with the department . The death records are considered a particularly important part of the data , and Mr. Franklin said the agreements with the states appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> A Proprietary Interest // Beyond this consideration , Mr. Franklin said , some Energy Department officials regard all the information as proprietary , inasmuch as the Government has spent some $42 million over the last quarter-century to collect it and have it studied by researchers under contract. // In explaining the decision to review this approach , Mr. Franklin said action on Freedom of Information requests was generally handled at a level below the top of the department . As a result , the Deputy Energy Secretary , Joseph F. Salgado , learned of the Pennsylvania group ' s request , and the response to it , only today , following The Times ' s inquiry. // It was at that point that the mailing was halted , and Mr. Franklin , while saying the request might still be denied , laid equal stress on the possibility that the policy that led to the denial might be overturned . The decision to at least review the policy came against a backdrop of a mounting number of recent published reports that have documented severe safety problems throughout the network of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Pennsylvanians ' Response // The Three Mile Island Public Health Fund has been active in similar issues for some time . In 1981 , it filed a Federal suit against the operator and the insurers of Three Mile Island , a civilian nuclear power plant , over the accident that occurred there in March 1979 . In a settlement of that suit , the group received $5 million to study risks from exposure to levels of radiation such as those released at Three Mile Island. // In response to the developments at the Energy Department today , the group said it was prepared to go to court again , perhaps as early as next month , if the department ' s decision was ultimately unfavorable. // Jonathan Berger , the group ' s executive secretary , said that obtaining permission from states to share the death records was not likely to be so difficult as Mr. Franklin suggested. // Mr. Berger also said that since late 1986 , when the group first approached the Energy Department , officials there had posed a series of problems that they said needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them simple procedural matters . The dispute over the death records is just the latest , he said. // " This is a moving target , " said Mr. Berger . " I suspect if we go through the exercise of gaining permission from the states to share the data , the Energy Department would change their position again . The point is they are unwilling to let this data be released for independent analysis . They are bound and determined to keep that data inside the Energy Department ' s system . " <> <> Stored at Three Sites // The 300 , 000 workers who have been exposed to radiation , and whose records are therefore at issue , amount to about half the total number of men and women who have been employed at one time or another at American nuclear weapon plants since 1942 , when the Government undertook the building of the nation ' s first atomic bomb. // In addition to the death records , the data consist of documents on the 300 , 000 workers ' exposure to radiation , on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the information can be used to track how much radiation any worker received , what happened to him as a result , and when and how he died. // The voluminous information is stored by computer and in files at three principal sites within the weapon production network : at the Hanford Reservation in Richland , Wash. ; at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , and at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee . <> <> The Government ' s Studies // In recent months , an increasing number of reports published by scientists under contract to the department have indicated that weapon plant workers may be developing unusually high rates of cancers known to be related to radiation. // Earlier this month , for example , researchers at the Oak Ridge Associated Universities , a consortium of 49 colleges and universities under contract with the Energy Department , found that of 1 , 274 male workers at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina who were hired before 1955 and who worked there 5 to 15 years , 6 had died of leukemia , a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study ' s chief investigator , Dr. Donna L. Cragle , said further investigations had been undertaken to determine whether these deaths were in any way related to the workers ' exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals. // Still , officials of the nuclear weapon industry have argued for years that the best evidence to prove that radiation is less harmful than commonly believed is contained in research based on this same wealth of data on American atomic workers. // Perhaps the most convincing evidence , say some researchers , is contained in another study by the Oak Ridge Associated Universities . Since 1979 , Oak Ridge epidemiologists have identified 3 , 000 people who worked at 40 atomic weapon laboratories and production sites and who were exposed to radiation levels that exceeded the Federal safety standard. // The results , according to Dr. Shirley A. Fry , director of the Center for Epidemiologic Research at Oak Ridge , show that atomic workers who received the highest radiation exposures and would therefore be expected to develop cancers caused by radiation had not been affected . " There were no leukemias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We found no increase in any type of cancer linked to radiation , such as cancer of the lung or cancer of the thyroid . We found a very healthy population. " // Yet along with evidence the Government considers favorable are results that are more worrisome , as in the Savannah River study. // At the Rocky Flats Plant near Boulder , Colo. , which manufactures plutonium parts for nuclear weapons , epidemiologists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory analyzed the deaths from 1952 to 1979 of 5 , 413 white male employees and identified 13 men who had died of brain tumors , twice as many as would be expected in a similarly sized group of men in the general populace. //
