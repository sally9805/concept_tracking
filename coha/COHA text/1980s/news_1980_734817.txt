txt UPSTAIRS , IN THE press conference room by her fifth-floor office , Mayor Byrne is holding a press conference . She is talking about the 1981 city budget . She is talking about politics . And she is talking about her car and hout neither it nor she ever stayed overnight " anywhere except at my father 's house until the day I got married . " It seems a rather unusual subject to be the focus of a press conference held by the mayor of the second largest city in the United States . Downstairs , in the city council chambers on the second floor of City Hall , aldermen are also talking , as they are wont to do . THEY ARE TALKING to department heads at hearings on the 1981 budget of $1.6 billion . They are talking into each other 's ears as they go through the ritual handshakes . And they are talking ' about the mayor . They are not talking about her car nor where it spent nights before she married Jay a few years ago . ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are being critical instead of rolling over and purring . They are actually questioning a city budget , and the questioners a  --  e not just the independent aldermenThereare whispers of mutiny over the bounty . WHAT IS HAPPENING Monday in City Hall , upstairs and downstairs , is another chapter in our civic soap opera . The mayor , angry once again at the press , is criticizing coliannist Iry Kupcinet of the Chicago Sun-Times for writing that she had received all-night parking tickets near 's apartment . She is saying such charges would never be made if " the office of the mayor were not occupied by a woman. , " She is saying the whole subject is " very degrading to the office of the mayor . " The subject , however , does draw attention away from the budget . ISTANY OBSERVERS have praised the mayor 's handling of the city 's fiscal problems . They also have praised the ' new budget , saying it is open and informative . They like the prospect of the city not having a deficit and presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of these observers work for large corporations and live in Winnetka . The aldermen live in Chicago 's wards . The people in those wards do n't want the city to go broke any more than the bankers- on La Salle Street do . " But they do n't want to go broke themselves , either . ? They are calling my office and objecting , " says Ald. Edward Burke 14th . " It 's the first time I can , recall we 've had any kind of real objections . " Everything is hitting them at once  --  the water rates , ' the sewer rates , another property tax hike , the school board , utility rates . They are very disturbed . " THE MAYOR 'S accomplishments arebeing masked by , the inexperience of her advisers and department heads . Some  --  are very ' good . ' Some are only dealing with dollars and cents . " We are not a private enterprise . We are a government , and political considerations must weigh heavily . There is no better way to lose support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the ex- ample of Gov . Richard Ogilvie . He did a very credible job , but all his accomplishments were forgotten when he ran for re-election because he was labeled with the state income tax . " With a budget , there are legal considerations , political considerations , and dollars and cents . They all must be weighed . " THE ALDERMEN are weighing what , if anything , they can do to ease the pain of the budget 's demands on Chicago taxpayers . Burke is eyeing a new Office of Municipal Investigations , which is supposed to spend more than $3 million to catch naughty city workers . " It does n't need 35 trained police officers , " Burke says . " And it seems strange when you only have 55 personnel assigned to nacelles and you have 96 in an office to chase firemen 's residency cases . " Ald. Roman Pucinski 41st says . " There is no question people out there are mad . " " They are especially irate over the higher water rates and over higher salaries for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are going to try to offer some alternative to the water-sewer formula , " he says . Ald. Makin Oberman 43d has been a persistent critic of past city budgets , which he said were practically secret documents stuffed with waste . HE SEES MUCH the same waste in this budget , waste such as the four-man garbage crews beloved by Chicago politicians as a prime source of patronage . He also sees those taxes that pay for the crews . " There is no question they had to be increased , " he says . " But they have been increasing too fast . " He says that since the mayor came into office , taxes from various sources have increased by more than $300 million . " The political motivation is clear , " he says . " You overtax in the first and second year . Then in November of 1982 , you can say that because of ' our great fiscal management , ' there will be no increase ; there might even be a decrease . " That , of course , would be shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their show up for renewal in the 1983 city elections .
