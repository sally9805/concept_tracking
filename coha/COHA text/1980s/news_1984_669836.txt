Speculators can add . Yesterday , they put their pencils to work on Cooper Laboratories , the improbably complicated health-care concern that has been selling off parts of itself in the past 15 months in a calculated drive to push its share price up . This serial selling , especially last week ' s announcement of a $188. 5 million sale of Cooper ' s toothbrush division , has enabled investors to place readily calculable values on company assets . The result : a two-week , 60% gain in Cooper ' s shares , which closed yesterday at 16 1/2 , up 1/2 in heavy trading . Cooper Laboratories ( stock symbol : COO ) last year spun off 100% of its interest in CooperVision ( stock symbol : EYE ) and 15. 5% of its interest in Cooper Biomedical ( stock symbol : BUGS ) . Yesterday , EYE was sharp , closing up 2 1/4 at 15 7/8 . Since the same folks , especially Cooper Labs ' chairman , Parker Montgomery , exert influence over all three Coopers , traders were reasoning that CooperVision also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ready British buyer for the contact-lens and eye-care concern . Further fanning the buying ardor recently have been rumors that Mr. Montgomery , a perennial malcontent about his stocks ' prices , has been pursuing a tax ruling that would allow him to liquidate Cooper Laboratories and pass around the proceeds to holders  --  without a slice for the Internal Revenue Service . Although Mr. Montgomery was traveling yesterday and couldn ' t be reached , Joseph Dornig , Cooper Labs ' investor relations officer , said that " we just can ' t respond " to the liquidation rumors . But a quick look ( analysts yesterday were taking a long look ) at Cooper Labs ' assets suggests that there may be something in it for holders if there ' s something solid in all the liquidation talk . And if the liquidation evaporates , these assets at least provide holders with some risk protection . To start , the $188. 5 million sale to Gillette last week will put the equivalent of $11. 45 a share in Cooper Labs ' coffers . Cooper Labs ' 84. 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share . Together with cash on the books at Jan. 31 , Cooper then would have liquid assets of $16. 90 a share after the sale , higher than its closing price in the market yesterday . It isn ' t that easy , of course . Debt on the books has to be subtracted , and calculating the value of Cooper ' s remaining operations in lasers and health care is more complicated . But Alan Gaines , a New York money manager who has been buying Cooper Labs and CooperVision , puts the values of the company at $25 a share . Lawrence Haimovitch , an analyst at San Francisco-based Woodman , Kirkpatrick &; Gilbreath , says a conservative figure might be in " the low 20s . " Mr. Haimovitch says his contacts with Mr. Montgomery convince him that " he ' ll sell anything . " But he notes that there ' s a potential accounting snag in a sale of CooperVision . Because the company hasn ' t been freestanding for more than two years , Mr. Haimovitch says that accounting standards would force an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would require long-term annual writedowns of the amount of purchase that exceeded book value . Nonetheless , he likes CooperVision for purchase , figuring it will make $1. 30 a share in the year ending Oct. 31 , up from $1 a year earlier . James Mellon , a portfolio manager for GT Capital Management , the big British mutual fund concern , is confident that " a liquidation plan will be announced fairly soon . " He wouldn ' t say why he ' s confident , and in the absence of such elaboration there are at least two ways to take his statement . As the largest institutional holder of both CooperVision ( 1. 9 million shares ) and Cooper Labs ( 1. 2 million shares ) , Mr. Mellon has an interest in seeing their share prices rise . On the other hand , his closeness to the situation may give him insight . Mr. Mellon says Mr. Montgomery feels that " CooperVision is particularly undervalued , " with after-tax profit margin of about 10% , an established position in the soft-lens business and a 50% earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CooperVision is slipping in the market-share sweepstakes against Bausch &; Lomb , but CooperVision has a new soft lens , Permaflex , which it showed to salesmen yesterday . Both Mr. Mellon and Mr. Haimovitch believe the lens is a low-cost entry that is more comfortable than others on the market . Mr. Mellon says that he sold about 400 , 000 shares of his Cooper Labs holding lately , but that this shouldn ' t be taken as a criticism of the stock . " I still have 1. 2 million , and when you ' re this big , you have to sell on strength. "
