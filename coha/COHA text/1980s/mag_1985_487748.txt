erger Mania " is one of those recurring headlines summoned by editors from their corporate unconscious every so often to exorcise their doubts about the efficiency and benevolence of the American economy . In recent years the doubts have been mounting and the summonses served with increasing frequency . There have been more than 3,000 corporate mergers and acquisitions this year , almost twice as many as there were in 1980 . And their dollar value is grow-ing , too : this year 's batch is expected to top last year 's record $125 billion . But as much as editorialists , small-business enthusiasts and a few liberal economists may decry the trend , there is not much political passion in the country for antitrust regulation or fiscal sanctions against mergers . As a former Federal Trade Commission administrator said , " This is what happens when the free-market theory of the Chicago School meets the policy of greed of the Reagan Administration . " In an important way , Reagan has fueled the headlong rush to corporate concentration . This month 's merger of General Electric and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less at RCA 's invitation ( to avoid a hostile takeover by less generous raiders ) , G.E . plunked down $6.28 billion in cash . to buy the entertainment and electronics giant , the ninth-largest industrial corporation on the Fortune 500 . And where did G.E . get all that green ? Well , partly from us taxpayers , in the form of breaks written into Reagan 's tax reduction program passed with bipartisan support in 1981 . In the 1970s , G.E . was paying taxes at the going rate for corporations of about 35 percent . But from 1981 through 1983 it payed no taxes at all and actually got a $283 million refund . In 1984 , G.E . payed a piddling $185 million in taxes , thank you very much . But over those four years it reported profits of $9.5 billion . In other words , its four-year tax rate was just a hair more than 1 percent , not counting its 3 percent rebate . The rationale for this extravagant corporate welfare program was that it would encourage investment in industrial " plant " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American economy so fervently desired by economists of all ideological camps . But that 's not what happened . Big corporations , like G.E. , have used their tax windfalls to buy other big corporations , like RCA , with no attendant benefits for consumers , workers or the industrial infrastructure . In fact , there are likely to be more social deficits than profits from the mergers . The history of takeovers in the ' past two decades shows that many of the bloated businesses grow weaker with size . Hungry executives loot the rich sectors of their empire and neglect the poor ones . Corporate bureaucrats spend so much time playing Monopoly that they tend to forget the products they make , the services they perform and the needs they are supposed to fulfill . The motive force of their efforts is the imperial imperative , the urge to get bigger , and they accomplish that not by getting better but by buying one another out . So who benefits ? Forget about the hundreds of thousands of workers in G.E . and RCA plants and offices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at the top of their corporate pyramids huddled secretly for six days and emerged with the deal all signed and sealed . Now the workers and their communities are vulnerable to all the acts of mischief traditionally perpetrated by monopolies on vassals in their domain : summary plant closings , sudden divestitures , capital flights , unionbusting . Forget about the consumers , who now have less leverage to affect decisions about quality , price and choice in a constricted marketplace . Forget about Federal purchasing policy , which will be determined by the demands of monopolies rather than the needs of government agencies . In the huge military sector alone G.E./RCA will be so big that , as with General Dynamics , no one will dare deny it a contract  --  or cancel one because of poor performance or malfeasance . The only winners are the men at the top , with their golden parachutes , bonuses , stock options and other expensive trinkets built into the merger , game . The lawyers and brokers who arrange the deals do well , too , as do stock speculators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market of the last year is in some part fed by merger mania . When pressed , the corporate managers will say that concentration will help American industry to compete in the global marketplace , but they never say how . Compete against whom ? The Russians are in a different league , and the Europeans do not play as one team against the world , so that leaves the Japanese . But Japan 's economy is miles more competitive than America 's is becoming , and doing very well because of the competition . There are eleven major Japanese automobile manufacturers , for instance , for an internal market less than half the size of America 's . No matter what they say , the lords of merger are not interested in competition of any kind , foreign or domestic , but in control and in the profits that accrue from domination . Bush-wacked A t a time when leading Democrats crumple before the mere image of Ronald Reagan and look only rightward for new policies , it is a small relief to find even more cravenness among the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak knees the other night at a dinner party in Washington when he praised the late , contemptible William Loeb , the New Hampshire newspaper publisher , as " a fighter for those very things that bring all of us here tonight . " Now , it 's painfully clear what brought Bush there that night in the role of lickspittle : ambition for 1988 . So he was ready to try to exorcise the specter of wimpdom and " moderation " haunting his candidacy  --  anything to improve his chances in the New Hampshire primary election . The risk was that he would n't fool the ravenous right-wingers with this conversion but simply strengthen their view that he 's a gutless wonder not to be counted , on in their radical crusade . After all , his audience knew that Loeb , the eccentric , ? reactionary mudslinger , had called Bush " unfit " for the nomination in 1980 and a " spoiled little rich kid . " Of course , that was also the year when Bush , not yet enlightened , attacked Reagan for his " voodoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst newspaper publisher of his generation might have recalled that Loeb also labeled Eisenhower a " stinking hypocrite " and Gerald Ford " Jerry the Jerk , " and once headlined an article " Kissinger the Kike . " He saw Kissinger then as " a tool of the Communist conspiracy , " which gives some flavor of the man Bush was praising . It is getting harder for the spellbound Democrats to accommodate themselves to the peculiarities of Reagan II , as their restless thrashing about in the deficit reduction and tax reform debates have shown . They still have no coherent policies for the future , nor the courage to stick to the New Deal tradition . But as the scramble for succession begins , the cracks are appearing in the Republican icons . A few more grisly comedies like the genuflection of George Bush might actually give the Democrats the nerve to stand for something decent . The Unesco Walk A year after giving notice of its intent to withdraw from Unesco , Britain has gone ahead and done the dirty deed . Its decision , announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embattled institution . On a symbolic level , Britain 's withdrawal removes a founding member of Unesco , one whose intellectuals played a key role in getting the organization started in the dark aftermath of World War II . More immediately , Britain 's decision magnifies the impact of the U.S. withdrawal a year earlier . Now that Britain has exited , it is argued that the American move can no longer be dismissed as an isolated fit of pique . Such an analysis , however , is not completely accurate . It was not so much Britain that decided to withdraw from Unesco as it was Margaret Thatcher . Even for someone known for marching to a different drummer , Thatcher was remarkably isolated on this issue . The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons , a bipartisan body , unanimously recommended that Britain remain in the organization . During a five-hour debate in Commons , virtually every participant , Conservative and Labor , condemned the government 's decision . Thatcher 's own Foreign Minister , Geoffrey Howe , publicly argued that Britain should stay in Unesco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . France urged Britain to stay , and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl personally appealed to Thatcher to reconsider . In fact , the entire European Economic Community advised against a British withdrawal . So did every member of the Commonwealth . Such appeals reflected broad agreement that Unesco 's most recent general conference , held last month in Sofia , Bulgaria , had accepted many of the reforms sought by Britain and other Western nations . London 's chief complaints had been the familiar ones : Unesco was profligate , its bureaucracy top-heavy , its programs excessively " politicized . " As Britain desired , the general conference voted to absorb the 25 percent drop in funds caused by the U.S. pullout rather than require offsetting contributions from other members . It also rejected some controversial resolutions on communications issues and voted to renew the focus on Unesco 's original aims  --  education , science and culture  --  while retreating from politically contentious fields , likedisarmament . A confidential U.S. report on the proceedings obtained by the London Guardian said British delegates were " guardedly satisfied " with the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw . Critics had few doubts as to the reason why . British newspapers reported that Secretary of State George Shultz and Jean Gerard , the former U.S. delegate to Unesco , made their views known to British officials before the final decision was made . During the debate in Commons , members of both parties criticized the Thatcher government for abjectly capitulating to pressure from the Reagan Administration . One Member of Parliament was especially biting in describing Washington 's stance : " Those of us who know the United States intimately . . . know that it is passing through a time of intense and distasteful nationalism . It believes that it walks high and that the rest of the world has to do what it demands . It will get through that in time . It is an unpleasant reaction to the defeat in Vietnam . " That assessment came not from Neil Kinnock or Tony Benn or any other Labor leader , but from Edward Heath , the former Tory Prime Minister . His remarks indicate just how unilateral was Margaret Thatcher 's decision to leave Unesco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
