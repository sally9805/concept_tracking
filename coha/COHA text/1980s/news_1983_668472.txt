When the drivers aren ' t getting drunk and ramming buses into buildings , they ' re stabbing passengers or getting punched out . When the management , headquartered in a renovated bordello , isn ' t funneling millions of dollars into a commuter-rail system that no one seems to want , it ' s spending thousands more on slick ad campaigns to fortify its anemic image . And when commuters aren ' t ignoring the buses and using their cars , they ' re screaming for the heads of everyone connected with what many consider an inefficient , spendthrift and arrogant outfit . The target of all this scorn is the Regional Transportation District - the gang that can ' t drive straight . The RTD , created 14 years ago , has yet to fulfill its initial mission : Bring some kind of alternative mass transit - be it a monorail system or subway - to the six-county Denver metro area . Today , about 700 buses are still RTD ' s only means of transport . In the meantime , as Denver ' s transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become the laughingstock of public agencies . Bad timing , poor service and a public-be-damned attitude have forged that perception , so much so that one member of the district ' s new board said his primary goal is to " stop the public from thinking of us as a bunch of idiots . " Here ' s what he ' s talking about : - In 1978 , RTD began to build a 13-block pedestrian mall and headquarters downtown . The estimated cost of $45 million ballooned to $76 million by the time the project was completed last year . - During last summer ' s 27-day strike , downtown traffic flowed smoothly as 80,000 regular bus riders hitchhiked , carpooled , jogged or bicycled to their jobs . What angered them , however , was RTD ' s boast that it made $409,000 a week during the strike . The money came from a one-half percent sales tax , government subsidies and savings on gasoline and salaries . A month after the strike ended , the RTD board gave its executive director a $6500-a-year raise and $7000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 , an RTD driver stabbed a passenger after he asked for a transfer slip and then told the driver , " I hope you have a lousy day . " The driver , who was fired , was sentenced to a month in jail and four years ' probation . Since then , two other RTD drivers have been hit in the face in disputes over transfers . - Again in February 1982 , an RTD driver , later found to be drunk , seriously injured herself when she smashed her empty bus into a downtown apartment building . Indeed , during last Christmas Eve ' s blizzard , one exasperated driver told his busful of passengers , " On behalf of the staff and management of RTD , neither of which knows what it ' s doing , I ' d like to apologize for the miserable service you ' ve been getting . " - Last year , the Rocky Mountain News had to take RTD to court before the district released public documents dealing with safety matters , accident reports , mall construction , small accident claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released in RTD ' s in-house newsletter . Small wonder that a recent poll - which RTD spent $12,000 on and then kept secret for two months - showed the district to be the least popular agency in town , beating out the water , electric and telephone companies . Falling ridership has more tangibly driven home those findings . In 1982 , 6.5 million fewer passengers took The Ride - as the buses are known - than they did in 1981 . " The problem is that the old RTD board didn ' t have to respond to the taxpayers or any elected officials , " says Jack McCroskey , who , as a state legislator successfully fought to have the appointees replaced with a slate of publicly elected representatives . " They changed bus routes at will , held secret meetings and autocratically ran RTD as if it were a private business , while telling everyone else to go to hell . " RTD now must try to restore public confidence , to deal with rising costs , slumping ridership , dwindling federal aid , and to develop an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an expected population of 3 million by the year 2000 . It won ' t be easy . Most Denverites oppose any RTD-sponsored light- rail system . In 1980 , voters rejected a 1-percent increase in the sales tax , which would have funded a 77-mile , $5.8-billion system . Since then , RTD has spent $8 million to fund more studies and to buy rights-of-way for a system that may never be built . The district , which ended 1982 with $47 million in the bank , recently spent $60,000 on a television ad campaign that got more laughs than resultsfrom viewers . It featured a six-fingered hand pointing out from billboards reading , " RTD Wants You ! " " They ' ve done so many stupid things , " says McCroskey , now on RTD ' s board . " As long as we can ' t run the buses or keep letting everyone think we ' re clowns , no one will let us solve the problems 15 years down the road . We have to turn it around if we want RTD to play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
