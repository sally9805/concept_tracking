 | Thirteen years ago , when Beatrice Alda was in fourth grade , her dad volunteered to direct her in a show she 'd written for a class project . " I was ten and I had tried to create a satirical version of Cinderella starring ? who else ? me , " Beatrice recalled . " My fairy godmother was played by a boy with bright red hair ; my horse was another classmate , down on all fours . " Beatrice 's dark eyes flashed with laughter at the memory . " I was thrilled when my dad loved my show , " she said . " And when he came to class to direct it , everyone loved him . " All the kids already knew Dad because in Leonia , N.J. , where we lived , everyone knows everyone else . But they did n't know him as an actor because M*A*S*H had not started yet . He generated great excitement in our classroom simply because he was totally committed to our project . " Beatrice 's older sister , Elizabeth , remembers her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was 1979 , and Alan Alda had become a very big star indeed when Elizabeth joined him and her mother in New York for the opening of his film The Seduction of Joe Tynan . Afterward as they tried to get from the theater to their car , they were mobbed by a throng of " paparazzi " photographers . " I was standing close to my dad , " Elizabeth said , " when an overly aggressive photographer literally shoved me out of the way to get a clear shot of Dad . I was off balance and fell , twisting my ankle , whereupon my father flew into a rage such as I 'd never seen before . " If you ever come near us again , I 'll have the cops take you away ! ' he shouted at the photographer . At Dad 's insistence the man was removed from the scene , and then my father pushed through the crowd to get ice for my swelling ankle . I 'll never forget how outraged he was that anyone would dare hurt his family . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Elizabeth , 24 ; and Beatrice , 23 ? are more accustomed to the hazards of premieres . They are both launched on movie and TV careers . Alan 's eldest daughter , Eve , 25 , is a social worker in Boston . Elizabeth had prepared for an acting career since her college days . As a freshman at Kenyon College she worked on the costumes for a play that Kenyon alumnus Paul Newman returned to campus to direct , and by the end of her freshman year she was acting herself . " Dad helped me so much , " she recalled . " I remember one time going  | home on vacation with a scene from Inherit the Wind for my acting class . Dad worked on it with me , and as a result , the best performance I gave of that scene was in our dining room at home with him reading with me . " A few years later Liz made her movie debut playing her father 's daughter . Beth , in the picture The Four Seasons . Beatrice also wanted to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she too made her debut in The Four Seasons , playing Lisa . Beth 's best friend . Their dad wrote the movie parts with his daughters in mind , but he did n't tell them about it at first . " He just asked me to read the script , " Bea said . " Then he asked , ' What do you think of it ' ? ' I told him I loved it ! Then he said , kind of casually , ' How would you like to play Lisa ? ' I could n't believe it ! " Both girls continued in their roles when The Four Seasons became a TV series . The Alda sisters neither look nor act like typical Hollywood children . Perhaps that 's because they grew up quite differently than most stars ' offspring . Before his success in M*A*S*H , Alan and Arlene Alda lived in a rather ordinary white wood house on a street filled with kids in Leonia. one-square-mile town , population 9,000 . After M*A*S*H , they decided to stay in Leonia rather than pull up rootand move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlene had been a clarinetist with the Houston Symphony and Alan was in the Army , stationed in Houston , when a mutual friend introduced them . " Later , when Dad got transferred away from Houston , he flew back and forth to see Mom , " said Bea . " After they married and moved East , Mom gave up her orchestra job but played regularly with chamber-music groups in New York . Later , after we children came along , she took up photography and has been very successful at it : she 's had six books published . " Many youngsters might have been upset at being denied the chance to move to Hollywood with their famous father . The Alda girls maintain they had the opposite reaction . " It 's very special to live in a small town , " Bea said . " Our family knew all the other families there . " " Yes , it was really comfortable , " Liz agreed . " We felt together and safe . I remember on Sunday mornings there was always music at our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber-music groups And she and Dad always cooked together . In fact , the only time I ever heard them quarrel was over who put what pots where . " " We had no help at home ? we were the help , " said Bea . " All the neighborhood kids played together on the front steps or on the street . In summer the ice-cream man came by . We moved once ? three blocks away to a slightly larger house where Liz and I shared the third level . " When I was in the eighth grade , we both transferred to a school in a nearby . town , a three-mile drive away . Our parents took turns chauffeuring us to school until Liz was old enough to get her driver 's license . Our parents gave us a lot of freedom because they always trusted us , and in a small town it 's easier to be free . " " I 'm grateful that Dad did n't move us to the West Coast , " said Elizabeth " Our values would have been different if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people involved in movies : we 'd have been an actor 's daughters . Dad and Mom would probably have kept their perspective in that environment , but it would have been harder for us . " I was 13 when M*A*S*H started , " Liz went on . " My sisters and I were in school and busy with our own activities . Being sensitive to that , Dad felt he did n't want to change the fabric of our lives ? especially since at first he did n't know how long the show would last . He made a very wise decision , from our point of view . " Dad knew that back in our little town we were being exposed to many kinds of people in many different occupations ? not just moviemaking . And , being right over the George Washington Bridge from New York City , we had the stimulation of going to the theater , ballet , operas , and concerts . We had the best of several worlds . " What his daughters took for granted at one time made Alan Alda an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in M*A*S*H , he commuted . He worked in Hollywood , but he lived with his family back east in Leonia , N.J. " He came home every weekend , " Elizabeth emphasized . " Even though the commuting must have been difficult , I think his coming home for the weekends allowed him to keep his sanity , " said Beatrice . " I  | know how lonely he must have been during the week . But every Friday night he caught the late plane from Los Angeles , and my mother would pick him up at the New York airport at 6:30 on Saturday morning . So when we 'd come down to breakfast , there he 'd be . Spending the weekends together , we 'd eat , read , see friends , go to ball games , and talk . Mostly talk . Then on Sunday evenings he 'd leave again for the West Coast . Poor Dad must have had permanent jet lag for all the years he was working on M*A*S*H , but it was worth it for all of us . He 'd leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being a regular family . " " The commuting was really a continuation of Dad 's spending time with us , " Liz broke in . " He 'd always spent time . Before M*A*S*H , when we were small , every Saturday he 'd take one of us on an outing anywhere we wanted to go . Each week was someone 's turn . On my Saturdays I always opted for the amusement park . Dad would n't let me go on the roller coaster there , but we did go on the spider ride and play games in the arcade . Unfortunately for Dad , Bea and Eve liked the amusement park as much as I did , so he landed up going there almost every Saturday . A s you can see , he is a very patient man . But he can also get exasperated . I remember one time when Bea was seven and I was eight and we 'd done something that bothered him . All of a sudden , he got really angry . He did n't yell at us , he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess he felt he was n't really getting the point across because he finally looked at us and exclaimed , You know , you make me acrimonious ! ' Of course , we 'd never heard the word before , so we just giggled and thought it was very funny . " Said Bea , " Just recently Dad reminded me of a time when Mom was in India on a photographic assignment and he was on hiatus from M*A*S*H and stayed home for a solid month with us . We were in high school at the time , and when we 'd come home in the evening , he 'd have dinner ready for us . One night he made this great dish ? moussaka ? a Greek specialty with eggplant , one of Dad 's favorite foods . It 's quite a complicated recipe , and he spent a long time preparing it . But when we came home and he proudly brought the moussaka to the table , we took one look and  | greeted it with , " Yuck , what is that ? ' and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love it ! " I n line with their togetherness another Alda priority has been traveling as a family , and over the years they have visited England , Ireland , France , and Italy . Liz said , " I always learn more traveling with our parents than I would on my own because they do so much homework for our trips . They even find out about little castles that have been converted to inns , and we stay there instead of in big hotels . " Of course , the family always celebrated holidays together , even if they had to travel thousands of miles to do so . " Thanksgiving we spent with Dad 's parents ( actor Robert Alda ) on the West Coast , " said Liz . " At Passover we were with my mother 's family on the East Coast , and during our summer holidays we 'd be off to California to be with Dad . " And for the last 10 years the Alda family has gathered to spend the Christmas holidays in the Virgin Islands . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no television , no air conditioning . We play a lot of tennis ? my dad is an intense player . So am I. And we swim , sail , and do all the water sports . " However , despite their general togetherness , when each of his daughters graduated college , Alan took her on a trip of her choice , just the two of them alone . Upon graduating Connecticut College , he and Eve visited the Greek Islands . When Liz finished Kenyon College , she chose a tour of Italy . France , and Austria , with stops at Salzburg and Vienna . Bea is the only one who has n't taken her trip as yet . At the time she graduated from Wesleyan . work was due to start on The Four Seasons TV series in which she and Liz had parts . But she has n't forgotten about her trip . " First Dad and I were going to go to China , " she said . " Then Dad thought  | up an African safari . Lately I 've been thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you serious ? I 'll go anywhere . ' " Bea knows he will . No matter how busy he is , he 'll find the time . He always has . He has never isolated himself from them because of his career . " I first remember Dad working on Broadway in a show called The Apple Tree , " Liz said . " He used to bring us to the theater and the three of us took turns sitting in the orchestra pit with the conductor , watching him up on the stage . " " I could never believe it was Daddy up there , " Bea remembered . " He played three different characters in the show and wore different wigs and makeup for each , so that he did n't look like himself at all . His becoming ' famous ' never really occurred as far as we 're concerned . He has always been our dad , a man who loved to act and to write , long before he became famous . I remember the times when he 'd do a play or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That must have been very difficult for him because he has always impressed on us that one of the pitfalls of acting is that you ca n't count on it for any stability unless you 're at the very top . That 's the thing that has changed for Dad : He has achieved a certain stability . But he has n't changed . In the midst of maybe the busiest year of his life ? windup of M*A*S*H ; starting to produce , write , and direct The Four Seasons on TV ; and filming commercials ? he would go every day to see his father who had had a stroke , to work with him as part of his therapy . " " Then when Mom 's father became ill in New York and Mom wanted to take care of him , " said Liz , " we all dropped everything to go East with her . " Though today Dad 's a star , he 's managed to stay healthy , " Liz went on . " That 's at least in part because he has had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stabilizing force in our family . " S he 's also been a wonderful role model for me , " said Bea . " Thanks to her , I always just assumed that I would have a career because she was proof to all of us that a woman can have a family as well as a work life . She has done well at both , and Dad has always been totally with her . " " We 're so fortunate to have a family in which there 'll never be a divorce , " said Elizabeth . " Any problems my parents ever have , I know they 'll work out . It 's a joy just to share their atmosphere . " As though to exemplify the wondrous quality of her parents ' marriage . Bea remembered one of their recent wedding anniversaries that they celebrated in New Jersey . Alan surprised Arlene with a party . " But that was only the beginning , " said Bea . " A family friend who works for an international company was there and asked Mom . ' After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport ? I 've got to fly to Paris tonight . ' Of course , Mom said yes , so at the proper time Mom and Dad piled our friend 's luggage into the car and drove him to the airport . " When they got there , however , Dad turned to Mom and said , Arlene , he 's not going to Paris . You and I are going to Paris ! ' Of course , Mom went into shock . It was the last thing in the world she expected . With our help Dad had even packed her clothes in our friend 's luggage , so it really was a complete sur-prise ! " Beatrice laughed heartily at the memory of her father 's extravagant but loving prank . It seemed to typify her father to her . Once again , Elizabeth agreed . " Yes , " she said , " that 's our dad ? Alan Alda. "
