In 1906 San Francisco with its 400,000 souls was the undisputed gem of the Pacific Coast , a bustling , pungent , polyglot city enjoying corrupt government , splendid libraries and wonderful restaurants . As a hub of international finance and society , it rivaled New York City and Paris , and it took perverse pride in its reputation , well earned by the depravity of the carnal Barbary Coast , as " the wickedest city in the world . " The evening of April 17 , when the nonpareil Enrico Caruso sang in Carmen at the Grand Opera House before repairing to the fabulous Palace Hotel ( a telephone and bath for every room , no less ) , was simply the glittering usual . As the populace drifted to sleep that night , all was well . Who could have dreamed that in only a few hours little would remain of this luminous metropolis but some blackened hills and charred ruins by the Golden Gate ? <P> The devastation of San Francisco  --  and a calamity for Santa Rosa and San Jose and every other California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the first light of what would have been a lovely day . A dreadful howling sound shattered the dawn , as the earth suddenly rumbled , vibrated , heaved and pitched , wobbling in a demonic dance . " The whole street was undulating , " recalled police sergeant Jesse Cook . The quake shook the city , in words that became folklore , like a " terrier shaking a rat . " <P> In two distinct stages lasting a minute and five seconds , the quaking stunned the populace out of sleep into an incomprehensible terror of showering plaster , scattering bric-a-brac , breaking dishes , shifting furniture , toppling walls and collapsing roofs .

Many residents drowned , trapped , in deluges from ruptured water mains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale was devised later , experts rated the quake at a tremendously potent 8.3 . <P> The shuddering pandemonium abruptly ended in an uncanny stillness " almost as awesome as the dreadful sound of the quake , " William Bronson relates in The Earth Shook , the Sky Burned . Dazed men still in nightclothes stumbled out of dwellings along with women holding babies . The air was powdery . Many streets had gaping fissures . Few residents could get any idea of the extent of what had happened . People milled about , as an observer put it , " like speechless idiots . " Beyond view , the injured and trapped began to cry out , and gradually the able-bodied undertook rescues . <P> Many well-built structures survived with minor damage , but 90% of all buildings were of frame construction . Wooden dwellings in the congested area south of Market ( where most of the dead would be found ) were reduced to heaps of kindling , which were quickly set afire by overturned stoves . Scattered blazes began to burn at once . Yet the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
