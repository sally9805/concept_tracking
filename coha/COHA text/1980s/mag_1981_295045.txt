A coal strike looms <P> " Negotiations are meant to be a time of give and take . But the only thing I have seen from the industry 's negotiators is take , take , take . " United Mine Workers President Sam Church Jr . uttered that ringing denunciation after talks broke down in Washington last week between his union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association for a new three-year contract . A strike by 160,000 U.M.W. members is considered almost certain to take place when the current agreement expires this week . At the last negotiating session the union demanded wage and benefit increases over three years totaling 46% , while the operators offered only a 20% raise . Yet money is not the thorniest problem .

Coal-burning power plants in the U.S. have a 120-day stock pile , and the high-demand heating sea son is almost over . Mines covered by the union agreement now account for only 44% of coal produced in the U.S. , down from 70% a decade ago . Some 20,000 U.M.W. members have been laid off . Though both sides are prepared to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ugly mood that has marked previous strikes seems to be on the rise . Just the word of the breakdown in negotiations last week sparked wildcat strikes by 8,000 miners in the East and Midwest .
