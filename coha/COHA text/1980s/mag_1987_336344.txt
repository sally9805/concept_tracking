While the new wing of Louvain Prison near Brussels is hardly luxurious , its color television sets , recreation rooms and large cells with attached bathrooms make it a relatively comfortable place to await trial . But the situation of the 26 English soccer fans now housed there is anything but comfortable . After being extradited from Britain , they face manslaughter charges arising from riots during the 1985 European Cup championships in Brussels ' Heysel Stadium . Thirty-nine spectators died as they fled rabid English fans . Most of the victims were crushed to death . <P> The decision to put the suspects in Louvain outraged convicts at other Belgian prisons . Hundreds of inmates hurled stones and set fires at the overcrowded Forest and St. Gilles jails in Brussels . If convicted , the English fans could each be sentenced to ten years in prison .
