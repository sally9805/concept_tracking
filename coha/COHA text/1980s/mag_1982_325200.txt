Despite ballot-box appeal , the antinuke movement is worried <P> Millions of American voters may be surprised to discover on Nov. 2 that they are taking part in one of the largest national plebiscites since the repeal of Prohibition . The proposal that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should agree to a mutual freeze on nuclear weapons is on the ballot in nine states , the District of Columbia and such cities as Chicago , Philadelphia and Denver . Nearly a third of the electorate will have a chance to take a stand on the issue . <P> Polls show that the freeze proposals are expected to win in most statewide elections , sometimes handily . The most recent sampling for TIME by Yankelovich , Skelly &; White reveals that Americans support the freeze idea 76% to 19% . Opposition is poorly organized and has little funding . In many races , moreover , candidates of both parties support the freeze . But not even the freeze movement 's leaders claim that the issue is likely to affect many congressional races . <P> That is true even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outspoken .

John Dolinsky , a leader of Californians for a Strong America , one of the few groups fighting the freeze , complains that White House aides have told state party leaders to place first priority on getting their candidates elected and have warned that " an antifreeze position might hurt their chances . " <P> Few of the movement 's leaders are ebullient about their issue 's general popularity . " We are in something of a lull , " concedes Harold Willens , a wealthy Los Angeles businessman who is leading the campaign to approve the freeze referendum in California . One reason for the uneasiness in the movement is its very success . In less than two years it mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 700,000 supporters jammed New York 's Central Park in June . In August it failed by only two votes to be endorsed by the U.S. House of Representatives . But the excitement of those heady days is fading , and recent freeze rallies in Arkansas , Iowa , Tennessee and Washington , D.C. , have been disappointing . Asks David McCauley of the American Friends Service Committee in Vermont : " How do we keep the momentum ? "
