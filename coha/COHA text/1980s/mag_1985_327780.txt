The sun came out in Britain last week after five gloomy months , but it was not shining on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . First there had been local elections in early May in which her Conservatives took a severe drubbing from the Social Democratic/Liberal Alliance . Then came a dark cloud of budding insurrection from within the Tory party , and finally the thunderclap of a new Gallup poll that showed how far the Conservatives have fallen . For the first time since their slump preceding the Falklands war in 1982 , the Tories ranked third in a poll , trailing , at 30.5% , behind Labor 's 34% and the Alliance 's 33.5% . <P> Perhaps the most surprising development was a whiff of rebellion within the Conservative Party . An informal group calling itself Conservative Center Forward was launched by about 30 moderate Tory M.P.s , with former Foreign Secretary Francis Pym , 63 , as its leader . In calling for measures to ease unemployment and bolster industry through greater investment by the government in the public sector , Pym declared , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its political opponents . It stands in danger of being sunk by its own shells . " Though Pym praised the Prime Minister for her " courage and determination " and insisted that the new caucus would not be disloyal to the party and its leadership , his sharp criticism was hardly the view of a Thatcher partisan . <P> Downing Street 's reaction was one of carefully orchestrated scorn . A senior Thatcher aide dismissed Pym as a " rejected " minister making one last effort to achieve the party leadership . As for the C.C.F. , said the aide , it is " enormously long on criticism and extremely short on prescriptions , except to spend more money . " <P> But Thatcher supporters could hardly deny that the news , at least for the moment , was uniformly bad . In the county council balloting on May 2 , the Conservatives lost almost 200 seats in their worst showing in years . Jobs in the manufacturing sector fell by 11,000 last month , fueling criticism of the government 's austerity prescriptions even from a member of Thatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a contender to succeed Thatcher , advocated drastic action to combat the 13.5% unemployment rate . Until recently , Britain 's low inflation index had been one of the government 's points of pride ; last week the rate stood at 6.9% , up from 5.1% a year ago and the highest since 1982 . <P> Bad tidings also flowed from last week 's council elections in Northern Ireland . The Irish Republican Army 's political wing , Sinn Fein , which advocates terrorist tactics in bringing an end to British rule in the province , contested elections for the first time and made a strong showing by electing 59 of its candidates .
