Vital Interests <P> To the Editors : <P> Harsh facts and hard choices for Central America May 9 . More dollars , military advisers , covert activities . It is all so familiar . Is this what President Reagan calls our moral duty ? Our only obligation to that region is to send food and other essentials for economic growth . <P> Luella Pepin <P> Swanville , Minn . <P> <P> President Reagan delivered a stirring address on the menace in Central America . Unfortunately , the message did not penetrate congressional partisanship . In his rebuttal , Senator Christopher Dodd alluded to Reagan 's not " going with the tide of history . " The Senator prefers to forget Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , the East bloc countries and the surrogate Communist nations in our own hemisphere . <P> <P> Nicholas J. Romano <P> Colonel U.S.A.R. ( ret . ) <P> Sagaponack , N. Y. <P> <P> Senator Dodd was on target when he said that " if Central America were not racked with poverty , hunger and injustice , there would be no revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is agrarian reform , redistribution of wealth , and economic assistance . If Central America were economically stable , the Soviets would have nothing to exploit . <P> Victor L. Negron <P> Rio Piedras , P.R . <P> U.S. intervention in support of military regimes and ruling oligarchies is the problem , not the solution . <P> Sherman Hasbrouck <P> Orono , Me . <P> <P> When are the people of this country going to realize that we must stop the Communist threat in Latin America ? Are we going to wait until the guerrillas cross the Rio Grande before we do anything ? <P> Sharon Stephens <P> Sterling Heights , Mich . <P> <P> Reluctant Allies <P> The participants in TIME 's Atlantic Alliance conference May 9 talked about everything but the essential point . European and American interests in commerce , defense and high technology have become so deeply divided that nothing can bring them together again . Good relations will come only when the U.S. gets its troops out of Europe . America 's future lies in the Pacific basin , as is clear to anyone who travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediocre Education <P> Sad to say , the mediocrity found in our educational system May 9 reflects our culture . Instead , education should set the standards for a society . The reforms recommended by the National Commission on Excellence in Education can help youngsters who have the potential to be educated . However , the proposals can not compensate for role models that are lacking in the home . Education should follow its traditional function and resist social experimentation . <P> <P> Murray Howden <P> Allentown , Pa . <P> <P> This nation 's public schools have been given too much responsibility . We have asked them to teach the three Rs as well as counsel maladjusted teens , train the handicapped , advise unwed mothers , prevent drug abuse-and give instruction in computer programming . Greater efficiency , not longer hours , is the only way our schools can meet our increasing demands . <P> Bennett A. Rafoth <P> Athens , Ga .
