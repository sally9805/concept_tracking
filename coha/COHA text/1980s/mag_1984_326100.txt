THE KILLING FIELDS <P> Directed by Roland Joff ; Screenplay by Bruce Robinson <P> " This is n't a 1940s movie , " Sydney Schanberg ( Sam Waterston ) cries in one of the less deadly moments of frustration he suffers in The Killing Fields . One has to admire the honesty of a film that includes among its other acuities an intelligent capsule review of itself . For in recounting the tormented friendship of Schanberg , the New York Times correspondent who won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for his accounts of the fall of Cambodia , and his native assistant , Dith Pran ( Haing S. Ngor ) , the film does sacrifice the narrative coherence and the heroically moral resolutions old movies imposed on reality . Instead it offers the anguish decent men feel when they stand impotent before the high , harsh tides of history and the consequences of their own miscalculations . <P> The Killing Fields implies that Schanberg , when he began reporting from Southeast Asia , may have borrowed some of his reportorial manner from newspapering yarns . Brave , adversarial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , unaware of how brutal the Khmer Rouge is , he is the classically impatient American journalist , overriding his better instincts in order to get the story . Those include , in Waterston 's fine performance , the hint of a pervasive , unexamined melancholia that is far more common in life than it is in the movies . The picture leaves no doubt that if Schanberg had heeded the subtler side of his nature , his friend Pran would have been spared the almost inconceivable ordeal that preoccupies the second half of The Killing Fields . <P> Unable to bear the thought of life without his faithful interpreter and fixer ( the movie 's most suspenseful sequence shows Pran desperately negotiating for his employer 's life with rebels who have captured him ) , the reporter dismisses broad hints about what the fate of a Cambodian native who has served a Western employer might be if the Communists seize power . When he and some fellow journalists ( among them the good John Malkovich ) try to concoct a false passport the gesture is too little , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-education in the countryside , where millions died , while Schanberg , back home , pulls what distant wires he can to rescue him . <P> It is here that conventional narrative breaks down , the conventional desire for a grand heroic gesture defeated . The film 's ostensible protagonist is shuffled off to a few guilty scenes so that Pran 's patient , stubborn will to survive his awful ordeal may be celebrated . Ngor , a Cambodian doctor now living in California , brings both a natural gift and memories of his own torments by the Khmer Rouge to this role .
