" When I first went to the Baltimore Orioles in 1968 , they had pitchers like Jim Palmer , Dave McNally , Mike Cuellar and Pat Dobson . But , except for Palmer , for arm strength and natural talent , none of the Orioles could throw with these kids. " // For people who suspect that Bamberger ' s rhetoric is running away with his judgment , the manager of the Mets adds : " This is as good a group of kids as I ' ve seen in 37 years in baseball . These guys have the potential to become the Tom Seaver , Jerry Koosman and Nolan Ryan of the 1980 ' s. " // Frank Cashen , a restrained man who ran the Orioles for 10 years before becoming general manager of the Mets , says : " This is the best-looking group of young pitchers I ' ve ever had . " Lou Gorman , vice president of the Mets for baseball operations , who helped build the Orioles and Kansas City Royals into winners , says : " They remind you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I kept hearing about kids named George Brett , Willie Wilson , Dennis Leonard , Rich Gale , Doug Bird and Dan Quisenberry . They even remind you of the Oakland A ' s before that . They grew a bunch of rookies named Reggie Jackson , Sal Bando , Catfish Hunter , Blue Moon Odom and Joe Rudi. " // Are they kidding ? Spring may be the season of hope , but this sounds farfetched , even for a team that finished in last place in four of the last six years , and next to last in the two others . Now they say they ' re finding a generation of heroes in the bushes. // " Take the first time I saw Jeff Bittiger , " Gorman says , placing the focus on a 19-year-old New Jerseyan with the looks of a choir boy and a whirring fastball . " I went to Lynchburg , Va. , to scout players and saw Bittiger in the locker room . I asked : ' Is he the batboy ? ' The next night , he struck out 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pitch again , and that time he struck out 14. " // Bittiger , who played third base and pitched for Secaucus High School , laughs and says : " I was sitting in the stands with the batboy the night Lou showed up . A fan asked if we were the batboys , and I said : ' He is . I ' m pitching tomorrow night . Come out and watch. ' " // That was in 1981 . Last year , Bittiger led the Texas League in strikeouts , with 190 in 164 innings , and was voted the league ' s most valuable pitcher . He may not make the Mets this year because they have so many other rookies who are older , though not faster. // Rick Ownbey , a tall blond Californian , probably will make the team as a starting pitcher behind Tom Seaver , Craig Swan and Mike Torrez . In 1981 , he was second in strikeouts in the Texas League ; in 1982 , he was second in the International League . Both teams won championships. // " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve got two championship rings . There may be eight or nine other guys in camp who have one . Some guys in the big leagues never get one. " // Ownbey acknowledges that people are beating the drums for the young arms of the Mets , and says : " We ' ve pitched with each other or against each other in the minor leagues , and we feel a kind of unity . We ' re not a clique , and we don ' t hold meetings of young guys . But , in the next couple of years , we might all make it at the same time. " // The people running the Mets think so , too . They may merely be uttering the party line in the fourth year of the new ownership . But they insist that they own the best young arms in baseball , and say that veterans like Seaver and Torrez were imported to buy time until the rookies mature. // " That was the strategy from the start , " Gorman says . " Frank , Bambi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built from within . Frank always said it might take four or five years , but that ' s the course to follow . And pitching is the key. " // Whether they are prodigies or not , they are a mixed bunch in geography and personality . Tim Leary is a quiet Californian of 24 who hurt his elbow two years ago after pitching two innings in the big leagues . Ron Darling is a 22-year-old Yale man from Hawaii who can speak Chinese . Both may open the season in the International League , but they are rated the prize pupils. // Doug Sisk , who is 25 , has a sinkerball , a degree in criminal justice from Washington State and several national amateur medals as a rifleman . Scott Holman , a 24-year-old Californian , missed most of two years with a bad arm but has recovered strongly and may join Ownbey as a starter . Tom Gorman , a 25-year-old Oregonian , pitched briefly for the Montreal Expos and throws a forkball . He is the only left-hander in the bunch. // Walt Terrell , 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , the former Yankee star . Brent Gaff , also 24 , also from Indiana , pitched one month for the Mets last summer and won six of seven games in winter ball . Scott Dye , 26 , who comes from Mississippi , was a star field-goal kicker at Utah State. // " I don ' t know how I ' m going to cut this staff , " Bamberger says , sounding like a man with a problem . " Tidewater may wind up with the best pitching staff in the world . We ' ve got 20 pitchers in camp , 10 of them are rookies , all of them are power pitchers and most of them could pitch in the big leagues right now. " // Bamberger monitors his prodigies every morning at Payson Field , standing behind the assembly line while four pitchers at a time warm up from mounds six feet apart . In his hand , the manager carries his work chart , a precise timetable that says what every pitcher will be doing every day for a month . For no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry slip , and it shows things like this : // For the first week , everybody throws five minutes one day , seven the next , then 15 minutes after a day of rest . For the second week , everybody throws 15 minutes every other day . It says that everybody will pitch a lot , which is Bamberger ' s system . It says that Leary will pitch in the third exhibition game and Seaver in the fourth. // " All right , gentlemen , " Bamberger calls after 15 minutes , " let ' s have the next four . " Four more pitchers appear , and start firing to four catchers . Bamberger , who decided this year to serve as his own pitching coach , roams from mound to mound and makes adjustments in their motion , stride and follow-through. // " You can ' t keep going out , " he says , " and telling people , ' It ' s coming , it ' s coming . ' You ' ve got to go out and get better now . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . Not only that , but now we can trade pitchers for hitters , we have so many good kids . We ' d have nine guys to take their place. " // Seaver , who is 38 and the senior pitcher in rank and record , has not yet mingled very much with the rookies . But he agrees with the formula. // " Pitching is the way to do it , " he says . " The quickest way . It keeps you in games so that your defense and hitting can have the chance to win , and this team has more hitting than the 1967 team when I was a rookie. " // When Seaver was a rookie , the Mets were a last-place team that had never won anything . Now , they are a last-place team that is straining to win the pennant for the first time in 10 years , and the new ownership says " the kids " will do it. // Whitey Herzog , manager of the St. Louis Cardinals , who helped develop the young stars of the Mets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable , and adds : // " Tim Leary is the best young pitcher I ' ve seen since Seaver . " Leary , who says he is sound after two years of nursing a sore elbow and then a sore shoulder , holds two distinctions : He is the senior rookie in the bunch , and he is the chief reminder that pitching is a fragile commodity . He also agrees that the rookies may rescue the franchise , but doubts that they will be destroyed by the pressure of living up to that role. // " I didn ' t feel the pressure , " he says , " until I got hurt . Before that , I was just confident of my ability and happy for the chance to show it . Once I got hurt , though , everything fell apart . I found myself in New York , not able to pitch , and I had no bearings . Then the pressure was on me to produce. // " There may be pressure on us when people mention Tom Seaver , Jerry Koosman , Nolan Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty high level of expectation for any group of young ones. // " But within our group , we can alleviate the pressure . There ' s a group identity . When you ' re doing the exercises on the field , you see a lot of guys with less than three years ' service , a few older ones , and you realize there ' s not much in between. " // " It ' s good they got Seaver , " Leary says . " Attention flows to him , and that takes it off us young guys . I saw it happen in Los Angeles . When they brought up kids like Steve Howe and Steve Sax , they ' d be overshadowed and protected by veterans like Steve Garvey and Ron Cey. " // Where did the Mets get so many strong-armed young men after years of waiting for the farm system to produce ? " More aggressive scouting , more aggressive teaching , " Cashen says . " My target was 1984 , even though last year ' s collapse set us back a year. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years lately for high school and college players , " Gorman says . " Maybe 1980 was the best ever . We had four draft picks in the first 27 players that year . On the first round , we got Darryl Strawberry and Billy Beane , two fine outfielders , and later we got Bittiger and Ownbey. // " This year , because we lost Pete Falcone as a free agent , we ' ll have four picks in the first 29 players . Maybe 50 percent of the players we pick are pitchers . You never know how they ' ll turn out , or how healthy they ' ll stay . But this group is exceptional. " // " I told them to learn to throw strikes , " Bamberger said . " If you guys walk 582 men like the ones last year , you ' ll be gone , like the ones last year . And if you walk all those guys and stay , I ' ll be gone. " //               @ @ @ @ @ @
