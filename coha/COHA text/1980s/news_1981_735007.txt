txt HE WOMAN ; Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy , already has achieved a certain mythical importance in the country . It is not her fault as much as it is her fate . Just as we all remember where we were when her husband , our President , John Fitzgerald Kennedy , was shot , many of us also will never forget the endless pictures of the woman in the pink , bloodstained suit with matching pillbox hat , the grieving widow , the jet-set princess married to the Greek tycoon . . . and all the other repeating media images of Jackie 0 . that ? before Nov. 22 , 1963 , and after ? have been cathode-ray-tubed into our brains . Who is this woman ? How did she grow up ? Why is her relationship with her father such a key to her personality ? What is her personality ? How did she and Jack get along ? And ? the ultimate media question of all ? why do we care ? Given her mythical stature , her mysterious past , people do care . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always will be fair game . So , I guess , it comes as no great surprise to hear that ABC is planning a three-hour TV docudrama version of her early years for fall , starting at age 5 and taking her up to the assassination . WHAT IS SURPRISING is what a puff-piece " Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy " sounds like . It 's one thing for ABC to want to recreate a kind of " Camelot " feeling in the country ; it 's quite another to docudrama history in such a way as to risk totally distorting and destroying the complexities of her life , all in the name of being positive , upbeat , and " setting the record straight . " And yet that 's just what the people behind " Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy " intend . " We call it , an affectionate portrait , " said Jacyln Smith ( who was chosen for the role , the producer says , in spite of her five-year association with the " Charlie 's Angels " series ) . " It 's really a romantic comedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but respect . She drops her Ft 's and she wears wigs , but she does n't try to do an imitation as much as she tries to capture the qualities that in . her mind make Mrs. Onassis such an exceptional woman . ONE DAY LAST week , Smith and James Franciscus , who plays Jack Kennedy , joined executive producer Lou Rudolph and writer Steve Gethers in telling the visiting TV press why " Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy " is such an interesting and important project . On the one hand , they said , it could be the best researched and documented docudrama ever done for TV . Gethers , for instance , claims he used 29 books on the Kennedys and insists that every line of dialog has been checked and rechecked for accuracy . On the other hand ? and this is the part that makes you wonder ? Gethers describes the film as a " beautiful , beautiful love story . " Franciscus sees it as a Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn comedy , and producer Rudolph says he made it to try to counterbalance the bad press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about how they fell in love and why , " Franciscus said , " and deals with their sense of humor , the twinkle they had in their eyes , how they touched each other 's hearts and souls . " WHAT ABOUT John Kennedy 's notorious need to touch other women , women he was not married to ? If indeed this docudrama is supposed to be the best researched docudrama in the whole sordid history of docudramas ? as Jaclyn Smith in her role as " Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy . " Rudolph and Gethers would have us believe ? would n't it be reasonable to expect a tasteful treatment of some of the more human issues that seem to have touched their lives ? Au contraire . This is " Camelot , " not " Kennedy vs . Kennedy . " " We 're not doing that kind of movie , " said Gethers , who unfortunately Is doing the kind of movie that many people in the country will view as true-to-life fact . " We do not deal in the sensational aspects of things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , there will be no Mention of any affairs . Gethers says that in all 29 books he read , he just did n't find the proof he needed to even suggest . Jack Kennedy saw other women . WHAT ABOUT THE Bay of Pigs then ? That has been fairly well documented . " The Bay of Pigs is n't part of our story , " Gethers said . He 's pretty sure that it was mentioned somewhere in the 29 hooks he read , but he does n't see how it might have affected their relationship . " What about Jackie 's first encounter with Onassis ? How do you handle that ? " one critic wanted to know . Forget it . There is no scene in the filth like that . " Do n't forget , " Gethers said , " this movie ? ends at the assassination . " " They met before the assassination . " " Oh . " Gethers and Rudolph do n't think they 're being irresponsible in their video rewrite of history . Docudramas always involve artistic choices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing to present a positive , upbeat view and what's-wrong-with-that ? NOTHING , IF YOU like puffery . Nothing , if you think docudramas should be able to say anything , show anything , hide anything all in the name of artistic license . As it was described , " Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy " takes no risks . It avoids controversy instead of dealing with it , the way Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy must deal with it in her own life . Is it any wonder that the Kennedys have had nothing whatsoever to do with it ? Rudolph , who also brought the docudrama versions of " Ike " and " Attica " to TV , says he wrote a letter to Mrs. Onassis explaining the project and asking for her cooperation but , as Rudolph put it , " she approves nothing . " What Mrs. Onassis did do , at first , through her associate Nancy Tuckerman , suggest some books for Gethers to read . Rudolph admits that . the only reason she went that far is because she thought the film was going to be straight documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docudrama ( Rudolph insists he was very clear about his intentions ) , Mrs. Onassis withdrew completely . DOES THAT BOTHER Jaclyn Smith ? Does n't she feel just a little slimy playing a woman who does n't want to be played , a woman she has never met or spoken to , a woman who clearly wishes to keep her private world private ? " I feel if she watches this , she 'll be pleased , " Smith said . " It presents a side of her that no one knows . " But does n't that make it even more of an intrusion ? Not in Smith 's mind . " It 's not an intrusion , " she said . " If it were , we would n't have cared to do it . It 's the opposite of intrusion . It 's a very positive portrait . "
