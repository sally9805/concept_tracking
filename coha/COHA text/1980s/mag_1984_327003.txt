BEVERLY HILLS COP Directed by Martin Brest ; Screenplay by Daniel Petrie Jr . <P> <P> Detective Axel Foley ( Eddie Murphy ) has just been busted for disturbing the affluence of Beverly Hills ; a few moments before , some bad guys had shattered decorum and a plate-glass window by heaving him through the latter . Now Axel , who hails from Detroit , where the fuzz 's lot is mostly scuzz , looks wonderingly around . " This is the cleanest and nicest police car I 've ever been in in my life , " he murmurs . " This thing 's nicer than my apartment . " Very politely he requests the arresting officers to pull over if they just happen to spot any movie stars on the way to the station house . <P> Nor is that the end of the astonishments visited upon him while using some vacation time to investigate the murder of his best old friend . In Beverly Hills , in addition to your Miranda rights , you are apparently entitled to be addressed as " sir " until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a scrupulously buttoned three-piece suit . It comes as a relief to Axel when a questioner gives him a sneak punch in the gut . He takes it as a signal that the traditional basics of police work have not been entirely forgotten among the boutiques and the Mercedes . <P> Beverly Hills Cop is a comedy of mutual dismay , in which Axel 's culture shock over the way his West Coast colleagues gumshoe through Lotusland is matched by their outraged puzzlement over how to handle a streetwise hipster for whom anarchy is both a way of life and an investigative technique . Were Eddie Murphy absent from this movie one might decry its ambling and the failure of writer and director to develop out of a fertile premise either a well-twisted mystery or some truly wild comic turns . But Murphy is very much present , and it could be argued that their task was not so much to provide a taut story line as to create a cheerful climate where his marvelous talent and his compelling yet gracefully stated energy could sprout in all directions . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a very important journalist , terrorizing a snooty hotel into giving him a room despite his lack of a reservation . See him , a moment later , impersonate a delivery boy soft-shoeing his way past a wary receptionist . And watch closely , for in the wink of a camera 's eye he is going to be a furious Customs inspector whose bite is worse than his bark . Or a homosexual lisping his way past a posh club 's matre d ' with a particularly mad invention . Murphy exudes the kind of cheeky , cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup , snarling his way out of the ghetto . But as befits a manchild of the soft-spoken ' 80s , there is an insinuating sweetness about the heart that is always visible on the sleeve of Murphy 's habitual sweatshirt . It is discernible not only by adolescent females but by case-hardened critics as well .
