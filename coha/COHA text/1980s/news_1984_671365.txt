With the victory , which ended with some players brawling and a few fans jostling Coach Al Arbour , the Canadiens continued to sidetrack the New Yorkers ' drive for a fifth straight Stanley Cup - a feat accomplished only by the Canadiens of 1956-60. // There was a French identity in those championship days . These Canadiens , who finished the regular season five games under . 500 , are symbolized by Mats Naslund , who scored twice tonight . He is the only Swedish-born player Montreal has had. // Perhaps the end of the game set the tempo for the clubs ' next meeting in this four-of-seven series , Saturday night at Nassau Coliseum . Arbour threatened to send his Islanders over the boards , if necessary , to fight some more. // Arbour ' s anger spilled over into a post-game tirade against the National Hockey League and tonight ' s officials , contending : " The league seems to be pulling for Montreal. " // But there was confusion over a pivotal play late in the second period , and that confusion might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials ' . // The game ultimately hinged on it . The score was 3-2 with seconds remaining in the second period . Denis Potvin , who has more playoff experience than any active player , and Billy Smith , who has appeared in more games than any other current goalie , both thought that Swede Knox , a linesman , had wiped out an offside call , which would have brought a faceoff in the Montreal end . However , Knox said after the game that he had never wiped out the icing call. // " Denis thought it was called off , but it wasn ' t , " said Knox. // " There seemed to be some confusion on Potvin ' s part , " added Referee Bryan Lewis. // In frustration at what he thought the official had called , Potvin threw his hands into the air . His stick sailed out of his hands and hit Knox . Lewis immediately called an unsportsmanlike-conduct on Potvin. // It carried over to the final session , when , with 47 seconds gone , Naslund scored the crushing blow. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was made , " said Lewis after the game. // When asked about Arbour ' s remark that the league is favoring Montreal , Lewis replied , " If Al said that , then what ' s been the end result ? " meaning that officiating hadn ' t halted the Islanders in the past. // In their four straight cups the Islanders never trailed by two games . The last time they were down by 0-2 happened seven years ago today . Ken Dryden was in the nets for the Canadiens , opposing Smith . The Canadiens went on to win. // These Islanders are noted for their depth . But tonight , they lost two important players , perhaps for the remainder of the playoffs. // Stefan Persson suffered a separated left shoulder - the fourth Islander to suffer the injury recently . The defenseman expects to be out at least two weeks . And Bob Bourne was s sidelined indefinitely with ligament injury to his left knee , joining the defenseman , Dave Langevin. // The game , which at times reached incredible intensity in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ice along the sideboards . Smith dashed over , and began battling with Rick Green . Richard Sevigny , the backup goalie , intercepted Smith and they started punching . Sevigny will be suspended for the next game because this was his second major playoff penalty. // Earlier , the Islanders fiercely attempted to stop history from repeating . In the opening 36 seconds , they blasted three shots at Penney . But the rest of the game , only 14 more were on . None came from Mike Bossy , whose erstwhile scoring partner , Bryan Trottier , has produced only 1 assist in 12 playoff games. // The teams traded first-period goals . Smith stopped Perry Turnbull ' s shot , but Pierre Mondou cut down the middle , around Tomas Jonsson , and smashed home the rebound after 7 : 46. // A little more than four minutes later , Clark Gillies , positioned in the slot , deflected in Jonsson ' s shot. // It halted the Islanders ' nonscoring stretch against Penney at 71 : 58. // Steve Shutt , a reborn Canadien hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 18 of the second period. // Midway through the period , Mondou broke past Greg Gilbert and fed Naslund , who scored on a high shot. // Later in the period , though , the Islanders finally scored on a power play . They had failed on their first four in the two games here , and had been only 4 of 43 in the playoffs - the worst stretch in their history. // Potvin , who hadn ' t scored in the playoffs , drove in a wrist shot . <> <> Rest at Home // // The fourth game will be held at the Coliseum Tuesday night . Serge Savard , the managing director , had planned to take all the Canadiens to Roosevelt Raceway on Sunday , then discovered there is no Sunday racing . The Canadiens instead will fly home after Saturday ' s game . They will return to Long Island Monday night. // //
