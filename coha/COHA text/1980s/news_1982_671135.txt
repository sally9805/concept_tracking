The Primate , Archbishop Jozef Glemp , said the Government must also make other concessions to bring about a reconciliation with an " angry " people. // With an eye on anti-Government demonstrations planned for next week on the anniversary of the Gdansk agreements that recognized the Solidarity union headed by Mr. Walesa , the Archbishop repeatedly sounded an appeal for calm . He called on Poles not to take to the streets but to submerge their anger in the consolation of prayer. // " On our streets enough blood has been shed , " he said . " The place for the dialogue is at the table . " <> <> A Show of Strength // The demonstrations have been called by Solidarity leaders in hiding to mark the second anniversary of strike settlements on the Baltic coast that led to the creation of the first independent union in the Soviet bloc . They are shaping up as a show of strength for the union , now suspended , and the martial law authorities have made it clear that they intend to deal with any illegal gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s press , which , among other things , printed the full text of a television speech last night by Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak , Minister of Internal Affairs . In it he said the authorities had sufficient force to deal with demonstrators who , he charged , were planing violent actions. // At the same time the official press agency reported unrest at the giant Adolf Warski shipyard in the castal city of Szczecin , which was the scene of bloody protests in 1970 and victorious strikes in August 1980. // The agency said that 39 people were suspended last week after a demonstration in which workers left the yard to lay flowers at a memorial to colleagues killed in 1970. // Leaflets calling for further protests on Monday were circulating , the agency said , and the authorities might be forced to take drastic action - including closing the shipyard - to " prevent a catastrophe. " // A measure of official concern over the situation there was seen in the fact that Kazimierz Barcikowski , a senior member of the party Politburo and the man who negotiated the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there today to talk with party members and others . He accused the union of " counterrevolutionary hostility and political stupidity " and warned that organizers of demonstrations would be brought to account . He called for " reason and calm " on all sides. // An attempt to head off a violent confrontation was a major theme in the Primate ' s sermon , delivered on the 600th anniversary of the founding of the Paulite monastery at Jasna Gora , which contains Poland ' s most sacred icon , the Black Madonna. // But even more striking was the forceful reiteration of the Catholic church ' s position on what he termed " conditions " for opening talks between the Government and the people. // " First , free Lech Walesa - or insure him conditions in which he can speak out as a free man , " he declared , and instantly the throng assembled in a hilltop meadow under the medieval ramparts of the sanctuary broke out in prolonged applause . A sprinkling of Solidarity banners waved in the warm breeze . <> <> Pimate Chastizes Crowd // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had asked for his speech to be given with no interruptions , and he went on to list other conditions . A second was the reactivation , if only gradually , of the trade unions . A third was the release of all internees , who number more than 630 , and a fourth was preparations for an amnesty for people arrested and convicted under martial law . Official sources put this figure at about 3 , 000. // Finally , the Primate demanded the fixing of a definite date for a visit by Pope John Paul . The Pope was to have revisited his homeland for the ceremonies here today , but the trip was put off at the insistence of the authorities who feared it could further unsettle the precarious political climate. // When the Primate completed the list of demands , the crowd responded with a sea of raised arms in victory signs , a gesture of support for Solidarity . Even members of the choir on a stone balcony behind him and several monks in white robes joined in. // The demands did not go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as significant that the Primate was raising them now . For months the church hierarchy has appeared to play down its objections to martial law , concentrating instead on calls for peace and talks . <> <> Some Grumbling Over Church // The emphasis has spawned some dissatisfaction among Poles , who occasionaly grumble that the church is cooperating too closely with the Government . Three weeks ago , for example , a banner was laid at a floral cross in memory of the late Primate , Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski , that read : " To the honor of the greatest Primate Poland ever had ; we are waiting to see his successor . " It was signed , " Workers of Solidarity. " // Today the Primate went to great lengths in insisting that " the church is very close to the suffering of the people . " He declared at one point : " The church realizes the effects of the danger done by harm to the people . We are with those who locked themselves inside the factories to fight for the violated rights of the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // He also read out portions of a letter that he said he had received from the mother of an internee " recently beaten up at Kwidzyn , " a detention camp in the north . No account of an incident in the camp , in which security forces put down a disturbance Aug. 14 , have appeared in Polish news outlets . Such situations , the Primate said , " create feelings of anger and revenge. " // But he noted that the church must remain above politics . " It can not become an instrument in the hands of social groups or the state. // The Primate called the agreements that ended the strikes two years ago " a victory of reason , maturity , wisdom and peace , " which he said still held the message that reconcilation was possible , though " not on street barricades but at the table of dialogue . " <> <> ' Lessons of History ' Cited // He asked Poles to learn " the lessons of history " and cited the January uprising of the 19th century against the Russians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destruction and , even worse , long-lasting slavery. " // The icon whose anniversary was celebrated is hallowed by legend , and is believed by some to be a painting by St. Luke the Evangelist done on a wooden plank that served as a table for the Holy Family in Nazareth . Its fame spread after it was slashed by the iconoclastic Hussite brothers in 1430 , and especially after the monastery fended off a siege by Swedish invaders in 1655 , an event that made " Our Lady " the protector of Poland. //
