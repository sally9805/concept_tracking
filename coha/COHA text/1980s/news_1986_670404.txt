But the Prime Minister , David Lange , minimized the seriousness of the American decision , insisting that it was meaningless since New Zealand faced no threat from anyone , and because the wording of the treaty made it clear that even in the case of a genuine threat to New Zealand , there was no automatic guarantee that the United States would help. // He added that if New Zealand was faced with a concerted Soviet invasion , he doubted that no one would come to its aid. // The suspension of the alliance was disclosed after Mr. Shultz and Mr. Lange , in their first meeting in two years , failed to make any progress in avoiding a rupture in relations that will become official in August . <> <> ' We Part Company ' // " We part company as friends , but we part company , as far as the alliance is concerned , " Mr. Shultz said. // A senior State Department official said formal written notification of the American decision not to be bound by the Anzus treaty to come to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lange ' s Government in August of a " no nuclear " law. // The Reagan Administration made its decision because of New Zealand ' s insistence on banning visits by nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships . Washington regards that as a repudiation of Wellington ' s obligations under the accord , Mr. Shultz said. // " I ' d hate to see the New Zealand policy spread , " Mr. Shultz said at a news conference this afternoon , " because it would basically cripple the ability of the United States and our allies to defend the values that we and New Zealand and others share. " // Washington warned in April that it would take this step as a signal of its concern that a ban on visits by its Navy ships could lead to efforts by antinuclear activists to block such transit stops by American nuclear-armed ships and planes in other countries . <> <> Not Contagious , Lange Says // Prime Minister Lange , however , ridiculed the contention that his Government ' s actions might be contagious. // He said that since 1984 , the deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European countries. // " We have not seen the fragmentation of civilization as we know it , " he said . " We have been a responsible member of the Western community . We have discharged our obligations in the Pacific. " // " It is not as if we slipped somewhere between Albania and Nicaragua , " he said. // Mr. Lange also seemed confident that his Government would not lose domestic support over the rift with the Americans . <> <> Two-Year-Old Dispute // The dispute between the two longtime allies over the nuclear ship issue has strained the Pacific alliance between Australian , New Zealand and the United States for the last two years . The treaty name , Anzus , is an acronym from the names of the three nations. // The rift between Washington and Wellington has put pressures on Australia ' s Labor Government , which has sought to remain on good terms with both its Anzus partners . Foreign Minister Bill Hayden of Australia , who was here for the meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , stressed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Zealand. // This means that in practice , instead of one three-nation Anzus alliance , there will be two separate military arrangements in the region for the foreseeable future , one between the United States and Australia , and the other between Australia and New Zealand. // The United States , Australia and New Zealand signed a mutual defense treaty for the Southwest Pacific in September 1951 , originally to guard against a possible new attack by Japan , their common enemy in the war that ended six years earlier. // Under the treaty , naval and air exercises were carried out routinely in the region . But the accession of the Lange Government in July 1984 created deep strains in relations because of Mr. Lange ' s commitment to banning all nuclear activities from New Zealand . <> <> Won ' t Confirm Nuclear Arming // The United States has followed a policy of never confirming or denying that a particular ship or plane was carrying nuclear weapons .

The Administration sought to persuade Mr. Lange to adopt a similar passive policy , but he refused. // Mr. Lange said the legislation that would be enacted by his Government in August " will require that we do not have in New Zealand ships which are nuclear armed or propelled , and that ' s where the problem lies. " // He said Washington feared that his Government would carry out the anti-nuclear policy " with a rigor that does not characterize other countries that purport to exclude nuclear weapons. " // In discussing his fruitless talks with Mr. Shultz , Mr. Lange said : " The Secretary has said that the United States will withdraw its security guarantee . The Secretary said the security relationship is terminated . " <> <> Essence of Alliance Cited // Mr. Shultz , in confirming this at a separate news conference later , blamed Mr. Lange ' s Government for refusing to shift away from its antinuclear policy .

" At least that is the prospect of it as it is unfolding. " // The United States has responded so strongly , according to Mr. Shultz , because of American concerns that if New Zealand could prevent nuclear-armed Navy ships and Air Force and Navy planes from using New Zealand as a transit point , despite the commitments in the Anzus treaty , this could touch off efforts by antinuclear groups in other allied countries. // " We don ' t have ships with nuclear weapons on them because we like it , " Mr. Shultz said . " We have them because the United States has a responsibility to deter aggression , and that comes from the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t have nuclear weapons and have the capability to deter their aggression with them , then we subject everyone , including ourselves , to nuclear blackmail from the Soviet Union.

" It will have a nine-day wonder effect. " // " Does the Anzus treaty determine through what eyes the United States sees a defense strategy throughout the Pacific ? " he said . " Or is there a collective interest by people broadly of Western orientation to see that there is no physical molesting of smaller nations by huge countries ? " // Mr. Shultz said the United States hoped that with the Anzus framework left intact , New Zealand at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the alliance to be revived. //
