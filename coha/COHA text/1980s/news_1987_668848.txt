A former marine who served at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna with Sgt. Clayton Lonetree testified Friday that the two almost got into a fight when Lonetree argued that communism was superior to a democratic form of government . " He was standing over me  --  I was sitting at the end of the table  --  and he stood over me and I felt for a few moments that there was going to be some fisticuffs involved , " recalled John R. Muldowney , now a civilian . " I had the feeling that he was very angry and frustrated at his lack of being able to defend against anything I was saying against communism . " On the fourth day of testimony in Lonetree ' s court-martial , Muldowney said the incident took place in the Marine House in Vienna . He did not give the exact day of the incident , but it appeared to have occurred between last March , when Lonetree was first posted in Vienna , and his arrest in December . At that point in 1986 , according to the government ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Soviet woman in Moscow and was under pressure from KGB agents to give them increasing amounts of secret U.S. data . Describing himself as a friend of Lonetree , Muldowney said he jokingly referred to the young American Indian as " comrade " in many of their discussions because of Lonetree ' s views on communism and the unusual number of Soviet memorabilia he kept in his room . " It really occurred to me quite a few times that when I walked into his room , I was not walking into a U.S. Marine room  --  there was nothing American there , " Muldowney testified . " I got the distinct feeling that , by talking to Sgt. Lonetree , that the KGB was a superior intelligence agency than ours , that he had sort of an affinity for the KGB , " he said . Defense lawyers have argued that it was not unusual for a marine to collect souvenirs in his assigned country of duty . In other testimony Friday , one of Lonetree ' s former marine roommates testified that the defendant mentioned the KGB at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a KGB agent , worked for the KGB because they were a really good spy operation , " said Cpl . Michael Lavato , who served with Lonetree at Camp Pendleton , Calif. , from 1983 to 1984 . Testifying under cross-examination , Lavato pointed out that Lonetree said the KGB seemed far more efficient than the CIA . Both witnesses were called by government lawyers , apparently to help demonstrate that Lonetree harbored resentment toward the United States , a motive for spying that prosecutors have attributed to the former Marine Corps security guard . The defense tried to show that many of Lonetree ' s comments were expressed within the larger context of pointing out inequities in American society . Lonetree , 25 , of St. Paul , is the first marine to stand trial for espionage . If convicted of the most serious charge against him , he could be sentenced to life in prison . David Moyer , the supervisor of the Naval Investigative Service ' s inquiry of the Lonetree case , testified how investigators obtained incriminating statements from Lonetree , which the marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonetree
