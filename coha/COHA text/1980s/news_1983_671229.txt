For the first time , manufacturers of both kinds of machines are angling for the same customers , and they have rushed to make their products more alike . Analysts view the new competition , which has become more pronounced in the past month , as another broad and somewhat unexpected change in the confusing contour of the home electronics market. // " This has always been a fast-moving industry , " said Clive Smith , an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston . " But things are moving so fast that companies can not keep up . What is marketed today may well be obsolete in a few months . It is impossible to create a coherent marketing strategy under such conditions. " // // Competition in Two Forms // The competition for the low end of the consumer electronics market has taken two forms . Game manufacturers such as Atari Inc . , Mattel Inc. and Coleco Industries have begun peddling additional equipment that they say will turn their video games into full-fledged computers . Experts have their doubts , but say the move may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video game units in American homes. // At the same time , the price of inexpensive computers , made by such companies as Texas Instruments Inc. and Commodore International Ltd. , is dropping to about the price of video game consoles . For $75 to $200 , consumers can buy a basic computer that can play games - although without some of the advanced graphics available on video game machines - and can also serve some educational functions and figure the family finances. // Computer makers are betting that consumers will sacrifice better game-playing for more serious pursuits . While " home " computers still can not perform many of the advanced functions of " personal " computers , which are more expensive , sales of home computers jumped to 2. 2 million units last year , up from 385 , 000 the year before . Analysts expect about 5 million units , worth $2 billion , to be sold this year . <> <> Game Cartridge Shipments Plunge // While hard evidence is scarce , it appears that many of the computer sales are coming at the expense of video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . Shipments of video game cartridges dropped dramatically in the first quarter of 1983 , to 16. 6 million units from 24 million the previous quarter . The health of the video game industry is generally measured in terms of cartridge sales , while the computer industry pays closer attention to hardware sales. // " You are seeing a dramatic transfer to the computer market , " said Christopher Kirby , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &; Company . " A lot of video game systems are sitting on the shelf in the family room. " // In an apparent effort to replace video games in the home , Commodore International announced a rebate program three weeks ago under which purchasers of the Commodore 64 , a $400 machine , can receive $100 back - if they mail to Commodore any used video game or computer. // While Commodore declined to comment specifically on its strategy , Myr Ddin Jones , vice president of marketing , said : " We think that with the built-in capability of computers like ours , there will be continued pressure on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game manufacturers are fighting back . In February , Atari , a division of Warner Communications Inc. , said that it would market later this year a keyboard attachment to its least expensive video game unit , to make it more like an Atari home computer . Mattel announced a similar attachment last week , along with a generalpurpose computer , the company ' s first . Coleco ' s part computer , part video game system , to be marketed later this year , will include a small floppy disk drive for storing text , and a printer. // Erasing the difference between computers and video games , however , requires overcoming some basic design differences . While both machines have microchips at their core , video games are designed only to play games . Home computers are designed for many purposes . While the video game programs are unalterable , most programs for home computers can be written by the user or purchased and altered . <> <> Inflexibility // Thus , many experts say that video games are not flexible enough to make effective general-purpose computers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can buy in a department store , take home and plug in , " said Edward Currie , president of Lifeboat Associates , a New York software house . " A computer is something that requires a lot more customer support , and I don ' t think that the people who have been selling video games are ready to provide that support . " <> <> Poor Sales in Quarter // Ready or not , quarterly sales underscore the urgency many video game makers feel . Warner had a fourth-quarter loss of $18. 9 million , and said its consumer electronics operations , which consists almost entirely of Atari , lost nearly $45. 6 million . Mattel reported that for the quarter ended Jan. 29 it lost $20. 2 million , down from earnings of $16. 7 million in the same quarter of 1982 . Coleco , in contrast , performed strongly , with earnings of $16. 2 million in the quarter. // In addition , inexpensive computers such as Commodore ' s VIC-20 and Texas Instrument ' s 99-4A are already selling for less than many video games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time undercut the price of its most expensive video game unit with its least expensive computer. // But home computer makers and video game makers entering new waters may face more obstacles in coming months from the Japanese and the International Business Machines Corporation . Several Japanese companies are preparing to introduce low-cost , high-performance home computers in the United States. // I.B.M. is expected to announce the " Peanut , " a stripped-down version of its personal computer , in the next few months . The machine may sell for as low as $700 , and is expected to include processing and memory capabilities far in excess of anything now on the market for under $1 , 500. //
