Tracking Lincoln 's murderer , Edward 's jewels and other prey <P> Historical thrillers are the meatiest of all mysteries . They are connected to reality like funny bone to shoulder bone , insidiously subverting the official versions of history . Gore Vidal 's Burr , for instance , and-more inventively-Nicholas Meyer 's The Seven-Per-Cent Solution plausibly : combine wit , suspense , speculation and scholarship . Novels like these not only induce insomnia but are also hallucinogenic , tingeing with fantasy the reader 's remembrance of known fact . <P> For example : since Lincoln 's assassination 115 years ago , scores of books have been written about the conspiracy and the characters surrounding it . None has dispelled the legend that the man who was tried and hanged for the crime , Actor John Wilkes Booth , was not the real murderer . The Cosgrove Report by G.J.A. O'Toole ( Rawson , Wade ; 424 pages ; $12.95 ) , though fictional , makes the strongest case yet that Booth escaped . This is not an easy task : the actor had one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The novel purports to be " the Private Inquiry of a Pinkerton Detective into the Death of President Lincoln , " as edited and verified in recent years by another private investigator , Michael Croft , Colonel , U.S. Army ( ret . ) . The Pinkerton man , a Jules Vernian character named Nicholas Cosgrove , has been retained by <P> Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to investigate rumors of Booth 's survival , three years after the murder . The Pink soon finds that the coffin in which J.W. Booth has been interred is empty . He also finds that Washington City , as it was then called , is a nest of intrigue and calumny . Even the greatest names are not free of suspicion . Cosgrove , posing as a salesman of a potent potion called Hostetter Bitters , works out of a safe house on K Street . <P> President Andrew Johnson , who had been Lincoln 's Veep , is scurrilously rumored to have been privy to the conspiracy-and is facing impeachment over his " soft " policy toward the defeated South . Secretary Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So is General Ulysses S. Grant , by now a leading contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency . Politics aside , there are strong inducements for those involved to claim that the real Booth had been run to ground : not least , the $50,000 War Department reward for his capture . It is up to Cosgrove , largely on his own , to trace the actual circumstances of Lincoln 's assassination , Booth 's escape and supposed death after a twelve-day hunt , and the mysterious burial . The Pinkerton man , a former Union spy , leaves no headstone unturned tracking the actor , a onetime Confederate agent . It is a harrowing assignment , leading him to prod such sacred cows as Robber Baron Jay Gould and General Lafayette C. Baker , Lincoln 's spymaster . By carriage , train , boat and balloon , Cosgrove stumbles on one denouement after another - though the last and most dramatic is supplied by Colonel Croft .
