Bush will probably urge policies of caution and balance <P> George Bush seemed nervous . It was a rare occasion on which he shared a platform with the head of his ticket , Ronald Reagan . Bush 's voice was reedier than usual , his introductory praise of Reagan awkwardly effusive , his applause during Reagan 's speech a shade overeager . Then a man sitting in a tree shouted something that made the crowd in Birmingham , Mich. , laugh . A puzzled Reagan announced into an open microphone : " I did n't hear . " Like a jack-in-the-box , Bush popped up to cup his hand around Reagan 's ear and whisper what the tree sitter had said about Jimmy Carter : " He 's a jerk . " Reagan chuckled , and Bush sat down smiling , glad to have been of service . <P> That scene illustrates the paradox that Bush will face when he is sworn in as Vice President . As No. 2 to a President who will turn 70 only 17 days after his Inauguration , Bush has unusually strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite apart from any possibility that he might have to finish Reagan 's term , the widespread expectation that Reagan will retire after four years makes Bush a potential front runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 1984 . But Bush knows that he can capitalize on his position only by loyally serving a very traditionalist chief who will probably require him to play the Vice President 's classic public role of Invisible Man-and that he can exert influence only by metaphorically , if not literally , whispering into Reagan 's ear . <P> As Bush sometimes told campaign audiences , " If I gain Reagan 's confidence , I 'll have tons to do . If I do n't , I 'll be going to funerals in Paraguay . " To TIME he predicted with characteristic preppie self-confidence : " I 'll get into the inner circle because I 'm intelligent and motivated by what 's in the best interest of the country . " Reagan has said that he will seek Bush 's advice on foreign affairs , national security matters and relations with Capitol Hill , befitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . and China and director of the CIA . Bush will probably urge a policy of caution and balance , two qualities that Reagan had trouble convincing some voters he possessed . <P> But Bush makes clear that he expects to operate strictly behind the scenes while doing little in the public eye , except perhaps attending those foreign funerals . His model Vice President is Nelson Rockefeller . At meetings of the National Security Council that Bush attended in 1975-76 as head of the CIA , he recalls , " Rockefeller gave his advice and would speak up even if he disagreed with President Ford . He was strong , and Ford was impressed . " Bush says he will do the same , but he adds that " if Reagan took a position that I disagreed with , I would not try to embarrass the President of the United States " by even leaking dissent . He showed that style during the campaign . While Bush was visiting China in August , Reagan said he favored " official " relations between the U.S. and Taiwan ; Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure his hosts that Reagan 's remarks had been misinterpreted .
