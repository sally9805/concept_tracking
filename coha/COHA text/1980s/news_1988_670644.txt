But Rudolph W. Giuliani , the United States Attorney for the Southern District , said the law , to his knowledge , had " never been used before to go after a lease in public housing.

" It turns the presumption of innocence upside down . It tramples on notions of due process. " // Only programs that address the causes of the drug problem will have a chance of working , Mr. Siegel said , adding that yesterday ' s action was " merely another form of political grandstanding by public officials.

She added that no rent would be paid in the meantime. // In recent months Federal authorities have been using the seizure law in New York City when they raid buildings believed to be major drug selling or manufacturing locations. // In April , for example , Federal authorities seized two adjoining buildings on Staten Island that the police said had been used as a crack factory and drug supermarket .

He said the Federal law used to seize the apartments was much more effective. // Asked what happens when a suspect ' s apartment is seized and the person is released on bail with no other place to live , the Mayor replied , amid laughter , " He can come into our shelters.
