There are two Gore Vidals . Vidal the novelist-author of 20-odd inert potboilers about sex and history  --  hardly merits serious consideration . Yet the other Vidal , Vidal the essayist , demands notice . The strongest of his pieces grab one ' s attention and refuse to let go . At once forthright and mendacious , smart and demented , they ' re written ( at best ) with panache , vigor and a caustic , often perverse wit . If as a political thinker Vidal is a national disgrace , as a stylist he ' s almost a national treasure . Mr. Vidal ' s is a style that leans heavily for its effects on a repertoire of punchy phrases and Wildean quips . But whereas Oscar Wilde reversed familiar expressions in order to provide a fresh look at reality ( e. g . , " Work is the curse of the drinking classes " ) , Mr. Vidal often turns the truth itself on its head . He writes of " Hoover socialism " and its replacement by the " classic capitalistic measures " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dominated by outspoken Marxists and radical feminists , Mr. Vidal describes the typical professor-writer as a mute coward , afraid to speak critically of our " garrison state " ( that is , America ) . Like most of his essay collections  --  this is his sixth  --  " At Home : Essays 1982-1988 " ( Random House , 303 pages , $18. 95 ) includes not only political tirades but also literary pieces ( on Henry James , Paul Bowles and Frederic Prokosch , among others ) . And make no mistake : When he writes about literature , Mr. Vidal can be wonderfully sane and astute , scorning academic mumbo-jumbo and defending high aesthetic standards . But his political pieces are another story . Their overriding message is plain : America is not a democracy but  --  in his words  --  an oligarchy , authoritarian and imperialistic . The oligarchs ( habitually tagged " our masters " or " our rulers " ) are military contractors and their confederates in the U.S. government . Their aim ? To get rich by spending taxpayer money on " a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for American liberties . He uses no word more sarcastically than freedom , routinely employing the phrase " freedom ' s home " as an ironic synonym for America . Yet who has benefited more from Western freedoms than Mr. Vidal ? He heaps endless scorn upon Americans for their prejudice against homosexuality , implying that nowhere else have people ever been so unenlightened and intolerant on this subject . Yet where in the world  --  and when in history  --  have the rights of homosexuals been more protected than in America today ? Despite his profession of belief in democracy ( of a socialist variety ) , no one has more contempt than he for the common man ; to Mr. Vidal , the average American is a bigoted , consumerist " Christer " marching in lockstep with his neighbors . Indeed , though he has an occasional kind word for an ally or booster ( respectfully memorializing , for instance , his Rome neighbor and blurb-provider Italo Calvino ) , and is capable of affectionate condescension ( as in a piece on Tennessee Williams ) , human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At odds with Mr. Vidal ' s supposed democratic sympathies is his reverence for power . " Power not sex , " he writes ( plainly extrapolating from his own case ) , " is the true motor to human life . " He equates power hunger with genius , celebrating Lincoln ' s emancipation of the slaves not as a noble act but as the act of a " towering genius " bent on immortality . But Mr. Vidal ' s hero is , and always will be , Mr. Vidal . Whether his subject is government or Hollywood , he finds a way to focus on himself . Thus a piece " On Flying " begins with an account of how he became " a footnote to the history of aviation . " " I record this trivia , " he insists , " not to try to regain my forever-lost feet-notehood but to try to recall the spirit of the early days of aviation . " Wrong . He records it in order to brag . Bragging is Mr. Vidal ' s long suit ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words he ' s coined , to explain which writers ' reputations he ' s helped to establish by writing favorable reviews . He also likes to dither on about his dreadful novels and plays , which he talks about as if they were classics . Mr. Vidal brags , too , about his illustrious antecedents : his grand-dad the senator , his father the FDR underling , his cousin Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . A sometime Senate candidate , Mr. Vidal appears to regard himself as a disenfranchised member of America ' s ruling classes . Indeed , much of his hostility toward America seems to derive from the fact that its destiny is controlled by others . All in all , " At Home " is Mr. Vidal ' s weakest collection . His wit too often feels strained , his snide volleys formulaic ; most of his bons mots , ragged from overuse , fail to shock or to sparkle . There ' s not a single idea , observation or irony in this book that readers of its predecessors won ' t recognize . Occasionally , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality . Can it be that Mr. Vidal  --  who turns 64 this year  --  is softening as he nears old age ?  --  - Mr. Bawer is a literary critic living in New York.
