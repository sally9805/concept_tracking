" Maryland State Police reported one pound cocaine seizure concealed in stuffed teddy bear . Two teddy bears discovered in vehicle , one heavier than the other . Velcro closure on heavier bear opened and cocaine discovered. " // It was one more sign of the resourcefulness with which drug distributors are spreading their merchandise beyond the borders to the American heartland in what has become a vast , intricate and growing interstate commerce in illegal drugs . Whether stuffed in teddy bears or buried in truckloads of refrigerated but potentially very smelly fish , whether mailed in Federal Express packages or merely tossed into the trunks of cars , cocaine , crack , marijuana and heroin are making their way to retail markets on airplanes , automobiles , trucks , boats , buses and trains all across the nation . Drugs are found on anything that moves. // The barons of the Medellin drug cartel , who have masterminded the flow of cocaine into the United States , are believed to be gaining more and more control over its traffic within this country . American intelligence data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places like Houston and Miami , Denver and Oklahoma City. // Law-enforcement officials , frustrated by what they acknowledge is a losing battle to stop illegal drugs at the borders , are placing new emphasis on their next line of defense : highways and other domestic drug conduits . <> <> Boats and Mobile Homes // From a squat brick building under tight security at the El Paso Intelligence Center , or EPIC , composed of officials from the Drug Enforcement Adminstration and nine other Federal agencies , workers at computer consoles take reports from police agencies across the country about drug movement on highways . This is an added responsibility for EPIC , a clearinghouse for tactical information on global trafficking that has now been enlisted in the effort to break down the new interstate commerce in drugs. // Working with Operation Pipeline , a Federal highway surveillance effort , officials here communicate around the clock with their counterparts in dozens of state police forces about narcotics on major highways . They transmit wire reports , often based on tips from informers , on how and where drugs are moving. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabled details on a pickup truck traveling from one state to another on a clockwork schedule , towing a boat with 12 kilograms of cocaine hidden inside . The interstate travels of a mobile home and a smuggler using several limousines to transport cocaine and marijuana were also reported in the cable . These drug couriers , the authorities said , have yet to be caught. // Despite such intensified efforts , law-enforcement officials are not optimistic . As hard as it is to catch drug traffickers at the border , it is even tougher when they reach the interior , blending in with families on vacation and truckers hauling all sorts of legitimate loads. // " The last line of defense we have is the highway , " said Warren Henderson , the state and local training coordinator at EPIC . " Once it gets past that line , the odds are probably one in a million of getting an entire load of dope off the street . " <> <> The Highway <> Elusive Smugglers And New Routes // A map of the major drug routes could just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the United States , most illegal drugs travel by car and truck. // Sometimes vehicles carry drugs from Mexico into Texas , New Mexico , Arizona or California and drive them directly to dealers . Even if they enter the country by air or sea , more often than not they are loaded on cars or trucks , usually near the border . Often , regardless of where they enter , they are transported to a hub like New York or Los Angeles , repackaged and driven by car or truck to their final destinations. // Americans spend billions on drugs each year . The state police , who patrol the Interstate highways , seize only a small fraction of that . In 1988 , the 41 state police agencies that gave statistics to Operation Pipeline reported seizures of 35 , 947 kilograms of marijuana , 4 , 055 kilograms of cocaine and 10. 6 kilograms of heroin . The cocaine would have a wholesale price of $45 million to $138 million , depending on purity and market conditions. // The authorities are particularly concerned about cocaine because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly addictive form of crack . And they are not claiming great success . <> <> ' We ' re Not Touching the Traffic ' // " We ' re not bragging for a minute , " said Sgt. Roy Herren , who supervises the intelligence section of the Missouri Highway Patrol . " We know we ' re not touching the traffic. " // Once it was thought that crack , the crystalline and smokable form of cocaine , was so easy to manufacture locally that it was not being moved long distances . But apparently some drug operators are beginning to keep tighter control over the profits . As recently as 1986 , there were no reported seizures of crack on highways ; in the first four months of 1989 , the 41 states reported seizing 12. 8 kilograms on the highways. // Troopers in several states have spotted trailer trucks hauling large loads of drugs , but the couriers ' main strategy is to be unpredictable : to carry drugs in refrigerated fish trucks , for instance , or in empty trailer trucks with drug compartments in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unpredictable , so are the routes . Interstate 75 , which goes from southern Florida through Atlanta and Cincinnati and northern Michigan to Canada , has seen far more narcotics seizures in the first half of 1989 than in the same period in 1988 . This could reflect more drug traffic or stepped-up law enforcement or both . Most of the seizures occurred in Georgia . Some traffickers seem to be avoiding the I-95 corridor , long a favorite East Coast route , perhaps because of intensified police surveillance. // A similar decline in highway smuggling has occurred on Interstate 40 , from Southern California to North Carolina . To elude the police , smugglers are using diversionary tactics , like driving north from Arizona and east on Interstate 70 through Utah , Colorado and Kansas before dropping back to I-40 through Oklahoma to points east. // " Does Utah look like it ' s a major route to anyplace ? " Mr. Henderson asked . But at least 306 kilograms of cocaine were seized on highways in Utah last year , one of the largest totals among the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Cocaine Is ' Flour ' // The organizations that transport and distribute drugs in this country are as varied as the ways drugs move . But at the heart of the drug business are two products of technology : the telephone and the beeper . The life of a drug trafficker is a life of phone calls to set the times and places for meetings . Dealers drive from pay phone to pay phone to avoid detection. // The multimillion-dollar cocaine smuggling ring headed by Miguel Pacheco-Valdez , arrested on drug trafficking charges in Phoenix last year , seemed to be run largely by telephone , through calls made from Arizona , New Mexico , California , Oregon , Utah , Washington and British Columbia . Undercover agents watched traffickers make their contacts from pay phones outside a Circle K convenience store and later from a Bob ' s Big Boy restaurant . Between phone calls , the traffickers would try to keep from being followed . They would travel at high speeds for a while , then slow down and turn into quiet neighborhoods . <> <> ' Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee this month , Max Mermelstein , a convicted drug dealer , said the new cocaine network " is predicated on communication and getting in contact with the people the cocaine is going to be given to and who the money is going to be received from. " // The dealer , who is now a protected Government witness and uses a different name , added : " None of because of interception of the line . They use pay phones , and they ' re constantly changing pay phones . Everybody walks around with a beeper ; they ' re called from a pay phone , and they return the call from the pay phone. " // Nevertheless , investigators have managed to listen in on many calls from public phones. // They tapped one conversation in which Jose S. Valdez , identified as key figure in the Pacheco-Valdez ring , was trying to find a pilot . Calling from Apache Junction , Ariz . , Mr. Valdez told a man called Octavio that he needed five planeloads of drugs from Mexico and would pay him $100 , 000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles or so inside Mexico , and the pilot was told he could fly two loads a day and " make a half a million fast , " according to an affidavit from a Federal narcotics agent . Octavio told Mr. Valdez that he was going to Virginia for three months and would be unavailable , but that his partner might be interested. // Another trafficker in the organization , in a phone call from Portland , Ore. , said it was important that the ring sell legitimate items once in a while ; this would disguise its activities and provide cover for its members if they were arrested . " Like I told you , " he said , " if ever we have the misfortune , at least we can say I used to sell salmon , shrimp and everything like that. " // The traffickers routinely spoke in code . Cocaine was " white dresses , " " white trees , " " little white cars , " " flour , " " oranges " or " ice cream . " Marijuana was " green carpet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " tires " or " black grapes . " <> <> The Connections <> From Colombia To Oklahoma // Informers have told law-enforcement officials that the Medellin smugglers of Colombia have placed one overlord in the United States to supervise cocaine traffic . Under him are said to be regional chiefs in Miami , Houston , New York and Los Angeles . Federal agents or local police detectives will not say if they have learned who these chiefs are. // In one recent case , a lower-level lieutenant , Rodrigo Chegwin-Vergana , was convicted of working with the cartel in bringing cocaine into Oklahoma . Mr. Chegwin-Vergana is said to have guided the movements of more than 50 boat and airplane loads of several hundred kilograms each . He arranged the planes and boats , the unloading crews and the landing or docking sites . A pilot flew cocaine from Colombia directly to the False River area of Louisiana , and from there it was distributed to Oklahoma , Texas , Florida and elsewhere. // In another case involving Colombia ' s Oklahoma connection , a group of Colombians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the organization either drove it or carried it on commercial airlines to Oklahoma City , where it was redistributed in quantities of an ounce or more . <> <> ' Small-Town Associations ' // Why Oklahoma ? There is demand there , but just as important , the connection is in place . This is as important to the local operators as it is to the cartels. // " Small-town associations " are the basis for cocaine distribution in South Dakota , said Phillip N. Hogen , the United States Attorney there . " To supply more than one-ounce quantities of cocaine , a distributor in South Dakota must have a contact in a metropolitan area , " he said in a report to the Justice Department. // A dealer in Aberdeen , S.D. , for example , was caught receiving a supply of cocaine from his regional center in Denver - which sent it by United Parcel Service . Gordon R. Edgecomb , a convicted smuggler , used the mail until a package containing $25 , 000 in cash was lost . From then on , he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine runners are occasionally caught through their own miscalculations as they drive long distances , often nonstop , from one region to another . They may be caught speeding or fall asleep at the wheel and lose control. // When one state trooper in the South stopped a car for speeding , a passenger got out and recited what seemed to be the only English he knew : " I don ' t have the cocaine . I don ' t have the cocaine. " // The trooper found 20 to 30 kilograms of cocaine hidden behind the back seat . <> <> Searches and Seizures // Under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , police officers may not search vehicles unless they have a good reason to believe they will find illegal drugs or weapons . If they do so without consent , anything they seize can not be used as evidence . Surprisingly , however , many smugglers consent to being searched. // " I don ' t know why they do it , " said Major O. L. Sanderson , field operations officer of the Wyoming Highway Patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal procedures. " // But the searches do pay off . In Missouri recently , a drug trafficker was driving a van 68 miles an hour in a 55 m. p. h. zone . A trooper pulled him over and , on a hunch , asked if he could search the back of the van . The result was one of the largest cocaine seizures on a highway : 500 kilograms stuffed in cardboard boxes . <> <> The Outlook <> Little Optimism On the Battle Lines // Drug policy experts see the new interstate commerce in drugs as a measure of how deeply narcotics have permeated American society. // Yet even with stepped-up law enforcement , they say , little can be done to solve the problem quickly . Even trying to close off the borders or amending the Constitution to allow routine searches of cars and truck would pose huge practical problems , to say nothing of costs. // Larry L. Orton , the special agent in charge of the El Paso Intelligence Center , acknowledges that concentrating on the circuitous pathways of drug traffickers is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the answer , " he said . " There are more ways to bring the drugs into the country than we have the ability or where-withal to stop . You can ' t just go willy-nilly stopping people in the country . The answer is not interdiction , but combining law enforcement and reducing demand. " // Asked what can be done about the interstate travel of drugs , M. Douglas Anglin , director of the Drug Abuse Research Group at the University of California at Los Angeles , replied : // " We need a urine test for coars . That ' s what we need.
