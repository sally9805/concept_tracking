The victory was impressive . The winning party picked up eight seats across the nation , making historic breakthroughs in the South that seemed to suggest a continuing realignment of regional political loyalties . This was not the smashing Democratic coup in Senate races ; it was the Republicans ' success in slashing the Democrats ' domination of the nation 's gubernatorial mansions from a count of 34 to 16 to just 26 to 24 . In an otherwise cloudy Election Day for the G.O.P. , Republican strategists justifiably flaunted this silver lining . <P> Republicans will now govern the Sunbelt 's three largest states : California , Texas and Florida . For the first time since Reconstruction , Alabama will have a Republican Governor , and for only the second time in this century , a Republican will lead South Carolina . The G.O.P. captured governorships being vacated by Democrats in Maine , Florida , South Carolina , Alabama , Kansas , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Arizona and New Mexico . In Wisconsin , Republican Challenger Tommy Thompson ousted incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl . Democrats managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee and Pennsylvania . <P> But the results did not constitute the sweeping trend toward a realignment of regional politics that Republicans had sought . Defying tidy analysis , eleven states chose candidates from opposing parties for Senator and Governor . Unlike the Senate contests , the Governors ' races found the Democrats far more vulnerable : 27 of 36 seats at stake had been held by Democrats . Yet in the West , where eight Democratic executive mansions were at risk , Republicans managed a net gain of only one . <P> The Republican gains could provide the party with significant organizational strength for the 1988 presidential campaigns . But as New Hampshire Republican Governor John Sununu notes , " The easiest way to build up party structure is to hold the statehouses . " And at this more basic level , Democrats picked up about 180 state legislative seats nationally , and will apparently control both chambers of the legislatures in 27 states , one more than at present . Republicans will dominate both houses in just nine states , two fewer than before . <P> Many gubernatorial races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalties . Texas Republican Bill Clements won back his office from Mark White , the Democrat who had defeated him four years ago . Texas , moreover , suffers heavily from depressed oil prices , and White had the courage  --  some might say the foolhardiness  --  to raise taxes twice in an attempt to keep his state solvent . Alabama 's Democrats went through such a bloodletting to determine the winner of their primary that Republican Guy Hunt benefited from the fratricide.
