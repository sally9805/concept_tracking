Primary night , California . June 7 , 1988 . George Bush eases into a hotel armchair for an interview with Tom Brokaw . Suddenly a burly , bearded figure bounds across the room and , without a word , yanks an errant hair from the vice-presidential eyebrow . " That hurt , " winces Bush as a grinning Roger Ailes leaves the room , satisfied that he has put his finishing touch on the scene . <P> From early 1986 , when George Bush set out on his long trek toward the Oval Office , Roger Ailes has been struggling to make more than just cosmetic changes in the Vice President . Ailes , 48 , is the legendary dark prince of political advertising , the Republican consultant who helped engineer Richard Nixon 's resurrection in 1968 and who scripted Ronald Reagan 's second-debate comeback against Walter Mondale in 1984 . This time Ailes has been the unseen hand behind Bush 's best moments : the " Pierre " put-down of former Delaware Governor Pete du Pont in a debate last October , the hard-hitting anti-Dole advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pummeling of CBS 's Dan Rather last January . <P> But the fall campaign presents Ailes with his most formidable challenge . The Vice President has been trailing Michael Dukakis by double digits in polls , and his negative ratings with voters have approached Jesse Jackson 's . Moreover , Bush fights some of Ailes ' attempts to improve his public presence . Ailes wants Bush to rehearse more and stick to his carefully prepared texts ; Bush waves away much of this as inconsequential . Even when Bush does follow the Ailes regimen , he often seems to be his own worst enemy . He frequently comes across as a good-natured Mr. Maladroit , garbling his syntax , muddling his ideas and tripping over his applause lines . <P> Ailes ' involvement has been crucial to Bush 's candidacy . When Bush arrived in New Hampshire reeling from a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses , Ailes labored all night over the television ad that quashed Robert Dole 's insurgent campaign . Known as the " Senator Straddle " commercial , the blunt spot asserted that Dole had waffled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ailes also prepped Bush for the Showdown at Black Rock . Foreseeing that the CBS Evening News interview would be an ambush , Ailes provided Bush with a riposte to an aggressive Dan Rather : " It 's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran . How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York ? " The tactic illustrates an Ailes axiom : when attacked , hit back so hard your opponent rues the day he got nasty . <P> Ailes comes across as the Ernest Hemingway of consultants . Swaggering and corpulent ( 5 ft. 10 in. and 243 lbs. ) , with a white goatee , he plays the woolly renegade to what he calls " the coat-and-tie boys " who surround Bush . He is gargantuan in his appetites  --  for food , amusement , combat and attention . In a fight with two leather-jacket types in a Houston hotel lobby in 1984 , he broke one man 's wrist and tossed the other man into the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had repaired a bowed table in Bush campaign offices , Ailes walked into a roomful of aides , grabbed the conference table and flipped it over . He nurtures his pugnacious image as carefully . " If people know you 'll go to any lengths for your client , they 're less likely to play games with you , " he says .
