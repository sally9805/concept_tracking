Bonfires and brawls once again choked the streets of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa . Ever since China invaded the mountainous region in 1950 , the Tibetans have periodically erupted in violent protest against Communist rule . Last week , after three days of rioting , Chinese authorities imposed martial law and troops armed with automatic weapons ringed the city to quell the unrest . At least 30 people were believed killed and more than 100 were wounded in the ensuing melee . <P> From India , the Tibetan government-in-exile condemned the Chinese crackdown and said it feared the Communists would use the riots " as an excuse to resort to more repressive methods . " But the bloodshed may increase international pressure on Beijing to start negotiations with the Tibetans . The Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 , has accused the Chinese of stalling on proposed talks to make fiercely independent Tibet a self-governing entity " in association " with the People 's Republic .                   @ @
