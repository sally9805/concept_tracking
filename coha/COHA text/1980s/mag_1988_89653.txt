Ten thousand Swedes Ran through the weeds Chased by one Norwegian  --  ANONYMOUS // The funny thing  --  and here funny means strange or demented , as in " Bucko , you 've got some funny ideas about sportsmanship "  --  was that even as the Swedes were clinching their first world hockey championship in 25 years last April , in Vienna , even as they were dazzling their fans and frustrating their Canadian opponents with an exhibition of passing , skating and shooting that turned this medal-round game into a 9-0 rout , some of the Canadian players were calling them " Chicken Swedes . " // In the corners , before face-offs , along the boards , a number of players on the Canadian team  --  ignoring the scoreboard  --  hissed idiotically : " Chicken Swede , Chicken Swede . " The inapt use of that familiar North American hockey refrain was more a testament to the mentality that permeates the sport on this side of the Atlantic than to any flaw in the Swedish character . The Swedes answered the Canadians with picturesque goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship that , by most accounts , marked the biggest triumph in Swedish hockey history . ( Sweden had won the world title on three previous occasions , but in 1962. the last time it had done so , neither the Soviets nor the Czechoslovakians had competed in the championships . In ' 53 and ' 57 , neither the U.S. nor Canada participated . All those teams were present in Vienna . ) They were n't going to let a few Canadian numbskulls ruin it . Besides , it was nothing they had n't heard before . Over and over again . // " It 's a myth , " says Sweden 's national team coach , Tommy Sandlin . " But every time we play against the U.S. or Canada , it 's ' Chicken Swede . ' Every time . " He pauses and smiles tolerantly . " And our jerseys are yellow , too . " // Someday , those of us who live in the New World may get over the fact that Swedish hockey players are not tough in the conventional and , may we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fight . They usually will not even fight back when they are mugged within the tight confines of an NHL rink , where the ice is 15 feet narrower than it is on the 100-foot-wide international rinks such as the one on which hockey will be played at the Calgary Olympics . Nor do the Swedes put much stock in " winning the little battles along the boards , " which North American coaches hold so dear . Their bodychecking is too infrequent to be called pathetic ; they hardly know the meaning of aggressive forechecking , to say nothing of dumping the puck in and digging it out of the corners ; and that dearest of American beliefs  --  that winning is " the only thing "  --  is anathema at all levels of Swedish hockey , where sportsmanship is actually revered . // Like we said , Chicken Swedes . // How , then , can this country , with a population of only eight million , compete on a more or less equal basis with those far more populous  --  not to mention macho  --  hockey powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. ? How is it that these Scandinavian pussycats are viewed as the best bet to knock off the favored and purportedly prepotent Soviets for the gold ? " We are a small country and have not so many good players , " says Sandlin , overstating his case just a little . " We can never be as well prepared and conditioned as the Russians , or as tough as the North Americans . So we must pick a team that will be the most clever . That is the Swedish style . " There 's an expression for that on this side of the Atlantic , although we have n't heard it used much in a hockey context : brains over brawn. // To make one thing perfectly clear : The Swedes play wonderful hockey . It 's not just the way they skate , as if gliding on air ; it 's more than their magical passing and unselfish teamwork . Their whole approach to the game is a marvel , and it is summed up by Sandlin in a single phrase : " The players are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques are enlightened , particularly in the way coaches teach young players . And while the Swedes stress excellence , their attitude toward winning and losing is a model of perspective . For weekly examples of this , tune into the pro tennis circuit sometime and compare , say , Stefan Edberg 's manner in defeat to that of America 's own Johnny Mac , who , not incidentally , is a New York Rangers fan . In Sweden they have n't lost sight of one simple fact : Sports are games , and games  --  yes , even hockey  --  are for play . // " The attitude is different here , " says Thomas Gradin , who played nine seasons in the NHL , scoring more than 200 goals for Vancouver and Boston , before returning to Stockholm this season to rejoin the AIK club . " Hockey is n't life . In Canada , it 's life . Players quit school to play hockey . They 're traded from one city to another . And when they stop playing , a lot of them do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hockey , they 've been away from life . " // Hockey players in Sweden , even the best ones , are never " away from life " for long , because they either hold jobs or go to school . Real jobs , not as in the Soviet Union , where the hockey players are given army rank so that they can pretend they 're amateurs . ( Major Tretiak , indeed ! ) Humdrum everyday jobs . Gradin is an administrator in the Swedish Ice Hockey Federation , but most of the players work outside hockey . Gradin 's brother , Peter , an AIK teammate , is a policeman . Others have jobs in banking and retailing . Some go to universities . " Sports in Sweden is very popular , " says Hakan Sdergren , one of the top players on the national team and an insurance agent . " But as far as the people are concerned , it is n't work . It should n't be the way you support your family . There 's a lot of jealousy here . In Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he great . ' In Sweden , they say , ' Sdergren makes how much ? Is he worth it ? ' " // Sdergren made the equivalent of about $50,000 playing hockey for Djurgardens and for the national team last year , which was one of the highest hockey incomes in Sweden . But even that was less than it seemed , for most of it went straight to the socialist government , which taxes incomes of more than $31,000 at a rate as high as 75% . Salaries for players in the Elite league average the equivalent of $16,000 a year  --  the price of a bottom-of-the-line Volvo  --  and rookie wages start as low as $500 a month . The players enjoy a few perks , of course . For one , clubs help players get apartments in Stockholm , where finding housing can be very tough . And the clubs use their influence to get jobs with a future for their young signees. // Once hired , though , the players are treated , and paid , the same as any other employee . Sdergren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for practice . Consequently , he 's paid less than his fellow insurance agents . // And since all the players have regular jobs , there are no in-season player trades among teams . No midseason transfers from Stockholm to Skelleftea . Each club in the 12-team Elitserien is pretty much set from the beginning of the season to the end . Changes are made only during the summer . One benefit of this approach is that the relationship between the coach and his players is more that of mentor , not dictator , to his students . Indeed , Sandlin is nicknamed the Professor . One of the toughest adjustments Swedish players have to make when they come into the NHL is to the coaches , who sometimes assume an adversarial role and attempt to motivate players by yelling and screaming and threatening to send them to the minors . " You are thinking , ' What 's going on here ? ' " recalls Stefan Persson , a veteran of four Stanley Cup championship seasons with the New York Islanders and now a sportswear distributor in Sweden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard a coach raise his voice . " // As far as players supplementing their incomes with big-money endorsements , forget it . What little ancillary income there is goes not to the player but to the sports club to which he 's under contract . ( There are no player agents in Sweden , or this surely would be changed faster than you can say hg klubba  --  high-sticking . ) Mikael Andersson is a case in point . One of the national team 's leading scorers , Andersson made a magazine and newspaper advertisement for McDonald 's last summer . His club , Bjrklven , got a donation of some $8,000 out of the deal . Andersson 's cut ? A VIP card that entitles him to one free Big Mac a day . There 's a man who deserves a break today . // Small wonder , then , that it 's the dream of every young Swedish player to go to the NHL to play with  --  and against  --  the professionals . It 's his only chance at big money . So he yearns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swede to play in the NHL , who signed with the Detroit Red Wings in 1972 . To follow the lead of Borje Salming and Inge Hammarstrom , both of whom joined the Toronto Maple Leafs in ' 73 . It was Hammarstrom , or , more correctly , Maple Leaf owner Harold Ballard , who helped spread this " Chicken Swede " business when Ballard remarked demeaningly , " Hammarstrom could go into the corner with six eggs in his pockets and not break one of them . " // Hammarstrom probably could have . He was a stylish skater . More to the point was whether any Swede could have skated into the corner without having his skull cracked open . The first time Salming faced the Philadelphia Flyers , in his second NHL game , he was cross-checked and beat upon by Dave Schultz , who was in his nose-crunching heyday , then speared by Ed Van Impe . It was a strategy that , to some extent , goes on to this day . Intimidate the Chicken Swede . See what he 's made of . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden , the type of player who can be intimidated is not weeded out by the selection process , " says Anders Hedberg , who joined the Winnipeg Jets in 1974 and once had a 70-goal season in the World Hockey Association . " In North America , he will fall by the wayside very early . " // Thus , every Swede who turned pro was tested . Hedberg , Ulf Nilsson , Willy Lindstrom and the late Lars-Erik Sjoberg were highly skilled players who were subjected to such thuggery night after night that their Jets teammate , the great Bobby Hull , once sat out a game in protest . " None of the new players from Sweden gets tested the way we were 10 years ago . " recalls Hedberg , who 's now back in Stockholm working for Manufacturers Hanover Bank and serving as chief of scouting for the AIK club . " You had to be pretty determined to stay . " // But they did stay . And one after another , other top Swedish players followed  --  Kent Nilsson , Persson , Tomas Jonsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradin  --  and they were better prepared , mentally , for the base realities of life in the NHL . There are 24 Swedes in the league this year . They elevate the NHL by their presence , but the truth is it is not a forum in which the Swedes can showcase their skills . The rinks are too small and the selfless teamwork that they 're accustomed to is missing . Swedish players are not individualists . " There is so much team play when our players are young that we do not have superstars , " says Sandlin . " Other countries are faster and stronger and tougher . But to coordinate , to act as a team , I think the Swedes are best in the world . " // And now there is evidence that a new breed of player is coming to the NHL from Sweden  --  a bigger , tougher , meaner cat who can give as well as he gets . Tomas Sandstrom of the Rangers . Ulf Samuelsson of the Hartford Whalers . In time they may bury the Chicken Swede image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , after their NHL careers are over , they will return to their homeland with a sizable nest egg . " Sweden is a nice place to grow up and to grow old , " says Sdergren . " But when you 're in your prime and are one of the elite in your field  --  not just athletes , but artists and businessmen  --  it 's best to move away . " // One of the first places to be left behind is Kiruna . Surrounded by black , thousand-foot-high slag heaps  --  the residue of its iron mines  --  Kiruna is the place to grow up in Sweden if you want to be a hockey player . " It 's the cradle of ice hockey here , like Montreal in Canada , " says Andersson , one of three members of the Swedish Olympic Team who was raised in this town of 24,000 . But when they were old enough and good enough , they left . // In winter , the sun never gets above the horizon in Kiruna , which is almost 2 above the Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have commercial air service , and between November and February four to five hours of dusk is what passes for daylight . Snow is on the ground from October until April , and it 's May before the ice has thawed from the lakes . But the kids do n't skate on the lakes anymore . Not much , anyway . They play hockey in the new indoor arena . And if the ice there is unavailable , they can skate at the Matojarvi Rink , one of the oldest indoor ice facilities in Sweden . // Built in 1962 , Matojarvi is n't very old by North American standards , but then the sport of hockey did n't come to Sweden until 1920 . That was the first year ice hockey was played in the Olympics , in Antwerp , Belgium , and the Swedish Bandy Association ( bandy is a hockeylike game , and perhaps its progenitor ) , anxious to participate , fielded a makeshift team that finished fourth . At that time , North America was far ahead of the rest of the world in hockey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again finished fourth and lost to the U.S. and Canada by scores of 20-0 and 22-0 , respectively . ( Sweden won the silver medal in the ' 28 Games , when the U.S. was absent , the highest it has ever finished in Olympic hockey . ) It was a gulf that would not be bridged until the ' 50s. // The Swedish game was played outdoors back then , on community rinks , on lakes , in open-air stadiums . Spectators would fuel themselves against the cold by taking hits from bottles of vodka or aquavit hidden in their briefcases . That practice did n't end when the Matojarvi Rink was built . " This rink is like a deep freeze , " says Mikael Lundstrm , the coach of the local sports club , Kiruna AIF . " The last time that Kiruna had a team in the Elite league , in 1973 , it was so cold in here for the playoffs that the keys on the organ froze . When the organist tried to play , the sounds it made were very strange , not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ had been borrowed from the church . " // Salming came from Kiruna . He lived across the street from the Matojarvi Rink , learned the game there and is still the local hockey legend  --  although Peter Lindmark , the goalie on the national and Olympic teams , runs a close second . Now that a new arena has been built ( today there are 200 indoor rinks in Sweden , 50 more than there were five years ago ) , Matojarvi is outdated . The pipes that used to make artificial ice have been ripped out , and the curved wooden roof covers nothing but a naked cement floor . But in winter , in Kiruna , who needs artificial ice ? It is cold enough by the end of October that the cement floor can be flooded and the ice frozen naturally , giving the kids a second covered surface on which to play and practice . Winters are long and the youngsters take advantage of it . " The skating ability of the young players is better up here , " says Lundstrm . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockholm , a more honest way , with more skating and passing and shooting and not so much cleverness . But it 's very difficult to get the younger players to stay . " // There 's no draft of 18-year-old hockey players in Sweden . They 're free to play for whoever is interested in them . When you are from Kiruna  --  whose closest rival is 320 kilometers away and whose longest road trip is 900 kilometers by train  --  well , Stockholm ( or Bjrklven or Lulea ) looks pretty good . So , as soon as they are good enough to play senior-level hockey , the best Kirunans leave . And those long dark hours of winter become a fond but distant memory of youth . // There are only 60,000 kids between seven and 15 years old playing hockey in Sweden . ( The U.S. has 160,000 players in that age group . ) Yet from this base a disproportionate number of the world 's best hockey players are developed . It 's a testament to Swedish coaching . " The only way we can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every player and educate him technically , " says Claes-Goran Wallin , an official of the Swedish Ice Hockey Federation . " The ordinary players have to make good . In your country there are so many talented players you can afford to lose the ordinary ones . " // That 's doubtful . But the Swedes , clearly , have been able to overcome the handicap of a smaller talent pool . They play fewer games than their North American counterparts , practicing , instead , fundamental skills . At a recent clinic for eight-year-olds in a suburban Stockholm rink , for instance , 43 kids were using the ice at once . The coaches had set up portable boards along the blue lines to divide the 200-by-100-foot surface into three separate rinks of 100 by 67 feet . There were six different goals to shoot at , two of them only 2 feet by 18 inches ( a regulation goal is 4 by 6 feet ) . In one section the kids were passing back and forth over sticks that had been randomly strewn on the ice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third they were just playing shinny . " You do n't have to win games when you 're seven , eight or nine , " says Wallin . " What 's important is that coaches look ahead to the long plan so that their players are winning games when they 're 27 , 28 or 29. " // The long plan includes teaching young players the Swedish style of skating , which is different  --  faster and smoother  --  from that favored by North Americans . Americans skate , for the most part , with a wide base . They push off with their inside edges at about a 45-degree angle ; the result is short , powerful strides  --  chop , chop , chop  --  that are generated by the groin and the inner thigh muscles . In Sweden the feet start closer together . As the skaters stride , they turn their ankles and push straight back , a thrust that depends , not on the groin muscles but on the more powerful quadriceps and buttock muscles . The weight is then shifted to the outside edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside edge during the thrust . // " This technique we learned from the Czechoslovakians , " says Arne Stromberg. who has been called " the father of Swedish hockey " and coached the national team from 1960 through ' 71 . " We are now teaching our players to skate only on the inside edges when they are in tight to the goal , as the North Americans do . It gives them greater stability when they are checked . " // This sort of technical training is virtually ignored at all but the highest levels of hockey in North America . In Sweden , where 4,000 coaches voluntarily attended clinics this year , it 's fundamental for players of all ages . When youngsters reach 13 or so , they begin to practice teamwork . Until that time they have worked primarily on individual skills like skating , stick-handling and passing . They are put into five-man units  --  one line , one set of defensemen  --  and each unit plays together all the time . In such a system it 's not so important who scores a goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Deep down , it 's the Swedish mentality , " says Sdergren . " Everything equal . The passing means as much as the scoring . " // " We are a socialist country , " says Sandlin , " and players and people want to be equal to each other . It 's very , very important to understand we 're different people from Americans . " // There are problems with such selflessness . " I grew up being taught that when you practiced a two-on-none against the goalie , you have to pass all the way , " says Gradin . " If you shot , the coach would say , ' Here , you have a friend , too . Pass to him . ' The killer instinct to drive for the net and do it yourself is n't there . " // Most Swedes freely admit they do n't shoot enough . They do so in the manner one might admit to , say , a weakness for chocolate . They like to pass . They see nothing particularly harmful in overpassing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . To shoot the ball  --  or puck  --  is to give it away . " I remember Canadian coaches coming over in 1957 and saying , you pass too much when you 're in the shooting area , " recalls Strmberg . " This has been a sickness for a very long time . " // Still , it 's a sickness that blends very well with the Swedish hockey philosophy . " The Swedish style is being patient , thinking defensively , keeping the puck on your own team and waiting for a mistake , " says Sdergren . " When you see your chance , you counterattack . We won a world championship that way . " // The Swedish style was n't always so conservative . But a 10-year period , stretching from 1977 to ' 86 , in which the Swedes played the Soviets 56 times without a win , losing 54 games and tying two , convinced Sandlin , who was coach of the national team in 1978-80 and took the job again in 1985 , that a tactical change was in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to beat them ? ' " says Sandlin . " I do n't want to beat the Russians if I have to be like them to beat them . Your Vince Lombardi said to win is everything , but this is not at all the way we think . I do n't want my players to eat anabolic steroids like the Russians and Czechs . I do n't want them to practice 1,500 hours a year like the Russians , or 1.300 hours a year like the Czechs . You must have other interests . I want 600 to 700 hours of practice , and we will try to win with that . The quality of life must be better than the quality of sport . " // So Sandlin started with a given : The Soviets would be stronger , better conditioned and faster . To compete , he decided , the Swedes had to slow the tempo down . " Delayed offense , reinforced defense " is what he calls the concept . // It works like this : Unless the Swedes have a clear breakaway , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the puck , they do n't forecheck to get it back . Rather , they retreat to the neutral zone , all three forwards clogging the middle of the ice by skating intricate weaving patterns , forcing the Soviets to advance , more or less unhindered , along the boards . " We 'll let the other team have certain areas of the ice we do n't consider dangerous , and we 'll outman them in the critical areas , " says Sandlin . " It 's very frustrating to the Russians , whose offense is based on setting up two-on-ones and three-on-two situations . " // The more frustrated a team is , the more likely it will be to lose patience and make an ill-advised pass or gamble . When that happens , the Swedes want to be in position to pounce on the opening and create a scoring chance . It 's a strategy that is strikingly similar to the way Sweden 's top men play tennis  --  Mats Wilander , Kent Carlsson , Anders Jarryd . Counterpunch  --  some say bore  --  you into submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Swedes have played the Soviets six times and have two wins , two losses and two ties . " We know now we can beat them , " says Sdergren . ' The mental thing is behind us . We 've lost our fear for the big teams . " // It is Sunday night in Stockholm . Hockey night at Johanneshov Isstadion , the 10,266-seat arena in which AIK and Djurgardens play their home games . For now , anyway . Next year those teams will move next door to the huge domed stadium that 's under construction ; it will be the site of the 1989 world championships . // Because tonight 's game features the two Stockholm-based teams , AIK and Djurgardens , it 's a near sellout . This is n't typical of Swedish hockey . Many Elite games attract only a few thousand spectators , lending credence to the NHL theory that it 's violence that sells the seats . It is also true , however , that the best Swedish players are in North America , and the Swedish fans , who follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big game for so early in the season , and the usual Scandinavian reserve is absent . Mayhem is in the air . At one end of the arena a special section is cordoned off for the most rabid AIK fans , who are called the Black Army . The section where they sit is known as Ape Mountain . The Black Army has been known to break windows and start fights after games . At the other end of the arena another section is reserved for the Djurgardens fans , a less ornery bunch , who have nicknamed themselves the Blue Saints . // These two sections are on their feet the whole game , trading insults . They are very much part of the show . When a Djurgardens player is penalized for charging  --  a rarely seen foul in Swedish hockey  --  Ape Mountain erupts : " That 's the place you belong , you little pissant ! " // After Djurgardens scores the first goal , the Black Army vengefully chants : " Now you 're going to die ! Now you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ugliest thing in the whole city . You look like apes in a box . " // But when AIK fails to score , the Black Army quiets down . Now it is the Blue Saints ' turn : " You 're only singing when you 're ahead . What 's wrong ? Why do n't you sing ? " // To which Ape Mountain responds : " You 're only running after the game . What 's wrong ? Why do n't you show up ? " ( This is an invitation to rumble , which explains why , at the conclusion of the game , the Djurgardens fans are asked to use one subway station and the AIK fans to use another. ) // So even the Swedes call each other Chicken Swedes . More unseemliness develops during the game when the captain of the AIK team calls time , skates across the ice to the public address system and grabs the microphone . " We found a stone on the ice , " he says , holding up the offending object . " Do n't ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unchastened , the Black Army points across the area to the Blue Saints : " You did it , you did it . " // It 's the opposite of an NHL game . The violence is all in the stands . On the ice , the game is very Swedish . The two teams play a similar style  --  cautious , defensive . They 're a pair of counterpunchers waiting for an opening . There are few scoring chances , but when one does occur , it is a good one . Djurgardens wins , the players shake hands , and Ape Mountain disperses , grumbling . // As of today we have very lively discussions about what should be the Swedish style . How can we make it better ? " Gradin says after the game . " Sandlin tells the coaches , " We have to be more aggressive . ' But they raise their hands when he says this and remind him , ' Yes , but you did n't play this way in the world championship . You did n't play this way in the Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , and not as I do . ' " // Swedish hockey is an open forum , a little of this , a little of that , ever-changing and debated . The Swedes have borrowed from the Czechs , Soviets and Canadians ; they have borrowed from soccer and bandy . Perhaps even from tennis . Swedish hockey is the thinking man 's approach to quite a fun game . Come to think of it , it may be time we learned to borrow from them .
