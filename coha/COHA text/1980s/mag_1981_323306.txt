Cuisinart vs . Robot-Coupe <P> " Tell her she 's the best by giving her the best food processor you can buy . " That was the Mother 's Day message to devoted husbands in an ad campaign that climaxed last week for the Cuisinart , the mechanical marvel that slices , dices , grinds and grates to produce treats ranging from pat to peanut butter . Cuisinarts , Inc. of Greenwich , Conn. , which sells processors of various sizes , priced from $100 to $260 , had good reason to launch the commercial blitz . Its status as the Cadillac of kitchen cutters is being seriously challenged by Robot-Coupe , the French firm whose founder , Pierre Verdun , invented the machines in 1963 . <P> Food processors became a favorite tool of American gourmets after Carl Sontheimer , 67 , a portly retired electron ics engineer from Connecticut , saw them at a French housewares show in 1971 . Sontheimer soon signed an agreement with the manufacturer , Robot-Coupe , to market the processors in the U.S. under the trade name Cuisinart . Food mavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifique , and sales took off . <P> But in 1977 , according to Sontheimer , trouble began . He claims that he was forced to reject more than 15% of 12,000 machines shipped from France because they were defective . Recalls Sontheimer : " It was a major disaster , and by then I 'd really had it . Robot-Coupe was not innovative , and their quality control was low . " He struck a deal with a Japanese manufacturer to produce new mod els of the Cuisinart to augment his line , and before long he was selling more Japanese than French processors . Out raged executives at Robot-Coupe charged that Sontheimer was no longer promoting their models , and last year they severed his French connection . <P> Robot-Coupe recruited Alvin Finesman , 51 , who until 1979 had been the Cuisinart marketing director in the U.S. , to lead its American offensive . Finesman , a wiry backslapper and pure salesman who at 13 peddled cigars in bars and brothels in Ohio , took up his campaign with gusto . Some early magazine ads for the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced Robo-Coop . ( It used to be pronounced Cuisinart . ) " <P> Sontheimer sued Robot-Coupe , charging that the firm was trying to fool the public into thinking that Cuisinart had changed its name . A court enjoined Robot-Coupe from continuing that particular ad , so Finesman 's campaign now reads : " There are many food processors made in Japan . The original is still made in France . " Retailers report that the Robot-Coupe is selling well but is still far behind the the Cuisinart . <P> Which of the food processors is better ? The Cuisinart has a larger opening for feeding food into the machine , but Robot-Coupe offers models with slightly more powerful motors . Culinary experts are divided in their loyalties , and many agree with Russell Reitz , manager of Cook 's Mart in Chicago , which offers its customers both : " There is virtually no difference in performance or price be tween the two processors .
