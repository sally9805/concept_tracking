There were better weeks than last for canceling a sport . Could n't strikes be timed to follow a good drug bust , or any of the disgraces that once were rare intrusions in the sports pages but now are staples ? Russell Baker has noticed that sportswriters hardly ever gush anymore , but the problem has to do with all the grim details in the piece . The cranky voices of lawyers and agents are growing as familiar as Vin Scully 's . They argue over dreary words . This time arbitration , last time compensation . When do they get to calcification ? <P> But the too frequent mood of misery was absent last week , and so it may not be a complete coincidence that baseball 's strike was short-lived . Over an amazing prestrike weekend , baseball 's Rod Carew , Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden , football 's Joe Namath , O.J. Simpson and Roger Staubach , a runner named Steve Cram , a tennis player named Boris Becker and an amateur golfer named Scott Verplank had got in the first word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games : excellence . On dark occasions in sports , the President and both houses of Congress can vouch for this inessential industry as an essential reverie , and still the public may have a little difficulty recalling what 's so lyrical about sweating . This time the memories were fresh and bright . <P> Imagine two young men debuting in the same baseball season , winning the Rookie of the Year awards for the American and National Leagues , toiling 19 summers in and out of the sun , and arriving at the definitive milestone of their positions on the same afternoon . For a pitcher , that means 300 victories , in the 116-year history of baseball the province of just 17 men , now including Seaver , 40 . Leading up to the moment , he acted cool and professional . Only afterward would he admit , " It was like I was pitching my first major league game . " The morning before , he was sitting beside his father Charles in the Chicago White Sox dugout at Yankee Stadium , just as so many years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sat together in ball parks . Reversing and updating the dialogue , Seaver said , " Look over at the batting cage , dad . There 's Yogi Berra 's son . " <P> Once Charles Seaver was an amateur golfer of Walker Cup class renowned for his serenity under fire . His boy is quick to correct anyone who says he played golf the way Tom pitches : " I pitch the way he played golf . " Finding himself in New York now was another incredibility to Seaver . " Tom is really still a Met , " Mets First Baseman Keith Hernandez insisted the next day as Seaver 's former New York teammates bellied around a television set ( equitably enough , in Chicago ) . Baseball 's particular prodigy , Pitcher Dwight Gooden , 20 , had just won his eleventh consecutive game to break a club record that Seaver fashioned 16 years ago . " It 's especially great coming today , " said Gooden . " This is something I 'll always remember . " Seaver was about through beating the Yankees , 4-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he brushed by the family field box to reassure Daughter Annie , 9 . " Only three more outs to go , " he murmured . " Good , " she said happily , " then we can go home and go swimming . " He finished the game filled with delight .
