**28;296; Q. What do you think is the most important problem facing the United States over the next decade ? And what new ideas do you have for dealing with it ? <> // JACKSON . There ' s within this country a growing sense of insecurity within , the American people feeling unprotected . Many people are feeling unprotected by law , that the Justice Department is not committed to justice . There ' s been a cutback in this Administration on the enforcement of laws vital to the civil rights of American citizens . Women did not get an equal rights amendment passed . For blacks and Hispanics the Voting Rights Act has not been vigorously enforced . Workers are victims of plants closing without notice . Slave labor markets abroad undercut the American worker and there is the feeling that the American worker can ' t do anything about it , that when you ' re violated , you can ' t go to the Justice Department . So one of the first commitments that an American President must make is to adequately fund the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice comes from unenforced laws. // For example , if the Voting Rights Act was enforced in the South adequately and you could end the second primary in the 10 Deep South states , where 53 percent of all blacks live , and there is only one black college person out of 115 and no statewide officials 18 years later . Of course at that rate , it would take 190 years to achieve parity . But if the Voting Rights Act is enforced , that is Section 2 , which bans forms of discrimination ; if section 5 is enforced and registrars are accessible , and you end second primaries which keep black people , Hispanics , women and poor people from a securer justice , you ' ll get 12 to 20 black , Hispanic and female Congresspersons by next November . If that happens , we ' ll get our share of legislators and judges and other officials , that will trigger the passage of E.R.A. Women will all be protected in the South if the Voting Rights Act is enforced , and they are our natural allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house headed by a woman where there is no man , to enfranchise women is to protect the children . The women who go out into the workforce will then end right-to-work laws because you have the power to do so . Thus workers will get paid for their work . Most people who are poor are not on welfare . They ' re either too proud to apply for welfare or they otherwise work and don ' t get paid enough for their work. // **28;326; Q. So the key to ending this feeling of being unprotected , the first step is to enforce the Voting Rights Act and things will flow from that ? <> // A : Which empowers the poor . When you empower the poor they then have self-determination and they deal from the ability to protect themselves , so the poor in that instance do not need to be embellished . They need to be empowered . They don ' t need so much aid . You know , people need aid when trade is cut off . People need aid when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s what ' s most important now . Second to that is the need for peace . Peace must have justice as its content and its center . <> <> United States-Soviet Relations // **28;356; Q. How would you go about obtaining peace ? <> // A. Just as the first item of business for Eisenhower was to go to Korea and to risk the danger of being misunderstood , even risk failure , the risk for peace was worth it . The risk of bringing the boys back home was worth it . The boldness with which Kennedy went to Geneva to meet Khrushchev , or Nixon by going to China , or Carter by convening Camp David - we need an American President who will be glad to meet the head of the Soviet Union anywhere , any time , unconditionally but only agree conditionally . We must give the world an impression that we have a peace policy , though we have a military capability , and that we will not allow the hotline on the desk of the White House to go unused . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will not be a day after . When leaders talk together the tension is relieved . When they talk , they act . And when they act they change things . Only an agreement between the President of this country and the head of the Soviet Union will give them the security to then convince their constituencies to begin to roll back the arms buildup , so peace really begins in the mind of two leaders in this instance . <> <> The Federal Deficit // **28;386; Q. How serious is the growing Federal deficit and specifically what would you do to reduce it ? Would you raise taxes ? Cut domestic spending ? Cut defense spending ? <> A. The Federal deficit is very serious . It is undermining economic growth . Under this Administration , the Federal deficit is the largest it has been in the history of the country , in part because we ' re not generating enough tax revenue to keep us out of the deficit . And the deficit is creating the need to borrow money that is mortgaging the future of our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private economy and therefore driving up interest rates . You must first deal with what has caused the budget deficit. // One , Reaganomics . The $750 billion tax cut over a three-year period was so severe that it traumatized the economy and triggered us into the longest recession we have gone through since the Great Depression . It was so severe after two years , until the third year they cut it by $100 billion . It was projected to be $750 and it ' s now $650 billion . Combine Reaganomics with the Federal Reserve Board ' s tight money policy , which of course drove up interest rates. // Number two , the $1. 8 trillion military budget , the largest that the world has ever known . This is a five- year budget , with a projected cost overrun of $600 to $750 billion . This data comes from the Congressional Budget Office . The massive recession has us now at 8 to 9 percent unemployment , higher than when Mr. Reagan came in office . For every 1 percent unemployment , it costs $30 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination of Reaganomics where the corporations get the big tax break without any obligation to reinvest in the economy or to reindustrialize the economy or to retrain the workforce . So in a sense you had a dual , a double hemorrhage . Money going out of one part of the national body , corporate incentive , and money going out the other part of the body , the national body , for the massive military budget . The answer in part is the real commitment for full employment . Put America back to work . The need to build , end the slums and build houses and hospitals and build trains and a massive transit system , that would be worth a high-production economy. // **28;416; Q. The increase in job-producing investment , what would that do in terms of the deficit ? Can you quantify that ? <> // A : First of all you should correlate the tax incentive with reinvestment in this economy . It ' s when you ' re not hemorrhaging the economy . You correlate tax incentive , the price a corporation must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . And retrain the workers and reindustrialize also , with the commitment to have the freedom to invest because our economy needs to expand . We have to make the American worker secure . We have to make the American economy secure . In the 1960 ' s we had a 4. 8 percent unemployment and inflation was only 2. 8 percent at the time . It was similar in the Eisenhower years . Because we had a Federal Reserve Board with a low interest rate . They are a factor in that and you ' ve simply got to invest some money to make money . That ' s why there ' s the high production cut . You got to invest in people . And invest in rebuilding American cities . Invest in hospitals , invest in having a competitive private economy . In the last 20 years we have lost our competitive edge in auto , steel , electronics , rubber and textiles . So where is the money ? The money is in low interest rates and you invest in rebuilding America . And the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting returns on . The money is in the waste dimension of the military budget and we have whole weapons systems that are obsolete . <> <> The Military Budget // **28;446; Q. Could you name some in particular that you feel are obsolescent ? <> // A. You got your MX missiles and B-1 missile , and I think we should freeze the military budget at this point . We ought a have a freeze so that you would have a zero real growth in the next five years and that would save $250 billion . A commitment to a peace policy and not just a war policy would save money . The more vigorously that we negotiate and resolve tension diplomatically , the less need we have to keep escalating the building of war materials . A nuclear freeze would save money. // We need to reduce the size of the ground forces in Europe . Also our NATO alliance must now pay their share . And Japan must pay its share . <> <> Domestic Spending and Taxes // **28;476; Q. To eliminate the loopholes as you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense budget , does that mean that you do not see any need for any increased taxation and that you don ' t see a need for cuts in domestic spending ? <> // A. Well , no , there ' s no need at this point for cuts in domestic spending . Right now we need to invest more in education . And invest more in job training . Because our capacity to compete in the future has a lot to do with our children ' s ability to compete with Honda and Toyota , Sony and Panasonic and Mitsubishi and Mercedes-Benz and the Germans and others making transit systems . So the education investment is a sound investment . Because of course , look at the causes of the inflation . The oil jolts , which we can develop reserves to reduce the impact of those jolts . The price of foods which in part had to do with a deal we cut with the Russians and lost our grain reserves . The Vietnam war . We stopped building houses . Skyrocketing medical costs . These were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there has to be a policy that takes into account these problem areas . Now we are still in the development of our program which has specific budgets . We know the areas for the adjustments that need to be made . <> <> Need for ' a Peace Policy ' // **28;506; Q. How much growth , after inflation , should there be in the military budget ? And which weapons programs , proposed by President Reagan , would you alter ? You did indicate that you favor a freeze in the military budget. <> // A : A nuclear freeze and regather the MX missile and the B-1 bomber and nerve gas . And you could freeze the budget and get a more efficient use of the budget allocation that ' s already there . You reduce the waste , and reduce the cost overrun and you still substantially have a basic body of money that we just don ' t have now. // We can save billions of dollars from the military budget and increase our security . Our problem is the President has a war policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace policy. // Some examples of savings . If we freeze the military budget in real terms over five years we will save over $250 billion from Reagan ' s budget proposals for fiscal year ' 84 and ' 88 . Congressional Budget Office is the source of our data. // But these are not enough . We need a peace policy which allows us to reduce the dangerous nuclear arsenals and decrease exposure of our men abroad . One , the Soviet Union has stated it might accept a nuclear freeze . A freeze would increase our security . It would save over $50 billion over the next five years . Two , we ' ve spent one third of our military budget on defending Europe against the threat of Soviet invasion that even the NATO commander in chief says is unlikely . He says the true threat is political intimidation and division among the allies . But it is our weapons policy that causes division. // We need a peace policy , then , which would allow us to unite our allies and decrease our spending . An effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and save billions of dollars. // We ' ve been sold a bill of goods about national security . Since 1945 we ' ve spent over $3 trillion , more than any other country , on the military . And we are less secure now than we were then . Mere military spending can not make us secure . Only a peace policy can . The President wants us to spend over $300 billion on military threats abroad ; over 45 percent of the American people are afraid to walk one mile from their house after dark . <> <> Relations With Soviet Union // **28;536; Q. What steps would you take to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union ? <> // A. We must relate to Russia on terms other than just military character . We have agricultural superiority . Technological superiority . Cultural exchange . Media exchange . The American people know too little about the Soviet Union . And the more we know each other , the more we can have a mutual appreciation of each other ' s ways and means to survive . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not co-annihilation and it must be a policy that takes into account that we can , we need not , our objective is not to proselytize them or to convert them , really , not to proselytize them . But to coexist with them and to expand our trade relations . <> <> Middle East Policy // **28;566; Q. What would you do differently than President Reagan to seek an overall Middle East settlement ? <> // A. The President of the United States ought to have access to all the leaders of nations in the Middle East and ought to talk with , if he chooses to and when he chooses to , all warring factions. // America has a vital interest in peace in the Middle East . We have a moral interest because people are there . Economic interest , we get so much of our energy from them . Military interest , because of the geopolitical position . An interest because of the Persian Gulf , because their borders will take us to the Soviet Union . America has an interest in protecting Israel ' s right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has an interest in Palestinian justice , or self- determination , or a homeland for Palestinian people . The more nomadic and desperate the Palestinians are , the more tension is put upon Israel . But Israeli weapons are inadequate to defend against desperate people who will either use kamikaze or terroristic methods as a way of fighting back . We have an interest in the nonpartitioning of and the territorial integrity of Lebanon . The normalized ties with all Arab nations. // **28;596; Q. How is President Reagan not pursuing policies which adhere to those three interests ? <> // A : When the President , in a negotiation with Mr. Shamir , did not link that negotiation with a commitment on Golan Heights , West Bank occupation , expanded settlements , and the offensive use of American weapons in the invasion and occupation of Lebanon , by the President of this country not correlating a link in the negotiations with those violations , it made America a party to the occupation and to the invasion . In effect America helped to finance that invasion and occupation which robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away from America the role of a neutral peace-keeping force and therefore made our boys the object of the hostility , more so than against the other nations that were there . And that ' s why our marines were the object of the raid . I think that we should support either nonaligned nations or U.N. peace-keeping forces to be there . America can not serve the role of an effective peace-keeping force in Lebanon . So much so that President Reagan has now shifted the role of American marines there from peacekeeping forces to combat forces without authorization from Congress and therefore stands in violation of the War Powers Act . Because he did not get permission from the Congress he ' s asking the marines to fight a war with inadequate equipment or materiel or manpower . Thus the Syrians have us terribly outmanned in that arrangement . We ' re trying to offset the lack of manpower by increasing technical warfare , which has bombs dropping terribly close to Syria , which has us about 75 miles away from a major war with Syria , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // We have an obligation to support Israel ' s right to exist for security , not to support her right to occupy and expand . And America ought to be the first to take the initiative to get out of Lebanon and to prevail upon Israel to go back with a guarantee of keeping Israel ' s borders and boundaries secure and then use our diplomatic leverage to get Syria to go back to Syria. // Given the Gemayel Government , this Government and Israel and Syria and Lebanon should go to Geneva and come out of the Druse mountains of Lebanon . Presently , Mr. Reagan is escalating tensions there with his threats and increased materiel . When last month Mr. Shamir went back to Israel with an armful of weaponry and a commitment to more weaponry and Mr. Gemayel went back empty- handed , it further tilted American Middle East policy and it was provocative and therefore the fighting with Syria was predictable . The bottom line is more Americans were killed and now Lieutenant Goodman is a prisoner of war , an undeclared war in Syria. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to relieve Israel of having so many enemies . And you bring about some of this relief by bringing about a measure of fairness and justice in those relationships. // If America used its strength to get the P.L.O. and others to recognize Israel to exist and Israeli leaders to move toward a mutual recognition policy which I ' m convinced forces like the Peace Now and the Labor Party would go for . If Israel were relieved of the tension that comes as the result of being the object of the anger of so many people , Israel could become the capital of commerce in the Middle East . Israel would be exporting talent and businesses and training . The flower in the desert could bloom all over the desert . Because Israel really is the most brilliant flower in God ' s garden. // **28;626; Q. Would that flowering of Israel as a force in the Middle East simply come about by these kinds of approaches ? Wouldn ' t we have to rewrite a lot of fairly recent history for that to be possible ? <> // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the American President operating with a moral mandate . One would have thought it was impossible to get Egypt and Israel around a bargaining table at Camp David , and surrogates couldn ' t bring that meeting about - only an American President. // And that ' s why the no-talk policy toward the P.L.O. has been a bad policy , because it has deprived the American President of the ability to reduce Israel ' s enemies . If Carter could not have talked to Sadat because Egyptians had killed some Israelis , he couldn ' t have had Camp David , and so - the Israelis maintain the right to talk to the P.L.O. They may choose not to . Apparently they did talk with Arafat to get the prisoners of war released and to get the Palestinians freed . So when they talked , when the Israelis and the P.L.O. talked , in fact , lives were saved . Some Israelis were released from prison - some Palestinians were released from prison . When they talked lives were saved . In the absence of talk lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that an American President could be the negotiating force via the economic , military and social security that both parties need to have a mutual recognition policy . And that is at the heart , the Palestinian question remains at the heart of the Middle East agony . <> <> Central America Policy // **28;656; Q. What do you think of President Reagan ' s policy in Central America , and what would you do differently ? <> // A. First of all , we should see Central America as our next door and not our back door , which would end the contemptuous attitude toward them . Second , we must have a good neighbor policy - a next-door neighbor policy - and see Central America as essentially our allies. // **28;686; Q. What do you mean , contemptuous attitude ? <> // A. Well , essentially as when Reagan says that they ' re in our back door . It ' s our next door . That language - psycholinguistically it expresses a certain measure of contempt - no different than Meese not seeing hungry people or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believed that we could finance the rebels to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua , the Sandinistas . We are now losing - we ' re losing that war , and losing prestige and respect because of our identification with the rebels . We as a nation know too well that we helped the reign of terror and tyranny of the Somoza regime upon those people . Rebellion by the peasants was inevitable . Although the Sandinista Government is less than perfect - I met with their Minister of Culture just two weeks ago ; they ' re moving toward having free elections early next year , in February or in March . America could use its strength there to accept that Government even where it ' s possible to overcome the friction of the rebels and the Sandinista - even be a part of helping to referee or negotiate a relationship that would maximize the security of all forces involved . But the people have a right to self-determination . They have a right to their own Government , and governments in transition often have military phases . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with General George Washington . Our own Government started under military rule and grew into a democracy . Democracy is the most mature form of government . It takes time to get there . When this Government embraces the landed gentry of El Salvador , we ' re misreading history . And to separate aid - I mean to not link aid with a human rights policy - sends a signal around the world of our noncommitment to fairness. // We should again use our strength to negotiate and use our aid as a leverage in bringing about more peaceful relations in El Salvador . The approach of gunboat diplomacy , big- stick diplomacy , nuclear threat , military exercises off of the coast , is a bad approach . And it is the assumption in time that we can officially oppress an idea whose time has come , but it will not happen . If there ' s any message that Christmas has it is that you may lock hope out of the inn , it can even flourish in the stable . An idea whose time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people who have been victims of a banana republic - their time for independence and self-determination and self-government has come. // //
