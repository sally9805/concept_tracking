A dozen Christian groups , ranging from Greek Orthodox to Evangelical Protestant , have long operated educational centers in Jerusalem without difficulty . So have the Mormons , but their local branch of Brigham Young University has now come under fire from Jews who fear that its real purpose is to serve as a center for convert-seeking missionaries . <P> B.Y.U . ' s Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies opened quietly in 1968 , operating in various rented quarters and offering semester-long courses to students from the main Utah campus . In 1980 the university was offered a long-term lease for its own campus on a plum site : a 6.6-acre plot near Hebrew University with a panoramic view of the ancient walled city . B.Y.U . ' s plan , calling for a $15 million seven-story building , including a 500-seat concert hall , was approved by Israeli authorities in 1984 . Now half finished , the structure is due to be completed by the spring of 1987 . <P> The size and conspicuous location of the project helped bring the center to the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' missionary zeal . " We are convinced that this group wishes to Mormonize the people of Israel , " declared 96 Israeli intellectuals in newspaper ads urging a halt to construction . The nation 's two chief rabbis called for a mass rally against the center , and protests by black-hatted , ultra-Orthodox demonstrators have become commonplace at the site . Mayor Teddy Kollek , who approved the project , and the center 's Mormon director have even received death threats . Last week 40 rabbis from communities outside Jerusalem joined the growing protest by picketing the office of Prime Minister Shimon Peres . <P> To calm the waters , B.Y.U . President Jeffrey Holland went to Israel and pledged last August that any Mormon teacher or student who proselytizes will be sent home . Church President Ezra Taft Benson last week wrote to Kollek , promising that Mormons will honor all Israeli laws . These commitments have not mollified Rabbi Moshe Porush of Yad 1'Achim ( A Hand to the Brothers ) , an antimissionary organization that is spearheading the protests . He points to a 1979 Mormon handbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer in use . <P> Responding to the growing pressure , a committee of the Israeli Knesset ( parliament ) wants the project halted , and a special government panel is pondering what to do . Meanwhile , several influential Israelis have come to B.Y.U . ' s defense . Mayor Kollek stated last week that all faiths " should be free to practice their own religion among their own people here in Jerusalem . " Former Foreign Minister Abba Eban declared that the " free exercise of conscience and dissent in a democratic society " is at stake .
