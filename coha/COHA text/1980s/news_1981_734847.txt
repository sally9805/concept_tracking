txt WITII THE approach of the Reagan administration , President Fidel Castro of Cuba has raised the spectre of another flood of refugees washing onto American shores . The threat was made recently in a virulent anti-U.S . speech before the Second Congress of the Cuban Communist Party In Havana . It was accompanied by the boast that the 1980 boatlift of 125,000 Cubans to Florida was the " biggest cleanup " of " scum " in the island 's history . U.S. analysts believe Castro was trying to send President-elect Reagan a warning against pursuing a harsh anti-Cuban foreign policy . But the bluster , they say , was necessary for Castro to justify the unprecedented number of Cubans who clamored to flee his communist society last year . " lie was saying : ' If you get tough with us , here are some things we can do ' , " said one U.S. official . " But he also had to justify the fact that so many people wanted to leave Cuba . Anyway you look at it , that is one big slap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator is In danger of being struck again . Many Cubans still want to leave the island . They want to leave for the some reasons that an estimated one million have left since Castro took power in 1959 : political repression and poor living conditions . Castro acknowledged in his speech that the issue of emigration to the United States has been suspended , not resolved . That much was made clear by the tens of thoUsands of letters from Cubans reU .

Those.letters were stored in high piles of mail sacks inside the U.S. diplomatic mission . I saw them during my recent ' visit there : American diplomats at the U.S. Interests Section , a low-level mission located in the Swiss Embassy , said they were always being stopped in stores , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for red lights to change , by Cubans wanting to flee Castro 's rule . The poor economic conditions in Cuba that helped trigger last year 's disillusionment have not changed since last spring , according to Western analysts . And the economy shows little promise of improvement . The economy has been hurt by diseases in sugar and tobacco crops as well as in hogs and cattle . The foreign trade deficit is also deepening . " Their economy is almost guaranteed to be lousy for at least another decade , probably for two , " said one senior U.S. analyst . Castro , while refusing to concede that anyone but " scum " or " parasites " or " anti-social elements " would want to leave Cuba , admitted that much of the desire to come to the United States stems from " pending problems concerning family reunification . " By that standard alone , it is a fair assumption that last year 's boat lift was not a safety value but instead increased the motivation of many Cubans to leave . That is because the vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single men who left their families . AT KEY West during the height of the influx , at Ft . McCoy , Wis. , at Ft . Chaffee , Ark. , at every site where the refugees were congregated . they repeatedly spoke of their version of the American dream : to make enough money . to bring their remaining relatives to the U.S. to join them . Diplomatic observers agree that Cuba retains a strong desire for normalizing relations with the United States , a desire motivated in part by economic reasons . But , as Castro said in his speech , the election of Reagan has introduced " an element of uncertainty , or rather danger , to U.S.-Cuban relations . " With human pawns constituting the crux of Castro 's diplomacy towards the United States , and conditions in Cuba encouraging continued disillusionment , perhaps Americans have not seen the last of the Freedom Flotilla .
