Ever since Harold Washington became Chicago 's first black mayor in 1983 , white politicians have spoiled for a rematch . Last week , however , Washington handily defeated former Mayor Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary and established himself as the strong favorite in the April 7 general election . <P> The 64-year-old incumbent captured 53% of the vote to Byrne 's 47% , and now faces a Republican as well as two Democrats running on third-party tickets . They seem likely to split the white vote , which is good news for Washington ; he won an estimated 98% of the ballots cast by blacks but only about 20% of those cast by whites in the primary . As far as the mayor is concerned , the more opponents the merrier . " I 'm going to run against whoever runs  --  singly , doubles , triples , " said he . " If they can find a fourth person , we 'll run against them too . "                  @ @ @
