 | Jane Brody eats complex carbohydrates ; Sonja and William Connor eat almost no fat ; Seppi Renggli eats jalapeno peppers all day long , and nobody , but nobody , sneaks half a pint of Haagen-Dazs Swiss Almond Vanilla before bed . Or at least , nobody admits it . Clear arteries and a clean conscience are the goals of a new breed of cookbook author that is trying to lure Americans away from frosted doughnuts into a land flowing with skim milk and just an occasional teaspoon of honey . The culinary gospel preached by these chefs and nutritionists is a simple one : food really ought to be good for you , and good food ought not to taste bad . Americans wo n't be easy to convert , of course ? the nation that still squirts processed cheese from a pressurized can plainly has culinary priorities other than taste and nutrition ? but many of the experts are reformed sinners themselves . Health columnist Jane Brody confesses that she used to be able to polish off a whole box of cookies in no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she testifies in Jane Brody 's Good Food Book ( Norton . $19.95 ) . " Over the last 10 years I 've retrained my taste buds so that now very sweet things do n't taste good to me . " For all these cooks , retraining is the key . Most Americans consume ruinous amounts of fat and salt ; but although nutrition-minded cooks would like to banish the saltshaker , they are n't out to wholly eliminate meat , cheese , eggs and desserts from the American menu . Instead , they aim to change the proportions of our diet , so that vegetables , fruits and grains predominate , red meat gives way to fish and poultry , and sweets and animal fats are used as minor ingredients rather than mainstays . Translating laudable principles into delicious meals is the problem , and these cooks take different approaches ? with varying results . Brody is famous for her sensible , well-researched analyses of health issues for The New York Times , and her cookbook is the most reliable source around for anyone who wants to stock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up healthier habits in cooking and eating . Her enthusiasm for a few of these recipes should be taken with a grain of salt substitute ? there 's a chokingly dry @#  | loaf of oatmeal bread , and she likes ketchup and yogurt in her " French " dressing . But other preparations , such as her fruit desserts or her colleague Pierre Franey 's recipe for broiled fish with mustard , are appealing as well as guilt-free . An even more engaging way to keep track of polyunsaturates and carbohydrates has emerged under the rubric of " spa " cooking , so called because many of the ideas were developed in order to help rich people diet with chic . Edward J. Safdie 's Spa Food ( Clarkson Potter . $19.95 ) offers a complete regimen based on the weight-loss program at the Sonoma Mission Inn in northern California , where guests rejuvenate themselves in accordance with Safdie 's creed : ' " You need - not suffer to be beautiful and fit . " The spa day begins at 5:45 a.m. with a cup of herbal tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; at home , however , you can skip all that and concentrate on the recipes . Nutritionally sound and blessedly un- complicated , these dishes are imaginative and snazzy . Safdie 's spa food includes chicken tostadas with coriander , fresh fruits in every possible guise and distinguished versions of such everyday dishes as pizza , stuffed cabbage and chili . Only the thimble-size servings reveal how dietetic each meal is ; if weight loss is not your goal , keep cooking or you 'll be tempted to follow dinner with a Pepperidge Farm binge . Seppi Renggli , chef of The Four Seasons restaurant in New York , created his own spa cuisine in conjunction with a nutritionist . The result is a low-fat , reduced-calorie alternative to the lavish cooking that has made the restaurant a landmark . The Four Seasons Spa Cuisine ( Simon and Schuster. $17.95 ) presents some four dozen of these meals ? each including an appetizer and a main course ? and appends a nutritional analysis of every dish . More elaborate than its California counterpart , The Four Seasons ' style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulting in somewhat heartier food . To compensate for the lack of salt , Seppi flavors virtually everything from baked apples to stuffed pheasant with jalapeno peppers , but they can easily be omitted ; his whole-wheat linguine with vegetables , a light and sprightly version of pasta primavera , has plenty of flavor without the jalapeno . These recipes are sophisticated and time consuming , and they presuppose a slightly higher level of kitchen expertise than the other health-oriented cookbooks . As for The New American Diet ( Simon and Schuster. $18.95 ) , it presupposes nothing but a tin palate . Sonja and William Connor , the dietician-and-doctor team who devised this eating plan , base their cuisine on respectable nutritional principles , but you ca n't eat good intentions . Sloppily organized , badly written and laden with idiotic exclamation marks ( " Spaghetti and meat sauce ! " ) , the Connors ' book undermines its own advice with recipes that revive the worst of high-school home ec . A few of their ideas , like the " french fries " made by tossing strips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nice to know about , but given a choice between atherosclerosis and canned baked beans topped with canned pineapple on hamburger buns , some cooks will find it a tough call . Unaccountably , all these cookbooks overlook the one food recognized as crucial to health and happiness in every land . This , of course , is chocolate ; luckily Martine Jolly 's Le Chocolat ( Pantheon. $17.95 ) supplies everything one needs to know on this vital topic . Jolly 's book offers cakes , candies and mousses , and her simple but perfect hotfudge sauce has the much-desired quality of hardening slightly as it meets the ice cream . Yes , it all goes straight to your arteries . But it cures everything else . Heavy on the Mayo Nothing beats a nice picnic supper in the summer ? say , some fried chicken , Hoppin ' John , a ham-lima salad and , to top it all off , a hefty slice of Irma Lee Stratton 's chocolate dump cake . Now these fine foods are n't available at your local French charcuterie , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just get hold of a copy of Ernest Matthew Mickler 's White Trash Cooking ( $11.95 ) . Heavy on the bacon fat and blueplate mayonnaise , Mickler 's recipes are enough to make any nouvelle nutritionist chef blanch with horror . But there 's nothing sluggish about the cookbook 's sales : with 25,000 Southern fried : Down-home fare copies in print and another 25,000 on order , it was sold two weeks ago by its small publisher , the Jargon Society , to Ten Speed Press in California for a $90,000 advance ; several big New York publishers also bid on the book . Mickler , 46 , who grew up in the north Florida swamps , scoured the South from Burnt Corn , Ala. , to Hot Coffee , Miss. , for such cherished recipes as Tutti 's fruited porkettes and fried squirrel ( " Make sure all the hair is cleaned off the squirrel ... " ) . He also took the fine accompanying pictures . The book , swears the author , is an affectionate tribute to white trash . " I could n't have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .
