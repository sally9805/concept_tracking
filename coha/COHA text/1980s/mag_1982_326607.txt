Tiny American Motors Corp . quietly became the first U. S. auto company to seek formally to reopen its labor contracts in November , when it asked its 16,000 hourly workers to make wage concessions that would save the company $150 million . The automaker , which has only 2% of the domestic market , has lost some $300 million over the past two years . While cuts in wages and benefits are important to restore General Motors and Ford to financial health , they could mean the survival of American Motors . <P> France 's state-owned Rgie Nationale des Usines Renault has put $350 million into AMC since 1979 , and now controls 46% of the company . Having paid the piper , Renault seems determined to call the tune . Two weeks ago , Gerald C. Meyers stepped down from his post as AMC 's chairman and chief executive officer . Former AMC President W. Paul Tippett Jr. , 49 , will become chairman , and Jos J. Dedeurwaerder , who formerly ran one of Renault 's major plants in France , is the new president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franco-American Motors . <P> The firm 's fortunes are continuing to worsen . Daily sales dwindled to only 286 cars during the first ten days of the year , compared with the already depressed level of 350 a year ago . The drop in AMC 's sales for all of 1981 was the sharpest of any American carmaker . <P> The company has embarked on a series of dramatic moves to meet its financial crisis . Last November it copied a tactic used by Chrysler and delayed payments to some two dozen major suppliers . AMC executives also completed negotiations with bankers to keep open the company 's vital $250 million line of credit . The automaker must raise $1 billion over the next four years to keep its car-and engine-development program rolling . <P> The financial moves and wage concessions should enable AMC to stay on track with plans to introduce this fall a make-or-break American version of the highly successful Renault 9 . That subcompact made its debut last year in Europe under the direction of Dedeurwaerder . <P> Renault is unlikely to back away now from its commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distribution facilities to compete in the U.S. , which has become the key theater in an automotive battle that carmakers are waging around the world . Says Arvid Jouppi , a Detroit-based automobile industry analyst : " The great prize for Renault is to become one of the surviving world companies . If they lost North America , they would immediately be out of the big league . They realize , as do the Japanese , that the American market is a pearl without price . " <P> But unless AMC sales pick up dramatically , the company may be forced to go back to Renault and ask for still more money . The French company is likely to grant such a request only in return for more control over the American company , whose name seems increasingly appropriate .
