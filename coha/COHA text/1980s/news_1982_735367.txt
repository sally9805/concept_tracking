txt In its 1981 annual report , First Federal Savings of Rochester . N.Y .. proudly says that it doubled in size last year . becoming the biggest savings and loan association in the state . It also indicates the $3 billion institution 's net worth grew by $8 million in the second half , which would make it the nation 's second most profitable S &L.; But that is n't exactly the case . Thrift experts estimate that First Fed had a loss of 837.5 million to 850 million from operations in the second half . making it one of the country 's most unprofitable S &Ls.; First Fed was able to report earnings only because of promissory notes given it by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp . and accounting changes that are n't allowed under generally accepted accounting principles , industry sources say . It grew in size only because it failed . and the FSLIC merged it with another failed S &L; to buy time , perhaps until a healthy merger partner can be found . The annual report alludes to loans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't disclose the amount of the loans , any accounting changes , any losses or the reason for the merger . The institution does n't have to . under an FSLIC policy that keeps secret most details of S &L; rescues. even though hundreds of millions of dollars from its insurance fund are at risk . The lack of disclosure about how First Fed was able to report sizable gains resulting from its arranged merger and use of controversial accounting methods has split many in the S &L; industry . The FSLIC is supporting about 15 failed S &Ls; with promissory notes and has authorized controversial accounting devices that defer losses for many more . It declines to provide details about the effect of these measures for fear of alarming depositors , industry sources say . They add that First Fed is just one example , albeit a spectacular one , of the discrepancy between what is reported publicly about an S &L; and its true operating condition . The FSLIC declined to provide any information about First Fed , although a spokesman says " maybe we will " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or accounting practices . Many in the S &L; industry support the FSLIC 's approach . William O'Connell . executive vice president of the U.S. League of Savings Associations , a big trade group , wants the FSLIC to stop requiring all financial statements . Some financial analysts contend that it does n't make any difference what First Fed reports , because it is n't a public company and since last September has been run , in effect , by the FSLIC as a quasi-governmental ward . First Fed is a mutual S &L,; meaning ownership technically is held by depositors Last year , it acquired another big New York thrift . Franklin Society Savings , in a merger arranged by the FSLIC because both had just about exhausted their net worth . Net worth is the excess of assets over liabilities ; without it , financial institutions are considered technically insolvent . An estimated 760 S &Ls; will be technical.ly insolvent by the end of 1983 if high interest rates persist , according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , the FSLIC 's parent . The FSLIC estimates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $461.8 million In assisting mergers of insolvent S &Ls,; as of Dec. 31 . Its insurance fund has a market value of about S5 billion , but Congress and the U.S. Treasury have said they will support the fund if necessary . With such strong backing , many thrift officials , investment bankers and other regulators do n't understand why the FSLIC is so secretive , and they are troubled by the ethics of disguising First Fed 's operating losses from depositors and the public . They also worry that such furtiveness breeds suspicion and causes unnecessary speculation about the FSLIC 's ability to handle the growing number of msolvencies " I believe in disclosure . " says Jack Guttentag , a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania s Wharton School and a First Fed director . " The question is whether or not it is in the public Interest to disclose this . The whole system is fighting for time , and in fighting for time it may be justifiable to do certain things that would n't be thinkable : f the stakes were n't so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of disclosure up at First Fed 's next monthly board meeting . " We ought to explicitly consider it and come to an explicit decision , " Mr. Guttentag says . " I do n't see any reason for being secretive about the numbers , " asserts Paul Horvitz. a professor of finance at the University of Houston and former research director at the FDIC . " The effects on public confidence are counterproductive . " Besides , he argues , the insurance fund 's money is really the public 's , which therefore has a right to know what is being done with it . ( The Fund comes from insurance premiums paid by S &Ls,; and is used by the FSLIC. a public agency , to pay for the disposal of insolvent S &Ls; and insure deposits up to $100,000 an account . ) The FDIC. with a S12 billion fund , has rescued nine mutual savings banks through assisted mergers since November . It has in each case fully disclosed the amount and terms of its assistance . An FDIC spokesman says full disclosure is " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the terms of the agreements . " The FSLIC has disclosed the amounts of relatively small promissory notes issued to two other failing S &Ls.; Two thrift analysts suspect that it wo n't discuss IOUs issued to other S &Ls; because such disclosure would show that the contingent liabilities from assisting sick S &Ls; are more than the $461.8 million claimed by the agency . The FSLIC has n't publicly disclosed that it allowed both First Fed and Franklin Society to change their books , using a practice that violates generally accepted accounting principles . " From an accounting standpoint , it ca n't be justified , " asserts Thomas Cleveland . the national director of banking accounting for Touche Ross &; Co . " If there are real losses here . they ought to be portrayed . " ( First Fed wo n't disclose the opinion of its outside auditor , Price , Waterhouse &; Co. )
