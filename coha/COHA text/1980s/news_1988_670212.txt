MIAMI  --  For weeks , the jury watched and listened in fascination , consumed by an unfolding tale of love , tragedy and pursuit of revenge . There was the young husband waiting in a hospital as his beautiful wife underwent minor surgery in a room but a few feet away . The dreaded emergency call " code blue , " a medical situation gone awry . The husband ' s rush to a wife who would linger on in a coma for nearly a year . In heavy , accusing tones , the plaintiff ' s attorney , a folksy man with time etched in his creased features and whitened hair , declared that this woman was killed by " sloppy , incompetent medical care . " The hospital and a doctor , the anesthesiologist , suffocated her brain and stilled her heart , he contended , allegedly by accidentally inserting an anesthesia tube into her stomach instead of her lungs . He boldly brought out  --  then brushed aside  --  the anguished husband ' s admission that he had stalked the hospital corridors with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the jury a videotape of what four children saw when they visited their comatose mother . Verdict : $4. 1 million against Miami ' s Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and the anesthesiologist . Thus , in the spring of 1986 , another big verdict was won by J.B. Spence , oft called the father of Florida medical-malpractice litigation . Wealthy and 65 , an age when most of his peers are seeking respite from the battle , Mr. Spence shows little sign of slowing down . " I enjoy suing the bastards , " he says , succinctly revealing his motivation and his view of doctors . The role of malpractice attorneys is attracting a lot of attention  --  and criticism  --  in Florida as the state slides into what Mr. Spence , like others , calls " an insurance crisis of immense proportions . " Granted only part of a requested rate increase , St. Paul Fire &; Marine Insurance Co. , once the state ' s largest medical-malpractice insurer , is phasing out all physicians ' and surgeons ' professional-liability coverage . Although CNA Financial Corp. says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines , " Florida is facing a dire plight . In Dade and Broward counties , for instance , a neurosurgeon  --  even one just beginning practice  --  pays as much as $250 , 958 a year for professional liability insurance . For an obstetrician , it can cost $198 , 179 . The situation has reached the point that there are charges of injured patients being refused treatment for fear of litigation . And medical groups say some physicians , particularly in high-risk specialties , are retiring or leaving the state to escape the excruciating insurance costs and the litigious atmosphere . And litigious it is . Not only is South Florida ' s litigation rate among the highest in the nation , but the size of its claim settlements appears second to none . A U.S. General Accounting Office report found Florida ' s average paid claim on behalf of physicians in 1984 to be a huge $140 , 594 , dwarfing New York ' s $104 , 810 , California ' s $61 , 774 and the national average of $56 , 739 . In 1986 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broward counties were the highest for any rating territory of St. Paul Fire , which operates in 42 states and is the nation ' s largest medical-malpractice insurer . Florida ' s legislature is expected to wrestle with the problem in a special session next month . Almost every plan being advanced will include some form of cap on medical-malpractice jury awards . To Mr. Spence , that not only hurts the victim but also ignores the main culprit . " The leading cause of the problem is the bad doctor ; there ' s a lot of sloppy medicine practiced in this state , " he says . He advocates cracking down on poor medical practices and demanding regular testing and updating of physicians . " Hold their feet to the fire , and malpractice would be stopped in its tracks , " he declares . " That ' s absolute nonsense , and he knows it , " responds James White , the president of the Florida Medical Association . Dr. White notes that the Academic Task Force , a group set up by the state to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasing frequency of very large claims as a particular problem . ( The report also called for tougher regulation and discipline of the medical profession . ) When Mr. Spence is involved , the likelihood of a big claim and big settlement is high . The average medical-malpractice attorney never wins a million-dollar verdict , but Mr. Spence has had 25 , with eight verdicts or settlements above a million dollars in 1986 alone . As his fee , he collects 40% of each award , and 45% if it is on appeal  --  though he sometimes splits the money with other attorneys . " Like tennis and golf , there are only a few who have both the talent and the disposition to do it well , " says Federal District Court Judge William Hoeveler , who as a defense trial lawyer some years ago battled Mr. Spence many times . " When you find both , as you do in J.B. , those are the ones who win . " Dissecting expertise , of course , can be a tricky undertaking . Mr. Spence , however , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his selectivity : He turns down 20 cases for every one he accepts . In addition , many in the local legal community cite his uncanny knack for selecting jurors . Although juries are supposed to be a cross section of the population , they tend to be dominated by ordinary workaday people simply because there are so many of them . Even then , Mr. Spence proceeds carefully . " When you pick a good jury , the case is 90% won , " he contends , adding : " I can just about look at a person and tell if I want him as a juror . If he has Gucci loafers , a Rolex watch and a Kiwanis pin , he has his , and he has no heart for the underdog . He doesn ' t believe in the jury system , he doesn ' t like lawyers , and he ' s afraid of being sued . He may be the backbone of America , but he ' s not going to sit on my jury . " Instead , Mr. Spence says , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corduroy jacket , with no tie and reading a paperback . " He loves to have warmhearted grandmothers on his juries . But he ' s skeptical of female jurors when the plaintiff is an attractive woman . " As a general rule , they ' re jealous , " he asserts . At 5 feet 7 inches and 160 pounds , Mr. Spence doesn ' t present an imposing figure to his workaday jurors . " I don ' t look like a lawyer , and I don ' t talk like a lawyer  --  I ' m not polished , " he says . He says he has overheard other attorneys disparage him . Asked what single trait accounts most for his success , he responds , " I understand people . " In some ways , that isn ' t surprising . Orphaned at 16 , he grew up in northwest Florida with his grandfather , a tenant farmer who worked other people ' s land for a share of the crops . The boy , whose birth certificate says " unnamed Spence child , " got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , " Let ' s call him J.B. " He says he grew up in a house " so far back in the woods we used to gather on the porch to watch a car go by . " He plowed afoot behind a mule , picked cotton and hoed peanuts . At 17 , he ran away  --  and ended up in the Navy . For six years , starting before Pearl Harbor , the Navy would be family , and , for four years , the destroyer USS Gary would be home . In 1946 , he left the Navy , a 24-year-old high-school dropout lacking direction and any marketable skill . For 18 months , he mowed lawns , sold cars , painted houses and drove a laundry truck  --  but his status began to gnaw at him . " I was sick of gathering people ' s dirty laundry , and I hated taking orders , " he says . It was then that a Veterans Administration adviser observed , " J.B. , you ' re going to be a flunky all your life unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years from starting night classes to finish high school , he graduated cum laude from the University of Miami Law School . He almost quit law school once , bored by the tedium of a real-estate course . But the theatrical atmosphere of a crowded courtroom excited him . After a stint as an assistant attorney general , he attracted the attention of Perry Nichols , a famed personal-injury lawyer with whom he worked for 15 years before striking out on his own . From his background , the Nichols tutelage and the grind of handling " dreg " cases , he developed his courtroom style . " Some attorneys are arrogant , some are nasty , and a few are vicious , " observes George Lanza , a defense attorney who has often faced Mr. Spence . " J.B. is humble . He ' s the guy next door , sincere and honest . He comes across like he ' s discussing the case with a bunch of people in his living room . " But courtroom drama , presented with persuasive , emotion-stirring oratory , is a Spence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' s not Melvin Belli  --  but he knows how to convey his case to the jury , " says Administrative Judge John Gale . Mr. Lanza recalls Mr. Spence representing a young model who lost a leg in a medical-malpractice case : " He stripped her down to her shorts , and , with that leg hanging there , he argued her case . The jury went for $3. 4 million . " Mr. Spence ' s clients often take off clothing just before defendants lose their shirts . In 1985 , he represented a young beautician who set herself on fire and was badly burned over her upper body . She sued her psychiatrist , arguing that she had already tried suicide once and he should have hospitalized her to protect her . Over the defense attorney ' s violent objections , Mr. Spence had her strip down to her bra and panties and display scars that even he calls " gruesome . " The jury , impressed , awarded $2. 1 million . ( However , the judge set the verdict aside , saying " psychiatrists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict human conduct . " The case is on appeal . ) Observes another veteran of battles with Mr. Spence , attorney George Mitchell , " I never tried a case with J.B. when he didn ' t put the widow on the stand . " His style soon began impressing jurors . " When J.B. came on the scene , there were almost no malpractice decisions against doctors , " recalls Howard Barwick , a defense attorney . " He won a malpractice award of $100 , 000 in the 1960s when six-figure verdicts were unheard of for anything  --  and that sent up a flag . Medical-malpractice cases increased greatly after that . " In 1967 , Mr. Spence won a jury award of $1. 5 million , which he says was the first Florida personal-injury award to top a million dollars . Although medical-malpractice cases account for some 90% of his work , he uses emotional tactics in other litigation as well . In a case involving the death of an eight-year-old girl killed by a truck , Mr. Spence put on the witness stand her younger sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem she had composed about how much she missed her sister . " I deal with a very raw slice of life , " he notes . As his court victories piled up , defense attorneys became leery of him . In final arguments , one told the jury : " I am concerned about the obvious excellent speaking ability of Mr. Spence . He is an excellent orator . He can be very passionate . He may cry and try to get any of you to cry during his closing remarks . That is very difficult to combat . " Mr. Spence did cry  --  and so did much of the jury , which then voted a multimillion-dollar award . While empathy for victims drives him , so does antipathy for doctors . " One reason I enjoy suing them is the colossal ego and arrogance I see , the holier-than-thou attitude that because they save lives that gives them the privilege to get away with it malpractice once , " he fumes . Mr. Spence says he and his family have never had a firsthand problem with bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very strongly so . " He comments , " I can ' t stand pomposity at any quarter , whether lawyers , judges or whatever . But for absolute pomposity , doctors are No. 1  --  America ' s only nobility . Who else walks into a restaurant and presents his title , ' I ' m Doctor Jones ' ? " His antipathy for doctors is reciprocated . One unsuccessfully sued him for libel in 1984 after he criticized the physician in a speech to a hospital staff . He says he was booed off a stage by the University of Miami Medical School after being invited to talk there . And he says that when a son  --  one of his four children  --  was injured in a football game , the boy was turned away by a hospital when its officials learned who he was . Mr. Spence also has abruptly left some cocktail parties after being insulted by medical people . He finds solace , however , in a personal income that ran about $2. 5 million last year . He has expensive foreign sport cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and in the Florida Keys ; two sizable sailboats ; and long vacations in the Virgin Islands . But to remind himself of his fallibility , he regularly reviews a file labeled " J.B. ' s Blunders , " errors he made in court . One , he recalls , was a case he lost after selecting an Army colonel as a juror . " That was a one-man jury , " Mr. Spence complains . " He dominated other jurors , and he convinced everybody that what I presented was physically impossible . " That was more than two decades ago , but to this day Mr. Spence , when walking into court to pick a jury in a major case , carries in his pocket a slip of paper that says " no colonels .
