Honor Student Ryan White , 13 , began seventh grade last week . But he did not get on a yellow bus to travel the five miles to the Western Middle School near Kokomo , Ind . For Ryan , classroom is his bedroom , where he tries to hear teachers and speak to fellow pupils via a telephone hookup . Ryan is a hemophiliac who contracted acquired immunodeficiency syndrome last winter through a blood transfusion . Although Indiana state health officials say that students with AIDS can attend school as long as their condition does not threaten others , District Superintendent of Schools J.O . Smith decided to bar Ryan from classrooms , calling AIDS " the most scary of all communicable diseases . " Ryan 's parents have sued school officials , claiming discrimination . <P> In school districts throughout the country , children with AIDS are at the center of growing concern , conflict and confusion . Despite the intensity of , the emotions involved , only 183 people under the age of 18 in 23 states have been diagnosed as AIDS victims . Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued guidelines allowing children with AIDS to attend school , but few if any are actually in classrooms . In Los Angeles the policy has yet to be enforced . Says Associate Superintendent Jerry Halverson : " There has been an agreement and understanding that children with AIDS would not be enrolled in school , predicated almost entirely on the welfare of the patient . " In New York City , a special panel made up of health experts , an educator and a parent will decide before school starts whether each of seven children who have AIDS should be placed in classrooms . <P> The widespread alarm about AIDS in schools , especially among parents who fear that their children could be infected by a classmate , is understandable , but it is not supported by medical evidence . Last week the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta issued a report aimed at providing authoritative guidance to schools and parents . The CDC found that " based on current evidence , casual person-to-person contact as would occur among schoolchildren appears to pose no risk . . . ( Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-school day-care . . . in an unrestricted setting . " Indeed , there are no known instances of a child with AIDS infecting his parents or siblings . The report did caution that preschool-age children and those who lack bodily function control or who have open sores should be treated with care in order to " minimize exposure of other children to blood or body fluids . " <P> Like any other children , AIDS victims have a right to a free public education , which is the schools ' duty to provide . But , says New York University Law School Professor Martin Guggenheim , that duty can be discharged if necessary " through home instruction . " Carol Sobel , associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles , maintains , " Society has an obligation to make the lives of these children as normal as possible . Telephone hookups and tutors deny children the full benefits of a public education . " <P> Ultimately , cases like Ryan White 's may become even more painful as they turn into politicized local issues . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned that school boards are acting out of fear and prejudice rather than rational concerns for the welfare of children . "
