As a blizzard of ticker tape fell from the skies , Peru 's most famous novelist stepped onto a rickety stage in downtown Lima . Before him , a crowd of 25,000 waved red-and-white Peruvian flags and chanted " Libertad ! Libertad ! " ( " Freedom ! Freedom ! " ) . They then began to shout his name : " Mario ! Mario ! Mario ! " <P> Mario Vargas Llosa , 51 , the author of such acclaimed novels as The War of the End of the World and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter , had torn himself away from the proofs of his new book to embroil himself in Peru 's latest crisis . Addressing the crowd in Lima , Vargas Llosa warned , " A totalitarian threat is hovering over our country . " The menace : a move by Peruvian President Alan Garcia Perez to nationalize private banks . <P> Since he led his populist party to victory in 1985 , Garcia , 38 , has diminished the power and influence of the country 's two major conservative parties . Now Garcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in Vargas Llosa , a persuasive crusader . " If the government takes control of the financial life of this country , it is going to have such untrammeled power that democracy will become completely destabilized , " argues the writer . " Crazy Horse will fall ! Crazy Horse will fall ! " shouted the audience at Vargas Llosa 's rally , using the nickname Garcia has earned because of his penchant for the unpredictable . <P> Shortly after his election , Garcia unilaterally declared an annual payment ceiling of 10% on Peru 's $14.5 billion foreign debt . The freed-up funds were then used to subsidize a jobs program , increase wages and cut taxes . As a result , inflation dropped from 159% to 62% . <P> To ensure the country 's long-term growth , Garcia asked Peruvian bankers and capitalists to channel funds into local industries . Though private investment increased by 26% in 1986 , the economy nonetheless is showing signs of faltering ; inflation is expected to reach 100% by year 's end . In May rising prices prompted a general strike that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled into crisis , Garcia decided to nationalize the country 's ten private banks . With Lima in charge of capital , Garcia argues , loans can be ( channeled to the small businesses and farms that the banks have traditionally ignored . Despite heated opposition from conservatives , the plan is expected to be passed by the 60-member Senate , where Garcia 's party and its allies hold 32 seats . <P> While polls show that about 60% of Peruvians support Garcia 's policy , the debate over nationalization has broken the broad consensus that sustained him through his first two years . Already there are suggestions that the right will unite behind Vargas Llosa , but the novelist denies he is seeking political office . " I 'm a writer and nothing more , " he says . " If this wretched law were suspended in the Senate , I would go back to my study . " Few take his demurrals seriously . Vargas Llosa has himself brooded over his obsession with his homeland . " For me , " he has said , " Peru is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
