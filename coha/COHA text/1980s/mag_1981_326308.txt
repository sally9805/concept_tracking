He leaned against a pole in Washington 's seedy terminal , then sat restlessly in a blue plastic seat . He seemed in no hurry to go anywhere . <P> <P> Enjoying a rare day without guests or meetings , the Reagans lunched together in the White House .

At an early morning breakfast with 140 sub-Cabinet-level officials of his Administration in the East Room , Reagan gave a pep talk . He quoted Thomas Paine , declaring , " We have it in our power to begin the world over again . " Then followed short meetings with his senior staff in the Oval Office and a national security briefing . All were in the normal workday pattern . <P> <P> Hinckley got up early . He stopped in the Lunchbox Carryout Shop , just a few doors from his hotel , for coffee at 7:30 a.m . An hour later , he ordered breakfast in Kay 's Sandwich Shoppe , adjacent to the hotel .
