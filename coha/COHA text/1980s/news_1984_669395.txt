Prince Hans Adam is the technological age ' s manager-prince . When he talks about his future role as head of state , this descendant of 800 years of Austrian nobility sounds like the chairman of a corporate board of directors : ' ' A reigning prince should look at long-range projects and concentrate on guidelines , but leave the day-to-day management to the government , ' ' he says. // No company boss has the powers of a Liechtenstein sovereign , however . Although the tiny country is a direct democracy with referendums a regular occurrence , the Prince must approve all laws , open parliament , represent his nation abroad , and commute sentences. // This summer , Prince Franz Josef II , Europe ' s longest-reigning monarch ( 45 years ) , will step down , making way for his business school-trained eldest son as regent . The retiring Prince was the first of his family , which bought Liechtenstein in the 18th century , to actually live here . Under his reign , a 60-square mile backwater nestled between Austria and Switzerland grew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita nations. // Crossing the border from Switzerland into Liechtenstein , a country road meanders into the superficially sleepy capital of Vaduz . One of the first sights is a big , shiny post office selling one of this alpine land ' s most lucrative products - postage stamps . Each year , some 100 , 000 collectors in 127 countries subscribe to four new editions. // There is little sign of the estimated 25 , 000 foreign companies that have set up residence in the principality ( pop. 26 , 000 ) . But then , they are often not much more than names on post office boxes . A succession of prosperous banks , however , bear witness to Liechtenstein ' s lure for the world ' s rich . Bank secrecy is even harder to penetrate here than in Switzerland . The recurring international financial scandal regularly highlights Liechtenstein ' s very liberal company law regulations. // Above the town stands the craggy Castle of Vaduz . In the cobblestone courtyard , Prince Hans Adam ' s young butler waits to lead the way up to a surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner of the downstairs stone entrance are boots and helmets belonging to the prince ' s four school-age children. // A friendly handshake and Hans Adam explains why he thinks a reigning prince is not an anachronism today : ' ' A prince or a king does not belong to a political party , an elected president does . It is more difficult for him to be respected as a neutral arbiter . We can be more independent. ' ' // For Liechtenstein , one of the world ' s smallest countries , he sees an added plus : ' ' The US president is received and heard everywhere , even when he is only a candidate . That is not so with a small country . A reigning prince , however , is there for a long time and he can gradually build up the contacts which his country needs. ' ' // Prince Hans Adam is bent on bringing Liechtenstein into the United Nations . As with many small countries which have no embassy network abroad , the international forum is where they can feel the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world outside Europe is becoming more and more important for us. ' ' // Liechtenstein exports more than 90 percent of its manufactured goods , with machinery and allegedly the world ' s best false teeth at the top of the list . An increasing percentage is sold outside Europe . This accounts for Liechtenstein ' s healthy economy as well as its position as an international financial center. // Will the new prince tighten up his country ' s much-criticized company laws and soften bank secrecy , a constant irritation to foreign governments out to track down their tax dodgers ? // He responds by saying , ' ' We give legal assistance in cases of criminal abuse . It would be impossible , even if we had a police state , to prevent all misuse of our system . Even in communist countries , there are economic scandals. ' ' // Why is Liechtenstein , with no natural resources , so prosperous ? For the Prince , there is no doubt : // ' ' A diversity of small- and medium-size firms , heavily dependent on exports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from the state . We can only assist them through low taxation and that was , apparently , a good strategy. ' ' // Liechtenstein has no army . Yet the No. 1 topic with the Prince , as with most politically aware Europeans today , is anxiety about the possible destruction of their homeland by nuclear war . Therefore , tiny Liechtenstein has been unusually active at the Madrid and Stockholm security conferences. // ' ' The present defense strategy for Europe is not the optimum . Europe has to rely on the willingness of the United States to defend it . One can ask , ' How long will this willingness last ? ' It might be difficult for a new leadership in the Soviet Union to believe that the US would risk its own destruction for the freedom of Europe . Therefore , present policy is dangerous for the US , because it might be faced with the alternative of losing Europe or going into an atomic war . It is dangerous for the Soviet Union because through a miscalculation of the situation in Europe , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince would like to see a thorough rethinking of defense policy , including a transfer of Western Europe ' s nuclear weapons control to a European multilateral defense organization excluding the US. // Liechtenstein ' s Hans Adam can also get worked up about domestic politics . This year the country ' s men will vote once again on extension of voting rights to women. // ' ' I am hoping that it will succeed this time . But if not , we must put the issue before our men again and again and again until they finally say ' yes ! ' ' ' // When he was 18 the Prince spent his holidays working in the office of Sen. Claiborne Pell ( D ) of Rhode Island . He came away with an indelible impression : ' ' My work was to cut out of the local papers whoever had died , been born , or received a degree , so that we could send an acknowledgment . Something that nobody does over here . That taught me how important it is to be close to your constituency. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the local schools . His wife , Princess Marie , shops in Vaduz . According to the sales assistant in Vaduz ' s fashionable boutique : ' ' She never wants any special attention. ' ' // //
