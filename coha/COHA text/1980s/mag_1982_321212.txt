The navy nets a spy sub , but can it be landed ? <P> <P> On a sunny Friday afternoon , two Swedish naval officers aboard a motorboat chugging through the waters near a naval base on Musk Island , about 30 miles south of Stockholm , glimpsed a periscope flashing through the waves . The alert quickly went out that a foreign submarine was lurking in Swedish waters , and within hours the hunt was on . Throughout last week , dozens of ships and helicopters swept back and forth across Hars Bay , dropping depth charges to try to bring the mystery sub to the surface . " We do n't intend to pat it on the back or just follow it out to sea , " vowed Rear Admiral Christer Kirkegaard , leader of the hunt . " We want to find out where it came from and what it left down there . " <P> It was strongly suspected that the submarine was from a Warsaw Pact nation , most probably the Soviet Union , although Moscow scoffed at the notion , calling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base on Musk Island is Sweden 's largest and most sensitive ; its radar keeps constant watch over the country 's eastern coastline , which faces the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea . If the vessel were from the Soviet bloc , its probable mission was to gather as many details as possible about the base and the surrounding waters . Washington believes that in the event of war the Soviets would try to invade Norway through Sweden , hoping to control the northern Atlantic sea lanes . Submarines can better chart the underwater conditions than the Soviets ' sophisticated trawlers , which are laden with electronic surveillance gear . <P> Moscow had snooped in Swedish waters before . In October 1981 , a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine ran aground near a naval base at Karlskrona . Ten days later , after a humiliating interrogation of the ship 's captain , the indignant Swedes hauled the sub out to sea . Last June , the Swedish navy spent 14 days in futile pursuit of a reported sub in the Gulf of Bothnia . But the latest trespass raised the greatest fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so close to our main naval base , that it seems more aggressive and ruthless than anything before , " declared Commander Hans von Hofsten , who is in charge of briefing the more than 300 reporters who have flocked to Hars Bay . <P> For that reason , Swedish authorities decided to try to trap the sub , force it to the surface and question those aboard . Within a few days after the first sighting , the Swedes managed to bottle up the sub in Hars Bay , a narrow channel ( 12 miles long and 3 miles wide ) between the mainland and Musk Island . Both major openings in the bay were blocked by a forest of submarine nets , chains and magnetic cords . <P> Some 40 patrol boats , torpedo boats , minesweepers , surveying ships and buzzing police launches joined in the hunt . Many of the pursuers carried highly sensitive sonar equipment . Overhead clattered ten antisubmarine helicopters , which lowered hydrophones into the water like stethoscopes . When a telltale noise was heard , a chopper or a boat would drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . The waters of the bay rose in explosive plumes , and the air was filled with the smell of dead fish .
