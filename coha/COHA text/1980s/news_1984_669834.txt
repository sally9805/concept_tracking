In 1946 , there was only one of them , Eniac at the University of Pennsylvania . A decade later , there were 600 computers . There were 30 , 000 by 1966 , 400 , 000 by 1976 and today there are more than six million . It is estimated that by 1990 half of American households will have a computer . So it computes that this phenomenon should bring in its wake books to explain its history , its meaning , its future . " Engines of the Mind : A History of the Computer , " by Joel N. Shurkin ( Norton , 352 pages , $17. 50 ) , is a popularized , clearly written history of computing . " Silicon Valley Fever : Growth of High-Technology Culture , " by Everett M. Rogers and Judith K. Larsen ( Basic Books , 276 pages , $19. 95 ) , examines the rise of that California enclave and the people who work there . There are some interesting historical excursions in " Engines of the Mind . " I had not realized that the philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation "  --  was the inventor of a counting machine with stepped wheels , a device used in many mechanical calculators into the 1970s . And there is an illuminating portrait of the 19th-century English mathematician and eccentric Charles Babbage , whose inventions eventually led to the modern computer . Of all the marvelous characters in this history , none is more fascinating than Ada , Countess of Lovelace , a collaborator and protegee of Babbage ' s . She was the only daughter of the poet Lord Byron , and the wife of the Earl of Lovelace . She was also an inveterate gambler , an alcoholic , a cocaine addict and a " loose woman . " Babbage ' s " enchantress of numbers " died at age 36 , given credit by many for helping design the programming system of his machines  --  possibly the first computer programmer . Mr. Shurkin is most valuable in his meticulous examination of the building of Eniac , the first general-purpose electronic computer . The government contract to build it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 1943 . It was meant to help in the time-consuming wartime work of calculating weapon trajectories . One reason the Moore School had been chosen for ballistics work was that the Philadelphia area , with Bryn Mawr College and other schools , was a source of talented and draft-proof women to do the laborious hand calculations for the trajectories . Mr. Shurkin beautifully captures the hectic , creative air at the Moore School as young engineers labored under John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert to construct Eniac , which put Penn and the Moore School light years ahead of the academic competition in the computer field . It ' s sad to read of Penn ' s shortsighted dismantling of the team that built Eniac and the group ' s scattering to the four winds . But for the stiff-backed attitude of some Penn officials , the Delaware might be the river flowing through Silicon Valley . Would Silicon Valley be the same if it were located anywhere else ? Toward the end of their book , the authors of " Silicon Valley Fever " list a series of places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Mountain ( Colorado Springs , Colo . ) , Silicon Prairie ( Dallas-Austin ) and Silicon Desert ( Phoenix , Ariz . ) . Their examination of the Silicon Valley life style certainly indicates an unusual depth of narcissism . There are more divorces than marriages now in Santa Clara County , and figures on charitable giving rank it among the lowest in the country even though the area is at the top of the prosperity charts . The other side of the coin is that the valley is America writ large , a place where talent and energy can make you a millionaire overnight . Authors Rogers and Larsen delight at chronicling this aspect of the valley , too , such as the story of the Home Brew Computer Club . The club was formed in 1975 to facilitate information exchange among minicomputer buffs . Since then , 22 microcomputer companies have been launched by its members , including Apple , Cromemco and North Star . " Silicon Valley Fever " introduced me to a couple of expressions that I had not heard before , and which I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " means dismantling a competitor ' s product bit by bit to see how it was put together , with an eye , of course , to stealing what one can . " Deskilling " is " a process of job simplification by computer technology so that less skilled , lower paid workers can be substituted for more educated , higher paid employees . " Middle managers beware . The authors of this very informative book end with a chapter that could be called " Whither Silicon Valley ? " Among their speculations is that certain Republican and Democratic politicians known as advocates of high-technology development might join forces to form a high-technology third political party . Such a party is unlikely because it would be too vulnerable to attack as elitist . If it does happen , there is one politician the authors put in the high-technology camp who won ' t be a member , because his stake within his own party has risen so radically in recent months . He is Gary Hart.  --  - Mr. Monaghan is a New York-based writer waiting impatiently for the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
