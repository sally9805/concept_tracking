It had the potential , or so it seemed for a while , of producing the most sweeping arms control agreement in the history of the nuclear age . The most dramatic proposal was to slash in half the long-range nuclear missiles in the arsenals of the superpowers and eventually eliminate them altogether . Until a half-hour before the meeting broke up on Sunday evening , virtually all the pieces seemed to be in place . Yet in the end , the Iceland summit broke down over a single word : laboratory . <P> After two intensive days of bargaining , Mikhail Gorbachev would not relent in his insistence that Ronald Reagan 's cherished Strategic Defense Initiative , designed to serve as a space-based shield against ballistic missiles , be confined to " laboratory research . " And Reagan was equally adamant that the U.S. retain the right not only to conduct scientific research on new Star Wars weapons but to develop and test them as well . <P> The first indication that the hastily called meeting in Reykjavik would be more than merely a modest presummit planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev had ceremonially shaken hands , posed for photographers and then sat down to business , alone except for interpreters and notetakers . Reagan assumed their opening discussion would be a general one , each man outlining his broad vision of ways to manage the superpower rivalry . But after the President suggested they move from their armchairs to a rectangular wooden table , the Soviet leader pulled a detailed set of notes out of his briefcase . Then he proceeded to read . What he had brought with him , it turned out , was a series of sweeping new Soviet proposals on the whole gamut of arms-control issues : medium-range missiles , long-range strategic weapons , space defenses  --  the works . <P> As soon as the morning session ended , Secretary of State George Shultz hurriedly summoned five top American officials into " the bubble , " a tiny secure room at the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik , to consider a reply . A brief session in the bubble with his advisers , followed by more discussions over a lunch of baked chicken , produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read at his afternoon session , ones that took into account Gorbachev 's morning proposals and dwelt on the areas of potential agreement . <P> The sessions were supposed to end on Sunday morning , but with the chance of an agreement of historic proportions in sight , the two sides met on into the evening . It was only after sunset that the optimism began to unravel . To the Soviets , every element of the deal , it seemed , hinged on the curtailment of Star Wars . When that proved impossible , there was nothing left to do but offer grim handshakes and go home . The original purpose of the meeting  --  to set a date for a full-scale summit in the U.S. and work out a frame work for an agreement on medium-range missiles that could serve as its centerpiece  --  was lost in the dust . No deal , no date , no plans for future summits .
