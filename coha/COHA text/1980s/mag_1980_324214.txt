Daring , drama and despair as the Olympics get off to a rousing start <P> Werner Heisenberg 's Principle of Uncertainty states that no one can predict the exact behavior of even a single atomic particle . Heisenberg might have appreciated the 1980 Winter Olympics . The Lake Placid Games have developed into a sort of festival of life 's unpredictability . No one knows whether they will be the last Olympics of the modern era ; international politics will settle that . A similar uncertainty hung like fog over the frozen spectators ; none of them knew whether they would ever find a bus to carry them away from a darkening mountain to warmth again . Lake Placid 's logistics tended toward the existential . <P> A number of athletes were also discovering something about life 's talent for surprise . Canada 's Ken Read , a favorite to win the most important ski race in the world , the Olympic men 's downhill , pitched himself out of the starting gate and 15 seconds into his run , felt the safety binding on his left ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential gold he had spent years training for . The men 's downhill winner was just as unpredictable : Austria 's Leonhard Stock , the 21-year-old Tyrol farmer 's son who was not even supposed to be a starter on the downhill team . The women 's downhill , however , followed form . The favorite was Austria 's Anne-marie Moser-Prll , 26 , who had captured the World Cup six times but had never taken an Olympic event . She attacked Whiteface Mountain fiercely , won easily and was mobbed by jubilant members of her ski club from back home in Kleinarl , who trampled down fences to get to her . <P> The American pursuit of gold went haltingly at first . Although Pete Patterson finished an unexpected fifth in the downhill , Karl Anderson tumbled spectacularly just out of the gate , and Phil Mahre , considered the best U.S. skier , managed only a 14th . Bill Koch , 24 , who surprised the world with a silver medal in the 30-km cross-country four years ago at Innsbruck , surprised it again . With 8 km to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than finish exhausted , dropped out and skied off through the forest . He hoped to save energy for the 15-km event , but he ended up 16th as , in an astonishing finish , Sweden 's Thomas Wassberg edged Finland 's Juha Mieto by one-hundredth of a second . <P> In the 1,500-meter race , Speed Skater Beth Heiden , 20 , had reason for hope as she flashed across the finish line in 2:13.10 . She had just broken the Olympic record by 3.48 sec . The trouble : 17 other skaters also were to break the record . Beth ended up in seventh place as Annie Borchink , 28 , a sturdy Dutch nursing student , glided off with the gold in a time of 2:10.95 . But no one was hit by Heisenberg 's Principle harder than the American pairs figure-skating team of Randy Gardner and Tai Babilonia . The Olympics ' most touching moment was the sight of the brilliant Gardner sprawling on the ice , victim of a muscle pull that ended the golden hopes of Randy and Tai.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
