txt Lloyd C. Schermer , president and chief executive officer of Lee Enterprises , .. Inc. , Davenport , Ia. , pub-lisping and broadcasting firm , spoke recently to the American Newspaper Publishers Association in . C/iicage . His remarks were titled " Unbundling . ? The Key to Newspaper Growth in the Telecommunientions Era . " An excerpt foUotos . WHEN AN information-seeker is browsing a large amount of material to satisfy curiosity with no specifics in mind , as many of our subscribers do every day , there 's hardly any substitute for print . ? However , when one knows exactly what is wanted ; an interactive video display terminal becomes important . Such a system can actually enhance the informa- tion it carries because the information has the capability of being updated rapidly , and delivered selectively , to the informationzeeker , and the information-seeker has some control over the conduit . It is in the development of new conduits that our greatest threats andgreatest opportunities exist . When a newspaper bundle is dropped for our carriers there is more in that bundle than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . And that bundle of information is and will be unbundled by these new electronic conduits over the next decade . As . a matter of fact , the unbundling process has been going on for years with preprints , shoppers ; radio , . weeklies , television , newsletters , cable TV ; specialized ' magazines , and most recently , the phone company's. 900 Dial-It services . A daily newspaper . with a circulation of 10.0,000 translates into about 250,000 readers every day . Technology is making it possible for us to sell small units of information to each reader on a " customized " basis . WE HAVE THREE delivery systems available and in place : carriers , tradifionol telephone , and the mailman , Let 's start using them differently . Then as new conduit systems such as cable and Interactive audio . visual telephones come on stream , maybe we 'll use ? those , too . The.gate-keepers or owners of these new monopoly electronic highways ? may determine who travels down those roads and at what price . The implications of this development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of information , and its wide distribution , is as important as we think it is . Of the two mass media electronic delivery systems , cable and telephones , the telephone represents our greatest threat and our greatest opportunity . It will take the rest of this decade , or much longer , for cable to wire , and in most cases rewire , the nation with interactive systems . ON THE OTHER hand , Ma Bell 's telephones and others are already in 98 per cent of the homes ; the paired wires coming into your phone dan be souped  --  up to deliver interactive audiovisual services ; the phone ' companies are nationwide in scope . They already have in place the computer and monopoly switching capability to identify , record , invoice , and collect on those 50-cent informationoeeking ? Dial-It phone calls . there 's here 's no reason to hit the panic button , as change seldom comes about abruptly . There are enormous marketing problems to overcome . Standardization of hardware and software is essential U a critical mass of customers is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of business , but our task must be to grow stronger , not weaker , as these changes develop .
