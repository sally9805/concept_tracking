On Saturday afternoon Jockey Chris McCarron brought more than just his riding skills to the saddle . As he left the jockeys ' room at Pimlico Race Course to ride Alysheba in the 112th Preakness Stakes , McCarron spied a little blonde girl waiting on the jockey porch . Eleven-year-old Odessa Clelland is the daughter of Odie Clelland , the venerable trainer under whom McCarron learned his trade . Clelland , whom Alysheba 's trainer , Jack Van Berg , calls " just the finest gentleman who ever lived , " died recently at age 76 , and among the many he left grieving was Odessa . McCarron leaned down and kissed her . // " This one 's for Odie , " he said . // A few minutes and a flawless ride later , McCarron and Alysheba had won one for Odie . Moreover , the Preakness victory , coupled with their win in the Kentucky Derby two weeks before , had earned Alysheba a shot at becoming the 12th winner of the Triple Crown . A win in the Belmont Stakes in New York on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nervous before the Preakness , what with so much at stake , McCarron said , " Was I nervous ? Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back ? " // McCarron slept not a moment on the back of Alysheba , who was even sharper and more aggressive than he had been in his victory at Churchill Downs . " He was much more on the muscle in the post parade , " said McCarron , " and he was much more on the bridle today than he was in the Derby . " // When the gates opened for the Preakness , the two swifties in the nine-horse field , Lookinforthebigone and Harriman , shot to the lead as expected , with Bet Twice and No More Flowers tracking them , and Alysheba , the 2-1 favorite , lying sixth as they swept through the first turn . Down the backside , racing far off the rail with jockey Angel Cordero Jr . and Gulch on his outside , McCarron waited for the speed to tire and begin backing up . He was standing high in the irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the last bend , Alysheba set off for the leaders . For a moment , as Cordero moved with him on Gulch , McCarron glanced left and saw Jose Santos , the rider of the 5-2 second choice , Cryptoclearance , racing into the hunt on the rail . // " I thought he was going to be the horse to beat , " McCarron said later of Cryptoclearance. // As the speed began to wilt near the top of the stretch , jockey Craig Perret moved Bet Twice toward the leaders , and Santos swung Cryptoclearance out between horses to give chase . Santos later said he had had no chance to get off the rail  --  Death Valley for horses at Pimlico in the days preceding the Preakness  --  and Cryptoclearance 's trainer , Scotty Schulhofer , could not believe that Santos had had his colt down inside . " What were you thinking of ? " he cried to Santos after the race . // Turning for home , Perret drove Bet Twice past Lookinforthebigone . At that point he was sure Alysheba would be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was going to be a two-horse race , " Perret said . // The long drive was on . Alysheba moved to the flanks of Bet Twice nearing the eighth pole ; 220 yards from the wire they were head and head . Inside the pole McCarron slashed his horse once righthanded , and Alysheba surged to the lead . With the wire less than 100 yards away , McCarron switched the stick to his left hand and whipped Alysheba four times quickly . The colt drew off in the closing yards to win by half a length . The time of 1:554/5 for the 13/16-mile race was the slowest in the Preakness since 1975. // Van Berg met McCarron and the horse for the walk to the winner 's circle . The trainer removed the blinkers and continued to fuss about with the colt 's head when McCarron yelled down to him , " Oh , hell , Jack , he looks good enough . Let 's go ! " // Looking not bad himself was Alysheba 's breeder , Preston Madden , grandson of the legendary John E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early part of this century , when he was known as the Wizard of the Turf . " You know who bred the first Triple Crown winner ? " Preston Madden asked . Of course . The Wizard bred Sir Barton , who in 1919 became the first horse to win all three races . " I always thought that the emulation of the family tradition was a worthy endeavor , " said Preston . " After 52 years of endeavor , I finally got lucky . " // Two hours later Van Berg had just ordered a vodka and water  --  " in a tall glass , " he told the bartender  --  and was celebrating in a corner of the crowded room when Clarence Scharbauer spotted him . Scharbauer 's wife and daughter , Dorothy and Pamela , are the owners of Alysheba , but no one in the victory party at Pimlico that early evening  --  not Van Berg , not Dorothy nor Pamela nor anyone else  --  appeared quite so caught up in the bright lights of the moment as Scharbauer , a voluble , multimillionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scharbauer called out , " Well , what do you think , Van Berg ? We 're doin ' pretty good so far , are n't we ? " // Van Berg laughed quietly , nodding . " Pretty good , " the trainer said . // " We 're slippin ' and slidin ' , " Scharbauer shouted . " We 're gettin ' there . Can you believe this ? We got two out of three . Now we 've got to get that third one ! " // Ah , yes , the third one  --  the 1-mile Belmont , the last , the longest and perhaps the most searching test in the Triple Crown . Alysheba is the first horse since Pleasant Colony , in 1981 , to come to Belmont in a position to join the most illustrious club in American racing . After winning the Derby and the Preakness , a physically drained Pleasant Colony finished third in the Belmont . Before him , since 1944 , nine others had won the first two jewels and failed to win the last . // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the past . This is the inaugural year of the Triple Crown bonus program , in which horses are awarded points for finishing in the money in each of the three races  --  five points for first , three for second and one point for third . The horse with the most points at the end of the Triple Crown series wins a $1 million bonus . So far , with wins in the first two races , Alysheba has 10 points , while Bet Twice , who has now finished second in both the Derby and Preakness , has six . A horse who wins all three races earns an additional $2.5 million bonus , all on top of the $1.5 million in regular purses awarded the winners of the three events . That comes to a total of $5 million for Alysheba if he wins the Belmont . // For Van Berg the prospect is enough to keep him awake at night . As a trainer who receives 10% of his horse 's earnings , he sees Alysheba 's run for the Triple Crown as more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare privilege , going for that $5 million , " he says . " I think I 'll start sleeping with this horse . " // That Van Berg and the bay son of Alydar would be running for all those marbles on the first Saturday in June seemed almost inconceivable a few weeks ago . Entering the Derby , Alysheba , despite the fact that he had finished out of the money only twice in 10 lifetime starts , had won only one race in his entire career . // This is not the stuff of which Triple Crown candidates are made . But in March a respiratory problem , an entrapped epiglottis , had been discovered and subsequent surgery had cleared the colt 's trachea , giving him room to breathe . Alysheba began running like a different horse . " He has talent and that will to win , " Van Berg said in the week before the Preakness . " In the Derby it was just like he knew he had to get to that wire in front . That 's how determined he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through there . It was like he had a goal line to get to and there was nobody going to get in his way . " // If Alysheba 's performance at Churchill Downs confirmed for Van Berg that he had something special on his hands , doubts about the horse lingered in the days leading up to the Preakness . At Pimlico there were ominous whisperings that Alysheba had lost the sheen to his coat and that his workout two days before the Preakness ( half a mile in a lackluster 503/5 seconds ; Van Berg had wanted a 47-second run such as the one the horse had given him before the Derby ) indicated that the colt may have been tailing off in form . After all , he had run two grueling races , the Blue Grass Stakes and the Derby , in a period of nine days , and here he was racing again just two weeks later . Not a robust sort , built rather along the lines of a deer , Alysheba had n't carried much excess flesh to begin with and appeared leaner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not appear to concern Van Berg . " He went a little bit slower than I thought he would go , " the trainer said , " but I 'd rather have him go a little too slow and save himself than go too fast and take it all out of him . But he 's fit enough . " // Nonetheless , knowing how horses can make liars of men , Van Berg hedged a bit on his bet . " We do n't know how much this horse had to use of himself in the Derby , " he said . " He may come in here and throw in a clinker ' cause he overdone himself in the Derby . Whether he overdone himself , I do n't know . Sometimes horses will run a giant race and they 've overdone themselves and do n't come back . But ... he has n't missed a kernel of oat . Acts good . Feels good . " // Van Berg himself had clearly not missed an oat , either , since the Derby , and throughout the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of a country-boy raconteur , which he is . Mixing tales from his past with self-deprecating wit , he bantered cheerily with the press . When Eddie Donnelly , who covers racing for The Dallas Morning News , asked a question using the word " indicative , " Van Berg interrupted him : " Use smaller words , will ya , Eddie ? I got kicked out of school . " // While commenting on Alysheba 's penchant for stopping to gaze quietly at whatever might be happening around him , Van Berg interrupted his own discussion and mused , " I 've always been that way myself , enjoying watching other people work . My father always said I 'd make a good old man ' cause I saved myself when I was young . " // Banter aside , it is precisely Alysheba 's poised demeanor that has served to save him in his Triple Crown campaign . " He do n't make any false moves or jumps , " Van Berg said . " Just goes out on the track , does his business , and comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out there and stand on the racetrack for two hours , and he shows no emotion . He does n't show any emotion until I blow him out a day or two before a race . Then he knows he 's gon na run . " // In the Belmont , Alysheba will have to run farther than he ever has before . And he will have to do it without benefit of Lasix , a diuretic administered to him before the Derby and Preakness but which is banned in New York . Used to reduce blood pressure in bleeders by inducing urination , Lasix is widely perceived as a drug that enhances a horse 's overall racing performance . Van Berg scoffs at the notion , saying he gave Alysheba Lasix only to help empty the colt 's bladder before the race to avoid discomfort . " The medication do n't mean crap , " he says . // What Alysheba needs is time to rest from the rigors of his campaign and to prepare for the Belmont . " We 've got to settle down and train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to go that mile and a half . " Van Berg should get his horse there , even if he has to sleep with him .
