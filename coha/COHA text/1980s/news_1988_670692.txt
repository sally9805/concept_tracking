As the conventional war has blossomed , so too have the intertwined conflicts fought by a plethora of groups : fractious Kurdish separatists allied with Iran against Iraq , Iraqi-backed Iranian adversaries of Teheran ' s Islamic revolution and Iranian-supported Iraqi Shiite Moslems pitted against Baghdad. // The United Nations-sponsored peace talks between Iran and Iraq that are under way in Geneva , however , have opened a prospect that those forces will now become bargaining chips in the wider negotiations , diplomats and Iraqi officials said. // In recent weeks , moreover , Iraq appears to have coupled a conventional military drive against Iran with maneuvers in the proxy war designed to strengthen its hand in Geneva , promoting its own surrogates and attacking Teheran ' s. // // Restraining the Surrogates // In Geneva , Iraqi officials and Western diplomats said , a critical issue will be insuring that neither side interferes in the affairs of the other . Implicitly that means reining in the surrogates. // The issue is to be negotiated as part of an overall peace package supposed to cement a United Nations-sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently holding. // As the truce approached , Western diplomats said , Iraq followed up a string of battlefield successes with what appears to have been a concerted maneuver in the proxy war. // In June and July , Iraq helped the dissident Iranian movement , the People ' s Mujahedeen , take some cities from Iran . Baghdad followed up with a major drive against Iranian-backed Kurdish separatists in the north. // The result , according to a senior Iraqi official , was to further reverse the power balance that enabled Iran to exact concessions from Iraq when the two sides made their last major deal in 1975. // At that time , President Saddam Hussein of Iraq traded Baghdad ' s total control over the Shatt al Arab waterway at the northern tip of the gulf for a withdrawal of Iranian support for a Kurdish campaign in the north . The concession , some regional specialists say , still rankles the Iraqi leader as a humiliation to be redressed . <> <> Bargaining Chips // " The Kurds are no longer a bargaining chip and Iraq still has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a senior Iraqi official , who declined to be identified. // The new balance , compared to 1975 , he said , meant that Iraq no longer felt obliged to " trade off part of the national land. " // Such interpretations , Western diplomats said , suggest a hard negotiating stance in Geneva . " The Iraqis will be very precise and very tough , " a Western envoy said , " because they think it is the only thing the Iranians understand. " // The Iraqi maneuver has left smaller groups in the border war in ambivalent positions. // In their campaign against the Kurds , said a regional diplomat knowledgeable about the mountainous area in the north , " we got the impression that the Iraqis wanted to finish the whole business. " // Thousands of villages have been razed in the region to deny sanctuary to the guerrillas of Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani. // Additionally , in late July , a Western military specialist said Iraq dispatched 20 , 000 elite forces to the north . " The mopping-up intensified , " the specialist said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mujahedeen , which opposed the Shah ' s rule in Iran but was crushed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the Islamic revolution , seems more complex. // In June 1987 , the Mujahedeen ' s leader , Massoud Rajavi , announced the formation of a National Liberation Army of Iran , thought by Western specialists to number no more than 16 , 000 men and women . The organization ' s tactic was to use military raids into Iran as a means of fomenting revolt and underpinning a campaign for recognition - in Iran and elsewhere - as the only viable alternative to the clerical Government in Teheran. // After probing raids last year and early this year , the group - armed and sponsored by Iraq - briefly occupied the border town of Mehran in June and , in July , made forays between 50 and 80 miles into Iran , holding the towns of Kerend and Islamabad for several days. // Western diplomats said that , in the July campaign , Iraq had offered the Mujahedeen a final chance to establish " liberated areas " inside Iran. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mujahedeen spokesman here , called it " our largest and most successful operation so far . " <> <> ' They Just Got Wiped Out ' // But a Western diplomat said , " They just got wiped out. " // " The Iranians sent in reinforcement and the Mujahedeen took a beating , " another Western military specialist said . " Even by their own count they took 1 , 000 casualties . " The Mujahedeen claimed to have inflicted 40 , 000 Iranian casualties. // " I don ' t think we ' ll see further offensives soon , " the Western specialist said. // That represents a harsh blow to the group ' s strategy . With its forces in Iraq , Mujahedeen officials suggest , their main option is to hope that an end to the war with Iraq will destabilize the Teheran regime sufficiently to give Mr. Rajavi ' s supporters an opening. // Since the offensive in July , Iran has reportedly executed scores of Mujahedeen supporters - many by public hanging - and denounced the movement in public - a tacit acknowledgement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Mujahedeen have learned to take proper tactics when and if necessary , " he said . " We have always adjusted tactics in our fighting . The form of fighting is secondary . " <> <> MORE CHEMICAL ATTACKS REPORTED // LONDON , Aug. 27 ( Reuters ) - Kurdish rebels said today that the Iraqi Army had killed 200 people and wounded 1 , 000 others in chemical raids this week on Kurdish strongholds along the Turkish border. // A spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iraq said Iraqi planes and helicopters had attacked 17 villages in northern Dihok Province on Thursday and Friday . Mustard gas was used in the raids , he said. //
