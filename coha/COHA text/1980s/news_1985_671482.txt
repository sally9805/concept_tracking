Jean-Louis Missud , the owner , decided to do something about that reputation and sent out a posse to capture a talented chef . They found their man toiling behind a stove at La Cote Basque and took him back - not only alive , but full of enthusiasm and ideas for the challenge ahead. // Andre Gaillard , a 33-year-old native of Burgundy , has managed in just a few months to revitalize the menu with his refined and serendipitous style of cooking . Like an eighth-place baseball club that acquires a powerhouse cleanup batter in mid-season , team players at La Reserve show a new pride . They have a spring in their step and a snap in their style that reflects renewed hope. // While Mr. Gaillard ' s cooking orientation is strongly classical , his touch is light . This is evident in some of his appetizers , such as the warm lobster and asparagus flan , which is an ethereal delight infused with shellfish flavor and garnished with a diadem of lobster morsels . It is presented in a pool of tangy watercress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its slight sharpness cut through the rich lobster flavor like a razor , yielding a vivid taste sensation. // His most dazzling creation , a special , was the seafood charlotte . It consisted of a silky sole mousse cooked in a charlotte mold and filled with pieces of scallops , shrimp , tomato and mushroom , seasoned with flecks of fresh tarragon . Clinging to the surface were strips of carrots and turnips . The sauce , a beurre blanc garnished with laces of pousse-pied , a seaweed from Brittany , formed a tableau that was as arresting as it was delicious. // Less elaborate starters included slices of fresh salmon and calico scallops marinated with dill , and a delectable slab of fresh foie gras sauteed with hydromel ( a fermented honey mixture ) , garnished with baby vegetables and served with a crunchy potato basket filled brim-high with woodsy wild mushrooms . In the near-miss department were a chewy lobster salad and a pate of duck liver that left an acrid aftertaste. // One of the soups sampled - jellied lobster-tail flavored with chili peppers - was outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspic soup , intensely flavored with lobster essence , was as briny and refreshing as an ocean spray , and the pinch of chili added a rousing extra dimension. // A crew of mostly veteran European waiters provides sharp and attentive service . The captains are familiar with the wine list , which is a bit pricey on the lower end of the scale but offers a good range. // Mr. Gaillard happily does not belong to what might be called the " kitchen sink " school of cooking - a little of this and a little of that and a little more of this until the dish is so cluttered one ' s palate goes tilt like a pinball machine . His fish preparations , for example , are well focused and straightforward . A crisp-skinned grilled fillet of red mullet was memorable , with the judicious addition of clove giving a subtle zip to the sauce . A sprinkling of fresh coriander did the same with a beurre blanc-coated poached salmon . But turbot with lemon grass and caviar fell flat because the fish was overcooked and the lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , get the regal poached Dover sole : two firm and fresh fillets sandwiched around a well-seasoned layer of creamy artichoke mousse . The fillets , embellished with threads of various root vegetables and slivers of truffles , were served in a glossy pool of beurre blanc dotted with tiny lobster-filled ravioli. // In the meat category , you can enjoy a good roasted duck with a gingered cranberry sauce , tender filets of lamb in an aromatic saffron and mint sauce , equally good veal in a sherry vinegar sauce , and a wonderfully earthy fricassee of veal kidneys and sweetbreads with red cabbage in a mild curry sauce. // Mr. Gaillard is not beyond a little showmanship on occasion . One special was quail cooked in clay . Beaming like a new father , he brought to our table an ornate platter holding two entombed little birds . The quail were exceptionally moist and slightly gamy , stuffed with a tasty combination of sweetbreads , foie gras and mushrooms . Their lustrous sauce combined Madeira , foie gras and capers. // Desserts are copious and ever-changing . Tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor of that tropical fruit under an unsweetened soft meringue lid . Equally good was the warm , ripe pear enclosed in phyllo sheets that folded open at the top like a budding flower , surrounded by a semi-sweet chocolate sauce . Other winners include the plum tart with fresh raspberry sauce , an intensely fruity Bavaroise of raspberries , and moist carrot and pistachio layer cake veined with whipped cream . Exceptions were a dark and textureless version of creme brulee , a sodden-crusted apple tart and a run-of-the-mill chocolate cake topped with a dry cream puff La Reserve ' s two dining rooms are as enchanting as ever , with their beige- and peach-colored banquettes , high ceiling , giant paintings of birds in marshlands and soft lighting . With the marked improvement in food , La Reserve has moved out of the shadows and can stand tall among its towering French confreres. // La Reserve // * // * // * 4 West 49th Street , ( 247-2993 ) Atmosphere : Elegant cafe-like dining rooms with comfortable fabric banquettes , oversized paintings and soft lighting. // Service : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Recommended dishes : Warm lobster and asparagus flan , seafood charlotte , fresh salmon and scallops marinated in dill , fresh foie gras sauteed with hydromel , jellied lobster-tail soup , grilled mullet with clove and butter sauce ; poached salmon fillet with coriander butter sauce , Dover sole with artichoke mousse , roast duck with gingered cranberry sauce , lamb filets in saffron and mint sauce , veal medallions with sherry vinegar sauce , fricassee of veal kidneys and sweetbread with cabbage in curry sauce , quail roasted in clay , mango mousse , warm pear in phyllo sheets. // Price range : Prix-fixe lunch , $26 ; pre-theater dinner , $29 ; dinner , $35 . <> <> Credit cards : All major cards // Hours : Lunch Monday through Saturday noon to 3 P.M. ; dinner Monday through Saturday 7 to 11 P.M. ; pre-theater dinner Monday through Saturday from 5 : 30 to 7 .
