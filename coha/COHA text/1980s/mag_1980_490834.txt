THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and . Comment THE Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ( an act of war , costing thousands of lives and destroying the independence of a nation ) and the American gold-medal victory in Olympic hockey , coming shortly after our defeat of the favored Soviet team ( a triumph in a sporting match ) , were , by any rational accounting , events of different orders of magnitude , belonging to separate and incommensurable realms of human experience ; but in the thoughts and emotions of millions of Americans last week , try as they would to keep a sense of proportion , the two events uncontrollably gut mixed up together  --  as though the United States , after considerable futile groping around , had at last found an appropriate response to the Soviet aggression . Absurd as it may be to imagine that the success of six men in shooting a puck into a goal has anything whatever to do with the balance of political and military forces in the world , it must be said in defense of this country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  including , especially , the earliest Olympic times , in ancient Greece  --  sports and war , though never mistaken for one another ( the mistake that Americans seem inclined to make at the moment ) , were nonetheless closely related . Both called for daring and for physical prowess ; both were contests in which a clear victor emerged ; both offered young men the chance to win glory through the achievement of a kind of excellence ; and both were celebrated in poetry and in the arts . The New Columbia Encyclopedia informs us that Greek states were sometimes " prouder of Olympic victories than of winning battles . " Also , sports were long a training ground for war ( in the nineteenth century it was claimed that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton ) , and at times sporting events were regarded as substitutes for war : the early Olympic Games were ceremonies in which former enemies could meet in peace . Sports were a sort of bloodless war  --  war kept within certain agreed-upon bounds . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because sports have changed but because war has changed . In the opinion of Hans Morgenthau , a war that was conducted with nuclear weapons would be so different from any previous conflict that the word " war " would simply be a misnomer . As it happens , it is precisely the points of resemblance to sports  --  what might be called war 's better side that have been Inst to war . Physical strength and skill , strategic brilliance , and personal courage have all been rendered superfluous , together with the combatants themselves , who would hardly have time to report for duty or put on their uniforms in the half hour or less that it would take for intercontinental ballistic missiles , travelling at some fifteen thousand miles an hour , to reach their targets . Nor would it require talent or bravery to push the button that would send these missiles on their way . ( So thoroughly have weapons replaced men that when one nuclear missile is lost in the explosion of another , the experts call it " fratricide . " ) Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both sports and war , have been taken away from war by the new weapons , since these submerge both sides in unlimited destruction . All that is left is the killing . And it is this same deprivation of war 's traditional forms and uses which has bedevilled our country 's attempts to find a response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . The problem is an excess of means  --  on both sides . To use a sports analogy , it is as though one were trying to play hockey with a hundred men on each team , a thousand pucks in the rink , no goalkeeping allowed , and no time limit Now that the United States and the Soviet Union can annihilate each other , threats of direct military challenge , though they are often made , have a hollow ring , no matter which side makes them , because everyone knows that the threatener has as much to lose as the threatened  --  namely , everything . On the other hand , more oblique retaliation , such as the American grain embargo or the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that becomes ironic in view of the importance that Americans have attached to our hockey victory at Lake Placid ) , seems inadequate and oddly remote from the challenge it is supposed to meet . In the circumstances , it may not he surprising that the public , in an effusion of benign patriotic euphoria , has found its consolation in sports . There , at least , courage , skill , and even victory  --  nonexistent on the modern field of battle  --  are still possible . W ords THE big news in office work these days is word processing . On a recent Sunday , in fact , the help-wanted section of the Times rail more than four columns of ads offering jobs to people in word processing , whereas on a Sunday five years ago ( March 16 , 1975 ) it ran no ads at all in that category . Word processing is clearly " wave-of-the-future stuff , " as we were told by an enthusiastic sales representative at the International Word Processing Association Spring Symposium , held last week at the Hilton . Moreover , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read in a promotional leaflet we picked up at the symposium ? " the greatest thing since sliced bread . " Word processing  --  or ) . VP , as it is often called is work done by people known as word processors , or as word-processor operators , on machines that are also known as word processors , or as word-processing machines . And these machines , though they are available in many models  --  for instance , some have video screens and some do not  --  are in essence electronically bolstered typewriters that can store typed material , can he instructed to alter the stored material in a variety of ways , and can automatically reproduce the stored material again and again , operating as efficiently as good bread-slicing machines . On the day we visited the symposium , there were speeches and seminars going on in some of the hotel 's meeting rooms , but we decided to spend our time at the west end of the second floor , where several hundred word-processing machines were being exhibited . While about a thousand visitors milled around , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue or gray or beige , and also past a lot of enthusiastic-looking male and female sales representatives , most of whom wore suits that were either blue or gray or beige . There were , in addition , a good many word-processing accessories on display things like print-wheels , floppy discs , mag card files , and diskette folders . And there was a lot of promotional literature being handed out . We picked up some of it , and read : Add Alphaword to your VP system , and cut your turnaround time in half . If you can make sense out of it , chances are  --  so can the Pagereader . It reads ordinary Courier 12 typewriter type , just like you . ( In addition to OCRA , OCRB , and ECRM Legal . ) The AMtext 425 will grow as your word processing needs grow . You can add the 425A , for example , It has all the features of the 425 , without the printer . The days of the office typing pool are almost over , having been replaced by word processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's online program development system for DOS/VS/VSE , enabled one user to increase programmer productivity 50% while cutting staff by 50% . TYPEREADER 2 is sold and serviced by most word processing systems manufacturers . HENDRIX also provides interfaces for IBM , WANG , XEROX , and DEC systems . Today , word processing makes it possible to move , file , edit and communicate more words in an hour than were used to write the Bible . We took some notes in our notebook , with a pencil . Then we moved along to examine some of the video screens that were mounted above many of the machines ' keyboards . Most of the screens displayed green letters and numerals on a black field , but some displayed blue letters and numerals on black , and at least one displayed black letters and numerals on azure . One of the most attractive displays  --  emeraldgreen printing on a velvety-black field , on the screen of a machine in the exhibit of the Lexitron Corporation  --  read " LINE 17 SPACE 12 16% FULL BTSYNC COMM-POINT TO POINT-LOCAL Disk Identification : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , we stopped at an exhibit of the Olsten Corporation , which is a temporary-employment service , and whose booth contained no word-processing equipment  --  just some promotional literature and four enthusiastic-looking representatives . We spoke to one of them , a man in a brown suit , who told us that he was Irving K. Schwartz , an executive at the company 's headquarters , in Westbury . We asked him why a temporary-employment service had an exhibit at a word-processing symposium . " We supply the people , " Mr. Schwartz replied . " The need for people to operate word processors has grown tremendously in the past few years . Recently , Olsten began training people in WP all over the country . Many office workers already have some of the minimum skills , which we break down this way : typewriting ability , editorial English efficiency , word-processing input-output , word-processing automatic typing , word-processing major revising , and word-processing merging . Although many of the machines nowadays are extremely sophisticated  --  some are hooked into computer networks  --  a word processor is really just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retyping it , pur suant to your instructions . Basically , it 's the simplest thing in the world . " Winter Pond ACOUNTRY friend of ours writes : My husband and I wanted to do things properly when we moved to our peaceful country retreat , so first we got a wood stove and then we got a horse . We dug a pond to go with the horse , but before long the horse moved to southern Ohio , where it 's warmer , and left us with a frozen spot in the pasture As it turns out , this has been a good winter for ice , so the pond has kept us busy . When it comes to ice-skating , the pond is a two-person deal . It 's just large enough to skate around on without getting dizzy . But the other day our two dogs were on hand , swerving obediently out of our paths , and a few fearless cats joined us , their tails in danger of being sliced by skate blades . This whole crowded scene was a little like bumper cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept sailing across the field into the bushes . The dogs caddied . One of the cats was an exceptional player . The day was bright and windless , and we were warm and happy . The next day , a Sunday , a scheduled northeast snowstorm started scattering flakes here and there . Adventurously , we drove away to a brunch . Brunches are few and far between out here in the country , but we often read about them in the Times restaurant ads , and so they are exaggerated in our fantasies . On our way , dodging snowflakes , we picked up the Sunday Times to see what had happened to the world . We tossed the headlines and the brunch ads into the back seat of the car . The snow had stopped . At the brunch , up a winding , dead-end road , the guests rejoiced over travelling without chains on their tires . They all kept an eye on the windows . There was talk of the weird southerly direction of this winter 's snow . A woman in a ski sweater laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Various recycled Three Mile Island jokes surfaced . As all of us watched for the storm , our suspicions grew , darting forth like old headlines seen on microfilm . The host had had the silver appraised and was afraid of thieves . Someone had dreamed of F.B.I . agents surrounding a church . We debated the latest news on dinosaurs  --  that they were wiped out by the effects of a crashing asteroid . Everybody knew that it would n't snow . ? ? The house had a now wood-burning furnace , because of conspiracies about oil . The owner is a teacher , with a habit of grading papers in odd places . He had set up his worktable in the basement , so he could stoke the furnace conveniently and keep an eye on the silver The brunch included Austrian cinnamon coffee , shirred eggs , jelly roll from the " joy of Cooking , " Bloody Marys , and sherry  --  the works . The newspapers were hiding in the basement . Boldly , we played a board game called Risk , the object of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours . ( This game is a lot like bumper cars . ) As the Middle East fell to India , we left for home , carting along the unread Sunday Times . The aftermath of a brunch is customarily a nap , but we headed for the pond with our skates . The sun was shining . The promised snow had gone out to sea , or perhaps down to Alabama . To our surprise , the pond was gleaming , as if it had melted , though the temperature was twenty . The dogs ran ahead to investigate . A cat trotted out onto the pond and then stopped abruptly , paw-deep in water . The pond had cracked and was leaking . The center was a puddle . This was not really so amazing . Ice does crack . Sometimes thunderous roars within a pond can knock you off balance . But then we saw a dark hole in the center . The water was seeping up through a pretty , round hole , about seven inches in diameter , cut through three inches of ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . Had someone been ice-fishing ? There were no footprints . It occurred to us that the ice was unusually thin . We wondered if a hot spring could he underneath . " Can ponds do this ? " we asked the neighbors . We did n't really know about ponds . It was our first one . The neighbors smiled . They had never seen a winter like this one , they said , shaking their heads . Someone said that ice does strange things anyway . Vaguely , we recalled the jet fighter planes that sometimes come screaming low through the valley . We thought of Skylabs , meltdowns , deep-sixing , krypton , asteroids , meteorites . But if meteorites hit , they make diamondsso the Soviets are reporting , in reference to that ancient large hole in Siberia . In the spring , we decided , we 'd look for the diamonds . We went back to the house , to burn wood and read the Times , T he Shave WHAT has happened to the shave in barbershops ? We looked into the question last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that roughly one out of three still offers the shave to customers , and at the following representative prices : James , Hairstylist to Men , at the Plaza ? $8 . Paul Mole 's , 1021 Lexington Ave-n ue ? $ 6 . Jerry , Hairstylist to Men , at Bergdorf ? $5 . Monique of the Waldorf ? $5 . Johnny 's Barber Shop , 2 Park Avenue ? $3.25 ; $3.75 with tonics . Ritz-Carlton Barber Shop , Boston ? $5 . Arcade Hair Stylists , 25 West Forty-third Street ? $4.50 . Many barbershops started putting out " NO SHAVE " signs about twenty years ago , for reasons that , according to the barbers we consulted , included the arrival of the chromium blade ; the arrival of the electric razor ; the arrival of long-hair styles and the heard ; the popularization of unisex barbershops and beauty parlors ; the large number of men who were in the armed forces in the Second World War and had to start shaving themselves and then , it turned out , did n't give up shaving themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barbershops where shaves are still given , some are given by barbers who use the old-fashioned straight steel razor , which is known in the profession as the " cutthroat " razor . Most of the shaves are given with a razor that looks like the old-fashioned straight razor but has a disposable chromium blade . For customers who request shaves with a genuine old-fashioned straight razor , about half the shops that give shaves have barbers who know how to hone the razor on a stone , smooth it on a two-piece canvas-and-leather strop , and then give the shave . A few barbershops , like Jerry at Bergdorf , refuse to give a shave with anything but the straight razor . " We have Ambassador Frederic Mann and Selig Burrows and Jule Styne , and they want the real thing , " Miss Katherine King , the manager of Jerry , told us . " We do at least six shaves a day . We 're doing more now than we did ten years ago . The shave is coming hack . We give the closest shave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie Dussol , the manager , told us that ten per cent of her customers get shaves but that only one of them , a businessman named Charles Beer , insists on being shaved with the old-fashioned straight razor . " He can feel the difference , " Mrs. Dussol told us . In order to give shaves in this city , a barber must have a Master Barber MARCH 1 0 1 9 8O license issued by the State of New York . Requirements for the license are : attending a barber school for six months and working as an apprentice in a barbershop for eighteen months , or working as an apprentice in a barbershop for twenty-four months  --  and then taking and passing an examination given by the Division of Licensing of New York 's State Department . This examination consists of a practical demonstration and an oral test , and includes a section on the shave : applying the lather , sharpening the razor with the strop , and shaving with the straight razor . Applying hot towels is not included . Most people who cut hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a beauty school for a thousand hours , pass a hairdressing test , and get a Cosmetology license , But Cosmetology graduates are not allowed to do shaves . ( The New York State Department of Education , which supervises and licenses beauty schools , informed us that " beauty school " is " the generic term " for " cosmetology school , " and that the shave is not part of the cosmetology-school curriculum . ) At the Atlas Barber School , at 44 Third Avenue , which is the only classic , shave-teaching barber school left in the city , Matthew Raguso , the director and co-owner , told us that at the moment he has forty-five students , all of whom are studying , among other things , the shave . Mr. Raguso told us that he has been in charge of the school since 1957 . Tuition is $1,935 for a thousand hours of instruction , of which three hundred are devoted to teaching the shave . Upon enrollment , each student gets a kit of tools . Along with a pair of scissors , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kit holds a straight razor , a hone , and a strop . Mr. Raguso told us that he is a faithful devotee of the old-fashioned shave . " Here we teach , The customer can feel the shave , " Mr. Raguso told us . " We teach , It is very important to get the right lather , very important to get a lather machine that gives the right lather . Very important , because we do n't use brushes anymore . We teach , It is very important to tell whether a heard is a soft heard or a tough heard . Very important how to use the hot towels to soften the tough beard . Then we teach how to strop on canvas , how to strop on leather  --  five strokes on each side . We teach , The shave is artistic . With a straight razor . " " What about disposable blades in the imitation straight razor ? " we asked . " Garbage ! " Mr. Raguso said . We called up Jerry Spallina , who started Jerry at Bergdorf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , at Le Club International , and he told us that nobody in Fort Lauderdale ever asks for a shave . " I 'm now in this beautiful place . It used to he owned by John Brown , of Kentucky Fried Chicken , who just married Phyllis George , and now he 's the governor of Kentucky , so he ca n't own this place anymore , " Jerry explained to us on the phone . " When I had my shop in the Squibb Building , at 745 Fifth Avenue , and then my shop at Fifty-fourth and Madison , I always used to send a barber up to shave old Mr. Goodman at Bergdorf Goodman . Now the shave is gone with the horse and buggy . " " We used to soap up the outside of balloons and make our students shave them , " Paul Ferrara , who runs the Robert Fiance Hair Design Institute , at 405 Fifth Avenue , told us . " But shaving is no longer a part of our repertoire . " Paul Mole 's barbershop , now seventy-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. Wood told us he still gives shaves , but not many . " The clean look is in again , but our clientele , mostly hankers and stockbrokers , never abandoned the clean look in the first place , " Mr. Wood said . " But these are people who like to shave themselves . They do n't come to the barber for a hot towel . They 're smart . They know they can go home and get the same result with a hot shower . " Monique of the Waldorf told us that her shop still gives shaves , with the old-fashioned straight razor , but not so often these days . " Customers who used to live in the Towers would come in here daily for a shave , " she said . " James Farley . For over thirty years , he came in every morning at eight o'clock . Now the shave is almost extinct . " We wanted to know how the shave stood in Boston . " Thirty-four years ago , we used to do seventy-five shaves a day , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told us over the telephone . " Now we aver-age four , maybe five a day . It has always been a ritual with executives , the type that has more time . The late James N. B. Hill , grandson of the railroad tycoon . People like that . Once , I had three kings in here at the same moment  --  Peter of Yugo-slavia , Michael of Rumania , and Leo-the Belgians , all chatting while sitting in the barber ? the owner of the Arcade Hair Stylists , downstairs in our building , said when we asked him how many regular customers he had for shaves . " He 's Larry Stevens , of Stevens Personnel , on Fifth Avenue . He comes every Friday . We use the chromium blade . He rests . Otherwise , it 's a dead item . " We told Kenneth , of Kenneth 's , at 19 East Fifty-fourth Street , which was one of the first of the glamorous beauty salons to open its doors to unisex , about our study . Ten per cent of his clients now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , in three years , has ever asked for a shave . The hotbed of old-fashioned shaves seems , from our quick survey , to he Johnny 's , at 2 Park Avenue . There we talked to a master barber named Vito Moles , who used to have his own shop , around the corner at 152 Madison Avenue , and who has been a barber for fifty-two years . When we arrived , we found a young man wearing blue-jeans lying in one of the shop 's eight barber chairs and getting shaved . A splendid-looking copper-and-chromium towel sterilizer stood off to one side . The name " Bramhall Deane Co. " was engraved on the cover in script " It 's sixty years old , " Mr. Moles told us . " Good as new . Nothing like a nice hot towel over the face to give you relaxation . First I give the hot towel , then the lather , then another hot towel , then the shave , then the hot towel again . The men who come here as regulars know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shave Louis Helpern , in the underwear business . At eight , I shave Moe Mitchell , also in the underwear business . I 've shaved four generations of Mitchells . Every afternoon at three , I shave Mur ? ray Singer , of the piece-goods business . Our manager , Joe Chiusano , shaves Harold Sachs , of the handbags business . Martin Fein , the auctioneer . Sidney Blaine , sportswear . These men do n't know how to shave themselves . Every time they try it , they need a doctor . When they come in on Monday , after being on their own , they look like a porcupine . The sideburns are cockeyed . The hair is left on . They look terrible . " Jack Hausman , the vice-chairman of the hoard of Belding H emin way ( threads , literally ) , is one of the Johnny 's regulars . We telephoned him at a hotel in Palm Springs , where he was taking a little vacation . " Vito has been shaving me for years and years , and I 've never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss Vito . It 's restful to get a shave . I take a little nap . The hot towel is comforting , especially in winter . I started working at the age of fourteen , for my father , M. Hausman , at 110 Grand Street . The barber was a block away . I went there for a shave , because my father and my older brother went there for a shave , I followed the same procedure . When we moved uptown to East Thirty-second Street , we all started going to Vito , around the corner . I always go at nine-thirty in the morning . I 'm not happy doing it any other way . I have breakfast every morning with my wife , Ethel , in Peacock Alley , at the Waldorf , and I walk every morning to work on East Thirty-second Street . I 've been doing that for years and years , too . I do n't like change . Here , I really miss Vito . I 'm not getting shaved here . I look like a porcupine . I look @ @ @
