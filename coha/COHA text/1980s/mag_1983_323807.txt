Intense pressure to quit <P> After James Watt took off last week on what his aides insisted was a " long-scheduled " vacation in California , Washington buzzed with this question : Would he ever return as Secretary of the Interior ? The answer from Ronald Reagan 's White House staff : Probably . But whether it would be for more than a few days was another matter . <P> Ever since his flippant remark three weeks ago about the presence of " a black , a woman , two Jews and a cripple " ( see ESSAY ) on his coal-leasing commission , Watt 's chances of staying in office have ebbed almost daily . The Secretary long ago alienated the left and center with his policy of opening vast tracts of Government-owned land to commercial exploitation . Now the Republican right fears that he will be a 1984 campaign liability to G.O.P candidates . <P> Democrats last week introduced a " sense of the Senate " resolution , to be taken up next week , demanding Watt 's ouster . Republican Senators met for their regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watt out . It had been thought that dismissing Watt would anger Western conservatives , an important constituency for Reagan . But at the lunch , one Western Senator after another reported that the Interior Secretary had lost his popularity among their constituents , and that appeared to decide the matter . Said one Republican later : " He 's gone . " <P> In a Senate speech , the G.O.P. 's Slade Gorton of Washington put some of his colleagues ' thinking on the record . Gorton called Watt " a failure on his own terms , a destructively divisive force in American society , an albatross around the neck of his own President . " The message got through to Watt . After the Republican lunch , Alan Simpson of Wyoming , a close friend of the Interior Secretary 's , discussed with Watt what the Senators had said . Simpson quoted Watt as asserting , " I ca n't believe the viciousness of their remarks . " <P> As late as the end of September , White House aides were predicting that Watt would ride out the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt he will last the month . Reagan is exceedingly reluctant to fire Watt under pressure . The President remarked last week that the Secretary had " done a fine job " and did not deserve to be ousted for " a stupid remark . " White House Spokesman Larry Speakes said that Reagan would not feel bound by a Senate vote on whether Watt should go , however it might come out . <P> Watt said nothing , but Reagan 's aides believe he will resign rather than face Senate condemnation , and they would like to delay the vote in order to permit additional time for a more graceful exit . Watt is said to have given his top aides at Interior the green light to look for new jobs . Indeed , presidential aides are already speculating about a new job for Watt on Reagan 's re-election committee .
