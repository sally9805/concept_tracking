Detroit 's automakers have been trying lately to break into the market for $50,000-plus prestige cars  --  a lucrative slice of the business completely dominated by the Europeans . General Motors ' first entry was last year 's $56,533 Cadillac Allante , which is designed and partly assembled in Italy . The Allante has flopped in the marketplace , but GM does not give up easily . Early next year the company will introduce a souped-up version of the Corvette , called the ZR1 . <P> When it rolls off the assembly line in Bowling Green , Ky. , the ZR1 will become the first $50,000 production car built entirely in the U.S. GM is not saying much about its new roadster , but Car and Driver magazine claims the ZR1 will hit 190 m.p.h. , which would put it in a class with the best European performers . The current top-of-the-line Corvette reaches only 159 m.p.h. and costs $34,820.
