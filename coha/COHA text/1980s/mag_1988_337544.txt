In the summer of 1981 , California State Judge Eugene Lynch asked San Francisco Attorney E. Robert Wallach to talk to his good friend Edwin Meese , then White House Counsellor , about helping the judge get an appointment to the federal bench . Wallach says it was " likely " that he did so . At a hearing on Sept. 17 of that year , Lynch orally approved a payment of $1 million to Wallach 's law firm as its part of a $1.74 million out-of-court settlement won by the firm for two girls who had been badly burned in a tent fire . The following January Lynch was chosen to become a federal district judge . <P> While those facts , reported last week by the San Francisco Chronicle , were not denied , Lynch insisted that there was no connection between his promotion and Wallach 's generous award . Lynch said he had not approved the fee in writing and had referred the matter in December to another judge . After the father of one of the girls objected to paying the lawyers 57% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second judge in 1982 reduced their fee to $322,000 . The California state bar is reportedly investigating Wallach 's firm for seeking the high payment . The office of Independent Counsel James McKay said it was examining the Lynch appointment as part of its ongoing investigation of Attorney General Meese.
