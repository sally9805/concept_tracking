txt HIII MING-TEII is sitting between gravestones in a weed-filled cemetery , and he has a big grin on his handsome , bow-jawed face . It is the grin of a man laughing at death and pretending to claim his own gravesite . Date : Nov. 9 , 1979 . The photograph was taken by his wife , Linda , during a visit they made to a prison island off the southern coast of Taiwan . A rumor among Taiwan 's political opposition has it that the cemetery holds the remains of political prisoners ; people once like themselves , the rumor goes , but people who had gone too far . And that is why Shih Ming-teh , a political activist with powerful oratorical skills and organizing abilities , is sitting there with a grin on his face , gallows humor on his mind , and the rough sense of a question dancing in his eyes : How far is too far ? The next slide fills the screen with rows of young Taiwanese riot policemen encircling an unauthorized Human Rights Day demonstration in the southern port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their helmets and their lower legs are visible behind the long riot shields held edge-to-edge in a wobbly wall of brushed metal . It is night , and there are drifting clouds of tear gas settling on an angry , panicky crowd of thousands of demonstrators . Somewhere in that rioting crowd is Shih Ming-teh and Linda Gail Arrigo Shih . They were members of the group that planned the demonstration . Infact , Shih Ming-teh was the chief architect . Date : Dec. 10 , 1979 . THIS HAS COME io be known as the Kaohsiung incident . In the annals of Taiwan 's political opposition it marks the biggest confrontation in 30 years with the Nationalist government . At least 184 were injured ? mostly policemen , the government says . But even more important , the incident has led to a widespread crackdown on Taiwan 's burgeoning democratic movement coalition . At the end of last week , 59 people , including several opposition legislators , lawyers , writers , editors , and political candidates , were still under arrest . Some may be tried on sedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to his own question , will almost certainly be among them . But Linda Arrigo Shih is here . It is a bitterly cold Sunday morning in Oak Brook , and she is in a darkened motel meeting room with 35 Taiwanese-American doctors and their wives . Somewhere near the slide projector her voice comes out of the darkness to explain the pictures in the calm , dispassionate tones of a person who has told a story many times . The slides are made from black and white photographs , and some are poorly focused . The effect is chilling , like watching a CostaGavras docudrama with the sound turned down . The $20,000 the doctors pledge at the end of the meeting will ostensibly go to help the families of those under arrest , and to lobbying efforts for more human rights in Taiwan . This is Linda Shih 's life now , traveling incessantly between Washington , D.C. , New York , Chicago , Minnesota , California ? anywhere there is a community of Taiwanese or a willing journalist , legislator , or staff aide to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shih Ming-teh 's smiling face in that prison cemetery . Photographs are the only way she can see him now . She was deported from Taiwan shortly after the Kaohsiung incident , and Shih Ming-teh has become a memory , a cause , and , she is convinced , a legend in his time . Deportation from Taiwan was like being thrown out of her second native country : She spent 7 of her 31 years there . At 12 , she began studying Chinese in San Francisco . At 14 , she moved to Taiwan with her father , a major in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps . By 1968 , when she was 19 , she returned to the United States , marvelously fluent in Mandarin Chinese , not an easy language to master . After earning degrees in anthropology and Chinese studies from Stanford and the University of California , she returned to Taiwan in 1977 with grants to study the lives of women factory workers . She left behind a husband , a son , and a marriage of 11 years . Once there , the incongruities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perpetually under martial law quickly drew her to those who counted themselves // // - among the opposition . TO BE IN THE opposition in Taiwan means to be In opposition to the Kuomintang , the Nationalist Chinese party of Chiang Kai-shek . Taiwan has been in an official state of siege since the defeated Nationalists arrived in 1949 . There are still on the books selectively applied sedition laws that prescribe the death sentence for , among other things , encouraging a labor strike , public incitement of others to commit a crime , and even circulation of rumors , according . to a human rights report by the Asian Center in New York . A case can be made for a slow but growing lbaralization since Chiang Kai-shek 's death in 1975 . More native Taiwanese now have government positions and elected posts . And several Taiwan watchers say political liberalization , including a greater tolerance of freedom of speech and assembly , has been at a peak in the last year since President Carter 's announcement of normalization with mainland China . BUT MUCH OF that seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only were dozens of opposition figures arrested , but'three political magazines were shut down and banned , including the one that had come to be the most influential , the one which Shih hling-teh had become general manager of , Formosa magazine . If one were to draw up a truncated resume for Shih Ming-teh , it would read something like this : Name : Shih Ming-teh Birthplace : Kaohsiung , Taiwan 111 : : Age : 39 1 , , Education : B.A. , China Army Academy Experience : Political prisoner ( 190-1977 ) ; general manager , Formosa magazine ( 1979 ) . avoid arrest . Early ea the morning of Dec. /3 , knowing it was just a matter of time , Linda Shlh kissed and embraced her painfully thin husband- " I wanted to discuss our personal relationship . I wanted something to remember . I held bins for a while that morning . He was bike a block of ice . " But when the hard , assertive knocking began on the door that morning , Slab Ming-teh did not hesitate . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever a railing sad away into the streets of Taipei . It was the last time she SSW NM Two days later She was deported . ' AN ISLANDWIDE manhunt was began . with sews &; al large rewards as incentive . Pictures of his distinc the face were widely circulated , an Shrls King-tea decided the only way to survive would be to change his face . A sympathetic surgeon filled out his cheeks and his bowed jawbone , and probably shaped his eyebrows and Lifted the corners of his eyes as well . But It did n't help . He was captured a few weeks later in an apartment over a noodle shop in downtown Taipei . A Lutheran minister , apparently not by choice , led police to the apartment and gave the prearranged knock that opened the door . The picture taken by Taipei newspaper photographers at the time of Shill Ming-teh 's capture shows bias still wearing bandages , looking calm and unruffled , a wry , almost beatific smile oil his face , and no more questions darning in his eyes .

At 22 , soon after graduating from military college , he was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges he proposed an independent Taiwan , and that the People 's Republic of China take the UN China seat and the Republic of China give up its claim to the mainland ? all unforgivable sins when Chiang Kai-shek was alive . But two years after Chiang died and his son , Chiang Ching-kuo , had settled into his job , a general ' amnesty was declared and Shih Ming-teh was re ? leased . . ' FIFTEEN YEARS of poor nutrition and little exer ? ' else had left him emaciated and weak . Whether from malnutrition or . beatings , Shih Ming-teh did n't have a tooth left that he could call his own . The degeneration of his lower jawbone from losing so many teeth resulted in the upward arch that gives him his distinct bow-jawed appearance . Prison beatings ' lso lett him with a painful permanent spinal injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . Shih Ming-teh was a handsome man who did not lack for female attention . " He was a thoroughly charming and delightful peson with a devil-may-care bravado , " recalls Rebecca . Cantwell , a Colorado journalist who toured in 1978 . Those qualities were not lost on Linda Arrigo Shih . But it was his fierce politcal commitment that really drew them together , she said . " Before we started living . together , I sought him out . He never thought be had property to give him the position to seek a wife . My proposal was that we have a child together . I wanted another child and I had an idea that having a child would give us the same protection that marriage would . " BUT A CHILD was never to lie . so they were married in mid-1978 . " We were not in love the way people are usually in love . My feelings toward him ' were a great sense of merging in a common goal . And I think I loved him very intensely . " But living with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong . He suffered much . In some ways , he can not be a normal person . I am committed to him as an individual and as a leader , and as an embodiment of total commitment to his Ideals . But my personal relationship was often . unhappy , because he could never commit himself to anything except his ideals . And we always foresaw that someday he would be jailed . " In many senses it was a political marriage of convenience . a way for her to remain in the country  --  and for him to leave , if necessary . It was ideologically fruitful as well . Linda Arrigo . Shih 's Stanford , bred international perspective complemented Shill Ming-telfs more narrowly focused Taiwanese perspective and his charisma and organizing abilities . - " We made a good team , " Linda Sixth said .

They were a new wave encouraged by normalization and the spirit of " new . realism " that seemed to characterize the Kuomintang 's relatively lenient attitude toward opposition politicians during much of 1979 . Like other political magazines , Formosa magazine was a surrogate political party ? martial law forbids real opposition political parties . It grew quickly after only a few issues , with 15 branch offices around the island and a print run of 100.000 by Dacember . " People were looking for something different . It had funny , ' cynical cartoons , irreverent and controversial articles , sort of like Ramparts back in the ' 60s , " a State Department Asian specialist said . - THEY ORGANIZED rallies around the island . focusing an human rights . Each time , like adolescents testing adult authority , they probed the limits of martial law and the goverrunent 's tentative new liberal attitude . Someone did n't like it .

When Shih Ming-teh and the staff of Formosa magazine set about organizing their International Human Rights Day rally . negotiations with Kaohsiung authorities for a permit see-sawed . The organizers wanted the event held outdoors because they expected tens of thousands of people from all over the island , but the authorities wanted it held indoors . The permit was never approved . After much internal debate , the organizers , with Shih Minmteh and Linda Amigo Shih on the " yea " side , decided to go ahead with the demonstration . The rest is told in the Costa-Gavraslike slides Linda - Sigh carries with her in her travels around the country . Riot - troops ... tear gas ... an angry , aggressive crowd .
