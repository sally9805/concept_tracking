 | The shirt collar was open , the tie askew . The eyelids drooped after days and nights of strike negotiations with little sleep . Even the steely aristocratic bearing slipped away as he joked loosely with members of his staff . " I 'm drained , " Peter Ueberroth admitted on the day after baseball 's strike settlement . The words were understandable and touching from the man who seemed smaller and more human than the figure being lionized by the press . In just over a year , Ueberroth had seemed to bring sanity to both the Summer Games of the Olympics and the summer game of baseball . IT 'S PETER THE GREAT , proclaimed a headline above a column by Dick Young of the New York Post , a frequent critic of the baseball commissioner . The word hero cropped up in headlines across the land . Ueberroth had not only preserved the pennant races for the fans . He had stared down the people who pay him ? and shifted the troubled course of what is , perhaps , America 's most basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted , off guard . For about five minutes . He retired to an anteroom and then reappeared , blue eyes bright and tie straight . He strode to lunch a few blocks from his Park Avenue office with his jacket over his arm , southern California style , while accepting the congratulations of fans on the New York streets . His manner was vintage Ueberroth , as seen from the Los Angeles Olympics to the bargaining tables of New York : a mix ofbarely believable public modesty and gaudy accomplishment , cold dignity and occasional warmth . He is a man who likes to work in his shirt sleeves but hardly ever rolls them up and gets dirty . The facts of the quick settlement of last week 's strike can be simply stated . The owners , many of whom have spent their way into financial difficulties , wanted the players to give up rights they had won over the years in courts and collective bargaining . The players sought to preserve various rights in free-agency and salary arbitration , as well as the share of television revenues allocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they wanted . The owners got almost nothing . Sportswriters have a dangerous tendency to score subtle labor battles like prizefights , but in this case let 's take the risk . The players won a decision . Ueberroth scored a knockout . As lawyers hammered out the final details of the agreement last week , there were many theories about what leverage Ueberroth had used on the 26 moguls who employ him . They ranged from an attempt to invoke a commissioner 's right to act in the " best interests of baseball " to a threat of resignation . " That would have been a ridiculous piece of leverage , " said Ueberroth . " There were times when my resignation probably would have been applauded by both sides . " Frivolous ' : The commissioner scoffed at the notion that he was a noble corporate spirit , a chief executive officer who told his board of directors that he was mad as hell and was n't going to take it anymore . " There 's no comparison , " he said . " I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I work for a group of competitors , people who are trying to outbid one another and win . My job is to make sense out of the whole situation . " Making sense , however , does n't always mean speaking like a diplomat : two weeks ago Ueberroth called the own-  | ers ' proposal " frivolous . " At the same session , Ueberroth declared himself the voice of the fans . His rhetoric was virtuoso , but since every sports labor problem evokes bleats from self-proclaimed fan representatives , it struck some as a grandstand play . Lee MacPhail and Don Fehr , the respective leaders of the management and union negotiating teams , expressed skepticism . Marvin Miller , the A fan 's come shrewd former union boss and current union adviser , said wryly , " All the public-relations ingredients are there . But exactly which fans elected him ? " It did n't matter . The principals underestimated the personal force behind Ueberroth 's public statements . Olympic observers remember well how he tempered his words about sports and America with an iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jittery Staffers : Some of the tales of Ueberroth in L.A. will probably outlive the Games ' unprecedented $223 million profit . He lured some corporate sponsors into bidding wars to get in on the flag-waving spending spree , but when Eastman Kodak balked at the $4 million minimum fee needed to become the official film , patriotism gave way to a deal with Fuji of Japan . Stuffy Olympic establishment members had spent 16 years vilifying Tommie Smith and John Carlos , the black-power protesters of the Mexico City Games ; Ueberroth hired Carlos to do community relations . And the rich and powerful were not the only targets of his single-minded leadership style . Jittery staffers who barely knew him were reportedly stopped in the halls and subjected to grillings on Olympic trivia to test their dedication to his grand project . One small incident in Los Angeles may have been as telling as any . Chris Riley , wife of Laker coach Pat and a typically smart , levelheaded type whom Ueberroth had placed in charge of the basketball venue , was entertaining several foreign sports-federation presidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then they added one strong objection : Ueberroth and his staff had done most of the planning without consulting them . That , of course , was a big reason why the Olympics worked . Tradition and protocol always finished far behind pragmatism . Baseball owners were quick to learn how those federation heads felt . The day after Ueberroth began his duties as commissioner last fall , the umpires threatened to strike the playoffs . Ueberroth quickly stepped in to mediate the controversy . Then he ruled in favor of the union . This year he sought to enhance his public image by announcing a war on drugs . Under his plan , all baseball personnel ? except the players and umpires , whose unions would have to agree ? were required to undergo random testing . The idea of septuagenarian multimillionaire owners urinating into jars to prove they have resisted free-basing may be ludicrous , and civil libertarians may quibble about the constitutionality of such a program . But in an era plagued by drugs , it appeared to be a popular and easy , if somewhat ineffectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If it was so easy to do , where 's the rush of other sports leaders to join me ? " he asked . " We will protect people 's privacy and offer help instead of penalties , so I do n't believe we have any civil-rights problems . I refer you to Jesse Jackson , who has embraced my position and is being helpful . I 'm willing to stand on the principle that society is facing a major problem , and baseball can lead toward a solution . Enough is enough . " The commissioner showed similar impatience in recent weeks . First he issued a promise to become an " activist " in the strike negotiations and take " appropriate action . " Then he announced a series of proposals , most of which seemed to call for the owners to back down on key issues like a salary cap . One of his less-realistic suggestions illustrated his flair for the dramatic : as both sides haggled over a disputed $45 million in pension funds , $1 million a day would be withdrawn from the kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hardened negotiators smirked , public-relations buffs wondered why he had stopped short of sending it to Ethiopia , thus creating baseball 's first Live Aid press conference . A few critics insist that with that maneuver , he not only stunned some owners but also strengthened the players ' resolve to strike and seek total victory . The more widely held thought is that he was giving the owners fair public warning of the private pressure that he was about to apply . Ueberroth 's eyes glazed every time he was asked about whatever specific requests he made . But there was little doubt that by the time the strike occurred , he had spent hours on the phone exhorting the owners to reach a settlement . As lawyer Edward Bennett Williams , owner of the Baltimore Orioles , put it , " He hung over the last round of negotiations like the ghost of Banquo . " In the end , the owners gave up on the salary cap . They yielded their demand that players who go to arbitration be limited to 100 percent pay increases , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mets will soon be millionaires . And they abolished the draft that allowed teams to be compensated with major leaguers when they lost players to free agency . The pension money was allocated in a compromise , and the union conceded that starting in 1987 a player would need three years ' service instead of two before being allowed to go to arbitration . " My role , " deadpanned Ueberroth , " was no role . " Assertiveness : The next day , when the Live Aid analogy seemed complete and the commissioner was spread across most of the media like a rock star , he was asked if the owners had been surprised by his assertiveness . He smiled and nodded a weary yes . " Then they did n't do much homework on your back-ground ? " " Either that , or they did n't listen to what I said when they hired me . " Everyone seems to be listening now , and many want to hear about a Senate race in California , a mythical presidential ticket with Lee Iacocca ? take your pick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond baseball . Ueberroth firmly denies such ambitions , emphasizing that he would be uncomfortable campaigning . He sounds persuasive to those who know him well . To campaign is to relinquish some control , to plead instead of order , to seek instead of solve . I do not think Peter Ueberroth wants to be Ronald Reagan . Henry Kissinger sounds about right . @#
