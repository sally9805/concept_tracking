In his pre-presidential incarnation , George Bush was the Democrats ' juiciest target : the perennial preppy , the suspect wimp , the Vice President who was always off at a ball game or a funeral when weighty affairs of state were being decided . But after eight months in the Oval Office , Bush tops even Ronald Reagan in popularity ( 70% approval ) , a reversal of fortune that has plunged the out party into another of its periodic identity crises . Last week , in an orgy of finger pointing , party stalwarts from New York Governor Mario Cuomo to national chairman Ron Brown asked , in effect , Where are the Democrats ? <P> Although the party retained two House seats in special elections in Texas and California last week , the Democrats have no clearly enunciated national agenda and , perhaps worse , no one to enunciate it . To a notable lack of enthusiasm , Brown nominated himself for the role . More logical choices are House Speaker Tom Foley and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , since the Democrat-controlled Congress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But both leaders are cautious and , to their critics , the kind of nice guys who do n't win pennants . Last week showed why : <P> CAPITAL GAINS <P> Foley and the once powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , Illinois ' Dan Rostenkowski , suffered a stinging setback when six committee Democrats joined all 13 Republicans to help Bush redeem a campaign pledge to reduce this tax . Although Democrats denounced the idea in last year 's presidential campaign as a giveaway to the rich ( 60% of its benefits will go to people with incomes of more than $200,000 ) , the measure is expected to pass in the House . Mitchell vows to try to derail it in the Senate , but he is without the support of Texas ' Lloyd Bentsen , who as chairman of the Finance Committee could be his most powerful ally . <P> Bentsen won acclaim for an alternative proposal : encourage savings by expanding the deduction for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts . This would provide tax benefits mostly to the middle class while simultaneously creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital- gains reduction . Before IRA deductions were restricted in 1986 , however , they cost the Treasury $16 billion a year in lost taxes . Bentsen 's proposal is unlikely to stop the stampede to cut capital gains , and it could become the next giveaway that Congress and the President will seize upon . But the prospect of a huge loss in revenue at a time of record deficits will probably prove unacceptable . <P> The capital-gains tax cut ( from 33% to 19.6% for 2 1/2 years ) illustrates the " babble of voices " that plagues Democratic efforts to unite on an issue . Critics say Foley and Rostenkowski threw in the towel too early ; Mitchell girded his loins too late ; and Bentsen , who delivered the party 's response to Bush 's economic message last winter , favors a lower rate . <P> CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS <P> Democrats and Republicans alike are in full retreat from ired elders who awakened belatedly to the fact that they are going to have to pay hefty premiums if catastrophic-illness coverage remains a part of Medicare . Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some benefits , such as payment for prescription drugs , to lower premiums that could amount to $1,600 a year for a couple . <P> DRUGS
