Name : Bill Hutton , 40 Occupation : Outdoor sign painter Background : Hutton began painting in 1969 , shortly after returning from the Army . He worked for his father as a house painter , but when business slowed down later the same year , his father urged him to try sign painting . About a year and a half ago Hutton went into business for himself and now has 10 painters working for him . Hutton and his wife have four children and live in Lansing . Years in present position : 19 Alot of people want to be sign painters , and they try it , but they just can ' t cut it . We work quite high-50 or 60 feet is normal . And some jobs are 135 feet off the ground . When you get up that high , it ' s a little unnerving if you ' re not used to it . If you can overcome the fear of heights , you still have to produce while you ' re up there . You have to be able to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s rare to be able to find a good outside journeyman . They ' re few and far between . Heights never really bothered me . The people I used to work for would give me nearly every high , nasty job they got-water towers , tall buildings and such-because I never would turn them down . Most of my training was on the job . There is an apprentice school that the union sponsors . They teach the rudimentary skills of lettering and layout . But for the actual outdoor stuff , you have to be outdoors to do it . They can stand you in a hallway at school and tell you to paint someting , but once you get 60 or 80 feet in the air and the wind is blowing on you and you ' re rocking around , it ' s very different . Every sign starts out as a scaled-down version of the artwork . We use an overhead projector to blow this picture up onto a wall . Then we put brown butcher paper up on the wall , and we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines of whatever is on the scale drawing . The next step is to take the paper out to the billboard and position it properly on the board . Then we beat on the paper with a bag of charcoal dust . This leaves marks on the board along the outlines of the drawing , and we can then remove the paper . Although the marks are there , you still need some artistic ability to blend the colors . You get the marks where the eyes and nose are , but you still have to put the colors on right to make it look like eyes and nose . It ' s a skill . It ' s not something everyone can do . What I like most about this job is that although it ' s always the same type of work , every day there ' s something different . Either the copy is different or the location is different . That keeps it interesting . When Reagan was here before the last election , we made some huge banners for the rally at the Rosemont Horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough , and we had to do the lettering . They had us working at the annex to the Horizon for about 24 hours straight to complete the work on time . The worst part about it was not the hours we worked but that the circus had just been there . There was such a smell , it was unbelievable . It was clean , but the smell lingered . The Secret Service was checking on everything we were doing , down to the size of the signs , because they had to be sure that nothing would block their view . It was really interesting . We do work all year round . We can ' t work in rain , though . And high wind stops us because most of the boards just sit on top of a steel tube like a lollipop , and they ' re built to rock . If they were too rigid , they would snap . And when you start rocking like that , you just physically can ' t be up there . When it gets down to 10 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do work with gloves , but it gets awkward . Your fingers freeze up on you , and you have to put them inside your coveralls every once in a while and go down into the truck and warm up occasionally . It ' s tough in the winter , but it ' s great in the summer . You can work in shorts and no shirt . It never gets too hot for me , though I meet a lot of painters from Southern states who have come up here because they couldn ' t take the heat down there . On a typical day we start out around 7 : 30 , unless we ' re going very far , like up to Wisconsin . Then we have to allow another hour and a half for driving there and back . When you get to the location , you virtually unload your entire truck . All the equipment and everything you carry in your truck has to go up on the sign . While one fellow is unloading everything , the other fellow will be mixing paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field , and you have to drag everything in because you can ' t take your truck in . So that takes even longer , maybe an extra hour . We pull all the equipment up on the board , and you have to rig it-put it all in place and put it all together . Once that ' s finished , we eradicate the old copy , if there is any , with a blackout coat ; then we put up the paper patterns , which have already been done in the shop . The type of paint we use is made especially for sign painting . It dries very fast-in about an hour . And the colors are much more vibrant than house paint . Our paint doesn ' t last as long as house paint , as a rule , but it doesn ' t have to , since the signs get changed every six months to a year . All the colors have to dry rapidly so you can go on to the next step . Generally , a day is spent doing one sign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go home . If the sign is just lettering , we can do a 14- by-48-foot sign in one day . The 20-by-60-foot signs usually take two days , unless the copy is very easy . Where there are pictures involved , it depends on the degree of difficulty in the picture . We just completed a 20-by-60 for WLUP radio , and it has a full-size picture of Phil Collins , and his head even goes 6 feet above the top of the sign . Now that took nearly a week . They actually filmed us doing this for their commercial . A crew is usually two guys : a journeyman and his helper or apprentice . You have to both be up there together . It takes two guys . And if someone gets hurt , you ' d need the other fellow to at least go for help . This happened on a job that I was working on once . A guy fell off the sign and broke his back in three places . He fell 60 feet . He lived , but in another accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the sign , and he was electrocuted . So there are hazards . Danger is not something you think about except when you ' re new at this . Being careful just becomes second nature . I change our ropes if there is even a hint that they ' re getting bad . You become so aware of the danger subconsciously . If anything doesn ' t feel right under your feet , you ' re startled instantly . You stay on your toes all the time . They sent us down to Memphis one time to paint a grain elevator . We were told it was going to be 100 feet off the ground , and when we got down there we found out it was 200 feet . The equipment we had was too short to reach the bottom of the sign , which only came halfway down the building . We had to tie on extra ropes . When we pulled up on the job , one of the people standing there said , " Are you going to paint that sign ? " We said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here fell off , and both of ' em got killed . " But we did it , and we didn ' t fall off . We paint lots of benches and billboards with personal messages . We did one for a guy whose wife left him . He wanted it to look like he had climbed up there and painted it himself . So we did it like a kid would draw it , with a big , bleeding heart . We also did one out at the airport for a man who wanted a big " Welcome Home " sign for his wife . We ' ve done several " Will you marry me ? " signs , too . We paint signs for the Illinois State Lottery . We change 22 boards every week for the different million-dollar amounts . Depending on how much people play , sometimes we have to change it more often . If it ' s going up by leaps and bounds , we ' ll have to go out during the week and change it . We did it twice in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Sure , a point comes when you ' re too old to do this work . But it depends on your own physical condition . I guess when you get up to your mid- or late 50s , you want to start getting off the street . But I ' ll keep on as long as I can because it keeps me in pretty good shape . Climbing up those ladders all the time will keep a guy from wearing out . CAPTION : PHOTO : Bill Hutton immortalizes Bruce Springsteen on the side of a building in the River North area .
