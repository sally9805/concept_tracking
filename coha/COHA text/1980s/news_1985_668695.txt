It will be interesting to see if this week ' s guest host on " Saturday Night Live , " at 10 : 30 on NBC-Ch. 5 , will be asked to assume  --  as the designated visitor , Madonna , did last week  --  the major load of the acting assignments . Undoubtedly , he will . He is , after all , Chevy Chase  --  and Joan Cusack , Randy Quaid , Robert Downey , Dennis Miller , Danitra Vance , Jon Lovitz , Anthony Michael Hall , Nora Dunn and Terry Sweeney are not . Producer Lorne Michaels , the program ' s creator and original executive producer who has returned to the show after a self-imposed five-year interlude , apparently didn ' t trust the all-brand-new starting lineup for the 11th-season opener . Instead , he shoved them into the background in favor of showcasing hot-ticket Madonna ( " I ' ll be your comedy love slave for the evening " ) , who was called upon to play a Hollywood prima donna , a Latin American bombshell , an outspoken Princess Di and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time ever that a Marilyn Monroe impersonation featured a Puerto Rican accent . Where in the world but Amer-i-ca ? A few weeks back , a New York Times Magazine story on a French family stated that the children were forbidden to watch " Dallas " and " Dynasty " and that the adults themselves derided such programs with the explanation , " C ' est pour les ploucs "  --  " It ' s for the simple-minded . " It is hoped for the sake of U.S.-Gallic relations that members of that particular family did not even hear about the debut of " Saturday Night Live , " which was pocked with flat gags and flubbed lines . One would think that 17 hand-picked writers could come up with more original ideas than yet another parody of " The Twilight Zone . " In a recent interview , Michaels said that the program would be returning to the emphasis on political humor that marked the ' 70s shows . The political humor , it turned out , consisted of amateurish Kennedy brother impressions ( only Randy Quaid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JFK smothers Monroe with a pillow ) that was meant to be calculatingly tasteless but proved to be only transparently tedious . None of the newcomers managed to stand out from the pack , although Quaid  --  the oldest , at 35 , as well as most professionally experienced ( " The Last Detail " and " National Lampoon ' s Vacation " on the screen , " True West " on the stage ) did reasonably well  --  despite the material  --  in roles ranging from Ronald Reagan to Joaquin Andujar . As for some of the others , the callow Anthony Michael Hall  --  who was 7 years old when the first " SNL " aired in 1975 and already has shown his talent in movies like " 16 Candles " and " The Breakfast Club "  --  was reduced to playing a junkie who sells stolen electronic merchandise . This came after he had presented a urine specimen to Brandon Tartikoff , president of NBC Entertainment , who had announced a new network policy : random drug-testing for the cast members of all NBC programs , including " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the " News Update " segment , anchorperson Dennis Miller tried hard to bring a Bill Murray-knucklehead quality in announcing such bits as Louis Farrakhan ' s dressing like Pee Wee Herman and TWA instituting a " frequent- hostage program , " but Miller ' s effort almost made one wish for the return of Charles Rocket . Terry Sweeney  --  who looks like the reincarnation of the Dick Tracy villain , Flattop  --  drew the assignments of a gay movie star trying , in the midst of the AIDS scare , to pass for macho , and as a boozy Nancy Reagan . And Danitra Vance , the sole black regular , did an Eddie-Murphy-like bit as a 10th grader , mother of two and author of the " I Don ' t Want a Baby Coloring Book . " It was that kind of humor , that kind of show . Even now , even the most sporadic " Saturday Night Live " viewers may have fond memories of John Belushi , Gilda Radner , Jane Curtin , Dan Aykroyd , Laraine Newman and Murray , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very well be a surge of instant nostalgia for Billy Crystal and Martin Short . As for the present cast members  --  at least in their initial outing  --  they looked simply awful . It ' s so funny they ' d think we wouldn ' t know that.  --  In brief : " Hill Street Blues " continues to be  --  arguably , as they say  --  the best series on the air , but it is apparent that it is suffering from erosion . Belker ' s growls and epithets ( " camel breath " was one of the latest ) are becoming tiresome , the Furillo-Davenport relationship has settled into lethargy and newcomer ( and fine Chicago actor ) Dennis Frantz has been handed a part ( the sleazy Lt. Buntz with his sleazy Big Lunch ties ) that already has become as much of a caricature as that of the SWAT-smart Howard Hunter , who so far this season has been duped by both a transvestite and a bunko artist .
