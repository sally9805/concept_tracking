Butler National Golf Club seems to have cornered the market on " 50-year floods , " but Western Golf Association officials are confident that next week ' s Western Open will be played on schedule . " There is a lot of water out there , but I still think we ' ll play here Thursday through Sunday , " said Western Open tournament director Peter de Young . The Oak Brook club , which was hit by big floods in 1982 and 1983 , received 8. 3 inches of rain late Thursday and early Friday and had eight of its 18 holes under water by Friday afternoon . Salt Creek , which winds through the course , carries flood waters from communities north of Oak Brook and is expected to crest at Butler Saturday . One third of the course ' s 150 acres is under water , including the famed 18th hole . " I ' ve seen water on half of 18 and on the front of No. 1 , but I ' ve never seen them under water , " said Butler National superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles to get the 84th Western off on schedule . He had to combat floods and a power outage in the 1983 Western . That tournament finished with 36 holes on Monday . The latest storm put more water on Butler than in 1983 , but pumps remained in working order . The weather for the rest of the weekend is a question mark that only time will answer . Miles is prepared to do everything he can to get the tournament started on schedule . " Mr. ( John ) Gleason , our club president , and Mr. Jack Shea ( Butler grounds and greens chairman ) gave me permission to do whatever I have to do with equipment and manpower to make sure we have a 1987 Western Open , " said Miles , who has been at Butler for seven years . " That ' s our goal . Tomorrow we ' ll look at the course and be ready to work on the two-thirds of the course that isn ' t flooded , and as soon as the water recedes , we ' ll start working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open week is scheduled to begin at noon Monday with a pro-am at Butler . A junior clinic is scheduled for Tuesday , and the Chick Evans Memorial Pro-Am is set for Wednesday . The pro-am is in jeopardy even without any additional rain . WGA officials are investigating the possibility of moving the Monday event , with cancellation being a last resort . Tournament officials said they could wait as late as next Saturday to start the main event and still play 72 holes . In 1983 , second-round play was delayed on Friday and completed on Saturday before the third and fourth rounds were washed out . Under the worst scenario , there would not be an 84th Western Open . WGA would not be able to move the tournament to another week because the PGA Tour schedule is filled during the time a tour event can be played in Chicago . Moving the tournament to another Chicago site next week is out of the question because of the logistics involved , including television cables for ABC . " The WGA is going to pretty well react to Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been with Oscar now for a long time , and we ' ve seen what he can do . We had a miracle in ' 83 . We ' re not on an hour-to-hour basis with any postponement , cancellation or anything . We ' re going to be on a day-to-day basis from now on . " Two things the Western has going for it are Miles , who will be getting help from area golf-course superintendents and their crews , and the fact that the storm didn ' t happen next Friday .
