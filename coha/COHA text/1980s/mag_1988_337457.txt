Let 's say there is an office pool on that ultimate test of valor and gristle , the Olympic men 's downhill ski race at Mount Allan , near Calgary . You throw in your dollar , reach into the hat , and pull out the name of Switzerland 's Peter Muller , say , or Canada 's Rob Boyd . Congratulations ! These are hairy-eared mountain men , eaters of nails , sleepers on plank floors , and you are looking fairly good to win a hatful of dollars . Muller , at 30 still the toughest downhill specialist since Austria 's Franz Klammer , won the pre-Olympic downhill trial at Mount Allan last season . In downhill he was World Cup champion in ' 79 and ' 80 , second at the Sarajevo Olympics four years ago and gold medalist at Crans-Montana in Switzerland last year in the biennial world championships . Boyd , 21 , is a young phenom on a tear , leading an inspired team that will be playing to the home folks . In mid-December he won the ferocious downhill at Val @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row . Grrrr ! Another helping of your 20-penny galvanized , waiter , with a quart of jalapeno sauce . <P> Right . But do n't count your money just yet . Big , cheerful Michael Mair of Italy , who won at Leukerbad last month , could get his bear-shaped 220 lbs . behind a thundering run . A slightly smaller Swiss bear , burly Daniel Mahrer , has won two downhills so far this season . No U.S. skier will place in the downhill without supernatural intervention , but any one of several Austrians could reverse that team 's unaccountable recent blahs and win out of sheer embarrassment . And then , of course , there is Pirmin Zurbriggen , 25 , the people 's choice from Zurich to Zug , from Zell to Saas-Almagell , his tiny hometown in the Swiss canton of Valais . <P> Last year , for the second time , Zurbriggen won skiing 's overall World Cup , the measure of season-long excellence in the Alpine disciplines ( slalom ; giant slalom ; super-G , for super giant slalom ; and downhill ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals and two silvers . He leads the current World Cup , and this Olympic year could establish him as the best all-event male Alpine skier since Jean-Claude Killy . Not the best male Alpine skier , without qualification , over this period ; that would be Sweden 's astonishing Ingemar Stenmark , still campaigning at 31 , a self-invented slalom and giant slalom wizard who has won more World Cup races ( 85 ) than any other man . But Stenmark does not like downhills , and he wo n't run these down-in- flames plunges . He won golds in slalom and giant slalom at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980 , then was banned from Sarajevo because he did not meet the tortured Olympic definition of eligibility . He 'll be on hand at Calgary , still rich from fees and endorsements but once more eligible . Stenmark is the archetype of an age of skiing specialists , and Zurbriggen is the best of the handful of world-class racers versatile enough to beat the specialists in any event .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
