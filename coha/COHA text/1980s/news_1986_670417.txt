The Court also held that death row prisoners must be given a fair opportunity to establish their insanity , including an impartial officer or board to consider psychiatric presentations and legal arguments made on their behalf. // The Court blocked Florida at least temporarily from executing a man convicted of murder who his attorney says became insane while on death row . The state found him sane enough to be executed , but the Court said Florida ' s procedures in making that finding had been inadequate. // // Some Tests Are Cursory // The decision also appeared to invalidate procedures in some other states for evaluating such assertions by death row prisoners . No state permits execution of the insane , but states use a variety of procedures , often rather cursory , for testing insanity. // About a dozen of the more than 1 , 700 inmates on death rows around the nation have had insanity assertions made on their behalf , opponents of the death penalty say . Justice William H. Rehnquist said in dissent that the decision today would create incentives for more. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries no jurisdiction has countenanced the execution of the insane , yet this Court has never decided whether the Constitution forbids the practice , " he said . " Today we keep faith with our common-law heritage in holding that it does . " Justices Harry A. Blackmun , John Paul Stevens and William J. Brennan Jr. joined his opinion . <> <> Powell ' s View Is Crucial // Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. joined the portion of Justice Marshall ' s opinion holding that the Eighth Amendment ' s ban on " cruel and unusual punishments " prohibits " inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insane. " // But he said he would not go as far in requiring procedural protections as Justice Marshall , so Justice Powell ' s opinion apparently represents the holding of the Court on the definition of insanity for purposes of execution and on the procedures required. // Justice Powell said the Constitution barred execution only of those so insane as to be " unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alvin B. Ford , " is cured of his disease , the state is free to execute him . " This means that death row inmates who become insane must stay insane to stay alive . The decision today sent Mr. Ford ' s case back to Federal District Court in Florida to determine if he is sane enough to be executed. // Justice Powell ' s opinion would go further in protecting Mr. Ford than would Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices William H. Rehnquist , Sandra Day O ' Connor and Byron R. White , who said the Constitution does not bar execution of the insane. // Justices O ' Connor and White sided with Mr. Ford , but not on the central constitutional issue . They said instead that Florida ' s procedures violated due process of the law because they did not provide even " minimal procedural protections " for Mr. Ford ' s right under Florida law not to be executed while insane . <> <> Rehnquist Dissents // Justice Rehnquist filed a dissent , which was joined by Chief Justice Burger. // Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial determination of sanity " offered " an invitation to those who have nothing to lose by accepting it to advance entirely spurious claims of insanity. " // " A prisoner found sane two days before execution might claim to have lost his sanity the next day , thus necessitating another judicial determination of his sanity and presumably another stay of his execution , " he added. // The issue in the case , Ford v. Wainwright , No. 85-5542 , was unrelated to the defense raised by some prisoners at their trials that they are not responsible for their crimes because they were insane at the time they committed them. // Mr. Ford did not say he had been insane in 1974 when he killed a Fort Lauderdale police officer while robbing a restaurant . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to die that year . His lawyer , Richard Burr , and his psychiatrist argued that he had gradually gone mad in 1982 and 1983 while on death row at the Florida State Prison in Starke . <> <> Series of Delusions // They said he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope John Paul III . " They also said he sometimes lapsed into complete incomprehensibility. // When Mr. Ford ' s lawyer asserted he could not be executed because he was insane , Gov . Bob Graham appointed a panel of three psychiatrists , who interviewed Mr. Ford for about 30 minutes . While two of the doctors diagnosed him as psychotic , all three agreed that he understood why he was to die , as required by state law. // The Governor , while refusing to consider the reports of two other pyschiatrists submitted by Mr. Ford ' s lawyer , signed Mr. Ford ' s death warrant April 30 , 1984 , without explanation. // Justice Marshall noted today that for centuries the common law had condemned execution of the insane as " savage and inhuman " and that " no state in the Union permits the execution of the insane. " // " Today , no less than before , " he said , " we may seriously question the retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall also cited " the natural abhorrence civilized societies feel at killing one who has no capacity to come to grips with his own conscience or Deity " and the need " to protect the dignity of society itself from the barbarity of exacting mindless vengeance. " // Justices Marshall and Powell both said Florida ' s procedures violated due process because they did not guarantee Mr. Ford ' s lawyer an opportunity to submit evidence or arguments on his behalf and placed the decision " wholly within the executive branch , " under a Governor who was also " the commander of the state ' s corps of prosecutors.
