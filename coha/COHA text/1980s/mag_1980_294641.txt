Do-it-yourselfers are beating high costs at home <P> Most home handymen used to be harmless basement tinkerers who whiled away their leisure hours building knotty-pine bookshelves . No longer . With a vigor born of economic necessity , more and more Americans are pushing themselves away from the TV set and doing their own home improvements . Risking blackened thumbnails and sawdust-filled eyes , they are installing bathrooms , insulating attics and renovating whole houses . Do-it-yourselfers this year are expected to spend nearly $28 billion , about three times as much as just seven years ago . <P> The major reason most people pick up a hammer is the high cost of home repairs . Carpenters in Chicago , for example , charge as much as $14 an hour , if they are available .

He admits to having a tough time even hanging curtains , but says , " I 'm finding a need to acquire those skills . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , more people are staying home and stretching the family budget by doing their own work . Fixing up the old family homestead that has a 6% mortgage is far cheaper than buying a new house .

Professional tools like a ramset , a heavy-duty stud gun that uses .22-cal. cartridges to drive nails into concrete , are enjoying wider use . Energy-conserving improvements , such as the installation of wood-burning stoves and clock-activated thermostats , are among the most popular weekend projects . <P> Sprawling super hardware stores and home-improvement centers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-centers division has grown to 240 outlets since it was started four years ago . Toolmakers are prospering . Black &; Decker 's U.S. profits rose 29% in 1979 . <P> Along with the demand for hardware and tools come growing requests for instructions . Says Michael J. Montalbano , president of Houston 's Retail Lumber &; Building Material Dealers Association : " People do n't know anything about what they 're doing . " A common novice mistake is to use a piece of string as a measuring tape . Once at the lumberyard , the string starts to stretch and the would-be woodworker either goes back home or ends up with a board that is too long . Thus the black thumb rule at most home-repair centers : $5 worth of advice with every $1 in sales . Last winter Boston 's public television station WGBH broadcast a 13-week series on home renovation titled This Old House . The program drew some of the highest ratings in the station 's history , and a new version will be put on nationwide this fall .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
