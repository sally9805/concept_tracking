Legislation has been introduced in Congress calling for regulations that could signal the end for some small handgun makers , said Harry Hampton , executive director of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute , a trade group . " If that were their sole line , it would pretty much close them up , " he said. // Others are not so pessimistic and expect the industry to ride out the storm , with handgun sales increasing again this year . <> <> Ill-Defined Weapons // Much of the challenge centers on the debate over " Saturday night specials , " the ill-defined weapons that most people associate with street crime and , most recently , with the attempt on President Reagan ' s life. // " What the people who make the Saturday night specials do , " sighed an official of one large New England gun manufacturer recently , weary of answering a flood of press inquiries about gun control , " is give the industry a black eye. " // According to some estimates , Saturday night specials may account for as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States every year . But it is nearly impossible to count how many are on the market because neither Federal officials , nor Congress , nor the manufacturers can agree on the characteristics of a Saturday night special . <> <> Concealability Cited // As a result , no arms manufacturer will admit to producing the guns . And while gun control activists have based their definition on the concealability of the weapons , some manufacturers are quick to point out that many concealable weapons are neither cheap nor poorly made , and many large weapons are , by any measure of quality , Saturday night specials. // Any Federal regulation at all meets some opposition from the industry , which partly because of its age , and partly because of the political power of its lobby , has been unusually free of regulation. // To start up a gun manufacturing business , one need only pay the Treasury Department a $50 fee and fill out a few forms . As of Dec. 31 , 1980 , the department listed 496 licensed manufacturers , all but a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The largest manufacturers of handguns are Smith &; Wesson , Sturm Ruger and Colt Industries. // Once in business , a manufacturer need only stamp a serial number on each gun produced and then file that information . A 10 percent Federal excise tax is levied on manufacturers ' sales . <> <> Traditional Secrecy Tightened // Secrecy has traditionally enshrouded the handgun industry . That secrecy has tightened since President Reagan was shot with a . 22-caliber revolver made by R.G. Industries of Miami . None of the halfdozen arms manufacturing officials contacted would consent to interviews , although some made brief comments. // What little that can be learned about Saturday night specials must be inferred from fairly scanty statistics compiled by Federal agencies and through discussions with experts familiar with the handgun industry . For example , by any definition , a Saturday night special shoots a bullet no larger than . 32 caliber and records compiled by the Treasury Depatment ' s Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms indicate that approximately 1. 17 million such pistols and revolvers were legally manufactured in the nation during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful because many smallcaliber weapons are highly priced precision instruments used by amateurs for target practice . The guns that police offcials say are most often used in street crime , in contrast , are usually inexpensive and inaccurate . <> <> No Agreement on Definition // The problem with keeping small cheap guns off the market is complicated by the fact that no one can agree on what constitutes a Saturday night special , making it especially difficult to determine how many exist and who produces them. // " The problem is definition , and I can ' t define them , " said C. Edward Rowe , president of Harrington &; Richardson , a 111-year-old Massachusetts-based gun manufacturer . All of the commonly used means of defining the guns - by price , by concealability , by barrel length and by the melting temperature of the metal ( usually an indication of value ) - have major failings. // Price is a poor measure because many of the guns that come into the hands of criminals are high-quality weapons that have been stolen . <> <> Barrel Can Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for regulation because a long barrel can easily be sawed off by anyone intent on concealing the weapon. // Consequently , the firearms bureau , which is authorized by the Gun Control Act of 1968 to restrict the importation of guns not " readily adaptable to sporting purposes , " uses several factors in evaluating each model on a numerical scale . Guns that fail to pass a threshold number on the scale are not allowed to be imported. // Under a bill introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr . , Democrat of New Jersey , earlier this month , the bureau ' s " factoring criteria " for handguns would be applied to domestic production as well . A similar effort to apply the importation standard to domestically manufactured guns was approved by the Senate in 1972 , but after heavy opposition from the National Rifle Association it died in the House of Representatives . Some Federal officials acknowledge privately that many of the guns made by American manufacturers would be illegal if they were imported . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concedes that the current gun importation law is easily evaded . Companies such as R.G. Industries - the maker of the weapon used in the Reagan shooting - import some gun parts , which are not covered by any Federal statutes , and assemble them in this country . Most retail for as little as $35. // Thus , the major gun manufacturers find themselves in a dilemma . On the one hand , many would be pleased to see the Government announce a definition of Saturday night specials that would eliminate the production of the less expensive guns , especially the ones that use imported parts. // On the other hand , most are reluctant to see the adoption of any definition that could be used to limit production of their own domestically produced weapons . Harrington &; Richardson , for example , makes a . 22-caliber revolver priced at $60 , but company officials say that it is a " quality weapon , " unlike the less expensive products of R.G. Industries . Thus , the major gun manufacturers find themselves in a dilemma .
