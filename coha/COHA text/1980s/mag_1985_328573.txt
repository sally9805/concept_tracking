Soon after Patti Frustaci gave birth to a son , Joseph , she and her husband Sam decided they wanted another child . So Patti , 30 , was put back on Pergonal , the fertility drug that had helped her conceive Joseph . The couple was aware that Pergonal increases the chance of multiple births , * but even so , says Sam Frustaci , 32 , " we thought it might be fun to have twins . " Last week the Frustacis got more than they bargained for . As a 40-member team of doctors , nurses and technicians crowded a special operating room at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange , Calif. , Patti gave birth by caesarean section over three minutes to a staggering procession of babies : girl , boy , boy , girl , boy , boy . A seventh child , a girl , was stillborn . It was the largest multiple birth ever recorded in the U.S. <P> The infants , known only as Babies A through F , weighed in at just 1 lb. 1 oz. to 1 lb. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care unit of nearby Childrens Hospital , where they were put on respirators . Said their father , an industrial-equipment salesman : " It 's a unique experience to see them so small , so helpless , and to know that they 're fighting for their lives . " By week 's end Baby F had lost the struggle . <P> Delivered nearly twelve weeks early , the infants suffered from a host of complications associated with premature birth . The major one : hyaline membrane disease , caused by the inability of only partially developed lungs to produce enough <P> surfactant , a fatty substance that helps keep the lungs flexible and prevents the air sacs from collapsing after each breath . To keep the airways clear , nurses trained to notice even the most subtle change in breathing patterns regularly suctioned the infants ' mouths . <P> Each of the babies also had a circulatory problem known as patent ductus arteriosus . In a fetus , two of the heart 's main blood vessels , the aorta and pulmonary artery , are connected by a short channel . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or soon afterward , but in premature babies it often remains open . Result : too much blood is sent to the lungs , and the heart must work harder . To help correct the condition , the children were given the drug indomethacin , which decreases the body 's production of a chemical that keeps the shunt open . The babies also suffered from jaundice , because their immature livers were unable to filter their blood properly , resulting in an excess of yellow bile pigments . To break down the pigments , doctors bathed the children in light from fluorescent lamps . <P> Even intensive treatment had its hazards , putting greater stress on the infants . They were so tiny that each day 's blood tests siphoned off 10% of their blood , necessitating transfusions . Doctors guessed that their chances of surviving might be 50% . Baby F , the smallest , had been considered at greatest risk ; at one point , his weight had dropped to a mere 1 lb . Affectionately dubbed " Peanut " by the staff , he could be held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " They are all critically ill , but they are fighters . " Their father was hopeful as well , and delighted by their liveliness . Said Frustaci after touching them during one visit : " They were kicking like little polliwogs. "
