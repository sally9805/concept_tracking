For one brief inning yesterday , Red Sox catcher Gary Allenson felt like king of the hill . Sure , the White Sox had stolen a couple of bases off him , and there were some pitches he wished he hadn ' t called . But for seven innings , Allenson did very nicely as the heir apparent to Carlton Fisk . " Too bad it didn ' t rain , " said Allenson . Too bad , indeed . For in the final two innings , Chicago rallied for five runs , including three on a home run by that man Fisk in the eighth inning . It made Allenson ' s seventh-inning solo shot into the right-field bullpen pale incomparison . Fisk is gone and Allenson is the No. 1 man . But there is still a gap between the legend and the man who must erase it . " I know I can do better , " he said . " I hit the ball pretty good once . But I didn ' t catch as well as I can , and I didn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still feel I ' m a good catcher . " I have no hard feelings against Fisk . In fact , he has helped me quite a bit . If he had been around this year and ahead of me , I would have understood . But with him gone , I definitely consider myself the No. 1 catcher . I know I ' m better than some of the names I heard they were talking about trading for . " He was one of several new faces in the Red Sox lineup yesterday for the opener against the White Sox . Glenn Hoffman made his debut at shortstop , where he replaced Rick Burleson . He was nervous and made two pop flys to short into full-scale adventures . But Dennis Eckersley pitched out of both jams created by Hoffman ' s mistakes . " I was a little nervous and excited , " said Hoffman . " I have no excuses for those popups that fell in . The first one , I didn ' t know what to do because of the sun and wind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball like that . I ' m not worried about playing short . I got a lot of confidence in the last few weeks of spring training . " Joe Rudi was a new face for the Sox , and was rushed into service due to the back injury of Carl Yastrzemski , who missed his first opener in 21 years . Rudi went 0 for 3 but hit the ball hard twice . In the ninth , he came up as the winning run , but flied out to center . " I just got under the ball , " said Rudi . " But I feel good at the plate . I hit two balls hard and got nothing . That ' s just how it goes . " In retrospect , it went pretty well for Allenson , considering that he is a man with a second chance at stardom with the Red Sox . He is no rookie , having caught in 104 games in 1979 when both Fisk and Bob Montgomery , who were ahead of him , were hurt . He was the backup catcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 24 games , he wound up as a valuable asset to the club because of his hitting ( .356 in 70 plate appearences ) . When Allenson took the field yesterday , it marked his first appearance on Opening Day at Fenway Park . But if he was nervous , it didn ' t show . " I think considering the Fisk stuff and the crowd , " he said , " I felt pretty good . If there was pressure , I didn ' t feel it . I just went out and did my job . " The job , said Allenson , is a lot tougher than it looks from the stands . For one thing , the Red Sox are no longer in Winter Haven , where gentle breezes have been replaced by gusty wind currents . Instead of a friendly orange grove , he was looking into the glare of white shirts in straightaway center , which didn ' t help his catching , and certainly not his hitting . " Fisk and I were saying how tough it was to pick up the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glare was tremendous , and I figured as the shadows lengthened , the background might be better . But it was worse . You could barely pick up any breaking ball , and their pitcher ( Britt Burns ) was throwing some great ones . You could pick up a straight fastball , however , for some reason . I guess it might take a little bit for the hitters to adjust to day ball here . Both sides were having trouble seeing the ball . " Fisk didn ' t in the seventh , when he hit his three-run homer off Bob Stanley . Allenson said the home run had very little to do with the fact that Fisk probably knows as much about the " Vulture " as he did . " Fisk is a good low-ball hitter , " said Allenson . " And Stanley is a low- ball pitcher . It was strength against strength and Fisk won this time . I don ' t think Bob wanted the ball as high as he got it . " That ' s exactly right , and Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher or catcher on how they pitched Fisk . " We had done a pretty good job on him until that point , " said Houk . " And I ' ll tell you now that I ' d send Stanley and his good sinker out against any hitter . If he keeps the ball down where he normally does , there is no way any hitter is going to get it into the air . "
