Valentine 's Day approaches . So many hearts still to be won , muses Captain Midlife as he studies his magnified decaying face in the shaving mirror , while striving to put the picture of T.S . Eliot 's Sweeney out of his mind . <P> Out of his mind , indeed . The quavering romantic nature flops like a landed fish but never expires entirely , our middle-aged boy discovers . Debts pound at the door like crazy firemen ; responsibilities rise like dunes on the Cape ; girls in their 20s call him Sir ( Oh , call me Captain ) ; and still our hero hopes . Will love come to Captain Midlife ? Has it been there all along ? Stay tuned as the insomniac , not-yet-ancient mariner rests his head on the railing at a Knicks-Bulls game in which he is Air-Jordaning three feet over the rim one moment and the next eloping in a Chevrolet Impala with that remarkably attractive blond behind the refreshment stand , the one lathering mustard on the franks . <P> He could build a wonderful life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pass delightful days discussing the netherworld of basketball arenas , talking of crowd control , relish , ramps . Or would it be better to start life over again with the lady cop in the subway ? She looked mighty fetching in blue . A life of summonses and judo . Or the solemn woman at the rent-a-car counter ? A prospect of long nights spent writing their initials inside little circles . The cashier at the A &P?; The jogger with the Westie ? The Captain confesses that he is much taken with that lanky public defender on TV , the one who never smiles and who dresses like Alcott and Andrews . Late dinner conversations on civil rights and torts ( Have a tort ? ) . How about Alcott , or Andrews ? <P> You see , Captain Midlife has never got it into his thick if frangible skull that his life is exactly where it is , consisting of a loving wife , three loving children and a loving dog , which , while no Westie , has much fine oddness to recommend it . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . When he does not , his mind packs up its belongings and sets sail like Ulysses ( the very first Captain Midlife ) , hopping from port to port , dreaming up a storm . The Captain knows too well what the voyage of Ulysses was all about . Circe gives the old come-hither . Calypso does her little dance . The Sirens sing . No need to tie the buzzard to the mast . He 's been tied there all along . The Odyssey : one long wild fling . <P> But in reality the Captain stays close to shore these days , and there he often amazes himself by falling in love with his actual surroundings . Middle age expands one 's range of loving , discovers Captain Midlife . The objects of his deepest affection are things he once ignored or took for granted . <P> Such as his house . Suddenly the Captain finds that he cares strongly for his house : tables , doorknobs , chests of drawers . Finicky as a clerk , he keeps his house shipshape , puts up a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloppy ? Everything in its place , replies the Captain , who finds himself included in the everything .
