A time-honored way to start a successful bank is to identify it with a booming local industry , a tactic that has worked for the likes of both the giant Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York City ( deposits : $41 billion ) and the little Farmers &; Merchants National Bank in Rensselaer , Ind . ( deposits : $50 million ) . Now two California banks that plan to open later this year are using the strategy : Silicon Valley Bank and High Tech National Bank . <P> " We want to be the banker for the electronics industry , " says Roger Smith , Silicon Valley 's president . His bank , with headquarters in a San Jose industrial building , will offer services like equipment financing for new companies . High Tech National Bank will go after the microchip money brought home by electronics entrepreneurs to the Silicon Valley suburb Los Gatos ( pop . 28,000 ) . Local residents include Steven Jobs , 28 , chairman of Apple Computer , who is worth an estimated $200 million .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
