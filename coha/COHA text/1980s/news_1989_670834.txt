But yesterday more than 200 tenants from three apartment buildings on Gramercy Park South were girding for the start of another workweek without homes , without possessions - and , many say , without answers about the course of their lives over coming weeks. // " Everybody ' s very tense , " said Pat Snyderman , a member of the board of the apartment cooperative at 32 Gramercy Park South . " You say a wrong word and everybody gets upset , because they ' re just beside themselves . Nobody knows where they ' re going to go or what ' s happening. " // She and the others are among the additional casualties of the long night of Aug. 19 , when a Consolidated Edison steam pipe exploded like a volcano under their street , killing three people , injuring 24 and terrifying thousands . But the explosion was only the beginning ; for nearly four hours after the blast , a huge column of steam rose from the shattered street , coating buildings all over the neighborhood with a mist of brown mud. // Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mud-spattered apartments , Con Edison and the city belatedly confirmed what the tenants at 32 Gramercy Park South had discovered hours before on their own : that the mud contained high levels of potentially cancer-causing asbestos. // Beginning Wednesday night , residents of the three buildings had to abandon their homes for the second time in four days . Soon after , city environmental officials were predicting that the removal of the microscopic asbestos fibers , a complex , painstaking process , would take a least four weeks - and that was just the outdoor problem . <> <> A Piece of Their Mind // Across the park from the Gramercy Park Hotel , where displaced tenants were occupying 123 rooms at Con Edison ' s expense , workmen wearing respirators , hard hats and protective suits were removing asbestos-contaminated mud from a 100-yard stretch of street in front of four apartment buildings and a synagogue on Gramercy Park South. // " What ' s going on there is like something out of the ' Andromeda Strain , ' " said Sheldon Adler , a lawyer who heads the co-op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be totally decontaminated when they leave the area . " On Friday night Mr. Adler and about 100 other residents met with Con Edison officials at the hotel and gave them a piece of their mind. // " I got up and I said , ' It ' s a well-established fact that all steam pipes are insulated with asbestos - you knew it , you have specs in your office , and yet you let our people go back in the building on Saturday night and you let them stay there for four days and you never told anybody about this . If we didn ' t happen to find out about it on our own , you would have never told anybody. ' // " And they just sat there stoically . They had no response , absolutely no response , except to say that they ran their own tests on Saturday and they didn ' t find asbestos. " // John Meyer , a marketing executive at a publishing company , whose wife , Susan Saltrick , is a week overdue with their first child , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not prepared to answer in the slightest . We needed to hear from a doctor really or some city agency . I ' m not sure we trust Con Edison . But nobody from the city showed up. // " That ' s the thing I find most frustrating . Nobody from the city has managed to communicate with us to tell us what ' s going on . " <> <> ' The End of My Rope ' // Jocelyn Kaplan , who runs her own insurance company , still goes to work every morning before 8 : 30 . But yesterday the strain of the last week was starting to show . Mrs. Kaplan is 80 years old. // " That apartment has been my home for close to 30 years , " she said of her rooms at 32 Gramercy Park South , " and I ' m afraid that everything in it that I love is going to be destroyed and that I ' ll never go back there. " // " They told me I could take nothing , that everything in my apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They said I was wearing contaminated clothing , including the coat I had until yesterday , when some friends brought me some new clothes. // " After the explosion on Saturday , I went back into the apartment and stayed there the rest of the time , never realizing the danger. // " When they told me Wednesday night I had to vacate again , I said : ' Forget it - I ' ve reached the end of my rope . I just can ' t handle it . ' I told them the worst that can happen is I ' ll die , that ' s all. // " I ' ve been making my own way , alone , for a long time . I ' ve had a lot of unfortunate deaths in my family . But this is the first time in my life that I can not cope with something . " <> <> What About the Children ? // Thierry Da Rold and John Nestor , neighbors at 32 Gramercy Park South , are worried about where they are going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations next week. // They say Con Edison officials have told them and others that they can not guarantee that the utility will pay to relocate people with small children from the hotel to what the parents feel would be safer lodgings. // " It ' s an old hotel , it ' s very clean - I think it ' s fine for an adult , " said Mr. Da Rold , the art director of an advertising concern . " But this place is totally unsafe for a child . For instance , there ' s no bars on the windows . But the first thing my 2 1/2-year-old son is going to do is climb on top of the radiator and look out the window . " <> <> Real-Estate Value : ' Nil ' // Besides people , real-estate values are suffering. // " We were going to sell our place and get a two-bedroom for the baby , " said Ms. Saltrick , an editor at a book publishing company . " We had a buyer , who even after the explosion Saturday night was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the asbestos problem , it looks like his bank won ' t approve a mortage . I can ' t say as I blame them. // " His bank told him , and this is a quote : ' Market values in that building are virtually nil . ' " <> <> No Place for Orchids // Judith Weinberg had just arrived from a meeting of the Greater New York Orchid Society on Wednesday night when she learned that 32 Gramercy Park South was being evacuated. // Apart from her collection of 300 orchids , which she suspects " is all going to go down the drain , " she is frantic about a presentation she has to give this week at a meeting of the American Jewish Committee , one of many charitable groups she has been working for since her retirement. // " Everything I need for the meeting is in a batch of papers on my dining room table , and no one will get it for me , " she said . <> <> Don ' t Forget the Mail // " Our mail is askew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , " said Rose Mary Rozende , who has not seen her apartment at 31 Gramercy Park South since Thursday. // " The mail situation is very difficult for the elderly and infirm , " said Judith Weinberg . " They have to go all the way over to our post office at Fourth Avenue and 11th Street to get it. " // Blanche Poss , a resident of 32 Gramercy Park South , said : " I ' m recovering from bilateral knee surgery and a broken back , and it ' s extremely difficult for me to get around. // " This whole business has left me just numb . But I don ' t even know who to be angry at. " //
