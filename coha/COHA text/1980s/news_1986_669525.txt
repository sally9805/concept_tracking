Through most of the last six months , until May , bonds have led stocks on a high-speed , highly profitable chase . Then bonds skidded into the pits and now stocks are left careening on an uncertain track. // This past week , the Dow Jones industrial average posted an 11. 71-point loss , closing at 1 , 874. 19 . In a buying surge on Friday , investors in the blue-chip issues overcame qualms , and the Dow regained most of the record 45. 75 points lost on Monday. // // Buyers of over-the-counter stocks took a less volatile course , pushing prices steadily higher . In fact , so far this year the NASDAQ composite index is up 22 percent , outpacing the Dow ' s 19 percent run-up. // Among the big movers last week : Financial News Network , Horn &; Hardart , and a stock called C.O.M.B. FNN ' s price doubled on reports it is considering going into the cable-TV telemarketing business. // The excitement stems from the meteoric debut of Home Shopping Network , a lucrative telemarketer . It went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about $75. // But such euphoria passed by the more economically sensitive Dow stocks . At the heart of last week ' s concerns : refinancing Mexico ' s heavy debt and getting a reading on a United States economy that ' s offering no outright assurances that it might be upshifting or downshifting. // That has kept investors wondering : Is the equity market going to be driven by falling interest rates or by an upturn in corporate earnings ? // Last week ' s unexpectedly weak retail sales figures for May bolstered the lower-interest-rate theory . Market strategist John D. Connolly of Dean Witter Reynolds expects events outside the US to provide the leeway for lower rates here. // The none-too-robust economies of Europe and Japan , coupled with pending elections in both Germany and Japan , could provide the political incentive for central banks to drop interest rates to spur business activity. // Morgan Stanley &; Co. ' s Byron R. Wien , who has just returned from London , Vienna , and Florence , says European investment bankers have similar expectations for lower rates. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasters are taking refuge in cash. // For the first time in six months , E. F. Hutton &; Co. recently went from zero to 10 percent cash in its model portfolio ( 60 percent equities , 30 percent bonds ) . Hutton is recommending lightening up on interest-rate-sensitive stocks. // Another member of the yellow-flag club , newsletter maven Howard Ruff , states in a recent issue that ' ' this bull market has one more leg up , but after a massive , overdue correction. ' ' // Using his charts of moving averages , Ruff figures a 200- to 300-point drop in the Dow ought to be adequate. // Ricky Harrington finds that a bit overdone for his technical tastes . ' ' My worst case is a fall to 1 , 750 to 1 , 800 , ' ' says Mr. Harrington , director of analysis at Interstate Securities in Charlotte , N.C. ' ' We ' ll resume the upswing later this summer , perhaps as soon as later this month . I think we ' re likely to do 2 , 200 to 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in the face of negative technical signs . Last week , bears let out an approving growl when new lows on the NYSE exceeded the number of new highs for the first time this year. // New issue-volume that is fast approaching record heights also strikes many as a warning signal . And the Dow utility and transport indexes failed to reach new highs when the Dow industrials did on June 6 - another portent of down markets to come , Dow market theorists say. // But Harrington remains sanguine . ' ' This is simply a bull-market correction that ' s nearly over . More important than those ' mechanical ' indicators are the sentiment and liquidity indicators. ' ' // He looks at the $225 billion invested in money market funds and the rising number of investors turning sour on stocks. // Harrington reasons : ' ' Everybody ' s nervous . Everybody ' s looking for a decline , so it ' s less likely to happen. ' ' // Far from Wall Street ' s cement canyons , Michael W. Lamb ' s attention is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this Kansas City-based investment adviser is tracking , as Mr. Lamb dubs them , the ' ' power investors. ' ' // Through Securities and Exchange Commission filings and the grapevine , he shadows trades of some two dozen proven stock pickers , including Warren Buffett , Ivan Boesky , the Bass brothers , and Irwin Jacobs. // Mr. Lamb , a former PaineWebber broker , doesn ' t follow in lock step , preferring to do his own research before making his move . ' ' We ask ourselves two questions before buying , ' ' he says . ' ' Why did they make that purchase , and why now ? ' ' // Because of the lag between , say , a Bass brothers buy and when the SEC data become public , Lamb sometimes finds the price has become too rich for him to follow suit immediately . But on the sell side , Lamb follows his model investors strictly. // The performance record of his Wealth Monitors newsletter is short but impressive . Lamb says that out of 18 stocks bought and sold since January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one lost money. // Lamb claims a 44 percent annualized gain . Last month he founded a mutual fund under the Wealth Monitor name. // ' ' People say , ' It sounds so simple , ' ' ' he says . ' ' It is . We have inherent in our beliefs that something has to be complicated to be successful. ' ' // The method works , he says , because ' ' the people we follow cause things to happen . They ' re not passive . The average investor does his research , invests , and hopes and waits . These guys can and do tell management what to do. ' ' // Lately , Lamb concedes , the pickings have been thinning out . The corporate-takeover kings have grown quiescent . Last month , Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders flatly : There are no bargains in this market. // Still , Lamb remains enthusiastic about several issues , including a thinly traded , speculative OTC stock : Southland Financial. // Arbitrageur Ivan Boesky owns nearly 10 percent of this Dallas-area real estate developer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Boesky bought his stake at an average price of $32 a share. // Southland Financial , he says , is now trading at about $20 . Recently , Boesky turned down an offer for more than $32 a share , Lamb says. // Two recent appraisals , he says , show the land Southland Financial bought in 1929 is worth enough so that the stock could be valued at $60 a share. // It is such smart-money deals that Lamb finds attractive . **22;45863; <> **44;45887; **42;45933; <> **76;45977; **28;46055; Interest <> <> **76;46085; **28;46163; rates <> **28;46193; Percent <> <> **76;46223; <> Prime rate <> **26;46301; 8. 50 <> <> **76;46329; <> Discount rate <> **26;46407; 6. 50 <> <> **76;46435; <> Federal funds <> **26;46513; 7. 00 <> <> **76;46541; <> 3-mo .
