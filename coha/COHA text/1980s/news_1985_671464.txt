Lately , the loudspeakers have been cranked up again , but not for the thoughts of Mao Zedong . Characteristic of the new China of Deng Xiaoping , the message blasting forth in recent weeks has been strictly down-to-earth , demanding that citizens forsake spitting on penalty of an on-the-spot fine of 18 cents. // A habit that went out of style in America at the turn of the century has continued to flourish here , even in the highest places . Mr. Deng himself has been known to use the spittoons in the Great Hall of the People as a sort of conversational punctuation point . But now he and other leaders have thrown their weight behind a public health campaign that depicts hawking in public as a major social ill. // On special campaign days , as many as 150 , 000 health inspectors roam the streets of this city of 9. 5 million , handing out pamphlets and fines . Stalls are set up at busy intersections where offenders are required to peer through microscopes at bacteria . Leaflets solemnly advise that tests of spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a tuberculosis virus that can survive for eight months. // Adults who may have thought that they had seen the last of youthful zealotry on the streets when Mao ' s Cultural Revolution ended have found themselves confronted at bus stops by flag-waving schoolchildren chanting : " To spit on the streets is unhealthy . On no account spit on the ground . " Mr. Deng ' s emphasis on improving living standards has made him enormously popular , probably more so than any other Chinese leader since the honeymoon period Mao enjoyed after the revolution in 1949 . But his " second revolution " has not been without its rough patches . Lately , the grumbling has centered on the city ' s vegetable markets , where the onset of summer has been accompanied by scarcity and high prices. // In a bid to enliven the economy , the country is shifting rapidly from state-regulated prices to prices set in the marketplace . When state subsidies were removed from the produce reaching Peking ' s markets last month , the prices of hundreds of basic items , from beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was given an additional $2. 63 a month , but many families found themselves in a squeeze. // Matters got worse when it developed that peasants in the Peking region , exercising a freedom bestowed on them by another of Mr. Deng ' s policy changes , had shifted from vegetables into other , more profitable crops at the winter planting . By the end of May , people were finding empty counters at the markets , or paying prices that were up three or four times from last year. // By past standards , city officials reacted swiftly . After an emergency meeting , the city announced that it was re-introducing subsidies on cabbages , cucumbers and tomatoes , as well as on other produce . At the same time , a ban on peasants from outside the Peking region bringing their vegetables into town by truck , tractor and horse-drawn cart - another Deng innovation , designed to cut traffic density in the capital - was lifted. // Prices tumbled , in most cases back to levels only 20 or 30 percent up from last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 1. 7 million tons of produce arrived at the markets , six times as much as in the previous four days . Shortages continue , but officials say the situation will right itself by midsummer as peasants react to the higher procurement prices and shift back to vegetable-growing. // In the meantime , the rising prices have given rise to what passes for a Chinese political joke . Referring to Mr. Deng ' s height - he is slightly under five feet tall - Peking residents have taken to saying affectionately , " Everything ' s going up around here - except Deng. " // Under prodding from Mr. Deng , officials at all levels are having to stay tuned to the public mood . Opinion polls , unknown under Mao , are commissioned with increasing frequency to test the effectiveness of the new policies . To nobody ' s surprise - it is still a Communist country - none of the polls published so far have gone against the Government , but some have been revealing nonetheless. // Recently , the National Economic Reform Institute and Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price increases taken in Peking and four major provinces . Of the 2 , 500 people polled , 77 percent were said to have agreed that the price rises were " beneficial to the country , " but 57 percent said they would rather have had their wages frozen . Intriguingly , only 86 percent expressed confidence that the Government " would not take advantage " of consumers through the policy changes. // One measure of the Government ' s growing responsiveness came in an incident in the Chaoyang district of Peking , the capital ' s largest , where many of the 1. 1 million households were up in arms over the construction of a tea trading center in a " street garden " in the Dongdaqiao neighborhood . The garden serves as the neighborhood ' s principal recreation area , and the center took up a sixth of the space used by residents to stroll , play cards and practice the traditional art of shadow-boxing. // According to accounts in the local newpapers , complaints about the tea center poured into the mayor ' s office . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for himself , and ordered the tea center knocked down . Forthwith , workers destroyed a structure that cost $105 , 000 only six months ago . The catch for residents was that the center ' s revenues will not now be available for the district ' s " green belt " program , under which trees and grass are to be planted in the dusty corridors between residential buildings. // When the Ming emperors adopted Peking as the capital in the 14th century , and the Communists moved it back here again in 1949 , they did not reckon with the mix of bitter winters and muggy summers that prevail on the north China plain . With temperatures in summer reaching 100 degrees , and humidity at saturation point , talk at this time of the year often turns to one of the favorite ways of cooling off - eating watermelons. // Here , too , there are signs of the new market consciousness . Lately , Peking residents have been promised that this year will see a bumper crop of the melons , which are already appearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peasants around Peking have sown an additional 5 , 000 acres with the crop , with special emphasis on the Zhengzhou No. 3 variety that was last year ' s favorite. // City authorities have also announced an increase in the quantities of ice cream , popsicles and juice available from the handcarts that dot city streets . Many of these are operated by entrepreneurs benefiting from Mr. Deng ' s encouragement of small-scale capitalism , but as with the new price policies , there are problems . Spot checks have shown that many of the juices fail bacteria tests by a wide margin , and officials have sent their purveyors packing. //
