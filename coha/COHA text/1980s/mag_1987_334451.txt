The statuesque white-tailed buck grazes along a roadside in rural Virginia . Passing hunters slow their cars , aim their high-powered rifles out the window and fire  --  then fire again when the deer neither falls nor flees . Three police cruisers suddenly surround the cars , and the hapless hunters discover they are the targets of a sting dubbed Bambiscam . <P> In response to complaints that poachers were illegally shooting deer from their cars , Virginia game officials purchased a stuffed buck , named him Sucker and placed him near a roadside . The four-day sting operation led to eleven convictions on 23 separate charges . Sucker has proved such an attractive target that he has been taken to a taxidermist to have his bullet holes restuffed . Said Game Warden Jim Bankston : " That 's one thing we learned about illegal hunters . Most of them are pretty good shots . "
