Major TIME stories often involve a careful dialogue , and negotiation , between correspondents in the field and writers in the New York City office . But the partnership behind this week 's cover story on political action committees was unusually close . Correspondent Evan Thomas , who suggested the story and reported it from Capitol Hill , and Associate Editor Walter Isaacson , who wrote it , were friends at Harvard a decade ago . Their paths recrossed in 1978 , when both joined TIME as staff writers in New York . Then , again almost simultaneously , both transferred to TIME 'S Washington bureau . Isaacson returned to New York in 1981 , and the two have collaborated since as reporter and writer on numerous articles , including last year 's cover story on the politics of abortion and this year 's profile of Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker . <P> Two months ago , when Thomas began thinking about a story on PACs , he flew to New York to discuss it with Isaacson . From his Washington perspective , Thomas was " struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Isaacson observed that " PACs have changed the nature of political campaigning-and of the legislative process . " Once the project was approved , they continued to talk by phone two or three times each day . While Thomas interviewed dozens of Congressmen , lobbyists and academics , each of TIME 'S U.S. bureaus filed extensive reports to Isaacson . " We used our normal system , " says Senior Editor Stephen Smith , " and because of their friendship and long hours of planning , the story developed with unusual smoothness and coherence . " <P> <P> Like many large and diversified corporations , Time Inc. has a PAC . It contributed a total of $46,730 in 1981 and 1982 to congressional candidates and political and party organizations . The PAC is under the jurisdiction of Time Inc. ' s business management , which has no authority over editorial policy . The editors of Time Inc.do not participate in these decisions-or know the identities of the recipients . The company 's forest products subsidiaries have their own PACs : Inland Container Corp . gave $15,200 in 1981-82 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981-82 to candidates for state and local office in Texas .
