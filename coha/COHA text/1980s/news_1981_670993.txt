Yet , 29 days and one tropical storm after they reached the spot where the the Andrea Doria sank 200 feet to the ocean bottom 25 years ago , an expedition of weary deep-sea divers led by Peter Gimbel reported yesterday that they had found one of the ship ' s two safes and had brought it to the surface . The safes were rumored to contain more than $1 million in cash and jewelry. // The second safe has not been found , if it is there in the rubble of the first-class foyer of the Italian luxury liner . Nor have the divers been able to reach a critical watertight door that is the chief object of the expedition , according to its backers . <> <> Door Linked to Ship ' s Sinking // Recent speculation has held that the door was either missing or ajar when the ship was rammed by the Swedish liner Stockholm in fog July 25 , 1956 , about 50 miles off Nantucket , Mass . A breach between compartments was said to be the principal reason that the Doria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collision. // Mr. Gimbel , a member of the depart-ment store family , said as he embarked on his expedition that he was uncertain whether any lawsuits would be filed by survivors or relatives of victims of the disaster if the door was found to be missing because so much time had elapsed since the sinking. // It has been estimated that 50 people died after the collision , including five on the Swedish vessel . Mr. Gimbel , 53 years old , said he had been told , however , that his progress would be watched closely by lawyers everywhere . He said he wanted to lay the matter to rest . No legal determination on liability for the disaster has ever been made . <> <> Divers Have 2 Objectives // And so the two teams of divers operating from the Sea Level 11 , the workboat anchored above the wreck , had two objectives yesterday . Reports from the boat said that Mr. Gimbel , a seasoned diver , had made his way to the area where he believed the mystery door to be. // " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an actress from West Germany who is Mr. Gimbel ' s wife and co-producer of the film being made of their quest . Miss Andersen , reached yesterday by radiotelephone aboard the Sea Level 11 , said of Mr. Gimbel : " He has been down there since 7 : 30 this morning . It is now 1 : 30 and they are still at it . But we must try . We are running out of time and so we must make up for it with longer dives. " // The sophisticated equipment being used in the exploration of the wreck was leased by Mr. Gimbel for one month , which will soon be up . Mr. Gimbel would not disclose the cost of the project , but sources familiar with the equipment have estimated it to be about $30 , 000 a day. // Dives of up to eight hours are possible because the Gimbel expedition is using a technique called " saturation diving , " which requires the divers to live in pressurized chambers aboard the ship , simulating the pressure at 140 feet below the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then lowered to 15 feet above the wreck . The divers emerge , and are able to work for hours without having to go through the usual , time-consuming process of decompression. // Miss Andersen said that divers using acetylene torches had freed the safe of the Bank of Rome from its place in the foyer . Late last night , Kenneth Wilkerson of Church Point , La. , the Sea Level 11 ' s captain , said the safe had been brought aboard the vessel. // The safes are rumored to contain valuables worth at least $1 million , mostly in United States currency and jewels that were left behind when passengers abandoned ship . The safe will be kept in water after it has been brought aboard the Sea Level 11 , because if water has seeped into the safe , which was designed to be watertight , exposure to the air now might cause the money inside to disintegrate. // If the safe is brought to the surface , it will not be opened right away . Mr. Gimbel plans to open it on a live broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Doria : The Final Chapter . " <> <> Morale Reported High // The 190-foot workboat being used by the team of 40 persons , including five commercial divers and four diver-cameramen , is anchored in an area of the Atlantic known for its sudden squalls and bad seas . Miss Andersen said everyone involved was exhausted , but that morale remained hgh. // Bad weather has plagued the divers . The worst came in the wake of tropical storm Dennis , which moved through the area last week . But there was an unexpected storm afterward that hit when the divers were below. // " It came on us quickly , " Miss Andersen recalled . " Gimbel went down there to torch the safe out and 45 minutes later , all hell broke lose out here . We had real bad weather and the captain did beautifully . We didn ' t lose any anchor . The waves were 15 feet and the winds were at 50 knots . I had never been through anything like it before and it was very impressive . The noise of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asked what the divers reported about the condition of the firstclass foyer of the ship that in its day was regarded as the most elegant liner afloat , Miss Andersen said : " There was silt and a lot of boards and linoleum and telephone wires , all sorts of stuff . It looked as though somebody had dropped a hundred-year-old house on top of it. " // Originally , the Gimbel expedition had planned to return to Montauk , L.I. , at the end of August . Miss Andersen said that as of yesterday it seemed more likely that they would not return until next Wednesday or later if there was a chance of achieving an important objective. //
