Seventy-six trombones and 110 cornets may be all very well , but they are n't a patch on 550 flutists . The instrumentalists , who were attending the 14th Annual Flute Convention in New York City , gathered in the plaza at Lincoln Center one morning last week for a " flute-in " ; they included teachers from Kentucky , flute- makers from Connecticut and Suzuki-method pupils from California . As cameras focused in for the Today show , diminutive Irish Pied Piper James Galway led the rows of virtuosos in Danny Boy , then John Denver 's Annie 's Song , which a Galway recording has popularized , and finally Amazing Grace . Why not a classical program ? Says Galway : " What 's the first thing you 'd want to hear in the morning ? Not some flute study . I thought they 'd rather hear a folk tune . "
