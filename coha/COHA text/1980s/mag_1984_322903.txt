Moderates and radicals unite for a statuesque tribute <P> All day they had rallied under the hot sun , a vast throng swelling to embrace 450,000 people . It had been a peaceful demonstration , but now as darkness fell , a few among the crowd became restless . Gathered in Makati , Metro Manila 's high-rise business district , they began setting fire to automobile tires and piles of yellow confetti . With no police or soldiers in sight , predictions by the government of President Ferdinand Marcos that the daylong rally would culminate in violence seemed about to come true . <P> Suddenly a flatbed truck rolled into view , escorted by two motorcycle policemen and by lines of yellow-shirted marchers waving small yellow flags . Aboard the truck was a nearly 7-ft. - high , flower-bedecked bronze statue of Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino Jr. , the Philippine opposition leader slain by an unknown assassin at Manila International Airport on Aug. 21 , 1983 , on his return from exile in the U.S. As spotlights played on the figure , the crowd broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ang Bayan Ko ( My Country ) .

Aware of the significance of the anniversary , the government spared no effort in trying to foil the tribute . Police had dealt harshly with smaller antigovernment rallies in preceding weeks , quickly breaking up the demonstrations with tear gas , truncheons and water cannons . The government also sought to deny a permit for the August Twenty-One Commemoration Committee demonstration , arguing that it would be used by subversive elements for an assault on the President . In a rare rebuff to Marcos , the Supreme Court ruled that the rally should be permitted . <P> Unable to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed out of sight except around the presidential Malacaang Palace . Demonstration Organizer Agapito ( " Butz " ) Aquino , Ninoy 's brother , had feared that the centerpiece of the celebration , the statue , cast in Rome by Philippine Sculptor Tomas Concepcion and flown to Manila via New York City , would be deliberately held up by Philippine customs and had readied a similar statue made of plaster . But after a two-day standoff , during which the bronze was kept at the airport , Marcos ordered $3,970 in duties waived and the figure released .
