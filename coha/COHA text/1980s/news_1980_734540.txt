txt DURING TOE DIETING process ? especially if we have chosen a diet in which we lose weight rapidly  --  the bodily changes make us feel very much the way a youngster feels as she moves from childhood toward adulthood . The physical changes are just as surprising and confusing as the emotional ones . While I was in Durham , I kept is journal . One day I wrote : " I ca n't understand what is happening to me ? I 'm freezing all the time ! I 've lost 18 pounds in 15 days ! I guess my poor body does n't know what hit it . But it is very frightening ; I 've always been too . hot , and so feeling cold all the time makes me imagine I 'm someone else , not myself . That scares me . " I do n't think anything turned out to be more important while I dieted than learning to give myself gifts other than food , to comfort and reward myself . " Walking home from breakfast , I felt discouraged and sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is such a struggle after the first few dramatic weeks . Stopped at a drugstore and bought myself an assortment of makeup ( that I certainly do n't need . Felt 111 e an idiot ? then suddenly realized that I had made a sensational shift in a living pattern . Ordinarily , feeling discouraged or depressed would have driven me into a bakery or to a candy counter . I seem to have shifted to a much more sensible solution . Good for me ! I was giving myself solace ? but not food . " I had promised myself two chill dogs when I lost 40 pounds . Instead , I bought a pair of slacks and two blouses ? three sizes smaller . " MOST OF US tend to be the kind of people who always give things to other people , but find it very difficult to receive . It is time to do something about that while dieting . We need to let the people who care about us know how much their encouragement means to us . I think probably the best words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in Reader 's Digest : " People who want to lose weight , the diet writers say sternly , must adopt a no-nonsense attitude . Hogwash. 11 we 're going to diet , we need all the nonsense we can get . All the soft lights and music and sweet talk and dancing and trips to the racetrack and shopping sprees and everything else that 's fun and calorie-free . " . Eda LeNhan
