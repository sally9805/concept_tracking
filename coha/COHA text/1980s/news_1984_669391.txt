Columbia Point . Only 400 families remain in this 1 , 504-unit oceanfront project - once a crime-ridden , rat-infested den of tension . Now it ' s on the verge of being redeveloped into a peninsular community of about 1 , 500 mixed-income units in a seaside setting . And it will be developed privately. // Franklin Field . This dilapidated housing project in Dorchester is surrounded by abandoned properties in a decaying business area . But now it is being revitalized with federal funds . Neighbors who have been hostile to outsiders and to each other say they are working together to bring a new order . And a new community organization is working to promote recreation , culture , and business enterprise in the neighborhood. // Fidelis Way . Brighton ' s project , built in 1951 , has a history of racial problems . It is being rehabilitated by a private contractor for $26. 2 million . Under the ' ' turn key ' ' arrangement , the contractor invests in improvements such as new wiring , new appliances , landscaping , and paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials for a profit. // ' ' Public housing can no longer be a warehouse for the nonworking class , ' ' says Lewis H. ( Harry ) Spence , head of the Boston Housing Authority ( BHA ) . ' ' Such a condition is dangerous , and Boston can not permit this . If Boston passively allows its public housing to deteriorate , the city is sure to be hurt by the consequences. ' ' // Public housing projects - once considered the panacea for slum dwellers - are becoming enclaves of poverty-stricken , jobless people , says Mr. Spence , who has made a career of turning around troubled projects in a number of Massachusetts cities. // Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn , reversing the policy of former Mayor Kevin H. White , joined with tenants and state and federal officials to support many of Spence ' s policies and changes. // Spence is receiver-administrator of the BHA , the beleaguered landlord to more than 54 , 000 tenants who are 10 percent of the Hub ' s population . In 1979 , Superior Court Judge Paul G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BHA out of the hands of the city ( Perez et al. v. Boston ) . In February 1980 , he named Spence as receiver to straighten up the mismanaged housing authority. // Every six months , Spence reports to Judge Garrity on progress at the BHA and its housing projects . Last February the judge , at the request of tenants and Spence , permitted the BHA to remain in receivership for another year to firm up the changes that have been made under Spence ' s direction. // Yet , not all is working smoothly in the world of public housing . Tenants are not satisfied they are getting their fair share of the city ' s public services , such as police protection and garbage collection. // ' ' The BHA is the city ' s chief landlord , but we tenants are not always included in its planning , ' ' says Steve Holt , director of Tenants United for Public Housing Progress , a organization founded in 1983 to replace the Tenants Policy Council. // ' ' We want to be sure that BHA policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . We want proper police protection . We want all city services other people of Boston get. ' ' // What is the BHA ? What is it doing today ? And what happens when control of public housing is returned to the city ? // Established in 1935 , the BHA is one of the nation ' s oldest public housing agencies . It is the fourth largest authority in the nation with control over 17 , 367 units in 69 developments. // Of this total , 14 , 036 are federally funded , including 10 , 334 family units in 20 projects and 3 , 702 units in 34 developments for the elderly . There are 3 , 331 state-funded units , including 2 , 883 family units in 11 developments and 448 in four projects for the elderly . The BHA also controls 5 , 615 units of leased housing - 5 , 193 federally funded and 422 state-supported units. // Spence hopes to make showcase developments out of three of the city ' s least inviting multifamily projects : Columbia Point , Fidelis Way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the current policy of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) to upgrade and modernize the nation ' s public housing stock. // Under the Reagan administration , HUD is no longer investing money into building mass public housing . The changeover of Columbia Point to private management and mixed housing is modeled after King ' s Lynne , a successful conversion of an infamous public housing project into a privately managed mixed-housing development in Lynn , Mass . The Columbia Point design - in the works since 1979 - involves the entire Columbia Point Peninsula , which includes the John F. Kennedy Library , the University of Massachusetts at Boston , the Bank of Boston , the revitalized Bay State Mall , and the public housing tenants. // Because of two recent breakthroughs , Columbia Point may be transferred to private developers before the end of the year , says Ralph Memolo , spokesman for the Boston Redevelopment Agency ( BRA ) , the city ' s planning agency. // First , HUD has finally agreed to subsidize the 400 low-cost units that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Urban Development Action Grant - is expected from HUD by fall. // Second , the BRA has applied for $90 million in construction financing from the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency . ' ' This provides mortgage guarantees for the project , ' ' Mr. Memolo says. // He adds that the two main competitors - Corcoran , Mullins , and Jennison of Quincy ( developers of King ' s Lynne ) and National Housing Partnership of Washington - have joined with the Columbia Point Tenants Task Force to win the development contract from the BHA. // The $136 million Columbia Point package - of which about $16 million will come from developers - is expected to include lowering the height of the high-rise family dwellings , luxury housing for all tenants ( rent for the 400 families will be subsidized ) , a new shopping mall , and recreational facilities such as tennis courts and a swimming pool near the beach. // At Franklin Field in Dorchester , renovation is based on another concept : improving the facilities and the residents ' outlook . The entire project is now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Franklin Field Corporation - a new nonprofit , tax-exempt agency - is planning programs for residents such as entertainment , job training , and sports programs. // ' ' Critics say residents will tear up their new apartments , will not take care of their freshly landscaped lawns , ' ' says Imani Kazana , president of the Franklin Field Corporation and a nonresident . ' ' I say it takes time to teach people . And motivation to achieve grows when people appreciate the improvements made. ' ' // By the end of the year , Spence plans to leave his job , a position that dared him to turn Boston ' s public housing around from a debt-ridden , crime-infested , and poorly maintained system into an efficiently managed , well-maintained , and rehabilitated operation. // In his last report to Judge Garrity , Spence noted progress in the physical improvements in public housing facilities , in vacancy reduction , in selecting more responsible tenants , and in rent collection . Improvement in management is indicated through training programs , computerization of records , and resolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the schedule for structural improvements . Fair-housing laws are being implemented , albeit slowly . It ' s proved difficult to convince white families to move into projects with a majority of blacks and Hispanics , and to move black families into communities such as Charlestown and South Boston , which have not welcomed blacks in the past. // The semiannual report emphasized the establishment of a BHA police force trained at the state Police Academy , improvement of garbage collection by the city , and improvement of services such as day care , educational programs , and job training. // Holt says tenants approve most changes made under Spence ' s administration , but he adds , ' ' We ' re seeking a tenants ' bill of rights before returning public housing to the BHA. ' ' // No one is saying what the new BHA will be - whether it will return to the old five-member agency or emerge as something different after the receivership is lifted and the city regains control. // ' ' Tenants seek one priority of the BHA - accessibility , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . We want the new BHA to be likewise. ' ' // //
