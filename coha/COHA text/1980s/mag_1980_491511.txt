// DIGGING UP THE PAST Text and Photography by Aaron M. Levin Half a world away , Israel 's upper Galilee is a flat expanse of fertile green . The darker shades of grapefruit and orange trees are set off by broad fields of cotton planted in arrow-straight rows . Flowing tranquilly past the fields and trees and farming villages scattered across the valley floor is the Jordan River , meandering south through history from its source near Mount Hermon down to the Sea of Galilee . Travelers , caravans and armies have passed this way since the time of the patriarch Abraham . The more dramatic episodes are recorded in the Bible or in classical histories or in the annals of the Crusaders , whose crumbling castles punctuate distant hilltops . Here in this valley , while most of us have been reading headlines about current happenings in the Middle East , a group of young Americans has been busy probing the soil in the northernmost part of Israel , searching for the history of a city more than 2,000 years old . Led by Dr. Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan in Ann Arbor , the expedition has dug for the past two summers at Tel Anafa , an ancient settlement in upper Galilee . Forty volunteers joined a dozen professional archaeologists on the excavation , which was cosponsored by the University of Missouri ( whose groups worked on the site from 1968 to 1973 under the direction of Dr. Saul S. Weinberg ) and backed by a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities . " We 're digging to widen our understanding of the connection between East and West in the ancient world , " says Herbert , a short , soft-spoken expert on Greek pottery . " Tel Anafa is especially rich in material from the Hellenistic period , from 330 to 75 B.C. This was the time following the conquests of Alexander the Great , when the Greeks were pushing into the Near East , encountering new cultures . It 's a particularly exciting time in history , but surprisingly little is known about its impact in this part of the world  --  which is why we 're digging here . " Although settlement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic value was demonstrated as recently as 1956 , when Israeli soldiers dug military trenches into the mound . This activity turned up ancient pottery and glass which drew the attention of archaeologists . For a site less than 100 yards long and 40 yards wide , Tel Anafa has produced an impressive quantity of material from the Hellenistic age and the Roman era which followed it . Perhaps the most astonishing find at Tel Anafa has been the enormous quantity of molded glass . Excavations at Athens , for instance , have turned up only four or five pieces of molded glass , a hand-made luxury item which went out of use about 50 B.C. , when glass blowing was invented . Six seasons of digging at Tel Anafa have yielded more than a thousand fragments  --  more than at any other site in the ancient world . In fact , the number of smashed glass drinking vessels has led one archaeologist to refer to the place only half-jokingly as " The Playboy Club of Upper Galilee . " Actually , " Tel Anafa " in modern Hebrew means " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which visit nearby ponds . But since there are no surviving inscriptions to record the city 's ancient name , it remains unknown . Today , Tel Anafa is a gently sloping mound located near the headwaters of the Jordan , along one of the trade routes which ran from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast in antiquity . The site may have been an overnight stop for caravans or the home of some local official . To archaeologists working in the Near East , the word " tel " means a man-made hill built up by successive settlements over centuries . In ancient times , the standard building material was sun-dried mud brick . When buildings collapsed after storms , earthquakes or military assaults , the debris was simply leveled off . New houses or shops were constructed directly on top of the ruins , often burying coins , pots or tools in the rubble . As this process was repeated , the level of the mound rose steadily above the surrounding plain , like some giant layer cake . The lower layers , deposited first , represent earlier periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig backward through time , starting at the top with the most recent cultures and proceeding downward to the ones which came before . The layers in the Tel Anafa " cake " range from the Early Bronze Age ( about 3,000 B.C. ) to traces of A.D. 16th-century Turkish remains . The current excavations concentrate on a period roughly from 250 B.C. to A.D. 100 . This stretch of history in the Holy Land has not received much attention from scholars since it falls mostly into the gap between the Old and New Testaments . While most of the excavators were digging just for their own satisfaction , some , like graduate student Barbara Fiedler of Southfield , Michigan , were getting on-the-job training for careers in archaeology . Fiedler was in charge of a trench on the northern edge of the tel , excavating part of the old city wall . Like each of the five supervisors , she kept careful notes as the digging progressed and a close eye on a crew of hard-working volunteers . It was this group of 40 volunteers , participants in the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual digging , lifting and wheelbarrow-pushing . But , according to Herbert , there 's more to an excavation than learning how to dig a hole neatly . " There 's both an educational value and just plain excitement in the experience of uncovering the past firsthand . Then , too , there 's the satisfaction of piecing together the parts of some historical jigsaw puzzle . Besides , simply living in Israel for a while gives everyone the chance to explore a modern culture different from his or her own . " Herbert defines " students " loosely : " anyone who 's willing to work . " Certainly not all of the volunteers who labored on the dig were of college age . Despite the hard work and hot sun , the expedition has welcomed the efforts of a housewife from San Diego , a recreation professor from Illinois and a 59-year-old machine-tool sales manager from New York City . Still , for undergraduate John Berger of Dearborn Heights , Michigan , the dig was a chance to put his studies into practice . " I was excavating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and sure learned what it meant to be careful . I must have brushed those teeth 30 times a day . " Even excavation director Herbert found an instructive contrast between an intellectual approach to the past and the practical necessities of the present . Only 33 but already a veteran of years of work in Greece and Italy , Herbert still had her hands full running her first dig in Israel . " Foresight is the most important quality an excavation director can have , " she says . " But at the same time you ca n't always be thinking of what can go wrong . You have to make do , adapt to circumstances  --  like hitchhiking to the dig when someone 's gone off with the keys to the pickup . " After patiently negotiating ( without the benefit of a Camp David ) with Israelis for housing , food , transportation , supplies and even water , she compares modern archaeologists to the Hellenistic Greeks who tried  --  not always successfully  --  to impose their own cultural standards wherever they went . The Greeks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " What did the ancients think when the caravan was two days late , " she muses . " I wonder if it was anything like waiting for an overdue bus to pick us up for lunch . " Volunteers had to adapt rapidly to working in the broiling Israeli summer . To avoid as much of the heat as possible , the crew awoke six times a week at 4:30 a.m. with just enough time for a quick cup of strong tea or turkish coffee before taking the bus to the site at 5:00 . Then they dug away at the gray-brown earth of Tel Anafa . At 9:00 a.m. came a welcome break in the shade of an old pistachio tree for a picnic breakfast of tomatoes , cucumbers and hard-boiled eggs . Then more digging until noon , when everyone pitched in for an hour to wash the day 's accumulation of pottery . Not every minute was filled with work , though . People took advantage of free afternoons or Saturdays to swim at the springs of Tel Dan and Banias , the sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruined Crusader fortress of Nimrod Castle . More urbane souls idled away the hours before supper over an iced coffee at sidewalk cafes in Kiryat Shemona , the region 's only city . Although each day 's work produced its trove of antiquities , archaeology at Tel Anafa was no hunt for buried treasure . It was a meticulously planned and scientifically executed search for information about the ancient world . Digging in four-by-four meter squares ( archaeologists use the metric system ) , excavators carefully removed the soil layer by layer , using small hand picks , trowels , whisk brooms and occasionally even dentist 's tools . The depth of each layer of earth was measured , and the remains of walls or floors were photographed and then drawn onto master plans by an architect . As they dug , volunteers looked for traces left behind by townspeople two millenia ago . The material most commonly found was pottery , usually discovered broken into pieces called shards . Many of these shards could be glued back together to form complete pots , which told as much about ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more than 150 coins unearthed at Tel Anafa , stamped with the names and dates of reigning kings , helped to date the levels in which they were found . Large clay wine jars imported from the Greek island of Rhodes link this site to the rest of the Hellenistic world . Special seals were pressed into the handles of each jar by ancient weights and measures inspectors . Because the years of service of these officials are known from other sources , scholars can use the seals to help date other objects found nearby . Besides imported wine ( a luxury even in 100 B.C. ) , there are other signs of wealth at Tel Anafa . Part of a large stone building with ornate gilded decoration has been revealed , possibly a small palace or an elegant inn for travelers . Still , for those who came to Tel Anafa to dig , the most important find was the experience of discovery itself .
