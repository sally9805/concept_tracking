Before he took office in February , South Korean President Roh Tae Woo pledged to leave no " sanctuary " for wrongdoers in the government of his predecessor and mentor , Chun Doo Hwan . Roh is proving true to his word . Last week Chun 's younger brother , Chun Kyung Hwan , 45 , was arrested for tax evasion , influence peddling , and embezzling at least $8.7 million from the semiofficial Saemaul Undong movement , a national development organization he headed for seven years . <P> The arrest may backfire on Roh . Opposition politicians have seized on the scandal as evidence of how corruption went unpunished during the Chun years . The case has also reminded voters that as Home Minister from 1982 to 1983 , Roh was responsible for overseeing Saemaul.
