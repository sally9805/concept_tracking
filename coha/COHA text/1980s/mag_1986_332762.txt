" This is Len Bias . . . There 's no way he can die . Seriously , sir , please come quick . " That was Brian Tribble 's desperate plea to a 911 operator as his friend , University of Maryland Basketball Star Len Bias , lay dying of cocaine intoxication in his dormitory on June 19 . Last week Tribble surrendered to authorities after a grand jury indicted him on narcotics charges that included possession of cocaine with intent to distribute the drug . Tribble , 24 , a former Maryland junior-varsity basketball player , is suspected of providing Bias with the coke that killed him . <P> Also indicted were two teammates of Bias ' who were with the athlete when he collapsed : Terry Long , 22 , and David Gregg , 20 . They are accused of cocaine possession and obstruction of justice , a charge stemming from authorities ' contention that the players removed drug paraphernalia from the dorm before investigators arrived .                   @ @
