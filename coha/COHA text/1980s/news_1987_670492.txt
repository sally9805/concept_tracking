They are the people , from high party and Government officials to farmers and laborers , who oppose the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev , whose politics are more open than those of his predecessors. // How serious a threat they pose to his programs , and ultimately to his political power , is not entirely clear , but Mr. Gorbachev has felt increasingly compelled in recent weeks to address their concerns. // In a speech Wednesday that offered his most candid public commentary on the opposition , he took the unusual and somewhat defensive step of reassuring the country that he would not plunge the Soviet Union into social turmoil. // In doing so and in confirming that a key party meeting in January was postponed three times because of disagreement , Mr. Gorbachev has given the outside world a rare , if still somewhat opaque , view of a Soviet leader struggling to build and sustain a campaign for change against entrenched interests . <> <> More of Burden Than Threat // Most Western diplomats and Soviet officials agree that the opposition , for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gorbachev. // They said the people and institutions that he has alienated are resisting his policies but lack an alternative program and do not constitute a coherent opposition movement . Nor has another political figure emerged in the party leadership to challenge Mr. Gorbachev ' s position and provide a rallying point for opponents , they say. // That could change , and Western analysts here have started hedging their bets a bit about Mr. Gorbachev ' s long-term political survival. // Mr. Gorbachev appears to be able to command a clear majority of support in the Politburo , which makes policy , and in the Secretariat , which carries it out , according to Western diplomats and Soviet officials. // They said he still faced sizable pockets of resistance in the Central Committee , with more widespread resistance down through the middle and lower levels of the Communist Party and Government . <> <> Increasing Demands Feared // Most analysts said the opposition consisted of people whose power and privileges were under attack , whose customary way of doing business was being challenged and who were nervous that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater tolerence for dissent , might unleash ever-increasing demands for more freedom. // Arthur A. Hartman , until recently the American Ambassador here , said before his departure this month : " Power is in the hands of the top party bureaucrats , and these people are hanging on for dear life to the power and privileges they ' ve gotten. " // Mr. Gorbachev said Wednesday that those who question " the expediency of further democratization " fear that " it will be used by our people to disorganize society and undermine discipline , to undermine the strength of the system. " // Rejecting that view , he said : " Democracy is not the opposite of order . Democracy is not the opposite of discipline . Democracy is not the antithesis of responsibility . " <> <> Many Russians Alarmed // While Mr. Gorbachev ' s vision of democracy , including a call for more competitive elections , bears little resemblance to the Jeffersonian concept , it has alarmed many Soviet officials and citizens. // " Do we not tend to gloss over the sharpness and depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? " Aleksandr Bovin , a political commentator , wrote last month after the contested party session , a meeting of the Central Committee. // Mr. Gorbachev , the party ' s General Secretary , said at that meeting , " There are quite a few people who are slow to throw off the burden of the past. " // Occasionally , the opposition is identified . Two key Gorbachev rivals on the Politburo , Grigory V. Romanov and Viktor V. Grishin , were forced to retire , and many other holdovers from the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev have left the body . Almost the entire leadership of the Secretariat has been replaced by Mr. Gorbachev , as have dozens of Government ministers . <> <> Individual Agencies Criticized // Individual ministries and state committees have been the target of criticism . Mr. Gorbachev complained Wednesday about failures in the metallurgical , chemical and electronic industries. // At a meeting of writers in June , he castigated Gosplan , the state planning committee , saying that as far as the agency was concerned " there is no authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Its officials do whatever they want , " he added. // But more often Mr. Gorbachev and others talk in general about the opposition . Gennadi I. Gerasimov , the Foreign Ministry spokesman , when asked at a news conference Thursday about the extent of the opposition , replied , " The opposition that exists is not in the Politburo. " // " This is a struggle between the old and the new , and the new is going to win , " he said. // Georgi A. Arbatov , the director of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute , said in a recent interview , " The resistance to Gorbachev is misunderstood in the West as organized opposition . " <> <> Three Categories of Opposition // He said the resistance really fell into three categories. // " There is the force of inertia , millions of people , not a majority but a substantial minority , who don ' t want to sweat , who don ' t want to work any harder , " he said. // The second layer , Mr. Arbatov said , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , workers , plant managers and others whose jobs have become redundant. // Mr. Gorbachev mentioned another source of discontent on Wednesday when he said the goals he has championed and the promises he has made had created " a revolution of expectations. " // " Many want a speedy social and material return , " he said. // The economy has so far been slow to deliver on his pledges of improved consumer goods and services , increased supplies of meat and fresh vegetables , improved working conditions and more flexible incentives. //
