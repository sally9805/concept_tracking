Automen meet with the President as sales continue to sink <P> It looked like a trustbuster 's dream . Last Wednesday the top executives of General Motors , Ford , Chrysler , American Motors and Volkswagen of America all sat down at the same table in the Washington offices of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association for a lunch of asparagus vinaigrette and tomatoes stuffed with chicken salad . But the automen were not fixing prices ; they were coordinating strategy for a meeting just after lunch with one of the industry 's most powerful critics , Jimmy Carter . <P> The President had asked them to the White House at the urging of Transportation Secretary Neil Goldschmidt , who has been studying the industry for the past six months as part of the Federal Government 's loan guarantee to Chrysler . Goldschmidt 's investigation convinced him that the auto manufacturers were in very deep trouble , even discounting the woes of a recession downturn . Two weeks ago , Goldschmidt gave the President a 20-minute graph and chart show to demonstrate the seriousness of Detroit 's plight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carmakers and United Auto Workers President Douglas Fraser . While no specific action came out of the White House gathering , the fact that it was held could be the first sign of an intensified Administration effort to help Detroit . <P> The American auto problem is simply that customers are not buying the products that the U.S. turns out . The day the automen descended on Washington , new sales figures for the first ten days in May showed a staggering 42% decline from levels of a year earlier . And last May 's figures had already been distressingly low . The plunge put the industry at the lowest sales level of any ten-day period in 22 years and represented an annual selling rate of only 5 million cars . Just two years ago , Detroit sold more than 9 million ( the record : 9.7 million in 1973 ) . More than a third of the Big Three 's 750,000 workers are already idle . And by the end of the year , a total of eleven manufacturing and assembly plants will be shuttered . <P> To try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinstituted rebates . Chrysler is mailing checks for as much as $1,000 to buyers of its ' 79 four-wheel-drive models , and Ford is offering up to $500 on big Fords , Lincolns and Mercurys . <P> For last week 's meeting , Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and President J. Paul Bergmoser were driven up to the White House 's northwest gate in a wine-red , four-door Dodge Omni ( 24 m.p.g. city and 31 m.p.g. highway ) . They not only dramatized their company 's commitment to small cars but successfully upstaged their GM and Ford colleagues , who arrived in larger , albeit " down-sized , " Pontiac and Lincoln cars . Right behind Iacocca came the United Auto Workers ' Fraser in a compact , light blue Plymouth Horizon , with the $7,200 sticker price still on the window .
