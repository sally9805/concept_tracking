This week 's cover stories on " good " cholesterol nearly created a crisis in the home of senior writer David Brand , who wrote both the main story and the accompanying article on nutrition . Brand became so intrigued by the topic that he began to analyze the cholesterol content of all the meals his family ate . " That nearly drove my daughters Leslie and Robyn crazy , " he recalls . " They accused me of ruining every meal and wanted to ban the subject altogether . " Never an autocrat at the table , Brand capitulated in the interest of domestic peace . <P> A native of Kent , in the southeast of England , Brand has shown a similar fascination with new topics throughout his career . As a teenager he wandered through much of Europe , ultimately setting out for the New World , where he worked as a reporter in Montreal . Later he earned a B.A. from New York University . For 16 years , Brand worked at the Wall Street Journal , where as a science reporter he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Award for stories on protein research and artificial intelligence . After a few years of helping edit the paper 's front page , he went to London as a Journal correspondent . Among his assignments was a visit to Siberia to report on Soviet science . He joined TIME as a senior editor in 1983 , where one of his first duties was editing a cover article on the dangers of cholesterol . Eighteen months ago , Brand returned to his first love , writing , and has since applied his curiosity to such subjects as Asian-American students , the environment and the hospice movement . In preparation for this week 's stories , Brand so immersed himself in the subject that he even had his own cholesterol count checked . He was relieved to find it was 170 , well within the low-risk range . But that should have come as no surprise . A self-described " food fanatic , " Brand avoids cholesterol-rich dishes and relaxes by preparing Chinese meals that are low in saturated fats . He credits his diet sense to the influence of his wife Sandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef . In normal times , though , the Brands seldom discuss nutrition at the table , especially when their daughters are eating at home .
