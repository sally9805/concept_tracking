Newswatch / Thomas Griffith <P> It is not yet clear whether the Carter briefing papers are a molehill waiting to be made into a mountain or a mountain trying to pass itself off as a molehill . Although the story has so far claimed no victims in the Reagan Administration , it has dealt a glancing blow to a bright star of the Washington press corps , George F. Will , the conservative columnist , and raised anew the question of how cozy journalists should be with politicians . <P> In a Washington Journalism Review poll last month , Will was voted the journalist most admired by Senators , Congressmen and their staffs . His column appears in more than 400 papers . He has never really been a reporter , but on ABC 's This Week with David Brinkley , he has proved to be a cool , intense , intimidating interviewer . A private person , he was never one to dine out on the fact that President-elect Reagan and Nancy came to dinner at his house , or that the President asked him to draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first Will did n't understand what all the fuss was about when word got out that he had known from the beginning that the Reagan people had Carter 's briefing book , and that he had helped prepare Reagan for the Carter debate at a mock rehearsal ( William Safire , similarly invited , declined ) . Once before , when Will 's professional conduct had been criticized , he complained with baroque condescension that journalism is " now infested with persons who are little moral thermometers ' . . . spreading a silly scrupulosity . " That sort of putdown did n't work this time . <P> What most angered Will 's colleagues was that Will , on ABC 's Nightline after the debate , had acclaimed Reagan 's " Thoroughbred performance . " In awarding Reagan the victory , the New Republic commented , Will " posed as a referee without ever making it clear that he had been one of the seconds . " The New York Daily News , calling this unethical behavior , dropped Will 's column in such haste as to prompt the suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers all along . <P> On Martin Agronsky 's roundtable TV program , Will heard his colleagues James J. Kilpatrick and Carl Rowan chide him . The following day , on the Brinkley broadcast , he had to take it again . ( ABC was particularly anxious to clear its own skirts . ) Will , a man of enormous self-confidence , appeared a bit chastened . He told Brinkley that the President , after watching the Agronsky show , had called Will to belittle the " peculiar " idea " that I need people like you to tell me how to go out in public and debate the basic issues of the day . " Will 's own defense is that as a commentator hired for his opinions , which are hardly a secret , he deserves to be judged differently from " the straight news reporter . " <P> Will has a point , but not enough of one . To the public he is now a conspicuous member of the press , and no longer just a polemicist . In a long column in the Washington Post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done , but would not do it again . The Post considered that a satisfactory apology , a word Will did not use .
