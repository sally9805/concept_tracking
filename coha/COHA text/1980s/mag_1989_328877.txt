The Batman summer superhype has caught up with Las Cruces police chief Ron Axtell . Warner Communications demanded that the city stop using the Batman , logo on its ambulance-like BATmobile . The vehicle is used to catch drunk drivers , and its popularized name really stands for the breath alcohol-testing unit . <P> Axtell did not mind losing his BATmobile . " I 'm sure it 's not going to affect our arrests , " he said . " The people we put in it probably do n't even know there 's a bat on it , they 're so drunk . " <P> But Axtell was no joker . He cut a deal and got Warner to donate an official Batman jacket as a prize in a city-wide contest to come up with a new name for the five-year-old program . <P> It 's all more hype for a batty summer .
