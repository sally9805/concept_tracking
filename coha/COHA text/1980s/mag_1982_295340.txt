Realism overcomes ideology <P> You could almost hear the sigh of relief here , " said a top executive of France 's Rhone-Poulenc chemical and fiber conglomerate . Applauded the conservative Paris daily Le Figaro : " It seems that realism has finally overcome ideology . " Even Pierre Charpy , a spokesman for the opposition Rally for the Republic Party , conceded that the long-dreaded move by the Socialist government of President Francois Mitterrand was " not a scandal . " <P> All that exhaling followed the government 's formal takeover last week of Rhone-Poulenc and four other industrial groups , with total 1980 sales of $46 billion , plus 23 banking and financial institutions , and the appointment of 27 men and one woman to head the nationalized firms . Yet those captains of socialist industry looked much like their capitalist predecessors . In fact , at two firms , they were the very same faces , and at most of the others they might as well have been . <P> Dispelling fears that it would plop a band of radical political commissars into the directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of experienced economists , bankers and industrialists . The news was so reassuring to the country 's jittery business and financial Establishment that stock values on the Paris Bourse rose by a full percentage point following the announcement . <P> Among the nationalized firms ' chief executives : <P> &gt; Alain Gomez , 43 , a graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration ( E.N.A. ) and onetime Harvard Business School student , who will lead Thomson-Brandt , an electronics and home appliance firm . A founder of the Socialist Party 's vocal left wing , Gomez is probably the most ideological of the appointees . But his training and twelve years ' experience as an executive at the newly nationalized **27;9029;TOOLONG , a diversified glassmaker , give him impeccable business credentials . <P> &gt; Jean-Pierre Brunet , 62 , a respected economist and former ambassador to Japan and West Germany , who will head the electronics giant Compagnie Generale d'Electricit . <P> &gt; Michel de Boissieu , 64 , an E.N.A . graduate and a veteran government official , who will take over as head of the Banque Rothschild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> &gt; Jean Gandois , 51 , who will retain his job as president of Rhone-Poulenc . An experienced industrialist and champion of free enterprise , Gandois had been singled out by France 's powerful labor unions as a prime target for sacking because of his job-threatening efforts to phase out unproductive textile plants . That Mitterrand kept Gandois is a clear sign that the unions will not have a free hand in running what some pundits are starting to call " France , Inc . " <P> Nor did the government seem eager to impose its own rule over the newly nationalized enterprises . As Mitterrand himself said last week , " These firms and banks should not be appendices of the government . Their autonomy to make decisions and act must be total . " The state 's role , explained Industry Secretary Pierre Dreyfus , is " to operate as a catalyst for industry , to spur investment and innovation , to oversee the trend of industrial evolution for France .
