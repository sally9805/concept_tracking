The campaign to take the sex and violence out of television <P> Television is the most widely shared experience in this diffuse country . That alone would make it a natural target for zealots of the New Right , intent on proving their political muscle . TV , moreover , is omnipresent in home and family life , and Christian conservatives see the family as endangered . They contend that TV reflects-indeed , often promotes-the gratuitous sex , profanity and violence of contemporary society , thus bringing moral decay into the home . <P> The Coalition for Better Television ( CBTV ) , which claims to represent 400 conservative organizations , including the Rev. Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority , has been threatening to attack network TV 's Achilles ' heel by a consumer boycott of its skittish sponsors . The head of CBTV is the Rev. Donald Wildmon , a Methodist preacher from Mississippi , who for the past four years has been monitoring TV as founder of one of the coalition 's member groups , the National Federation for Decency . Relying on a new list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put together from a survey made by 4,000 " trained monitors " between March and May , Wildmon may now ask consumers to reject the products of companies that most consistently advertised on shows featuring sex and violence . The coalition claimed that 5 million Americans were already committed to participate in the boycott and that 15 million more sympathizers could be solicited by direct mail and newspaper advertising . <P> There is reason to doubt that such a boycott could succeed . But the would-be censors appear to be winning the war before the battle begins . Already the networks are sounding defensive , warning that if sex is successfully restrained , censorship of news and opinion will follow . Civil libertarians are readying a $2 million countercampaign in support of diversity , called People for the American Way and featuring TV public-service ads produced by Norman Lear , creator of All in the Family . ( Moral Majority has announced that Falwell will demand reply time whenever a Lear ad appears . ) Most important , advertisers are uneasy . Chairman Owen Butler of Procter &; Gamble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ) , announced in mid-June that within the past year his company had pulled out of 50 TV movies and series episodes , including seven of the ten series that Wildmon has cited as " top sex-oriented. " * Last week representatives of at least four companies-including Warner-Lambert , SmithKline , Gillette and Phillips Petroleum-conferred privately with CBTV , some in apparent hope that Wildmon would excuse them from the boycott hit list if they would go and sin no more . Wildmon in turn announced : " I think consultation and conversation and compromise are far superior to confrontation . We 've always said that a boycott is a last resort . " Exulted Cal Thomas , vice president of communications for the Moral Majority : " It 's like the prime rate . When No. 1 announces , a lot of others follow . The response we 've gotten from advertisers since the Procter &; Gamble speech has been very gratifying . "
