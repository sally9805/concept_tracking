These findings stand in sharp contrast to the situation that the women ' s colleges faced 10 years ago and to the predictions that they could not survive . Their end seemed at hand , at the time when most formerly all-male colleges began to admit women. // Most of the 118 women ' s colleges had , after all , been founded in the 19th century to give young women a chance to go to college when the majority of campuses were reserved exclusively for men . Why would young women today , in the wake of the sexual as well as the feminist revolution , choose any longer to spend their undergraduate years in all-female isolation ? // The report , " A Study of the Learning Environment at Women ' s Colleges , " undertaken by The Women ' s College Coalition , a nonprofit advocacy group , and supported by the Ford Foundation , tries to answer that question . It cites women ' s college presidents and faculty members who describe their mission as " providing a supportive atmosphere for women , encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fight stereotypes . " Their students are more likely to major in areas that traditionally have not attracted women , such as science and mathematics. // While most of the former all-male institutions that have gone coed are still run by a preponderance of men , the study shows that in women ' s colleges " women are present in significant proportions throughout the power , reward and prestige systems . " For example , 51 percent of the tenured faculty and 71 percent of the presidents are women. // Perhaps most significant , almost half of all the women ' s college trustees are women , while women remain a tiny minority on all other college and university governing boards . Commenting on why change has come so slowly , Dr. Martha Church , president of Hood College in Frederick , Md. , who presided over data collection for the study , said , " Sixty-year-old gentlemen see men as safer bets. " // At women ' s colleges , the study found , faculty members , men as well as women , " are significantly involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For example , 84 percent of the faculty members who responded reported that in the last year they had added such material to their courses. // Other findings include these : // - More than 90 percent of the presidents agreed that women ' s colleges inherently recognize the contributions and concerns of women in more subtle ways than through separate women ' s studies. // - Of the presidents , 81 percent believe that male faculty members at women ' s colleges are more likely to develop an affirmative attitude toward women ' s intellectual abilities than those at coeducational colleges. // - Of the faculty , 80 percent of the women and 73 percent of the men considered it their mission and that of the colleges to raise women ' s aspirations ; 75 percent of the women and 66 percent of the men want to develop assertiveness , ambition and leadership in their students ; 72 percent of the women and 66 percent of the men want to make their students aware of the full range of roles and opportunities open to women. // Susan Nall Bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly favorable enrollment statistics . From 1970 to 1974 , she said , it was downhill all the way . A reversal began in 1975 , and in the five years that followed , until the current academic year , " it ' s all uphill . " Despite the five-year decline at the beginning of the decade , the full-time enrollment at the 113 colleges covered by the study had risen 5. 5 percent by 1980 . With part-time enrollment up 151 percent , the decade ' s total growth was 15 percent. // Asked to explain that comeback , Miss Bales said that by 1974 most of the high-prestige formerly all-male campuses had gone coed , but " reports started to come out of them that their coeducation was often still not coequal. " // By 1975 , she said , society had changed . The First Women ' s Bank had been chartered . It had become respectable , and for many activist women even desirable , " to do things together as women , " not as a substitute for , or in imitation of , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in the past. // The women ' s movement , Miss Bales said , for the first time became associated with women ' s colleges , and " was no longer an embarrassment . " Many activists were women ' s college graduates , among them Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan and that admired role model , Margaret Mead. // Today , Miss Bales believes , there is no longer any question about the women ' s colleges ' survival as an option for young women . The vital question for these colleges now is how they can best export to the coeducational campuses those special qualities beneficial to women . She finds that " women ' s colleges are producing achievers out of proportion to their size. " // Miss Bales herself did not attend a women ' s college . She graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles , and did advanced work at Middlebury College and the Sorbonne . " For me , the coalition has been a tremendous eye-opener , " she said . " At U.C.L.A. , I had one woman professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve become a convert. " // Would she want a daughter to go to a women ' s college ? " Definitely , " she said . . Women ' s colleges today are places where women truly can explore any field , where both the best and the worst students are women. " // She sums up the report as saying that women ' s colleges have been responsive to women ' s changing life styles . They understand their responsibility to hire women and to " put women in the curriculum so that courses in Western civilization aren ' t just a history of wars. " // Having survived , Miss Bales concludes , women ' s colleges in the years ahead are likely to be useful in helping coed campuses to deal with an expected influx of more women students. // ( Copies of the study may be obtained for $15 from the Women ' s College Coalition , 1725 K Street , N.W.
