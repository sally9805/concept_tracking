" A field without grass is an eyesore , " wrote the Roman poet Ovid , " so is a tree without leaves , so is a head without hair . " For centuries , bald and balding men have winced at such unkind references to their predicament . Conditioned to regard hairlessness as a male curse second only to impotence , they have historically taken drastic measures to undo their baldness . Some have pretended to own hair , bewigging their shining pates with nylon or natural locks ; others have recycled what little thatching they have left , combing a few camouflaging strands across their brows or having " plugs " transplanted from one part of the head to another . Still others have poured their hopes into the creams and tonics of quacksalvers , seeking the ever elusive miracle cure for the androgenic alopecia  --  male-pattern baldness  --  that plagued them . <P> Hope may , at last , be where the head is . Last week the Food and Drug Administration approved a prescription medicine that increases hair growth in some men whose hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Upjohn Co. under the trade name Rogaine , it is the first product ever cleared by federal regulators for treating hair loss . Its key ingredient : minoxidil , a highly touted drug that , in tablet form , had already been approved to treat high blood pressure . Only by accident did researchers discover that minoxidil could also regrow hair . Anticipating a vast new market for the drug , Upjohn developed a liquid version and began testing it on bald heads . After twelve months , 39% of the men tested had moderate-to-dense hair growth on their crowns ; 61% showed no growth at all . <P> Although the FDA action marks the first time the drug has been recognized as a baldness treatment , many doctors have already been prescribing it for their hair-impaired patients . Rogaine does not work equally for everyone , however . Best candidates : men under 40 who have been balding on the crown for ten years or less and who have a moderate amount of hair left . For some reason , the drug does not seem to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School , who chaired the FDA panel : " The most important thing is to have fuzzy hair left  --  fine , light hairs . " <P> Rogaine treatment requires perseverance : the lotion must be applied twice a day for four to six months just to see if it will work . Cost : up to $400 . Says Stern : " The chances of substantial results are only one in five , a large investment for a reasonably low chance of real cosmetic benefit . " Moreover , if the applications are discontinued , the new hair disappears within a few months and balding continues at its previous pace . Says New York Dermatologist Stephen Kurtin : " The biggest resistance to minoxidil is not that the results may be only fair , but that it is a lifetime commitment . " <P> While minoxidil appears to be safe , the FDA advises patients to get a thorough physical before taking it and then see their doctors periodically . One reason : those who have cardiovascular disease and who also absorb the drug more easily than others may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects . None of the test subjects have suffered such serious problems , however , although some have developed such minor complaints as itching , scaling and blistering of the scalp .
