txt If the skies are clear over Williamsburg this weekend , It would be nice if a skywriter could fix the attention of the seven heads of state by puffing out this message : " You ca n't change the terms of trade by changing the unit of account . " Granted there would be a lot of head scratching . But eventually economists would come forward to Interpret this message writ large . In simplest terms , If a loaf of bread trades for a bottle of wine , these are the terms of trade . In a modern economy , especially to facilitate banking , transactors convert all production to a common " unit of account . " In the U.S. , the unit of account is the dollar . Thus , if one loaf equals SI and one bottle equals SI , the terms of trade are one loaf for one bottle at one unit . The message In the Williamsburg sky simply states that if the government that controls the unit of account In this case changes it to two units , the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still swap a loaf for a bottle . For centuries governments generally accepted the idea that it was best to fix the value of their unit of account , that no good could come from changing It . But In early 1971 , the Idea took hold in the U.S. that we could enrich ourselves by changing the terms of International trade simply by changing the unit of account . The idea was sold to U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally that the U.S. dollar had become " overvalued " relative to the Japanese yen and the German mark , and If we could only devalue it by a significant amount , roughly 13% , our goods would become cheaper and we 'd sell more abroad , and their goods would become more expensive and we 'd buy less of them . The leading proponents of this notion were the Yale Keynesians . But American Industrialists loved the idea ; we would sell more steel and autos and the Japanese and Germans would be put In their place . Under the terms of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars to yen , marks or any other currency . Instead , it would maintain the ratio of its unit of account , the dollar , to a specified weight of gold . $35 to the ounce . In order to devalue the dollar and harvest these trading gains at the expense of our trading partners , we would have to make the dollar worth less in terms of gold or they would have to make their currencies worth more In terms of gold . On Aug. 15 , 1971 , the U.S. surprised the world by suspending Its commitment to $35 per ounce of gold ( closing the " gold window " ) . And In December of that year , President Nixon announced a realignment of the CUP currencies , with the dollar devalued to $42.50 per ounce of gold . Concurrently , the yen and mark were appreciated In terms of gold . Policy makers waited in vain for the promised benefits to roll in . As the supplyside economists at the time warned , all we could expect was a rise in the general price level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 35 bottles when the unit is one , the terms remain the same when the unit Is one-plus . The most serious thing that happens when the government devalues its unit of account , though , Is to reward people who had borrowed dollars before the devaluaBon at the expense of their creditors . To protect themselves , lenders must raise interest rates . The link between effort and reward is weakened as one class of citizens enjoys a windfall gain and the other class a windfall loss . And society must divert some of its most talented people away from producing goods and Into financial speculations , to protect private wealth against further capricious government changes In the value of its unit of ac ? count . In the spring of 1973 , an Inflation erupted that only the supply-siders had predicted . Others were wrong . " What we are observing currently . " said Man Greenspan in Barron 's on Feb. 5 , 1973 , " may well turn out to be a more fundamental disinflationary trend . " By March , the U.S. gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Treasury Secretory George Shultz listening to his Chicago monetarist friends , the U.S. dollar was " floated " against the value of gold and other currencies . " Flexible exchange rates , " wrote Milton Friedman in News ? week of Dec. 20 , 1971 , " are more sta. bid " In practice , though , the floating dollar proved to be not stable at all . to the dec ? ade since the dollar officially floated , the price of gold has zoomed as high as 9850 and nose dived to below $300 , pulling cornmodity prices up and down In successive waves of inflations and deflations . And as the dollar/yen , dollar/mark , dollar/ pound exchange rates roller-coasted , somehow the promised benefits In our terms of trade never materialized for our industrialists . The political effects of this great experiment have been profound . With the dollar fixed in value by law , It is essentially depoliticized . As the dollar floats in value , debtors and creditors have a vested Interest In the management of the currency . Democrats as a rule tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalize easy money or devaluation policies that offer debtor relief . The Republican Party is weighted with creditor Interests and their economists tend to advocate policies of deflation that reward creditors at the expense of debtors . The trouble Is , the greater the Inflation the less willing is the creditor class to lend . The greater the deflation , the less able the debtor class is to repay , and the greater the number of bankruptcies . Coalitions form favoring debtors and inflation , then reform to favor creditors . Political power swings back and forth between the two parties . A deflationist William Simon at Treasury is replaced by a Michael Blumenthal who " talks down the dollar " who is eventually followed by a deflationist Donald Regan . The cycle of one-term presidents may now be broken because the chairman of the Federal Reserve , Paul Volcker , last summer broke with the deflationary monetarist policies the White House had been pressing on him . Mr. Volcker was undersecretary of the Treasury in 1973 and supported a return to a fixed value to the dol. lar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by advocating Treasury intervention in the currency markets to stabilize exchange rates . The president 's aides , though , seem eager to replace him with Alan Greenspan . a deflationist at all times . President Reagan has a great opportunity at Williamsburg to begin the process of restoring the dollar as an International unit of account in a way that avoids both destabilizing Inflations and deflations He would have no resistance from America 's trading partners , who have been whip lashed by our erratic dollar policies this past decade . Helmut Schmidt , former chancellor of West Germany and coauthor of the " floatIiig " exchange rate system in 1973 with George Shultz and France 's Valery GIscant d'Estaing , now publicly acknowledges the failure of the experiment . So does Henry Kissinger . French President Francois Mitterrand is pressing for a new Bretton Woods . There is nothing to lose . liy giving up our sovereignty over manipulation of the dollar and fixing Its value to a standard as we had for 200 years , the U.S. would slutply reassert its global leadership In maintaining a reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to take this lead is the chance that we could still somehow change the terms of trade by changing the unit of account . Hut we ca n't and there 's no sense in trying again and again . Mr. Wanntslit Is prrsulent rJ Pohrono ? mica Inc. , of Morristown , N.J.
