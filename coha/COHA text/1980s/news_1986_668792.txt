Dennis Gentry is getting his quickness back , which will come as a surprise to the Atlanta Falcons . At least , that ' s what the Bears hope . " Something happens when he ' s around , " said coach Mike Ditka . The Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers  --  the Bears ' last two opponents  --  might be surprised to know Gentry is still recovering from a sore Achilles heel that has slowed him since the third game of the season in Green Bay . Typically , Gentry has said little . He missed only one game before returning to action . But he has run the ball only three times from scrimmage and caught only five passes in the six games since . Against the Rams , however , Gentry broke a kickoff return 84 yards to set up a touchdown . Against the Buccaneers , he made a terrific leaping catch and ran for a 37-yard gain just before halftime . Gentry has only nine kickoff returns this year , yet teams are kicking away from him . His whopping 38. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league leaders . But nine attempts aren ' t enough for him to qualify . He is a . 600 hitter who gets too many intentional walks to win the batting crown . The Bears are not alarmed when opponents kick away from Gentry , because the alternative is Thomas Sanders . " Also , sometimes when they try to kick away from Gentry , they wind up kicking short and we get good field position , " Ditka said . Gentry and Sanders tried to stack themselves in the middle of the goal line to force Tampa Bay to guess which way to kick . " But if you wait too long to pick a side , you end up catching the ball running sideways , " Gentry said . " You want to always catch it running upfield . If you wait , they ' ll start kicking to the corner and you might step out of bounds . " To qualify for the list of league leaders , a kick returner needs to average 1 1/4 returns a game or 20 a year . Gentry would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number for him to reach . Pro Bowl voters , please note . " He ' s moaning and complaining that he doesn ' t have enough attempts , " Roland said . Ditka said Gentry will alternate series at flanker with Keith Ortego and also continue to play in the third-down offense as a wide receiver-running back . " He gets double coverage and leaves Keith open when he ' s in there on third down , " Roland said . Gentry is in a Catch-22 situation with the Bears . Although he is perhaps their most explosive offensive weapon , he plays in situations the Bears would rather avoid . If a team is fielding too many kickoffs , they are giving up too many points . If they are facing too many third-down situations , they aren ' t getting the job done earlier . The way opponents seem to look at Gentry , they would rather not score than kick to him .
