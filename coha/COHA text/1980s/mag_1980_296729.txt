A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES <P> by John Kennedy Toole <P> Louisiana State University <P> Press 338 pages ; $12.95 <P> Into each literary life some unsolicited manuscripts must fall , and fall and fall and fall . They are almost never any good . Established authors , editors , critics and agents read them glumly , but with a touch of the spirit that moves others to buy lottery tickets . The big payoff may be ridiculously unlikely , but the lure is irresistible . Novelist Walker Percy was handed an improbable winning number in 1976 . A teaching stint in New Orleans left him vulnerable to would-be writers . One day a bulky manuscript was thrust upon him by a middle-aged woman wearing white gloves and accompanied by a chauffeur . She firmly advised Percy to read the " great book " her son had written . Seeing no gentlemanly way out , he began to riffle pages and then to read slowly . Before long , he decided that A Confederacy of Dunces was " a great rumbling farce " that had to be published . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the story of its author does not . John Kennedy Toole was born in New Orleans in 1937 . He graduated from high school at 16 and then from Tulane in 1958 . He received a master 's degree in English from Columbia a year later , taught for a year in New York City and then returned to Louisiana . He served two years in the Army , chiefly based in Puerto Rico , where he wrote his novel . He went back to New Orleans to teach and to find a publisher . Years passed with no success . As his frustrations continued , Toole grew increasingly withdrawn . He was found asphyxiated in his car in 1969 . <P> In his posthumous exuberant comic novel , laughter prevails . Ignatius J. Reilly , 30 , is a monumental slob whose mere appearance on the streets of New Orleans makes policemen itch to arrest him . <P> " To think , " one character tells him , " that they 're letting you run around loose .

His heart belongs to the early Middle Ages . <P> He thinks that contemporary domestic life would be improved if chains and manacles were put back in the home , where they belong : " When father came in from work , the whole family could grab him and chain him for being stupid enough to be working all day long to support them . " <P> Unfortunately for Ignatius , his dipsomaniacal mother forces him to look for a 20th century job . He first fetches up at Levy Pants , a somnolent factory with a senile secretary named Miss Trixie . " Am I retired ? " she asks often . Ignatius tries to organize the black workers into an ill-fated Crusade for Moorish Dignity . Then he takes up selling hot dogs in the French Quarter . His mother comes to the belated conclusion that Ignatius is disgracing her and wonders about committing him to Charity Hospital .
