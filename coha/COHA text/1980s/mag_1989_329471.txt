One of the most maddening  --  and frightening  --  aspects of the AIDS epidemic is that no one knows how many people have been infected with the deadly virus . It can lie dormant in the body for years before producing symptoms . U.S. health officials have estimated that between 950,000 and 1.45 million Americans have picked up the virus , but that is based on spotty data . Admits a federal AIDS expert : " It 's just hard to take those numbers seriously . " <P> But now there is a set of numbers that may deserve to be taken seriously . Joel Hay , a health economist for the Hoover Institution at Stanford , has used a statistical tool called " back calculation " to analyze data on AIDS infections . His surprising conclusion : about 640,000 Americans carry the virus . If he is right , the epidemic , while still devastating , may be only half as widespread as generally believed . <P> Hay 's calculation is based on the observation that in a specific group of people carrying the AIDS virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . For example , it appears that roughly 6% will come down with the disease in the second year after infection . Since the Government has accurate figures on how many people have developed AIDS , Hay was able to work backward to figure out the number of those who carry the virus . <P> The economist uses his techniques to predict the rate at which new AIDS cases will be reported , and his projections seem to be on target . Says a Government scientist : " Every month Hay 's numbers look better and better , while the official estimates look worse . " <P> AIDS activists doubt Hay 's figures and fear that they could cause the nation to become less concerned about the disease . The critics think that the use of anti-AIDS drugs has delayed the onset of symptoms in many people and thus made the economist 's calculations erroneous . <P> The Government may settle the issue with a national AIDS survey , which began last week in Dallas . The residents of 3,400 households were sent letters asking them to take anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug use . Some AIDS groups protested , charging that the money used for the survey could be better spent on treatment and the search for a cure .
