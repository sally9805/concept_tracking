This story is a composite of versions published in various editions . She has the face of an angel , the body of Jamie Lee Curtis , the IQ of a lettuce leaf , but she ' s a real doll . Long before Vanna White , there was Barbie . In 1959 she sprang full-blown from the minds at Mattel Inc. and has been ringing cash registers , somewhere in the world , every two seconds ever since . She can still pass for 21 , but Barbie officially joined the " thirtysomething " generation Monday night , and 700 guests made merry at a black-tie gala in honor of her " pink jubilee . " Swagged in bubble-gum toned silk , the State Theater at Lincoln Center bulged with toymakers , many in town for the Toy Fair . Bedecked with pink rosebud wrist corsages and boutonnieres , they danced to a rock band , were serenaded by a prepubescent rock group , and somewhat bashfully lined up to have their pictures taken with a lifesized cutout of the guest of honor . Served by waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink food from blush-toned Perrier and pink champagne to rosy roast beef and petit fours frosted with pink B ' s . " Barbie ' s my inspiration . She has almost as many pretty dresses as I do , " quipped singer Melba Moore , who would have a hard time topping Barbie ' s lifetime wardrobe of about 250 million outfits not to mention her 1. 2 million pairs of shoes . With more than 500 million sold , the bridal gown is the perennial best seller , but odds are Barbie will never officially wear it . " I don ' t think so , " said Mattel chairman John Amerman , shaking his head , " I don ' t think we want to do that . " Indeed , with nearly 500 million Barbie dolls sold to date , including 20 million last year at an average of $10 each , Amerman is clearly reluctant to tamper with a good thing . Through it all , the good-girl image of Barbie has remained intact . The same can be said for her erstwhile boyfriend , Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insincere smile made him synonymous with gorgeous , vacant men everywhere , Ken has been hanging around for 28 years . And despite all Barbie ' s lingerie , there has never been the breath of scandal nor the peal of wedding bells . According to Amerman , there never will be . Anyway , Barbie has been busy . Originally a high-fashion consumer with no discernible source of income , she did a stint as a ballerina , nurse and astronaut in the ' 60s ; cooled out as a flower child ; then revved up as an Olympic athlete in the ' 70s and has been working hard as a doctor , aerobics coach , rock star and yuppie executive in the ' 80s . For her pink jubilee , Barbie heads back to the future , loitering at the " soda shoppe " by day and hitting the limelight by night as " SuperStar Barbie , " a sort of Diana Ross with platinum blond hair who drives a Ferrari . Her fans were thrilled . Ever the good-time girl , a Barbie went home with every guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto .
