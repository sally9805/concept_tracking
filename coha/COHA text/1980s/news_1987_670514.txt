Mr. Goetz ' s lead defense lawyer agreed in his opening remarks to the jury that right and wrong had been twisted , but he said the justice system had done so , not Mr. Goetz. // " Bernhard Goetz was surrounded by four mean , vicious-looking men with no pity in their eyes , " said the defense lawyer , Barry I. Slotnick . " Let no one kid you - he ' s the victim - and now he ' s a double victim by being here in the courtroom. " // // An ' Emotional Powder Keg ' // The often passionate statements came in the first day of Mr. Goetz ' s long-delayed trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on attempted murder , illegal weapon , reckless endangerment and assault charges stemming from the subway shooting in December 1984. // Mr. Goetz , a 39-year-old electrical engineer , has said he was about to be robbed and he acted in self-defense in shooting his attackers with an unlicensed revolver . His actions , and subsequent prosecution , have made him a symbol to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who applaud him for defending himself. // The Assistant District Attorney , Gregory L. Waples , said the evidence would show that on the early afternoon of Dec. 22 , 1984 , when the shootings occurred on the downtown No. 2 train , Mr. Goetz was " not a typical New Yorker , not a reasonable person such as yourself , " but rather , " an emotional powder keg one spark away from a violent explosion. " #2 Men Who Were Shot to Testify In his hourlong statement to the eight men and four women who make up the jury , Mr. Waples repeatedly addressed Mr. Goetz ' s mental state and sense of values at the time of the shooting , implying that the threat Mr. Goetz faced was not as real as it may have appeared to the defendant. // He said Mr. Goetz had fired his weapon at the young men - two of whom are expected to testify - because " they were the type of people he hated with an all-consuming passion " and not because of their specific acts . Mr. Waples described Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had to carry a gun. " // Mr. Slotnick , pacing before the jurors in a two-hour address that was , like Mr. Waples ' s , given largely without notes , called the prosecutor ' s statements about Mr. Goetz " insulting. " // " We have no obligation to submit to street violence , " Mr. Slotnick said . " No one can walk up to me and say ' Give me that watch , or that ring , or $5 . ' If they do , heaven help them if I ' m armed because I know what the law allows . " Mr. Goetz , he said , " did what the law allowed. " // Mr. Waples , who is required under law to outline what the prosecution will attempt to prove in its case , said a major element of the evidence against Mr. Goetz would be statements that he made on video and audio tape in Concord , N.H. , where he surrendered to the police on New Year ' s Eve in 1984. // In those taped statements , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the jury this week , Mr. Goetz spoke of seeing one of the victims , Darrell Cabey , unharmed after the other three had fallen . According to Mr. Waples , Mr. Goetz said " You don ' t look so bad , here ' s another . " Mr. Cabey was paralyzed by the shooting. // The defense , Mr. Waples said , can not " paper over " the fact that " this was little more than a cold-blooded execution or attempted execution . " <> <> ' Full of Stress and Fear ' // Mr. Slotnick , while tacitly admitting that the taped statements could cause a problem for the defense , urged the jury to listen to the tapes as a whole . He said Mr. Goetz was in a frenzy at the time of the shootings and that his own memory of the event may have betrayed him. // " The mind of Bernhard Goetz was full of stress and fear and may have recounted a lot of things that didn ' t happen , " Mr. Slotnick said. // The lawyers ' statements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s encounter on the subway that day . Mr. Waples described the subway car as " lurching and swaying in the peculiar rhythm characteristic of the New York City subway system , " while Mr. Slotnick discussed the body language and manner of the " vicious predators " who surrounded Mr. Goetz in the preface to what he said had been a robbery attempt. // Mr. Slotnick also discussed what he said were the surreal elements of the case and the reversals in roles . <> <> Turned Upside Down // " Quite frankly , we ' re proceeding in the ' Twilight Zone , ' " Mr. Slotnick said . " Everything you see in this courtroom will be contrary to what you know of the law of American justice . Everything ' s turned upside down. " // He told the jurors , for example , that he would be " prosecuting " the four shooting victims on robbery charges in the course of defending Mr. Goetz because that , in effect , is his defense : A robbery was taking place . He said the final question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goetz was guilty or not guilty , but rather why the four men had not been charged. // Mr. Slotnick said the credibility of the shooting victims would be called into question by their past criminal acts and by the fact that they were given immunity from prosecution in the case in exchange for their testimony before the grand jury that indicted Mr. Goetz in March 1985. // Two of the four victims , James Ramseur and Barry Allen , are serving sentences in state prison for unrelated crimes . The fourth victim , Troy Canty , is currently in a drug rehabilitation center in Westchester County. // Mr. Waples , who spoke first , also discussed the criminal records of the victims who would testify . But he said their testimony was not crucial. // " You can ignore any or all of the testimony of the victims , " he said . Mr. Goetz ' s own statements , he repeated , would be the key to the trial and means by which the jurors could " peer into the defendant ' s mind. " // Mr. Goetz faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most serious charges in the case , but would be expected to serve far less than that because he has no previous criminal record. //
