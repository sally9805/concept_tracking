While spread of the fever in this country is unlikely , the death is a vivid reminder that in an age of jet travel , exotic diseases usually confined to remote areas can show up anywhere anytime . And this can present particular problems for physicians , who typically do not immediately look for exotic diseases. // Indeed , doctors are taught to think of common treatable conditions first . The expression , " When you hear hoofbeats , don ' t think of zebras , " is often repeated on hospital rounds. // With Lassa fever , in particular , diagnosis can be tricky . The disease , named for the small town in northeastern Nigeria where it was first recognized , mimics other viral infections in its early stages . Eventually , however , some patients develop more serious symptoms , including severe vomiting , bleeding and a high fever. // The disease can be fatal , but early treatment is often successful . Still , it remains a major health problem in western and central Africa. // The virus that causes the disease was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yale University found it after studying specimens from three nurses who contracted the disease ; two of them died , while the third survived after flying to New York for care. // The deadly reputation of the virus was enhanced after two Yale workers became infected in a lab accident and one died . Research was moved to a secure laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. // The latest American case involved a 43-year-old mechanical engineer from Glen Ellyn , Ill . His name has not been disclosed , and health workers are still investigating the case . They are observing family members , hospital workers and others with whom he came in close contact for evidence of Lassa fever . The widow and children are receiving the antiviral agent ribavirin as a precaution. // Dr. Robert A. Chase , a specialist in infectious diseases who consulted in the last stages of the case , said the man flew to Nigeria for his mother ' s funeral . She died on Jan. 13 with fevers that her doctors attributed to malaria . The engineer ' s father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a brother may also have been ill recently. // The engineer felt well when he returned to Chicago on Feb. 1 . Two days later , when he developed a headache and fever of 101 degrees , his symptoms were attributed to influenza , which was striking thousands of other people in the area at the time. // A week later he developed a sore throat that did not respond to antibiotics . A few days later , when he went to a clinic again , blood tests showed severe liver damage . He was admitted to Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield , Ill. , on Feb. 15 . His fever reached 103 degrees. // When Dr. Chase first saw the engineer , he was breathing four times as fast as normal , 80 times a minute . His face was swollen . He bled from the bowel and was in shock , reflecting collapse of the circulatory system. // Although there was liver damage , Dr. Chase noted features that distinguished the case from severe hepatitis : the skin was not yellow from jaundice and he was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to suspect a viral hemorrhagic fever , meaning a disease that can cause severe bleeding . But which one ? Dr. Chase called the C.D.C. and determined that Lassa fever was the best bet , although lab studies would be needed to confirm the diagnosis. // Dr. Chase then called ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Costa Mesa , Calif. , for intravenous ribavirin . ICN has not received approval to market the ribavirin , but the Food and Drug Administration immediately gave Dr. Chase clearance to use it. // Unfortunately , the shipment arrived a few hours after the man died on Feb. 16 . In the final hours , Dr. Chase said , the man was beyond saving . " Nothing was going to help , " Dr. Chase said . " Even if he got ribavirin the moment I saw him , it wouldn ' t have altered the outcome. " // Dr. Chase said it was logical for the doctors who first treated the man to think of the flu and other common illnesses . Even in travelers from Africa , experts stress that doctors should exclude common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes fail to ask soon enough about a patient ' s recent travels . Since jets fly faster than the incubation period of nearly all infectious diseases , a traveler may not become ill for days , or even months. // The sore throat , fever , malaise and other early symptoms of Lassa fever typically begin from 7 to 17 days after the virus enters the body . Several days or weeks later , the infection can cause pains in the joints and lower back , cough , headache , abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhea and facial swelling . It can also deafen survivors. // In Africa , the virus is spread primarily by the rat Mastomys natalensis . Most human infections are attributed to rat droppings or urine on beds and food. // In western and central Africa , up to 300 , 000 infections and 5 , 000 deaths occur each year , making Lassa fever possibly the major public health problem in some areas , reported Dr. Joseph B. McCormick , who has studied the disease in Africa . In some areas the virus has infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than malaria , which is believed to be the leading killer in Africa. // In hospitals in infected areas , the fever is the leading killer of pregnant women , accounting for 25 percent of maternal deaths . The virus also devastates fetuses and newborns. // Studies have shown , however , that the fever often causes only mild infections in Africa and is not as contagious or lethal as once thought. // Moreover , researchers have found that ribavirin is dramatically effective in treating the illness , particularly if given in the first week . The scientists have also developed an experimental vaccine that may someday prevent the disease. //
