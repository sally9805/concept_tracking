Abraham Lincoln compared its power to the surging Mississippi River . Jane Austen found it so indispensable that she ironed it out when it was damp . Thackeray endured its " rather shabby pay , " Coleridge tried in vain to join its staff , and Dickens endured its critical contempt . It accompanied the Light Brigade to the Valley of Death in the Crimea , and climbed with Edmund Hillary up Mount Everest . Although it proudly displays the royal coat of arms on its masthead , in an 1830 obituary it described the standard of conduct of King George IV as " little higher than that of animal indulgence , " and when Queen Victoria wrote a letter answering its criticism , the editors declined to publish it on the ground that they had printed one letter from her already . <P> The subject of this veneration and occasional abuse is the London Times . Founded in 1785 , it still commands the attention of Britain 's highest and mightiest . Last week , at the acme of a 200th-anniversary celebration that has already included two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals , the paper played host for four hours to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip . Dressed in a plaid suit and mauve hat , Her Majesty visited the freshly painted newsroom , known as " the pit , " and chatted with dozens of employees , from reporters in white shirts to pressmen in working clothes . The paper 's labor editor caused a brief commotion when he told BBC radio listeners that the Queen had commented on the cause of a protracted miners ' strike ; the royal family is expected not to discuss politics , and the paper quickly retracted the remarks . The Queen Mother still plans to come to lunch . And Prince Charles and Princess Diana are scheduled to attend an outdoor Times gala complete with fireworks at Hampton Court Palace in July . <P> The jubilation has been made all the more exuberant by the recollection that the paper has repeatedly seemed likely to die .

When he found one , his choice seemed to much of the staff , and to many of the Times 's top-drawer readers , a fate worse than death : Australian Press Lord Rupert Murdoch , proprietor of the tabloid daily Sun , which features screaming headlines and photographs of naked women , and the equally lowbrow Sunday News of the World . As proof of his good intentions , Murdoch recruited Harold Evans , for 14 years the esteemed editor of the separate Sunday Times , to run the daily edition ; within 13 months , Murdoch sacked him . Like his predecessor , Murdoch confronted unions and threatened to shut down forever . <P> During 1984 , however , daily circulation jumped 23.6% , to 457,000 , and advertising grew to 33% of the total page space ( compared with 28% three years ago ) . Indeed , Murdoch now projects that the Times will go into the black by June , for the first time since 1977.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
