Paul Taylor 's new work : virtuosity at 1,000 r.p.m . <P> Back in the ' 60s when the Paul Taylor Dance Company traveled to the hinterlands , people mistook the troupe for the June Taylor Dancers from the Jackie Gleason Show . The confusion ended at curtain time . Then , instead of metronomic chorines , the stage was peopled with muscular , disciplined dancers falling , posturing and accelerating to everything from Bach to Cage . Dressed as Elizabethan figures or satyrs in evening clothes , or in nothing more than bath towels , the company disturbed as many as it dazzled . <P> Since those days , the phenomenal popularity of dance has made sophisticates of the most provincial audiences . Yet even in New York City , epicenter of the modern movement , the 27-year-old Taylor company has retained its power to astonish . At the City Center the dancers are currently providing evening after evening of crackling wit and virtuosity under the hand of a master . <P> Taylor , 51 , has taken the rich vocabulary of dance , from the spine-straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham , and shaped it into a shifting and special language . He is the J.R.R. Tolkien of his form , and like the fabulist creates works too elaborate to please the avant-garde and too impudent for purists . In short , Taylor remains one of the most accessible of choreographers . <P> In Lost , Found and Lost , premiered two weeks ago , for example , the subject is false sophistication . The music : airport Muzak . Charmaine sugarcoats the strings in one segment as dancers posture wearily in line , shuffling forward slowly . Fond of reconciling opposites , Taylor was struck by the idea in a dentist 's office . " I used to ask him to turn off the wallpaper music , " he says . " But then I started listening . " Banality has never been as vibrant as it is under his direction . In black costumes with veils , designed by Artist Alex Katz , dancers stare into space , scratch , arrange hips and arms into poses of boredom , with hilarious bursts of writhing impatience . The work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on normal street gestures . In his treatment of walking , standing and running-staples of the form-Taylor is like Henry Higgins remodeling Eliza Doolittle . <P> Taylor has always tested limits . Older pieces ( going back as far as 1956 ) included in the current program confirm the breadth of his skill . Le Sucre du Printemps ( The Rehearsal ) ( 1980 ) pits a Chicago-style gangster and his moll against gray-clad ciphers in a workers ' state , concluding in a massacre . Private Domain ( 1969 ) exposes a beach full of muscle builders , sexual athletes and Esther Williams-style chorus lines . Orbs ( 1966 ) harks back to the wedding scene in Martha Graham 's landmark Appalachian Spring . Here , however , the screwball marriage takes place in " Terrestrial Autumn , " where a drunk polkas with a rubber turkey .
