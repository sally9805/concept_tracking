TI PIAO IRJ =c1 TAIL A short story by John Podhoretz GI OD ONLY KNOWS what goes on in a little kid 's mind . When my son Alex was four , he once became enraged 1 when he turned on the television and there was no " Batman . " I explained that " Batman " came on only after dinner , not before , but he kept flicking the dial back and forth , until finally he shut the set off , jumped up and down a bit , and burst into tears . At times like this all you can do is grab him , hug him , and keep from laughing until he has calmed down a little . I wish I could figure out what goes on when Alex sits down at the piano . It always begins well : he sits , plays his scales , opens his BartOk book , and wonderful things begin to happen . He does not play with authority , but those hands , once a fraction the size of mine , can now stroll along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , as we say , very good for his age . But for some reason he always gets furious midway through his practicing and slams the cover down on the keys and goes into his room and lies on his bed with his thumb in his mouth . I am now sitting in the living room of my son 's piano teacher ; it is raining outside , and I am hoping that my shoes did not bring the street in with me . The beige walls are covered with those Picasso and Min5 prints you can pick up for a song on Third Avenue and the beautiful old wooden floor is partially covered by a beautiful old Oriental rug , which is slightly frayed at the edges . All around me are couples , men and women who seem much , much older than 1 . I thought as I left my apartment that I looked the image of the young , successful , good-looking , easygoing , complacent New York-Jewish divorce , in my gold corduroy jacket , jeans , and white shirt without tie . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , like the older brother of a performer rather than a parent . We all glance at one another , wondering who will be the mother of the great prodigy , who the fatherof the fuck-up . Knowing that we are participants in a living clich ? , we all play our parts , sitting quietly in thought , reminiscing about our own childhood recitals . Things begin to come to me as old photographs , faded at their edges , faded around the light inside them , yet made paradoxically clear by their age and dullness . I can not see my parents ' faces , but I can see their silhouetted forms , my father with his tweed hat on his lap , my mother with her hair pinned up , like a Victorian lady . In fact , everything seems Victorian  --  my stern teacher standing against the piano , the piano itself , my Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit . I mistrust the memory , however . I am , after all , only thirty years old and my own past is actually recorded in sharp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books to which pictures of Alex have been added as he has grown . But all I can think of is light , the light that shone through the windows of an old West Side apartment similar to the one in which I am now . It was spring then , too ; the scene would be completely duplicated if it were not raining powerfully outside . I wonder what the fellow next to me is thinking , in his three-piece Brooks Brothers suit and unfashionable short and greased haircut . I notice that he speaks in an accent ? French maybe , or German ; it is difficult to tell because he is whispering . I wonder what his wife thinks ; she appears to be about forty , and has on her lap a young boy , probably the brother of a performer , dressed in a blazer and yellow tie . The child is squirming a little , but he is well-mannered nonetheless . The couple next to them , on a little love seat , seem nervous ; they keep looking to the double doors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child or to wave or even to make sure that the kid is going to come out at all . Around the room everyone is in a tableau , each person registering a different emotion . I am sitting alone , the only father without a wife . I wish I had brought the Sunday Times magazine with me so I could do the crossword puzzle . I chain-smoke instead . I guess my normally reasonable mother must have gotten an idea somewhere that it was cute and stylish to dress a child in antiquated clothes . I must have been subjected to the most awful scrutiny on the subway . I have no memory of any of it . " She frequently looks down at her hands to see how they are doing . " IL AST NIGHT the phone rang . It was Alex 's mother telling me she could not come to the recital and would I please tell Alex , since it was late and he was asleep . It is okay , she said , mother or father . He knows I care about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . She was the only Smith girl I had ever met who was both Jewish and looked like Hester Prynne . The double doors finally open , and ten or twelve children walk in and sit down on the floor next to the piano . Alex is looking at the rug as he comes in , so there is no way for me to say hello . I see , though , that his blazer collar is turned up at the back and that his tie has conic out over the button . On the top of his lips is a faint white moustache ? they must all have had milk and cookies in the kitchen before their entrance . I suppress an urge to go over and straighten him up . My little boy . He was an immaculate baby , much to his mother 's relief . He hardly ever spit up , and when he began to feed himself he had the remarkable ability to get a great deal of his food inside his mouth . And his clothes never got dirty ; I guess he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't eat a hamburger without getting a ketchup stain somewhere . But now he can not keep his shirttail tucked in , can not keep his face clean . He does brush his teeth , but only out of terror of cavities . I wash his hair myself  --  I do n't know how his mother handles it . Alex 's piano teacher , **60;2427;TOOLONG , squats down in front of her pupils and kisses each one of them on the cheek . When I was a kid it was all you could do to wring a smile out of Mrs. Platt . Andrea stops by Alex , mercifully straightening his collar and his tie and whispering into his ear . I can see only the back of his head , where his dark curls are going every which way . Andrea stands , leaning on the piano . And then it is as if sunlight begins to stream through the windows , and it is no longer Andrea there , but Mrs. Platt , whose face I can not see because of the long shadows . And I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little folding chair . I am not eight years old ; I can never be eight again . I sit there in my Manhattan finery , not in that ridiculous outfit with blue tie and blue beanie . TIE SUNLIGHT fades , and I am still sitting in that folding chair . but it is both Mrs. Platt and Andrea who lean on the piano . They appear to be the same size , one figure , the body of Mrs. Platt and the face of Andrea . " We are fortunate to have you here today . Music is .... " Now I am no longer sitting on that little chair . I see Alex 's head swaying slightly back and forth , his hands clapping at his sides in a steady rhythm . He is not used to sitting still . I wish we could be going to a movie . I know how much he must be hating all of this . He told me that his mother had told him it was not really important for him to play in the recital , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to play in the recital . I am the bad guy . I wish we could be going to a movie . A little girl rises from the floor and goes to the piano . She looks extraordinarily elegant , with her thick and long blond-red hair and matching red jacket , skirt . and shirt . She seems composed as she sits down , but then I notice a rather glassy look in her eye . She is trembling slightly . She does not want to start . She stares at the keyboard for a little while . At last she raises her hands over the keys  --  and lowers them again . She glances at Andrea , who nods almost imperceptibly . She reaches out once more , closes her eyes , opens them again , and begins . She is playing a simple piece by one of Bach 's offspring , and the coolness of the baroque repetition appears to calm her . She can not manage to keep the tone constant , but there is a lovely melody coming from the piano . She frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . Okay . And then , for the first time , she plays a wrong note . Flatness hits our ears , and we all wince ever so slightly . The girl appears momentarily unsure whether to go back or to continue . She decides to go on , and finishes soon after . There is much applause and smiling . The woman who applauds and smiles the most is obviously the girl 's mother , and she looks as if she could swoon with pleasure . Her daughter is maybe seven years old . The girl 's expression , as she gets down on the floor once more , is full of both relief and shame . That one false note is probably reverberating in her mind ; she is a perfectionist like all children , unsatisfied and confused when everything is not clean and set and fixed . Tonight , as she goes to sleep , she will first remember the applause , the lovely applause , and then pause to consider how much louder it would have been if she had not made that mistake , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damnable , imperfect mistake . C HILDREN ARE so megalomaniacal , after all . When Alex was just beginning to talk in complete sentences , he only felt comfortable using the first person . He knew that he could not be sure of anything except his own thoughts , and so everything came out as " I , " blissfully sell-absorbed and absolutely rootless . " I think you like me . " " Do I know your food ? " This last as a means of asking if he could taste what was on my plate . Later on , I would ask him what he wanted for lunch , and he would reply , " Baloney , of course ! " and emphatically roll his eyes in amazement at my ignorance of obvious fact and absolute reality . Still later came the " Mommy said " gambit : I would tell him to brush his teeth , or comb his hair , and he would say " Mommy said I do n't have to " or " Mommy said I 'm allergic . " At the ripe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was allergic to shampoo , to toothpaste , to soap . A sharp kid  --  his mother once suspected that he was allergic to oranges , and so he was tested . No allergy , but a memory of what the connotations of " allergy " were . I was a lousy disciplinarian when it came to things like this . He outwitted me , he held his own , and all I wanted to do was admit bemused defeat . I gave in more times than I wish to recall . After all , he looks like me , talks Iike me , sticks his hands in his pockets like me , and even curses the way I do . I foresaw the cursing , and have managed to keep my temper around him , so I feel genuinely triumphant when I hear him mutter " Jeez " instead of something stronger . I always come back to the time when he was twenty-three months old , and I heard him as he lay in bed singing " Shit , shit , shit " to himself in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started again . I realized that he must have overheard his mother and me in one of our less subdued conversations . I felt ashamed and yet astonished it seemed that the anger and vibrating tension between his parents had meant nothing to him , all that he heard was a funny-sounding new word he felt obliged to practice . I suppose that twenty years from now , in some session in a futuristic room with a fag psychoanalyst , he might dredge up the memory and decide that his life ended that day , but I was there . and there was no sublimation , no inhibition , no hidden mystery  --  only a large-eyed and sweet-natured little boy who heard his parents with the volume level turned up and discovered a neat new word . Another little girl goes to the piano and begins to play . I know that Alex 's turn will be coming soon , and I feel weak with anticipation . Time must be moving especially slowly for him now , but time always moves slowly for children ; they have nothing to relate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might help them to see that life is very far from over when they feel defeated and lost . I know that Alex is an unhappy child . So was I ; I know I was . But I am graced with the kind of adult knowledge he will not be able to understand for a long time , which is that by the time you are old enough to comprehend that there is really nothing to be done about such unhappiness you are , at last , actually in the position to do something about it . Alex 's unhappiness is fairly natural and inevitable . He is the child of divorced parents , parents who expect and think wildly different things of him and who appreciate him in very different ways . He has a mother who is with him most of the time . He has a father who is , for better or for worse , really an exceptionally close uncle . My influence on him is an absent influence ; my effect on him is sporadic . He will come to know that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself and act independently . But now he is quite fatherless . 11 THINK THE world would be better off if there were no such thing as divorce . I remember my grandparents sitting in their Brooklyn apartment and saying maybe five words to each other every day for fifteen years . They hated each other . No  --  she was a shrewish rock and he was a sullen loafer , and together they did not exactly make music . But they stayed together . Oh , she would walk out on him , go to live with her daughters , with her brother , and even , for one fabled week , with me and Alex 's mother . It was n't that she worried for her reputation , and he certainly did n't care ; something primordial and powerful bound them , and that was parenthood . They remained together . You have to live , you have to feed yourself ; if you are lucky you have success and prestige as well as a happy married life . But the world becomes a different place when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets . I know now that I should not have let Alex 's mother divorce me . I did so want it , though . But I know that I should not have let her do it . And I also know that Alex will get over his difficulties . He is , it is true , a mess . He can not do his schoolwork , he has no friends , his shoulders bear the weight of the outcast and the unconventionalist . But he will not remember the pain later on ; you can not feel pain in a dream . Still , how can a child understand that past pain means nothing to the future ? Suddenly I hear Alex 's name spoken and I sit up , extinguish my cigarette and clean my glasses . By the time I put my glasses on again , Alex is sitting in front of the piano and the applause that greeted the mention of his name has died down . He looks toward me , and I doff an imaginary hat to him . I blow him a kiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . They are really small even now ; they rest perilously close to the edge of the keys because he did not remember to pull the bench in . He is smaller than a lot of girls his age , including those that played before him . His refusal to pull the bench closer to the piano is like a gesture of defiance : If they can do it , so can I. My mind is moving so quickly that it is as if the whole room were encased in amber and I were outside peering in . The parents of the two girls who went before recline calmly ; their test is over and they have the knowledge of blissful relief and contemplative pride . The other parents concentrate on Alex at the piano , probably thinking how I must be feeling or for their own part feeling genuinely interested in how he will fare . Andrea sits alert , her eyes cast upon Alex 's resting hands . The little girls who have played seem bored , and the other kids are stiff with terror . Alex himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looks too soft and pliable to be controlled that way from within . His eyes stare blankly at the music in front of him and he looks drowsy . I will remember that face , I will not forget that face : the little child 's first palpable challenge . His first tentative step away from me . I breathe in deeply ; all movement resumes , and Alex begins to play . His piece is a Bar-VII ( dance , which I myself practiced when I was young . It is deceptively tricky : its harsh , staccato style is actually perfectly rhythmic and repetitious and reassuring . Alex plays beautifully : his tone is consistent , his control impeccable . I see a couple of people glance at each other with impressed looks . Andrea 's head nods up and down with the music , a small smile on her lips . It is a truly rousing performance . It is a wonder the way things work out . I could never play the piece Alex is now triumphing with , but he thinks I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoopee " and he ca n't . Would it matter to him that I was taught by rote , in college , and that each tune took me months and months to learn ? Would it matter that I can not read music anymore , that he , twenty-two years younger . is actually a better musician than I ? Would it matter that I was always the one to play badly at recitals , that I had nothing but a sullen word for anyone when I was his age , that I was sent to see a shrink at the age of nine , a Freudian who would not talk , and in whose presence I only picked my nose ? Would it matter that I made my parents weep with worry for my future ? Would it matter that I know , from my own past , that all will turn out well for Alex ? No . He is a small thing in a world run by larger things , men , women , buildings , teachers , mothers , fathers , cars , girls his own age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but which he valiantly tries to get through , crowds , families , potential stepmothers and stepfathers , doormen , elevator buttons , locks , cabinets , the shelf with the crystal on it , New York City , most every-66 thing else . He has no younger sibling , he has nothing to feel bigger than besides the children he sees on the street and some of his infant cousins . He is just a little taller than the piano he is playing , but he has made it his own , and subservient to his hands . My mind reels with his imagined persecutions and his real difficulties . It is truly awful to be a child . But at some point , a point that is to come soon if his display today means anything , he will no longer be a child , and will never be a child again . And with his smile , and his looks , and his spirit , things should be pretty good . Alex looks at the keys nervously even as he plays with such striking ability . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he goes on , he loses the rhythm slightly . So he delays slightly on one " three " note , and catches up again . People once more look to one another and smile ; my son has managed to pull a trick many professionals find difficult to accomplish . With a fluorish : DA da da DA da da DA da DA DA ! he finishes . I applaud first , with such heart and force that everyone turns toward me . I am smiling so widely that my cheeks begin to hurt . Most of the applause is loud and fast ; Alex quickly sits down on the floor and looks straight ahead . My vision is obscured by a queer liquid glaze . I look to the ceiling , and out the window , and through them both . The recital continues , but to my eyes all is sped up . Children rise and sit down again quickly . The music is distorted . All action seems jerky and of short duration . Only Andrea appears the same , full of concern and concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pupils ' backs to the outline of their faces to their hands to their audience . ND IT is over . Everyone groans , rising from a position maintained for more than an hour . Parents move to their children , as I move to my son , but he has gone off to the bathroom . I walk up to Andrea and congratulate her . She says , did n't he do wonderfully . And I say , yes , oh yes . Someone else comes up to greet her . I take a little white wine and a piece of cheese from the buffet table . Alex walks into the room shyly . I go toward him , and wait as a couple of adults say nice things to him . He smiles hesitantly and thanks them . Then he is standing there and I look him wryly in the eye , then swoop him up into my arms . You were terrific , just terrific , really terrific , I am so proud . He receives a kiss from Andrea , and I stand around and compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say our goodbyes ; Alex collects another kiss from his teacher and thanks everyone again . We walk out the door and he reaches up and presses the " down " button in the elevator hall . I say nothing , I only smile . He does not meet my gaze  --  out of embarrassment , perhaps . I ask him if he wants to go to a movie before I take him home to his mother . He only shakes his head , his eyes on the floor . 1 ruffle his hair , and he moves his head away from my hand . His eyes remain directed at the ground , then at the elevator door as it opens to the lobby . I wonder what is wrong with him . We get to the street and I hail a cab . It is not raining anymore , but the wind is whipping about us . When we climb inside , Alex sits as far from me as possible . I give the driver the address . Alex refuses to look at me . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " but you were terrific this afternoon . You really were . You were the best of everybody . " Alex mumbles something I ca n't hear . " What ? " He turns to look at me . His face is tight and his eyes flash with anger . " I was not . I was terrible . I was terrible . Everybody knew it too . I was terrible . " I can not help laughing . " Are you kidding ? Everybody thought you were brilliant . You were brilliant . Honest . What 's bothering you ? " He slides toward me . And suddenly he is swinging his arms , hitting me a few times in the chest . I am stunned with surprise . I raise my own hand , when , again to my astonishment , he begins to cry , and grabs onto my neck with his arms . I sit him on my Iap and stroke his head . " You really are a yo-yo , you know that ? " I chuckle as I say it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sobs . " I was doing okay and then I got off heat . " " But you were great ! I would n't lie to you , " knowing full well that I would if I had to . " Why do I always do it wrong ? Why do n't I ever do things right ? Why ca n't I do anything right , " he says , and paroxysms of weeping begin . And I stare at him with awe , without understanding . And I begin to cry as well , holding him fast . " Oh , Alex , " I say softly , and with a force of knowledge I can not believe exists . " Everything is going to be all right . Oh , Alex , I wish you could believe me . Everything is going to be all right . " ?
